The site suspended all functionality‚Äîincluding verifying the seven-digit identification codes of previously issued Verrit cards‚Äîon February 11, 2018, with the website replaced by only the words: \\"Reboots Summer 2018\\". No warning or explanation was given for the suspension. As of May 2019, the domainredirects to the now-suspended Twitter profile This comes on the heels of Peter Daou bowing out of public activism. As of January 2019, the domain redirected to Verrit's Twitter profile, an account which as of May 2019 has been suspended. The website's slogan said it was \\"media for the 65.8 million,\\" referring to the number of votes Hillary Clinton received in the 2016 presidential election. Daou, an adviser to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, and prior chief executive of Shareblue told Business Insider that he intended the website to \\"reflect the worldview\\" of those who voted for Clinton and described the site as an \\"online hub for Clinton backers so that they can find easy-to-share facts, stats and other information you can take out to social media when you're having debates on key issues people are discussing\\". Daou also said the website had no financial ties to Clinton. On September 3, 2017, Clinton endorsed the service. Shortly thereafter, the site went offline, which Daou blamed on a \\"significant and sophisticated\\" cyber attack. Five months later, the site remained offline. When a journalist for Splinter News contacted company representatives requesting comment on its status, he reports he was blocked by the company's Twitter account. Response Abby Ohlheiser at The Washington Post said she guessed the site is \\"supposed to be something that's useful for Clinton supporters who like to argue online about politics\\". TechCrunch called it \\"a fledgling media startup that's aiming to provide a platform for Hillary supporters to look at infographics with quotes on them about stuff they agree with\\". Politico's Jack Shafer described Verrit as \\"a propaganda rag so shameless it would make Kim Jong Un blush\\". The Observer wrote, \\"We didn't find any outright fabrications, but we did find signs that the site is more focused on advancing its messaging than proper sourcing\\". Matthew Hews from TheNextWeb wrote, \\"From the get-go, it's apparent that Verrit isn't about building bridges or creating understanding, but rather pushing a particular narrative.

It was deactivated in 1874 and destroyed sometime after 1923. History This light was built in Stephen Pleasonton's administration, and the light was commonly referred as \\"Pleasonton's Light\\". While construction funds were provided in 1831, the light was not completed until two years later, built according to the usual plan of the time of a conical masonry tower housing an array of ten Argand lamps with reflectors; this was eventually replaced with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It was located on present-day Rabbit Island (then named Pleasonton Island) opposite the mouth of the Pearl River. While the original keeper Isaac H. Smith served for seven years, his immediate successors were not so creditable: the first was dismissed for drunkenness, and from 1840 to 1844 there were no less than five keepers. Not surprisingly, the state of the light suffered. Like other southern lights, it was extinguished at the commencement of the Civil War, but was relit in November 1862. In 1868, the lantern was replaced, with the top of the tower being rebuilt to hold it. The light was extinguished in 1874, however, having been deemed unnecessary. The tower remained as a landmark for many years thereafter, finally being sold in 1923 and destroyed sometime thereafter.

The country's inaugural ambassador to Comoros, Mubarak bin Abdulrahman Al Nasser, presented his credentials to the president of Comoros in November 2014. Comoros maintains an embassy in Doha, Qatar. It appointed its first ambassador to Qatar, Hadji Abdallah Abdoulhamid, in January 2014. His tenure ended in January 2016. Qatar expelled Comoros' representatives in the country on 19 June 2017, after it severed ties with Doha, giving them 48 hours to leave the country. Diplomatic visits On 22 April 2010, Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani became the first Arab head of state to pay an official visit to Comoros. While there, he extended an offer of 20 million euros to the Comoros government for it to pay the salaries of its civil servants. President Ahmed Sambi confirmed that the money was deposited into the Comoros central bank in May 2010. Diplomatic cooperation 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis On 7 June 2017, Comoros cut ties with Qatar, following the lead of several other countries led by a quartet composed of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Shortly after, there were some demonstrations held in the Comoros capital of Moroni which protested against this decision. Five members of the Comoros- Qatar Friendship Association were arrested by Comoran authorities on 19 June, but were released after 24 hours. Former president Ahmed Sambi condemned the decision to sever ties, saying that Qatar was a \\"friendly country\\". Foreign aid and investments Qatar hosted a donors conference in March 2010, during which $540 million was pledged for the development of Comoros by Arab-based donors. Qatari-based organizations pledged $200 million towards Comoros' development during the conference. In the aftermath of the conference, Qatar National Hotels Company, a government-owned organization, signed a deal with the Comoran government to build a $70 million hotel resort in Comoros in April 2010. Qatar Charity became the first philanthropic organization to open a field office in Moroni, the capital city of Comoros, in 2010. At a meeting held by the Arab Committee for Development and Investment in the Comoros in February 2011, Qatar Charity stated that it was executing QR10 million worth of projects, and said it would donate an additional QR55 million towards social development, education and health projects within the upcoming years. In the following years, Qatar Charity spent QR2 million on refurbishing health clinics and schools in Moh√©li. Jassim and Hamad bin Jassim Charitable Foundation announced it would be constructing a $37 million hospital in Anjouan in 2011. Furthermore, the organization launched a QR4 million cultural complex in Comoros in September 2014. The complex was planned to feature Arabic as well as local Comoran architectural elements. Following Comoros' severing of ties with Qatar in June 2017, local media reported that two local Qatari charities, RAF and Qatar Charity, were suspending their activities in the country. Reports also claimed that the $37 million under-construction hospital in Anjouan was put on hold for the time being. It was speculated that the cessation of philanthropic activities by Qatar was a retaliatory measure against Comoros' alignment with the Saudi-led quartet in their diplomatic spat.

Consequently, Wilson was able not merely to hold Wyoming from 1912, but to increase his margin by over ten percentage points to carry the state by 12.76 percent.

She is the author of the book Kill All Normies, published by Zero Books in 2017, which discusses the role of the internet in the rise of the alt-right and incel movements. Nagle describes the alt-right as a dangerous movement, but she also criticizes aspects of the left that have, she says, contributed to the alt-right's rise.  Life  Nagle graduated from Dublin City University with a PhD for a thesis titled 'An investigation into contemporary online anti-feminist movements'.  The alt- right and the culture wars  Nagle's book Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars from 4chan and Tumblr to Trump and the Alt-Right discusses the role of the internet in the rise of the alt-right and incel movements. She describes the alt-right as a counterculture of young men who reject taboos on race and gender. While many young people in the alt-right started simply as trolls, she says the movement has developed into something much more serious. While she supports identity politics in general, she says that some on the left have contributed to the rise of the alt-right with their \\"performative wokeness\\", which often involves censoring people and ganging up on them. The book received many positive reviews, and Nagle became a welcome commentator on the topic of online culture wars. Columnist Ross Douthat of The New York Times praised Nagle's \\"portrait of the online cultural war\\". Another New York Times contributor, Michelle Goldberg, wrote that Kill All Normies had \\"captured this phenomenon\\". Novelist George Saunders listed Kill All Normies as one of his ten favorite books. An episode of the Fusion Networks' TV series Trumpland directed by Leighton Woodhouse was based on Kill All Normies. In May 2018, The Daily Beast accused Nagle of \\"sloppy sourcing\\", including not citing sources and drawing heavily from Wikipedia and RationalWiki. Nagle and her publisher both issued detailed statements rebutting the accusations, and The Daily Beast adjusted some of the article's wording.

Designed by Howard Koslow, it commemorates the ten-year anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, and is notable as Koslow's first postage stamp design. The stamp has a face value of eight cents. One-hundred thirty million were issued. Background The Antarctic Treaty was signed on December 1, 1959 by the United States and eleven other nations involved in scientific research on the continent of Antarctica during the preceding biennium; seven of these nations ‚Äì Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom ‚Äì had competing territorial claims to Antarctica. From November 18 to November 19, 1968, the fifth consultative meeting of the state parties to the treaty was held in Paris. During it, the issue of decennial commemorative stamps by the state parties who had signed the Antarctic Treaty was recommended. Release The Antarctic Treaty issue commemorates the Antarctic Treaty which provided a framework governing access to Antarctica (pictured). The public announcement of the Antarctic Treaty issue release was made in May 1971 and it was officially released June 23, 1971, the tenth (decennial) anniversary on which the Antarctic Treaty became effective. The official release was accompanied by a first day ceremony in Washington, D.C. attended by United States Secretary of State William P. Rogers, United States Postmaster General Winton M. Blount, and the ambassadors to the United States of the state parties to the Antarctic Treaty. During the ceremony, Blount presented an album of the stamps to Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. One-hundred thirty million Antarctic Treaty issue stamps were printed. Proofs Specimens of the stamp, as well as its plate proofs, are held by the National Philatelic Collection, housed in the National Postal Museum. In 2013, the United States Postal Service (USPS) auctioned on eBay a proof of the Antarctic Treaty issue that contained the handwritten approval of Postmaster General Blount. The proof was one of two such proofs of the Antarctic Treaty issue held in the Postmaster General's Philatelic Collection. It sold for $1,099.99. Design The stamp was designed by the acclaimed American postage stamp illustrator Howard Koslow, and was notable as his first postage stamp design. It features a map of Antarctica in white, set on a field of blue, which was adapted from the logo design used on documents of the treaty's consultative meetings. Earlier, in 1965, the Special Committee on Antarctic Research of the International Council of Scientific Unions had called for stamps commemorating the decennial of the treaty to prominently feature the map of Antarctica. Due to competing territorial claims in Antarctica, the simplicity of a map-centered design was considered a matter of political importance. The stamp has an eight cents face value. Related stamps In addition to the United States, other state parties to the Antarctic Treaty also issued commemorative stamps on its ten-year anniversary. In 1991, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, the United States issued another stamp commemorating the Antarctic Treaty. Howard Koslow returned to design the fifty-cent, airmail, stamp which depicted USCGC Glacier near Ross Island.

She was president of The Belles-Lettres club, well known in western Pennsylvania, which founded a public library. Early years Emma Whitcomb was born in Adams, New York, April 24, 1849. She was the daughter of Henry Holley Whitcomb and Judith Maria Mooney Whitcomb. Career Emma Whitcomb Babcock As a writer, Babcock contributed to journals and magazines. Also a book-reviewer, she was probably best known through her series of unsized articles which during five years appeared in the New York City \\"Evening Post.\\" She was a contributor to the first number of \\"Babyhood\\" and also of the \\"Cosmopolitan.\\" She published \\"Household Hints\\" (1890), and later, \\"A Mother's Note Book.\\" She conducted a department in the Homemaker. Babcock werote a novel, which embodied many distinctive features of the oil country. Her husband's profession turned her attention to educational subjects, and she published many articles in the technical journals on those subjects. She was interested in home mission work and was president of a literary club which was known throughout western Pennsylvania, and which founded a public library. She died in 1926 and is buried in Adams Rural Cemetery, Adams, New York. Household Hints Household Hints The Philadelphia North American reviewed Household Hints, saying ‚ÄúNot only the young wife who is just setting out on her housekeeping career, but even the experienced matron, may obtain much useful information and many valuable hints from Mrs. Babcock's readable little book. It is evidently written by a lady who has rather more than her fair share of common sense and good judgment, and moreover had the additional advantage of extended experience. Mrs. Babcock of course furnishes a number of culinary receipts, but her advice takes, a wide range, and embraces all the various phases of housekeeping, including the management of children.‚Äù The Belles- Lettres club The Belles-Lettres Club was the first to conduct (with financial success) a course of lectures in Oil City, Pennsylvania, and was one of the first in Pennsylvania to join the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The motto of the General Federation, 'Unity in Diversity,' was the prevalent spirit of the club. Babcock, widely known for her literary and executive abilities, was the president from the start.

Generally, the term \\"Savoyard Army\\" is used for the period when the rulers of Savoy held only the title of Duke, while \\"Sardinian Army\\" is preferred for the period after they obtained the title of King of Sardinia in 1720.  History   Origins  Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy was the major reformer of the Savoyard Army in the 16th century The Savoyard Army was officially established in the 15th century, when the Duchy of Savoy was created. During this period, the army of the Savoyard lands was concentrated at bases in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, where it was maintained by the local feudal lords who in exchange for the command of some regiments, maintained them for state service and stationed them on the land in the meantime. It was Duke Emmanuel Philibert who was largely responsible for the radical reforms of the army which made it a stable component of the state and disconnected it from the local feudatories at the same time. As part of this, he created the \\"peasant militia\\" on 5 July 1566. With this, the command of the army officially passed into the hands of the Duke of Savoy. Since there were no limits on age or length of service, many soldiers remained in service for a very long time, which had a deleterious impact on the army. There was little or nothing in the way of training and the resulting force left a lot to be desired on campaign.  17th and 18th centuries  In the seventeenth century, the Piedmontese army underwent notable reforms. The cause of these substantial changes was the foreign policy undertaken by the Savoyard government and new internal conditions. During the first half of the seventeenth century, the Savoyard army was not a solid force, but varied significantly in periods of peace and war and was essentially composed of regiments recruited from the nobility in the pay of the Duke, regiments of mercenaries, and Protestant regiments (mostly consisting of French Hugenots). In 1664, \\"proprietary\\" regiments of the Duke were first created, which bore the Duke's coat of arms as a flag rather than the arms of their individual commanders. Seven years later, in 1671, the army was also given a uniform, which was light grey for almost all units, much like that which had recently been adopted by the French Royal Army, which the Ducal army had frequently encountered (as opponents and allies) in the frequent wars of the era. In this period, the Piedmontese army was very open to innovations and was constantly modernising, especially during the reign of Victor Amadeus II. The two most important reforms of these years were probably the creation of a specialised group of grenadiers and the abolition of the pikemen, both of which took place in 1685. The second of these reforms in particular anticipated the motion of travel throughout Europe ‚Äì in fact the French and the Spanish only abolished their pikemen some fifteen years later, while the Swedes still had a third of their infantry equipped with pikes in 1720. Also important, somewhat later, was the Regulation of 1709, which was inspired by the discipline of the Prussian army observed during the Siege of Turin and by the firing tactics of the English and Dutch forces. Thus, fire of platoons in serried ranks was adopted instead of files in open ranks. The difference was that when firing in files, the soldiers were deployed in four or more files separated by four metres and all the soldiers in one file fired at the same time, with a set interval between the fire of each file, making a more constant fire possible. However, with the fire in platoons, the soldiers were separated into three close files and their front was divided into platoons, in each of which the soldiers of the three files fired at the same time, followed by the other platoons at a regular interval. This system remained the standard for all units throughout the first half of the 18th century. Throughout the century, there was a general tendency to the expansion of the army. In 1691, it contained 12 regiments of infantry, 3 of dragoons and 2 of cavalry; in 1747, it exceeded 32 regiments of infantry, but the cavalry continued to be formed of 2 regiments, while the dragoons had expanded to 5 regiments. With respect to numbers, we know that in 1774, the total number of Savoyard troops reached 100,000 individuals. In that year a regulation was introduced concerning the length of permanent military service. The king maintained control of the troops, supported by a defense staff, composed of adjutants and 28 experienced generals, all of aristocratic origin (nobles held 78% of the positions in the officer ranks), while in the various ranks of the infantry and cavalry forces, the bourgeois formed 20%. The rest of the army was manned by the proletariat.  Nineteenth century  Victor Emmanuel I established the Royal Carabinieri in 1814 After the Armistice of Cherasco in 1796 and the failure of the Kingdom of Sardinia's attempt to prevent the Napoleonic invasion, the Sardinian Army was gradually demobilised and was converted into the forces of the Subalpine Republic and then of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. After the restoration of the kingdom in 1815, Victor Emmanuel I ordered the reconstruction of the Piedmontese army, organised in ten brigades of infantry and supported by cavalry and artillery. These were divided into two large armies, each of which contained two divisions and a reserve division. Under Victor Emmanuel II, the Royal Sardinian Army was changed in many respects, with an increase in numbers and in the quality of the forces. In 1858, before the outbreak of the Second Italian War of Independence, a new military code was introduced by the king, which regularised the period of military service, establishing it as five years of active service then 6 years in reserve, up to the age of thirty, with 50 days of obligatory training and instruction per year. The active service was divided into two kinds: ordinanza and provinciale. The first included service in the Royal carabinieri, the armourers, the musicians, the musketeers, and the volunteers, while the second consisted of all the other soldiers and were obliged to remain in the army for 8 years unless the government ordered otherwise. In this reform, criminals condemned to forced labour, imprisonment, and exile were excluded from military service, as were those guilty of crimes relating to the penal code, men condemned by foreign courts to similar punishments, and the executors of justice, including judges, magistrates, their children, their adjutants and the children of their adjutants. The Piedmontese army in this period had a total force of 79,000 men (roughly 22,000 of which were officers and 56,000 were regular troops), in addition to around 20,000 officers and soldiers in non-Piedmontese volunteer forces, like the Hunters of the Alps. The volunteers in the regular army amounted to around 20,000 men. The conscripts were chosen by lot and could escape by making a payment or substituting a relative. Division took place on the basis of age and the oldest soldiers (provided they were literate) were made corporals. From these the sergeants were chosen on the basis of merit. After the unification of Italy the army became the Royal Italian Army.  Organisation  In the early nineteenth century, the soldiers of the Sardinian army had the following social composition: 65% farmers, 25% labourers and artisans, 10% bourgeois and aristocrats. Only 20% were literate and a mere 5% had received secondary education. In the regiments there was a school for the soldiers in which they could learn to read, write, and keep accounts. According to the regulations of 1853, the pay of the average soldier in peacetime was 15 centesimi, rising to 25 in wartime, in addition to a ration of bread, 830g of wood in summer and 1660g in winter (double for junior officers), and a daily subsidy for the wives of the soldiers and two rations of bread per day.  Infantry  Battle of Novara, 1849 Group of Bersaglieri, the special troops of the Sardinian army during the Risorgimento Infantry were the backbone of the Sardinian army and were subdivided into different types: National Service Infantry, Light legion, infantry for external security, provincial infantry, legions of the encampments, French corps, and the territorial militia. ;National Service Infantry :consisted of unmounted personnel (fusiliers and grenadiers) recruited from the territories of the Duchy of Savoy and were easily employed in the territory. In peacetime, it contained around 20,000 individuals, but in times of war it could increase to 50,000 men. ;Royal Light Legion :was a special force established in 1774 as borderguards in order to prevent smuggling and protect the borders. The personnel were mostly foreigners or at least not linked with the territory in which they were stationed, in order to prevent favoritism in their dealings with the local populations. The maximum total number of men serving in this corps was 2,100. When the Royal Sardinian Army became the Royal Italian Army, this corps became the modern Guardia di Finanza. ;Foreign Service Infantry :consisted of volunteers from the regions and states bordering the Savoyard domains (i.e. France, Switzerland, Protestants, Germany, Sicily, Lombardy). The total number of men was around 1,270. ;Provincial Infantry :was established at the beginning of the seventeenth century, with a fixed period of service of 20 years and non-professional personnel. The fixed period was reduced to 18 years in special cases for Savoyards and to 12 years for Ni√ßards. In 1792, the contingent contained 20,774 men. ;French Corps :were a type of corps shared with several other armies in the 18th century, including the Prussian and Imperial and took their name from the name of the commander who maintained them for the state. ;Territorial Militia :was the corps of volunteers recruited from the local area who served predominantly in mountainous regions, especially the Alps, and kept watch over small villages and settlements in rough and flat areas. The corps also carried out scouting and surveying duties for the regular army. To improve the quality of the operations of the infantry, there was a training system in Piedmont with training camps, modelled on the armed forces of France and Germany. The most important of these training camps was located in Briga Alta and was commanded by a General Inspector.  Cavalry The Sardinian cavalry, particularly noted for its valour in battle, was entirely of Savoyard extraction. The force which distinguished itself in the War of the Spanish Succession had 2,420 horsemen at its disposal in peacetime, but could rapidly double its numbers in times of war. The Sardinian cavalry included 3 corps of bodyguards to the sovereign (120 in peacetime and 260 during wars) and 6 regular regiments, including the famous \\"Piemonte Reale Cavalleria\\" and \\"Savoia Cavalleria\\" which were retained during the Kingdom of Italy and then also in the Republic. On 19 March 1852, a general reorganisation of the cavalry came into force which led to the following arrangement: * 4x regiments of dragoons: \\"Nizza Cavalleria\\", \\"Piemonte Reale Cavalleria\\", \\"Savoia Cavalleria\\", \\"Genova Cavalleria\\" * 5x regiments of chevau-l√©gers: \\"Cavalleggeri di Novara\\", \\"Cavalleggeri di Novara\\", \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\", \\"Cavalleggeri di Monferrato\\", \\"Cavalleggeri di Alessandria\\" * 1x squadron of guides: Squadrone \\"Guide\\" Every regiment had a general staff, 4‚Äì6 active squadrons and 1 reserve squadron. Each squadron contained 5 officers, 6 junior officers, 2 trumpeters, 2 blacksmiths, 1 saddler, 130 soldiers and 100 horses.  Artillery  The Sardinian artillery was very similar to that of the French, organised in brigades each of which contained 4/6 pieces moved by 300 horses and assembled on site by soldiers. The artillery was divided into field and mountain artillery, as well as siege artillery (mortars and howitzers). A large amount of the artillery personnel were recruited from Biella, which was also where the industry that produced the artillery was located. In battle, five pieces of artillery were assigned to each infantry brigade and four pieces for each cavalry brigade.  Specialists  The regiment of military engineers was based at Casale Monferrato and consisted of two battalions, each containing 5 companies, which each contained: 4 officers, 6 junior officers, 2 trumpters, and 88 men. The companies were assigned in various arrangements to the divisions and were given various tasks, including the construction of telegraph links. Civilian companies also came to be involved in the work of these engineers.  Armament  The infantry were armed with bayonet rifles and a dagger secured to the body with a leather strap, as well as a bandolier for the rifle. The officers did not have firearms; they only carried melee weapons. New models of rifle were adopted in 1844, with a first attempt at using percussion rifles. However, the transition from the firearms which used fire strikers to more modern weapons that fired using an \\"Eggs\\" capsule was completed only in 1859. All rifles were equipped with bayonets with the Laukart attachment system, which meant that they could be clipped onto the rifle without obstructing fire. The musket developed in parallel with this. The first nineteenth century models appear in 1833 and they were modified in 1844 to make them more like actual infantry rifles, except shorter and more manageable on account of their lighter weight. The carbine was mainly given to sharpshooters, but was also the distinctive weapon of the carabinieri. The Sardinian army was first equipped with pistols in 1847 (although some were already in use from 1844). These included the large cavalry pistol which was considered a weapon of last resort as an unsatisfactory compromise between a pistol and a musket. The pistol and cavalry pistol bullets were spherical and hollow with a diameter of 16.6 mm and an explosive payload of 2.5 g. From the eighteenth century, the cavalry were armed with carbines which were very accurate over short distances. The horses were mostly bay-coloured animals imported from German and they served for 4‚Äì6 years. A sixth were female. In the nineteenth century, the carabinieri were introduced and they formed main cavalry force, especially distinguishing themselves in the First Italian War of Independence with their splendid saber charges. The dragoons were equipped very differently ‚Äì with long bayonetted rifles (although they retained the use of the sabre as traditional). The typical artillery cannon of the Sardinian army was the mod.704 rearload saker, which was regularly used until 1848. The heavy artillery was characterised by long cannons (8-16-32 pound culverins).  Officers   Junior officers  The junior officers were drawn largely from the ordinary soldiers on the basis of merit and ability. Some of them were trained in various regimental schools, while others were sent to specialist schools for their particular branch. The junior officers who came into the army by desertion from the Austrian army (largely during the first and second Italian wars of independence) were given the same rank they had had in the Austrian army, while older soldiers who deserted from the Austrians were promoted to junior officer class.  Officers  The law regulating the officers was approved on 25 May 1852 by Victor Emmanuel II. As for the junior officers, officers deserting from the Austrian army were given the same rank that they had previously held. The promotion structure was as follows: * Sub- lieutenants: 1/3 drawn from junior officers and 2/3 from the military academies. * Lieutenants: In peacetime by seniority; in wartime 1/3 were free appointments. * Captains: In peacetime 1/3 were by free choice; in wartime 1/2 were. * Majors: In peacetime 1/2 were by free choice; in wartime all of them were. * Lieutenant-Colonel and above: In peace and war, all were free appointments.

Established in 1918 as the Nizhny Novgorod Infantry Courses, it became an infantry school in 1921 and was converted into a tank school in 1932, training tank commanders for the expanding Soviet armored forces. It relocated to Kharkov in 1938 and was evacuated to Chirchiq in September 1941 following Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II. The school was renamed the Tashkent Higher Tank Command School in 1966. Despite its name, the school was located in Chirchiq rather than Tashkent. In 1993, following the independence of Uzbekistan and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was renamed the Chirchiq Higher Tank Command and Engineering School.  History   Origins  The school traces its origins to the creation of the Nizhny Novgorod Infantry Courses of the Red Army command staff on 16 November 1918 during the Russian Civil War. The courses were taught in the building of the city's former eparchal school. Among the first cadets were workers from the city's Krasnoye Sormovo Factory. The faculty were taken from experienced former Imperial Russian Army officers, known as Military specialists. Ippolit Zhilinsky taught tactics, B.N. Moravsky engineering, and K.I. Bussov shooting. The first head of the courses was former Colonel A.I. Goryachev, and the first head of training was Nikolay Pukhov. During the summer of 1919, the first group of cadets graduated and were sent into combat on the Southern Front. In 1921, the courses became the 11th Nizhny Novgorod Infantry School and the training period at the school expanded to three years. On 15 March 1932, the school was renamed the Nizhny Novgorod Tank School named for I.V. Stalin, and began training tank commanders for the Red Army's new armored forces. The 1st Tank Battalion, a training unit, was formed at the school, commanded by Makar Teryokhin. It became the Gorky Tank School that year when the city was renamed. In the fall of 1934 the first class of tank commanders graduated; they included Georgy Skleznyov, who was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions in the Spanish Civil War, and future Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergey Sokolov. In March 1938 it was relocated to Kharkov and renamed the Kharkov Tank School named for I.V. Stalin. The school was subsequently renamed the 1st Kharkov Tank School named for I.V. Stalin after a second tank school was established in Kharkov.  World War II  Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, 252 lieutenants graduated from the school and immediately sent to the front. In July, a consolidated cadet shock tank battalion under the command of a Major Grishin was formed from a selection of the remaining cadets and commanders, equipped with new T-34 and KV tanks fresh from factories in Kharkov, and sent to the front within three days. In September, as the front line approached Kharkov, the entire group of cadets and instructors from the school took up defensive positions at the stanitsa of Buryn and the khutor of Mikhailovsky, fighting alongside the Kharkov Infantry School. On 22 September the school was evacuated to Chirchiq, where it was renamed the Tashkent Tank School. Two months later, it graduated another class of tank commanders. During the war, the school's training period was accelerated. In 1943, for \\"outstanding services in training command cadres\\", the school was awarded the Order of Lenin. During World War II, the school graduated more than 7,000 tank commanders. For their actions, 74 graduates of the school became Heroes of the Soviet Union during the war.  Postwar  The school began transitioning back to a two-year period of study in 1946, and from 1949 had a three-year training period. In December 1961, as part of De-Stalinization, the school's honorific \\"named for I.V. Stalin\\" was replaced by \\"named for P.S. Rybalko\\" in honor of Soviet armor commander Pavel Rybalko. In April 1966, its training period was extended to four years, and the school was renamed the Tashkent Higher Tank Command School. Graduates now received a higher education diploma and a civilian engineer specialty. In 1993, following the independence of Uzbekistan, the school was renamed the Chirchiq Higher Tank Command and Engineering School. From 1997, the school trained tank platoon commanders in the operation and repair of armored vehicles and equipment, airborne platoon commanders in the operation and repair of armored and motor vehicles, and tactical short-range anti-aircraft systems commanders in radio engineering, as well as engineers for the operation and repair of armored vehicles and equipment, and political officers in social sciences.

The estate was created in the 1670s but the current main building was built after a fire in 1916. History 1782‚Äì1761:Vind and Benzon Gjeddesdal was created In 1672 by Holger Vind. It replaced the village of P√•rup. Vind named the estate after his wife Margrethe Gjedde. She became the owner after his death in 1683. She died in 1706 and the heirs then sold it to Niels Benzon. His son Lars Benzon inherited it in 1708 but sold it to his brother Peder Benzon in 1814. Peder Benzon significantly increased the size of the estate, for instance by closing down all the farms in the village of Torslundelille. In 1730, he divided it in two by creating the name manor of Benzonsdal from almost half of the land. When it was sold in auction after Peder Benzon's death in 1735, Lars Benzon bought it back but sold it to their brother Jacob Benzon in 1740. He owned it until his death in 1761. 1761‚Äì1822: Von Kl√∏cker, Wulff Gj√∏e and Barfoed Benzon's heirs sold the estate to Herman Lengerken von Kl√∏cker by his heirs. He created a so-called from the estate with the effect that it could no longer be sold, mortgaged or divided between heirs but it was dissolved shortly thereafter. In 1774, his widow, Caroline von Hoppe, sold the estate to Michael Wulff G√∏ye. G√∏ye was interested in the enlightenment philosophy of the time and for the living conditions of the farmers on his land. G√∏ye died in 1795. In his will, he granted the tenant farmers the right to buy their farms at prices determined in the will. He also decided that part of the money from a sale of Gjeddesdal should be used for the creation of a grant. Tune Landbyskole was founded after the turn of the century G√∏ye's heirs sold Gjeddesdal to Jens Laurids Barfred in 1797. Most of the farms were sold to the farmers at prices determined by G√∏ye in his will. Jens Laurids Barfred bought up more land in the area. In 1819, he created a new farm, Barfredsh√∏j, with the southern part of the estate. It was, however. difficult times for Danish agriculture. Faced with bankruptcy, Barfred had to sell first Barfredsh√∏j and then Gjeddesdal. 1822‚Äì1927: Valentiner family Heinrich Christian Valentiner The new owner was Heinrich Christian Valentiner. He was originally from Holstein but had purchased Bredeshave at Pr√¶st√∏ the previous year. He improved the soil and introduced new farming methods. He also established his own slaughterhouse on the farm, salting the meat and exporting it to France and the Netherlands. From 1828 he also kept dairy cattle and opened a dairy on the farm shortly before his death. Gjeddesdal painted by Ferdinand Richardt, c. 1860 His son, Adolph Valentiner, inherited the estate in 1831. He renovated the main building and drained the land systematically as the first landowner in the country. After Adolph Valentiner's death in 1868, Gheddesdal was passed on first to his son Heinrich Nicolai Valentiner and then to his grandson Adolph Herman Valentiner. The old main building was destroyed in a fire in 1196 and a new one was built in its place. 1927‚Äìpresent: Nymann family In 1927, Adolph Herman Valentiner sold Gjeddesdal to Martin Nymann.

The continent is the birthplace of several of these organized sports, such as basketball, gridiron football (including both American and Canadian games), ice hockey, lacrosse, racquetball, rodeo, ultimate, and volleyball. The modern versions of baseball and softball, skateboarding, snowboarding, stock car racing, and surfing also developed in North America. Sports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of expansion teams or relocations of existing teams. Leagues in other North American countries use promotion and relegation systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season. The major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), the National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). Liga MX, the top-level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular. In the Caribbean, where cricket is popular, that region's major domestic competitions include the Regional Four Day Competition, the Regional Super50, and the Caribbean Premier League. Women's professional sports in the U.S. and Canada include the Women's National Basketball Association, the National Women's Soccer League, and the National Women's Hockey League. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include INDYCAR and NASCAR in auto racing, the PGA Tour and the LPGA Tour in golf, and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). College athletics in Canada are organized by U Sports and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada A distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of promotion and relegation systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed season. Other North American countries, such as the Mexico's football league system, may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level Liga MX and the second level Ascenso MX. Instead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of expansion teams and relocation of existing teams, and with no team movement between the top level, the major leagues, and the lower levels, the minor leagues. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on individual players rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under- performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team. College athletics act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many college sports in the U.S. are primarily organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: Division I for large schools, Division II for smaller schools, and Division III for schools who do not offer any athletic scholarship to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by U Sports for universities and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association for colleges. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada. Team sports Football North America is the birthplace of gridiron football, the form of football that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada. Both major forms, American football and Canadian football, developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as rugby football and association football. Gridiron football is distinguished by the forward pass, the system of downs, a line of scrimmage, measurements in yards, players wearing hard plastic helmets and shoulder pads, more specialist positions and formations, among others. Walter Camp, known as the \\"Father of American Football\\", is credited with creating the system of downs and line of scrimmage rules in the 1880s that originally differentiate gridiron football from its older counterparts. Canada would later implement similar rules when the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules in 1903. Association football is the most popular sport in almost all North, Central American and Caribbean Countries.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North,_Central_American_and_Caribbean_nations_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup Unqualified, football is generally understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. For example, \\"football\\" unqualified primarily refers to American football in the U.S., Canadian football in Canada, and association football in Mexico. The word soccer is instead used to refer to association football in the U.S. and Canada. =American football= The National Football League (NFL) is the highest professional level of American football in the world, with teams across the United States. College football in the U.S. is primarily organized by the NCAA. The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship Subdivision. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason bowl games. USA Football is the governing body for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations. Several other North American counties are a part of IFAF Americas, the federation of IFAF members in the Americas. In Mexico, the Liga de F√∫tbol Americano Profesional is the professional league, while ONEFA organizes college football. =Canadian football= The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the highest professional level of Canadian football, with teams across Canada. Teams from Canadian universities compete in U Sports football. The Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League field teams with players aged 18‚Äì22. Football Canada is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football. =Association football= CONCACAF is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the Gold Cup and the Champions League The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the men's national teams to determine the regional champion of North America. The Champions League is an annual continental competition for the top football clubs in North America, with the winner advancing to the FIFA Club World Cup. Liga MX is North America's most popular association football league with an average attendance of 25,557 during the 2014‚Äì15 season. It forms the top level of the Mexican men's, four-level league system, with Ascenso MX, Segunda Divisi√≥n de M√©xico, and Tercera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico. This Mexican league system uses promotion and relegation, where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the Super Liga Femenil de F√∫tbol is at the top level. The men's professional soccer league systems in both the U.S. and Canada instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. Major League Soccer (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the USL Championship. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The Canadian Soccer Association, the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: League1 Ontario and Premi√®re Ligue de soccer du Qu√©bec, as well as a separate level-one league, the Canadian Premier League. The United States has the USL League One and National Independent Soccer Association, which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the National Women's Soccer League is at the top level, and United Women's Soccer and Women's Premier Soccer League are at the second level. College soccer is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional. Other countries with multi-level professional league systems include Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Panama. Most of these use promotion and regulation. Baseball Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries. In the U.S. and Canada, Major League Baseball (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while Minor League Baseball (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB. MiLB also has teams and component leagues in Mexico (such as the Mexican Baseball League) and the Dominican Republic (such as the Dominican Summer League). The relationship between MLB and MilB is also the closed, franchise model, which has the same teams playing, and where the players are transferred between levels. Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, college baseball plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players. Other professional leagues in North America include the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Liga Mexicana del Pac√≠fico in Mexico, the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, the Panamanian Professional Baseball League, and the Liga de B√©isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente in Puerto Rico. The Cuban National Series is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba. It forms part of the Cuban baseball league system, run by the Baseball Federation of Cuba, the governing body of baseball in that country. Amateur baseball in Canada includes Ligue de Baseball √âlite du Qu√©bec, the New Brunswick Senior Baseball League, and the Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League. Amateur baseball in the United States consists of various organizations. Basketball Canadian Dr. James Naismith is credited with creating the game of basketball in 1891. While working as a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S., he primarily created the game as a way to could keep his gym class active indoors on a rainy day. The sport quickly spread throughout the U.S. and Canada, with Naismith becoming instrumental in establishing college basketball. Today, the National Basketball Association (NBA), with teams in the U.S. and one in Canada, is widely considered to be the highest level of professional basketball in the world, and NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. The NBA operates a minor league basketball organization, the NBA Development League, to help develop players. However, like the relationship between college football and the NFL, college basketball acts as the primary suppliers of players to the NBA. The Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, is the top professional basketball league in Mexico, while Liga Nacional de Baloncesto is the top one in the Dominican Republic. The Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) has teams in Puerto Rico. The NBA also runs the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), with many teams having direct NBA counterparts and playing in the same arenas. Similarly, the Baloncesto Superior Nacional Femenino (BSNF) is the women's counterpart professional league to the BSN in Puerto Rico. Ice hockey Montreal, Canada, is recognized as the birthplace of organized contemporary ice hockey. On March 3, 1875, the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink. With teams in both Canada and the U.S., the National Hockey League (NHL) is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, The American Hockey League (AHL) then serves as the primary developmental minor league for the NHL, with the ECHL being at the third level. There are also a professional women's league: the National Women's Hockey League with teams in the Northeastern U.S.. Junior ice hockey is played in both countries by players between 16 and 21 years of age. In Canada, the highest level is known as Major Junior, and is governed by the Canadian Hockey League, which itself has three constituent leagues: the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and the Western Hockey League. The second level, Junior A is governed by the Canadian Junior Hockey League. The lower levels, Junior B and Junior C, are run by various other leagues. In the U.S, the top level is represented by the United States Hockey League, the second level is represented by the North American Hockey League, and then there are several leagues at the third level. Liga Mexicana √âlite is the top level league in Mexico, where ice hockey is not popular, but slowly growing. Cricket Cricket in the West Indies is the second most popular sport in the Caribbean after association football. Originally introduced to the West Indies by British colonists, the sport's popularity spread and became a major part of West Indian culture. Domestic competitions organised across the whole of the West Indies include the Regional Four Day Competition (First-class), the Regional Super50 (List A) and the Caribbean Premier League (Twenty20). A single governing body, the West Indies Cricket Board, organizes cricket in over a dozen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and dependencies. Conversely, Cricket in Canada is a minor sport, which is unusual among the former Dominions of the British Empire. Cricket Canada, the governing body of the sport in Canada, has organized several domestic inter-provincial cricket competitions such as the CIBC National Cricket League and the TJT National Cricket League. Cricket in the United States has not been historically popular in that country. First, it was instead baseball, another summertime bat and ball sport, that became a popular U.S. pastime. And secondly, when the International Cricket Council was formed in 1909 as cricket's international governing body, it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the U.S. from participating in the sport at the highest level. There have also been several attempts to form professional cricket leagues, but some like the American Premier League never got off the ground, and others like Pro Cricket only lasted for one year. However, the United States of America Cricket Association, the governing body of the sport in the U.S., helps organize amateur leagues across the country. Individual sports Boxing Boxing draws many athletes across North America. Boxing in Cuba remains popular, with about 19,000 boxers hailing from that country.Pettavino, Paula J. (2003) ‚ÄùBoxing‚Äù in Encyclopedia Of Cuba. Eds. Luis Martinez-Fernandez, D.H. Figueredo, Louis Perez, and luis Gonzalez. Volume 2. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. p. 536. It is also a major sport in Mexico, having produced over 179 professional world champions. Boxing in Canada has been practiced in that country since before the Canadian Confederation in 1867. As for the United States, it became the center of professional boxing in the early 20th century. The major world sanctioning bodies in boxing are based in North America: the International Boxing Federation (Springfield, New Jersey), the World Boxing Association (Panama City), the World Boxing Council (Mexico City), and the World Boxing Organization (San Juan, Puerto Rico). Horse racing A few North American countries hold their own Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing series. The Triple Crown in the United States consists of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. The Canadian Triple Crown has the Queen's Plate, the Prince of Wales Stakes, and the Breeders' Stakes. The Barbados Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing includes the Barbados Guineas, the Midsummer Creole Classic, and the Barbados Derby. All three races in the Mexican Triple Crown series are held at the Hip√≥dromo de las Am√©ricas in Mexico City. The Triple Crowns for both pacers and trotters are both held in the United States. The Breeders' Cup, the annual series of Grade I Thoroughbred horse races, has been held in both the United States and Canada. Golf Three of the four men's major golf championships are held in North America: the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship. Three of the five women's major golf championships are also played on the continent: the ANA Inspiration, the Women's PGA Championship, and the United States Women's Open Championship. The PGA Tour and the LPGA Tour are both headquartered in Florida. Motorsports Auto racing is also popular in North America. INDYCAR and NASCAR are both headquartered in the United States, with the Indianapolis 500 and the NASCAR Cup Series being their top competitions, respectively. Grands Prix in Formula One are held in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Tennis Tennis is popular in North America. Among the major events, the US Open, one of the four Grand Slam events, is held annually at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. The Women's Tennis Association, the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, is headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. Tennis Canada, the Central American & Caribbean Tennis Confederation, and the United States Tennis Association are the regional member organizations of the International Tennis Federation, and help organize various events in their respective areas of North America.

State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Wyoming was won by Republican Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, running with governor of Massachusetts and the future 30th president of the United States Calvin Coolidge, with 64.15 percent of the popular vote, against the Democratic 46th and 48th Governor of Ohio James M. Cox, running with the future Governor of New York and 32nd President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, with 31.86 percent of the popular vote. Like all of the Western United States, severe anger at President Woodrow Wilson's failure to maintain his promise to keep the United States out of World War I produced extreme hostility among the strongly isolationist population of remote Wyoming.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 461‚Äì462 In addition, by the beginning of 1920 skyrocketing inflation and Wilson's focus upon his proposed League of Nations at the expense of domestic policy had helped make the incumbent president very unpopularGoldberg, David Joseph; Discontented America: The United States in the 1920s, p. 44 ‚Äì besides which Wilson also had major health problems that had left First Lady Edith effectively running the nation. Political unrest seen in the Palmer Raids and the \\"Red Scare\\" further added to the unpopularity of the Democratic Party, since this global political turmoil produced considerable fear of alien revolutionaries invading the country.Leuchtenburg, William E.; The Perils of Prosperity, 1914-1932, p. 75 Demand in the West for exclusion of Asian immigrants became even stronger than it had been before.Vought, Hans P. ; The Bully Pulpit and the Melting Pot: American Presidents And The Immigrant, 1897-1933, p. 167 Another factor hurting the Democratic Party was the migration of many people from the traditionally Republican Upper Midwest into the state.

No polls were taken in the state, but a Republican success was universally assumed. Vote Like every Mountain state, Wyoming, which had voted strongly for Woodrow Wilson in 1916 ‚Äì turned very strongly against Cox, who was to lose the state by a two-to-one majority, after Charles Evans Hughes had lost the state by double digits in 1916. Harding carried every county in Wyoming with an absolute majority, and passed sixty percent in all but three.

The briefness of this timeline can be attributed to the fact that acceptance of asexuality as a sexual orientation and field of scientific research is still relatively new. Several of these events refer to historical essays and studies on sexual behaviour. While modern asexual discourse focuses on lack of sexual attraction, rather than celibacy or sexual abstinence, the research on human sexuality and sexual orientation has only recently started making said distinction. 19th century 1860s *1869: Karl-Maria Kertbeny, in the same pamphlets arguing against Prussian sodomy law where he coined the terms \\"homosexual\\" and \\"heterosexual\\", also used the word \\"monosexuals\\" to refer to people who only masturbate. 1890s *1896: German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld wrote the pamphlet Sappho und Sokrates, which mentions people without any sexual desire and links them to the concept of \\"anesthesia sexual\\". *1897: German sexual reformist Emma Trosse gave the first definition of asexuality in her work Ein Weib? Psychologisch-biographische: Studie √ºber eine Kontr√§rsexuelle (A woman? Psychological-biographical study of a contrary- sexual) under the term Sinnlichkeitslosigkeit (Asensuality) and counted herself as such, stating \\"Verfasser hat den Mut, sich zu jener Kategorie zu bekennen (Author has the courage to admit to this category).\\" 20th century 1940s‚Äì1950s *1948: The Kinsey Scale included the category \\"X\\" for males who reported no socio-sexual contacts or reactions; according to the research, 1.5% of adult male subjects fell into this category. *1953: The Kinsey Scale included the category \\"X\\" for females who reported no socio-sexual contacts or reactions; according to the research, 19% of female interviewees fell into this category. 1960s *1969: Anton Szandor LaVey in his book The Satanic Bible referenced asexuals and asexuality, stating that \\"Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires ‚Äì be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual\\". 1970s *1972: The Asexual Manifesto written by Lisa Orlando is published by the New York Radical Feminists and circulates within feminist circles. *1973: Activists at Barnard College were pictured to include \\"asexual\\" on a board advocating to \\"choose your own label\\" and had their picture featured in February/March 1973 edition of off our backs. The picture was intended to be released in the previous article which described asexuality to be \\"an orientation that regards a partner as nonessential to sex, and sex as nonessential to a satisfying relationship.\\" *1974: Singer and composer David Bowie discussed asexuality in Rolling Stone in the article \\"David Bowie in conversation on sexuality with William S. Burroughs. *1977: Myra Johnson wrote one of the first academic papers about asexuality as part of the book The Sexually Oppressed. She described \\"asexuality\\" as a complete lack of sexual desire, while those who do experience sexual desire but have no wish to satisfy it with others were labeled as \\"autoerotic\\". Johnson focused on the problems experiences by such women, who she felt were often ignored by the sexual revolution and feminist movements of the time. *1979: In a study published in Advances in the Study of Affect, Michael D. Storms reimagined the Kinsey Scale as a two-dimensional map which included asexuality, defined as exhibiting little to no homo-eroticism nor hetero-eroticism. This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners. 1980s *1983: The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. The study used a variant of Kinsey's model, and scored participants according to sexual behaviour and desire for it. *1989: American talk show host Sally Jesse Raphael interviewed Toby (alias of Jim Sinclair), a then self-described androgynous and nonsexual person. 1990s *1993: The book Boston Marriages: Romantic but Asexual Relationships Among Contemporary Lesbians by Esther D. Rothblum and Kathleen A. Brehony was released. *1994: Anthony Bogaert, conducted a study published in The Journal of Sex Research that concluded that 1 in 100 persons identified as asexual. *1997: Activist Jim Sinclair posted in their website the essay Personal Definitions of Sexuality, originally written in response to a class assignment in 1987, where they defined themself as asexual. *1997: Zoe O'Reilly published the article My life as an amoeba in the StarNet Dispatches webzine, a first- person exploration of asexuality that sparked responses through the late 90s and early 2000s by people who identified with it. 21st century 2000s *2001: David Jay founded the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), which became the most prolific and well-known of the various asexual communities that started to form since the advent of the World Wide Web and social media. *2002: New York passed the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act, which was the first, and is currently the only piece of legislation that mentions asexuality in the world. *2004: Psychologist Anthony F. Bogaert published \\"Asexuality: prevalence and associated factors in a national probability sample\\" in the Journal of Sex Research. According to this paper, 1% of a 1994 British probability sample indicated feeling no attraction for males nor females. *2004: The New Scientist dedicated an issue to asexuality in response to Bogaert's paper. *2004: Discovery dedicated an episode of The Sex Files to asexuality. *2005: A common symbol for the asexual community is a black ring worn on the middle finger of the right hand. The material and exact design of the ring are not important as long as it is primarily black. This symbol started on AVEN in 2005. *2005: Stephen Hillenburg revealed that SpongeBob SquarePants is asexual. *2006: In January, David Jay appeared on ABC's The View and later in March of that year, he appeared on MSNBC's Tucker program, hosted by Tucker Carlson.

Siege of Aachen, which lasted from late April or early May until October 1248, was part of the German civil war that began with Pope Gregory IX's proclamation of a crusade against the Emperor Frederick II in 1240. The city of Aachen, which was the traditional coronation site of German kings, supported Frederick II and refused to allow his rival, Count William II of Holland, to enter the city to be crowned. William and his supports besieged the city, forcing it to allow him in, where he was crowned German king. The main primary sources for the siege are the Royal Chronicle of Cologne, the Chronicle of the Monastery of Bloemhof and Matthew of Paris's History of the English. Background The crusade launched in 1240 was the second against Frederick II, a declared enemy of the church. The first crusade, also called the War of the Keys, lasted from 1228 until 1230, when Frederick and the papacy were reconciled and he was re-admitted to communion. In 1239, he was excommunicated a second time, and when he threatened to march on Rome Gregory IX proclaimed a crusade. In 1245, Pope Innocent IV declared Frederick deposed and the prince-electors loyal to the papacy elected Henry Raspe, the landgrave of Thuringia, as the new German king (to be crowned emperor at a later date by the pope). On 16 February 1247, Henry died and the electorsThe electors were Konrad von Hochstaden, archbishop of Cologne; Siegfried von Eppstein, archbishop of Mainz; Arnold von Isenburg, archbishop of Trier; Gerhard von Lippe, archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg; and Henry II, duke of Brabant. chose William of Holland as his successor on 3 October 1247. Siege When the city of Aachen refused to allow William's supporters in, they began to surround it to besiege it in late April or early May. William was at Kaiserswerth as late as May 1 and may not have taken part in the opening of the siege. The siege opened with a skirmish by one of the city gates that left sixteen attackers and one defender dead. William had arrived with a large army by May 7, and Cardinal Pietro Capocci, the papal legate, arrived in the middle of May. The chronicle of Bloemhof records that William's supporters who were present at the siege included the archbishop of Cologne and the bishop-elect of Li√®ge, John of Enghien, and Counts Otto II of Guelders and John I of Hainaut. Despite the presence of the counts and their retinues, the besieging force was not large enough to completely invest (surround) the city, leaving the defenders a means of supply and communication. In an effort to force the defenders into submission, the city was pounded by trebuchets. A large dam, high, was built to stop up the river Wurm, which flooded a third of the city. The preaching of the crusade had its effect in the summer, when the besiegers were joined by reinforcements from Brabant, Flanders and Artois. In the autumn, a West Frisian contingent arrived and encamped on the eastern side of the city, completing the investment. These Frisians, subjects of William as count of Holland, had taken vows to join the crusade of Louis IX to the Holy Land, but these had been commuted to allow them to join the crusade against Frederick II instead. With the arrival of the Frisians, Aachen was cut off from supplies. The besiegers continued to bombard the city day and night with mangonels and pedreros (stone-throwers), according to Matthew of Paris. On the bring of starvation, the citizens negotiated their surrender with their bishop, the archbishop of Cologne, on 18 October. The imperial bailiff of the city and the twelve noble citizens pledged obedience to Pope Innocent and King William and were not punished further. William entered the city on 19 October and was crowned on 1 November. Aftermath The siege of Aachen was not the first nor the last siege William had to lay in order to establish himself in Germany. He began at least fourteen separate sieges between 1247 and 1251. That of Aachen, however, was the largest military endeavour, requiring enough troops to surround the entire city, most of them kept in the field for six months. On 3 November, William as king confirmed the rights and freedoms of the West Frisians that had supposedly been granted by his predecessor, Charlemagne, almost 450 years earlier. Taking account of the help the Frisians had given him, he renewed and confirmed \\"all rights, liberties and privileges conceded to all Frisians by Emperor Charles the Great, our predecessor\\".

Dobie was born in Whangarei, New Zealand in 1887 to Herbert Boucher Dobbie. In 1911 she moved to London to study at the Slade School of Art, under Henry Tonks. During the First World War she volunteered for the Red Cross and was stationed in Malta and Codford, England. After the war she returned to live in New Zealand, exhibiting her work at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery. During this period she met Herbert Guthrie Smith and formed the connection that would lead to her providing the illustrations for his book Tutira: the story of a New Zealand sheep station. In 1926 she toured Africa where she met her future husband, Rene Vernon, an engineer in the French Army. They settled in Tunisia where Dobie continued to paint. She sent her artwork to be exhibited in the Empire Exhibition in 1937. She died in Tunisia in 1944. Her death was reported in New Zealand in the Auckland Star and Evening Post.

He was elected to the Legislature of Burma in British Burma from Buthidaung in 1947. After Burmese independence in 1948, the President of Burma Sao Shwe Thaik appointed Gaffar as one of the seven members of the Inquiry Commission of Arakan in 1949. Gaffar was elected to the Chamber of Nationalities from Akyab West constituency in 1952. He was elected from Maungdaw in 1956. He also served as Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Health in the government of Prime Minister U Nu. Gaffar was a member of the Rohingya community of Arakan, a state with the largest percentage of Indians in Burma.Robert H. Taylor (1987). The State in Burma. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers. pp. 126‚Äì127. . In 1949, Gaffar presented a memorandum to the Regional Autonomy Enquiry Commission describing Arakanese Indians as the \\"Rohingya\\", based on the colloquial terms Rohang and Rohan, the local Indian names of the region. Early life Gaffar was born in 1910 in the Rwanynotaung village of Buthidaung in Arakan Division, Burma Province, British India. His father was Ulah Meah. Gaffar attended the Chittagong Senior Madrasa in the Bengal Presidency, where he completed his secondary school studies in 1924. He completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Dacca in 1930 and a bachelor of education degree from Aligarh Muslim University in 1933. He served as a District Inspector of Schools (DIS) in Akyab from 1931 to 1942 and as a Township Officer (T.O) of Buthidaung from 1944 to 1945. Political career During the 1947 Burmese general election, Gaffar was elected to the Burmese constituent assembly as a representative of the Buthidaung constituency. On 4 January 1948, he took oath as a legislator of the Union of Burma. The first president of Burma appointed Gaffar as one of the seven members of the Inquiry Commission of Arakan in 1949. During the Burmese general election, 1951-52, he was elected to the Burmese upper house, the Chamber of Nationalities, as a representative of Akyab West. During the 1956 Burmese general election, he was elected to the chamber as a representative of Maungdaw and Buthidaung. The first prime minister of Burma appointed Gaffar as parliamentary secretary to oversee the Ministry of Health. Memorandum of Appeal On 20 November 1948, Gaffar presented a Memorandum of Appeal to the Principal Secretary of the Government of the Union of Burma asking for recognition of the Arakanese Indians as one of the \\"official nations\\" (ethnic groups) of Burma under the name Rohingya. The memorandum was published in the Guardian Daily, an English newspaper in Burma, on 20 August 1951.http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs14/Kei_Nemoto-Rohingya.pdf > We the Rohingyas of Arakan are a nation. We maintain and hold that Rohingyas > and Arakanese are the two principal nations in Arakan. We are a nation of > nearly 9 lakh, which is sufficient for the population of a nation; and what > is more is that we are a nation according to any definition of a nation, > with our own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, > art and architecture, names and nomenclature, sense of value and proportion, > legal laws and moral codes, customs and calendar, history and traditions, > aptitude and ambitions; in short, we have our distinctive outlook on life > and of life.

Political legacy Despite Gaffar's call for constitutional recognition of his community, and increased Rohingya political participation in the 1950s; the Indian minority in Arakan faced discrimination after the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat. The 1982 Burmese nationality law rendered the community stateless, by failing to recognize the Rohingya as one of Burma's \\"national races\\". Rohingyas are restricted from state education, government jobs and freedom of movement in Myanmar, with the conditions being described as similar to apartheid.

Around the world, he has painted murals, structures, benches, and trucks in the distinctive truck art style of Pakistan. He first gained international attention in 2002 when he worked on the first authentic Pakistani truck in North America for the Smithsonian and has since exhibited at museums and institutions globally. Early life and education Ali was born in Karachi, Pakistan to a family originally from Jalandhar in Punjab, which moved to Lahore and Karachi before partition. Ali received rigorous training in truck art as a child apprentice. He was trained from the age of eight by his truck artist father, Muhammad Sardar, who insisted on an ability to draw straight vertical and horizontal lines. By age 16, he had painted his first truck under master supervision. Ali founded for Phool Patti, an organization that promotes truck artists from Pakistan across the world. Phool Patti means \\"flowers and leaves\\" and is a term Pakistani artists working in the truck use to describe the art themselves. One of his aims is to train young artists to continue his legacy. He taught at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture as a visiting faculty member. Method and style On most projects, Ali blends his own set of visual vocabulary with imagery and motifs suggested by the client. In his Karachi workshop, he paints in the open air and sketches his ideas on the ground. If necessary, he has painted scenes that he has never personally seen, a task he enjoys. Ali will paint portraits of famous Pakistani political and cultural figures, which often appear on the rear of trucks. Upon request, he paints truck owner's children, a task he finds more challenging as the clients closely scrutinize the work. Ali appreciates the sentimental quality of truck art and believes that love is at the core of the art. According to Ali, truck art is to Pakistan what Bollywood is to India. Notable works As part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 2002, Ali painted a Bedford truck in Washington, DC. Jamal Uddin, another Pakistani artist, completed the body and metal work while Haider handled the painting. It is the only complete and authentic recreation of a Pakistani truck in North America and is noteworthy for conveying the totality of truck art, not reducing it to painting, metalwork, or other elements that are prized by elite art audiences. In 2011, Ali also painted a truck in Luton, United Kingdom for a special Truck Art exhibition at the Stockwood Discovery Centre. Now part of the Center's transport collection, the truck is only one of its kind in the U.K., and possibly Europe. Initiated as part of the festivities for London 2012, the project celebrated ties between Luton and Pakistan, as Bedford trucks manufactured in Luton in the 1950s are still used in Pakistan. Ali collaborated with 20 artists including Rory Coxhill, a British Gypsy artisan and folk wagon artist who apprenticed for eight weeks in Pakistan as part of the project. In 2013, Ali visited Kolkata, India and decorated a truck as part of the city's Durga Puja annual celebrations in honor of the goddess Durga. With the help of two assistants, Ali painted a pandal, or one of the colorful religious structures used for the event. The pandal structure was designed to give visitors the feeling of standing in the cargo hold of a truck while the head of the truck, or taj, was used to hold the representations of the goddess. The installation was accompanied by a truck art exhibition introducing visitors to the art. Ali understood his participation as supporting India - Pakistan coexistence and friendship. In 2014, as part of a fellowship at the USC Pacific Asia Museum, Ali painted a van as a gift to the university for their patronage. Ali included California references including the bear from the state of California flag bear, the Hollywood sign, a bald eagle, and ocean sunsets. His work was shown as part of the museum's exhibit, \\"From the Grand Trunk Road to Route 66,\\" which linked the culture of travel in the US and Pakistan and the explosion of vehicular-related art in the 1950s. Ali and his team painted a mural on the wall of the Karachi Press Club which features notable Pakistani women including Yasmeen Lari, Pakistan's first female architect and prominent activist Sabeen Mahmud. The work was commissioned as part of the I am Karachi campaign. It was the subject of local protests while it was being painted and later became a target of vandalism and graffiti. Ali restored the mural in 2017. Ali has also drawn the mural of the man allegedly killed by police officers, in racial terrorism, George Floyd in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

History  Walter Neilson was a farmer who owned land on the south west edge of Finedon, Northants, England. The land around Finedon has many rich, shallow ironstone deposits, and commercial extraction of iron ore began in the 1860s and was a booming industry by the 1870s. In 1879, Neilson began quarrying for ironstone on his land. By 1881, he was producing enough ore to justify laying a narrow gauge tramway from his land down to sidings on the Midland Railway about a mile north of Wellingborough railway station. These sidings became known as \\"Neilson's Sidings\\" and were still known by this name into the 1990s. Neilson's Tramway was laid to gauge and the lower section was a double-track incline powered by a stationary steam engine located at the bottom of the incline. The upper section of the tramway was horse-hauled into the quarries. Neilson's first quarry was exhausted by 1892, and he leased land on the east side of the Finedon Road (now the A510) at Thingdon, immediately south of Finedon. \\"Thingdon\\" is an earlier version of the name \\"Finedon\\". This required an extension to his tramway, that passed under the Finedon Road. By 1911, all the ore that could be extracted using opencast quarrying had been found. The ore deposit dipped beneath Neville's Lodge and required mining to access. Neilson was not prepared to undertake the more technically difficult mining process. Instead he sold his company to the Wellingborough Iron Company who opened up the Thingdon Mines to access the ore. Neilson's Tramway continued in occasional use under the ownership of the Wellingborough Iron Company until 1929. The track was not taken up until 1933.

Biography Tatiana Markus was born in the Shtetl of Romny to a large Jewish family. A few years after her birth, her family moved to Kiev. Markus graduated from the 9th form of school No. 44. In 1938, she worked as a secretary of the personnel department of the passenger service of the South-Western Railways. In the summer of 1940, she was sent to Kishinev, where she worked in a tramway trolleybus park. After the seizure of Kishinev by the Romanians Tatiana returned to Kiev, which was occupied by Germany in 1941. Since then, she began actively participating in underground activities. She repeatedly took part in sabotage acts against the Nazis, in particular, throwing a grenade at a line of marching soldiers disguised as a bouquet of asters. With fake documents, Markus was registered in a private house under the name of Marcousisse: a legend was invented that she was the daughter of a Georgian prince executed by the Bolsheviks. Under this name she was hired to work in an officer dining room. There, she successfully continued the sabotage activity: pouring poison into SS officer's food. Several officers died, and Tatiana left without suspicion. In addition, she personally shot a valuable Gestapo informant, and transmitted underground information about traitors who worked with the Gestapo. Many officers of the German army were attracted by her beauty and attempted to pursue her. One was a high-ranking official from Berlin, who was shot dead by Markus at his apartment after coming to fight partisans and underground fighters. During her tenure, she killed dozens of German soldiers and officers. Once she shot a Nazi officer and left a note: All of you, fascist reptiles are waiting for the same fate. Tetyana Markosidze. The leadership of the Soviet underground decided to withdraw Tatiana from the city to the partisans, but failed to do so. On August 22, 1942, she was captured by the Gestapo while attempting to cross the Dnieper. She was subjected to cruel torture in the Gestapo for five months, but she did not betray anyone. On January 29, 1943, Tatiana Markus was shot. Legacy * Memorial plaque at the Kiev school No. 44.

Biography Thomas Thacher was born in Milton Clevedon on 1 May 1620. He was carefully educated by his father, a minister at Salisbury, who prepared him for entrance to one of the English universities, but the son declined to subscribe to the religious tests that were then a condition of matriculation, and resolved on settling in New England. He reached Boston on 4 June 1635, and soon afterward entered the family of Reverend Charles Chauncy at Scituate, under whose guidance he studied mental philosophy and theology, and attained a remarkable knowledge of the Eastern languages. He was especially noted for the great beauty of his transcriptions of Syriac and other Eastern characters, and also acquired a knowledge of medicine, practicing occasionally with success. He married Elizabeth Partridge Kemp on 11 May 1643 and they had four children. She died on 2 June 1664, and he remarried to Margaret Webb Sheaffe. He was ordained at Weymouth on 2 January 1644, and shortly afterward took charge of the congregation of that village. Here he remained till 1664, when he removed to Boston, possibly because the relatives of his second wife resided there, although he is said to have been dismissed by his congregation in Weymouth a little before that time. He practiced as a physician in Boston for the next two years, but preached occasionally. On 16 February 1669, he was installed pastor of the Old South Church. He is mentioned in terms of high praise by Cotton Mather in the Magnalia, who quotes an elegy, written partly in Latin and partly in Greek by Eleazar, a Native American student at Harvard College, in which the virtues of Thacher are celebrated. He wrote A Brief Rule to Guide the Common People of New England how to order Themselves and Theirs in the Small Pocks or Measels, which is supposed to have been the first work on medicine that was published in Massachusetts (Boston, 1677 ; 2d ed., 1702), and A Fast of God's Chusing ; Fast Sermon (1674).

It is based on Ken Follett‚Äôs award-winning 1989 novel of the same name, which was adapted as a videogame across 21 playable chapters. Book 1 of the game was released on 16 August 2017,The Pillars of the Earth video game is out now Accessed 4 September 2017 Book 2 on 13 December 2017, and Book 3 on 29 March 2018. Gameplay The Pillars of the Earth follows the principles of a classic point-and-click adventure: the user controls one of three main characters as they travel across highly detailed backgrounds as the plot continues. The game is almost exclusively controlled by mouse. The player holds the left mouse button over objects or characters to bring up an interaction menu with \\"look\\", \\"talk\\", and \\"use\\" options. The player may hold the space bar to have the interactive portions of the world, such as objects, highlighted. This shows differently coloured indicators for objects, characters, and travel points. The game also features an inventory screen accessed by the right mouse button. Objects gathered from the world are stored in the character's backpack, which are then used in the world and/or combined with other items to solve puzzles and advance the story. In addition, the game includes minigames, where characters interact in real time with some element in their environment. In The Pillars of the Earth, primary in-game characters, based on those in the novel, include: Aliena, Cantor (voice acted by Ken Follett), Cuthbert, Earl Bartholomew, Jack, Martha, Philip, Richard, \\"Shovelmonk\\", Tom, Waleran, and William. There are only a few playable protagonists, namely Tom, and younger and older versions of Philip, Jack, and Aliena. Game characters visit or revisit in-game locations in the fictional earldom of Shiring, such as Kingsbridge, Shiring (town), Earlscastle, and St.-John-in-the-Forest, alongside historical locations such as Gloucester, Lincoln, Salisbury, and Winchester. Plot The game begins with the option of an interactive tutorial inside a cathedral. It then transitions to the Prologue which is set in Shiring in 1135. It is here in the snow-covered woods, near St-James-in-the-Forest, that Tom, his heavily pregnant wife Agnes, and their children, Alfred and Martha, stop to rest overnight. It ends with the death of Agnes in childbirth. Book 1: From the Ashes The game restarts near Kingsbridge Priory as it mourns the death of Prior James. Philip, surprised by the news, learns of the upcoming vote for the new prior. He accepts a nomination, and also agrees to help his brother, Francis, recover a missing letter. We then see the aftermath of the death of Agnes, the abandonment and rescue of the newborn child, and the uniting of Tom's family with Ellen's. We then follow Jack from Ellen's cave to Shiring and ultimately Earlscastle, where he helps Tom to find work. The main characters of Aliena and William Hamleigh are also introduced, and Philip delivers the letter to Bishop Waleran. In January 1136, he gains the priorship over Sub-prior Remegius with the support of Waleran. Also, at Waleran's instigation, the Hamleighs launch a surprise attack on Earlscastle. Philip and the monks then deal with the arrival of some 200 refugees from Earlscastle. Among them are Tom and his family group. Jack is again tasked with helping Tom to find work, and successfully destroys the old cathedral. Philip goes to Winchester to meet with Waleran, the Hamleighs, and Bishop Henry, all seeking the spoils of Shiring from King Stephen. With the Hamleighs, he uncovers evidence of Waleran's duplicity at the bishop's palace, and negotiates a separate agreement for building resources. The book ends with Philip and Tom discussing plans of the new cathedral, culminating in Tom's appointment as master builder. Jack then wanders around the building site where he meets and re- friends Aliena. Book 2: Sowing the Wind The game restarts with William and his manservant Walter holding Aliena and Richard prisoner at Earlscastle. William chafes while waiting for news from his father, and derides Aliena at every opportunity. Stealing Wiilliam's horse, they arrive in Winchester seeking their father. There they befriend the wife of a wool-merchant and swear oaths to their dying father. They then unsuccessfully seek their mother's sister. Aliena decides to buy some wool directly from a shepherd for resale, and is invited to Kingsbridge by Philip. The story then jumps to 1141 with Jack and Aliena now a couple, albeit secretly. Building the cathedral continues despite concerns about costs and troubles with the Hamleighs over resources. Evidence of the Hamleighs' harsh rule becomes evident as well. Aliena heads off to the Shiring marketplace, and with the proceeds she visits Richard to resupply him with funds. Philip, accompanied by Aliena, meets the new earl, William, who demands an end to the priory's market, as Waleran continues to scheme and plot. Philip accompanies Richard to Lincoln, in hopes of an appeal to the king. Stephen initially denies his request, but after losing the Battle of Lincoln, both are captured. After William switches sides, Stephen decides to approve a fleece fair and market at Kingsbridge. In revenge, William raids the market and Aliena loses her livelihood again. Jack becomes a novice and Aliena informs him that she will marry Alfred. Jack then leaves to search for traces of his father in France. Aliena finds herself pregnant with Jack's child and leaves to search for him, and Alfred goes to Shiring to work on a rival cathedral. Book 3: Eye of the Storm The game picks up with a flashback scene of the White Ship disaster, then jumps to July 1142 as Aliena arrives in Normandy. In Tours, she finds evidence of Jack, then takes the Camino de Santiago. Meanwhile, Jack has befriended a Muslim merchant in Toledo, and Aliena traces him to Saint Denis, where they marry. The family return to Cherbourg, where he is recognised by his father's mother. Next, Philip reluctantly welcomes Jack's moneymaking statue as a means to fund the rebuilding program. Philip, Jack, Aliena, and Richard then travel to Shiring to warn Waleran and William against interfering in the renovations at Kingsbridge. The story moves forward 11 years to 1154 when England suffers from a prolonged drought and famine. After a crack appears, Jack finds Prior James' hidden chamber under the cathedral and the chalice his father was accused of stealing, but reveals his complicity in the cathedral fire. Meanwhile, after nearly 15 years, the civil war ends and Aliena befriends Elizabeth Hamleigh during a storm. Philip's book, written in the interim, causes controversy as outlaws, led by 'The Butcher', begin to organise in the quarry. Aliena infiltrates Earlscastle in hopes of ousting William, and stabs him as Richard and the outlaws attack. Walter then assists the transition of power. Waleran, meanwhile, arrests Philip, and at the trial before Bishop Henry in the cathedral, all the various plot lines of the game are drawn together through Prior Remegius. Waleran is arrested and Philip undergoes trial by fire. In the Epilogue, 20 years later, Philip and Waleran meet one last time. Development The basic game concept for The Pillars of the Earth began in May 2014, when Cologne-based publishing company Bastei L√ºbbe acquired a majority interest in Hamburg-based video game developer and publisher Daedalic Entertainment to expand its portfolio.Die S√§ulen der Erde Accessed 25 August 2017 At the Frankfurt Book Fair 2014, Daedalic CEO Carsten Fichtelmann suggested to Ken Follett a conversion of his novel.Die S√§ulen der Erde: Gronkh erh√§lt eine Sprecherrolle Accessed 25 August 2017 The game, whose German book publishing rights are held by Bastei L√ºbbe, was then announced around the same time. The game follows in the genre of similar point and click adventures released by the same company, such as The Whispered World, A New Beginning, and Deponia. Described as \\"A thousand-page novel, adapted as a videogame across 21 chapters\\",New game based on ‚ÄúThe Pillars of the Earth‚Äù begins this summer Accessed 4 September 2017 the game is set in three parts. Book 1 was released in mid-August 2017 on Steam, and Book 2 in mid-December.Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth ‚Äì Book 2 and 3 Release Schedule Accessed 5 September 2017 A GOG release of Book 2 was also in December, and PS4 and Xbox One editions were available in January 2018. Book 3: Eye on the Storm was released at the end of March 2018. Like others in the genre, the game is made using the Visionaire Studio engine, and features a 2D scrolling viewport with parallax layers. Visually, the game includes over 200 hand-painted backgrounds over which animated sprites interact. The soundtrack was produced by Tilo Alpermann. The score was recorded in Prague by FILMhaormnic Orchestra, while medieval choral elements were recorded in Berlin-Pankow's . It is available in eleven languages: Chinese (simplified and traditional), Danish, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, and Spanish. Voice actors recorded nearly 40 hours of voice-overs, including Ken Follett who also added his voice to the game. Reception Domestic International The Pillars of the Earth has received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Blake Hester from GameSpot praised the game's characters, unique visuals, and story development, but critiqued it also for a lack of drama or tangible tension, \\"snail-paced\\" narrative, and slow frame- rates (on Xbox One) and loading times.

All but three of the stories were originally published in The New Age edited by A. R. Orage; the first to appear was \\"The Child-Who-Was-Tired\\". The last three were first published in this collection, and Alpers thinks that two (The Swing of the Pendulum and The Blaze) were probably rejected by Orage for The New Age. The collection was originally published in December 1911 by Stephen Swift & Co Ltd; the imprint of Charles Granville the publisher of Rhythm. The first impression of probably 500 copies was followed by two more impressions of 500 copies in January and in May or June 1912. In early October 1912 Granville absconded to Algiers, and his firm was liquidated. A story that copies for America went down with the Titanic in April 1912 is probably not true. Mansfield refused permission for a reprint of the collection in 1920, both as they were juvenilia and they could contribute to post-war jingoism. In 1926 after her death her husband John Middleton Murry reprinted them. Alpers says that Mansfield is famous for just two books .... an earlier one being happily forgotten; the two books being Bliss and Other Stories and The Garden Party. The stories were written after her stay in Bad W√∂rishofen, a German spa town, in 1909, where she was taken by her mother after her disastrous marriage, pregnancy and miscarriage. Some reflect on the habits and demeanour of Germans, and some refer to the exploitation and repression of women by men. \\"A Birthday\\" has a man, based on her father Harold Beauchamp, waiting for his wife to give birth; he mutters Everything here's filthy, the whole place might be down with the plague .. The setting is identifiable as turn-of-the-century Thorndon when it was an unhealthy hole from the mid-1880s because of poor sewage rather than the setting for grand residences and society balls as in her later stories.

She had been beaten over the head with a blunt instrument, later found to be an empty liquor bottle, and evidence of male DNA was present at the crime scene. The last time she was known for certain to be alive was much earlier that morning, when she went to bed after returning from a local nightclub with her roommate. Police have recovered considerable forensic evidence in the case, but so far it has served to eliminate one likely suspect, a former boyfriend of her roommate who reportedly expressed anger and resentment toward Hedgepeth, even supposedly threatening to kill her if he could not reunite with her roommate. His DNA, however, did not match that left at the scene. A note left at the scene, suggesting the writer was jealous, is also believed to have been written by the killer; it was among a large group of documents released by police two years after the crime, following a court action brought by several local media outlets. Four years after the killing, a Virginia DNA testing company prepared and released, at police's behest, an image showing what the suspect might look like based on his genetic phenotype. A voicemail possibly accidentally recorded by Hedgepeth may also capture some of the events that led to her death. The Chapel Hill police continue to investigate. Background A member of the Haliwa-Saponi Native American tribe recognized by the state of North Carolina, Faith Hedgepeth was born in 1992 in Warren County, part of the tribe's traditional territory. Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her second daughter Faith because she believed that was what she needed to raise a fourth child when she already had two sons and a daughter with a husband with a drug problem. In high school, Hedgepeth was an honor student, a cheerleader and a member of many extracurricular clubs and organizations. She did well enough academically to earn a Gates Millennium Scholarship to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her father had attended UNCCH as well, but had dropped out. She hoped to be the first in her family to graduate from college. After undergraduate studies, she was considering further studies to become either a pediatrician or teacher. Her first two years at the university went well for her, although she took the spring 2012 semester off. She remained in the Chapel Hill area over the summer, living in an off-campus apartment at the Hawthorne at the View complex between Chapel Hill and Durham, on the line between Durham and Orange counties, during the month of August. She planned to move to another apartment after her financial aid for the fall semester was made available to her. She shared the apartment with Karena Rosario, with whom she had been friends since freshman year, and Rosario's boyfriend, Eriq Takoy Jones. The relationship between Jones and Rosario had been marked by domestic violence, and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted to break into the apartment, even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth eventually drove Rosario to court to get a protective order that required Jones to stay away from the apartment. Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her if he could not get back together with Rosario. Homicide The evening of September 6, 2012, a Thursday, began at 5:45 p.m. with Hedgepeth attending a rush event for the campus chapter of Alpha Pi Omega, a historically Native American sorority she hoped to join. At 7:15 she left, saying she had to work on a paper she was writing about the history of her tribe. She and Rosario went to the university's Davis Library to study together at 8 p.m. Between 8:30 and 9 she exchanged texts with her father about her hopes to join the sorority. Hedgepeth left Rosario there briefly and returned around 11:30, after which they returned to their apartment together, arriving there around midnight. A half-hour later they left again, heading for The Thrill, a now-closed nightclub in downtown Chapel Hill which admitted customers under the legal drinking age of 21 to dance. The two young women arrived at The Thrill around 12:40 a.m. After almost an hour and a half of dancing, Rosario told police later that she was having an upset stomach and wanted to leave. Security cameras at the club show her and Hedgepeth leaving at 2:06 a.m.; it is the last visual record of her presence anywhere before the killing. By 3 a.m. Hedgepeth and Rosario had returned to their apartment. A woman who lived below the two and was awake watching television said that she heard three thumping noises, which she described as similar to a heavy bag being dropped or furniture being overturned, shortly afterward. Hedgepeth's Facebook page was also accessed around the same time. At 3:40 a.m., a text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to that of Brandon Edwards, a former boyfriend of hers, saying \\"Hey b. Can you come over here please. Rosario needs you more aha. You know. Please let her know you care.\\" Three minutes later, another text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to Edwards' with the single word \\"than,\\" believed to be a correction for the \\"aha\\" in the previous text. That was the last evidence of activity from her phone. At 4:16 a.m., Edwards sent a return text asking who had sent the previous text. Rosario's phone records show she was also trying to call Edwards around the same time. He did not answer, and when he did not she tried to call Jordan McCrary, a UNCCH soccer player she knew. At 4:25 a.m., she left the apartment to get in McCrary's car. At that time, Rosario said later, she believed Hedgepeth was asleep in her room, and left the apartment's door unlocked. McCrary drove Rosario to the home of another acquaintance on West Longview Street in Chapel Hill. She put the time of her arrival there at around 4:30 a.m. After spending the rest of the night and the early morning there, a short time after 10:30 she began trying to arrange a ride home. After attempting to reach Hedgepeth, who did not answer, Rosario instead called another friend, Marisol Rangel, who came and took her back to her apartment. When they arrived there, shortly before 11 a.m., they entered and called for Hedgepeth, who did not respond. In her bedroom, they found her bloodied body, wrapped in a quilt, partially nude. They immediately dialed 9-1-1 and informed police. Investigation Details of the investigation were not discussed publicly at first, a deviation from the Chapel Hill police's usual practice. The town obtained a court order sealing all records as they were collected. Police collected semen from the scene and used it to develop a DNA profile; it reportedly was consistent with male DNA found elsewhere in the apartment. The autopsy determined that Hedgepeth had died from blunt force trauma to the head, likely a result of being hit by an empty rum bottle in the apartment. Jones seemed to be a very strong suspect from the beginning. Police learned of his history of domestic violence and his threat against Hedgepeth. They also found that the night before, around 6 p.m., he had texted an acquaintance asking for forgiveness \\"for what I am about to do\\" and then posted the same message on his Twitter feed. Three days later, he changed the banner on his Facebook page to read \\"Dear Lord, Forgive me for all of my sins and the sins I may commit today. Protect me from the girls who don't deserve me and the ones who wish me dead today.\\" Police sought a DNA sample from Jones, whom they considered a person of interest. After some initial resistance, he complied. His DNA did not match the sample from the apartment, and they excluded him as a suspect. DNA from Edwards and many other men whom police found had been at The Thrill during the same time as Rosario and Hedgepeth was also tested, with the same result. Within days the university's board of trustees, the local Crime Stoppers chapter, the Haliwa-Saponi tribe, and the apartment complex had offered a combined $29,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest. Police hoped the reward money would lead to a quick resolution of the case, as their resources were limited. In the 2008 murder of Eve Carson, who at the time was UNCCH's undergraduate student body president, a $25,000 reward had led to the killers' arrest. Two months later, the office of governor Bev Perdue added another $10,000 to the reward for Hedgepeth's killer. Seal on case records In November, The Daily Tar Heel, UNCCH's student newspaper, petitioned the judge who had ordered the investigation records sealed to release an early search warrant in the case. Instead, the judge ordered it resealed for another 45 days. At that time, the Chapel Hill police had not even released Hedgepeth's cause of death, although her parents told the media that their daughter's death certificate said she had been beaten. Police announced in January that the DNA from the scene had come back as belonging to a male. From the crime scene and other evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had developed a profile of the man. They said it was likely that he had lived near Hedgepeth in the past, had expressed an interest in her and his behavior may have changed since the crime, including showing an unusual interest in the case. Notwithstanding this release of information, the town successfully petitioned the court to keep the warrants under seal, saying that phase of the investigation was still not complete; in May 2013 the court extended the seal another 60 days. In September 2013, a year after the killing, Chapel Hill police formally requested the assistance of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, which had provided some help earlier in the investigation, with the case. \\"We're working the case hard, and we've used all the possible resources,\\" said Chief Chris Blue. However, he would not share any more information about the case. Two months later, the Tar Heel noted that the Hedgepeth case remained open, along with the death case of David Shannon, a UNCCH freshman whose body had been found on the grounds of a Carrboro cement plant the previous October 27 (while he had died from a fall, the autopsy found he was severely intoxicated, and the Carrboro police suspected hazing and believed there might be other students who could tell them more about the circumstances of Shannon's death). In Hedgepeth's case, there had been no new information about a possible suspect since January. Yet the case records remained under court-ordered seal. In March 2014 the Tar Heel was joined by the Raleigh News & Observer and Capitol Broadcasting Company, which owns three television and radio stations in the Research Triangle area, in opposing the district attorney's motion to extend the seal another 60 days. They argued that the order was not justified by a compelling interest on the state's part, and that some of the orders had been issued before the records covered by them had been created, meaning the argument for sealing them was speculative. During a hearing on the motion, the district attorney filed a more specific accounting of what investigative work had been done, allowing the media to report for the first time on what police had searched in the immediate aftermath of the crime. \\"Eighteen months goes by and no one's been charged and no one's been arrested,\\" said a lawyer for the Tar Heel. \\"The public has the right to assume the trail has gone cold, or it's not being investigated in a diligent manner.\\" In response, the district attorney's office argued that releasing the detailed records at that point would definitely hinder the investigation, and the records remained under seal. =Criticism of seal= The following month, Chelsea Dulaney, a reporter who had originally covered the case at the Tar Heel, wrote an article on the Atavist platform taking a skeptical look at the sealing of the case. She speculated that the seal's real purpose was to conceal early missteps by the Chapel Hill police, who might also not have been competent enough to handle the investigation by themselves. The town's court filings, she noted, revealed that after the first two months of the investigation no new search warrants had been sought. \\"We have to ask, how hot is it?\\" asked one of the lawyers representing the media. Dulaney talked to the residents of the apartments at Hawthorne at the View who lived near Hedgepeth and Rosario. They told her that during the preceding summer, they strongly suspected the domestic violence later reported between Rosario and Jones; they thought the police presence on the day the body was found was related to that until they learned otherwise. Two of the neighbors told Dulaney that while the police sealed off the four- unit block where Hedgepeth and Rosario lived with crime scene tape, they only searched the women's apartment and not any of the others in it. Nor did they search the woods behind the apartments, and they only returned later to search one other apartment in the complex. They did not seem to canvass the area either, never knocking on doors and asking residents what they might have seen. The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments. When the State Bureau of Investigation officers began investigating the case late in 2013, they also interviewed residents of Hawthorne at the View. One resident who spoke to Dulaney said it was clear to her that the SBI investigators were better trained than their Chapel Hill counterparts had been. The agent who interviewed her asked questions that elicited more useful information from her, she recalled. In downtown Chapel Hill, Dulaney talked to the owner of a towing service who had the contract for the Thrill's parking lot. He had set up a system of security cameras to monitor activity in the club's parking lot that might have possibly recorded anything that happened outside of the club involving Hedgepeth and Rosario while they were there that morning, or after they left. The police did not ask to see it until shortly before Dulaney wrote the article, almost 19 months after the crime. By that time, he told her, any footage from that night had been long since recorded over. =Release of records= The court ordered the records unsealed in July 2014. Media organizations were able to review and report on the search warrant applications and the investigative notes that had supported them, with most names redacted, for not only the residences and cars but Hedgepeth's phone, computer, Facebook records and bank account. Also released was the transcript of Rosario's 9-1-1 call, and the content of the early-morning text messages as well as the timeline of Rosario and Hedgepeth's actions the night before the body was found. In September 2014, almost two years after Hedgepeth's death, the autopsy report was released. It confirmed what was on her death certificate, that she had died of blunt force trauma to the head. She had numerous cuts and bruises as well as blood under her fingernails, suggesting she had struggled with her killer. The DNA taken from the semen was matched to DNA elsewhere at the scene. Evidence The released records included the recording of Rosario's 9-1-1 call and two pieces of evidence that were seen as potentially helpful in narrowing down the killer's identity. The DNA profile was also used later to generate an image of the potential suspect. \\"Investigators have excellent evidence in this case,\\" Chief Blue said when the documents were released. \\"This is not a cold case. It has been and remains an active investigation.\\" 9-1-1 call News & Observer reporter Tom Gasparoli, who covered the case extensively for his newspaper, has also devoted most of his own blog to pondering the evidence and keeping the case alive. To him, Rosario's call raised many questions. \\"To me, the whole call reeks of unusual,\\" he wrote in 2017 on the case's fifth anniversary. Gasparoli raised the possibility that Rosario's friend Marisol Rangel, whose voice sounds to him more like the constantly sobbing caller, was the real caller, only later identifying herself as Rosario after repeated requests from the dispatcher for her name. And if it was Rosario, she never mentions that Rangel accompanied her to the apartment. The caller also does not mention Hedgepeth's name in a call that lasts nearly eight minutes, only describing the body she has come upon as \\"her friend.\\" And why, Gasparoli asked, does the caller seem reluctant to touch Hedgepeth's body despite repeated pleas from the dispatcher to at least see if she is still breathing? If Rosario was not able to bring herself to do so, could she not have asked Rangel to do so? \\"I have often thought,\\" Gaparoli wrote,\\"[that] if it was [Rosario], that she didn't call 9-1-1 the moment she first saw [Hedgepeth].\\" Note left at scene alt=A wrinkled piece of white paper with the words \\"I'm not stupid bitch jealous\\" scrawled on them in ballpoint pen Among the evidence collected was a note left near Hedgepeth's body with the text: It was sloppily written in ballpoint pen on what was determined to be the torn-off bottom of a white paper bag of the type commonly used for carry-out food. Police believe the bag may have come from Time-Out, a popular 24-hour restaurant in Chapel Hill that would have been the only place open at the time Hedgepeth and Rosario left The Thrill. It uses such bags and is a short distance away from the nightclub. Investigators have not said whether they have had the handwriting analyzed. The website Crime Watch Daily had an expert, Peggy Walla, look at photos of the note. She noted that it was clean of the blood reportedly found splattered all over the room, suggesting it was written either away from the crime scene or beforehand. The writer may have been using their non-dominant hand in an attempt to disguise their handwriting. Walla believes the writer was particularly agitated, likely to the point of homicidal rage, by being called \\"stupid.\\" In his post marking the fifth anniversary of the case, Gasparoli said a law enforcement source he talked to about the case refused to comment on whether the note was \\"odd\\" even as the source answered other questions. He elaborates that the words may have been intended to be read in a different order, producing wording that makes more sense (\\"I'm not jealous ... stupid bitch,\\" for instance). In addition, he theorizes that more than one writer may have been involved, or that not all of it may have been written at the same time. The word \\"STUPID\\" especially looks to Gasparoli as if it might have been written separately from the other words, as it is written much more clearly and off to the side. The swash extending leftward from the counter on the \\"P\\" in \\"STUPID\\" struck him as unusually distinctive. \\"[It] looks quite different, much more precise than any other letter in the note,\\" he says. It seems to Gasparoli to suggest a female writer, or at least one calmer and more intelligent than the lettering elsewhere on the note. Gasparoli questioned in fact what purpose would be served by leaving it there. As a message to Hedgepeth, it made no sense to leave it next to her body if she was dead; if it was written by the killer or killers, it could have been particularly incriminating evidence and they had to be aware of that possibility. It looked to him, in fact, \\"[a]lmost as if it were a red herring ... left for some other reason than to reflect the real feelings of the killer(s). Left ... to confuse.\\" Conversation accidentally recorded A friend of Hedgepeth's shared with police a long conversation, perhaps inadvertently recorded, when Hedgepeth's phone pocket-dialed them on the night before the murder, that may have some bearing on the case. It consisted of a three-way conversation, three minutes long, between what sounds to be Hedgepeth and a male and female, with music in the background. It was timestamped at 1:23 a.m., when the night's timeline has Hedgepeth at The Thrill. It was mostly inaudible and of minimal evidentiary value until Crime Watch Daily hired audio expert Arlo West, who specializes in enhancing such recordings. He claimed he heard Hedgepeth crying for help while the female says \\"I think she's dying\\" and the male says \\"Do it anyhow\\" after a long discussion in which the female seems to get angrier. The male and female use the name \\"Eriq\\" and \\"Rosie\\" (which is Rosario's nickname) respectively. Hedgepeth's father is convinced what was recorded was of his daughter's death; West agrees. The website informed the Chapel Hill police of West's findings, and they agreed to consider West's enhanced version and evaluate it. However, due to the time of the message, they do not believe it to be a recording of the killing; the music in the background further suggests it was recorded at The Thrill. Several months later, they added that the metadata associated with the call reinforces this belief. West, for his part, cites a known software issue with phones like Hedgepeth's that resulted in inaccurate timestamps. He discounts the background sound as being music, since his analysis did not produce any sounds like percussion, a heavy bass or synthesizers. Further, he adds, there are none of the background sounds, like glasses clinking and others talking, that one would associate with a nightclub. Image of suspect generated from DNA profile On a September 23, 2016, episode of the ABC News program 20/20, Chapel Hill police released an image generated by Parabon NanoLabs, a genetic testing company in Reston, Virginia, of what the suspect who left the semen might look like based purely on the phenotype in his DNA profile. Parabon's president told ABC that Snapshot, the program his company used to create the image, \\"predicts eye color, hair color, skin color, freckling, face morphology and ancestry.\\" The image included a chart listing the probability that the suspect had the traits he was assigned. According to the image, the suspect was \\"very strongly Native American and European mixed ancestry or Latino.\\" Most of his genetic markers pointed to Mexican, Colombian and Iberian ancestry, with some other South American and African countries making up the balance. Parabon believed with over 80% confidence that the suspect would have a skin tone in the olive range, with very few freckles or none at all and black hair. It did not make any predictions as to his height and weight. Theories Chapel Hill police have not named any suspects or even persons of interest in the case, but have stated that they do not believe the killing was a mere crime of opportunity by a stranger, that instead it was committed by someone in her social group, likely someone who knew her through UNCCH. They are certain the killer or killers knew Hedgepeth, and have interviewed 2,000 people, with DNA tests done on 750 of those. They have mapped the relations of many of those interviewees with Hedgepeth and each other, and have reportedly narrowed a pool of a thousand possible suspects down to ten. \\"This is not a cold case. It's never been a cold case,\\" Chief Blue told Gasparoli in 2016. A year later, Gasparoli said that he believed that the killer was \\"just outside\\" Hedgepeth's closest friends and acquaintances. \\"Good chance this person didn't know [Hedgepeth] or investigators would know who it was,\\" he wrote. They may, however, have been acting out of anger at some grievance she caused to someone closer to her. Blue declined to answer Gasparoli's question at that time as to whether investigators believed more than one person had been involved. \\"It's a piece of the puzzle we do not have if we connect the direct physical evidence,\\" Celisa Lehew, who took over the case as the department's new chief investigator in 2016, told the reporter regarding that theory. \\"There was some knowledge that two people lived there.\\" Speculation has sometimes focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, due to her 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting that \\"[Rosario] needs you more than you know,\\" the woman addressed as \\"Rosie\\" on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 the morning of the killing. Although she has left North Carolina and said very little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates. \\"They do believe there is more Rosario can tell them,\\" he says. \\"[It] sounds to me like [Rosario] has been in the crosshairs ... as a key figure who knows more than she says she knows.\\" See also *Deaths in September 2012 *List of 2012 murders in the United States *List of unsolved murders *Crime in North Carolina *Sexual victimization of native American women *2015 Chapel Hill shooting, three UNCCH/NCSU students killed in off- campus residence *Murder of Jane Britton, similar 1969 killing of a Harvard graduate student at her apartment, where police also kept information to themselves and perplexing evidence was found next to the body, attributed in 2018 to a long-dead man via DNA evidence.

It stars Gustavo S√°nchez Parra, Cassandra Ciangherotti, Fernando Becerril, Humberto Busto, Carmen Beato, Santiago Torres, and Maria Elena Olivares as people who are trapped by a hurricane at a bus station around the time of the Tlatelolco massacre in 1968. As the passengers wait for a bus to arrive, they are horrified to find that everyone's face is slowly transforming. The Similars premiered at Fantastic Fest in September 2015. It was released in Mexico in October 2016.  Plot  Ulises becomes frustrated when he is stuck in a bus depot during a massive storm while his wife gives birth in nearby Mexico City. The elderly clerk, Martin, tells him that the storm has temporarily stopped the bus service. Intermittent broadcasts on Martin's radio report increasingly worse news, eventually revealing that the storm is suspected to be a worldwide phenomenon of unknown origin. Ulises attempts to call the hospital with the station's payphone, only to be disconnected after a brief exchange that only worries him further. Ulises asks to use Martin's phone, but Martin says he does not have an outside line. Irene, a pregnant woman, takes shelter in the bus station. As she becomes flustered with Martin's disinterest in their plight, Ulises assists her and suggests she try to call for a taxi with the payphone. When she reports it is on the way, Ulises excitedly offers to share the fare with her. Ulises asks an older woman, Roberta, if she is also interested in sharing the fare, but she becomes agitated and responds in a language Ulises cannot understand. While they wait for the taxi, Irene goes to the restroom, where a cleaning woman, Rosa, surprises her and insists that she stay at the station. While Irene attempts to flee Rosa, Rosa has what appears to be an epileptic fit. At the same time, three more people arrive at the station: Alvaro, Gertrudis, and Gertrudis's son, Ignacio. Hearing Irene's calls for help, the others assist her. Martin, his face covered in bandages, comes out of his office with a rifle and blames everything on Ulises. Confused, Ulises says he is just a miner who is worried about his wife. As Martin continues to rant, Roberta suffers the same epileptic fit as Rosa. Alvaro and Ulises disarm Martin. As Ulises ties up Martin, Alvaro assists Roberta. Alvaro, a medical student, becomes concerned when he sees Gertrudis inject Ignacio with an hypodermic needle. She insists Ignacio needs regular doses to remain calm. After Alvaro excitedly recognizes Ignacio as a famous unsolved medical case, Ulises and Alvaro argue over their opposing political beliefs. All are stunned when Martin recovers and reveals that his face has morphed to look exactly like Ulises. Roberta, too, begins to show signs of facial hair similar to Ulises. Alvaro wrestles the rifle from Ulises and accuses him of being a government agent. Ulises insists he does not understand what the others are talking about, but they become panicked when Irene also transforms. Fearing that it is contagious, Alvaro attempts to leave the station, only to find the doors are both locked and bulletproof. Alvaro and Irene investigate Martin's office at his urging. They find that all the photographs, statues, and posters now have Ulises's face. Ignacio locks Gertrudis and Martin in a back room, where Rosa has transformed and committed suicide. Ignacio shows Ulises a comic book about aliens who, instead of conquering Earth, steal humanity's individuality. Once everyone has transformed, humanity's memory is wiped, and the humans once again perceive themselves as individuals, not knowing they have lost their individuality. When Gertrudis escapes, she explains that Ignacio has caused the comic book to come true. Ignacio reveals he was preventing them from leaving. When the others confront him, Ignacio uses his ability to change reality to stop them. As Ulises dies, he claims to not recognize the others' faces. In his wallet, they find a picture of Ulises, which they perceive as not looking like the bearded clone everyone else has transformed into; they surmise he was the first to transform. Irene dies during childbirth, and her baby has the cloned face. Ignacio collapses, and Roberta examines him. She says he made contact with the aliens and, not believing them to be real, mistakenly allowed them to control him. Gertrudis asks Roberta what to do next. Roberta replies, \\"Nothing.\\" Some time later, the police arrive and arrest Alvaro, blaming him for the deaths. Gertrudis and Ignacio leave for Tlatelolco, Mexico City. Narration announces that with few exceptions, Ignacio is the only one to remember or know what has happened, much like the comic book.

Like that show, he said he wanted to make a thriller that focused primarily on the characters. Ezban wrote the script in 2011, and shooting began on 7 July 2014 in Mexico City and Puebla. Ezban considered shooting in black and white but instead used desaturated colors. Besides The Twilight Zone, Ezban was inspired by The Box, which he said looks otherworldly because of its desaturated colors. The film is not overly political, but Ezban wanted to include references to the Tlatelolco massacre as a plot point to homage the socially conscious films of the 1960s while giving it a uniquely Mexican flavor.  Release  The Similars premiered at Fantastic Fest in September 2015. It was released in Mexico in October 2016.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 95% of 19 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.2/10. Dennis Harvey of Variety compared it to the 1961 Twilight Zone episode It's a Good Life, calling it \\"disappointingly familiar\\" but a \\"canny homage\\". Kim Newman of Screen Daily wrote, \\"Funny, suspenseful, inventive and charming, this knows when to tone down the homage and become genuinely frightening\\". Madeleine Koestner of Fangoria rated it 3/4 stars and wrote that the film \\"sells its silliness as scary, and by the end, you believe this ridiculous occurrence is really terrifying\\".

After Burmese independence, he was elected to the Parliament of Burma through a by election from Buthidaung in 1957. He was re-elected in 1960. He served as Minister of Health of the Union of Burma from 1960 till the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat. When Burma was considering becoming a federal state under Prime Minister U Nu's \\"unity in diversity\\" policies, Mahmud proposed that Arakanese Indians should either have a separate province covering the area between the Naf and Kaladan Rivers; or if a separate Arakan province is established with Arakanese Buddhists, it should have a confessionalist structure, with Muslims and Buddhists alternating as provincial governor. Early life Mahmud was born in Akyab in 1900. He was educated in Calcutta. Political career When Burma was a part of British India, Mahmud held the important post of cabinet secretary in the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi. During a by- election in 1957, Mahmud was elected to the Union Parliament from Buthidaung North constituency. He was appointed health minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister of Burma U Nu. Mahmud was re-elected during the 1960 Burmese general election. During his tenure as health minister, several hospitals were established in Arakan, including the Akyab General Hospital and Buthidaung Hospital. As an MP, Mahmud persuaded the education ministry to establish several schools, including the Shaheb Bazaar State Middle School and Minglagyi State Middle School. He also managed to create a scholarship program for Arakanese Indian students to study in Britain. Statehood question After winning in the 1960 general election, Prime Minister U Nu appointed an Inquiry Commission to study whether Arakan Division should be granted statehood. The commission found that most Arakanese Buddhists supported statehood, whereas most Arakanese Indians (Muslim majority) opposed statehood. Sultan Mahmud proposed that a state for Arakanese Indians be established in the northern part of Arakan, where Indians were a majority. Mahmud cited the Mughal Empire's expeditions up till the Kaladan River under Shaista Khan in 1666 as forming the basis of the boundary between Arakanese Muslims and Buddhists. The Kaladan River divided Muslim-majority and Buddhist-majority areas. Memorandum On 20 October 1960, Sultan Mahmud and his colleagues submitted a memorandum to the Statehood Consultative Committee. The memorandum laid down two conditions for statehood: 1) if the Arakanese Buddhists would support their demands; and 2) if the constitution of the proposed province would include adequate safeguards for Indian autonomy. The governor of the new state would alternate between Indians and Arakanese Buddhists. The proposal mentioned that if the governor of a state was a Muslim, then the Speaker of the State Council would have to be a non-Muslim, but his deputy, a Muslim; and vice versa. The same arrangement would apply to most other elected or appointed public bodies. The memorandum called for freedom of religion, including freedom to learn religious studies in educational institutions, according to personal beliefs. Arakanese Indians should be allowed to develop the Rohingya language and culture. The chief executive would have a designated officer to oversee the affairs of Arakanese Indians.

The Carson and Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company (C&TL;&F;) was formed to move lumber from trees growing along the shore of Lake Tahoe to the silver mines of the Comstock Lode. Between 1872 and 1898 C&TL;&F; transferred 750 million board foot of lumber logged from of virgin timberland. Origins Augustus Pray moved to Glenbrook, Nevada on the shore of Lake Tahoe in 1860. In 1863 he had two steam engines delivered. He used the first to build a sawmill at Glenbrook; and the second was used to power the paddle wheel tugboat Governor Blasdel built with some of the lumber he milled from nearby forests. The tugboat was then used to tow rafts of logs to his sawmill from more distant shores of Lake Tahoe. Lumber was in great demand on the opposite side of the ridge separating Lake Tahoe from the silver mines to the east. Aside from the need for homes to shelter the miners and associated commercial enterprises, the silver ore deposit required large quantities of lumber for a newly designed square set timbering structure to prevent collapse of weak rock overlying the ore body. The Truckee and propeller-driven Emerald began towing log rafts to Glenbrook in 1870. Duane Leroy Bliss formed C&TL;&F; in 1872 to build a narrow-gauge railway up the hill from the sawmill at Glenbrook to Spooner Summit, and to purchase the Marlette Lake Water System with a wooden flume to float the lumber from the summit dropping to the Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Carson City, Nevada. Lake Tahoe Railroad Lake Tahoe line in 1893 The V-shaped flume built by the Summit Fluming Company in 1869 was purchased first, and lumber moved uphill in wagons until the Lake Tahoe Railroad was built in 1875 to carry production from two more sawmills C&TL;&F; built at Glenbrook in 1873 and 1875. The route climbed following North Canyon Creek and required two switchbacks to reach the summit at an average grade of 2.44 percent with some as steep as 4 percent. Baldwin Locomotive Works built two 2-6-0 locomotives named Tahoe and Glenbrook. Either locomotive could pull six flatcars of lumber to the summit, and trains sometimes used twelve cars with one locomotive pulling and the other pushing. By 1877 the railroad had 75 flatcars; and a third similar locomotive was built that year to move the desired volume of lumber when one of the locomotives required repairs. Railroad and flume operations were coordinated by installation of one of the first telephone systems in the west between Glenbrook and Carson City. As additional log raft towing capacity was required, C&TL;&F; purchased the Meteor in 1876 the Emerald (II) in 1887. C&TL;&F;'s second Glendale sawmill burned in 1887; so their remaining Rigby sawmill shifted to 24-hour operation to sustain lumber production. Lake Valley Railroad Lake Valley RR route in 1893 In 1886 C&TL;&F; purchased George Chubbuck's Lake Valley Railroad south from Bijou, California up to Meyers, California. The railroad brought logs down to Lake Tahoe, where C&TL;&F; steamboats would tow them to the Glendale sawmills. The Lake Valley Railroad initially used square timbers as wooden rails for a primitive locomotive fabricated by Vulcan Iron Works of San Francisco. The locomotive was used as a stationary steam donkey after it destroyed the wooden rails; so Chubbuck laid conventional 35-pound rails and purchased the narrow-gauge 0-6-0 used for construction of the Nevada- California-Oregon Railway. C&TL;&F; sent one of their Lake Tahoe Railroad locomotives over to assist the Porter locomotive built in 1875 after they purchased the line. Both locomotives were sold to the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad when the Lake Valley Railroad was dismantled in 1898. Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company Demand for lumber declined as Comstock Lode ore depletion became evident. Bliss shifted his attention to building a steamboat landing at Tahoe City, California for his Tahoe Tavern resort. Bliss formed the Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company in 1895 to launch the 200-passenger Tahoe in 1896 and acquire the rebuilt passenger steamer Nevada. When transfer of lumber over the C&TL;&F; flume ended in 1898, the Lake Tahoe Railroad was dismantled and shipped across Lake Tahoe to be reassembled in 1899 as a tourist railroad connecting Tahoe City to the Southern Pacific Railroad at Truckee, California.

It was first reported on August 10, 2017 around 8:30pm after it was caused by a lightning storm. The fire encompassed . It nearly destroyed the historic Sperry Chalet. Start and early development Initially reported on August 10, 2017 on the north side of Sprague Creek, northeast of West Glacier, Montana, by August 15, 2017, the fire was estimated to be in size and situated in steep terrain. Burning along the Gunsight Trail, the primary trail access to the Sperry Chalet, a historic backcountry lodging facility only accessible by trail, the fire forced the closing of the chalet, though the structure was not threatened at that time. The Sperry Chalet was built in 1913 by workers employed by the Great Northern Railway and is listed as on the National Register of Historic Places. It was part of the Great Northern Railway Buildings that have been listed as a National Historic Landmark. By August 18 the fire had spread to on Mount Brown and firefighters had installed an irrigation system and hose lay in the Sperry Chalet area and wrapped the historic Mount Brown Fire Lookout tower with protective fire resistant material. By August 21, Sprague Fire had spread to encompass and was burning in a sparse vegetation zone on Lincoln Ridge. Nearly 100 firefighters had been assigned to the fire protecting structures such as Sperry Chalet with a portable pond and sprinklers and had the support of one helicopter performing water drops on hot spots. The fire assessment was that the sparse vegetation and somewhat cooler temperatures would help firefighters protect structures and that Sperry Chalet was not in imminent danger. By August 28, the fire has spread to over and firefighters continued to reduce fuel loads in potential burn areas and to protect and monitor conditions near Sperry Chalet. However, smoke was becoming a factor with hazardous smoke levels being recorded at the facilities in and near the Lake McDonald Lodge area. Sprinkler operations were also installed near footbridges on trails. Sprague Fire on August 18, 2017 On August 30, Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the concessionaire that manages many park lodges and food establishments throughout the U.S., decided to close the Lake McDonald Lodge and surrounding food and retail facilities for the season due to hazardous smoke conditions. This was done to protect the health of their employees as well as guests. Though the fire was from the lodge complex, heavy smoke had been settling in during the evenings and lingering into the mornings, reaching the \\"uppermost limit of hazardous\\". By August 31, the fire had spread to over but officials were confident that the highly trained firefighting personnel and fire mitigation strategies would continue to protect the structures of Sperry Chalet. A red flag warning had been posted for that day. Sperry Chalet on fire on August 31st Extreme fire conditions prevailed, with high winds and intensively dry conditions assisting the Sprague Fire in expansion to the north and east into heavy fuel zones of older growth forest and dead and dying wood. The fire doubled in size to more than . Firefighters fought fires nearing the Sperry Chalet and were assisted by four helicopters doing water drops, but the fire still managed to circumvent all efforts by the firefighters and gutted the main Sperry Chalet building. On Thursday, August 31, at around 6:10 PM, firefighters observed smoke originating from a roof eave and upon spraying water at the area, a window blew out and fire was seen coming out from inside the structure, indicating that fire had somehow worked its way inside the chalet. Firefighters attempted to put out the fire but were forced to abandon the effort, redirecting their resources instead to protecting other nearby structures. Fire consumed the roof and wood floors of the Sperry Chalet, leaving only the exterior stone walls still standing. After an environmental impact statement was completed, National Park Service authorities determined that the chalet would be rebuilt using the original stone exterior and aside from some minor modifications to meet current building codes, have all the same design as the original structure. The rebuilding process was expected to last during the summers of 2018 and 2019. September expansion Due to anticipated wind shifts from the southwest to the northeast for the night of September 3, the National Park Service issued a mandatory evacuation for much of the McDonald Valley region of the park. Fire behavior was expected to be severe and unpredictable and this, in conjunction with worsening air quality in the Lake McDonald region, led to the management decision for a mandatory evacuation. The evacuation area included public and privately held inholdings along the Going-to-the-Sun Road from the south end of Lake McDonald to Logan Pass, closing down all access to the pass from the west side of the park. As a precaution, an Interagency hotshot crew was installing sprinkler systems for Lake McDonald Lodge complex structures and historical items were being removed from the main lodge. Fire engines stationed at Lake McDonald Lodge involved in structural fire protection efforts on September 4, 2017. By the evening of September 4, the fire had spread to over and was only 35 percent contained. 155 firefighters were at work on the fire and overseen by a Type II Fire Management Team. The Sprague fire had burned substantial portions of the Snyder, Sprague and Lincoln Creek drainages. Heavy smoke interfered with further fire spread by September 5 and for the next several days no increase in acreage burned was reported. The smoke was greatly impacting air quality and grounded most helicopter flights. Spot fires were still reported in the area around Sperry Chalet and firefighters continued mop up operations there and were working on installing sprinkler systems for the Lake McDonald Lodge complex. On September 8 the acreage burned was estimated at and had not increased in several days due to very heavy smoke and haze dampening the spread of the fire. The Sprague Fire as well as the smaller Adair Peak Fire to the north near Logging Lake had essentially shut down most of the vehicular and trail access to the west side of the park. By September 9 a dry cold front helped to circulate some smoke out, improving visibility but also increasing the size of the fire that was listed at . A sprinkler system was set up at the Lake McDonald and Avalanche Creek areas in the hope that this would saturate those areas reducing the chances they would flare up should the fire spread in those directions. Smoke conditions on September 10 improved enough to allow two aerial tankers to drop a total of of water from Lake McDonald onto the fire. Some expansion of acreage burned was noted on September 11 to be due to increasing temperatures and winds, though the fire was being forced back into previously burned areas to some degree. A new red flag warning was issued due to the increased potential for fire growth. A wind shift ahead of an advancing cold front was anticipated to increase fire activity the evening of September 13. The fire was flanking the slopes of Mount Brown and heading towards the shores of Lake McDonald and while the fire was now considered to be 60 percent contained, structure protection at various locations was ongoing. Officials at Glacier National Park and with Flathead County, Montana issued an evacuation warning for Apgar Village at the southwestern end of Lake McDonald and portions of the adjacent community of West Glacier, Montana to residents to be prepared to evacuate should the approaching weather system cause a sudden spread of the Sprague Fire. By September 15 the fire exceeded and 167 firefighters were assigned to the fire. Much cooler temperatures were expected and light rain had commenced by the afternoon of September 14. Mount Brown Fire Lookout with fire resistant wrapping installed to help it withstand the fire The Sprague Fire continued to advance slowly towards the Going-to-the-Sun Road at the rate of approximately per day as reported on September 16 and a slight warming trend indicated the fire might continue to expand, albeit less rapidly than in preceding weeks. The precautionary fire evacuation warning that had been implemented for the Apgar region was therefore suspended . Light precipitation and much cooler than normal temperatures kept the Sprague Fire from expanding during the third week in September. Conditions had improved enough that officials lifted the outdoor fire burn restriction, allowing campers to once again burn campfires. By September 23, officials lifted the mandatory evacuation order for the Lake McDonald region but the Going-to-the-Sun Road remained closed to tourism due to ongoing fire activity. The fire was creeping and smoldering but no increase in burned acreage had been noticed during the third week in September. On September 28 the fire was determined by infrared flight to encompass . Slightly warming temperatures were expected for the last days of September, allowing the fire to possibly expand slightly. With the arrival of October, snow was expected throughout Glacier National Park, and the fire was deemed to no longer pose a threat to most structures, particularly those in the Lake McDonald complex, so firefighters busied themselves removing, \\"55,000 feet of hose, 24 Mark III pumps, 270 sprinklers and 6 portable water tanks\\". Visiting the fire on September 16, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke stated that rebuilding the Sperry Chalet would be a top priority and an engineering firm had already inspected the structure and was preparing a proposal on how to reinforce the remaining stone walls for the upcoming winter and other stabilization efforts. A fund for stabilization was established and was being overseen by the Glacier National Park Conservancy. The fundraiser exceeded the target goals in a matter of weeks. Work to brace the stone walls to prevent their collapse was scheduled to begin in October 2017, with supplies brought in by helicopter. Containment Sprague Fire continues to smolder on October 2, 2017 With the arrival of October, a combination of factors such as cooler temps, light snow and shorter days led to a vastly reduced fire threat and the Sprague Fire was 75 percent contained by the beginning of the month. Officials ceased providing regular updates due to the relaxed risk of further fire expansion and firefighters worked breaking down the water pumping operations set up in the Lake McDonald region that had supplied water for the sprinkler systems and return the equipment to regional fire caches. The fire was to be monitored by visual observation from roads and trails and with occasional aerial reconnaissance flights. The fire was anticipated to continue to produce smoke from smoldering logs and not to be fully out until lasting snows arrived later in the year. Full containment of the fire was not anticipated until November 1, 2017.

She has published two poetry collections since debuting in 2002. She was a visiting scholar at George Mason University, research professor at Korea University, post-doctoral researcher at Hanyang University, and is currently a research professor at the Wonkwang University Institute of Humanities. She is a member of the poetry group Inconvenience and the independent magazine Clearing Snow.  Life  Ha Jaeyoun was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1975.

She participated in the 2016 Seoul International Writers' Festival. Since 2016, she has been a member of Nunchiwoogi, a group of artists that publishes a crowdfunded poetry magazine.  Writing  Ha Jaeyoun's poetry reflects on familiar objects found in reality but manages to convey a new sensibility. Ha describes how people have grown accustomed to meaningless relationships and futile emotions in a society of dazzling spectacle. Without ever expressing intense emotion, she portrays the world she has internalized in a way that resonates with today's desensitized audience. The paradoxical nature of \\"familiar indifference\\" creates dynamism in her poetry and thus gives it a sense of new freedom. Ha's first poetry collection ' (ÎùºÎîîÏò§ Îç∞Ïù¥Ï¶à Radio Days) often uses everyday objects and experiences as subject matter, such as a cloud, bench, park, sunlight-filled window, TV screen, comic book shop around the corner, sleepy afternoon, and shabby neighborhood house with an iron gate. Such realistic subjects make her poetry highly accessible to readers. But when Ha describes her subjects, she also expresses doubt about her memory of them; the objects and phenomena portrayed in her work are constantly moving and changing. Her second poetry collection ' (ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏùò Î™®Îì† Ìï¥Î≥ÄÏ≤òÎüº Like All Beaches in the World) allows readers to visualize abstract spaces using images of dolls, ghosts, animals, and more. While Ha features numerous ordinary scenes and objects, she contemplates them with as little emotion as possible. Her dispassionate tone may be seen as an attempt to squarely face the sadness in the world.  Works  Poetry Collections 1\\\\. <ÎùºÎîîÏò§ Îç∞Ïù¥Ï¶à>, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥º ÏßÄÏÑ±, 2006 {Radio Days.

He taught philosophy, but devoted most of his energy to deepening the knowledge of the Viennese musician. His name is considered to be \\"inseparable from Mozart's.\\", even more than Alfred Einstein, Jean and Brigitte Massin.. These authors having dealt with other studies in Beethoven or Schubert for example, Jean-Victor Hocquard in about ten books, has invested himself entirely for Mozart. From his thesis, he maintained throughout his various studies, the idea that Mozart's specificity resides in a thought of \\"intrinsically musical character\\", going even went so far as to consider Mozart as an initiatory guide who, through aesthetic ideals, \\"would make his music a work of \\"truth\\"..

The film follows a mother who must protect her children after the mansion of her recently deceased father is invaded by burglars. Principal photography began in July 2017 in Southern California. The film was released in the United States on May 11, 2018. It grossed over $51 million and received mixed reviews, with critics praising Union's performance but describing the film as having \\"thinly sketched characters and a slapdash plot.\\" Plot After her father Isaac's murder, Shaun Russell travels with her two children, daughter Jasmine and son Glover, to the house where she grew up. Shaun intends to settle her father's estate and sell the remotely located house, which has multiple security features, including a hand-held remote monitor. When they arrive, the security system is offline, but Jasmine soon reactivates it. Unknown to the family, four offenders ‚Äì Peter, Sam, Duncan, and the crime boss Eddie ‚Äì were in the house before them, burglarizing it. Then Jasmine and Glover are taken hostage while Shaun is locked outside and narrowly escapes an ambush from Peter. Then another altercation sparks when Peter chases Shaun into the woods, where Peter gets knocked out by her. She leaves him bound and gagged, and uses the intercom to call the house. Eddie tells her they only came for the safe and the $4 million they know is inside; Isaac was under investigation by both the FBI and the DA and Sam had learned that he liquidated his assets. The offenders have only 90 minutes from when they sever the phone lines before the security company contacts authorities, so they want to find it and leave quickly. Concealed in the trees, Shaun sees Maggie, the realtor, arrive with paperwork for the house sale. Eddie greets her at the door, explaining Shaun had gone into town briefly, and attempts to invite her in. Maggie notices Shaun's purse on the table behind Eddie and knows something is wrong and politely declines. When Maggie turns her back on Eddie and leaves, Duncan ambushes her, and slits her throat, which outrages Eddie, as it means Shaun won't be as controllable. Shaun eventually finds her way into the house, and gives instructions to Jasmine. When Eddie and Duncan next threaten the children, Jasmine leads them to the safe, which Shaun believes only Peter knows how to open. Shaun returns with Peter, a knife at his throat, demanding her family's release. Eddie shoots Peter dead, and Shaun flees back to the woods. Peter had a flash drive containing computer code on a necklace, which is all they needed to crack the safe. With all the money in a bag, Eddie now intends to burn the house down with the children in it to cover their escape, which Sam is uncomfortable with. Then Shaun creates a distraction by playing music with the portable hand-held security remote. Duncan and Sam find Shaun on the roof during another rescue attempt. She hears a gunshot go off inside the house then jumps, pushing Sam off to his death, saving herself with the rope she tied to the roof. Then Shaun swipes Sam's truck keys sticking out of his pocket. Meanwhile, Jasmine frees herself and Glover, having cut through their bonds with a shard of glass from a broken lamp. The children escape the house and join their mother with Eddie in pursuit. Shaun uses Sam's truck to escape and mows down Duncan as they try to drive away, but Eddie blows out the truck tires, causing it to crash, foiling their escape. Shaun and the kids lock themselves in the house, thinking it's all over, until they discover the bag of money is still inside. Shaun's husband Justin arrives unexpectedly and Eddie attacks him which convinces Shaun to unlock the door. He finds Shaun with the money bag, doused in gasoline and holding a lighter. If he kills her the lighter will ignite the bag and he loses. He unloads his gun and Shaun lets him take the bag. However, Duncan appears and stabs Eddie to death. He goes after Shaun and threatens to rape her and Jasmine. Jasmine arrives to help her mom, but Duncan overpowers her. Shaun swipes Duncan's knife and stabs him dead. As police sirens and horns approach, Shaun goes outside to hold Justin and her kids close.

By 30 August, more than 41 million people were known to be affected by the floods, Ferand, Chloe INDEPENDENT: \\"At least 41 million people affected in floods in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, UN says\\", 30 August 2017. Accessed 12 September 2017. a figure that increased by 10% over the following three days, topping 45 million by 2 September. According to UNICEF, that figure includes 16 million children. About 2,000 people, on average, have died due to flooding in South Asia each year during the previous two decades, according to The New York Times reading of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (EM- DAT) disaster database.  Background and context  Monsoons hit South Asia every year between June and September, but the 2017 monsoon season has been far worse than average, bringing flooding, and associated landslides, of a scale unseen in recent years. Experts have called these the worst South Asian floods in decades, with long-term food supplies in question due to ruined farmland. As of 2 September, 1,288 people have been confirmed killed, and more than 45 million affected. The estimated number of people affected increased from 24 million to 41 million during the last week of August 2017. The International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCD) and others have asserted that these floods have been exacerbated by climate change.  Countries affected   Bangladesh  As of 1 September, flooding that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies called the worst in four decades covered approximately one-third of Bangladesh, primarily in the northern, north-eastern, and central parts of the country. At the height of the storms on 11 August, a week of regular monsoon rain fell in the span of a few hours. More rain and flooding was expected, including in Dhaka, the country's capital. Over six million have been affected, according to UNICEF, with estimates ranging as high as 8.5 million. Property losses included nearly 700,000 damaged or destroyed homes, of farmland inundated, and thousands of miles of damaged roads. The sheer amount of destroyed farmland, coming during the regular time of rice cultivation, has sparked fears of a food crisis in the country. Around 140 deaths from the floods were reported. Over fifty thousand people have been displaced, adding to nearly thirty thousand refugees fleeing the 2016‚Äì17 Northern Rakhine State clashes.  India  Helicopter deployed by Indian Air Force for rescue in flooded regions of Gujarat Flooding in India has been primarily confined to the northern portion of the country, including Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In the latter two, over 500 and over a hundred have died (respectively). By mid-August, flooding had affected over 31 million people, and damaged or destroyed over 800,000 houses. Over 85% of Kaziranga National Park was flooded. Government officials were criticized for not placing more preventative measures before these floods hit. In Bihar, for example, Reuters reported that there was anger at the number of embankments and roads which were designed with few to no provisions for water drainage. In Gujarat state, the floods and rains were reported to have caused 224 deaths in June and July months. Mumbai faces severe problems each year during the monsoon season because of its loose building restrictions and large homeless population, but this year's season saw the city receive more rainfall and worse flooding than the Maharashtra floods of 2005. One hospital was flooded, and the city's public transportation was forced to shut down. The weather also caused a century-old multi-story building to collapse, killing at least 33. On 29 August 2017, Mumbai was again witness to floods due to a confluence of torrential rains and high tide, resulting in 298 mm of rainfall in a period of 9 hours. 5 people are reported to have lost their lives in Mumbai due to the deluge which saw the highest rainfall in a single day in August since 1997. For the third consecutive year, monsoon season has been marked by flooding in the northwest and northeast regions, while drought in India worsens along the southern peninsula. According to an Indo-Asian News Service release issued in September, these \\"rainfall extremes have increased threefold over the last few years and now extend over all of central India -- from Gujarat to Odisha.\\"Indo-Asian News Service (IANS): \\"What's causing so many changes to India's Monsoons?\\" by Raghu Murtugudde, 3 September 2017.

Over 34,000 homes were flooded, destroying 1,000. Parts of the Mahendra Highway, the most important east‚Äìwest connection in the country, were washed away, and agricultural experts predicted that the country's rice production would be adversely affected. The runway of Biratnagar Airport was flooded and the airport was forced to close on 15 August. Experts stated that the flooding was the worst seen by Nepal in several years; about one-third of the country was flooded, much of it in the poorest areas of the country.

At least 23 people, including seven children, died after Karachi received up to of rainfall on 31 August. Most of the victims died from being electrocuted, with others being killed by partial building collapses or drowning. Two more died in Kashmore and Jamshoro districts of Sindh.

It cannot be observed directly. Rather, policy makers and economic researchers aim to estimate the natural rate of interest as a guide to monetary policy, usually using various economic models to help them do so.  History  Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk used the term \\"natural interest\\" in his Capital and Interest first written in 1880s, but the concept itself was originated by the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Wicksell published a study in 1898 defining the natural rate of interest as the rate that would bring an economy in aggregate price equilibrium if all lending were done without reference to money. Wicksell defined the natural rate of interest as \\"a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in respect to commodity prices and tends neither to raise nor to lower them\\".The study, published in German in 1898, became available in English in 1936. See Wicksell, K. Interest and Prices., Mises Institute website. Following Wicksell, J. M. Keynes introduced the term \\"natural rate of interest\\" in his A Treatise on Money (1930).The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes. Volume 5. P. 139. No further significant work on the idea of a natural rate of interest followed, partly because Wicksell's study was originally published in German and did not become easily available in English until 1936. Further, at the time, central banks were not targeting interest rates. The level of interest rates was not a main focus of policy attention. When during the 1990s the central bank policy targets started changing, the concept of natural rate of interest began attracting attention. The US Federal Reserve decision to adopt the short term interest rate as its primary control of inflation led to growing research interest into the topic of the natural rate of interest. Using macroeconomic models, the natural rate of interest can be defined as that rate of interest where the IS curve intersects with the potential output line (a vertical line cutting the X-axis at the value of potential GDP). Recent discussion A good deal of recent discussion about economic policy, both in the US and internationally, has centered on the idea of the natural rate of interest.\\"A natural long-term rate\\", The Economist, 26 October 2013. Retrieved 28 May 2018. Following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 (sometimes referred to as the \\"global financial crisis\\"), key central banks in major countries around the world expanded liquidity quickly and encouraged interest rates (especially short-term interest rates) to move to very low levels. This approach led to much discussion among economic policy makers as to what the appropriate levels of interest rates (both in the short-term, and in the long-term) might be. In 2017, for example, analysts in the Canadian central bank, the Bank of Canada, argued that the neutral rate of interest in Canada had declined significantly following the global financial crisis.Jose Dorich, Abeer Reza and Subrata Sarker, 'An Update on the Neutral Rate of Interest', Bank of Canada Review, Autumn 2017. R-star Among economic policy makers, in official and academic papers, the natural rate of interest is often depicted as r* (\\"r-star\\").Gavyn Davies, 'What investors should know about R star', The Financial Times, 12 September 2016. The president of the New York Fed, John Williams, has written extensively about the natural rate of interestPresident's speeches, Speeches by John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. and has even said, lightheartedly, that he \\"has a passion for r-star\\". R-star (the natural rate of interest) is of particular interest because key economic issues for economic policy makers, at any time, revolve around the relationship between current long-term interest rates and r-star. Questions arise, for example, as to whether current rates are below or above r-star, and if there is a significant gap between current rates and r-star, how quickly the gap should be closed. Broader issues also attract much debate, such as whether the global natural rate of interest (\\"global r-star\\") is stable or whether it is tending to drift up or down over time ‚Äì and if it is tending to drift, what are the underlying factors (economic, social, demographic) that are causing the change.John Williams, for example, refers to a \\"trio\\" of factors ‚Äì demographics, productivity growth, and the global demand for safe assets. Williams has argued that it is increasingly clear that global r* has declined in recent years:John C. Williams, 'When the facts change...'. Remarks at a High level conference in Zurich, 14 May 2019. > The evidence of a sizable decline in r-star across economies is compelling. > The weighted average of estimates for five major economic areas‚ÄîCanada, the > euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States‚Äîhas declined to > half a percent.

Given the demographic waves and sustained productivity growth > slowdown around the world, I see no reason to expect r-star to revert to > higher levels in the foreseeable future. ... The global decline in r-star > will continue to pose significant challenges for monetary policy. Other \\"star\\" variables Senior economic policy makers and other economists often discuss the level of the natural rate of interest (r-star) in relation to several other key economic variables, sometimes also seen as \\"stars\\". In August 2018, the Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve System (the \\"Fed\\"), Jay Powell, discussed the relationships between several of these main variables in some detail.Jerome H. Powell. 2018. \\"Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy\\", Jackson Hole Symposium, Wyoming, United States, 24 August. Powell noted that the natural rate of interest needed to be considered in relation to the \\"natural rate of unemployment\\" (which Powell noted is often referred to as \\"u-star\\", written u*) and the inflation objective (\\"pi-star\\", written Œ†*). Powell then went on to note that the conventional approach to economic policy making was that \\"policymakers should navigate by these stars\\". However, he said, although navigating by the stars can sound straightforward, in practice \\"guiding policy by the stars ... has been quite challenging of late because our best estimates of the location of the stars have been changing significantly\\". Powell reviewed the history of attempts to estimate the location of the \\"stars\\" over a 40-year period 1960‚Äì2000 and noted that over time, there had been significant revisions of estimates of the positions of the stars. Variations between countries Estimates of the natural rate of interest vary between countries. This is because the underlying factors influencing the natural rate of interest are believed to vary between countries. Estimates of the natural rate of interest in Australia carried out in 2017 in the Reserve Bank of Australia, for example, suggest that the natural rate of interest in Australia is perhaps somewhat higher than in the US/Euro area.Rachel McCririck and Daniel Rees, 'The Neutral Interest Rate', Bulletin, Reserve Bank of Australia, September quarter 2017.

Established in 1885 in Tilsit, East Prussia (present-day Sovetsk), the society was intermittently active until the outbreak of World War I. The society sought to preserve Lithuanian language and culture and protect them form Germanization. While it discussed linguistic and cultural subjects, the society never raised issues of social inequality or protested against the political regime of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The society prompted the division of Prussian Lithuanians into two main groups: religious conservative versus secular liberals. Birutƒó is best remembered for organizing festivals and celebrations that featured Lithuanian-language performances of various folk and patriotic songs as well as amateur theater performances, including the first Lithuanian-language theater performance in 1895. History Establishment and early activities The Lithuanian Literary Society was established in Tilsit in 1879, but it took more academic interest in Lithuanian language and culture. The society considered that the Lithuanian culture was dying due to Germanization and sought to record and study it but took no steps in keeping the language and culture alive. Thus Lithuanian activists began preparations for their own society. The issue was first raised by Georg Sauerwein in Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga in 1882. The idea was supported and further crystallized by Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Jonas ≈†li≈´pas, and others. They decided to establish a society that would study Lithuanian culture and heritage and that would actively promote it among the Lithuanians both in Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Major. They went as far as collecting membership applications and dues and scheduling the organizational meeting for 11 January 1894, but due to various difficulties, including financial hardship faced by Au≈°ra newspaper, such society was not established. Basanaviƒçius established the Lithuanian Scientific Society only in 1907. Instead, on 15 February 1885, four Prussian Lithuanians (Martynas Jankus, Jurgis Mik≈°as, Kristupas Voska, Ernestas Vejeris) established purely cultural society Birutƒó. At the time, they were its only members. The society was named after Grand Duchess Birutƒó (died in 1382) possibly as a result of a poem published in Au≈°ra. The name was later criticized for being too feminine and for not reflecting the identity of Prussian Lithuanians. The new society was attacked and criticized by the Germans for competing with the Lithuanian Literary Society and by religious Prussian Lithuanians for being too secular. The society held monthly meeting to discuss new books, share folklore, deliver presentations, debate on ways to stop Germanization. The meetings took place not only in Tilsit, but also in Memel (Klaipƒóda), Coadjuthen (Katyƒçiai), Kaukehmen (Jasnoje), Ragnit (Neman), Lasdehnen (Krasnoznamensk), Schmalleningken (Smalininkai). The number of attendees grew from a dozen to 300. However, the quality of presentations and discussions was limited by lack of education among Birutƒó's members, most of whom only had primary education. In one of the early meetings, Vilius Bruo≈æis, future chairman of the society, spoke for three hours trying to prove that the Lithuanian language was spoken in the Garden of Eden. The society considered and took tentative steps to establish Lithuanian-language schools, publish books (including a history of Lithuania that would incorporate the history of Lithuania Minor),Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 82 its own newspaper, or calendars, but those plans were not realized. The society considered but rejected the idea of taking over the publication of bankrupt Au≈°ra. Instead, it financially supported (15 marks per month) the short-lived newspaper Garsas published by Jankus. In 1888, the society officially dropped book publication from its goals and reduced the number of meetings to once a quarter. In total, between 1885 and 1888, the society held about 30 meetings. Revival in 1895‚Äì1899 The moribund society was revived in February 1895 for the celebration of its 10th anniversary. It organized a festival, attended by some 800 people, which included amateur theater performance of a play by Aleksandras Fromas-Gu≈æutis about the Siege of Kaunas in 1362. It was the first Lithuanian-language theater performance preceding the first performance in Lithuania Major by five years. The play was followed by living scenes which depicted a battle with the Teutonic Order and post-battle negotiations. Other performances included a concert by an orchestra of Prussian dragoons and seven singers from Tauragƒó (Lithuania Major). Among the songs performed was Lietuvininkai we are born by Georg Sauerwein to a melody of . Other songs included polka and mazurka by Vincas Kudirka, compositions by teacher , works by German and Italian composers. The festival was a success and it was decided to organize such events twice a year, in winter and in summer during the Saint Jonas' Festival. The same year, Birutƒó established its men's choir which first performed in February 1896. The society convinced Vyd≈´nas to direct it, but it soon disbanded. The last performance was in June 1897. Another Lithuanian choir was established at the and was also directed by Vyd≈´nas. This Lithuanian Choir of Tilsit was more successful and, at different times, was either a collaborator with or the main competitor of Birutƒó. Songs sung at Birutƒó's event were patriotic and often originated from Lithuania Major attracting criticism for being too radical. The festivals were organized not only in Tilsit, but also on Rambynas in 1896 and 1900Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 94 and in Memel (Klaipƒóda) in 1897. In 1899, the celebrations featured first plays by Vyd≈´nas staged by his choir members. Due to inappropriate behavior by Birutƒó members, the Lithuanian Choir refused further collaborations and the society's activities diminished. Rambynas, a sacred hill in the Lithuanian mythology, was a private property and therefore access to it was limited. Birutƒó bought a plot of land (11 morgens)Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 93 on the eastern part of the hill to provide public access, but it lacked funds to pay the purchase price and the plot was eventually transferred to . In 1899, an idea was raised to build a monument (a Lithuanian girl playing kanklƒós) on Rambynas dedicated to Kristijonas Donelaitis, Prussian Lithuanian poet and the author of the first Lithuanian-language poem. It seems that the idea originated from Birutƒó, though it was not realized.Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 95 Revival by Vanagaitis \\"Lithuanian Women at Rambynas\\", a postcard published by the society After a failed event in February 1901, the society became barely active and a liquidation meeting was called for December 1903. However, the meeting instead elected new chairman Jonas Vanagaitis who revived the organization. However, until 1908 the society was not very active as Vanagaitis and other members were more involved and focused on activities of the Lithuanian Union in Prussia (Lietuvinink≈≥ susivienijimas Pr≈´suose). In 1905, Birutƒó assisted the Lithuanian Literary Society with building the Lithuanian House in the Jakobsruh Park in Tilsit. In 1905, the society celebrated its 20th anniversary. The celebration included two plays written and staged by Vyd≈´nas and his Lithuanian Choir. The plays were specifically written for the occasion and poked fun at Birutƒó's weaknesses and strengths. In 1908‚Äì1909, the society resumed the tradition of organizing concerts and theater performances at various rural locations of Lithuania Minor. For example, it organized an Easter concert in Katyƒçiai in 1909. Initially it enlisted the help of a choir from Tauragƒó, but soon reestablished its own choir (1909‚Äì1912), directed by Albert Johann Niemann. However, the events were not as popular or well executed as those of the Lithuanian Choir of Tilsit. Vilniaus ≈æinios in particular harshly criticized the performance of Ponas ir mu≈æikai in 1908. In 1910, the society commemorated the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. The celebration was inspired not only by the 25th anniversary of the society, but also by the German commemoration of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest a year earlier.Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 89 Not all Prussian Lithuanians supported the event. In articles published in Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga and Til≈æƒós Keleiwis, opponents argued for maintaining good relations with all neighbors and not following the example of Poles who irresponsibly provoked conflicts. They also directed people's attention to the 100th death anniversary of the beloved Louise, Queen of Prussia.Safronovas (2011) Bandymas formuoti alternatyvƒÖ, p. 91 In June 1910, Prussian Lithuanian youth gathered on Rambynas. It started a boom of youth organizations in various town; in a few years more than 15 local organizations were established. In 1912, they united under the umbrella organization Santara. These organizations took the initiative and overshadowed Birutƒó, which ceased its activities altogether in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. Legacy In September 1911, Vanagaitis started publishing journal Birutƒó which began using the term Lithuania Minor more often, competing with previous preferred term Prussian Lithuania. This reflected a shift in the understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green‚Äìwhite‚Äìred flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the great leader), it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutƒó provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians knew more about the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutƒó was plagued by lack of leadership and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages. Library In March 1908, Birutƒó transferred its library and archaeological collection to the Lithuanian Scientific Society in Vilnius. At that time, the library had about 750 books, most of which were acquired via donations. The donors included linguists Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and Adalbert Bezzenberger, publishers of Au≈°ra and Varpas, and others. About 61% of the books were in the Lithuanian language with German books accounting for 13%. The society did not have separate premises and stored the books at home of its librarians, who included Dovas Zaunius and Jonas Smalakys.

Kim Haengsook at the Book Fair in Gothenburg 2019.  Life  Kim Haengsook was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1970. She studied Korean language education at Korea University, where she also earned her master's and doctoral degree in Korean literature. She made her literary debut in 1999 when the journal Hyundae Munhak published ‚ÄúPpul‚Äù (Îøî Horn) and a few other poems. She is primarily associated with the Korean Futurism school of poetry, which emerged in the 2000s when young poets began writing experimental works that broke with the lyrical tradition of South Korea. Kim published her first poetry collection Sachungi (ÏÇ¨Ï∂òÍ∏∞ Adolescence) in 2003, which earned critical and popular acclaim for its unconventional style and put her alongside other Korean Futurist poets like Hwang Byungsng, Kim Kyung Ju, Kim Min-jeong, and Ha Jaeyoun. She won the 9th Nojak Literature Prize in 2009, the inaugural Jeon Bonggeon Literary Award in 2015, and the 16th Midang Literary Award in 2016. She was an editor for the quarterly journal World Literature, and currently teaches Korean literature at Kangnam University.  Writing  Kim Haengsook's work has been referred to as ‚Äúa symptom of contemporary poetry‚Äù that ‚Äúachieved a new kind of lyricism‚Äù by writer and literary critic Lee Jangwook. Starting with her first poetry collection Sachungi (ÏÇ¨Ï∂òÍ∏∞ Adolescence), the strangeness and ambiguity of her poems challenged readers to find new ways of interpreting them other than simply looking for meaning or images. In a commentary on her second poetry collection Ibyeoreui neungryeok (Ïù¥Î≥ÑÏùò Îä•Î†• The Ability to Part) (2007), literary critic Shin Hyeong-cheol argues that Kim ‚Äúdoes not write with intuition but with the mind of a programmer‚Äù who has ‚Äúthe ability to enter into a particular world of feeling and to invite readers into that world.‚Äù Kim's language is open to various interpretations. It has been described as ‚Äúsliding or floating across the signifier and the signified.‚Äù Literary critic Shin Hyeong-cheol notes that Kim ‚Äúbreaks down the world into pieces of feeling and allows the self to become a vessel for each feeling. Her poetry is freely fantastical and unegotistically objective.‚Äù Kim's third poetry collection Tainui uimi (ÌÉÄÏù∏Ïùò ÏùòÎØ∏ The Significance of Others) (2010) shows a slight change in style. The world of feeling she portrays in previous poems remains the same, but she focuses on the sensations born from the relationship between the self and the Other. The self strives to reach the Other, fails, and accepts a fate of solitude.  Works   Poetry Collections  1\\\\. „ÄéÏÇ¨Ï∂òÍ∏∞„Äè(Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 2003) Adolescence.

Life  Nam Jin-Woo was born in Jeonju, South Korea in 1960. He studied creative writing at Chung-Ang University, where he also received his master‚Äôs and doctoral degrees. His literary career began when he won the Dong-a Ilbo New Writer's Contest for poetry in 1981 and the Chosun Ilbo New Writer‚Äôs Contest for literary criticism in 1983. He was an editor at the quarterly journal Munhakdongne and the monthly journal Hyeondaesihak. Since 2004, he has been teaching creative writing at Myongji University. In the 1980s, he was a member of the literary society Siundong (‚Äúpoetry movement‚Äù) alongside poets Ha Jae-bong, Lee Moon-jae, and Park Deok-kyu. In 1999, he married the novelist Shin Kyung-sook. As a poet and critic, he played a major role in turning Munhakdongne into a quarterly magazine that introduced the latest Korean literature in the 1990s. In 1992, he accused writer Lee In-hwa for plagiarizing his debut novel Naega nuguinji malhal su itneun janeun nuguinga (ÎÇ¥Í∞Ä ÎàÑÍµ¨Ïù∏ÏßÄ ÎßêÌï† Ïàò ÏûàÎäî ÏûêÎäî ÎàÑÍµ¨Ïù∏Í∞Ä Who Is It That Can Tell Me Who I Am) from other sources, and has since participated in other plagiarism debates. In the early 2000s, he actively voiced his opinion on the controversy over whether Munhakdongne, along with several other literary journals, was exercising too much power in the South Korean literary scene. In 2015, he became involved in a plagiarism debate once again, this time surrounding his wife and novelist Shin Kyung-sook. As the debate intensified, Nam resigned from the Munhakdongne editing committee. Nam has earned critical and popular acclaim for his literary criticism and poetry. He won the 8th Dongsuh Literary Award for best criticism in 1995, the 9th Kim Daljin Literature Prize for best poetry in 1998, the 11th Socheon Lee Heon-gu Literary Criticism Award in 1999, the 46th Hyundae Literary Award for best criticism in 2001, the 13th Palbong Literary Criticism Award in 2002, the 15th Daesan Literary Award for best poetry in 2007, and the 22nd Daesan Literary Award for best criticism in 2014.  Writing  Nam Jin-Woo is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúpilgrim who does not stop pursuing what is sacred or mysterious.‚Äù Since his first poetry collection Gipeun gose geumureul deuriura (ÍπäÏùÄ Í≥≥Ïóê Í∑∏Î¨ºÏùÑ ÎìúÎ¶¨Ïö∞Îùº Cast the Net into Deep Waters), he has primarily been concerned with the transcendental sacred. He attempts to ‚Äúreach the sacred by writing about the impossibility of sacredness in this unfortunate era.‚Äù Nam uses imagery such as flames, sand dunes, unexpected visits by animals, the deep hue of death, and distant sounds. Nam‚Äôs work has strong religious and fatalist themes. He believes that his task as a poet is to persistently seek salvation even if it proves impossible.

Background  The applicant, Tenguiz Assanidze was the former Mayor of Batumi and member of the Ajarian Parliament, an Autonomous Republic of Georgia.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [21] Assanidze was arrested on 4 October 1993 under \\"suspicion of illegal financial dealings in the Batumi Tobacco Manufacturing Company and the unlawful possession and handling of firearms\\". He was subsequently sentenced to 8 years imprisonment.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [22] In 1999 Assanidze was pardoned by President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze in Decree no. 1200 but was not released and remained imprisoned by the Ajarian authorities. The Batumi Tobacco Manufacturing Company disputed the pardon and it was put on hold.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [24]Code of Administrative Procedure, Article 29 In 1999 the Ajarian High court quashed the pardon.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R.

Apr. 8, 2004), at [26] The legislation in place at the time put the case in the hands of the Administrative and Tax Affairs Panel of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal.Article 360 of the Civil Code On the same day he was acquitted by presidential pardon, Assanidze was charged with criminal association and kidnapping.Assanidze v.

After an \\"exhaustive\\" fact finding effort by the prosecution it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to convict Assanidze.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R.

Apr. 8, 2004), at [37] The case went to trial where the prosecution arranged for the defendant's brother, David Assanidze, to give evidence that the defendant had supplied funds and two machine guns that were instrumental in the kidnapping attempt.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [40] Further, it was alleged that the defendant had orchestrated the 1996 crime which ended in the murder of the head of the regional department of the Ministry of the Interior for Khelvachauri. The Ajarian High Court gave its judgment based solely on the evidence given by the three members of the group involved in the kidnapping who had been found guilty when the case was first tried in 1996 and convicted the defendant.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [43] He was sentenced to twelve years‚Äô imprisonment.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R.

Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [62] Despite multiple letters to the Ajarian authorities commenting on the breach of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Convention on Human Rights and the \\"reckless disregard for the rule of law\\" no further progress was made to secure the applicant's release.Assanidze v.

In 2001 an application was made to the European Court of Human Rights alleging a violation of Assanidze's rights guaranteed by Article 5 ¬ß 1, 3 and 4, Article 6 ¬ß 1, Article 10 ¬ß 1 and Article 13 of the Convention, and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4.Assanidze v.

Apr. 8, 2004), at [159] Noting that the applicant had exhausted all \\"domestic remedies\\" to no avail, it was decided that the court would consider only the detention from 29 January 2001, the date that the Supreme Court of Georgia ordered the release of the applicant .Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [159], [172] Despite his release being ordered by the Supreme Court of Georgia, the applicant remained incarcerated in an Ajarian Ministry of Security prison even though no further charges or order had been laid before the local Court to warrant his detainment.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R.

Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [187] As a result, the Court did not investigate this complaint.  Article 6 (fair trial)  The judgment made on 29 January 2001 ordering the applicant's release was not followed and therefore \\"deprived the provisions of Article 6 ¬ß 1 of the Convention of all useful effect\\". Further, the Court said that Article 6 would be 'illusory\\" should a final judicial decision to acquit not be followed causing measurable harm to the defendant.Assanidze v.

Article 10 (freedom of expression)  The Court found no reason to sustain a submission that there had been a breach of the applicant's freedom of expression.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [192] Neither party added any further argument to prove or disprove a breach beyond the initial application.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [191]  Article 2 of Protocol no. 4 (right to move freely)  The applicant's argument for finding a breach of his right to \\"liberty of movement\\" protected under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 was deemed not to be relevant by the Court.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [194] The restriction of this right was due to the applicant's incarceration and not any other restriction.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [193] The Court was therefore of the opinion that an examination of Article 5 would sufficiently satisfy any claim of this nature and deemed it unnecessary to investigate the alleged violation Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 any further.  Article 41 (just satisfaction)  Using the powers afforded by Article 41 the Court, noting the extreme circumstances of the applicant's detainment, ordered that Assanidze be released at \\"the earliest possible\\" date.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at [202] In addition, they ordered the State to pay ‚Ç¨150,000 plus value-added tax in damages.Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur.

Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004) at [197] In addition to the sum awarded for damages the Court followed, inter alia, the previous decision in Maestri v. Italy that held should a violation be found, the Government must consider adopting domestic legislation to prevent any future breaches of similar nature from occurring.Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, ¬ß 47, ECHR 2004-IAssanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. Apr. 8, 2004), at 198 Despite that, the Court went on to say that given the facts of the case there are no obvious solutions that would have prevented this violation from occurring as the underlying issue of judicial authority had not been tested by the Autonomous Republic of Adjara nor was there any prior indication of transgressive behaviour by Adjara until this case.  Aftermath  After the ruling, the newly-sworn President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili ordered the Adjarian authorities to immediately release Assanidze and threatened with \\"appropriate measures\\" in case of failure to comply. The leader of Adjara, Aslan Abashidze, criticized ECHR's ruling as \\"biased\\". Assanidze was released from prison on 9 April 2004 and received his compensation in full from Georgia's government in September 2004.

(2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 10. Fair Trade New Zealand is an organisation that was launched in 2005 which supports fair trade by ensuring that farmers and workers' rights are not exploited.Fair Trade Australia New Zealand \\"Who We Are\\" (2016). According to Oxfam New Zealand, there are several companies to support fairly traded goods from, which are exported to New Zealand.Oxfam New Zealand \\"Fair trade\\" (2017).

From 2015-2016 this number rose to 54 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report Fair Trade By The Numbers. Gwen Green, Oxfam's Engagement Director, says: \\"when farmers are paid fairly for their products, we see people able to make real improvements to their lives and their communities.

The right to equality and non-discrimination provides that human beings, regardless of their status or membership of a particular group, are entitled to the same set of rights.Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran International Human Rights Law (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 160. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948, includes in it protections against discrimination and slavery, and provides for the rights to freedom of association and to form and join trade unions, the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to protection against unemployment and the right to equal pay for equal work.Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 554. The significance of equality is reflected in the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'. Freedom from slavery and compulsory labour is recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8. Freedom from slavery and the prohibition of the slave trade refers to the practice of treating human beings as property.Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 82. Forced or compulsory labour is also prohibited under article 8 of the Covenant, although it is subject to exceptions. That is, performance of labour as part of a prison sentence will not breach a state's obligations.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8(3)(b). The right to employment with just and favourable conditions is recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and these conditions should provide workers with fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art 7. New Zealand law and standards New Zealand law does not generally have extraterritorial effect. The extraterritorial application of human rights regimes can be defined as the existence of a legal obligation to respect rights.Marko Milanovic Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) at 7. The Fair Trading Act 1986 deals with misleading and deceptive conduct,Fair Trading Act 1986, s 9 and despite its title, has no direct legal connection with this particular aspect of fair trade in New Zealand. In New Zealand slavery and forced labour are criminalised. A person is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years who, within or outside New Zealand, sells and purchases, or in any way whatsoever deals with any person as a slave.Crimes Act 1961, ss 98(1). Slavery is prohibited by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Slavery is also not mentioned in the Human Rights Act 1993. There is currently no law that fair trade products need to be endorsed or supported through both private and public organisations in New Zealand. Fair trade labelling laws The Fairtrade Mark indicates that products purchased by consumers are supporting farmers and workers as they work to improve their livelihoods and provide better support to their communities.Fair Trade Australia New Zealand \\"What Fairtrade Does\\" (2016).

He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika? (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 14. In contrast, the WFTO certifies organisations as fair trade organisations - throughout their entire supply chain. Principles of fair trade The Fair Trade Federation is an organisation that recognises and upholds those principles to promote equity in international trade.Fair Trade Federation \\"Fair Trade Federation Principles\\" (2017). The Federation works with The World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO) and subscribes to similar fair trade principles. The organisation has ten principles of fair trade which it follows. These principles listed below are sourced from the WFTO website:\\"Ten Principles of Fair Trade\\" (2013). # Opportunities for disadvantaged producers # Transparency and accountability # Fair trade practices # Fair payment # No child labour, no forced labour # No discrimination, gender equity, freedom of association # Good working conditions # Capacity building # Promote fair trade # Respect for the environment Fair trade suppliers Oxfam New Zealand works with suppliers that sell a range of fair trade products in New Zealand.Oxfam New Zealand \\"Buy Fairtrade\\" (2017).

Universities There are two universities in New Zealand that have been recognised by the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand as fair trade universities. In 2013 the University of Otago became the first New Zealand university to be granted fair trade accreditation, along with more than 100 universities around the world that have become fair trade institutions.University of Otago \\"Otago Becomes New Zealand's First Fairtrade University\\" (2017) Vice Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says: \\"I am proud of the effort staff and students have gone to make this happen and look forward to a long and meaningful association with Fairtrade. We now have Fairtrade products available at all seven outlets on campus and 90 per cent of residential students have access to Fairtrade products in their colleges\\". In July 2017, the University of Canterbury was also granted fair trade accreditation, becoming the first entirely fair trade campus in New Zealand.University of Canterbury \\"Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University\\" (2017). The fair trade criteria for accreditation is that 50 per cent of products should be fair trade, where that option is available.University of Canterbury \\"Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University\\" (2017). The supporting of fair trade products at University of Canterbury means that the campus uses fair trade coffee, tea and hot drinking chocolate, as well as selling Trade Aid chocolate.University of Canterbury \\"Fair Trade\\" (2017). Chair of the UC Fair Trade Committee Dr John Hopkins stated \\"by the time we applied for accreditation, UC purchases for tea and coffee had reached 80 per cent, and are still rising\\".

History The station opened on 10 August 1847 as the temporary terminus of the line from Church Fenton, because engineering works between Spofforth and Harrogate, which included the Prospect Tunnel and the Crimple Valley Viaduct, had not been finished at this date. Horse-drawn omnibuses provided onward transport to Harrogate until the remainder of the line to Harrogate Brunswick station was opened to traffic on 20 July 1848, and Spofforth became a through station. In the early 20th century, barley was the main freight handled at the station. In the 1950s, general goods and livestock (including horses and prize cattle) were handled here, and the station offered the carriage of motor cars by train. The station was closed completely on 6 January 1964, and by 1971 most of the buildings had been demolished. The area has been overbuilt in the mid-1990s, and the housing development of Station Court now occupies the site. Location The station was located at the level crossing with today's A661 road at the southern end of the village. West of it (), near Spofforth Castle, a short viaduct with five spans of about height and slightly over length led the line across a hollow. It is still standing, but in a deteriorating condition. Between Spofforth and Wetherby York Road, close to the latter station, was the triangular junction with the Cross Gates‚ÄìWetherby line. Facilities The station had two side platforms. The station building, designed by George Townsend Andrews and similar to that of Ruswarp, stood on the up platform. The down platform had a wooden waiting room of standard NER design. The signal box was located on the south-eastern side of the level crossing on the down side of the line. The main goods yard was located behind the down platform and was accessed from the west. Its two sidings served a stone-built goods shed and a loading dock. A cattle dock on the up side was served by a third siding north-west of the crossing. Two more sidings on the up side, serving the coal yard, branched off south-east of the level crossing.

However, allelochemicals produced by garlic mustard do not affect mycorrhizal fungi from garlic mustard's native range, indicating that this \\"novel weapon\\" in the invaded range explains garlic mustard's success in North America. Additionally, because white-tailed deer rarely feed on garlic mustard, large deer populations may help to increase its population densities by consuming competing native plants. Trampling by browsing deer encourages additional seed growth by disturbing the soil. Seeds contained in the soil can germinate up to five years after being produced (and possibly more). The persistence of the seed bank and suppression of mycorrhizal fungi both complicate restoration of invaded areas because long-term removal is required to deplete the seed bank and allow recovery of mycorrhizae.Anderson RC, Anderson MR, Bauer JT, Slater M, Herold JM, Baumhardt VA. 2010. Effect of removal of garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata Brassicaceae) on Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi inoculum potential in forest soils. Open Ecology Journal 3:41‚Äì47 Garlic mustard produces a variety of secondary compounds including flavonoids, defense proteins, glycosides, and glucosinolates that reduce its palatability to herbivores. In northeastern forests, garlic mustard rosettes increase the rate of native leaf litter decomposition, increasing nutrient availability and possibly creating conditions favorable to garlic mustard's own spread. Control strategies Accurately targeted biological control is the method of control that is the least-damaging to ecosystems not typified by monoculture, like forested areas, while also being the most efficient in terms of costs.Eubanks, HM.D., Hoffmann, J.H., Lewis, E.E., Liu, J., Melnick, R., Michaud, J.P., Ode, P., Pell, J.K., 2017.

University of Florida. https://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/manage/control-methods/biological-control/ For the management of some invasive plants, or in some cases when dealing with garlic mustard, herbicide application and human-managed labor such as mowing, tilling, burning, and pulling may be preferred for managing unwanted vegetation on land that is highly disturbed by human activity, such as agricultural land. This effort is usually rendered more effective by the supplemental presence of biological control agents. For more complex ecosystems such as forests, trampling and other physical disturbance such as soil compaction, the spreading of seeds from clothing, chemical toxicity, unwanted non-targeted species damage, demanding human labor, petrochemical consumption, and other factors are eliminated or greatly reduced with effective biological control. One species of weevil that targets garlic mustard, for instance, consumes the seeds.Driesche, F.V.; Blossey, B.; Hoodle, M.; Lyon, S.; Reardon, R., 2010. Biological Control of Invasive Plants in the Eastern United States. USDA Forest Service. Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team. http://wiki.bugwood.org/Archive:BCIPEUS Unlike with some invasive plants which are annuals, such as Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), the mowing of garlic mustard is less effective because it regrows from its tap root, especially if it is mowed in its second, flowering, year ‚Äî where the root has grown enough to store considerable energy. Monophagous controllers, such as the weevil C. scrobicollis, which only feeds on garlic mustard, are usually the most ideal candidates for initial introduction to combat invasive plants, as they greatly reduce the chance that the introduced controller will itself become a pest.Davis, Adam. 2009. Munching on Garlic Mustard - A New Weevil in the Works. United States Department of Agriculture - AgResearch Magazine. https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2009/jul/weevil/ Difficulties involved in using biological control are identifying species that are safe to introduce as well as relying on fewer controlling species being present in the non-native ecosystem. Up to 76 things feed on garlic mustard in its native environment. By contrast, nothing eats it to a significant extent in the United States where it is non-native.Blossy, B., Ode, P., Pell, J.K., 1999. Development of Biological Control for Garlic Mustard. Cornell University. https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/grants/documents/wpfgrantreports/1998l06w.pdf Despite there being so many controlling agents for that plant, it is currently estimated that adequate control of garlic mustard's invasiveness in portions of the United States where it is problematic can be achieved by the introduction of just two weevils, with C. scrobicollis being the most important of the two.Becker, R., 2017. Implementing Biological Control of Garlic Mustard - Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund 2017 RFP. http://www.lccmr.leg.mn/proposals/2017/original/107-d.pdf The example of garlic mustard shows how effective, at least in Minnesota's controlled trials and European field observations, even one monophagous biological control agent can be, while having the fewest costs.Katovich, J., Gerber, E., Hinz H., Skinner, L., Ragsdale, D., Becker, R., 2007. The Garlic Mustard Biocontrol Story - Past, Present and Future. Bugwood.org. https://bugwoodcloud.org/mura/mipn/assets/File/Annual%20Meeting%2007%20presentations/natareaconf07.pdf Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of C. scrobicollis and, potentially, C. constrictus, the importation and release of biological control agents such as those may be stymied by heavy research and regulation requirements. Those who believe the regulations are well-crafted argue they are needed to prevent the agents from becoming highly undesirable pests while critics argue that the regulations, as currently written and implemented, make it too difficult to bypass more damaging, less effective, and more costly methods of control ‚Äî such as applying herbicides in forests. As of May 2017, there is no legally- approved biological control agent to combat garlic mustard in the United States. Garlic mustard has been researched by the United States since the 1990s and C. scrobicollis has been studied specifically since 2002. The 2012 recommendation to release it into the US was blocked by the TAG group.Reardon, R., 2012. Garlic Mustard Biological Control ‚Äî Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team. https://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/technology/pdfs/FS_garlicmustard.pdf Preventing seed production and depletion of the soil seed bank are key to eradicating infestations, but seeds can last as long as twelve years and just one plant can produce thousands of seeds.USDA Forest Service - Northeastern Area. \\"Garlic Mustard\\". Forest Invasive Plants Resource Center.. https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/invasiveplants/factsheets/pdf/garlic-mustard.pdf Seeds are also easily tracked around by animals, vehicles, and people. Non- chemical non-biological control methods include removal by hand-pulling or cutting at the base, mowing, burning, or manipulation of the environment to reduce light. Pulling is more effective if the entire root is removed and desirable plants and soils are not trampled and compacted. Garlic mustard can invade stable forests as well as disturbed sites. It can grow in deep shade as well as full sunlight and in a wide range of moisture levels. Therefore, management by planting or encouraging other plants to intercept light will not prevent new infestations, although it may slow them. Control is best in early spring prior to flowering because the plants are smaller which reduces soil disturbance and loss from pulling, as well as giving competing plants more of the season to expand. However, it is easy to miss the small plants, which can flower even when less than three inches in above-ground height. The flowers increase visibility, especially in lower light situations. Some plants' roots will also break off, even with careful pulling technique, leaving pieces in the soil that will regrow. Root breakage is most common in soil compacted by foot traffic and in drier conditions. Mowing and cutting are also more effective prior to the plants flowering because the mowed and cut plant pieces are less likely to possess enough energy to bloom and generate viable seed. Removed plants should be bagged (and disposed of correctly) or burned, as seeds or roots may survive composting. Pulled plants can bloom and produce seed, particularly if the roots are attached, even while the plants are withering and dying. Chemical control may be achieved to some extent by foliar application with a number of herbicides, although their use is much more efficacious in highly disturbed situations, like agricultural monocultures or urban and suburban gardens, than in complex settings, like forests and well- established meadows or prairies. Timing herbicide applications to the earliest spring may help to better protect native or desirable plants in the same locations as garlic mustard is generally active earlier than most other plants in northern temperate climates, one of the reasons it can generally outcompete native plants and displace them.Panke B., Renz M., 2012. Management of invasive plants in Wisconsin: Garlic mustard. University of Wisconsin- Extension Team Horticulture. http://learningstore.uwex.edu/Assets/pdfs/A3924-07.pdf However, there are native and desirable plants that are active even before garlic mustard is, and/or at the same time in early spring, such as flowers from the genera Pulsatilla and Helleborus of the family Ranunculaceae. Some native and desirable plants also are evergreen and thus vulnerable to foliar and post- emergent herbicides at all times. Chemical control methods that involve heavy equipment or human trampling can compact soils, affecting all plants negatively. Such methods can disturb wildlife and chemical solutions may cause chemical pollution such as tainted water through runoff. All non-biological methods of control must be repeated for 2‚Äì5 years to be effective‚Äîas most infestations occur in sites where a considerable seed bank has been established. Those will continue to germinate for over a decade. Surviving roots regrow and produce new seed pods, enabling the infestation to potentially be quickly reestablished. Continual reintroduction of garlic mustard to areas where it has been eradicated is also highly likely until an effective biological control situation is established, as the long-lived seeds are produced in great quantities and are readily distributed by animals and human activity. Of the 76 natural enemies garlic mustard has in its native range, several have been tested for use as potential biological control agents. Five weevil species from the genus Ceutorhynchus and one flea beetle were selected as candidates during preliminary testing. Since that time, the United States' employees studying these candidates narrowed the list. The monophagous weevil C. scrobicollis, studied since 2002, was officially recommended for introduction into the US in 2012 but the TAG group blocked its introduction, requesting further research be conducted. As of May 2017, it has not been approved for introduction and the continued research funding has not been provided. It was also petitioned by another researcher in 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2016. Additional research was requested by TAG in response to the 2008 petition. It was completed but the petitions continue to be blocked.

She was the first and thus far only woman and Jew to hold this position. Early life Eve Poole was born Eva Auerbach in Frankfurt, Germany on 29 December 1924. Her family fled to Tel Aviv, Palestine (now Israel) in 1932 after her father was brutally beaten in a Nazi street demonstration against Jews. From 1939 to 1945 she served in the British Eighth Army as a driver in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was during this time that she met her husband, Vernon Poole, who was a tank commander in the 20th Battalion of the 2nd New Zealand Division. They married in Cairo, Egypt, and after the war they settled down in Invercargill. Together they had four children, Helen, Vivienne, Michele, and Clive. Having trained at Habima Theatre, Poole went on to teach drama at Southland Girls' High School. She also worked as a speech therapist for the disabled and was fluent in German, English, French, and Hebrew. Political career Poole was elected to the Invercargill City Council in 1971. She was only the second woman to ever run for the council, and was the first to be elected. She topped the poll in 1974 and was made Deputy Mayor. In 1980 she made her first challenge for Mayor but was unsuccessful, losing to the incumbent F. Russell Miller by 400 votes. In the 1982 Queen's Birthday Honours, Poole was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. Poole returned to politics in 1983, making a second run for Mayor. She won 56.8 per cent of the vote, becoming the first woman mayor and first Jewish mayor of Invercargill. The 1984 Southland flood occurred early in her first term and she was praised for her response. Her daughter Michele would go on to have a career in emergency management. As Mayor, Poole was highly involved in the arts. Norman Jones, the National Party MP for Invercargill, described her as having brought nothing but \\"culture and emotion\\" to Southland. She was instrumental in the construction of the Invercargill Public Library, which was later named in her honour after her death in 1992. She served as president of the Southland Museum Trust Board, and as a member of the Anderson Park Art Gallery Council and the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council. She was also dedicated to the brightening and beautifying of the city, planting flowers in the city centre, installing coloured paving stones, and buying secondhand Christmas lights from Regent Street in London. Poole established Invercargill's first sister city relationship with Kumagaya, Japan. In 1992 she was awarded a Melvin Jones Fellowship by Lions Clubs International. Death Only a month after being elected to a fourth term, Poole was admitted to Dunedin Hospital in late November 1992 due to severe back pain. She developed an infection during the course of examination, and died peacefully on 26 December 1992, aged 67. She is buried at Invercargill's Eastern Cemetery, along with her husband who died on 27 April 2002.

He was the governor of Jakarta, in office between 15 June and 15 October 2017 after being acting governor since 9 May. He replaced his predecessor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (commonly known as Ahok) when the latter was found guilty of blasphemy against Islam. He was appointed by Basuki as Deputy Governor in 2014 to fill the gap left by the election of Joko Widodo as president. Member of PDI-P, his political career began as a member of East Java's Regional Parliament between 1999 and 2000, before he was elected as Mayor of Blitar where he served a 10-year tenure. He was later elected into the People's Representative Council before his move into the capital's governance. Personal life Early life Born as Saiful Hidayat in Magelang, Central Java on 6 July 1962 as son of an army veteran, he received his forename Djarot from a merchant in a traditional market in his hometown. Education He earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 from Brawijaya University in Malang, majoring in administrative science. He continued to Gadjah Mada University for his Masters in Political Science and graduated in 1991. Before he entered politics, he was a lecturer in the 17 August 1945 University in Surabaya. Family Djarot married Happy Farida in 1999 and has 3 children. Political career After the fall of Suharto, he joined PDI-P and successfully ran for a seat in the province's Regional People‚Äôs Representative Council in 1999. During his term, he was appointed as chairman of Commission A (on government). Mayor of Blitar (2000‚Äì2010) After being appointed Mayor in 2000, he started his mayorship by culling nearly 300 excess government positions from the city of 100,000. After his re-election in the first regional elections of the country in 2005, Djarot's governance of Blitar earned 3 consecutive Adipura (cleanliness award) awards between 2006 and 2008. In his term, he focused on organizing the local street vendors and traditional markets instead of more modern shopping centres. In addition, he provided aid of Rp 4-7 million (US$400‚Äì700) to citizens with underrenovated housing. The city's government was also awarded first place in the implementation of an e-government and Citizen's Charter on health. He did not run in the 2010 elections due to a constitutional term limit. During his tenure as mayor, he first met Ahok in 2006, when the latter was still regent of East Belitung. Move to the capital In the 2012 Jakarta elections which pitted later-president Joko Widodo (Jokowi) against then-governor Fauzi Bowo, Djarot was the chief adviser of Jokowi's campaign team. He ran for a position in the People's Representative Council in 2014, through the East Java 6 election district which included Blitar and Kediri (city and regency) in addition to Tulungagung Regency. He secured 69,053 votes - the fourth highest in the district out of a quota of nine - and won a seat. President and former Jakartan Governor Joko Widodo with Djarot during the latter's swearing in following Basuki's removal from office. Months after his election into the legislative body, Jokowi defeated Prabowo Subianto to become the 7th President of Indonesia. Consequentially, Basuki was elevated to the rank of governor and left his former position of vice governor vacant. As PDI-P sought for a replacement, his name was brought up along with that of Boy Sadikin (eldest son of late former governor Ali Sadikin). In the end, Ahok selected Djarot as his deputy and he was put into office on December 17. According to Basuki, he had set his eyes on the former mayor since before he officially became Vice Governor. Upon his appointment, Djarot immediately started conducting highly publicized visits known popularly as blusukan often done by Jokowi during his term but somewhat less commonly for Basuki. In 2017, the pair ran for Jakartan governorship until 2022 against both former Minister of Education Anies Baswedan and Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, son of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. After failing to secure a majority in the first elections while placing first, the pair was defeated by Baswedan who won 57.96 percent of the vote in the run-off elections. Around the same time, Ahok had been accused of blasphemy against Islam during an initially obscure visit to Kepulauan Seribu Regency. The case gained widespread national and international attention, with a series of mass protests calling for the governor's prosecution. During the court proceedings, he was non-activated, with Djarot serving as acting governor in his place. Despite accusations of political motivation behind the case and international clemency requests, Basuki was found guilty and sentenced to 2 years in jail after a highly publicized trial. Djarot later offered to become a guarantor for his running mate's conditional release. After Basuki withdrew his appeal to the Supreme Court and resigned from governorship, Djarot was officially inaugurated by Joko Widodo in the State Palace as the governor of Jakarta on June 15 after serving as acting Governor for about a month. He became the third governor to serve in the five-year period between 2012 and 2017, after Joko Widodo and Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. As governor (2017) Following the prohibition of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, the Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, he proposed to revoke the citizenship of Jakartan civil servants affiliated with the organization. He was succeeded by governor-elect Anies Baswedan on 16 October 2017. Post-governorship After his tenure ended, Djarot was assigned by his party to lead the East Kalimantan office until the 2018 local elections. In January 2018, PDI-P selected him as candidate for the governorship of North Sumatra, with Sihar Sitorus as running mate. He would however lose to Edy Rahmayadi and Musa Rajekshah. Following his defeat, he ran in the 2019 legislative election, competing for a seat in the People's Representative Council from North Sumatra 3rd electoral district and got elected.

Because the historical sources referring to Agustin de Legazpi were all written by Spanish chroniclers, it is unclear whether he used the title of \\"Lakan\\", which was reserved for the paramount ruler of Tondo. Historical sources refer to him using the hispanized name \\"Don Agustin de Legazpi\\" instead. Legazpi is believed to have been the biological son of an unnamed deceased sibling of Rajah Sulayman of Maynila, and was adopted as a son by Sulayman upon the death of Sulayman's own only son sometime in the early days of the Spanish conquest of Luzon. Upon conversion to Roman Catholicism under the new Spanish regime, he is believed to have been sponsored for baptism by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi himself, explaining the similar family names. Upon the death of Lakandula of Tondo, Agustin de Legazpi was proclaimed to the title of Paramount ruler at Tondo, even though Lakandula had several male children. Lakandula's children served as Datus under Agustin de Legazpi, and two of them ‚Äì Magat Salamat and Felipe Salonga ‚Äì joined Agustin de Legazpi in the Tondo Conspiracy. As a result of the uncovering of the Tondo Conspiracy, Agustin de Legazpi and Magat Salamat were executed, while Felipe Salonga was sent to exile in South America for eight years.  Historiography  Aside from his participation in the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587, few definite facts about Agustin de Legazpi's life were documented in 20th Century history textbooks until historian Luciano P.R. Santiago his paper, \\"The Houses Of Lakandula, Matanda And Soliman (1571-1898)\\" was published by the Philippine Quarterly of Culture & Society in 1990. The paper drew from the genealogical documents kept in the Philippines' National Archives (collectively referred to by historians as the \\"Lacandola Documents\\") and from the works of earlier historians such as Cesar Adib Majul, who documented the tarsila genealogies of Sulu and Maguindanao, and has since become considered a seminal work on the genealogy of the noble houses of Manila and Tondo.

The most notable building in the area is a large water tank, begun in 1923 and completed in 1927, which was originally intended to supply water to Dalwallinu but because of problems with pumping water over the hills it ended up supplying local farms instead.

The venom plays a central role in the biology of Red imported fire ants, such as in capturing prey, and in defending itself from competitors, assailants, and diseases. Some 14 million people are stung annually in the United States, suffering reactions that vary from mild discomfort, to pustule formation, swelling, and in rare cases, systemic reactions followed by anaphylactic shock. Fire ant venoms are mainly composed (>95%) of a complex mixture of insoluble alkaloids added to a watery solution of toxic proteins.Fox E.G.P. (2016) Venom Toxins of Fire Ants. In: Gopalakrishnakone P., Calvete J. (eds) Venom Genomics and Proteomics. Toxinology. Springer, Dordrecht For the Red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren there are currently 46 described proteins, of which four are well-characterised as potent allergens. Venom Solenopsin, one of the components of the venom Venom plays an important role in the biology of fire ants, being used to capture prey items, nest defense, and antimicrobial action. On average, however, a worker stores very little venom (only about 0.5 ¬µg at any given time). Newborn workers contain little to no venom within their reservoirs, but workers that are only one-day old can produce 1.17 ¬µg/day. However, workers that are 17 days old only produce 0.3 ¬µg/day. Workers deliver 0.66 nl of venom when they sting, which amounts to 3.1% of their supply. Older workers deliver less venom when they sting, but middle-aged workers and nest- defenders deliver much higher quantities. Like all fire ant species, venom is secreted by the venom gland and is stored in the poison sac. When in use, it is ejected through the stinger's main duct. Capacity is between 20 and 40 nl, but this depends on the worker's size. The American entomologist Justin O. Schmidt described it as being \\"sharp, sudden, mildly alarming\\", therefore ranking at \\"1\\" in the Schmidt sting pain index, a pain scale which ranks the pain intensity of an insect's sting from 0 to 4. Over 95% of the venom components are water-insoluble piperidine alkaloids. Piperidines include trans-2-methyl-6-n-undecylpiperidines, trans-2-methyl-6-n-tridecylpiperidine, trans-2-methyl-6-(cis-4-tridecenyl) piperidines, trans-2-methyl-6-n-pentadecylpiperidine, trans-2-methyl-6-(cis-6-pentadecenyl)piperidine and 2,6-dialkylpiperidines (the ants' venom is dominated by the trans- stereoisomers of this specific ingredient). trans-2-Methyl-6-n-undecylpiperidine (solenopsin) has been shown to have cytotoxic, hemolytic, necrotic, insecticidal, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-HIV properties. As well as that, the alkaloid has shown antiangiogenic activity. These components are responsible for the formation of hives, and also for the development of sterile pustules on areas where the ant has stung. Experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) on tested female rats is 0.36 mg/kg. Approximately 46 proteins have been identified in the red imported fire ant's venom, although scientists have long believed the venom only contained alkaloids. This assumption was mostly due to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient venom for analysis because of its low protein content, which is only 0.1% of the venom's total weight. These proteins are experimentally suggested to directly account for the anaphylactic reactions seen in humans sensitive to the venom. Whilst including a number of neurotoxins and potential allergens, not all of these proteins are involved with venom function. At least four protein allergens have been characterised, named Sol i 1-4. Of these, Sol i 3, is part of the antigen 5 family, and Sol i 1 is a phospholipase A1B; Sol i 1 shows a close relation with wasp venom phospholipases. Sol i 2 and 4 are unique, odorant-binding proteins of poorly understood function. Other proteins found in the venom may benefit the colony; some of these proteins can kill off bacteria, which may explain why workers spray venom around their nests by vibrating their gasters. Other proteins also bind pheromones which may assist a worker to lay chemical trails to communicate with other nestmates. Incidence In the United States, more than 40 million people live in areas infested with fire ant populations and 14 million people are stung by them annually. A quarter of all victims stung by red imported fire ants are expected to develop sensitivity to the venom, and approximately 6,000 will suffer anaphylaxis. 51% of people who relocated themselves to infested areas report getting stung within three weeks after arrival. In a survey conducted in South Carolina, 33,000 people (or 94 per 10,000 population) received medical attention due to red imported fire ants, and 660 people (1.9 per 10 000 population) were treated for anaphylaxis. In Texas, 79% of participants in a survey stated they had been stung by red imported fire ants, while 20% had not. 61% of West Texans state they had been stung by the ants before, compared to 90% in central Texas, 89% in east Texas, 86% in the gulf coastal regions, 78% in the south and 72% in the north. In separate survey, 87% of individuals classed their reactions as mild, 12% as moderate and 1% as severe. In Australia, 64,000 homes are within red imported fire ant infested areas, and 140,000 consultations and 3,000 anaphylactic reaction cases are predicted every year by 2030 if government efforts to eradicate the ant fail. A survey conducted in China shows that one-third of participants in infested areas were victims of red imported fire ant stings. Studies suggest that the rate of systemic reactions to stings may be associated with seasonal variations in the venom's potency. 51% of allergic reactions occurred in summer, and 19% in spring. However, A survey reported a higher incidence during spring (39.9%) than summer (31.9%). Younger people, usually those under 20 years, experience the highest rate of sting attacks (50%), but the rate declines with older people. Among men and women, the rate varies as some studies report more women being attacked than men and vice versa. Deaths from red imported fire ant stings are rare, but may become common the more the ant spreads. Many cases have also been reported in the past. It is reported that more than 80 deaths have been recorded; of these, 22 cases were recorded in Florida and 19 in Texas. However, when duplicate reports are excluded, four deaths were recorded in Alabama, 10 in Florida, two in Georgia and Louisiana, and 14 in Texas. People can be educated and be made aware of the dangers of red imported fire ants. Signs and symptoms Formation of pustules on a human leg Reactions seen in humans vary; some are hypersensitive to venom while others show resilience. Hypersensitivity can be attributed to certain medical problems such as heart conditions or diabetes. Bacterial infections attributed to sting injuries also pose a problem and may require further medical attention. Most humans can withstand many stings, but others may suffer from severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. People who are stung by red imported fire ants may experience intense local burning or flare- ups, followed by reddening of the skin at the sting site. This area will swell into a bump, hive or vesicle within 20 minutes. White fluid-filled sterile pustules begin to form within hours or days after being stung. Pustules on the skin remain for a couple of days, and may become infected which would require medical attention. In most cases, pustules dry up in a matter of weeks and leave brown scars that either remain for several months or become permanent. The formation of pustules occurs in almost every person stung by the ants. In one study, 96% of participants reported the formation of pustules, whereas 2% reported large local reactions. Between 17% to 56% of people stung develop venom-specific IgE. Many of them will experience pruritic lumps around areas where the ants stung, known as late-phase responses or cutaneous allergic reactions. Pustule formation can only be prevented if the ants are removed before they have a chance to sting. Once venom has been injected, pustules will form and no form of treatment will prevent them from occurring. Medications such as antibiotics, diphenylhydrazines, epinephrines or topical steroids will not affect pustular reactions. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.6 to 6% of people who have been stung by the ants, and it can be fatal if left untreated. Typical symptoms of anaphylaxis include dizziness, headaches, fever, severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, serious swelling, and slurred speech. One case reports a victim feeling strong vertigo 5 to 10 minutes after being stung, followed by glassy eyes, dry mouth, paleness, unconsciousness and severe cramps on the sting sites. In addition, neuropathy, seizures (even without any evidence of prior systemic reactions), cerebrovascular accidents, and nephrotic syndrome have been associated with red imported fire ant stings. A series of neurotoxins have been identified in red imported fire ant venom, which may explain why some victims experience hallucinations after they have been stung. Treatment Adrenaline (also called epinephrine) can quickly reverse the adverse events of dyspnoea and hypotension It is suggested that a conservative approach be used when treating sting injuries; specifically, the kind of treatment used should be based on the symptoms. For minor sting injuries, with symptoms only including pustule formations and pain, over-the-counter products are available to prevent infection. Ants should be removed by washing the area with antiseptic soap, and itchiness. It is rare for ant sting sites to become infected, so the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not always required. Victims who show signs of anaphylaxis are treated with antihistamines, epinephrines, and parenteral corticosteroids. Epinephrine is the first product for use to treat systemic allergic responses, particularly if a patient is experiencing dyspnoea or hypotension because it is capable of reversing adverse events quickly and is very safe to use. It is recommended that people who have suffered from anaphylaxis carry an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen), should dyspnoea or hypotension begin to occur. Whole body extract immunotherapy (WBE) to treat victims of anaphylaxis has been in use since 1973. Anyone who has a suspected allergy to the venom is redirected to an allergist for assessment. The treatment uses the entire body of the ant and not just the venom, and unlike fire ant venom immunotherapy (which is occasionally used), WBE contains venom proteins. To reduce a patient's sensitivity to the venom, gradual increases of dose extracts are injected into the body. WBE immunotherapy appears to be very effective in preventing systemic reactions; in one study of participants who completed WBE immunotherapy, two out of fifteen participants suffered from allergic reactions upon being stung 18 months after immunotherapy. As mentioned, fire ant venom immunotherapy is occasionally used, and studies show it can reduce the risk of systemic reactions. In fact, another study claims that fire ant venom immunotherapy is more effective than WBE immunotherapy. Fire ant venom immunotherapy is not recommended for children with large local reactions, although an exception may be made for those who live in heavily infested areas. There is also an increased risk of systemic allergic reactions to future stings in children who have cutaneous manifestations after getting stung. This makes many experts put some children on fire ant venom immunotherapy, while others do not. The recommended maintenance dose is between 0.5 mL of a 1:100 w/v 1:10 w/v WBE. For fire ant venom immunotherapy, the most common maintenance dose is 0.5 mL of a 1:200 (wt/vol) dilution. During the build-up phase, it is recommended that dosing is given weekly or biweekly, although some scientists suggest that rush protocols can be successful. It is recommended that patients going through immunotherapy receive treatment for three to five years, and lifelong therapy, although there is no consensus as to how long an individual should be treated. Stings to animals The stings of the red imported fire ant in animals are painful, and may prove life-threatening. In dogs, stings from the red imported fire ant can cause pustular dermatosis, a condition where pustules appear in crops as a result of the ant sting. After getting stung, the immediate response consists of erythema and swelling. The pustules remain for approximately 24 hours, whereas in humans they can last for several days. In livestock, red imported ants mostly sting animals in regions with no hair, particularly around the ears, eyes, muzzle, the perineum and ventral portion of the abdomen. Newborn or young livestock can be blinded or killed when attacked by the ants. Healthy individuals are less likely to be attacked than weak or sick animals. Red papule and mild swelling occur, followed by vesicopustule with a red halo developing within 24 to 48 hours. The eyes and eyelids are commonly damaged from the stings; in sheep and goats, ophthalmic ointment containing antibiotics and corticosteroids can be used to treat the eyes of sheep and goats, but this treatment is not recommended for horses. In non-domestic animals, cases of red imported fire ants stings in animals such as ferrets, moles squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and newborn blackbucks have been reported, as well as lizards and screech owl nestlings. The aftermath of the injuries is like those in domestic animals. Red imported fire ants are known to actively kill vertebrate animals, and cause significant livestock losses.Adams, C.T. (1986) Agricultural and medical impact of the imported fire ants. In: Lofgren, C.S. and Vander Meer, R.K. (eds) Fire Ants and Leq.fcutting Ants: Biology and Management. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, pp. 48-57. Animals may trigger major stinging episodes when they disturb active nests, with thousands of ants participating in the attack. During such episodes, an animal may suffer from hundreds to thousands of individual stings. It is suspected that many victims of the red imported fire ants may be depressed as a result of the effects of the toxin. Some animals may swallow red imported fire ants as they lick or bite around the sites they are stinging. This can cause additional injuries inside the animal itself, especially in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In suckling white tail deer fawns, sting sites have been found in the oesophagus and abomasum; toxins from the ingested ants may cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining.

Branca was a professor emeritus of Italian literature at the University of Padua until his death in 2004, as well as one of the most acclaimed contemporary scholars of Boccaccio. He was a man with strong religious roots during the Second World War who participated in the partisan struggle.  Biography  Vittore Branca was born in Savona in 1913 but spent much of his childhood on Lake Como. After graduating from the classical high school \\"Gabriello Chiabrera\\" in Savona, in 1931 he attended the entrance examination at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. In those years it became part of the FUCI. As a sign of protest, young Branca appeared before the examination committee wearing the badge of Catholic Action, whose youth circles were suppressed by the fascist regime. On this occasion he has his first encounter with John Gentile, who became his master. He graduated in 1935 with the highest grades. Two years later, he was in Florence to collaborate with the Accademia della Crusca at the national edition of Boccaccio's works. He began to teach in high schools. In July 1943 he took part in the work that led to the drafting of the Code of Camaldoli. After the arrest of Mussolini (executed two days after completing the Code), Branca actively collaborated with Resistance. His cordial relations with Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini and by mediation of these with Alcide De Gasperi made him a prominent member of Florentine anti-fascism, enabling him to represent the Catholic area of resistance in the direction Tuscan CNL. In 1944 he was contacted by Gentile, then president of the Academy of Italy, who invited him to collaborate \\"for homeland charity\\" in the New Anthology magazine. Branca, in spite of the profound connection with the philosopher, refused the offer, deciding to continue the struggle against Nazi-fascism. Gentile was killed by some partisans in April of the same year. In August, Branca participated in the dramatic events of the Florence uprising, which led to the liberation of the city. During the years of the formation of the Republic, De Gasperi proposed him as deputy secretary of the Christian Democracy. Branca declined the invitation to actively engage in academic studies and career. Between 1944 and 1949 he taught at the University of Florence and the faculty of Magisterium \\"Maria Assunta\\" in Rome. In 1949 he founded the magazine Italian Letters together with Giovanni Getto. From 1952 to 1953 he was in Paris, as a visiting professor at the Sorbonne University. In 1953 he began his career at the University of Padua, to which he would remain bound throughout his life. In the same year he joined the Board of Directors of the Giorgio Cini Foundation, from Venice, from 1972 to 1995 he was vice president and then became president from 1995 to 1996. Between 1968 and 1972 he was rector of the University of Bergamo. In 1968 he chaired an authoritative committee to establish the \\"Institute of Foreign Language and Literature\\" at the university. Until 1970, he collaborated on several occasions with UNESCO. He died in Venice on May 28, 2004 at the age of 91. In Padua he was dedicated to the \\"circulating library\\" and the adjoining hall- studio of via Portello. He left his library as a special fund at the Library of the Normal Superiore School.  Education and academic activities  Branca's contributions to Boccaccio's research were fundamental. In 1962 he identified Hamilton 90 as a precious autograph of Decameron, written by Boccaccio around 1370. In 1998, he discovered a manuscript made under Boccaccio's personal supervision, also of the Decameron, conceived in the mid- fifties of the 1300s and formally drawn up in 1360. Branca's studies have also influenced the philological field.

Giuseppe Adani, Correggio pittore universale, Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. It and Allegory of Virtue were painted as a pair for the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, with Vice probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for Vice, unlike Virtue, for which several preparatory studies survive, along with a near-complete under-drawing ‚Äì this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of Virtue. Mauro Lucco (ed), Mantegna a Mantova 1460-1506, exhibition catalogue, Skira Milano, 2006 Influenced by the Laocoon (as is Correggio's treatment of Saint Roch in his San Sebastiano Madonna and Four Saints), the central male figure is sometimes identified as a personification of Vice but sometimes as Silenus (possibly from Virgil's Eclogues 6, where a sleeping Silenus is tied up by the shepherds Chromi and Marsillo and forced to sing by them and the nymph Egle) or Vulcan. It was even misidentified as Apollo and Marsyas by the writer of the Gonzaga collection inventory of 1542. This misunderstanding may have contributed to an Apollo and Marsyas (actually by the studio or circle of Bronzino) being historically misattributed to Correggio. The putto in the foreground is influenced by Raphael's putti in the Sistine Chapel. In 1542, after Isabella's death, they were both recorded as hanging on either side of the entrance door \\"in the Corte Vecchia near the grotto\\", with Vice on the left and Virtue on the right. After the contents of her studiolo were dispersed, it remained in Mantua at least until 1627, but the following year it was sold to Charles I of Great Britain. After his execution it was purchased by cardinal Mazarin in 1661 and later by the banker Everhard Jabach, who later sold it to Louis XIV in Paris, reuniting it with Virtue.

At one point the company owned an array of other businesses including property development, power cables and ceramics and a five-star hotel before shedding businesses as part of a restructuring plan from heavy debt accumulated during its rapid expansion. It is one of the main industrial groups in Zouping County, one of the richest counties in the country. History The company's rapid growth has depended on generous availability of corporate debt. Through heavy borrowing the company was able to expand its aluminum production operations and enter other lines of business. By 2012, Qixing would reach its apex. The group company was then made up of 15 operating companies and seven subsidiaries with revenue 15 billion RMB ($2.3 billion) and had 12,000 employees. These businesses included Qixing Iron Tower, a Shenzhen Stock Exchange listed subsidiary, that manufactured transmission towers. Years later Zeng Libin, the president of the China Aluminum Association, would say \\"Qixing expanded blindly\\" during this period of easy credit and expansion. From its peak, the company would have to sell assets to repay debt as its financial situation deteriorated. The company's interest in Qixing Iron Tower (later renamed Northcom Group) was sold to the Longyue Group in December 2014. The Qixing Group was at the center of a local financial crisis in Shandong in 2017 based on a web of cross guarantees between the company and other local companies in Zouping County. A total of 10 billion RMB in loans had been advanced to the company and other local companies with the borrowers guaranteeing the debt of the others. In April 2017 the company defaulted on a repayment of seven billion RMB triggering fears of reverberations in the local financial system. However, the repayment was made a few days after the default, restoring calm in the market. As part of a local government orchestrated restructuring plan, the Xiwang Group took over the company and guaranteed its debts in April 2017.

Padhanagharas became popular and developed into large scale complexes during the latter part of Anuradhapura period. Western monasteries at Anuradhapura, Ritigala, Arankele, and Veherakanda are examples of this type of monasteries. All Padhanaghara buildings, found in Sri Lanka have followed a typical plan, consisting two raised platforms (Pasada and Malaka) built on a rock outcrop surrounded by a shallow artificial stream or a moat. The two platforms made out of well dressed blocks of stones are linked to each other by a narrow but large monolithic stone bridge spanning across the stream in- between. The outer platform is usually larger than the inner platform and open to the sky while the inner platform has provisions for meditation house. Although the buildings are not decorated with any carvings and sculptures, urinal and lavatory stones have been built with ornate carvings.

In 1957, the first Almetievsk-Gorky oil pipeline with the diameter of 500 mm was laid in Chuvashia. An emergency brigade was organized for the maintenance of the pipeline located in the village of Vtorye Toyzy (now part of Konarskoe Rural Settlement). By 1960, a pumping station and a substation were built. Unit No. 2 was installed and started its operation on March 6, 1961 for pumping oil. On March 28, 1961, order No. 34 was issued on the formation of NPS Tingovatovo (Tingovatovo Oil Pumping Station). Mikhailov Fyodor Mikhailovich was the first head of NPS Tingovatovo. At the current location of Konar there was forest with the same name, and a field. By the autumn of 1961 the construction of a residential complex was completed: 15 two-family houses from slag blocks. The village was named after the neighbouring forest. Until 1965, the settlement was mostly inhabited only by the station workers with their families. From the first days of foundation of the settlement, there were such organizations as the cultural centre (SDK), kindergarten, elementary school, shop, post office, bathhouse (banya). The nearest hospital was twenty kilometers away. In 1966 a district hospital was opened in the renovated barracks for builders. In 1972, road construction of 9 km with access to the highway was completed. Now there are regular buses running between Konar and the capital city of Cheboksary. In December 1979, Konar secondary school was opened. In 1992, a new cultural centre for 360 seats with a gymnasium was opened. Gradually, other institutions were founded, such as a distributing unit (gas pipeline), Tingovatovo (oil pumping station), AGRES (automatic gas distributor), veterinary station, bakery (currently out of operation - 2017), post office, telephone communication centre.  Leisure and Everyday Life  Residents of the settlement are engaged in various sports. There is a volleyball section for all categories of residents. There are skiing events, for example, \\"Ski Track of Russia\\", sports days for district schools. The cultural centre (SDK) organizes cultural events, such as celebration of the New Year, Farewell to Winter, festive concerts, Village Day, etc. In the evening, leisure activities are organized in SDK: billiards, table tennis, interest clubs. There is a library, which also organizes literature events and competitions. The majority of inhabitants have personal plots and subsidiary farms.

Traces of War  On the territory of the state farm \\"Sputnik\\", not far from the villages of Imburti and Toyzy of the Tsivilsky District (during the years of the war - Oktyabrsky District), on February 11, 1944 a military aircraft of American manufacture \\"Aerocobra\\" crashed in the forest. 35 years after the accident, students of the secondary school under the guidance of the historian and teacher Pavlov Averkiy Nikolaevich and Pavlova Lidia Mikhailovna studied the causes of the death of the aircraft and ascertained the personality of the pilot. Nine fighter aircraft of the brand \\"Aerocobra\\" from the 20th reserve aviation regiment, based in the city of Sverdlovsk, flew out of the airfield and headed for Ivanovo. This was the task of the State Defense Committee to deliver Lend- Lease fighters for the needs of the front. One of the aircraft did not reach its goal. The pilot of the crashed plane, Ermakov Mikhail Alexandrovich, is buried in the cemetery of Vtorye Toyzy. A monument to the Unknown Soldier is erected in the settlement. On Victory Day, schoolchildren annually lay a wreath at it, honoring the memory of the soldiers who never returned from the front.

Giuseppe Adani, Correggio pittore universale, Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. It and Allegory of Vice were painted as a pair for the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, with Vice probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for Vice, unlike Virtue, for which two preparatory studies survive (in the Louvre), along with a near-complete oil sketch (attributed to Correggio in the 1603 inventory of the Aldobrandini collection and now at the Galleria Doria Pamphili) - this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of Virtue.

(Others have interpreted the figure as Isabella herself, dressed as Wisdom.) Glory hovers above her holding a crown, whilst a seated female figure to the right is surrounded by symbols of the four cardinal virtues (a snake in her hair for Prudence, a sword for Justice, reins for temperance and Hercules's lion skin for Fortitude). Some interpret the seated black female figure on the right as Astrology, Science or Intellectual Virtue - she points outside the painting's space and thus (like the putto in Vice) draws the viewer's attention from one painting to the other. After the studiolo's contents was dispersed, Virtue and the Mantegna were given to cardinal Richelieu around 1627 and moved to Paris. There they were acquired by Eberhard Jabach in 1671, before being sold by him to Louis XIV - Virtue still hangs in the Louvre.

She held leadership positions across a wide range of organisations in Victoria. She served as president of the National Council of Women of Australia from 1948 to 1953. Early life Deakin was born on 14 July 1883 in South Yarra, Victoria, the eldest of three daughters born to Pattie (Browne) and Alfred Deakin. Her father became the second prime minister of Australia, serving three terms between 1903 and 1910. Based on the frequency of her appearances in his diary, Alfred Deakin's biographer Judith Brett has speculated that Ivy was his favourite child. The Deakin sisters were initially tutored by their aunt Catherine Deakin, before going on to attend Melbourne Girls Grammar. Music In 1901, Deakin began studying singing and violin at The Conservatorium of Music. She gained a diploma in 1903 and won the prestigious Ormond Scholarship in 1904, but had to relinquish it upon her marriage the following year. She was first violin in George Marshall-Hall's orchestra from 1903 to 1913, and maintained an interest in music for the rest of life. In 1926, she was appointed to the faculty of music at the University of Melbourne. She remained a member until 1969, sometimes as its only female member. She was also a foundation vice-president of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra's ladies' committee. Marriage and children Ivy Deakin in her wedding dress in 1905 The Deakin family attended the Australian Church, a liberal congregational church run by Charles Strong. In 1905, aged 21, Ivy married Herbert Brookes, a 37-year-old widower and friend of the family who had previously been married to Strong's daughter. They had three children together: *Sir Wilfred Deakin Brookes (1906‚Äì1997), RAAF officer and businessman. *Jessie Deakin Clarke (1914‚Äì2014), pioneer social worker, executive director of the Victorian Refugee Emergency Council. Married Tony Clarke, son of Sir Frank Clarke. *Alfred Deakin Brookes (1920‚Äì2005), intelligence officer, first head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service Community work Brookes was involved with a wide range of organisations, and according to The Sydney Morning Herald was \\"never merely a figurehead or a sleeping partner in any enterprise with which she allows her name to be associated\\". One of her most enduring associations was with the Royal Women's Hospital, as a member of the hospital board for 50 years. In 1915, Brookes became the founding president of the Housewives Co-operative Association (later the Housewives Association of Victoria), which promoted thrift and cooperativism to combat the rising cost of living during World War I. She lived in Washington, D.C., from 1929 to 1931, during her husband's service as Commissioner-General to the United States. Upon her return she reported on American child welfare practices to the Children's Welfare Association of Victoria. After all her children reached school age, Brookes was able to increased her public activity. She was the founder of the International Club of Victoria (1933‚Äì1958), and also held executive office in the Victorian branches of the Bureau of Social and International Affairs, the League of Nations Union, and United Nations Association. In 1937, she represented Australia at the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva, as the only woman in the Australian delegation. Brookes was elected as a justice of the peace in 1934. She was the inaugural vice-president of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, from 1936 to 1966, and was a foundation member of the University of Melbourne's boards of physical education (1938‚Äì1970) and social studies (1941‚Äì1967). Political involvement Brookes shared many of her father's political beliefs, as did her husband. As an able public speaker and political organiser, she became \\"her father's most valuable lieutenant in organising women for the liberal cause\\". In 1909, she became the honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP), an organisation which Deakin had founded to support the \\"Fusion\\" Liberal Party he created in federal parliament. The CLP was later absorbed into the People's Liberal Party, where she held a similar position. Brookes was active in policy formation, presenting policy papers on equal pay for equal work, \\"national social insurance\\", \\"delinquent parents\\", and the role of women in politics. In 1913, she attended a forum chaired by Vida Goldstein, and seconded a motion calling for the federal government to implement equal pay for equal work. Brookes campaigned for the \\"Yes\\" vote during the 1916 and 1917 referendums on conscription, embarking on \\"an ambitious public speaking trail\\" in country Victoria. After the creation of the Nationalist Party in 1917, she also held leadership roles in the National Union and National Federation. However, she suspended her active involvement in politics after her father's death in 1919. In 1925, Brookes returned to politics as a substitute for her ill husband, organising finances and election material at the 1925 federal election. Her liberal views had previously brought her into conflict with the more conservative Australian Women's National League (AWNL), but she eventually joined the league and became a vice-president. She assisted Elizabeth Couchman in bringing the AWNL into the new Liberal Party of Australia in 1944, and became one of its founding members and \\"a matriarch of the party that she and Herbert regarded as the philosophical heir of her father's\\". National Council of Women Brookes was first elected to the executive of the National Council of Women of Victoria in 1912. She was re-elected to the executive in 1934, then elected vice-president in 1936 and president in 1938. She was one of the Australian delegates at the International Council of Women's 50th anniversary conference, held in Scotland in 1938. As a delegate to the National Council of Women of Australia (NCWA), Brookes chaired its press, arts and letters and peace and international relations committees for a number of years. She was elected national president in 1948, serving until 1953. During her term as president, the organisation lobbied for equal pay and abolition of the marriage bar, and advocated for the interests of migrants and indigenous people. Brookes represented the organisation at the 1951 national inflation conference and as a member of the Advisory Committee on Import Licensing Control. She was appointed a life vice-president of the NCWA at the end of her term as president.

His character of \\"mirror of princes\\" and \\"mirror of citizens\\" has been pointed out by all scholars. He explains things that really happened and that he saw and lived. Muntaner often uses \\"I was there\\", which underlines his role as a witness, and provides data to help know the time of James I. The Catalan writer and investigator, Ferran Soldevila has been one of the main interpreters of the work of this medieval chronicler and his praise is quite eloquent.  Author  Ramon Muntaner was born in Peralada in 1265. He was the son of a remarkable family that hosted Jaume I the Conqueror (in 1274, Jaume I went to the Second Council of Lyon and sojourned in the Castle of Peralada with Alfonso X the Wise of Castile. This fact, which occurred when he was nine years old, was one of his most precious memories and he mentions this event with emotion in the Chronicle. In the same way that in the European novelist tradition (for example, Chr√©tien de Troyes ), it is exposed to us, how the vision of a great hero in the eyes of a child is capable of changing the course of his life. Muntaner says that the vision of James I when he was a child led him to devote himself as a writer explaining everything he had seen.. In 1285, Peralada was destroyed by the Almogavars during the Crusade against the Crown of Aragon and had to emigrate. When he was twenty, Ramon Muntaner took part in the conquest of Menorca ; Later, he participated in the fight against the French during the War of Sicily, in 1300 at the Siege of Messina, next to Roger de Flor and as the administrator of his company. In the summer of 1302, he began under the orders of this leader, the expedition to the East. In 1307, he left the company, and in 1311 he got married.. In 1315, he had to travel between Sicily and Roussillon, as he was in charge of a delicate mission: to transport from Catania to Perpignan an orphan baby, the future Jaume III of Mallorca, in order to deliver him to his grandparents. From that moment on, his memoirs were removed and matured for ten years, until he had a revealing \\"dream\\" that prompted him, in 1325, at the age of sixty, in Valencia, to start writing the Chronicle, which he finished three years later. Muntaner died in Ibiza in 1336  Work  Sertorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.Christian M√ºller in Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515‚Äì1532, Christian M√ºller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; et al, Munich: Prestel, 2006, , . Muntaner had a personal relationship with all the kings of the House of Aragon, the House of Mallorca and the House of Sicily belonging to the lineage of the Casal de Barcelona that were contemporary to him. In doing his work, he mainly resorted to historiographic texts for the reigns of James I and Peter the Great, and, from Alfons el Franc, his almost exclusive source is his own experience. The work was written to be read aloud. Whenever he addresses his \\"listeners\\", he usually calls them \\"lords\\". Muntaner managed to establish direct communication with his \\"listeners\\". For this, he uses joglaresque procedures (such as the question \\"What will I say?\\"), As well as using a live and colloquial language The fundamental objective of the work is to glorify the kings of the House of Aragon. The monarchism of our chronicler is closely related to providentialism and nationalism. The blood, a common destiny and the language (the beautiful catalanesc of the world ) are the elements that make up the base of the Catalan and Aragonese community. It is impossible to find in the whole of medieval Europe anything that resembles the \\"national\\" maturity of the Chronicle His life and adherence to the dynasty and the Catalan language, to which he expressed an extraordinary devotion, represent the counterweight to the centripetal forces within the Catalan national community resulting from the organization of conquered lands in new kingdoms (Mallorca, Valencia, Sicily) and, sometimes, the implantation of a new dynastic branch (Mallorca, Sicily). The awareness of the danger of division and the value of the union also explained it in its chronicle, especially in the example of the rush plant, \\"mata de jonc\\" in Catalan (Similar to the Sertorius horse tail example). With this work, Ram√≥n Muntaner also became the first author in the Catalan language to capture the aspirations of a large part of the Catalan elite for an Iberian political reunification, as he commented on Ariza's interview between the monarchs of the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castile, in which the latter proposed to Peter the Great an alliance between them, the king of Portugal and the king of Mallorca, Muntaner added: \\"... And, assuredly, he spoke the truth; if these four Kings of Spain whom he named, who are of one flesh and blood, held together, little need they fear all the other powers of the world...\\" (.\\"..si aquests quatre reys que ell nomenava d'Espanya, qui s√≥n una carn e una sang, se teguessen ensemps, poch duptare tot laltre poder del m√≥n.\\").Muntaner's Chronicle-p.206, L.Goodenough-Hakluyt- London-1921Margarit i Pau, Joan: Paralipomenon Hispaniae libri decem. Cervantes Virtual; f. LXXXIIIv.  Contrast between the Chronicle of Muntaner and the Chronicle of Pachymeres  Regarding the Catalan Company of the East, Ramon Muntaner began to write his chronicle in 1325, that is, 17 years after the Byzantine Greek George Pachymeres wrote his work De Michaele et Andronico Pal√¶ologis. While the work of Pachymeres offers the Greek vision of the facts, emphasizing the atrocities committed by the Company and Roger de Flor until 1308, the Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner is the only western source that relates the events experienced by the Catalan Company of The Orient. In some aspects, the work of Ramon Muntaner becomes, not only a glorification of Roger de Flor and the Company, but also a counter-narrative of the work of Pachymeres, relating some facts that the Greek does not mention, and eluding to explain facts that the Greek author does report in detail. Some of these facts would be: * Massacre of the Genoese : Pachymeres affirms that the origin of the massacre began as a result of a debt that Roger de Flor had not settled with the Genoese, while Muntaner did not explain why the confrontations originated. * Battle of Germe : despite being a minor battle, Muntaner does not comment anything. * Executions summary of Germe: Pachymeres explains the barbarism of Roger de Flor in wanting to execute the Greek military who had surrendered the fortress to the Turks, accusing them of cowardice. Muntaner does not comment anything. * Summary executions of Kula: Again, Pachymeres explains the barbarism of Roger de Flor in wanting to execute the Greek military who had rendered the fortress to the Turks, accusing them of cowardice. Muntaner does not comment anything. * War contributions to Philadelphia: Pachymeres explains that, after releasing the city of Philadelphia, Roger de Flor imposed on the city the payment of illegal and abusive war contributions. Muntaner does not comment anything. * War contributions to Ephesus: Pachymeres explains that, after Bernat de Rocafort met with Roger de Flor in Ephesus, he committed all kinds of atrocities to raise the payment of more war contributions. Muntaner does not comment anything. * The Siege of Magnesia : Pachymeres explains that the governor of Magnesia executed the almogavar garrison that was protecting the treasure of the Company and seized it, and then withstood the siege to which the Company underwent the city. Muntaner does not comment anything. * Figures: it is unknown in what source Muntaner was based when citing the number of the armies, the number of killed, wounded and captured people, which are always favorable to Roger de Flor and the Catalan East Company, which in fact is a truism for they stayed there from 1303 till 1390 being the Turkish uncapable to defeat them.  Codex and editions  Muntaner's work had great repercussions and diffusion during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and was used, for example, in various passages of Tirant lo Blanc by Joanot Martorell. It was edited for the first time in the sixteenth century, coinciding with a time of great revision of historiography; This first edition was commissioned and paid by the jurors of the city of Valencia. New printed editions took place during the 19th century, during the period of romantic exaltation of the European medieval past, even a translation into English made by the Hakluyt Society in 1920-21Muntaner's Chronicle-p.435, L.Goodenough- Hakluyt-London-1921  Codex  * Codex, 1325/1332: Codex A / Ms. K.I.6 = COD K-I-6 / f.1 Real Biblioteca de San Lorenzo de El Escorial.. * Codex, 1342: Manuscript n¬∫. 1803.

He was born in Cologne in the Holy Roman Empire but later naturalised as a French subject. Life His father had expanded the family fortune and founded a bank in Antwerp, then in the Spanish Netherlands. Everhard himself settled in France in 1638 and was naturalised as a French subject in 1647. In 1648 he married Anna Maria de Groote in Cologne ‚Äì she was a daughter of one of the city's senators and he had four children with her. Francis Haskell called him \\"an opulent banker\\", associated with a trading company based in Amsterdam and one of the directors of the French East India Company, managing the 'factory' at Corbeil. In 1671 his fortune was valued at 2 million livres. Now lost, his town house or 'h√¥tel particulier' was on rue Neuve-Saint-Merri ‚Äì he put on plays there, whose audiences included Voltaire, before it became the base of the \\"Caisse Jabach\\" Comptoir commercial.  Jabach collections  Jabach is most notable as a famous collector of drawings, paintings, sculptures, objets d'art, bronzes and prints by Raphael, the Caracci brothers, Rubens, Paul Bril, Durer, Le Brun and Poussin. They came from the Ludovisi collection in Italy, from the sales in the Netherlands of the collections of the Earl of Arundel after the death of his widow in 1654, and those in London of Charles I of England in 1650‚Äì1653, from other collections in Germany and from the dispersal of Rubens' estate. Some of his drawings originated in Vasari's noted Libro de' Disegni portfolio. In 1661‚Äì62 and 1671 he ceded much of his collection to Louis XIV ‚Äì a total of 5,000 drawings in the second sale, now in the Louvre's Cabinet des dessins. In 1741 Pierre-Jean Mariette stated that \\"in selling the King his paintings and drawings, [Jabach] held back some of the drawings, and certainly not the least beautiful ones\\".

He is one of the founders, a major shareholder, former chief executive and board chairman of Otkritie Holding, once the largest privately-held financial group in Russia, and as such the former major shareholder of Otkritie Bank.  Education and early career  Vadim Belyaev was born on 28 May 1966, in Moscow, into the family of Russian scientists, Stanislav Wolfson and Natalia Belyaeva. His father, Stanislav Wolfson, was an engineer, and well-known as an author of high school chemistry textbooks. Born Vadim Wolfson, with his father's surname, he later adopted his mother's. In 1989, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Radio Equipment, Electronics and Automation (MIREA), later re-named the Russian Technology University, with a degree in electronic acoustics and ultrasound engineering. After graduation, Belyaev was employed as a computer programmer at the Soviet shipbuilding ministry, following which he briefly worked as an IT-specialist for a private firm.https://bankir.ru/publikacii/20171027/zhizn-polnaya- otkrytii-10-faktov-o-vadime-belyaeve-10009277/ In 1995, Belyaev earned a degree in banking and insurance from the Russian government-sponsored Financial University in Moscow (FinU). He also holds a certificate in capital markets from the London-based Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment (CISI).  Business career  In 1992, Belyaev began to trade in the developing Russian securities market. The next year he set up a fund to trade in the recently issued Russian government privatization vouchers. Soon after, Belyaev joined Aura Bank in Moscow to lead and manage its securities trading department. In 1994 Aura Bank was reorganized as the Moscow Petrochemical Bank and Belyaev became the chief executive officer‚Äôs deputy. In 1995, Belyaev teamed up with some managers of the Moscow office of Italtel Ltd, an Italian telecommunication equipment producer, to launch an investment firm called VEO- Invest, investing principally in local telecommunications assets. In 1997, Belyaev became CEO at VEO-Invest and expanded the firm‚Äôs activities into wider brokerage services and financial consulting. Belyaev initially owned about 10% of VEO-Invest, but after the 1998 financial crisis in Russia, he bought out the other shareholders‚Äô stakes and became sole owner. In 2001, VEO-Invest and another brokerage, BK Otkritie, merged, resulting in the creation of VEO- Otkritie, of which Belyaev owned 75%. In 2004 Belyaev‚Äôs tennis partner, Russian businessman Boris Mints invested in VEO-Otkritie. The company rebranded as Investment Group Otkritie, later renamed Otkritie Holding. Belyaev remained as CEO and Mints became the chairman of the board of directors. In 2006 the partners bought a small local lender, Shchit (‚ÄúShield‚Äù) Bank, and renamed it Otkritie Bank. In 2007-2008, Otkritie worked with the Russian electricity grid monopoly RAO UES, which was undergoing reorganization and restructuring under the oversight of Anatoly Chubais, who had won international renown for his handling of privatization in post-Soviet Russia. According to The Financial Times, in 2008, state-controlled VTB bank provided Otkritie with a loan to set up a $2.4bn fund to trade shares of the smaller power utilities that split from RAO UES as a result of the reorganization. In 2009, the fund was sold to an offshore firm under the management of Xenon Capital Partners (an investment company set up by Natalia Tsukanova, the former head of JPMorgan‚Äôs investment banking in Russia). In a separate deal, VTB acquired a 20% stake in Otkritie in 2009 for approximately $150m. In 2012, Otkritie took over Nomos Bank, a top-ten Russian lender, using a $1bn loan provided by VTB. By this time, Boris Mints had already sold his shares, making Belyaev the largest stakeholder. Through numerous acquisitions and organic growth, by the end of 2015, Otkritie had evolved into Russia‚Äôs largest privately held bank, with total assets of 3.3 Trillion rubles (equal to US$49 billion at the time). In 2015, Belyaev resigned as CEO of Otkritie Holding to chair the board of directors and concentrate on strategic issues (under the Russian law, one person cannot simultaneously serve as the board chairman and the chief executive of the same entity). In late 2016 Otkritie initiated a takeover of Rosgosstrakh, the country‚Äôs largest insurer at the moment, which had suffered huge losses by then. The deal was initially suggested and later approved by the central bank. After the agreement was signed in December 2016, in the presence of the central bank‚Äôs chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina and her deputy Sergey Shvetsov, Otkritie launched a due diligence of Rosgosstrakh. The checkup revealed that the insurer‚Äôs problems were far greater than Otkritie had expected. In early July ACRA, the newly-established Russian credit rating agency, de-facto controlled by the central bank, unexpectedly gave Otkritie a junk rating. In August 2017, following the rating downgrade, Otkritie suffered a run on its deposits. On August 29, 2017, the Russian Central Bank intervened to take control. Dmitry Tulin, who was a deputy chairman at the central bank at the moment, admits that the intervention was basically triggered by the attempted takeover of Rosgosstrakh. In July 2019, the Central Bank and Otkritie Bank filed a civil law suit in Russian court against Belyaev and four other former senior executives of Otkritie Holding and Otkritie Bank for ‚Äúdamages‚Äù of 290bn rubles (over $4.5bn), allegedly incurred as a result of the Central Bank‚Äôs intervention. The Central Bank‚Äôs case does not assert any fraud or negligence by Belyaev; it simply seeks damages for ‚Äúmissed future gains‚Äù on the theory that its 2017 investment to shore-up Otkritie‚Äôs balance sheet is tantamount to a 20-year interest-free loan and that if the Central Bank‚Äôs funds were deployed instead to make interest-bearing loans, this would generate interest income equal to the claimed 290bn rubles through 2037. As of January 2020, the case was still at an early stage.  Media activities  In 2006-2007, Belyaev hosted a radio show on the Echo of Moscow radio station ‚Äî ‚ÄúVadim Belyaev‚Äôs Investor School‚Äù. In 2009, Belyaev founded movie studio Organic Films. The company produced popular comedies ‚ÄúWhat Men Talk About‚Äù (directed by Dmitry Dyachenko) and ‚ÄúChapiteau Show‚Äù (directed by Sergey Loban). In 2010, Belyaev bought online magazine OpenSpace.ru. In 2012, he initiated major strategic changes in the magazine‚Äôs mission and orientation, replacing the editorial team. To lead the new team, Belyaev brought in Maksim Kovalsky, the charismatic former editor-in-chief of popular political weekly Kommersant-Vlast. (Kovalsky had been dismissed from Kommersant-Vlast in December 2011, following the publication of detailed accusations of large- scale electoral fraud with a photograph of a ballot scrawled with profanity directed against Vladimir Putin, the then-prime minister). In 2013, the magazine was shut down for commercial reasons. According to The Financial Times, in 2011 Belyaev sponsored a Cirque de Soleil performance in Moscow. At the opening of the performance he encouraged the audience to join the protest rally against Russian President Vladimir Putin at Bolotnaya Square.  Philanthropy  Since 2011 Vadim Belyaev has been a major supporter of the first specialised paediatric palliative care centre in Moscow, established by the Vera charity foundation. According to the founder of the Vera charity foundation, Nyuta Federmesser, Vadim Belyaev was the first to donate money and he also helped raise more funds. Nyuta Federmesser praised Vadim Belyaev‚Äôs efforts to persuade the municipal government of Moscow to allocate the land and building for the hospice.  Awards  Belyaev was twice named the Investment Banker of the Year in Russia. He has been repeatedly included in the list of the country‚Äôs top thousand best managers by the Kommersant business daily.  Personal life  In 2019, Belyaev married Olga Liubimova, former journalist and founder of Fotodom agency. He was married twice before, with a daughter from his first marriage and a son and two daughters with his second wife, Amalia Mordvinova, a well-known Russian actress.

Biography Nicholas was born in a small thatched house near Trefgarn chapel, not far from Solva, Pembrokeshire. He was educated at Lancashire College, Manchester, and at G√∂ttingen in Germany, where he took the degree of PhD. He became a Presbyterian minister, and served at Stroud, Gloucestershire and at Eignbrook, Herefordshire. In 1856, he was appointed professor of biblical literature and mental and moral science at the Presbyterian College at Carmarthen. In 1863 he settled in London, resigning his professorship, and thenceforth, with the aid of Sir Hugh Owen, Lord Aberdare, Archdeacon Griffiths, Rev. David Thomas (editor of the Homilist), and others, he promoted a scheme for the furtherance of higher education in Wales on non-sectarian principles, and became the secretary of the movement. He subsequently disagreed with others of the promoters, and had resigned from the committee before the scheme came to fruition. As a result of these efforts, the University College of Wales was founded in 1872, when a building at Aberystwyth was purchased. Nicholas is said to have secured promises of subscriptions amounting to ¬£14,000. He was one of the governors and drew out a scheme of education. He had made a special study of the educational institutions of France and Germany. He died unmarried at 156 Cromwell Road, London, on 14 May 1879. Writings Besides pamphlets and other publications, Nicholas was the author of: * Middle and High Class Schools, and University Education for Wales, 1863, a work which exerted great influence on educated Welshmen. * Pedigree of the English People, 1868; 5th edit. 1878. * Annals and Antiquities of the Counties and County Families of Wales, 1872, in 2 vols. * History and Antiquities of the County of Glamorgan and its Families, 1874. * He edited, with notes and a biographical sketch, Mathias Maurice's Social Religion Exemplify'd, 1860, 8vo. * In late 1878, he revised the English edition of Baedeker's London as it passed through the press. * He projected a History of Wales, which he did not live to complete.

L. Lucas. It purports to be an account, written in 1814 by a Scottish minister of the Kirk in middle age and published posthumously, of his youthful bewitchment by Elspeth Buchan and of the time he spent in the 1780s among the Buchanites. First published in 1937, it was Lucas's second historical novella, the first being The Wild Tulip (1932); he had also published a prize-winning historical novel, C√©cile (1930). Plot summary The narrator, John McHaffie, the bookish 16-year-old son of a schoolmaster in Irvine, Ayrshire, \\"an overwrought lad and a Johnny-head-in- air\\",Lucas, F. L., The Woman Clothed with Sun, and Other Stories (London, 1937), p.72 is loved by sensible Jenny Traquair, also 16, an orphan fostered in the McHaffie household. After an account of his childhood, the narrator describes the stir caused in his town in 1782‚Äì3 by the fanatical preaching in the Relief Church of the new minister, Hugh White, a fearsome \\"false Elijah\\" who has danced among the Shakers of Mother Ann Lee in America. White brings from Glasgow Elspeth Buchan, 44, the self-proclaimed 'Woman Clothed with the Sun' of Revelation. At first John joins the Irvine rabble in persecuting Elspeth and the Buchanites, a revivalist sect who believe they are the elect living in the Last Days, shortly to be translated en bloc to Heaven without tasting death. In reality John is secretly fascinated by Buchan's teaching that wedlock is now abolished and that men and women may couple freely. Elspeth one day finds him spying, asks him why he persecutes her, takes his hands in hers and quotes some erotic lines from The Song of Songs. He is struck by her fine eyes, coils of black hair and queenly bearing. \\"I read deep in Revelation and Daniel, till my wits were completely upside down.\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.91 His obsession grows when he sees her dragged out of town by the mob, \\"her clothes rent to ribbons\\", her \\"white shoulders shining in the torchlight\\". Common-sense Jenny, alarmed, tries reason and mockery to cure him of his interest in this \\"doited auld ale-wife\\".The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.93 On a chance errand, John overtakes the exiles on their way (1785) into the wilderness, to, as they believe, \\"a place prepared of God, for a time, and times, and half a time\\". Elspeth takes him to one side, again quotes Scripture (\\"Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; also our bed is green\\") and kisses him. Jenny later rounds on him as a \\"daft young lad beglammered by an auld spaewife might be his ain grandmither\\".The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.95 A few weeks later a letter arrives from Elspeth inviting John to join the Society in its new commune in Dumfriesshire. Believing the world about to end, John opens his Bible at random: :The first time I opened, I read: \\"And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azov.\\" This did not greatly guide me, so I tried a second time and found: \\"And they removed from Benejaahan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad. And they went from Hor-hagidgad and pitched in Jotbathah.\\" Here again I did not feel much enlightened. So I tried a third time and opened the Book, as it happened, at First Thessalonians, fifth and nineteenth: \\"Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things.\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.96 He steals away and joins the sect in the hills of Galloway. He finds its members \\"blithe as bees to work in the morning, blithe as bees when they returned at night,\\" in the fullness of their faith that Heaven's gates stand already ajar.The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.98 He perceives that they do indeed couple freely as the beasts that perish.The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.101 Elspeth wastes little time in initiating the narrator, now 18. Next morning he feels bitterly that he has been false to Jenny; he would not like to think of her in such company. Among the faithful is Jean Gardner, \\"loveliest of lasses ... with great coils of auburn hair\\", whom \\"that ungodly young poet\\" Robert Burns had tried to lure from the sect.The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.99 John notes many underhand infringements of the Society's rules by its male leaders. He describes the preparations for Ascension, as the \\"time for our translation heavenward was near at hand\\" : the forty-day fast, barricaded in their barn, and the sufferings it brings; the mockery of the locals; the desertion of one of their number and her calling in of the magistrates to save her starving children. Jenny meanwhile devises a stratagem to rescue John. She tells the Irvine magistrates (falsely) that John McHaffie made her pregnant before running off to join the Buchanites. He is summonsed and brought home; but in a few days he escapes and returns to the Society, just in time to witness the abortive Ascension on midsummer's dawn ‚Äì a failure put down by Elspeth to lack of faith. Months pass. The faithful (some forty) struggle on at a new location in Kirkcudbrightshire. John, his belief gone, stays on out of pity for and loyalty to Elspeth. Elspeth falls ill and dies. Hugh White buries her in secret and, producing proofs, tells her disciples that the body has been swept up to Heaven. John, disgusted, searches in secret for her grave. He discovers instead the graves of unwanted babies born to the sect. He is \\"resolved that this imposture should now finish\\" and calls in Sir Alexander Gordon, Sheriff of Kirkcudbright. In a torchlight scene, Sir Alexander forces Hugh White to disinter Elspeth's coffin. John surprises the gravediggers and accuses White, who defends himself: \\"Ye fool, canna ye understand that I could ill-use her and yet love her? That I couldna bear to see her shamed before the world? That they all should know, as I know now, that she was but a puir mortal body like us a' ?\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.127 Sir Alexander cautions White against further jugglery and advises him to return to America. The novella ends with Jenny arriving to ask John to come home. In a coda we learn that the narrator returned to Irvine, took Sir Alexander's advice to go up to University of Edinburgh to read Theology, married Jenny (who vets his sermons before he preaches them), settled down as Minister of the Kirk, and dedicated his first sermon to Love. Themes The narrative is John HcHaffie's \\"warning ... (particularly to young callants [lads] puffed up with a little learning) against enthusiasm and false prophets and headstrong wrestings of the Scriptures\\".The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.71 \\"I saw clearly now,\\" he writes, \\"that once false faiths begin, none can say how they will end\\".The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.120 A secondary theme is that sons may react negatively to the virtues of their fathers, so that \\"through the contrariness of our fallen nature, the bairns might oft times have been better, had their parents been less good.\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.72 (David McHaffie, who embodies 18th-century rationalism, is \\"a dour man who loved his duty above all else\\".The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.73) Commonsense Jenny (\\"as makes a man understand why the heathen Greeks made Wisdom itself a woman\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.79) is contrasted with Elspeth, whom the narrator nevertheless portrays sympathetically: \\"Truly (and it is some excuse for me) she was no ordinary woman.\\" The Woman Clothed with Sun, p.85 The rabble who persecute her, and the hypocrites within the sect, are more obviously condemned. Background At the end of his Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal (1936) Lucas had expressed dissatisfaction with the role of literary critic that had established his reputation. According to his American publisher, he planned to turn increasingly to historical fiction to give expression to his beliefs and political convictions.Dust-wrapper, The Woman Clothed with the Sun, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1938 After the cool reception of his novel Doctor Dido (1938), however, he turned instead to history-based poetry,Lucas, F. L., From Many Times and Lands: Poems of Legend and History (London 1953) not writing another novel till his retirement ‚Äì The English Agent: A Tale of the Peninsular War (1969). Reception J. D. Beresford in the Manchester Guardian said of The Woman Clothed with the Sun, \\"The manner of writing is that proper to the period, with a spicing of dialect, both so admirably rendered that we might easily be deceived into the belief that it is an authentic document.\\" Manchester Guardian, 13 Aug. 1937, p.5 \\"As a pastiche it is brilliant,\\" noted The Times Literary Supplement; \\"but if Scott or Stevenson had written the same story the 'something' missing in this\\" [inspiration] \\"would have been abundantly present\\".The Times Literary Supplement, August 1937 Forrest Reid in The Spectator found it a \\"delightful\\" account of Elspeth Buchan and her followers. \\"Mr Lucas can be amusing and at the same time very much in earnest. His method is ironic.\\" Forrest Reid in The Spectator, 20 August 1937, p.326 The Scotsman praised the author's \\"fine sense of drama, remarkable powers of description, and admirable sense of style\\".Advert in The Times Literary Supplement, August 1937 Of the book as a whole Beresford wrote, \\"The stories have a forcible intellectual quality that makes them a real pleasure to read,\\" while Time and Tide opined: \\"This sombre collection of brilliantly written stories will be a good choice for people who are consoled by the thought that the world never has been up to much.\\" Tullis Clare in Time and Tide, 14 August 1937, p.1100 Publishing history The novella was the title-story and longest (at some 25,000 words) in a collection of ten, published in 1937 by Cassell and Company of London and in 1938 by Simon & Schuster of New York, as The Woman Clothed with Sun, and Other Stories.

Hollywood Ten: On May 29, 1947, she reported the beginning of the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings of 30 Hollywood stars, ten of whom (the \\"Hollywood Ten\\") refused to answer questions members including Nixon and who received contempt of Congress indictments. 1948 Progressive Party Convention: Spargo went to Philadelphia, where on July 22 she reported on the lead-up to the 1948 Progressive National Convention that nominated former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace against the Harry S. Truman (Democrats), Strom Thurmond (Dixiecrats), and Thomas E. Dewey (Republicans). \\"Peace‚Äìpeace and security‚Äìthat's the slogan of the self-styled Gideon's army gathered here. \\"Caravans for Wallace\\" drove around the city with drawings on their sides of the Democratic donkey and Republican elephant going around the \\"same old merry-go-round\\" under the banner of Wall Street. Woody Guthrie was on-hand to sing his tune from the People's Song book, \\"The Wallace-Taylor Train\\" (a take on his Almanac Singers tune \\"The Farmer-Labor Train,\\" itself a take-off on famed folksong \\"The Wabash Cannonball\\"). Press kits included a \\"natty postcard\\" which shows Truman on piano and Dewey draped over it (\\"Lauren Bacall style\\") while they sing \\"Blest Be the Tie Binds\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" Hiss Case: In 1948, Spargo reported on the testimony of Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers, who alleged that some half-dozen former federal government officials had formed a Soviet spy network that he ran, one of whom was Alger Hiss. After the first appearances of both Chambers and Hiss before the House Un-American Activities Committee, after which Hiss appeared more trustworthy, Spargo counseled Richard Nixon that, if his hunch was wrong and he pursued Hiss further through Chambers, Nixon would be a \\"dead duck.\\" She also warned him that \\"This case is going to kill the Committee unless you can prove Chambers' story.\\" FBI Informant: During the hearings of William Remington (accused of Soviet espionage by Elizabeth Bentley, Remington's wife suggested that he give an exclusive statement to Spargo because she had once worked for the House Un-American Activities Committee. Remington's wife was hoping also that Spargo could advise him on what to do. Remington spoke to Spargo to give her a preview of his upcoming press conference that evening at the Willard Hotel: it was a diatribe against Congress. Spargo cautioned him that with such statement would \\"crucify himself.\\" The approach she counseled included praise for the committee and for Bentley. His only connection to Communism came through marriage that gave him a relationship to Joseph North (writer), long-time managing editor of the New Masses magazine in the 1930s. While at the Post, she served as vice president of the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. After she left the Post, sh worked for the American Red Cross and Daughters of the American Revolution, for the latter of which she worked as head of public relations. In 1958, she moved to Albany, where she worked for the 'Albany Times Union and the government of the State of New York. In 1977, she retired. Personal and death Spargo married William Sherman Pryor. They had one daughter. They divorced. She died age 84 of a heart attack at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, New York.

These stelai mark the burial sites of the Mycenaean dead, much like modern headstones. At least 21 stelai have been discovered from Grave Circle A, with 12 having identifiable relief sculpture. Most were upright, rectangular slabs of oolithic limestone, ranging in date from 1600 to 1500 BCE. The iconography depicted on these stelai include chariot scenes, hunting scenes, and circular and spiral designs characteristic of the Greek Mycenaean Period. Scholars argue that these scenes demonstrate the prevalence of warfare in Mycenaean culture, in addition to signifying a socially stratified society.  Description  thumb Grave Stele I, \\"Simile,\\" from Grave Circle A, Mycenae. Currently on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. All 21 stelai found at Grave Circle A were cut from oolithic limestone, a material used in many other Mycenaean constructions. Many of these stelai just survive in fragments, though most are rectangular in shape. To incise the stelai, Mycenaean artists carved out the background of a previously sketched image, creating a raised relief. Tools, such as the compass, and templates were likely used to carve the sculptures. Scholars also speculate that the stelai might have been painted. Most of the iconography consists of geometric motifs, including circles and spirals. Figural imagery, including chariot scenes with humans and large animals like horses and lions, also appear on the stelai. The stelai are stylistically similar to the grave stelai found at Grave Circle B, but neither groups of stelai resemble similar pieces created by Minoans.  Carved Stelai  * Stele I, or the \\"Simile\\" stele, consists of a central scene framed by two columns of spiral motifs. The center depicts a man in a chariot directing a horse running over a man, possibly armored, lying down. Below the chariot scene, a lion is depicted chasing a quadruped animal. * Stele II, or the \\"Wellenband\\" stele, consists of three carved columns, the outside of which depict a curving, meander motif, potentially resembling a snake. * Stele III, or the \\"Spirals\\" stele, consists of four vertical columns containing spiral motifs, with circles carved in between spirals. * Stele IV, or the \\"Cartoon\\" stele, consists of three horizontal panels of sculpture, with the top and bottom panels containing spiral motifs. The middle panel depicts a chariot scene, with a man driving the chariot and another man before the chariot with a possible weapon. * Stele V, or the \\"Over the Sea\\" stele, consists of two horizontal panels of sculpture, with the top panel containing a spiral motif. The bottom panel depicts a man in a chariot, directing a horse with reins, with a secondary male figure on the right of the scene, carrying a possible weapon. Grave Stele V, \\"Over the Sea,\\" from Grave Circle A, Mycenae. Currently on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. * Stele VI, or the \\"Horsey\\" stele, consists of a frame of spiral motifs, with a central panel containing four rearing horses, stacked on top of one another. * Stele VII is mostly fragmentary, but contains spiral motifs and the head of a horse. * Stele VIII is also mostly fragmentary, but contains spiral motifs, a wheel, the head of a possible charioteer, and the hoof of a possible horse. * Stele IX contains another chariot scene with spiral motifs. * Stelai X, XI, and XII exist in fragments, and could theoretically belong to the same stele. Heads of horses and humans, as well as potential feet can be seen on these stele fragments.  Meaning  Since chariots were a common aspect of Bronze Age warfare in the Near East and Egypt, scholars have often speculated that the chariot scenes depicted on these grave stelai (Specifically I, IV, V, and VIII) evidence a culture which places heavy importance on warfare. However, other scholars doubt this interpretation, as Greece's mountainous terrain would make chariots difficult to use in warfare. Another argument determines that the main function of these grave stelai is to be status symbols, with \\"heroic\\" imagery. They argue that the presence of opulent grave goods in the graves marked by the stelai further supports this interpretation. Since only six shaft graves were located in Grave Circle A, many scholars, such as John G. Younger, speculate why there were so many stelai in relation to burial sites. Younger concludes that the stelai do not refer to any specific burial, but instead represent a collective of the bodies buried in Circle A. However, Giampaolo Graziadio suggests that graves might have more than one stele as a status indicator. The presence of so many stelai in Grave Circle A also distinguishes it from Grave Circle B. Furthermore, scholars use the iconography on the stelai to interpret the lives of the Mycenaean people. John G. Younger attempts to infer the gender of the deceased individual from the stelai designs, stating that while the chariot scenes likely refer to men, the geometric textile-like designs may refer to women. J.C. Wright uses the symbology present on the grave stelai to demonstrate changing mortuary practices from the Shaft Graves of the early Mycenaean period to the tholos tombs of the Late Mycenaean period. He says that the grave stele, a small marker emphasizing ties among the elite, were later replaced by the tholos tomb, a more outward and monumental form of burial practice. Therefore, scholars often use the images and function of these stelai to illuminate the cultural practices of the Mycenaeans themselves.

A small feature of the sanctuary as a whole, the heroon is a large mound of earth situated on the west side of the Nemea river. This site is dedicated to the mythological hero Opheltes, an infant whose death was foretold by the seer Amphiaraus. Though little remains of the activities of the heroon, it is suspected that the athletic games which took place there were the predecessor of the Nemean games, though this does contrast with the idea that Herakles created the games.Trckova-Flamee, Alena. ‚ÄúOpheltes.‚Äù Encyclopedia Mythica, 9 Dec. 2006, www.pantheon.org/articles/o/opheltes.html. Evidence of cult activities and the practicing of magic at the heroon have also been found.  The Heroon  Map of the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea; the Heroon is at location 7 The heroon itself is a mound of earth, long and at its widest. The heroon was likely at the height of its use from the 6th century B.C.E. to the 4th century B.C.E. but little remains from its earliest stages. Later construction of a five- sided peribolos wall and a general flattening of the mound have also altered the structure. The immediate surroundings of the heroon include an unlined well, a three-part reservoir, evidence of a hippodrome, remains of an athletic track, and the starting line of the early stadium. Many of these structures may have been built for use during the athletic events held in honor of the hero Opheltes.Miller, Stephen G. \\"Excavations at Nemea, 1997-2001.\\" Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, vol. 84, no. 2, Apr. 2015, pp. 277‚Äì353. JSTOR, doi:10.2972/hesperia.84.2.0277. The first Nemean Games were held in 573 B.C.E. and the heroon was constructed around the same time, however sources for the myth of Opheltes are traceable only to the early 5th century B.C.E.Bravo, Jorge J. ‚ÄúThe Hero Shrine of Opheltes/Archemoros at Nemea: A Case Study of Ancient Greek Hero Cult.‚Äù University of California, Berkeley, 2006, pp. 1‚Äì668. Therefore, it is likely the heroon predates the hero that it commemorates. In the mid third century B.C.E. when the games were relocated to Argos the shrine fell out of use.Bravo, Jorge J. ‚ÄúErotic Curse Tablets from the Hero√∂n of Opheltes at Nemea.‚Äù Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, vol. 85, no. 1, Jan. 2016, pp. 121‚Äì152. JSTOR, doi:10.2972/hesperia.85.1.0121.  The Cult of Opheltes  According to legend, Opheltes was the infant son of King Lycurus and his wife Eurydice of Nemea. His nurse was Hypsipyle, the former queen of the island of Lemnos who had been taken as a slave. Lycurus and Eurydice had been told by the seer Amphiaraus that their son could not be put down on the ground until he had learned to walk or else he would be killed, and the couple passed this directive onto the nurse. However, when the Seven against Thebes, on their way from Argos to Thebes, stopped at Nemea, they asked Hypsipyle to show them to water. Obliging, Hypsipyle set down Opheltes in a bed of wild celery within a sacred space and led the men away. In her absence, a snake - the protector of the space - strangled the child.Pache, Corinne Ondine. The Hero Beyond Himself: Heroic Death in Ancient Greek Poetry and Art. Trinity University, 2009. Opheltes posthumously received the name Archemorus which combines the words arch√≠ meaning \\"old\\" and mor√≥s, or \\"fate, destruction, or death\\" to form the epithet ‚Äúforerunner of death‚Äù or \\"beginning of doom\\". Additionally, funeral celebrations and athletic events - perhaps the Neman games - were arranged by the Seven in the late baby's honor and he was elevated to the status of hero. Crowns of wild celery were given to the victors at the Nemean games, supposedly in Ophletes‚Äô honor, and the celery stood as a symbol of sadness for the child.  Artifacts recovered  Not much pottery has been excavated from the heroon save several examples of whole vessels deliberately arranged and buried. However, a series of tablets engraved with what appear to be erotic curses have been found at the site. These tablets, seven in total and four with discernible curses written on them, serve as an acknowledgement of the cult activities that took place at the heroon; since Opheltes died a violent death at a very young age his shrine is desirable place for Greeks to practice magic, through the typical hero shrine wouldn't be. The tablets were found scattered across the heroon but each was made in the same fashion, by folding and nailing shut a sheet of lead with an inscription on its surface. The binding spells written on these tablets call for an individual to be \\"turn[ed] away\\" from their lover for the benefit of the person creating the curse. The person creating the tablet invokes different parts of their enemy's body and spirit to establish walls between them and their lover through as many facets as possible. Since the writing on the tablets is done in cursive and features letters which are not documented until the 4th century B.C.E. or later, it is likely that the curse tablets were left at the heroon after the site fell out of use. The differing styles of handwriting on the tablets indicates that each was deposited by a different individual.

It served as an inspiration and guideline for economic policy of the Christian Democrats, which was being formed at that time and that after the Second World War was for several legislatures the biggest party of government.  Participants  The document was elaborated at the end of a week of study held from 18 to 23 July 1943 in the monastery of Camaldoli in Casentino. About fifty people from the Italian Catholic Action and the Catholic Institute of Social Work participated. The jobs were coordinated by Adriano Bernareggi, Bishop of Bergamo and ecclesiastical assistant of the graduates of Catholic Action. The guiding principles were worked out by Sergio Paronetto, Pasquale Saraceno and Ezio Vanoni. The definitive drafting of the Code was attended by Mario Ferrari Aggradi, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Guido Gonella, Giuseppe Capograssi, Ferruccio Pergolesi, Vittore Branca, Giorgio La Pira, Aldo Moro, Giulio Andreotti and Giuseppe Medici. Finally, it was presented by Pietro Pavan. None of the signatories were present in representation of religious or political entities: each of the participants assumed personal responsibility.  Premises and context  The Code of Camaldoli was conceived on the model of the \\"Malines Code\\", the first attempt at Catholic Social Doctrine, elaborated in 1927. The Camaldolese document was to be the sequel, ideal and timely. Compiled by the International Union of Social Studies in Malines, Belgium, the document represented an attempt to codify some of the fundamental principles of economic policy in the Catholic world in the twentieth century Europe (the Malines Code was then subject to partial revision in 1933).Encyclopedia of Christian Social Thought , Dominican Study Editions, 1992 - According to Norberto Bobbio, the Malines Code was, with the encyclicals Rerum novarum (Pope Leo XIII, 1891) and Quadragesimo anno (Pope Pius XI, 1931), a fundamental text of the doctrine of Christianity. Despite the Lateran Pact of 1929, the relationship between regime and Catholicism was still under tension. On July 15, just three days before the start of the work, Giorgio La Pira had started hiding the publications of the periodical \\"San Marco\\", which was immediately abolished by the regime. The day after the start of work, 19 July, there was the bombing of the Roman neighborhood of San Lorenzo, by the United States Air Force. The bombing of Rome led to an acceleration of Camaldoli's work, making the anticipated week to anticipate the return of participants to urgent commitments on the territory.  Document content  At the end of the \\"retreat\\" week, some principles were agreed upon, then articulated in 76 enunciations later collectively considered as the Codice di Camaldoli (Code of Camaldoli). Among the statements there was the definition of the function of the state: \\"The end of the state is the promotion of the common good, that is, to which all citizens can participate in their attitudes and conditions, well that individuals and families are unable to implement, since the state does not have to substitute individuals and families ... But a general directive (of social justice) must always be the protection and uplift of the less well- equipped classes, unless it is understood, distributive and commutative justice\\". The subsequent definition of \\"common good\\" is noted in the note by Pope Pius XII's famous Christmas Radio Message 1942, which describes it as \\" the external conditions that are needed by all citizens to develop their quality and their offices, their material, intellectual, and religious lives, since, on the one hand, the strengths and energies of the family and of other organisms, which have a natural precedence, are not enough, on the other, the saving will of God has not determined in the Church a universal universal society serving the human person and the implementation of its religious ends. From the Acts of the Apostles came a warning about the possible legitimacy in some cases of civil disobedience: \\" If the state issues an unjust law, the subjects are not obligated to obey, but may be required to implement what the law provides for higher reasons. the object of the law is immoral, that is, it violates human dignity or is openly in conflict with the law of God, each is obliged to conscientiously not obey.\\" About the economic life of the state, after affirming that \\"For ordering economic life it is necessary to add to the law of justice the law of charity\\", the code lists eight moral principles to be informed of the activity of economic life: * The dignity of the human person, which demands a well ordered freedom of the individual also in the economic field; * The equality of personal rights, in spite of the profound individual differences coming from different degrees of intelligence, ability, physical strength, etc. ; * Solidarity, that is, the duty of cooperation also in the economic field to achieve the common goal of society; * The primary destination of material goods for the benefit of all men; * The possibility of appropriation in the various legitimate ways among which the work is paramount; * The free trade of goods in respect of commutative justice: * Respect for the demands of commutative justice in remuneration for work; * Respect for the need for distributive and legal justice in the intervention of the state. On the duty of solidarity, the Code prescribes that \\"As long as there are members in the society who lack the necessary, it is the fundamental duty of society to provide, both with private charity, with private charity institutions and with other means, including restriction of the property of unnecessary goods, to the extent necessary to satisfy the needy. \\" And on the point of the distribution of capital, it states that \\" a good economic system must avoid the excessive enrichment that it leads to a fair distribution, and in any case it must prevent that by controlling a few on concentrations of wealth, the overwhelming small groups on the economy\\".  Document References  The document, especially in the list of 76 statements, refers to some inspirational texts, including: * Thomas Aquinas, Politicorum I,1 * Thomas Aquinas, Ethicorum I,13 * Thomas Aquinas, I, II, XXI, 4, and III * Paul of Tarso, Letter to the Romans, XII 1 - XIII, 5 * Acts of the Apostles, IV, 20 * Leo XIII, Rerum Novarum, 28 * Pius XI, Mit Brennender Sorge, 8 * Pius XII, Christmas Radio Message 1942, 102  Effects on Italian politics  According to Paolo Emilio Taviani the \\"Code\\" would subsequently strongly inspire the Christian Democrats engaged in the two decades following the reform which, as a result of the overcoming of autarchy and protectionism, provided for the liberalization of foreign trade; and influenced on housing policy (Fanfani- house plan), on the southern issue (the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno), on the forecast of works for the depressed areas, on agrarian reform, on the establishment and management of bodies state participation. Moreover, according to Andreotti, the Code was conceived as a \\"social manifestation of Italian Catholics that served as a conceptual framework for the operational developments of the constructive action of the CC and for a stable and superficial reference to the political impact with which the Catholics would have come to confront \\". However, it was in particular the system of so-called state participations to be subject to subsequent criticisms. With the subsequent translation into the laws of that program, a state-owned state system was developed, briefly referred to as a system of state participations. Accompanied by related phenomena such as subsistence and identified by detractors as a signal of impenetrable statalism, this system was increasingly pressed to be dismantled as it is allegedly detrimental to the national economy. A very discussed feature of that system was, for example, the so- called \\"improper charges\\", constituted by the costs incurred by public companies for non-productive gain initiatives, aimed at the development of depressed areas, support for employment, public control of strategic sectors for military, political and economic security in the country. According to Mario Ferrari Aggregate some of these purposes (such as full occupation) were expressly pursued with deliberate use of the possibilities offered by the system of state participations, in fact they defined the latter as \\" the preferred instrument for public intervention in the economy\\".

Design and construction Entrance to the building After a selection process during the autumn of 1990, Channel 4 invited three architectural firms to take part in a competition to design their headquarters building on the south-eastern corner of Chadwick Street and Horseferry Road in a mixed development area of Westminster. The site consisted of an abandoned deep basement of a proposed 1970's post office building. The architectural brief also incorporated a requirement for a residential development of two blocks of flats including 100 apartments, an underground car park and a small public landscaped park. The three firms chosen were Bennetts Associates, Richard Rogers and Partners and James Stirling. The Richard Rogers Partnership was chosen from the shortlist. This was the first major building that they had designed since the Lloyd's building (1978-1986). Construction of the building began in 1990 and was completed in 1994. It was built on a design and build basis. The building consists of two four-storey office blocks that are connected to a central entrance block in an L shape. The entrance has a concave glazed wall. The building is finished in grey steel cladding, which is perforated by red-ochre steel struts.

Quota reform and attack on house A group of terrorist attacked and vandalized the historic Vice Chancellor's house of the University of Dhaka on 9 April 2018 at around 1-2:20am, and destroyed doors, windows and glasses historic furniture of the building, looted valuable belongings and historic artifacts, and burned car, households and many other materials. The attack took place while the movement for \\"Quota Reform\\" in the public service recruitment examination was happening at the University Campus. Masked attackers verbally abused and tried to attack the VC. Later, a group of students along with some teachers protested the attack and rescued the Vice Chancellor. There has been some controversy regarding the attack on 9 April as one opposition party leader alleged that the attack was carried out to divert the quota-reform movement to different direction. On 11 April 2018 when Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina announced in the parliament that all sorts of quota will be scrapped from public service, Akhtaruzzaman also expressed solidarity with the Quota Reform Movement. However, on 8 July 2018, during the second phase of Quota Reform Protests, he compared the mode of activities of quota reform protesters with that of Islamist militant outfits, which was questioned by human rights activists and international political analysts. Following the agitations of students, Akhtaruzzaman ordered a bar on the entry of general people to Dhaka University campus which was criticized heavily by the Supreme Court Bar Association of Bangladesh.

Work with TQD TQD (often stylised as t q d' or ') is a collaborative act that was formed in 2015, comprising Royal-T, DJ Q and Flava D, with the name TQD being an amalgamation of the last letter of each of their names. All three artists were already signed to the Butterz record label and thus all TQD releases have also been released on Butterz. The act play and produce the genres of music that the individuals do (such as UK garage, bassline and grime), however they have released experimental tracks that cross into many other genres.

This track was released as \\"Day and Night (Day Mix)\\", however an alternate mix of the single was also released on the B-side as \\"Day and Night (Night Mix)\\".

However, Clash magazine wrote that the album was \\"disappointingly short\\" and that \\"there‚Äôs a feeling that t q d aren‚Äôt really a case for three heads being better than one\\". The Bandcamp release of ukg contained three extra tracks that were not present on the vinyl or physical CD releases. Though they have not made any official releases since their debut album as a trio, each member continues to produce and release music individually and the act still performs shows in many countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Spain and Japan.

History  In the Middle Ages, the Jews in Germany have been expelled from the cities to the countryside and to the margins of society. Therefore, they have settled usually isolated and sporadic. There has been no considerable Jewish community life anymore. Not earlier than at the end of the 16th century there has been again signs of a Jewish reorganization. Jews have begun to re-establish Jewish communities in the villages and have started to build synagogues. In Swabia, this was happening faster, than elsewhere in Germany.Sabine Ullmann, Judentum in Schwaben (bis 1800), 2013; in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns The synagogues became more and more handsome.

The base, which is part of the collection at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, stands at in height and in width. A charioteer, armed athlete or warrior, and four horse-drawn chariot are depicted in profile relief. Named for the Greek ‚ÄúApobatai‚Äù ‚Äì literally the ‚ÄúDismounters‚Äù ‚Äì the base's relief depicts the racing event or Apobates race, which was a ceremonial part of the Panathenaic Games. In this event athletes would race against other athletes by dismounting and remounting moving chariots for prizes and renown. Sculptural style The base dates to the Hellenistic period, ca. 300 B.C.E. While the base dates to the Hellenistic era, periodization is not an exact science. In this case, although made during the Hellenistic era, the artistry of the base actually falls into the categorization of Late Classical sculpture style. It is not entirely uncommon for styles to bleed over into other periods simply because specific artistic and stylistic changes are not the sole consideration for the division of periods like Classical and Hellenistic eras. Artistic styles, including that of the Apobates Base, can fall categorically into a style entirely different from the era to which they date. This Base's Classical style is characterized by a great amount of dynamic movement, realistic and defined musculature, and greater sense of depth and dimension in sculptural figures. While a great deal of the base is damaged, the Classical style is most obvious in the dynamic pose of the athlete and figural depth of the horses. Depictions in art This event became entrenched as part of the ritual of the Panathenaic Games. Among the various athletic competitions of the Panathenaic Festival, chariot racing came to prominence - though no research to date can provide a full picture of the event. However, the event is construed to be representative of past military spectacles and was integrated into a sporting event in which athletes would dismount and remount moving chariots during a race. Contestants who won the Apobates race would commemorate their victory in the Panathenaia by constructing monuments and dedicatory statues. The Apobates base is one such dedication. The victors would place them in sanctuaries and Panhellenic sites. These victory monuments became artistic expressions in antiquity. Depictions of charioteers and chariot racing became popular thematic elements to include in votive and victory dedications, as well as grave markers and sculptural decoration. The chariot became a symbol of wealth and, as a result, contributed to conspicuous consumption in society. The chariot became a prominent feature of Greek art and an important part of festivals like the Panathenaia. It was because of the connotations which chariots and charioteers held in Greek society that it became such a popular subject for Greek art. Discovery Found on the west side of the Athenian Acropolis, the base supported an athletic or military victory dedication, similar to a votive dedication. Unfortunately only the base survives. Iconography The chariot was introduced to the Greeks through trade and interaction with the Near East ca. 1400 B.C.E. However, the chariot became adopted and integrated into Greek iconography. The same motif is found in some of the earliest sculpture from mainland Greece, namely the sandstone Grave Stele at Mycenae found in Grave Circle A which dates to the 16th Century B.C.E. In ancient Greek culture, the chariot and charioteer became a symbol of power and wealth because horses were very expensive and chariots themselves extremely impracticable for Greek terrain.

Its most basic form was defined by Antti Aarne as 'white field, black seeds', where the field is a page and the seeds are letters.Antti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20), I 35‚Äì73 (p. 35). However, this form admits of variations very diverse in length and degree of detail. For example, a version from Astrakhan translates as \\"the enclosure is white, the sheep are black\\", while one from the Don Kalmyks appears as \\"a black dog runs on white snow\\",Archer Taylor, 'The Riddle', California Folklore Quarterly, 2 (1943), 129‚Äì47 (p. 137). and literary riddlers especially have produced long variations on the theme, often overlapping with riddles on pens and other writing equipment. Significance Literary riddles have been particularly prized by scholars for the insights they give into how past writers have conceptualised the act of writing.Luke Powers, \\"Tests for True Wit: Jonathan Swift's Pen and Ink Riddles\\", South Central Review, 7.4 (Winter 1990), 40‚Äì52; . .Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), pp. 92‚Äì128.Catherine Brown, ‚ÄòScratching the Surface‚Äô, Exemplaria: Medieval, Early Modern, Theory, 26 (2014), 199‚Äì214. Anglo-Saxon examples One of the Old English riddles of the Exeter book is a variations on the writing-riddle: Exeter Book Riddle 51. Earlier and more frequent examples appear among Anglo-Latin riddles, however, as follows. Aldhelm, c. C7, ‚ÄòDe pugullarbius‚Äô (‚Äòon wax tablets‚Äô) Aldhelm (c. C6), ‚ÄòDe penna scriptoris‚Äô (‚ÄòOn the writer‚Äôs quill‚Äô) Tatwine (C8), Enigma 5, 'De membrano' ('on parchment') Romance examples The writing riddle was very popular in the Romance languages,Archer Taylor, _The Literary Riddle before 1600_ (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948). and indeed arguably the first attestation of a language written in Romance rather than Latin is the eighth- or ninth-century Veronese Riddle: Here, the oxen are the scribe's finger(s) and thumb, and the plough is the pen. Among literary riddles, riddles on the pen and other writing equipment are particularly widespread. This French version is attested in a fifteenth-century manuscript: And these versions are attested in the French creole of Mauritius: Pen riddles Pen riddles are to a greater or lesser extent allied to the traditional writing riddle. Examples of pure pen-riddles include the Old English Exeter Book Riddle 60, two by the tenth-century Hebrew-language poet Dunash ben Labrat, and others follow. Palatine Anthology (Greek) I was a reed, a useless plant; for from me is born neither fig nor apple nor grape; but a man initiated me into the ways of Helicon, having shaped fine edges and having carved out a narrow channel.

The shield was found alongside other lavish grave goods and the remains of family members of Alexander the Great, including Philip II of Macedon. The ceremonial shield dates to the late fourth century B.C.E. and was discovered in 1976. Map of Vergina, formerly known as Aigai.  Background  Aigai served as the capital of Macedon until the fifth century BCE, when the capital was moved to Pella. After this move the area was still used as a burial site for elite and royal families. The shield was discovered in the second of three tombs being excavated as part of an archaeological dig in 1976. It was accompanied by other military related artifacts and the remains of a middle-aged man and woman. Some scholars have argued that the shield is the same one that Alexander the Great took from a shrine in Troy and used in his campaigns, however opponents of this theory have pointed out that the shield is not suited for battle and does not completely fit descriptions of the campaign shield, leading to them to instead propose that it was used for religious or festive purposes. Other opine that the shield belonged to Alexander's brother, Philip III Arrhidaios, who is believed to have been buried inside Tomb II. Critics have stated that this theory is also faulty, as Phillip III was not a warrior and as such, the shield and the rest of the panoply have little reason to rest in his tomb. An example of a ceremonial shield similar in function to the Ceremonial Shield from the Tombs of Vergina.  Description  The ceremonial shield is in the basic form of a hoplon (or aspis) but with more ornate decoration and is made of wood, leather, glass, gold, and ivory. The front of the shield includes a geometric pattern of ivory surrounding the border, while a gold wreath encompasses two deteriorated ivory figures in the center. Because of the erosion of the figures, their identities are not clear, but a male figures appears to tower over a smaller, female figure. The reverse side of the shield includes an ornate golden handle in a \\"T\\" shape with floral designs at the ends. Near the middle of the handle grip, two small lions are carved into the gold. Scholars such as N. G. L. Hammond believe that the figures are likely a symbol of power or royalty and that the shield's rich design fits with the other grave goods found in the royal tomb, which were made of gold, silver, and ivory.

Two were built, one of which was progressively modified to increase its speed, but in 1930 the light fighter concept was abandoned. Development In the late 1920s both France and the UK explored the possibilities of light fighters, with lower power and light armament but with rapid climb and long endurance. They were also less costly to build. The Jockey programme, as it became known, began in France in 1926 and Morane- Saulnier responded with the 1927 MS.121. This proved to be underpowered and was superseded by the MS.221, which used the same basic airframe and armament with a 30% power increase, provided by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Ae Jupiter nine-cylinder radial engine. Two MS.221 prototypes were built. The precise date of the MS.221's first flight, flown by Fronval, is not known but it was before March 1928. Despite being lighter and more powerful, it was significantly slower at altitude than its competitors, so one MS.221 prototype was re-engined with a turbo-supercharged Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9As Jupiter which could deliver full power at . The wing struts were also revised to reduce drag. It was then re-designated as the MS.222. The MS.222 climbed faster than the MS.221 but was still slow at altitude, so a further aerodynamic clean-up in 1930 replaced the cross-axle undercarriage inherited from the MS.121 with a split-axle design, resulting in the MS.223 which first flew in April 1930. By this time the failure of the \\"Jockey\\" programme was apparent and Morane-Saulnier turned their attention back to heavier, more traditional fighters. Design The parasol wing was in two parts, each with constant chord out to semi-circular tips and mounted with 7¬∞ of sweep but no dihedral. Each part had two duralumin spars and wooden ribs and was fabric covered apart from the leading edge which was strengthened with plywood. Narrow-chord ailerons occupied the entire trailing edge; as well as the normal, differential action for lateral control they could be operated together as camber-increasing flaps for landing. The joint between the two panels was supported over the central fuselage on a cabane of two inverted V-struts, one to each spar. Two almost parallel struts braced the wing at about 55% span to the lower fuselage. The Jupiter engines used were similarly installed on all variants under a dished cowling with piston heads exposed for cooling. The fighter's fuel tank was separated from the engine by a firewall and could be dropped in an emergency. Behind, the fuselage was of mixed construction; the forward main frames were metal but the structure further aft had wooden longerons and frames, with formers and stringers shaping its fabric covered, polygonal section. The front of the single, open cockpit was under the trailing edge behind a pair of fuselage-mounted Vickers or Darne machine guns firing through the propeller disc. The tail surfaces had dural frames and were fabric covered. The tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage and swept in plan, was in-flight adjustable, with split, unbalanced elevators which were narrow and had constant chord. The fighter's fin was quadrantal in profile and carried an unbalanced rudder that reached down to the keel, moving in a gap between the elevators. The MS.221 and 222 had similar fixed landing gear to the MS.121, with its mainwheels on half-axles mounted centrally on a fixed transverse V-strut from the lower fuselage and their outer ends supported by dural-faired legs with multiple rubber ring shock absorbers from the lower longerons. The track was . Both variants had steerable tailskids to assist ground handling. In place of the cross-axle and its support, the MS.223 had simpler longitudinal V-struts, and each wheel had a vertical shock absorber leg to a reinforced forward wing strut.

This provision takes effect on January 1, 2018. * Prohibit open military service of transgender individuals \\"until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above.\\" However, until the Secretary of Defense has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy of this memorandum. This provision takes effect on March 23, 2018. * Prohibit all use of Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security resources to fund sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex. This provision takes effect on March 23, 2018. * By February 21, 2018, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to me a plan for implementing both the general policy set forth in this memorandum and the specific directives set forth in this memorandum. The implementation plan shall adhere to the determinations of the Secretary of Defense, made in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, as to what steps are appropriate and consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law. As part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military. Enactment On August 29, 2017, Secretary James Mattis announced that currently serving transgender troops would be allowed to remain in the armed services, pending further study. Mattis stated he would set up a panel of experts from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide recommendations on implementing the President's policy direction. Lawsuits On August 9, 2017, the first of four lawsuits was filed in United States District Court seeking to block the Presidential Memorandum from being implemented. Jane Doe v. Trump On August 9, 2017, five transgender United States military personnel filed a lawsuit, Jane Doe v. Trump. They sued Trump and top Pentagon officials over the proposed banning of transgender people from serving in the military. The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect, under the auspices of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment. The suit was filed on their behalf by two major LGBT-rights organizations, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who filed a petition in the United States District Court in Washington. On August 31, 2017, the plaintiffs applied for a preliminary injunction on the proposed ban, stating \\"it is unconstitutional\\" and that \\"Plaintiffs have suffered serious and irreparable harms that will continue absent this Court's intervention.\\" Also on August 31, three former secretaries of military services, Eric Fanning, Ray Mabus, and Deborah Lee James, submitted declarations in support of the plaintiffs. On October 4, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in Jane Doe v. Trump and to oppose the application for a preliminary injunction, arguing instead \\"that challenge is premature several times over\\" and that Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance, issued on September 14, 2017, protects currently-serving transgender personnel from involuntary discharge or denial of reenlistment. On October 30, 2017, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the provisions of the memorandum prohibiting open military service and enlistment of transgender people. The Pentagon's six-month delay on accession of transgender individuals into military service expires January 1, 2018.Federal Judge Blocks Trump‚Äôs Trans Troops Ban, Calling It Inexplicable and Unjustified In the ruling, Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case was \\"perhaps compelling in the abstract, [but] wither[s] away under scrutiny.\\" The ruling effectively reinstated the policies established prior to President Trump's tweets announcing the reinstatement of the ban, namely the retention and accession policies for transgender personnel effective on June 30, 2017. However, the court denied a preliminary injunction against the ban on government-funded sex reassignment surgery for service members \\"because no Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are substantially likely to be impacted by this directive.\\" On November 21, 2017, the United States Department of Justice appealed the preliminary injunction in the case of Jane Doe v. Trump.DOJ appeals ruling against Trump‚Äôs transgender military ban On January 4, 2019, the court lifted the injunction. Stone v. Trump On August 28, 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Maryland filed a federal lawsuit, Stone v. Trump, on behalf of several transgender military service members, alleging that the ban violated their equal protection rights. On November 21, 2017, Judge Marvin J. Garbis granted the Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on the entirety of the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, stating in his Order \\"[t]he lack of any justification for the abrupt policy change, combined with the discriminatory impact to a group of our military service members who have served our country capably and honorably, cannot possibly constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\\" Karnoski v. Trump Also on August 28, Lambda Legal filed a federal lawsuit, Karnoski v. Trump, in Seattle on behalf of three transgender soldiers, the Human Rights Campaign, and the Gender Justice League, alleging that the ban violated equal protection, due process and free speech protections. On December 11, 2017, Judge Marsha J. Pechman issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, stating the \\"Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the policy prohibiting transgender individuals from serving openly is substantially related to important government interests\\" and \\"the prohibition on military service by transgender individuals was announced by President Trump on Twitter, abruptly and without any evidence of considered reason or deliberation.\\" The preliminary ruling was affirmed on 13 April 2018, and the policy stayed, in Karnoski vs. Trump (Western District of Washington), when the court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/judge-blocks-trump- transgender-military- ban/index.htmlhttp://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2018/04/district-judge- holds-transgender-military-ban-subject-to-strict-scrutiny.htmlDistrict Court, West District Washington, Karnoski v Trump, 13 April 2018http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2017/12/another-district-judge- issues-preliminary-injunction-against-transgender-military-ban-.html Stockman v. Trump On September 5, 2017, Equality California (EQCA) filed a lawsuit, Stockman v. Trump in United States District Court for the Central District of California against the ban; the lawsuit includes four named and three unnamed transgender plaintiffs. In the complaint, which seeks an immediate injunction based on the Fifth Amendment, EQCA noted \\"the stated bases offered in support of Defendants' August 25 Directive are pretextual, arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by facts, evidence, or analysis\\" and that \\"transgender people have been serving openly [since 2016] without incident or any negative impact upon military readiness, lethality, unit cohesion, or the national defense generally.\\" Judge Jesus G. Bernal issued an order granting the preliminary injunction and denying the motion to dismiss on December 22, 2017, writing the defendants' \\"justifications fall far short of exceedingly persuasive\\" and characterizing the ban as causing irreparable harm since \\"[t]here is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender.\\" Legislation On September 15, 2017, a bipartisan bill () was introduced by senators John McCain (R-AZ), Jack Reed (D-RI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Susan Collins (R-ME) to prohibit involuntarily separating or denying re-enlistment of transgender troops solely on the basis of gender identity. During his testimony before the Senate, the highest- ranking uniformed officer of the United States military, General Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced his advice that any troops who have served \\"with honor and value\\" should continue to serve, and that gender identity is not a credible reason for involuntary discharge. A bipartisan bill with nearly identical text () was introduced in the House on October 12, 2017. It was sponsored by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and co- sponsored by Charles Dent (R-PA), Susan Davis (D-CA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Adam Smith (D-WA), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ). Revocation As requested by the memorandum of August 25, Secretary Mattis submitted a memorandum and report regarding military service by transgender individuals. The United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, concurred with Mattis's recommendations as applied to the Coast Guard. One of the recommendations made was \\"that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.\\" On March 23, 2018, President Trump announced the prior memorandum of August 25 was revoked. With respect to future policies, the memorandum of March 23 went on to declare the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security \\"may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\\" See also *Sexual orientation and gender identity in military service *Sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States military References 2017 in American law LGBT law in the United States LGBT rights in the United States Transgender history in the United States History of LGBT civil rights in the United States Transgender law in the United States Transgender people and the United States military Discrimination against LGBT people in the United_States ","title":"Presidential Memorandum on Military Service by Transgender Individuals (2017)"},{"id":"55139291","text":"There are at least 10 named lakes and reservoirs in Pike County, Arkansas.

He worked with the British composer Benjamin Britten on Peter Grimes (1969 Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh), Owen Wingrave (1970 BBC TV World Premier, Snape Maltings), and Die Winteriesse (1970 Britten Piano, Peter Pears Tenor).  Early life  He was born on 15 September 1934 in Southport, Lancashire, England. He studied art and design at the Southport School of Art and the Central School of Art in London where he graduated with distinction. He spent several years in theatres around the UK, at Glasgow Citizens Theatre (Scotland), Leatherhead (Surrey) Hornchurch, London (where he met his wife Ursula ‚ÄòPelo‚Äô Cumpston; both worked on Owen Wingrave), and the Mermaid, London. In 1965 he joined the BBC Design Department. His great experience in repertory rheatre gave him a unique and noticeable style.  Career in design  Driven by his passion for music and in particular opera (notably the works of Richard Wagner), he was chosen to design the BBC TV production of The Flying Dutchman, starring Norman Bailey as the Dutchman, which won Myerscough- Jones an award from the Royal Television Society (1976) for his designs. He also collaborated with Opera Director Jonathan Miller to create The Beggar‚Äôs Opera starring Roger Daltry and Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, amongst others.

Wegner, and Arabella Eliza n√©e Darby, who resided in a district of London called Tulse Hill. Violet made a career in the music halls from the age of 15 and became known as the \\"Idol of Berlin\\".  Life  In 1912, Violet married her first husband, Comte Sergio Francesco Enrico Maria Brunetta d'Usseaux (born 3 March 1885, Torino, Italy), in London. Sergio's parents were Comte Eugenio Brunetta d'Usseaux and the Russian Countess Katarina Zeiffart. Eugenio was Secretary General of the Olympic Committee that administered the 1908 London Olympics. Eugenio died in 1919 in mysterious circumstances. The fate of Serge is also unknown, although it is suggested he may have been trying to reach the circumstances of father's death following the October Revolution. Violet enjoyed some success as a music hall artiste and was seen in many productions across England and the European continent. Whilst traveling in Italy during 1918, Violet met Prince Peter of Montenegro, the youngest son of the exiled King Nicholas I of Montenegro. Violet was chaperoned by her mother, Arabella, who was cautious in permitting the wedding to proceed without the payout as she feared Violet being a commoner would count against Prince Pierre's case. Arabella advised them to delay the marriage until the new Yugoslav government awarded the monies claimed by the prince for the confiscation of his family's property in Montenegro. Violet married Pierre in Paris in April 1924, before any settlement was made. After her marriage Violet converted to Orthodox faith and became HRH Princess Ljubica of Montenegro and thus sister-in-law to Queen Elena of Italy, as well as a host of other European princes and kings via her husband's siblings. Violet and Pierre continued to live on the continent, particularly at Monte Carlo where they were regular visitors to the Casino. Once married, Violet gave up her performing career. Violet did not forget her former profession and those who 'trod the boards' however. Notably, the only wreath to be sent by any member of any royal family to the funeral of the celebrated Lillie Langtry in Jersey on 23 February 1929 was sent by the Prince and Princess Pierre of Montenegro. Prince Pierre died in 1932 at a sanatorium in Merano, Italy aged 42.

The Andokides painter created the red-figure style of pottery as we know it today during his working years from 530-515 BC. Starting around 530 BC the Andokides painter produced red-figure amphorae and a bilingual kylix. Fewer than 20 vases survive by the Andokides painter but they span 30-40 years of his career, allowing historians to trace the development of his painting styles. One of the earliest mentions of the Andokides painter was on a black-figure hydria by Timagoras around 550 BC, when the Andokides painter must have been an apprentice. A bilingual amphora by the Andokides Painter;Munich, Antikensammlungen 2301  Red-figure technique  The red- figure technique was likely perfected, if not created, by the Andokides painter. This revolutionary technique made the compositions stand out more so they were easier to see from a distance. It essentially used the same materials as the black-figure, but reversed the way the image figures were created. Instead of using incision and added light colors to define figures, figures were left with light glaze then defined with black lines while the background was filled in black. This contrast of light on dark made the composition stand out as opposed to the dark, shadowy figures on a black- figure composition. This created a need, however, for even more decorations along the top, bottom, and sides of the main register in order to delineate the black of the vase from the black background of the figural scene. Red figure side of Munich, Antikensammlungen 2301 The introduction of the red- figure technique can be related back to the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi. The style of the Andokides painter is remarkably similar to the sculptural decorations on the treasury. This similarity can be traced through the particular details in armory and human anatomy, the use of drapery lines, and also through the subject of the struggle for the Delphic tripod. According to Dietrich von Bothmer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, only the Andokides painter has been known to emphasize calf muscles with three curved lines as is also seen on the frieze of the Siphnian Treasury. This relation shows that the Andokides painter was inspired by the sculptural decorations on the treasury and incorporated aspects of that into his own works.  Bilingual eye cup  The only bilingual kylix eye cup by the Andokides painter dates to ca. 530 BC. The figures on this kylix are of warriors around the handles, archers between the eyes on the red-figure register, and a trumpeter between the eyes on the black-figure register; most of the tondo is lost but what fragments remain are just of ray patterns. The composition is simple enough, but the unique aspect of this kylix comes in the specifics dividing the painting techniques. Scholars generally attribute the black-figure compositions of the Andokides painter's vases to the Lysippides painter. On this bilingual eye cup the demarcation between red-figure and black-figure is so specific that both of the black-figure warriors who are in supplication on the ground have red- figure shields that have fallen out of their hands.  Elite soldiers  The hoplite warriors depicted in the bilingual kylix were Greek warriors who fought in closed ranks, or a phalanx. Hoplites were the most common type of soldier in the 7th through 4th centuries BC. These soldiers carried long thrusting spears (doru) in their right hands and shields in their left with a short sword (xiphos) on the hip. The shields would protect the soldier's own body and the right side of the warrior to his left. This set-up of soldiers allowed all but the ones on the ends of rows to be fully protected during battle. The phalanx formation didn't allow for much movement but the Greeks were the best warriors around regardless of any mobility issues.

The legacy traces back to 1924 when the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest Muslim body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandatory Palestine, accepted Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) as custodian of Al-Aqsa. The custodianship became a Hashemite legacy administered by consecutive Jordanian kings. Jordan controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1948, and annexed the territories in 1951 until they were lost to Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Jordan renounced claims to the territory in 1988, and signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, whose 9th article states that Israel commits to \\"respect the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem\\" and that \\"when negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines.\\" In 2013, an agreement between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority recognized Jordan's role. Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock were renovated four times by the Hashemite dynasty during the 20th century. In 2016, King Abdullah II participated in funding renovation of Christ's tomb in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and in 2017, Abdullah donated $1.4 million to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, the Jordanian authority responsible for administering Al-Aqsa. An independent report estimates the total amount that the Hashemites have spent since 1924 on administering and renovating Al Aqsa as over $1 billion.

Revered as the location where Muhammad ascended to heaven, the site, known as the \\"Noble Sanctuary\\", is also associated with Jewish prophets who are venerated in Muslim religion. The Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock were constructed on the mount by Umayyad Caliphs. In 692 AD, the dome was constructed, making it one of the oldest Islamic shrines to exist. History Mandatory Palestine verbal agreement: 1924-48 The legacy traces back a 1924 verbal agreement when the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest Muslim body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandatory Palestine, accepted Hussein bin Ali (Hashemite Sharif of Mecca) as custodian of Al-Aqsa. The Hashemites are descendants of Muhammad, who ruled over the holy city of Mecca for 700 years until they were ousted by the House of Saud in 1924. The custodianship became a Hashemite legacy administered by consecutive Jordanian kings. Sharif Hussein was buried in 1931 near the Al- Aqsa mosque where his funeral also took place. Jordanian control period: 1948-67 The sharif's son, Abdullah I (the first King of Jordan) is said to have personally extinguished a fire which engulfed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1949. Jordan under Abdullah I had occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and annexed the territories in 1951. Abdullah I was assassinated a year later as he was entering the mosque to pray. King Hussein in 1965 ordered the construction of a palace in East Jerusalem in 1965 to symbolize Jordan's sovereignty. It was abandoned after Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, and the palace remains uncompleted to this day. 1967-94 Israeli peace treaty: 1994 onwards Jordan renounced claims to the territory in 1988, and signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, whose 9th article states that Israel commits to \\"respect the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem\\" and that \\"when negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines\\". Palestinian-Jordanian agreement: 2013 onwards In 2013 an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Authority (represented by Mahmoud Abbas) and King Abdullah II recognizing Jordan's role, replacing the decades-old verbal agreement. Recent events Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel in 2014 following tensions at Al-Aqsa Mosque between Israelis and Palestinians. Abdullah met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Amman in late 2014, and the Jordanian ambassador returned when Israeli authorities eased restrictions and allowed men of all ages to pray at Al-Aqsa for the first time in months. In 2016, King Abdullah II participated in funding renovation of Christ's tomb in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and in 2017, Abdullah donated $1.4 million to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, the Jordanian authority responsible for administering Al-Aqsa. An independent report estimates the total amount that the Hashemites have spent since 1924 on administering and renovating Al Aqsa as over $1 billion. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem commenting on the King's donation to the renovation of the Church: \\"Jordan‚Äôs role in protecting Christian existence in the Holy Land is clear and undeniable, King Abdullah spearheads the efforts of all Jordanians to sow the seeds of love and brotherhood between Muslims and Christians. We are reaping the fruits of these efforts in this age when sectarian wars are burning entire countries as can plainly be seen.\\" On 24 July, following the 2017 Temple Mount crisis, Israel agreed to remove metal detectors from Al-Aqsa after Abdullah phoned Netanyahu. However, it is unclear if Jordan influenced Israel's decision. Leaders of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre issued a statement of support to Abdullah on 1 March 2018 after Israel shelved a proposed bill that aimed to propose new tax measures to churches in the West Bank. \\"Your defence of religious freedom and Your leadership, in ensuring that the Status Quo is respected and maintained, has been crucial in our ongoing attempts to guard and protect the Christian presence especially in the Holy City of Jerusalem\\", the statement read. Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem expressed his support for the Hashemite role during a 2018 joint Jordanian-Palestinian Christmas celebration: \\" For You, Your Majesty, the King of the beloved Jordan, are the Custodian of the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, including the Holy Sepulchre and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. This Custodianship that forms a shield of protection and an extension to the Omary Covenant that took place between the Patriarch Sophronius and Caliph Omar Ibn Al Khattab. We are keeping this covenant with you until God inherits the earth\\". Bernard Sabela, an Arab Christian Jerusalemite and a retired sociology professor from the Bethlehem University, told The Jordan Times in early 2019 that he compares Jordan's role \\"..to a bright moon in a dark night when there are no other stars.\\" He added: \\"We in Jerusalem feel that Jordan, and in spite of all the pressures, challenges and waves of refugees, is still constant in its support and strongly attached to Jerusalem and its holy sites. This is not merely rhetoric‚Ä¶ Jordan does not only take stands, but also translates them into actions.\\" Recognition Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab League, United States, European Union and Turkey recognize Jordan's role. In December 2017, Federica Mogherini, the European Union foreign policy chief said that \\"Jordan has a very special role, when it comes to the holy places, His Majesty, the King of Jordan Abdullah II, is the custodian of the holy places and he is a very wise man.\\" References Temple Mount House of Hashim ","title":"Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites"},{"id":"55139671","text":"Holmes' Bank was a bank in the British Crown dependency of the Isle of Man, providing private and business banking services to the local population.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, February 12, 1937; Page: 10 Holmes' Bank crashed spectacularly in 1853 resulting in hardship, unemployment, bankruptcy and destitution for many of the inhabitants of the Island. History Origins The early history of banking on the Isle of Man is rife with incompetence and mismanagement. Whilst the earliest banks in England were an integral part in trading as far back as the 12th Century, banking was unknown on the Isle of Man until the beginning of the 19th Century. The earliest Manx bank began business in 1802 at Castletown. It was known as the Isle of Man Bank and carried on trading until 1818.Isle of Man Daily Times. Tuesday, January 17, 1961; Page: 3 A feature of Manx life at that time was a profusion of bank notes in circulation issued by tradesmen for small amounts and an Act to control note issues was passed in 1817. Five bank licences were issued under this law. The Bank of Wulff and Forbes opened in 1826 and was taken over 10 years later by the Isle of Man Joint Stock Banking Company, which ended in a disaster in 1843. In 1836 the Isle of Man and Liverpool Banking Company was formed, being wound up two years later. Another bank, the Isle of Man Commercial Bank was also formed during the mid 1840s, being absorbed into the City of Glasgow Bank, which traded on the Isle of Man under the title Bank of Mona, which became the bank of the Isle of Man Government. Formation Holmes's Bank was set up by three brothers; John, Henry and James Holmes the bank's premises being situated on South Quay, Douglas. The brothers' Holmes were involved in various business ventures, ostensibly establishing themselves in the running of passenger and cargo shipping, banking being merely a subsidiary activity of what was virtually a general trading concern. Operation The brothers commenced their banking operation in 1815 the bank forming a reputation for soundness and stability, serving the people of the Isle of Man in a prudent manner up until 1845. However, in the years 1846 and 1847 the bank began involving itself in reckless trading speculations, chiefly involving Liverpool brokers paving the way to its subsequent collapse. Failure Henry Holmes died in 1848, the banking business and other concerns being carried on by his surviving brothers. Profligate practice continued resulting in the failure of Holmes' Bank in 1853, leaving liabilities of approximately ¬£300,000. Aftermath The failure of Holmes' Bank caused acute misery and suffering on the Isle of Man. An investigation of the affairs of the bank disclosed that notes far in excess of the number authorised by licence had mysteriously got into circulation.

A. Hinds is a proponent for renewable energy sources in the West Indies and adviser to the Prime Minister of Barbados. Hinds was awarded the British Government's Chevening Scholarship in 1984 where he gained a Masters of Science in Alternate Energy from the University of Reading, which covers the entire spectrum of Alternate Energy. Hinds was also a recipient of the International Visitor Leadership Programme provide by the United States Department of State in 2008. Youth and Education Hinds was born in Barbados on 3 February 1961. He received his secondary education at Harrison College in Barbados, and studied at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus where he obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Natural Sciences. On completing his postgraduate studies, he returned to Barbados and began working on Organization of American States (OAS) and Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) projects in the area of Bio-gas Digesters and Wind Energy. The Wind project included the development of Grid Stability Studies and Wind Resource Mapping on site selection. The Barbados Project was the largest wind turbine in the Caribbean in the 1980s. Career in Industry By 1990 Hinds started a company to produce solar dryers which could be used for both agriculture and industrial purposes. The first challenge of this technology was solving a problem relating to the shelf life of a cream of wheat type product that lasted no more than two months. Hinds produced a walk- in solar dryer with computerized temperature controls and back up heating, that dried the produce enough for it to have a 12-month shelf life, with the added benefit of making it an exportable product. Between 1990 and 1996 he developed a solar dryer to dry imported lumber for the local furniture industry. Hinds then joined the University of the West Indies (UWI), Cave Hill Campus as project manager of the Solar Programme in 1996, developing solar dryers, solar stills and installing most of the solar electric systems commissioned by the Barbados Government, at the time. In 2004, Hinds introduced Barbados' first solar electric vehicle, a solar powered golf cart, which came a few years after Hinds introduced Barbados‚Äô first solar powered bicycle. This was followed by solar shuttles used as the first of its kind in Barbados and the Caribbean to give tours of the capital city using solar vehicles. Hinds was invited by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to ship one of these vehicles to be used at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2009. Hinds developed, and taught Barbados‚Äô first ever PV installation courses to over 100 participants from four Caribbean countries. This benefit was then exported to Belize, where Hinds trained 27 persons in that country, and 20 staff of the Anguilla electric utility. He conceptualized and designed multimillion-dollar regional renewable energy projects, which attracted support from over 13 Caribbean countries and the Global Environmental Facility. This project evolved into the Caribbean Renewable Energy Development Project which is based at the CARICOM Secretariat, Guyana. Hinds helped develop the Caribbean's first large scale solar powered ice plant in Skeete's Bay, St Philip, Barbados; Barbados' first solar demonstration house, which is on display in Queen's Park, Bridgetown; and Trinidad's first solar demonstration house located at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. Hinds is a speaker and author. He wrote Householders Guide to Cool Solar Houses () and Garden Adventure, How a Solar Water Heater works (). Career in Government Between 1990 and 1996, Hinds worked as a development officer for the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Hinds serves as Chief Energy Conservation Officer in the Energy and Telecommunications Division in the Office of the Prime Minister. Personal Hinds has two sons.

These legislative elections, the first experience of universal suffrage in French History, were held in an extremely tense national context, less than a month only after the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 (attack and take of the Royal Palace of the Tuileries by the armed Parisians, or the ¬´Second Revolution¬ª) and under the imminent threat of the Austrian and Prussian troops led by the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, which were marching on Paris to ¬´free¬ª King Louis XVI (who had been arrested and suspended during the journ√©e of August 10), and to restore the absolute monarchy. During its first session held in the Salle du Man√®ge (the indoor riding academy hall, seat of deliberations during most of the French Revolution since 1789) the 21 September 1792 (the day following the victory of the French troops at the battle of Valmy), the National Convention proclaimed the Abolition of Royalty. The next day, on 22 September 1792, it proclaimed the French First Republic by decree. Hence from this day, all public bills will be dated from ¬´ Year I ¬ª of the Republic. Cal√®s joined the political group of the ¬´ Mountain ¬ª (French: La Montagne, whose members sat on the highest benches of the Assembly), which was considered as the most radical group of the assembly and was led by personalities such as Georges Danton, Jean-Paul Marat and Maximilien de Robespierre.

Soon after (six months later), on 5 August 1793, Cal√®s, then Representative on mission to the armies of the Ardennes (see below), will send a letter from the camp of Ivoy to the Convention to mark his adhesion to the decree which provided for the dismissal of Queen Marie-Antoinette before the Revolutionary Tribunal. He will speak in these terms:¬´ J.-M.

Only a few hours later, Marie Antoinette will be guillotined, like her husband, on Revolution's Square. Following the King's death, the National Assembly left the Salle du Man√®ge and moved on 9 May 1793 to the neighbouring Tuileries Royal Palace. It settled into the Salle des Machines (Hall of the Machines), which was larger, more comfortable and more adequate to the parliamentary sessions, and where the Assembly will carry out the main part of its works (until its final and definitive transfer into the current Palais Bourbon on 21 January 1798). = Project of Constitution = It was in the Salle des Machines of the Tuileries Royal Palace that the National Convention held the majority of its sessions from 9 May 1793 to 21 January 1798.

In the course of the same year, Cal√®s was one of the fifty deputies who were commissioned to draft a project of constitution, concurrently with the one proposed by Condorcet the 15 and 16 February 1793 (Girondin constitutional project).Nicolas de Caritat. \\"Plan de Constitution pr√©sent√© √† la Convention nationale les 15 et 16 f√©vrier 1793, l'an II de la R√©publique (Constitution girondine)\\", in Digith√®que de mat√©riaux juridiques et politiques by Jean-Pierre Maury, retrieved November 4, 2008 He published two liberal booklets entitled: ¬´ Notes on the plan of ConstitutionSee the ¬´ Notes de Jean-Marie Cal√®s, d√©put√© de la Haute-Garonne, sur le plan de constitution pr√©sent√© par le Comit√©.

Imprim√©es par ordre de la Convention Nationale ¬ª (1793) ¬ª. Although he was a deputy of the mountain, Cal√®s criticized the plan of constitution proposed by the Committee of Public Safety which consecrated the Rousseauist democratism of popular sovereignty (direct democracy) to the detriment of the principle of national sovereignty (representative democracy) inspired by Montesquieu, and then by Siey√®s in 1789.¬´ Les Gauches fran√ßaises 1762-2012, Histoire et politique ¬ª, Jacques Julliard, Champs histoire, Flammarion (2012). Thus, the Committee's project, very democratic and decentralized, envisaged that the French people would be distributed, for the exercise of its sovereignty, in Primary Assemblies of cantons. The representative Cal√®s recalled that ¬´ the people taken en masse, could not, in a large State, exercise by itself its right of legislation, nor handle the ship's wheel of the government ¬ª at the risk that ¬´ the whole of France would see its workshops, its agriculture and its trade abandoned, and the people would be continually assembled into deliberative assemblies ¬ª. Thus, he advocated the organization of a ¬´ representative republic ¬ª, which should not be ¬´ absolute ¬ª. Also, against the excesses of egalitarianism, he proposed a 'republic of merit', offering to establish four ¬´ degrees of honor ¬ª in the State: for the farmer, the warrior, the scholar and the artisan (¬´ I would have liked these degrees of honor to be personal, and that the quality of being a French citizen made it the basis and the merit ¬ª). He also opposed making the right to insurrection a law of the Republic (¬´ It is in nature, and you have no need to erect it fastidiously and unnecessarily into a law ¬ª). Finally, the liberal and tolerant Cal√®s criticized several of the directive and uniformizing proposals of the Committee aimed at reinforcing the Unity of the social corps and of the nation: > ¬´ Indeed, the self-interest, the self-esteem, the inclinations of both sexes > towards each other, the religious sentiments, that we can change, modify, > but not destroy, these motives of the human heart, have counted for nothing > in the calculations of the Committee ¬ª. The Convention solemnly promulgated the Constitution of the Year I on June 24, 1793 (constitution of the 6 messidor year I, the \\"convention montagnarde\\"). It was ratified by referendum on August 9, but was never implemented because of wartime. Indeed, two months later only, on October 10, 1793, the Convention decreed that its application was suspended indefinitely and ¬´ the government will be revolutionary until peace ¬ª.Kennedy, M. L. \\"The Jacobin Clubs in the French Revolution: 1793-1795,\\" p.53. Berghahn Books, New York: 2000. The Convention adopted a few years later the Constitution of the Year III (August 22, 1795, which included in its preamble the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the Citizen of 1795), which was approved by plebiscite on September 6, 1795, and founded the new regime of the Directory (it established also the Census suffrage, and politically, provided for a two-house legislature: a Council of Five Hundred and a Council of Ancients, and a unique kind of executive: a five-member committee (Directory) chosen by the legislature). = Project on Public Education = In the context of the revolutionary great's idea of the regeneration of man, and of woman in particular, Cal√®s also published a project on public education,See ¬´ De l'√©ducation nationale, par Jean-Marie Cal√®s, deput√© de Haute-Garonne. Imprim√© par la Convention Nationale ¬ª regarded as very progressive for the time,See ¬´ L‚Äôinstruction en France pendant la R√©volution.

Yes, always occupied with men, I never hear > about women. ¬ª These debates on the public school were at the time the opportunity for the conventionals to define the norms of the new femininity. Within this project influenced by the ideas of Condorcet, Cal√®s developed his innovative proposals for the establishment of public education houses ¬´ differing from the old convents ¬ª in which no religion would be taught, for girls aged from eight to twelve or fifteen, ¬´ entrusted to citizens [women] known for their virtues, talents and love for the laws of the state ¬ª. There, they will receive an education ¬´ based on the eternal laws of reason and truth ¬ª, they will learn to read, write, speak French, count and hold a household. Not yet free, this education would nevertheless be moderate and financed on the basis of income, including a maximum beyond which the State will bear the additional expenses. Similarly, in July 1793, in order to remedy to the illiteracy in the army, Cal√®s proposed that military rank advancement should no longer be simply determined by seniority of service criteria, but rather conditioned on reading and writing proficiency. ¬´ It is urgent to remedy this abuse by demanding that the individual should meet the required qualities ¬ª.It was especially the mode of advancement which raised, as elsewhere, the strongest complaints. According to the most general interpretation of the law of 21‚Äì25 February 1793, which reserved one third of the vacant places ¬´ for seniority of service with equal rank, ¬ª an old soldier could, in less than three weeks, advance from corporal to brigade commander. ¬´ It has been wished, wrote the representative Cal√®s, that one should advance to the same rank by seniority of service; but often the oldest is an illiterate man who will occupy a position for which he can not fulfill the functions, and soon, not one of your officers will neither read nor write. It is urgent to remedy this abuse by demanding that the individual should meet the required qualities. ¬ª in ¬´ Les Volontaires 1791-1794¬ª (The Volunteers 1791-1794), by Camille Rousset, editions Perrin et Cie, Paris (1892), Chapter XXVII \\"Sentiments de l‚ÄôArm√©e du Nord apr√®s le d√©part de Custine\\" (Sentiments of the Army of the North after the departure of Custine), page 223.

As representative of the Convention, Cal√®s actively participated to the foundation of many famous current institutions as the National Museum of Natural History (June 10, 1793), the Ecole Polytechnique (September 28, 1794), the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts (October 10, 1794), the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (October 30, 1794), the Metric system, the Music Conservatory of Paris, the Conservateur des hypoth√®ques and the Special School of Oriental Languages (March 30, 1795). The decree of March 19, 1793, also affirmed, together with the Right to work, the Right to assistance for every man who is unable to work (the public aid is a ¬´ sacred debt ¬ª, Constitution of 1793). The law of Floreal, 22 Year II (May 11, 1794) organized the public assistance in the countryside. = Representative on mission = Repr√©sentant en mission (painting attributed to 296x296pxOn June 15, 1793, Cal√®s was appointed Representative on mission, an extraordinary envoy of the National Assembly for maintaining law and order in the d√©partements and armies.

Thus, thanks to these significant incitements initiated by Cal√®s and by the French public authorities, from only 80 Swiss watchmakers arrived in Besan√ßon in 1793, their number will reach the 1500 at the end of the 1st Empire, Besan√ßon becoming at the end of the XIXth century, and still nowadays, the French capital of watchmaking. = In the Committee of General Security = Back in Paris, on Ventose, 15, year III (March 5, 1795), Cal√®s was elected member of the Committee of General Security, a committee previously designed to protect the Revolutionary Republic from its internal enemies.

He was helped for his settlement in the Belgian city by a certain police commissioner Wassin, who at first took him for his younger brother (the Colonel of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e, Jean-Chrysost√¥me Cal√®s) with whom he had served.The extract from the following letter (sent from Li√®ge on October 21, 1833 addressed by Cal√®s to one of his nephews, Godefroy Cal√®s, then also doctor in Villefranche-de-Lauragais, and future Republican representative in 1848) gives an interesting piece of information about the life he lived in Li√®ge. One can see that the former member of the Convention had not, like so many of his colleagues, repudiated his democratic principles. ¬´ To Monsieur Cal√®s, doctor of medicine, in Villefranche-de-Lauragais, through Toulouse, France. My dear friend. Your letter, full of wit and sparkling with gaiety, gives me the greatest pleasure; you remind me of the mischievousnesses of my youth, of which I do not repent; they made me laugh before, why should they make me cry now? I shall never forget that they made me bear without difficulty the misery, which continually heaped on me, that they have softened the bitterness which the exercise of medicine entails with it, a divine art in itself, yet detestable for him who exercises it. The uneducated public, the ignorant confreres, jealous and envious, give a thousand disgusts to the educated practitioner; I know that we can gain by it over all of that; but we feel some anguish, which we bear with difficulty. You tell me that a nobleman has vexed you because you were my parents: that does not astonish me from him; it is a caste so low, so ill-educated, that one can expect of it only the fruits of ignorance and prejudice. I am sure that the idiot who vexed you, if he lost his place, is as flat today as he was arrogant then. I have seen nobles of another flock, such as the Bethune-Sully, the Lagrange, the Nivernais, the Rohan, honoring themselves to be as sentinels at my door, and lavishing upon me the testimonies of the most adulatory sentiments, down to baseness. I‚Äôm citing this to prove you that these nobles have no nobility and, as long as this caste will exist, it will be the misfortune of France. I do not wish it to be annihilated, but I would have it put into the inability to harm. Here is my position in Li√®ge. After living in Munich and Basel, in Switzerland, I came to Li√®ge fifteen years ago. The police commissioner Wassin confused me with my brother Chrysost√¥me [Jean-Chrysost√¥me Cal√®s, A.N.], with whom he had served, and proposed me to remain at Li√®ge. The plan of the Bourbons was to push us until Siberia, and a safe asylum was, then, a treasure. I found it here. I first occupied myself to make theses for the candidates in medicine, which produced me twelve hundred francs a year. Soon after, a few cures, which made a certain noise, attracted to me a prodigious number of patients, but because I was not a Belgian doctor, I decided to give consultations at my house and I refused to go to see the patients, excepted only if I would be called in consultation by doctors, what happens sometimes. There are no important people who had not come to me yet, and the public has followed their example, which has given me some consideration. As I helped and pleased a lot of people, everyone tries to help me. Everything I do is free; a sober life puts me above any need and with a small income I look like a rich man. Embrace for me my sisters. The eldest [Marie-√âtiennette Pujol, born Cal√®s, A.N.] first had the courage to write to me before the end of my exile. I am grateful to her. Justine [Marie-Justine Pujol, born Cal√®s, A.N.], whom I left as a child, always had my friendship. I thank you for giving me news of her. [...] All yours. Cal√®s. A thousand greetings to your wife [L√©onie- Alphonsine-Zulm√©e Cal√®s, born Metg√©, A.N.], of which you do not speak and to your little boy [Jean-Jules-Godefroy Cal√®s, born in 1828, then 5 years-old in 1833.

The Bourbons, shortly after, answering to the solicitations of a friend to whom Cal√®s had saved the life during the Terror, consented to let him return to France, but Cal√®s refused, alleging that being exiled by a law, he could only come back by a law. Cal√®s was a scholar, and did not cease, at Liege, to occupy himself with various works of great interest for the agriculture. The Society of Emulation of this city awarded him the prize, in its session of the 21 April 1821, for his Memoir on the question proposed by this society: Which are the obstacles that have hindered in our climates the propagation of merinos? What are the means to overcome them and to breed these animals and the cross-breeds that come out from them? (See the minutes of this meeting). He provided the Journal of Agriculture of the Kingdom of the Netherlands with several articles on rural economy. Dr. Cal√®s ended his career in Li√®ge, in February 1835 [sic], at the age of more than 70 years, leaving a little fortune, fruit of 20 years of work.

After the Revolution of July 1830, he did not wish to take advantage of the abrogation of the amnesty law promulgated by the Monarchy of July, and thus he never returned to France.

Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 102.  Cheraman Perumal and Chundara Murti Nayanar  Cheraman Perumal, according to Chekkizhar, was a son of the ruling Poraiyan king who lived at Kodungallur or Tiru -Makotai. When the king retired for sanyasa, the Chera ministers consulted among themselves and requested the young prince to take up the reins of the kingdom. The prince, a passionate devotee of Shiva at the Tiruvanchikkulam Temple, was initially unwilling to accept this responsibility. He was worried of the impact such a career would have for his routine of daily worship. The Cheraman reluctantly agrees to become the king of Kerala. Time goes by and the Cheraman turns out to be a just and generous ruler. Cheraman Perumal then learns about lyricist Chundara Murti, another Shiva devotee, and plans to meet him in the neighboring Chola kingdom. At Thiruvarur, the king meets Chundra and prostrates before him. The two become close friends over time and start on a long pilgrimage across south India, through the Chola, Pandya and Chera lands. Years later, Chundara pays a visit to his friend in Makotai and stays in the city as a guest of his fellow- devotee. One day messengers from Shiva arrive in Tiruvanchikkulam inform Chundara that it was now time for him to return to Mount Kailasa. Chundara ascents to Kailasa on a white elephant sent by Shiva (with the Chera king following him on horseback).

The individual's depiction as a boxer is apparent in his broken nose, cauliflower ear, and the strapped wrist that he holds aloft - these straps were used by the Ancient Greeks to secure knuckle- guards for boxing competitions. It is considered one of the earliest examples of a highly individualized athlete depiction in Ancient Greek sculpture, and \\"nearer to a portrait than any other work surviving from Archaic Greece\\" (together with the Sabouroff head). It utilizes relief carving techniques to characterize a subject long before high degrees of individual characterization were apparent in freestanding sculpture.  Discovery  The stele fragment was discovered in 1953 by Threpsiades, in the remains of Athens' Themistoklean Walls. It hangs today in the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum.  Boxing in Ancient Greece  In ancient Greece, there were very few rules in boxing - it was a brutal sport. Gloves were not typical in the ancient Greek version of the sport; rather, fighters wore himantes, or leather thongs, around their wrists and the lower part of their hands to protect them from damage. In Plato's Gorgias, he refers to them as \\"folk with the battered ears,\\" referencing their tendency to become disfigured by violence, like the cauliflower ears depicted in the stele In fact, it was not unusual for a fighter to become seriously injured or even killed in this ancient sport.  Other Ancient Greek Depictions of Boxing  This stele fragment's subject can be compared to the notable Boxer at Rest, also known as the Terme Boxer. Unlike the boxer stele, which is in relief and of marble, this sculpture was made in the round and of bronze and copper inlay. This sculpture further depicts the detrimental physical effects of ancient Greek boxing - while the stele only has cauliflower ears, Boxer at Rest has cauliflower ears, a broken nose, and cuts and scrapes emphasized from the statue's bronze composition with inlay of copper. The extra detail and intricacy of Boxer at Rest contributes to its pathos, or emotional effect on the viewer.

Water quality  The joint research by HSBC, Green Radio, Sanggabuana, and Transformasi Hijau during June 2011 discovered that the water of Pesanggrahan river was considered 100 percent polluted, so could not be used for fish farming. The water condition was dirty with oxygen level 3.2 ppm compared to the normal level of 6 ppm. Only two river biota was found, namely snails and worms. Moreovoer, heavy metal pollutants were also detected, including lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium. Therefore, the river could not be categorized as category C source water anymore. The decrease in water quality was thought to be the results of higher density of housing on the river banks.Air Kali Pesanggrahan Tercemar 10 Persen.

By May 2016, MDK grew into a network of communities with a total monthly audience of about 20 million people. Most of the entries in the group are funny pictures, Internet memes and demotivators on issues of the day. The content is created by users and the community administration.  History  The community was founded in April 2011 by Roberto Panchvidze and Dmitry Aladyshev under the name Mudakoff (). Roberto Panchvidze is the official person at the community, he began to run online communities at age 18, while studying in Moscow in the Institute of Psychology at the RSUH. In January 2013, MDK launched a brand application for iOS. On the day of release, the application immediately became the second most popular free application in the iOS App Store after the game Shark Dash. At that time, MDK had more than 1.6 million followers. In February 2013, Nikolay Kononov interviewed anonymous MDK creators who disclosed information about the audience (about 500 thousand visitors per day) and communities‚Äô network revenues (1.5-2 million rubles per month). In July 2013, one of the founders of MDK de-anonymized and gave an interview to Hopes & Fears, from which it became known that MDK has about ten communities, with 20 to 30 employees working on them. According to Roberto Panchvidze, MDK has 12 million unique visitors a month. Pavel Durov called this publication paid journalism. On June 28, 2013 moderators of VK.com for the first time temporarily blocked MDK, which had almost 3 million subscribers. The formal reason was the substitution of content in the group advertised by MDK ‚Äî for the same reason many large communities blocked MDK. The social network acknowledged that MDK is not to blame for what had happened, but blamed the community for not monitoring advertised groups. In July 2013, the social network Odnoklassniki invited Panchvidze to create a community in their social network, similar to MDK in VK.com, but \\"nicer\\". Also MDK was responsible for the creating and running the car community Fixter and the Igroteka community. Entering Classmates meant becoming less dependent on VK.com. However, in August of the same year MDK stopped its cooperation with Odnoklassniki, accusing the latter of failing preliminary arrangements to pay for video ads display, as well as using unauthorized content in their own similar communities ‚Äî Accidents and Games@Mail.Ru. At that time, the monthly audience of MDK equaled 12 million people. In October and November 2013, MDK was at the center of scandals caused by publications about the bus explosion in Volgograd and the plane crash in Kazan. In December 2013, Rospatent approved the MDK application to register the trademark. Obtaining it would the community to more effectively fight with communities and companies using their name, and also starting from 2014 to launch branded souvenirs and clothing with the symbolics of MDK. Since October 27, 2015, MDK has been blocked on the territory of Russia by a court decision, but soon it was relaunched at a new address ‚Äî the social network VK.com transferred 7.5 million followers to the new community. By May 2016, the MDK network of VK.com entertainment groups exceeded 20 million subscribers. Among the groups with an audience of more than a million people, besides MDK itself, there were Orlyonok, IBD, Paper Airplane and Katavasia. By the end of 2016, the team of the creative agency that grew up around MDK and the communities network, according to the company itself, employed about 30 people. Launched in April 2017, the research company Medialogy analyzed the audience of the most popular communities in VK.com and concluded that MDK is leading in the number of views of one publication ‚Äî an average of 970.7 thousand views.  Scandals  Because of the risky humor and hate speech, the community has been repeatedly accused of extremism and xenophobia. In October 2013, MDK posted a meme about the bus bombing in Volgograd, which also caused a lot of resentment. Mikhail Markelov, a deputy of the United Russia party, demanded that Pavel Durov had to take responsibility for this. Pavel Durov wrote an official denial, and on 7 November the group's administrators announced that they filed a lawsuit on Markelov and demanded to collect 14,000 rubles in damages \\"caused to the organization as a result of spreading information which discredited its business reputation\\" and also demanded Markelov's official apology in the main media. On November 17, 2013, after the plane crash in Kazan, which killed 50 people, a message appeared on behalf of the community that, because there is no online broadcast of the tragedy, \\"popcorn is getting cold\\". This post aroused resentment among parliamentarians (State Duma deputy Valery Trapeznikov suggested sending \\"moral freaks\\" to public works), Kazan residents and Internet users. On June 16, 2015, the day when the singer Jeanna Friske died, the community posted a photo with a modified quote from her song: in the line \\"I have never been to Malinki\\" there was a word \\"Grave\\". A petition was issued on Change.org demanding a criminal or administrative case against the administration of the public. In response to the subsequent complaints of advertisers, on June, 19 the VK.com administration removed the photo in the community and disconnected MDK from the advertising exchange, depriving the community of the main source of income. Letters to the Prosecutor General's Office and Roskomnadzor with the demand to bring MDK to justice were sent by several State Duma deputies, including Maria Kozhevnikova, Joseph Kobzon and the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Public Associations and Religious Organizations Mikhail Markelov. Kobzon also said that he wants to call in a fight and \\"beat the hell out of\\" the MDK administrator.  Blocking in Russia  On October 27, 2015, the Smolninsky District Court of St. Petersburg decided to terminate the activities of MDK at the request of the prosecutor's office, which stated that materials on the page \\"offended the feelings of religious people, and denigrated different groups of people on the grounds of their religion and nationality\\". Community's owners challenged the court decision, but on February 16, 2016, the St. Petersburg City Court upheld it. The community was blocked for users from Russia on May 21, 2016, but shortly after the group transferred its followers to their new community with the same name.  Appraisal and influence on media  Jokes of MDK repeatedly caused discontent of the public and deputies of the State Duma. Some scandals, as in the case of Jeanna Friske, led to the creation of petitions on the Change.org service, calling on the VK.com management to close the group \\"due to the establishment of a national tension situation in Russia\\", noting that \\"the main audience of the group are schoolchildren\\". Experts from Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia, in conclusion for the prosecutor's office of St. Petersburg concluded that the information of the MDK public has the signs of \\"insulting various groups of people on the grounds of religion and nationality, public desecration of religious and liturgical literature, objects of religious veneration, signs and emblems of worldview symbolism\\". Also experts came to the conclusion that materials harm the mental health of children, adolescents, and young people. In terms of audience outreach, MDK surpasses the majority of online publications, which causes interest among advertisers. Large companies and brands like KFC, Durex, Axe Effect advertised in MDK. In August 2013, during the Moscow election campaign, the photo of politician Alexey Navalny appeared on the avatar of MDK. Since 2017 MDK creative agency promotes Burger King company in social networks. Pixels game, one of the agency's projects, was the launched in April 2017. 132,000 people started to play it in just a few days.  Owners and management  The MDK communities network belongs to the companies Hermes and Sarafanka. Sarafanka LLC, which owns the MDK trademark, belongs to Dmitry Aladyshev and Vladislav Ivashov on an equal footing. The main owner of communities, according to Fontanka.ru, was called Hermes LLC, owned by Panchvidze and Aladyshev. According to Lenta.ru, Hermes places advertising in MDK by agreement with Sarafanka.

The plants are small, reaching lengths of up to about 15 mm (0.6 in), and thallose; that is, the plant is not differentiated into root, stem, and leaf. The thallus consists of a midrib flanked by two wings that bear leaf-like lamellae on their dorsal surface. The ventral surface bears rhizoids and two rows of small scales. Petalophyllum is dioicous. The gametangia are individually subtended by extensions of the dorsal lamellae. Antheridia occur in rows or clusters near the apex of the thallus. Archegonia are clustered and surrounded by a pesudoperianth. Asexual reproduction occurs via apical tubers. Species Petalophyllum lives primarily in seasonally dry habitats on disturbed soils and sand dunes in North America, western Europe, northern Africa, India, New Zealand, and Western Australia.
