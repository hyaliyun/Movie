He fought in the Second Punic War and the First and Second Macedonian Wars. First consulship and the First Macedonian War A member of the Patrician gens Sulpicia, Sulpicius Galba was the son of Servius Sulpicius Galba. Although he had held no previous curule magistracy, the crisis of the Second Punic War saw him elected consul in 211 BC, alongside Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus Maximus. Entering his office on the Ides of March, both consuls defended the city of Rome against a surprise attack by the Carthaginian general Hannibal.Broughton, pgs. 272 & 277 Once the immediate crisis abated, and Hannibal retreated back to the south of Italy, provinces were allotted to the consuls. Although both were assigned to Apulia, the Senate, believing that Hannibal no longer posed a grave threat, decreed that one of the consuls only should remain in Apulia, and that the other should be assigned Macedonia for his province.In this context, ‚Äúprovince‚Äù meant theatre of command, as there was no province of Macedonia yet. When lots were drawn as to who was to leave Apulia, Sulpicius Galba was appointed proconsul in Macedonia, succeeding Marcus Valerius Laevinus. There he continued fighting the First Macedonian War against Philip V of Macedon.Broughton, pg. 272 In early 210 BC, at the end of his consulship, his imperium was prolonged for another year, but due to the exaggerated reports which Laevinus had made of his own achievements during his proconsulship, Sulpicius Galba was ordered to disband his army, and retained the command of only one legion and of the socii navales (or the local fleet), and he was given a sum of money to ensure his troops were well supplied and provisioned. Given the size of his forces, Sulpicius Galba could not do much in 210 BC, but he did achieve the feat of leading the first Roman fleet into the Aegean Sea and capturing Aegina, which was plundered and given to the Aetolians, who were allied with the Romans. That same year he unsuccessfully tried to relieve Echinus, which was besieged by Philip of Macedon.Broughton, pg. 280 For the following year (209 BC), his imperium was again prolonged, with Macedonia and Greece as his provinces. Besides allying themselves with the Aetolian League, the Romans also allied themselves with Attalus I of Pergamon against Philip. Galba provided 1,000 Romans to help the Aetolians in the First Battle of Lamia, while he himself was stationed at Naupactus. When Philip appeared at Dyme on his march against Elis, Galba had landed with fifteen of his ships on the northern coast of the Peloponnesus, where his soldiers were ravaging and plundering the country. However, Philip's sudden arrival forced them to return to their camp at Naupactus. When Philip was forced to return to Macedon, which was threatened with an invasion by some neighbouring tribes, Galba sailed to Aegina, where he joined the fleet of Attalus, and where both took up their winter quarters.Broughton, pg. 287 In the spring of 208 BC, Galba and Attalus united their fleets of sixty ships in a joint operation, sailed to Lemnos, while Philip pulled together all of his resources to prepare for the expected assault. Attalus attacked Peparethus, and then crossed with Galba over to Nicaea. From there they moved to Euboea, to attack the town of Oreus, which was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, but was betrayed from within and surrendered to Galba. Encouraged by this easy conquest, he also made an attempt to take Chalcis, but found it was too difficult a task. He therefore sailed to Kynos, a port town of Locris.Broughton, pg. 292 With Attalus being driven back to Asia Minor, Galba returned to Aegina, and remained in Greece for the remainder of his proconsulship, during which time he gave little further assistance to the Aetolian League in their war against Philip.Broughton, pgs. 296 & 300 In 205 BC, he was replaced as proconsul in Greece by Publius Sempronius Tuditanus.Broughton, pg. 303 Dictatorship, second consulship and the Second Macedonian War In 203 BC, Sulpicius Galba was appointed Dictator, with Marcus Servilius Pulex Geminus appointed his Master of the Horse. Galba was given the task of holding the comitia elections and to possibly prevent the consul Gnaeus Servilius Caepio from crossing over to Africa to confront Hannibal. He also spent the rest of the year investigating cities and prominent individuals who had been alienated by the war with Carthage.Broughton, pg. 311 In 200 BC, Sulpicius Galba was elected consul for a second time, this time with Gaius Aurelius Cotta as his colleague. During his consulship, he pushed to secure a renewal of the war against Philip V of Macedon. The people at Rome were very unhappy with a fresh war being undertaken before they had been able to recover from the ravages of the Second Punic War. When the prospect of war was proposed to the Roman assembly, it was rejected. However, Sulpicius reconvened the Assembly and made a speech warning the Roman people against ignoring the threat of Philip V. Fearing that Philip would come to invade Italy like Pyrrhus or Hannibal, the Assembly gave their assent and the Second Macedonian War against Philip was launched. When the consuls drew their lots for their consular commands, Galba once again obtained Macedonia as his province. Livy, 31.7-8 Galba was permitted to recruit from the army which Scipio Africanus had brought back from Africa any that were willing to serve again, but none of those veterans were to be compelled. After having selected his men and his ships, he sailed from Brundisium and landed at Apollonia, as per the plan to invade Macedonia from the west. On his arrival he met some Athenian ambassadors, who asked for his protection against the Macedonians, and he at once sent Gaius Claudius Centho with 20 ships and 1,000 men to their assistance. However, as the autumn was approaching when Galba arrived in his province, he took up his winter quarters in the vicinity of Apollonia.Broughton, pg. 323 In the spring of 199 BC, Sulpicius Galba advanced with his army through the lands of the Dassaretii, where all the towns and villages along his route surrendered to him, with only a few being taken by force. Both Philip and Galba were ignorant of each other‚Äôs movements, until Macedonian and Roman scouting parties encountered each other by accident, during which a skirmish took place. Near the passes of Eordaia the two armies set up camp some distance from each other, and several minor engagements took place, in one of which the Romans sustained considerable losses. This was followed by a cavalry engagement, in which the Romans were again beaten, but the Macedonians, who were too eager in their pursuit of the enemy, suddenly found themselves attacked on their flanks, and were forced to retreat, during which Philip nearly lost his life. Immediately after this defeat Philip sent a messenger to Galba to ask for a truce; the Roman commander deferred his decision till the next day, but during the night Philip and his army secretly left the camp, without the Romans knowing in which direction Philip had gone. After having stayed for a few days longer, Galba marched towards Pluvina, and then set up his camp on the banks of the river Osphagus, not far from the place where Philip had established his camp. Here Galba spent his time securing the territory and taking a number of towns, but did not directly engage Philip in battle. In the autumn Galba went back with his army to Apollonia. Although the campaign was considered only a minor military success, it did convince the Aetolians to ally with Rome. In 198 BC, Sulpicius Galba was replaced in Macedonia by Publius Villius Tappulus, whereupon he returned to Rome. Then in 197 BC, both he and Villius Tappulus were appointed legates under Titus Quinctius Flamininus in Macedonia.Broughton, pg. 334 In the next year (196 BC), when it was decreed at Rome that ten senatorial commissioners should be sent to help Flamininus settle political issues in Greece, as well as arrange a treaty between Rome and Macedonia, Galba and Tappulus were ordered to act as two of those commissioners.Broughton, pg. 338 In 195 BC, he may have accompanied Tappulus on his mission to report on the aggressive movements of Antiochus III the Great.Broughton, pgs. 341-342 In 193 BC, Galba was sent as an ambassador to Antiochus III along with Villius Tappulus. They first stopped to have discussions with Eumenes II of Pergamon, as they had been ordered, where the king urged the Romans to attack Antiochus at once. While staying at Pergamon, Galba fell ill. Once he had recovered, he and Tappulus travelled to Ephesus, where, instead of Antiochus, they met with Minion, whom the king had granted with full power to negotiate with the Romans. After futile negotiations, Galba returned to Rome, whereupon the Senate decided to declare war against Antiochus III, launching the Roman-Syrian War.Smith, pg. 204 Sources * Broughton, T.

This value system emphasized new ideas of femininity, the woman's role within the home and the dynamics of work and family. \\"True women\\", according to this idea, were supposed to possess four cardinal virtues: piety, purity, domesticity, and submissiveness. The idea revolved around the woman being the center of the family; she was considered \\"the light of the home\\". The women and men who most actively promoted these standards were generally white and Protestant; the most prominent of them lived in New England and the Northeastern United States.Lindley, Susan Hill (1996). \\"The Ideal American Woman\\". In You have stepped out of your place: a history of women and religion in America. Louisville, Kentucky.: Westminster John Knox Press, p. 56. . Although all women were supposed to emulate this ideal of femininity, black, working class, and immigrant women were often excluded from the definition of \\"true women\\" because of social prejudice.Patton, Venetria K.

Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Pine Forge Press, an Imprint of Sage Publications, p. 294. . Since the idea was first advanced by Barbara Welter in 1966, many historians have argued that the subject is far more complex and nuanced than terms such as \\"Cult of Domesticity\\" or \\"True Womanhood\\" suggest, and that the roles played by and expected of women within the middle-class, 19th-Century context were quite varied and often contradictory; for example, it has been argued that much of what has been considered as anti-feminist in the past, in fact, helped lead to feminism.Rupp, Leila J. (2002). \\"Woman's History in the New Millennium: A Retrospective Analysis of Barbara Welter's \\"The Cult of True Womanhood.\\" Journal of Women's History 14.1. Virtues Godey's Lady's Book was a highly influential women's magazine which reinforced many of the values of the Cult of Domesticity.Endres, Kathleen L.; Lueck; Therese L. (1995). Women's Periodicals in the United States: Consumer Magazines. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, p. xii. . Part of the separate spheres ideology, the \\"Cult of Domesticity\\" identified the home as women's \\"proper sphere\\". Women were supposed to inhabit the private sphere, running the household and production of food (including servants), rearing the children, and taking care of the husband. According to Barbara Welter (1966), \\"True Women\\" were to hold and practice the four cardinal virtues: #Piety ‚Äì Religion was valued because‚Äîunlike intellectual pursuits‚Äîit did not take a woman away from her \\"proper sphere,\\" the home, and because it controlled women's longings. #Purity ‚Äì Virginity, a woman's greatest treasure, must not be lost until her marriage night, and a married woman had to remain committed only to her husband. #Submission ‚Äì True women were required to be as submissive and obedient \\"as little children\\" because men were regarded as women's superiors \\"by God's appointment\\". #Domesticity ‚Äì A woman's proper place was in the home and her role as a wife was to create a refuge for her husband and children. Cooking, needlework, making beds, and tending flowers were considered naturally feminine activities, whereas reading anything other than religious biographies was discouraged. According to Welter, an ideal True Woman was \\"frail\\", too mentally and physically weak to leave her home. The care of her home supposedly made her feminine, and she depended on men to protect her within the shelter of it. Wilma Mankiller agrees, claiming that a \\"True Woman\\" was expected to be delicate, soft, and weak. She should not engage in strenuous physical activity that would damage her ‚Äúmuch more delicate nervous system.\\" Frances B. Cogan, however, described an overlapping but competing ideology that she called the ideal of \\"Real Womanhood,\\" in which women were encouraged to be physically fit and active, involved in their communities, well educated, and artistically accomplished, although usually within the broader idea that women were best suited to the domestic sphere. The conflation of \\"Domesticity\\" and \\"True Womanhood\\" can be misleading in that dedication to the domestic sphere did not necessarily imply purity, submission, or weakness.Cogan, Frances B., All-American Girl: The Ideal of Real Womanhood in Mid-Nineteenth- Century America, University of Georgia Press 2010. The characteristics of \\"True Womanhood\\" were described in sermons, books, and religious texts as well as women's magazines.Brannon, Linda (2005). Gender: Psychological Perspectives. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, pp. 154‚Äì155. . Prescriptive literature advised women on how to transform their homes into domestic sanctuaries for their husbands and children. Fashion was also stressed because a woman had to stay up to date in order to please her husband. Instructions for seamstresses were often included in magazines. Magazines which promoted the values of the \\"Cult of Domesticity\\" fared better financially than those competing magazines which offered a more progressive view in terms of women's roles. In the United States, Peterson's Magazine and Godey's Lady's Book were the most widely circulated women's magazines and were popular among both women and men.Matthews, Glenna (1987). \\"Just a Housewife\\": The Rise and Fall of Domesticity in America. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 6, 42. . With a circulation of 150,000 by 1860,Fackler, Mark; Lippy, Charles H. (1995). Popular Religious Magazines of the United States. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, p. 241. . Godey's reflected and supported some of the ideals of the \\"Cult of True Womanhood.\\" The magazine's paintings and pictures illustrated the four virtues, often showing women with children or behind husbands. It also equated womanhood with motherhood and being a wife, declaring that the \\"perfection of womanhood (...) is the wife and mother\\".Green, Harvey; Perry, Mary-Ellen (1983). The Light of the Home: An Intimate View of the Lives of Women in Victorian America. New York: Pantheon Books, p. 180. .Wayne, Tiffany K. (2007). Women's roles in nineteenth-century America. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, p. 1, . The magazine presented motherhood as a woman's natural and most satisfying role and encouraged women to find their fulfillment and their contributions to society mainly within the home.Mitchell, Sarah (2009). \\"A Wonderful Duty: A Study of Motherhood on Godey's Magazine\\". In: Sachsman, David B.; Rushing, S. Kittrell; Morris, Roy (eds). Seeking a Voice: Images of Race and Gender in the 19th Century Press. West Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, pp. 171‚Äì178. . At the same time, the long-time editor of Godey's, Sarah Josepha Hale, encouraged women to improve themselves intellectually, to write, and to take action that would improve the moral character of their communities and their nation. Hale promoted Vassar College, advocated for female physicians, and published many of the most important female writers of the nineteenth century. Frances B. Cogan argued that Godey's supported \\"Real Womanhood\\" more than \\"True Womanhood.\\" Reflecting the ideals of both \\"True Womanhood\\" and \\"Real Womanhood,\\" Godey's considered mothers as crucial in preserving the memory of the American Revolution and in securing its legacy by raising the next generation of citizens. Influence  The Cult of Domesticity affected married women's labor market participation in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th Century.Bose, Christine E. (1987). \\"Dual Spheres\\". In Hess, Beth B.; Ferree, Myra Marx. Analyzing Gender: A Handbook of Social Science Research. Newbury Park, Calif.: Sage Publications, pp. 278‚Äì279. . \\"True Women\\" were supposed to devote themselves to unpaid domestic labor and refrain from paid, market-oriented work. Consequently, in 1890, 4.5% of all married women were \\"gainfully employed,\\" compared with 40.5% of single women. Women's complete financial dependence upon their husbands proved disastrous, however, when wives lost their husbands through death or desertion and were forced to fend for themselves and their children. This division between the domestic and public spheres had effects on women's power and status. In the society as a whole, particularly in political and economic arenas, women's power declined. Within the home, however, they gained symbolic power.Rotman, Deborah L. Historical Archaeology of Gendered Lives. New York; London: Springer, 2009, p. 19. . The legal implications of this ideology included the passage of protective labor laws, which also limited women's employment opportunities outside the home. These laws, as well as subsequent Supreme Court rulings such as Muller v. Oregon, were based on the assumption that women's primary role was that of mother and wife, and that women's non-domestic work should not interfere with their primary function. As a result, women's working hours were limited and night work for women was prohibited, essentially costing many female workers their jobs and excluding them from many occupations. The Cult of Domesticity ‚Äúprivatized‚Äù women‚Äôs options for work, for education, for voicing opinions, or for supporting reform. Arguments of significant biological differences between the sexes (and often of female inferiority) led to pronouncements that women were incapable of effectively participating in the realms of politics, commerce, or public service. Women were seen as better suited to parenting. Also, because of the expected behaviors, women were assumed to make better teachers of younger children. Catharine Beecher, who proselytised about the importance of education and parenting, once said, \\"Woman's great mission is to train immature, weak, and ignorant creatures [children] to obey the laws of God...first in the family, then in the school, then in the neighborhood, then in the nation, then in the world....\\" Beecher, Catharine, Woman's Suffrage and Woman's Profession, Hartford 1871. One of the first public jobs for women was teaching. One estimate says that, with the growth of public education in the northern tier of states, one-quarter of all native-born Massachusetts women in the years between 1825 and 1860 were schoolteachers at some point in their lives.Bernard, Richard and Maris Vinovskis, \\"The Female Schoolteacher in Ante-Bellum Massachusetts,\\" Journal of Social History v. 10 #3, March 1977. Connection to the women's movement A New Court of Queen's Bench, an 1849 caricature by George Cruikshank, mocking the idea of women taking over the all-male world of the high courts of law. Women's rights advocates of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, and Harriet Martineau, were widely accused of disrupting the natural order of things and condemned as unfeminine. \\"They are only semi-women, mental hermaphrodites,\\" wrote Henry F. Harrington in the Ladies' Companion. However, after the Jacksonian Era (1812 to 1850) saw the expansion of voting rights to virtually all white males in the United States, many women believed it was their opportunity for increased civil liberties. Early feminist opposition to many of the values promoted by the Cult of Domesticity (especially concerning women's suffrage, political activism, and legal independence) culminated in the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Susan M. Cruea postulated that although the ‚ÄúCult of True Womanhood‚Äù set many societal restrictions that took away women's working rights and freedom, it nonetheless laid the groundwork for the later development of feminism by crediting women with a moral authority which implicitly empowered them to extend their moral influence outside the home. The ideal woman was expected to act as a status symbol for men and reflect her husband's wealth and success, and was to create babies and care for them so that her husband‚Äôs legacy of success would continue, but she was also seen as the ‚ÄúAngel in the House‚Äù whose purpose was to guide her family morally. Because of the perceived importance of the role, this ideology was imprinted on girls at a very young age; these girls were taught to value their virginity as the ‚Äú‚Äòpearl of great price‚Äô which was her greatest asset‚Äù and to develop the skills to manage a household and rear children, but they were also taught to see themselves as ‚Äúa pillar of strength and virtue‚Äù who was key not only in providing her husband a proper image but in raising boys who would later have a direct impact on the success of the nation. During the Progressive Era,Lindenmeyer, Kriste (2000). Ordinary Women, Extraordinary Lives: Women in American History.

Twain, Alcott, and the Birth of the Adolescent Reform Novel. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, p. 92. . With demands expressed in the Declaration of Sentiments, written at the Seneca Falls convention in 1848, women finally gained ratification of a constitutional amendment and the right to vote in 1920. After emancipation, these New Women could be identified by as ‚Äúcigarette-smoking, lipsticked and rouged, jazz-dancing, birth-control-using types known as ‚Äòmodern girls‚Äô or flappers.‚Äù World War II brought about a restructuring of the labor market as women stepped into the war effort on the home front. In the era after World War II, many of the ideas of the \\"Cult of Domesticity\\" were stressed again as American society sought to integrate veterans and emphasize the revival of family life. Once the troops returned home, men were encouraged to embrace family life and enter companionship marriages. Veterans returned home to be the head of the family and women who had been involved in high-paying and high-skilled wartime jobs were pushed back into the home. The remaking of the private life was central to this era. Anticommunism structured much of the American life, emphasizing the free enterprise system which brought about a period of economic prosperity and a consumer culture. In the 1950s television shows often presented series that depicted fictional families in which the mother's primary work was to raise the children and run the household. Men's and women's spheres were increasingly separated as many families lived in suburban settings, from which men commuted to other cities for work. However, this image of separate spheres disguised the reality that all groups of women continued to work for pay; many did not stop working after the men returned home from the war, they were instead forced into lower-paying jobs. Wages were low and there was little room for advancement. Women that did enter into professional fields were under intense scrutiny for going against the feminine domestic ideal. Despite neo- domestic ideals, many middle-class mothers were burdened by women‚Äôs double shift of working in the home and also a job. At the same time, women had independent lives during the day and were often active in volunteer and community activities, particularly around issues of education, health, children, and welfare. The \\"Cult of Domesticity\\" paved the way for the nuclear family. Betty Friedan‚Äôs The Feminine Mystique summed up the expectations of female nature of this time, with a focus on ‚Äúconsumerism, sexualized marriage, and civic activism.‚Äù Opposition to those ideas influenced the second wave of feminism.Ford, Lynne E.

Wotan stands in the background; illustration by Arthur Rackham to Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability to physically transform through an inherently superhuman ability, divine intervention, demonic manipulation, sorcery, spells or having inherited the ability. The idea of shapeshifting is in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest existant literature and epic poems such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Iliad. The concept remains a common trope in modern fantasy, children's literature and popular culture. Folklore and mythology 1722 German woodcut of a werewolf transforming Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), the huli jing of East Asia (including the Japanese kitsune and Korean kumiho), and the gods, goddesses, and demons of numerous mythologies, such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. Therianthropy is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants. Other terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo skin-walker, mimic, and therianthrope. The prefix \\"were-,\\" coming from the Old English word for \\"man\\" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well. While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well. =Greco-Roman= Vertumnus, in the form of an old woman, wooing Pomona, by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. Examples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Circe's transforming of Odysseus' men to pigs in Homer's The Odyssey, and Apuleius's Lucius becoming a donkey in The Golden Ass. Proteus was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason. The Titan Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father's head, fully grown, and in battle armor. The Children of Lir, transformed into swans in Irish tales In Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them. * Zeus transformed King Lycaon and his children into wolves (hence lycanthropy) as a punishment for either killing Zeus' children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon's own murdered son Nyctimus, depending on the exact version of the myth. * Ares assigned Alectryon to keep watch for the other gods during his affair with Aphrodite, but Alectryon fell asleep, leading to their discovery and humiliation that morning. Ares turned Alectryon into a rooster, which always crows to signal the morning. * Demeter transformed Ascalabus into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter Persephone. She also turned King Lyncus into a lynx for trying to murder her prophet Triptolemus. * Athena transformed Arachne into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods. She also turned Nyctimene into an owl, though in this case it was an act of mercy, as the girl wished to hide from the daylight out of shame from being raped by her father. * Artemis transformed Actaeon into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his own hunting dogs. * Galanthis was transformed into a weasel or cat after interfering in Hera's plans to hinder the birth of Heracles. * Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions after making love in a temple dedicated to Zeus or Cybele. * Io was a priestess of Hera in Argos, a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to escape detection. * Hera punished young Tiresias by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man. * King Tereus, his wife Procne and her sister Philomela were all turned into birds (a hoopoe, a swallow and a nightingale respectively), after Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue, and in revenge she and Procne served him the flesh of his murdered son Itys. While the Greek gods could use transformation punitively ‚Äì such as Medusa, turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with Poseidon in Athena's temple ‚Äì even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:Richard M. Dorson, \\"Foreword\\", p xxiv, Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 * Dana√´ as a shower of gold * Europa as a bull * Leda as a swan * Ganymede, as an eagle * Alcmene as her husband Amphitryon * Hera as a cuckoo * Leto as a quail * Semele as a mortal shepherd * Io, as a cloud * Nemesis (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape Zeus' advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which Helen of Troy was found. Vertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona's orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him. Gianlorenzo Bernini, Apollo pursuing an unwilling Daphne who transforms into a laurel tree In other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Cornix into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed. In one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death. As a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees. In some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower. \\"Cadmus Sowing the Dragon's Teeth\\" by Maxfield Parrish Sometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon's teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman. =British and Irish= Fairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called \\"glamour,\\" to create illusions.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Glamour\\", p. 191. But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others. Witches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.Eddie Lenihan and Carolyn Eve Green, Meeting The Other Crowd: The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland, p. 80 Many British fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer and The Black Bull of Norroway, feature shapeshifting. Celtic mythology Pwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn's own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll's, so that they could trade places for a year and a day. Llwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom. Math fab Mathonwy and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl. Gilfaethwy committed rape with help from his brother Gwydion. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys. Gwion, having accidentally taken some of the wisdom potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled from her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin. Tales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist's foundation myths include a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting selkie.Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans: indigenous education in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world Margaret Szasz 2007 University of Oklahoma Press Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies. Kelpie by Herbert James Draper: transformed into a human Scottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each- uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Shape-shifting\\", p360. Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales. Perhaps the best-known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise, in the Tochmarc √âta√≠ne, Fuamnach jealously turns √âta√≠n into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Parthol√≥n's settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of √âta√≠n) reborn as a human. The P√∫ca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms. Sadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill, was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich when she spurned his amorous interests. =Norse= In the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th-century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin's steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir. ; Stephan Grundy, \\"Shapeshifting and Berserkergang,\\" in Translation, Transformation, and Transubstantiation, ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz (Evanston: IL: Northwestern University Press, 1998), pp. 104‚Äì22. Svipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdagr, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went. In the Hyndlulj√≥√∞, Freyja transformed her prot√©g√© √ìttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion. The Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir's mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfj√∂tli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves. The dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan. Fafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon‚Äîa symbol of greed‚Äîwhile guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, √ìtr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki. In Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge half- human and half-wolf monsters. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras. The Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Huldra. Gunnhild, Mother of Kings (Gunnhild konungam√≥√∞ir) (c. 910 - c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel Mother of Kings by Poul Anderson,Tor Books, 2003 which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities. =Other lore= Armenian In Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the Nhang, a serpentine river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial Shahapet, a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.\\"Armenian Mythology\\" by Mardiros H. Ananikiam, in Bullfinch's Mythology Indian Ancient Indian mythology tells of NƒÅga, snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting Rakshasa (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The Ramayana also includes the Vanara, a group of apelike humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.Vanamali, Mataji Devi (2010). Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of the Monkey God Inner Traditions, USA. . pp. 13.Goldman, Robert P. (Introduction, translation and annotation) (1996). Ramayana of Valmiki: An Epic of Ancient India, Volume V: Sundarakanda. Princeton University Press, New Jersey. 0691066620. pp. 45‚Äì47. In the Indian fable The Dog Bride from Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes. Philippines Philippine mythology includes the Aswang, a vampiric monster capable of transforming into a bat, a large black dog, a black cat, a black boar or some other form in order to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as the Kapre, the Tikbalang and the Engkanto, which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called \\"anting-anting\\" or \\"birtud\\" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, Chonguita the Monkey Wife,Fansler, Dean s.; Filipino Popular Tales; a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man. Tatar Tatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children. \\"Madame White Snake\\" Picture on long veranda in the Summer Palace, Beijing, China Chinese Chinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. Madame White Snake is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced. Japanese Kuzunoha the fox woman, casting a fox shadow In Japanese folklore ≈çbake are a type of y≈çkai with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina and the tanuki. Korean Korean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho.Heinz Insu Fenkl, \\"A Fox Woman Tale of Korea \\" The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human). Somali In Somali mythology Qori ismaris (\\"One who rubs himself with a stick\\") was a man who could transform himself into a \\"Hyena-man\\" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn. Southern Africa «ÄKaggen is Mantis, a demi-urge and folk hero of the «ÄXam people of southern Africa.Dorothea F. Bleek, He is a trickster god who can shape shift, usually taking the form of a praying mantis but also a bull eland, a louse, a snake, and a caterpillar.Bleek (1875) A brief account of Bushman folklore and other texts Trinidad and Tobago The Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago's folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic. Mapuche (Argentina and Chile) The name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): \\"Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)\\", from nahuel, \\"puma (or jaguar)\\", and huap√≠, \\"island\\". There is, however, more to the word \\"Nahuel\\" - it can also signify \\"a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma\\" (or jaguar). =Folktales= * In the Finnish tale The Magic Bird, three young sorceresses attempt to murder a man who keeps reviving. His revenge is to turn them into three black mares and have them harnessed to heavy loads until he is satisfied. * In The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh, a Northumbrian legend from about the thirteenth century, Princess Margaret of Bamburgh is transformed into a dragon by her stepmother; her motive sprung, like Snow White's stepmother's, from the comparison of their beauty.Joseph Jacobs, English Fairy Tales, \\"The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh\\" * In Child ballad 35, \\"Allison Gross\\", the title witch turns a man into a wyrm for refusing to be her lover. This is a motif found in many legends and folktales. * In the German tale The Frog's Bridegroom , recorded by folklorist and ethnographer Gustav Jungbauer, the third of three sons of a farmer, Hansl, is forced to marry a frog, which eventually turns out to be a beautiful woman transformed by a spell. * In some variants of the fairy tales, both The Frog Prince or more commonly The Frog Princess and Beast, of Beauty and the Beast, are transformed as a form of punishment for some transgression. Both are restored to their true forms after earning a human's love despite their appearance. * In the most famous Lithuanian folk tale Eglƒó the Queen of Serpents, Eglƒó irreversibly transforms her children and herself into trees as a punishment for betrayal while her husband is able to reversibly morph into a serpent at will. * In East of the Sun and West of the Moon, the hero is transformed into a bear by his wicked stepmother, who wishes to force him to marry her daughter.Maria Tatar, p. 193, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, * In The Marmot Queen by Italo Calvino, a Spanish queen is turned into a rodent by Morgan le Fay. * In The Mare of the Necromancer, a Turin Italian tale by Guido Gozzano, the Princess of Corelandia is turned into a horse by the baron necromancer for refusing to marry him. Only the love and intelligence of Candido save the princess from the spell. * The Deer in The Wood, a Neapolitan tale written by Giambattista Basile, describes the transformation of Princess Desiderata into a doe by a jealous fairy. * From a Croatian book of tales, Sixty Folk-Tales from Exclusively Slavonic Sources by A. H. Wratislaw, the fable entitled \\"The she-wolf\\" tells of a huge she-wolf with a habit of turning into a woman from time to time by taking off her skin. One day a man witnesses the transformation, steals her pelt and marries her. * The Merchant's Sons is a Finnish story of two brothers, one of whom tries to win the hand of the tsar's wicked daughter. The girl does not like her suitor and endeavors to have him killed, but he turns her into a beautiful mare which he and his brother ride. In the end he turns her back into a girl and marries her. * In Dapplegrim if the youth found the transformed princess twice, and hid from her twice, they would marry. * In literary fairy tale The Beggar Princess, in order to save her beloved prince, Princess Yvonne fulfills the tasks of cruel king Ironheart and is changed into an old woman.Brady, Loretta Ellen. The Green Forest Fairy Book. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1920. pp. 132-169. Themes Shapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast's transformation in Beauty and the Beast indicates Belle's ability to accept him despite his appearance. When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is bound to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible. Examples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear's shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon) is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear's shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in The She-Bear) escapes with her new shape.Marina Warner, From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers, p. 353 In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard's mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis. Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino's \\"The Canary Prince\\" is a Rapunzel variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower. =Punitive changes= In many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths. John Bauer =Transformation chase= In many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, The Twa Magicians or Farmer Weathersky, a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing. The Grimm Brothers fairy tale Foundling-Bird contains this as the bulk of the plot.Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folk Tale, p. 57, In the Italian Campania Fables collection of Pentamerone by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect. In other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale \\"The Master Maid\\", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles.Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 57, This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p. 56, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 In fairy tales of the Aarne‚ÄìThompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in The Grateful Prince, King Kojata, Foundling-Bird, Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter, or The Two Kings' Children) or an obstacle chase (as in The Battle of the Birds, The White Dove, or The Master Maid).Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p. 89, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 In a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus's shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Transformation\\", p 960 The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe,Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, pp. 336‚Äì7, Dover Publications, New York 1965 and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her Riddle-Master trilogy: a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it. =Powers= One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about. In many fairy tales, the hero's talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless, the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, pp. 55‚Äì6, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 In an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity. =Bildungsroman= Beauty and the Beast, by Anne Anderson Beauty and the Beast has been interpreted as a young woman's coming- of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry. =Needed items= Valkyries as swan maidens, having shed their swan skins. Some shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In Bisclavret by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese tennin. Swedish writer Selma Lagerl√∂f, in The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, included a version of the story with the typical elements (fisherman sees mermaids dancing on an island and steals the sealskin of one of them, preventing her from becoming a seal again so that he could marry her) and linked it to the founding of the city of Stockholm Online text of Ch. VII in The Wonderful Adventures of Nils =Inner conflict= The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the \\"liberation\\" theme, as in Dr Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde. =Usurpation= Sister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka by Viktor Vasnetsov, Russian variant of Brother and Sister: Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat. Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret's wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in The Wonderful Birch, changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen's place. In the Korean Transformation of the Kumiho, a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In Brother and Sister, when two children flee from their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. The Six Swans are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology. =Ill-advised wishes= Many fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them.Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 60 At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. Hans My Hedgehog was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his Pentamerone the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his Italian Folktales, a girl born as an apple. Sometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In Prince Lindworm, the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In Tatterhood, a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one. Less commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. The Seven Ravens are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them.Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 136 In Puddocky, when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise. =Monstrous bride/bridegroom= Such wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! pp. 140‚Äì141 The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In Tatterhood, Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn't ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, Kemp Owyne, where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times. Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. Hans My Hedgehog, The Donkey and The Pig King fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in Prince Lindworm, the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.Terri Windling, \\"Married to Magic: Animal Brides and Bridegrooms in Folklore and Fantasy \\" In some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals' skins. In The Brown Bear of Norway, The Golden Crab, The Enchanted Snake and some variants of The Frog Princess, burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other. =Death= Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form. In The Famous Flower of Serving-Men, the heroine's murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In The White and the Black Bride and The Three Little Men in the Wood, the murdered ‚Äì drowned ‚Äì true bride reappears as a white duck. In The Rose Tree and The Juniper Tree, the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form. In some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in Beauty and Pock Face, A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers, and The Boys with the Golden Stars. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain. Similarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In The Wounded Lion, the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in The Golden Bird, the foals in The Seven Foals, and the cats in Lord Peter and The White Cat tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape.Maria Tatar, The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales, pp. 174‚Äì5, In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla's father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father. Modern =Fiction= * In George MacDonald's The Princess and Curdie (1883) Curdie is informed that many human beings, by their acts, are slowly turning into beasts.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Leinster are: Marquess of Kildare (1761), Earl of Kildare (1316), Earl of Offaly (1761), Viscount Leinster, of Taplow in the County of Buckingham (1747), Baron Offaly (1620) and Baron Kildare, of Kildare in the County of Kildare (1870). The viscounty of Leinster is in the Peerage of Great Britain, the barony of Kildare in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and all other titles in the Peerage of Ireland. The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Duke of Leinster is Marquess of Kildare. General The 3rd Duke of Schomberg, K.G. (1641-1719), was created The 1st Duke of Leinster in 1691. However, that creation became extinct upon Schomberg's death in July 1719. The family seat of the current Duke of Leinster is now Oakley Park, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Earls of Kildare from 1316 This branch of the Cambro Norman FitzGerald/FitzMaurice dynasty, which came to Ireland in 1169, were initially created Earls of Kildare. The earldom was created in 1316 for John FitzGerald. Two senior FitzGeralds, Garret M√≥r FitzGerald and his son, Garret √ìg FitzGerald served as Lords Deputy of Ireland, the representative of the Lord of Ireland (the King of England) in Ireland. The tenth earl, Thomas FitzGerald, known as Silken Thomas, was attainted and his honours were forfeit in 1537. In 1554, Thomas's half-brother and only male heir, Gerald FitzGerald, was created Earl of Kildare in the Peerage of Ireland. He was subsequently restored to the original letters patent in 1569, as 11th earl. The second (1554-created) earldom became extinct in 1599, although the original earldom survived. Dukes of Leinster from 1766 The 1st Duke of Leinster. The 2nd Duke of Leinster The family was originally based in Maynooth Castle in Maynooth in County Kildare. In later centuries the family owned estates in Waterford with their country residence being a Georgian house called Carton House which had replaced the castle in County Kildare. In Dublin, the Earl built a large townhouse residence on the southside of Dublin called Kildare House. When the Earl was awarded a dukedom and became Duke of Leinster, the house was renamed Leinster House. One of its occupants was Lord Edward FitzGerald, who became an icon for Irish nationalism through his involvement with the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which ultimately cost him his life. Leinster House was sold by the Leinsters in 1815. After nearly a century as the headquarters of the Royal Dublin Society, which held its famed Spring Show and Horse Show in its grounds, Oireachtas √âireann, the two chamber parliament of the new Irish Free State, rented Leinster House in 1922 to be its temporary parliament house. In 1924 it bought the building for parliamentary use. It has remained the parliament house of the Irish state. The Dukes of Leinster had by the early 20th century lost all their property and wealth. Their Carton House seat was sold (though one of Ireland's most historic buildings with perfectly preserved 18th century grounds, it was controversially turned into a hotel and golf course in the late 1990s by the current owner in an act condemned by environmentalists), as later on was their other residence in Waterford. The family now live in a smaller property in Ramsden, Oxfordshire. =Title dispute= A controversial claim by claimants who say they are descended from the 5th Duke, which is reported to have been largely debunked by Michael Estorick in 1981, was made in 2006 and subsequently failed.Peterkin, Tom. Battle over Irish dukedom settled, Daily Telegraph, 21 April 2007. Accessed 12 June 2008. In 2006, a lawsuit was filed with HMG's Department of Constitutional Affairs by Theresa Pamella Caudill, daughter of Eleanor and Maurice F. ‚ÄúDesmond‚Äù FitzGerald, on behalf of her nephew, a California builder, Paul FitzGerald, as claimant to be the rightful Duke of Leinster. FitzGerald was claimed to be the grandson of Major Lord Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1916), the second son of Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Duke of Leinster, who was recorded as having been killed in action during the First World War, while serving with the Irish Guards. When Maurice FitzGerald, 6th Duke of Leinster died, mad and childless, in February 1922, the Leinster dukedom and its considerable wealth and estates devolved upon his youngest brother, Lord Edward FitzGerald, who succeeded as 7th Duke. However, Paul FitzGerald‚Äôs supporters claim that Lord Desmond faked his death and emigrated to California, by way of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he lived until his death in 1967. It was further claimed by Mrs Caudill that a package of documents, witnessed by the Prince of Wales, Sir Edgar Vincent, and Lord Feversham, had been lodged by her father with the Crown Office of the House of Lords in 1929, and the family had been denied access to them. Mrs Caudill believed the documents included evidence that her father agreed to relinquish the title for one generation but made it clear it was to be passed down to his son, her brother Leonard FitzGerald. Instead, it was passed down through her father's brother's family. It was alleged that an archivist had acknowledged the package had once existed, but the official line was that it was now lost. The Baron Falconer of Thoroton, Lord Chancellor (2003‚Äì2007), and Harriet Harman, Minister of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, gave due consideration to this claim. The claim was dismissed by Lord Falconer, despite a 30-year campaign by Paul FitzGerald's family reputedly costing ¬£1.3 million. The Lord Chancellor adjudicated that the title was to remain with the existing holder, Maurice FitzGerald. Paul FitzGerald has a right of appeal against the Lord Chancellor's verdict by petitioning Queen Elizabeth II.American loses battle over Leinster dukedom claim - website IrishAbroad In 2010, however, DNA evidence was presented that indicates that Paul FitzGerald is related to the wife of the 5th Duke, the former Lady Hermione Duncombe. As reported in The Scotsman, \\"with the help of Dunfermline-based genealogist Lloyd Pitcairn, Mrs FitzGerald Caudill [Paul FitzGerald's aunt] traced Maud Crawford, the grand-daughter of Lady Hermione's younger sister Urica [sic] Duncombe. The results of the tests found that it was '41 times more probable' that Ms Crawford and Paul FitzGerald were extremely closely related than were from different families. The evidence that Paul FitzGerald is related to the family of the 5th Duke's wife is the first DNA evidence ever produced in the case, and may support Mrs FitzGerald Caudhill's long-held claim suggesting that her mysterious father was the son of Lady Hermione, the wife of the fifth Duke of Leinster.\\" Theresa Pamella Caudill died in 2016. It had also previously been alleged that Edward FitzGerald, who succeeded as 7th Duke, was the biological son of Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857-1937).Angela Lambert, Unquiet Souls (Harper & Row, 1984), p. 64 Were this to be established, then neither the present Duke nor any other descendant of his grandfather the 7th Duke, would be a legitimate heir of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster.

from the legend that John FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare, as a baby in Woodstock Castle, was trapped in a fire when a pet monkey rescued him. The FitzGeralds then adopted a monkey as their crest (and later supporters) and occasionally use the additional motto Non immemor beneficii (Not forgetful of a helping hand). The motto \\"Crom A Boo\\" comes from the medieval Croom Castle and \\"Abu\\", meaning \\"up\\" in Irish; Crom Abu was the FitzGeralds' medieval warcry. Crom (Croom) and Shanet (Shanid) were two castles about 16 miles apart in Co Limerick, one being the seat of the Geraldines of Kildare, and the other that of the Geraldines of Desmond, whose distinctive war cries were accordingly ‚ÄúCrom-a-boo‚Äù and ‚ÄúShanet-a-boo.‚Äù In 1495 an act of Parliament was passed (10 Hen. VII. C. 20) ‚Äúto abolish the words Crom-a-boo and Butler-a-boo.‚Äù The word ‚ÄúAbu‚Äù or ‚ÄúAboo,‚Äù an exclamation of defiance, was the usual termination of the war cries in Ireland, as in a' buaidh, \\"to victory!\\"Complete Peerage.

History The descendants of Hiberno-Norman lords who had settled in Ireland in the 12th century had been significantly Gaelicised by the end of the Middle Ages, forming septs and clans after the indigenous Gaelic pattern, and became known as the Gall or \\"Old English\\" (contrasting with the \\"New English\\" arriving with the Tudor conquest of Ireland). The Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, complained that \\" ... now many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies\\".The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4‚Äì7) The phrase (in Latin) was used by the Irish priest and historian John Lynce (c1599‚Äì1677) in his work Cambrensis Eversus.Se√°n O'Faol√°in, The Irish (Penguin 1947), p. 59 He was strongly influenced by the writings of the historian Geoffrey Keating (1569 ‚Äì c. 1644), whose History of Ireland he translated into Latin. Cambrensis Eversus was translated from the Latin, with notes and observations, by Theophilus O'Flanagan, Dublin, 1795. Eighteenth-century use John Henry Wilson, in his Sketch of Jonathan Swift (1804), wrote that Swift used the phrase (Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis) in a discussion with his landlord. Nineteenth-century use Buttevant Friary. Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond (known in Irish as Gear√≥id Iarla) was a prime example of the Gaelicisation of the Hiberno- Normans. The phrase remained in use by romantic nineteenth-century nationalists to promote the common Irishness of 'Planter and Gael'. An example is found in the 1844 poem by the Young Irelander, Thomas Davis called 'The Geraldines', which concerns the FitzGerald dynasty:\\"The Geraldines\\". UCC Modern use The phrase remains in common use, both colloquially and in the media, in reference to recent immigration and assimilation in Ireland, and to some degree about some of the Irish diaspora (for example in The Irish Times, Senator Jim Walsh, Liam Twomey, or Irish Emigrant) or in conversation discussing the relationship between the cultural heritage of the Irish diaspora and the Irish in Ireland. While still echoing its original meaning, contemporary usage of the phrase usually takes a more open interpretation of assimilation or, in the case of the diaspora, the maintenance of Irish heritage. Debates of the Oireachtas demonstrate the age and range of contemporary applications of the phrase. Either when discussing the diaspora: Or, more light-heartedly, on assimilation: However, S. J. Connolly has written, \\"The descendants of the English conquerors, it was confidently proclaimed, had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves'. Today it is recognized that the supposedly contemporary phrase dates only from the late eighteenth century, the Latin form (Hiberniores ipsis Hibernis) sometimes used to give it an authentic medieval ring from later still.\\" See also * More German than the Germans * Plastic Paddy * West Brit ‚Äì a somewhat opposite expression Notes Lordship of Ireland Irish culture Cultural assimilation English phrases Historiography of Ireland Words and phrases introduced in the 18th century ","title":"More Irish than the Irish themselves"},{"id":"244233","title":"Vezina Trophy"},{"id":"244239","text":"The Oregon Country Fair (OCF) is a nonprofit organization and an annual three- day art and music fair held outside the city limits of Veneta, Oregon, United States. Located in the Willamette Valley, the site is about west of Eugene along the Long Tom River near the unincorporated community of Elmira. Annual attendance is approximately 45,000, and the fair has around 960 craft and food booths each year. The event is known as an outgrowth of the counter-culture movement and for using environmentally-friendly practices during the fair. The Oregon Country Fair begins on the Friday of the second weekend in July every year (i.e. as early as July 7 and as late as July 13). The fair is a non- profit organization and as such has a board of directors. Additionally, the management structure of the Oregon Country Fair is typically composed of a General Manager, an Operations Manager, and a team of volunteer Back Up Managers, otherwise known as BUMS, who serve as representation for the fair's paid management staff for the duration of the event. Currently the fair does not have an official General Manager. In the interim, management responsibilities fall to the Operations Manager and the Site Manager who work as a co-management team. Community Village, 2005 Fair Patriotic paraders, 2008 History The first fair was held in Eugene over the weekend of November 1‚Äì2, 1969. It was promoted with the tagline, \\"come in costume\\". The fair began as a craft fair to raise funds for an alternative school, the Children's Community School. The event moved to its current location in Veneta, about 13 miles west of Eugene, for the fall fair in October, 1970, after having had a May Fair the same year on Crow Road about halfway between Eugene and Veneta. In August 1972 and August 1982, OCF hosted concerts headlined by the Grateful Dead. Known as \\"Field Trips\\", the first concert was held as a benefit for the Springfield Creamery, which is owned by members of Ken Kesey's family. Until 1977, the fair was known as the Oregon Renaissance Faire. The 52nd was deferred to 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame for 2020's cancellation.

There is also a drum circle at the Drum Tower which is open to all willing participants who bring their musical instruments. Tickets and transportation Tickets and passes are required to attend the Oregon Country Fair. All tickets sold to the public are sold in advance at TicketsWest outlets and other retail centers throughout the Northwest. All tickets must be purchased off-site; no tickets are sold at the fair site. Discount tickets are available for people who qualify for disability or senior discounts. There is no fee for children who are under the age of ten and come with a paying adult. Public transportation, in the form of bus shuttle, provides a park and ride service between Eugene and the OCF grounds non-stop throughout the days of the fair. Culture The fair is a family event with face painting, puppet shows, and music for children. Toplessness is permitted while full nudity is not allowed during public hours in public areas. No alcohol is allowed, and smoking is limited to designated areas. The fair has its own water and communications systems, recycling service, emergency medical team, traffic control, and security team. Since 1997 there has been a strong effort to make it a drug-free event. Infrastructure The fair is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It is governed by an elected ten-member Board of Directors (with 2 elected alternates). There are seven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions traditionally include a General Manager, an Operations Manager, an Assistant Manager, A Site and Facilities Manager, a Residential Caretaker, a Groundskeeper, and an Administrative Assistant. Currently the fair does not have a General Manager. Until a full-time General Manager is hired by the Board of Directors, the Site and Facilities Manager and Operations Manager share management responsibilities and authority within the organization. Alter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), Community Village, Solutions, and all Information booths.http://www.oregoncountryfair.org From June 1 through August 31 there are no dogs (except service dogs) allowed on the event site. Publications The Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year. As well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three- day event. Volunteer crews The Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. While some working volunteers receive food vouchers, which can be used to buy meals from vendors during the event, many volunteers do not. Volunteer crews are separated into \\"Pre-fair Crews\\" and \\"During Fair Crews.\\" Pre-fair crews work from the site's opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public on the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site's physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager. All volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of The Oregon Country Fair is: History of the land The Willamette Valley has been continuously occupied by humans, to some extent, for at least the last 9,000-10,000 years (this timeline is based on the archaeological evidence gathered from 34 archaeological sites in the Upper Willamette Valley).A Chronology of Upper Willamette Valley, Oregon, Prehistory John R. White American Antiquity, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Jul., 1979), pp. 401-640 The banks of the Long Tom River decorated for the fair, as seen from the \\"eight\\" (the main path through the fair) The Oregon Country Fair property includes archaeological sites protected by state law. It is thought to have previously been a gathering place for the Kalapuya tribe of Native Americans. All ground disturbing activities on the fair property must be approved by the archaeology and construction crews. The Kalapuya lived in permanent winter homes and migrated throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the summers. Subsistence was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering wild plant foods.Thomas A. Green,. 2006. \\"THE POWERS THAT BE: SACRED TALES.\\" In The Greenwood Library of American Folktales Volume 4: The Northwest The American Indian Experience. Based on the translation of Kalapuya texts, strong historical aspects of the Kalapuya culture include: the dream, the dream spirit-power, death, wealth, prestige, sexual division of labor (men hunt, women gather), sex, acculturation, and language. The dream spirit-power was observed to be the strongest. The dream power was constantly referred to in matters of courage and bravery, of sickness and resisting disease, gambling, hunting, wealth, casting spells, power over natural phenomena and becoming a shaman.Ethnolinguistic Observations Based on Kalapuya Texts J. P. Rumberger, Jr.International Journal of American Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Jul., 1949), pp. 139-19 Much of the fair site is a wetland and the Long Tom River floods much of the fair property each winter. Educational areas Energy Park Young attendees Some of the Oregon Country Fair's areas are organized to be information and workshop resources. The Kids Loop is a children's play area, Yes You Canopy is a pavilion dedicated to the teaching of juggling, Energy Park is an area with displays and demonstrations on alternative energy, alternative transportation, organic agriculture and recycling, and Community Village has booths from non-profit organizations dedicated to education, information access, plants and gardening, including a display by the Oregon State University/Lane County Extension Master Gardeners, and other forms of progressive social change. Archaeology Park (\\"Ark Park\\") is the home of the fair's archaeology crew, and includes replica cedar houses like those used by Pacific Northwest Native American tribes, displays of artifacts and photos of archaeological digs from the fair site, and hands-on demonstrations of flintknapping, firemaking, basket weaving and other Native American skills. Philanthropy The OCF organization maintains close ties with the Eugene- area community and supports many other nonprofit organizations through its philanthropic programs. Fairgoers, fair working volunteers, and the OCF organization alike contribute to non-profit groups through The Jill Heiman Vision Fund. This fund grants funds to tax-exempt organizations in Lane County. Donations are provided to projects and programs related to improving the environment and fostering sustainability. The OCF Board has created The Bill Wooten Endowment Fund to assist arts, environmental, and social justice projects. The Board of Directors also offers donations to various groups and activities that share its values of living artfully and authentically on the earth.

His ministry received much of the blame for Britain's loss of thirteen American colonies. His issuance of detailed instructions in military matters, coupled with his failure to understand either the geography of the colonies or the determination of the colonists, may justify this conclusion. He had two careers. His military career had distinction, but ended with a court martial. Sackville served in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, including at the decisive Battle of Minden. His political career ended with the fall of the North government in March 1782. Background and education Sackville was the third son of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-General Walter Philip Colyear. His Godfather George I attended his baptism.Weintraub p.31 He was educated at Westminster School in London and graduated from Trinity College in Dublin in 1737.Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin (1593-1860) George Dames Burtchaell/Thomas Ulick Sadleir p727: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935 Between 1730 and 1737 and again from 1750 to 1755, his father held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. While in Dublin he befriended the celebrated writer Jonathan Swift.Weintraub p.31 He also encountered Lord Ligonier who would later assist his career in the military.Weintraub p.31 He then entered the army. Sackville was elected Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1751, serving in this post for the next two years. Family He married Diana Sambrooke, daughter of John Sambrooke and Elizabeth Forester, on 3 September 1754. They had two sons and three daughters, including: *Diana Sackville (8 July 1756 ‚Äì 29 August 1814). *Charles Sackville (27 August 1767 ‚Äì 29 July 1843), later changed his name to Charles Sackville-Germain. *George Sackville (7 December 1770 - 31 May 1836) *Elizabeth, married Henry Herbert, MP Early military career Sackville started as a captain in the 7th Horse (later the 6th Dragoon Guards). In 1740, he transferred to the Gloucestershire Regiment of Foot as a lieutenant colonel. The regiment was sent to Germany to participate in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1743. Sackville was advanced to brevet colonel. =Battle of Fontenoy= The Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 where Sackville first distinguished himself. He was wounded and captured by the French. He saw his first battle, leading the charge of the Duke of Cumberland's infantry in the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. He led his regiment so deep into the French lines that when he was wounded and captured he was taken to the tent of Louis XV.Weintraub p.30-31 When he was released and returned home, it was to duty in Scotland as the Colonel of the 20th Foot Regiment. In 1747 and 1748, he again joined the Duke of Cumberland. He became colonel of the 7th Irish horse and served in Holland. There was a break in his military career between wars (1750-1755) when he served as first secretary to his father. During the Seven Years' War, Sackville returned to active military service. He had been considered for the post of Commander-in-Chief in North America, which eventually went to Edward Braddock who led his force to disaster during the Braddock Campaign.Weintraub p.32 In 1755, he was promoted to major general and returned to active service to oversee ordnance. In 1758, he was given a fourth regiment and joined the Duke of Marlborough as a lieutenant general. He was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1758. =Raid on St Malo= In June 1758 Sackville was second in command of a British expedition led by Marlborough which attempted an amphibious Raid on St Malo. While it failed to take the town as instructed, the raid was still considered to have been largely successful as a diversion. Follow-up raids were considered against Le Havre, Caen and other targets in Normandy but no further landings were attempted and the force returned home. Later in 1758 they joined the allied forces of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany, with the first detachment of British troops sent to the Continent. When Marlborough died, Sackville became Commander of the British contingent of the army, although still under the overall command of the Duke of Brunswick. Battle of Minden In the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, British and Hanoverian infantry of the centre made an advance on the French cavalry and artillery in that sector. They apparently went in without orders and their attacking line formation even repulsed repeated French cavalry charges, holding until the last moment then firing a massive volley when the charge came within ten yards. As the disrupted French began to fall back on Minden, Ferdinand called for a British cavalry charge to complete the victory, but Sackville withheld permission for their advance. Ferdinand sent his order several times, but Sackville was estranged from Lord Granby, the force commander. He continued to withhold permission for Granby to gain glory through an attack. For this action, he was cashiered and sent home. Granby replaced him as commander of the British contingent for the remainder of the war. =Court martial= Sackville refused to accept responsibility for refusing to obey orders. Back in England, he demanded a court martial, and made it a large enough issue that he obtained his demand in 1760. The court found him guilty, and imposed one of the strangest and strongest verdicts ever rendered against a general officer. The court's verdict not only upheld his discharge, but ruled that he was \\"...unfit to serve His Majesty in any military Capacity whatever.\\", then ordered that their verdict be read to and entered in the orderly book of every regiment in the army.The Proceedings of a General Court-Martial ‚Ä¶ upon the trial of Lord George Sackville (London: 1760), p. 224 The king had his name struck from the Privy Council rolls. Early political career In The State Tinkers (1780), James Gillray caricatured Germain (second from left) and his political allies as incompetent tinkers of the National Kettle. Posted on the wall behind Germain is the \\"Plan of Minden\\". Sackville had been a Member of Parliament at intervals since 1733. He had served terms in both the Dublin and the Westminster bodies, sometimes simultaneously, but had not taken sides in political wrangles. Between 1750 and 1755 he served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, during his father's second term as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. When George III took the throne in 1760, Sackville began his political rehabilitation. There did not seem to be negative repercussions to the European stalemate of the Seven Years' War. The victories over the French within the colonial empire provided a chance for events of the war to be forgotten. The difficulty of repaying the debts incurred to fight the war caused a period of unstable ministries and shifting political alliances. In 1765, King George quietly returned him to the rolls of the Privy Council. Drayton House Initially he was a follower of George Grenville's faction but he increasingly lined up as a supporter of Lord North and, in 1769, he made this alliance formal. Then, in 1769, Lady Elizabeth Germain died without natural heirs, and left her estates, including Drayton, Northamptonshire, to him. This not only improved his finances, it also gave him the chance to take that name formally. After 1770, he was known as Lord George Germain. Secretary of State =Appointment= On 10 November 1775, Germain was appointed Secretary of State for the American Department replacing Lord Dartmouth in the post.Weintraub p.26 At that time, North's cabinet had three secretaries of state; one each for Europe (the Northern Department), America, and the rest of the world (the Southern Department). Besides international relations, these secretaries were responsible for a great deal of Colonial administration and for military operations within their area. This made Germain the primary minister responsible for suppressing the rebellion that had broken out in 1775 in the colonies. He promoted or relieved Generals, took care of provisions and supplies, and became involved with the strategic planning of the war. =American War of Independence= Sackville and Lord North made three assumptions about the war they were about to face: firstly, the American forces could not withstand the assaults of the British; secondly, the war would be similar to wars they had fought successfully in Europe; and lastly, their victory would bring about their goal of having the colonies' allegiance. All of their assumptions proved to be false, with the limited and unhelpful exception of the first, in that the American forces usually could not withstand the assaults of the British in open battle but instead adopted other, more successful, tactics. In 1776 he worked with General Burgoyne to plan, support and issue orders for the Saratoga campaign. However, his unclear orders to General Howe contributed to the campaign's failure. Following the entry of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic into the conflict, British emphasis shifted to focus increasingly on a global war. British troops were withdrawn from Philadelphia and reinforcements were sent to the valuable sugar-producing West Indies. In 1779 one of Germain's associates, Richard Cumberland was sent to Madrid for talks designed to reach a separate peace settlement with Spain, but this attempt failed. =Yorktown= In 1781, the confusion involving orders sent to Cornwallis from Clinton contributed to the loss at Yorktown. The news of Yorktown reached London on 25 November 1781 and the messenger went first to Germain's residence at Pall Mall.Whiteley p.195 Germain then went to tell other ministers. Together they went to Lord North who reportedly cried out \\"Oh God - It's all over\\". It was agreed that Germain, rather than North, should take the news to the King who was at Kew.Whiteley p.195-196 The King's Speech two days later had to be re-written in light of Yorktown. News of the surrender galvanised the Opposition and government majorities began to shrink over the following months with calls for resignations of senior ministers. Germain drew up a plan to continue the war using the existing British bases in Charleston, New York, Savannah and Canada to harass the American coastline and frontiers.Weintraub p.308 He also advocated re-occupying Newport in Rhode Island to give a foothold in New England. =Departure from office= Germain became a target for the opposition, and was eventually persuaded to step down in exchange for a peerage, and in February 1782 he was made Baron Bolebrooke, in the County of Sussex, and Viscount Sackville, of Drayton in the County of Northampton. This was considered essential if the North government was to survive by bringing in factions of the opposition, to whom Germain was personally objectionable. He was replaced by Welbore Ellis. In spite of Germain's departure, the North government fell shortly afterwards in February 1782 and was followed by a period of political instability. Shortly after the fall of the North government, news arrived of the decisive British naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes in the Caribbean, which would have boosted the government had it still been in power.Fleming p. 155 The Shelburne government agreed to the Peace of Paris, bringing an end to the war in 1783 and recognising the independence of the United States. Later life Stoneland Lodge, Sussex The controversy over Lord Sackville's handling of the war continued. Some members were opposed to his taking a seat in the House of Lords, an almost unprecedented incident. In spite of this he was admitted to the Lords, where he was staunchly defended by Lord Thurlow, and his declining health soon made the issue irrelevant. He retired to his country home at Stoneland Lodge and died there in 1785. He maintained to his dying day that he had not been a coward at Minden. Following his death, a defence of Sackville's reputation, The character of the late Viscount Sackville, was written by Richard Cumberland. The Drayton House estate passed to his son Charles, who later became the 5th (and last) Duke of Dorset. The Stoneland estate (or Buckhurst Park as it came to be known) passed via the wife of the late 3rd Duke of Dorset to her daughter Countess de la Warr on the Dowager Duchess's death in 1825.

He was made a Marshal of the Empire by Emperor Napoleon I in 1804 and he also fought in the Napoleonic Wars. After 1815, he became reconciled to the Bourbon Restoration. Jourdan was one of the most successful commanders of the French Revolutionary Army, but is notable for his decisive defeat at the Battle of Vitoria which resulted in the French Empire's permanent loss of Spain. Early life and career Born at Limoges, France into a surgeon's family, Jourdan enlisted in the French Royal Army in early 1778 when he was not quite sixteen. Assigned to the Regiment of Auxerrois, he participated in the ill-fated assault at the Siege of Savannah on 9 October 1779 during the American War of Independence. After service in the West Indies, he returned home in 1782 sick with a fever. Bouts of illness (possibly chlamydiaceae) troubled him for the rest of his life. In 1784, Jourdan was discharged from the army and set up a haberdashery business in Limoges. He married a dressmaker in 1788 and the couple had five daughters.Glover-Chandler, p 158 War of the First Coalition Jourdan as a lieutenant colonel of the 2e battalion de la Haute- Vienne in 1792 Battle of Fleurus, won by Jourdan over the Austrian forces led by the princes of Coburg and Orange on 26 June 1794 When the National Assembly asked for volunteers, Jourdan was elected Chef de bataillon of the 2nd Haute-Vienne Battalion of volunteers. He led his troops in the French victory at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792 and in the defeat at the Battle of Neerwinden on 18 March 1793. Jourdan's leadership skills were noticed and led to his promotion to g√©n√©ral de brigade on 27 May 1793 and to g√©n√©ral de division two months later. On 8 September, he led his division at the Battle of Hondschoote, in which he was wounded in the chest. On 22 September, he was named to lead the Army of the North.Glover-Chandler, p 159 Three of his predecessors, Nicolas Luckner, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, and Jean Nicolas Houchard were under arrest and later executed by guillotine. Jourdan's first assignment was to relieve General Jacques Ferrand's 20,000-man garrison of Maubeuge which was besieged by an Austrian-Dutch army commanded by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The Committee of Public Safety felt that this mission was so important that it dispatched Lazare Carnot to oversee the operation. Jourdan defeated Coburg on 15‚Äì16 October at the Battle of Wattignies and broke the siege. Carnot claimed that it was his own intervention that won the victory. Historian Michael Glover writes that the first day's attack was a failure because of Carnot's interference, while the second day's success resulted from Jourdan using his own tactical judgment. In any case, only Carnot's account reached Paris.Glover-Chandler, p 160 On 10 January 1794, after refusing to carry out an impossible order, Jourdan was brought before the Committee of Public Safety. Carnot presented Jourdan's arrest warrant, which was signed by Maximilien de Robespierre, Bertrand Bar√®re, and Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois. Jourdan was saved from certain execution when an eyewitness, Representative on mission Ernest Joseph Duquesnoy rose and contradicted Carnot's version of events at Wattignies. Spared from arrest, Jourdan was nevertheless dismissed from the army and sent home.Glover-Chandler, pp 160‚Äì161 The government soon recalled Jourdan to lead the Army of the Moselle. In May, he was ordered north with the left wing of the Army of the Moselle. This force was combined with the Army of the Ardennes and the right wing of the Army of the North to form an army which did not officially become the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse until 29 June 1794. With 70,000 soldiers of the new army, Jourdan laid siege to Charleroi on 12 June. A 41,000-man Austrian-Dutch army under the Prince of Orange defeated the French at the Battle of Lambusart on 16 June and drove them south of the Sambre River. Casualties numbered 3,000 for each army.Smith, pp 84‚Äì85 Undeterred, Jourdan immediately marched on Namur to the east-northeast of Charleroi. Instead of attacking Namur, he suddenly swung west and appeared to the north of Charleroi. After a brief siege, the 3,000-man Austrian garrison of Charleroi surrendered on 25 June.Smith, pp 85‚Äì86 Military strategist B. H. Liddell Hart cited Jourdan's maneuver as an example of the indirect approach, even though it was probably inadvertent on the French general's part.Liddell- Hart, p 97 Too late to save Charlerloi, Coburg's 46,000-strong army attacked Jourdan's 75,000 French on 26 June. The Battle of Fleurus proved to be a strategic French victory when Coburg called off his attacks and retreated.Smith, pp 86‚Äì87 During the battle, the Allied attacks pushed back both French flanks, but Jourdan stubbornly fought it out and was saved when General Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre's division held its ground in the center.Glover-Chandler, pp 161‚Äì162 After Fleurus, the Allied position in the Austrian Netherlands collapsed. The Austrian Army evacuated Belgium and the Dutch Republic was dissolved by the advancing French armies in 1795. On 7 June 1795, Jourdan's army concluded the long but successful Siege of Luxembourg.Smith, p 103 Operations east of the Rhine were less successful that year, with the French capturing, then losing Mannheim.Smith, pp 104‚Äì107 In the Rhine campaign of 1796, Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse formed the left wing of the advance into Bavaria. The whole of the French forces were ordered to advance on Vienna, Jourdan on the extreme left, General Jean Victor Marie Moreau in the centre by the Danube valley, and Napoleon on the right in Italy. The campaign began brilliantly, with the Austrians under Archduke Charles being driven back by Moreau and Jourdan almost to the Austrian frontier. But Charles, slipping away from Moreau, threw his whole weight on Jourdan, who was defeated at the Battle of Amberg in August. Jourdan failed to salvage the situation at the Battle of W√ºrzburg and was forced over the Rhine after the Battle of Limburg, which cost the life of General Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau. Moreau had to fall back in turn, and the operations of the year in Germany were a failure. The chief cause of defeat was the plan of campaign imposed upon the generals by their government. Jourdan was nevertheless made the scapegoat and was not employed for two years. In those years he became prominent as a politician and above all as the framer of the famous conscription law of 1798, which came to be known as the Jourdan law.Britannica, Jourdan War of the Second Coalition When war was renewed in 1799, Jourdan was at the head of the army on the Rhine, but again suffered defeat at the hands of Archduke Charles at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in late March. Disappointed and broken in health, he handed over command to General Andr√© Mass√©na. He resumed his political duties and was a prominent opponent of the Coup of 18 Brumaire, after which he was expelled from the Council of Five Hundred. Soon, however, he became formally reconciled to the new r√©gime, and accepted from Napoleon fresh military and civil employment. In 1800, Jourdan became inspector-general of cavalry and infantry and representative of French interests in the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic Wars and later life In 1804, Napoleon appointed Jourdan as a Marshal of the Empire. He remained in the newly created Kingdom of Italy until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte, whom his brother made King of Naples that year, selected Jourdan as his military adviser. He followed Joseph into Spain in 1808; but Joseph's throne had to be maintained by the French Army, and throughout the Peninsular War, the other marshals, who depended directly upon Napoleon, paid little heed either to Joseph or to Jourdan. Jourdan was blamed for the defeat at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 and replaced by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. He was reinstated as Joseph's chief of staff in September 1811, but given few troops.Glover-Chandler, pp 164-165 After the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Joseph and Jourdan were forced to abandon Madrid and retreat to Valencia. Joining with Soult's army, which evacuated Andalusia, the French were able to recapture Madrid during the Siege of Burgos and push Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese army back to Portugal. The following year, Wellington advanced again with a large, well-organized army. Repeatedly outmaneuvering the French, the Anglo-Allied army forced Joseph and Jourdan to fight at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. After the decisive French defeat, which resulted in the permanent loss of Spain, Jourdan held no important commands up to the fall of the French Empire. He adhered to the Bourbon Restoration of 1814, and though he rejoined Napoleon in the Hundred Days and commanded a minor army, he submitted to the Bourbons again after the Battle of Waterloo. Jourdan refused to be a member of the court which sentenced Marshal Michel Ney to death. He was made a count, a Peer of France in 1819, and governor of Grenoble in 1816. In politics, Jourdan was a prominent opponent of the royalist reactionaries and supported the revolution of 1830. After this event, he held the portfolio of foreign affairs for a few days and then became governor of the Invalides, where his last years were spent. Jourdan died in Paris on 23 November 1833 and was buried in Les Invalides. While in exile on Saint Helena, Napoleon admitted, > I certainly used that man very ill ... I have learned with pleasure that > since my fall he invariably acted in the best manner.

Though not one of the most well known figures of the French Revolution, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne was an instrumental figure of the period known as the Reign of Terror. Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during that period, becoming one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety. He was recognized and worked with French Revolution figures Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre, and is often considered one of the key architects of The Terror. \\"No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the Revolution will triumph or we will all die.\\"Simon Schama. Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (New York: Vintage Books, 1989), 809, 840. Biography =Early life= Billaud-Varenne was born in La Rochelle as the son of a lawyer to the parlement of Paris. Since both his grandfather and father were lawyers, and he was the first son in his direct family, Varenne was guaranteed a solid education and the same profession. Billaud-Varenne was educated at the College of Oratorians of Niort and took Philosophy at La Rochelle. His education at Niort was particularly important in shaping his character because its methods of teaching were uncommon to the revolution. At Niort, modernity and tolerance were emphasized, as opposed to overbearing and possibly obstructive religious instruction present in most other schools of the time. Billaud-Varenne was also sent to Oratory school at Juilly, where he later became a professor when he felt dissatisfied with practicing law. Here he remained for a short while, until his writing of a com√©die strained his relationship with those who ran the school and he was obliged to leaveLevitine, George. Culture and Revolution: Cultural Ramifications of the French Revolution (College Park, Maryland: Department of Art History, 1989), 70-79. in 1785, the Oratorian college where he was Hall prefect of studies. He then went to Paris, married and bought a position as lawyer in the parlement. In early 1789 he published at Amsterdam a three-volume work on the Despotisme des ministres de la France as well as a well received anti-clerical text titled \\"The Last Blow Against Prejudice and Superstition.\\"Palmer, 1949, 12 As events moved closer towards Bastille Day, he adopted with enthusiasm the principles of the Revolution. An example of his beliefs regarding the Church can be found in this text: \\"However painful an amputation may be, when a member is gangrened it must be sacrificed if we wish to save the body.\\"Palmer, 1949, 12 =Early activism= Jean Nicolas Billaud- Varenne Joining the Jacobin Club, Billaud-Varenne became, from 1790, one of the most violent anti-Royalist orators, closely linked to Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois. After the flight to Varennes of King Louis XVI, he published a pamphlet, L'Ac√©phocratie, in which he demanded the establishment of a federal republic. On 1 July, in another speech at the Jacobin Club, he spoke of a republic, arousing the derision of partisans of the constitutional monarchy. But when he repeated his demand for a republic a fortnight later, the speech was printed and sent to the Jacobin branch societies throughout France. On the night of 10 August 1792 (during the attack on the Tuileries Palace) he met with Danton, Desmoulins, and other members of the Insurrectionary Commune during the critical hours before the overthrow of the monarchy. Later that day, he was elected one of the deputy-commissioners of the sections who shortly afterwards became the general council of the Paris Commune. He was accused of having been an accomplice in the September Massacres in the Abbaye prison. =Projects in the Convention= Elected, like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Collot d'Herbois, a deputy of Paris to the National Convention, he spoke in favour of the immediate abolition of the Bourbon monarchy, and the next day demanded that all acts be dated from the Year I of the French Republic (a measure adopted a little over a year later in the form of the French Revolutionary Calendar). At the trial of Louis XVI he added new charges to the accusation, proposed to refuse counsel to the king, and voted for death \\"within 24 hours\\". On 2 June 1793, in the context of Jean-Paul Marat's anti-Girondist instigations, he proposed a decree of accusation against the Girondists; a week later, at the Jacobin Club, he outlined a programme which the Convention was to fulfil soon after: the expulsion of foreigners, the establishment of a tax on the rich, the deprivation of the rights of citizenship of all \\"anti-social\\" men, the creation of a French Revolutionary Army, the monitoring of all officers and ci-devant nobles (i.e.: those of aristocratic families who no longer held status after the abolition of feudalism), and the death penalty for unsuccessful generals fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars. =Mission and Reign of Terror= On 15 July he made a violent speech in the Convention in accusation of the Girondists. Sent in August as representative on mission to the d√©partements of the Nord and of Pas-de-Calais, he showed himself inexorable to all suspects. On his return, the calamities of the summer of 1793 caused the Paris Commune to begin to organize an insurrection - an insurrection that would lead to Billaud- Varenne's ascension to the most powerful body in all of France. When the popular uprising did come on 5 September and the Commune marched on the National Convention, Billaud-Varenne was one of the chief speakers agitating for change in leadership. He called for a new war plan from the Ministry of War and that a new Committee be created to oversee the whole government - thus superseding the existing Committee of Public Safety.Palmer, 1949, 48 To mollify the insurrectionists, that night Billaud-Varenne was named President of the National Convention for a special two week session, followed by him being named to the Committee of Public Safety the next day.Palmer, 1949, 54 Along with Collot d'Herbois, who was named the same day, his addition was seen as a way to co-opt the Paris Commune.Schama, 1989, 766 Once added to Committee of Public Safety, he then played a major role in defending it - calling for unity instead of change - on 25 October when the National Convention complained about the Committee and then officially sanctioned them. He was included in the Reign of Terror's Committee of Public Safety, which had decreed the mass arrest of all suspects and the establishment of a revolutionary army, caused the extraordinary criminal tribunal to be named officially \\"Revolutionary Tribunal\\" (on 29 October 1793), demanded the execution of Marie Antoinette, and then attacked Jacques Ren√© H√©bert and Danton. Meanwhile, he published Les √âl√©ments du r√©publicanisme, in which he demanded a division of property among the citizens. Once named to the Committee, Billaud-Varenne became a vocal defender of that body. Based in Paris during much of this year, Billaud-Varenne and Bar√®re worked to develop the administrative apparatus and consolidate the power of the Committee. To that end, in early December he proposed a radical centralization of authority, a law that became known as the Law of 14 Frimaire. This law brought surveillance, economic requisition, the dispatch of legislative news, local administrators, and representatives on mission under the control of the Committee.Palmer, 1949, 124-127 He was also instrumental in defending the Terror: when a measure was passed into law in mid November 1793 allowing the accused the right of defense, Billaud-Varenne uttered his famous words in defense of the Terror: \\"No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the revolution will triumph or we will all die.\\" The law enabling right of defense was overturned the next day.Schama, 1989, 809 =Thermidor and exile= Billaud-varenne As 1794 progressed, Robespierre began to speak out against over zealous factions: he believed both pro-Terror and indulgent positions were dangerous to the well-being of the Revolution. Robespierre saw danger in members of the Revolution, like Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier who had been too committed to attacks on Church property or had been too vigorous in their pursuit of revolutionary justice (such as Collot at Lyon). The deChristianization program was seen as divisive and unnecessary by some in the Convention. Furthermore, the law of 22 Prairial had isolated the police wing of the Convention: the Committee of General Security, a body that was extremely anti-clerical, had seen their power severely diminished by the law.Palmer, 1949, 368-369 The law of 22 Prairial reduced the right of defense to simply an appearance before court, while greatly expanding the list of crimes punishable by death. This is what led directly to the Great Terror, in which more were killed by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris in those seven weeks than in the preceding fourteen months. Though Billaud-Varenne publicly defended it in the Convention, this law was a driving factor in the eventual reprisal against the Committee.Palmer,1949,366-369 Serious arguments began to fracture the Committee, with Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois pitted against Robespierre and Saint-Just. On 26 June, they argued over the imposition of a new prosecutor to the Revolutionary Tribunal. On 29 June, an argument once again broke out between members of the Committee of Public Safety. Though it could have been about the Catherine Th√©ot affair or the law of 22 Prairial, it led to Billaud-Varenne branding Robespierre a dictator and the latter storming out of the Committee headquarters and ceasing to attend meetings.Palmer, 1949, 369 With tensions being heightened and more guillotined every day - the rate of executions per day in Paris rose from five a day in Germinal to twenty-six a day in Messidor - Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois began to fear for their safety.Schama, 1989, 837 Throughout the early days of Thermidor, Bertrand Bar√®re attempted to forge compromise between the splintering Committee.Palmer, 1949, 379 However, Robespierre was still convinced that the Convention needed further purging, and on 8 Thermidor he rose before that body to give a speech that would spark the Thermidorian Reaction.Schama, 1989, 841 Speaking of \\"monsters\\" that threatened the Republic with conspiracy, his speech was pointed enough to serve as a warning while being vague enough to worry many in the body.Schama, 1989, 842 When he was asked for the names of those in the conspiracy, Robespierre declined to provide them, and he was charged with indicting members of the Convention en masse without a hearing.Schama, 1989, 842 That night, Robespierre retreated to the Jacobin Club, where he gave the same speech to rousing applause. Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, as members who the speech may have been aimed at, attempted to defend themselves but were shouted down and expelled from the club as cries for \\"la guillotine,\\" rained down upon them.Palmer, 1949, 374 They returned to the Committee of Public Safety where they found Saint-Just, the protege of Robespierre, working on a speech he intended to deliver the next day. As one of the chief messengers of the terror, Collot and Billaud-Varenne both assumed that Saint-Just was writing their denunciation. At this moment the last argument of the Committee erupted, with Collot, Billaud-Varenne, and Bar√®re attacking Saint-Just for \\"dividing the nation.\\" After sometime, they departed the Committee and organized the last elements of the Thermidorian Reaction.Palmer, 1949. 374 The next day, 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne would play a critical role in the final stroke against Robespierre and his allies. As Saint-Just delivered his speech, he was interrupted near the beginning by another conspirator, Jean-Lambert Tallien. Billaud-Varenne was next to speak, with Collot d'Herbois controlling the debates from the President's Chair, and in an eloquent planned denunciation directly accused Robespierre of a conspiracy against the Republic.Palmer, 1949, 377 This speech and others were warmly received, and after continued debate arrest warrants were issued for Robespierre, Saint-Just, and their allies. After a brief armed standoff, the conspirators would carry the day, and Robespierre and his allies would be executed the next day.Schama, 1989, 846 However, after 9 Thermidor, Billaud- Varenne was soon enough to find himself in prison. Too closely associated with the excesses of the Reign of Terror, he was shortly attacked himself in the Convention for his ruthlessness, and a commission was appointed to examine his conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee of Public Safety. Billaud-Varenne was arrested, and as a result of the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation to French Guiana, along with Collot d'Herbois and Bertrand Bar√®re de Vieuzac. After Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup, he refused the pardon offered by the French Consulate. In 1816 he left Guiana, went to New York City for a few months, and finally took refuge in Port-au-Prince (Haiti), where he died of dysentery.

The Lincolnshire Trust suggest it is an artificial island, and a report from 1979 says that it was reclaimed. However, the site was for many years a large sandbank going by the name of \\"Old Warp\\" and is shown on the 1734 Customs Map of the Humber where Read's Island now lays, and extending further downstream. A local history website about Barton-Upon-Humber indicates that both are true. It says that two wrecks, including one which locals deliberately scuttled, helped to form the island off South Ferriby. The scuttling was to protect the banks on the southern shore. In 1872, it was described as being 300 acres, in 1886 it was 491 acres whilst in 2008 it was 200 acres. Flooding in 2007 left the island depleted of areas for Avocets to breed, so a programme of rebuilding was instituted.  History  The Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales suggests that Read's Island was 'formed of Pudding-Pie sand' and that it 'took its name from Mr Read of Burton Stather'. Grass was then seen growing on Old Warp by the end of the 18th century and cattle were put onto the island to graze. With the Humber Estuary being a drain for a large part of the Midlands, including the River Trent and all of its tributaries, and the River Ouse draining a major part of Yorkshire, England, and being very tidal, it was a simple task and a matter of waiting a few years for some strategically placed piles of bricks and concrete (Warping) to start off this island by allow the rich silt to build up. It was certainly protected and further land reclaimed from the Humber as its island status grew, and by the 1861 census there was one wooden cottage on the island, with a fresh water well. = Military history = German prisoners of war rebuilt the brick flood walls during the 1914‚Äì1918 war and on the 21 May 1942, an Airspeed Oxford of No 15 PAFU from RAF Kirmington crashed into the east side of the island. On 24 December 1944, a V1 rocket crashed into the mud by Read's Island. It was part of a synchronized attack on Manchester by Heinkel 111 aircraft. The rockets were launched from aircraft to improve their range. = Agriculture and human history = In 1871, the Humber Conservancy agreed to buy the island from the Crown Estate for a sum of ¬£1434.4s.3d(equivalent to ¬£935,000 in 2015)See external links for conversion websites. and the land was rented out to the tenant farmers. The major part of Read's Island is in the parish of Winteringham despite the closest village being South Ferriby. It has been occupied at times in the past, at one point as a farm with cattle roaming along it, and when there are particularly high spring tides, at low water, it was possible for the cattle to reach solid ground by walking across the mud at low tide. In the 1930s cattle had to be transported by barge. The island then extended to some and was used for summer grazing. It was locally famous for wildlife and hares.  Hydrometry  Historically, there is an approximate 20-year cycle whereby the main shipping channel alternates from just north of Read's Island to the South Channel, between the Island and the shoreline in South Ferriby and Winteringham parishes. Read's Island looking north west. Taken from South Ferriby. Currently, as the Humber continues to change, the island is in decline. Current thinking suggests that the main (undredged) shipping channel upstream will vary between the island and the north shore and the island and the Humber's Lincolnshire shore. This has been attributed to the flow of the freshwater coming down the estuary.  Ecology  Read's Island is an RSPB reserve due to its importance for birdlife. Species that migrate or live year-round on the island include ground-nesting avocets (10% of the entire UK population), greylag goose, pink-footed goose, marsh harrier, lapwing, wigeon, curlew, golden plover and fallow deer.  Toponymy confusion  Note that Read's Island is the spelling used by the Ordnance Survey and other maps, whilst some spell it Reads Island, and others even Reed's or Reeds Island. An ABPmer document even spells it as Reed's and Read's in the same paragraph. The Read brothers of Burton upon Stather are believed to be the first to graze cattle on the island.

Known for its history, location, architecture and endowment, Trinity is a traditional high church, with an active parish centered around the Episcopal Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion in missionary, outreach, and fellowship. The current building is the third constructed for Trinity Church, and was designed by Richard Upjohn in the Gothic Revival style. The first Trinity Church building was a single-story rectangular structure facing the Hudson River, which was constructed in 1698 and destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776. The second Trinity Church was built facing Wall Street and was consecrated in 1790. The current church building was erected from 1839 to 1846 and was the tallest building in the United States until 1869, as well as the tallest in New York City until 1890. In 1876‚Äì1877 a reredos and altar were erected in memory of William Backhouse Astor, Sr., to the designs of architect Frederick Clarke Withers. The church building is adjacent to the Trinity Churchyard, one of three used by the church. Besides its building, Trinity manages real estate properties with a combined worth of over $6 billion . Trinity's main building is a National Historic Landmark as well as a New York City designated landmark.  History  In 1696, Governor Benjamin Fletcher approved the purchase of land in Lower Manhattan by the Church of England community for construction of a new church. The parish received its charter from King William III on May 6, 1697. Its land grant specified an annual rent of 60 bushels of wheat. The first rector was William Vesey (for whom nearby Vesey Street is named), a protege of Increase Mather, who served for 49 years until his death in 1746. =First Trinity Church= Loyalist Charles Inglis, Rector of Trinity Church (1765‚Äì1783) The first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a gambrel roof and small porch, was constructed in 1698, on Wall Street, facing the Hudson River. The land on which it was built was formerly a formal garden and then a burial ground. It was built because in 1696, members of the Church of England (Anglicans) protested to obtain a \\"charter granting the church legal status\\" in New York City. According to historical records, Captain William Kidd lent the runner and tackle from his ship for hoisting the stones. Anne, Queen of Great Britain, increased the parish's land holdings to in 1705. Later, in 1709, William Huddleston founded Trinity School as the Charity School of the church, and classes were originally held in the steeple of the church. In 1754, King's College (now Columbia University) was chartered by King George II of Great Britain, and instruction began with eight students in a school building near the church. During the American Revolutionary War the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America, following the departure of General George Washington and the Continental Army shortly after Battle of Long Island and subsequent local defeats. Under British occupation clergy were required to be Loyalists, while the parishioners included some members of the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, as well as the First and Second Continental Congresses. The church was destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776, which started in the Fighting Cocks Tavern, destroying between 400 and 500 buildings and houses, and leaving thousands of New Yorkers homeless. Six days later, most of the city's volunteer firemen followed General Washington north. Rev. Charles Inglis served throughout the war and then to Nova Scotia on evacuation with the whole congregation of Trinity Church.Loyalism in New York during the American revolution, p. 36 The Rev. Samuel Provoost was appointed Rector of Trinity (1784‚Äì1800) in 1784, and the New York State Legislature ratified the charter of Trinity Church, deleting the provision that asserted its loyalty to the King of England. Whig patriots were appointed as vestrymen. In 1787, Provoost was consecrated as the first Bishop of the newly formed Diocese of New York. Following his 1789 inauguration at Federal Hall, George Washington attended Thanksgiving service, presided over by Bishop Provoost, at St. Paul's Chapel, a chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church. He continued to attend services there until the second Trinity Church was finished in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel is currently part of the Parish of Trinity Church and is the oldest public building in continuous use in New York City. =Second Trinity Church= Construction on the second Trinity Church building began in 1788; it was consecrated in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel was used while the second Trinity Church was being built. The second Trinity Church was built facing Wall Street; it was 200 feet tall, and longer and wider than its predecessor. Building a bigger church was beneficial because the population of New York City was expanding. The church was torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838‚Äì39. The second Trinity Church was politically significant because President Washington and members of his government often worshiped there. Additional notable parishioners included John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. Trinity Church c. 1900 =Third Trinity Church= The third and current Trinity Church began construction in 1839 and was finished in 1846. When the Episcopal Bishop of New York consecrated Trinity Church on Ascension Day (May 1) 1846, its soaring Gothic Revival spire, surmounted by a gilded cross, dominated the skyline of lower Manhattan. Trinity was a welcoming beacon for ships sailing into New York Harbor. In 1843, Trinity Church's expanding parish was divided due to the burgeoning cityscape and to better serve the needs of its parishioners. The newly formed parish would build Grace Church, to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build Trinity Church, the structure that stands today. Both Grace and Trinity Churches were completed and consecrated in 1846. Trinity Church held the title of tallest building in the United States until 1869, when it was surpassed by St. Michael's Church, Old Town, Chicago. Trinity continued to be the tallest in New York City, with its spire and cross, until it was surpassed in 1890 by the New York World Building. In 1876‚Äì1877 a reredos and altar were erected in memory of William Backhouse Astor, Sr., to the designs of architect Frederick Clarke Withers. =Late 20th and early 21st centuries= On July 9, 1976, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Trinity Church. Vestrymen presented the Queen with a symbolic \\"back rent\\" of 279 peppercorns. Since 1993, Trinity Church has hosted the graduation ceremonies of the High School of Economics and Finance. The school is located on Trinity Place, a few blocks away from the church. Guided tours of the church are offered daily at 2p.m. In 2015 Mark Francisco Bozzuti-Jones, a priest at Trinity Church, commissioned Mark Dukes to create the icon Our Lady of Ferguson.https://sojo.net/articles/new-icon-depicts-black-mary-our-lady- mother-ferguson September 11, 2001 During the September 11 attacks, people took refuge inside the church from the massive debris cloud produced by the first World Trade Center tower collapse. Some of the chapel pew's paint was rubbed off from the people taking refuge. The pews were later replaced, but one still exists at the back of the chapel for remembrance of the events on 9/11. Falling wreckage knocked over a giant sycamore tree that had stood for nearly a century in the churchyard of St. Paul's Chapel, part of Trinity Church's parish, located several blocks north of Trinity Church. Sculptor Steve Tobin used its roots as the base for a bronze sculpture titled Trinity Root, which stood in front of the church at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway until December 2015, when it was moved by the church to its conference center in Connecticut. The move was controversial as it damaged the sculpture, which was later repaired, and the artist objected to its relocation. Occupy Wall Street Trinity is located near Zuccotti Park, the location of the Occupy Wall Street protests. It offered both moral and practical support to the demonstrators but balked when protesters demanded an encampment on church-owned land called LentSpace, adjoining Juan Pablo Duarte Square in the neighborhood of Hudson Square. The church hierarchy were criticized by others within the Anglican movement, most notably Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On December 17, 2011, occupiers and a few clergy attempted to occupy LentSpace, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. After demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least three Episcopal clergymen and a Roman Catholic nun.

Architecture  Architectural historians consider the third and present Trinity Church building, built in 1846 and designed by architect Richard Upjohn, the first and finest example of Gothic Revival architecture. In 1976, the United States Department of the Interior designated Trinity Church a National Historic Landmark because of its architectural significance and its place within the history of New York City. = Bells = The tower of Trinity Church currently contains 23 bells, the heaviest of which weighs 27 U.S. hundredweight (). Eight of these bells were cast for the tower of the second church building and were hung for ringing in the English change ringing style. Three more bells were added later. In 1946 these bells were adapted for swing chiming and sounded by electric motors. A project to install a new ring of 12 additional change ringing bells was initially proposed in 2001 but put on hold in the aftermath of the September attacks, which took place three blocks north of the church. This project came to fruition in 2006, thanks to funding from the Dill Faulkes Educational Trust. These new bells form the first ring of 12 change-ringing bells ever installed in a church in the United States. The installation work was carried out by Taylors, Eayre and Smith of Loughborough, England, in September 2006. alt= In late 2006, the ringing of the bells for bell practice and tuning caused much concern to local residents, some of whose windows and residences are less than at eye level from the bell tower. The church then built a plywood deck right over the bells and placed shutters on the inside of the bell chamber's lancet windows. With the shutters and the plywood deck closed, the sound of the bells outside the tower is minimal. The shutters, and hatches in the plywood deck, are opened for public ringing. Public ringing takes place before and after 11:15 a.m. Sunday service and on special occasions, such as 9/11 commemorations, weddings, and ticker-tape parades. Details of the individual bells can be found at Dove's Guide for Church Bellringers. = Doors = Trinity Church has three sets of impressive bronze doors, donated by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor in memory of his father, John Jacob Astor III. Conceived by Richard Morris Hunt, they date from 1893 and were produced by Karl Bitter (east door), J. Massey Rhind (south door), and Charles Henry Niehaus (north door). The north and east doors each consists of six panels from Church history or the Bible, and the south door depicts the history of New York in its six panels.Craven, Wayne, Sculpture in America, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York 1968, p. 454  Services  Trinity Church, as an Episcopal parish in the Anglican Communion, offers a full schedule of Daily Prayer and Eucharist services throughout the week, and based on the Book of Common Prayer; it is also available for special occasions, such as weddings and baptisms. In addition to daily worship, Trinity Church provides Christian fellowship and outreach to the community.

Concerts at One has been providing live professional classical and contemporary music for the Wall Street community since 1969, and the church has several organized choirs, featured Sunday mornings on WQXR 105.9 FM in New York City. Trinity presents world-class music programs both in New York City and around the world via high definition video streaming. The mainstay of Trinity's music program is The Choir of Trinity Wall Street, a professional ensemble that leads liturgical music at Trinity Church and St. Paul's Chapel, presents new-music concerts in New York City, produces recordings, and performs in international tours. The Choir is often joined by the Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Trinity's ensemble of period instrumentalists, and NOVUS NY, Trinity's contemporary music orchestra. Trinity is also home to a Youth Chorus, Youth Orchestra, Family Choir, Downtown Voices, change bell ringers, and a wide variety of arts programming through Congregational Arts. Visiting choirs from around the world perform at Trinity weekly. The entire music program is under the leadership of Julian Wachner, Director of Music and the Arts, a renowned conductor, composer, and keyboard artist.  Property holdings  Close-up of statues of Trinity Church Beginning in the 1780s, the church's claim on 62 acres of Queen Anne's 1705 grant was contested in the courts by descendants of a 17th-century Dutchwoman, Anneke Jans Bogardus, who, it was claimed, held original title to that property. The basis of the lawsuits was that only five of Bogardus' six heirs had conveyed the land to the English crown in 1671. Numerous times over the course of six decades, the claimants asserted themselves in court, losing each time. The attempt was even revived in the 20th century. In 1959, the Internal Revenue Service sued over the compensation of the church's property manager, but the church prevailed in Stanton v. United States. Disclosure resulting from a lawsuit filed by a parishioner revealed total assets of about $2 billion as of 2011. Although Trinity Church has sold off much of the land that was part of the royal grant from Queen Anne,, pp. 22‚Äì23 it is still one of the largest landowners in New York City with 14 acres of Manhattan real estate including of commercial space in Hudson Square. The parish's annual revenue from its real estate holdings was $158 million in 2011 with net income of $38 million, making it perhaps one of the richest individual parishes in the world. , Trinity's investment portfolio was worth over $6 billion, At the end of 2018, the church's total equity was $8.9 billion, including $8.3 billion in assets and $0.6 million in liabilities. The institution also owns the Trinity Court Building property, where it formerly housed its offices and preschool. That building was demolished in 2015, and a replacement is under construction. The church was connected to the previous building by a footbridge, which was preserved during demolition, and will be connected to the new building upon its completion.

The Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service arm on 28 March 1923 by King Victor Emmanuel III as the Regia Aeronautica (\\"Royal Air Force\\"). After World War II, when Italy was made a republic by referendum, the Regia Aeronautica was given its current name. Since its formation, the service has held a prominent role in modern Italian military history. The aerobatic display team is the Frecce Tricolori. History =Early history and World War I= Italy was among the earliest adopters of military aviation. Its air arm dates back to 1884, when the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was authorised to acquire its own air component. The Air Service (Corpo Aeronautico Militare) operated balloons based near Rome. Palazzo dell'Aeronautica, headquarters of the Italian Air Force In 1911, reconnaissance and bombing sorties during the Italo-Turkish War by the Servizio Aeronautico represented the first use of heavier-than-air aircraft in armed conflict. =The Regia Aeronautica and World War II= On 28 March 1923, the Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service by King Vittorio Emanuele III of the Kingdom of Italy. This air force was known as the Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force). During the 1930s, the fledgling Regia Aeronautica was involved in its first military operations, first in Ethiopia in 1935, and later in the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939. After a period of neutrality, Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940 alongside Germany. The Regia Aeronautica could deploy more than 3,000 aircraft, although fewer than 60% were serviceable. It fought from the icy steppes of Russia to the sands of the North African desert, losing men and machines. After the armistice of 8 September 1943, Italy was divided into two sides, and the same fate befell the Regia Aeronautica. The Air Force was split into the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force in the south aligned with the Allies, and the pro-Axis Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana in the north until the end of the war. On 8 May 1945, the hostilities ended, beginning the rebirth of military aviation in Italy. =The birth of Aeronautica Militare and the Cold War= Italian North American P-51D Mustang exhibited at the museum of Vigna di Valle A popular vote by the people resulted in the end of the Kingdom of Italy and the establishment of the Italian Republic on 18 June 1946. Hence the Regia Aeronautica lost its \\"Royal\\" designation, and it became the Aeronautica Militare, a name that it has continued to hold ever since. The Peace Treaty of Paris of 1947 placed severe restrictions on all of the Italian armed forces, but the establishment of NATO in 1949 with Italy as a founding member brought about the necessity for the modernization of all of the Italian armed forces, including the Italian Air Force. American military aid sent by the Mutual Defense Assistance Program brought about the introduction of American-made P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang propeller-driven fighter planes. In 1952, the Italian Air Force was granted jet fighters for the first time, American F-84G Thunderjets and F-86D Sabres, together with over 200 licence-built British de Havilland Vampires; these were followed by F-84F fighters and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes from the United States. The reborn Italian aviation industry also began to develop and produce a few ingenious aircraft designs of its own, such as the Fiat G91, the Aermacchi MB-326, the Piaggio Aero P.166 and the line of Agusta-Bell helicopters. The first supersonic fighters added to the Italian Air Force were American- designed F-104 Starfighters that were produced by a group of several European aircraft companies, including Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm, Dornier, Fiat, Fokker and SABCA. During the 1970s, the Air Force acquired the Italian Aeritalia G222 and the modern American C-130 Hercules tactical transport planes, capable of carrying cargo or paratroopers. It also received the new Lockheed-Aeritalia F-104S Starfighter fighters for ground attack and air- defence purposes. Italian Eurofighter Typhoon Hercules C-130J-30 departing the 2014 Royal International Air Tattoo, England A push to expand the Italian aircraft industry led Italy into the huge trilateral project that developed the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber and air-defence fighters along with West Germany and the United Kingdom. Tornado fighters were still in service with all three countries, plus a few more, as of 2019. Italian companies worked with the Embraer Company of Brazil in a smaller project to develop and produce the AMX International AMX aircraft. =From the end of the Cold War to present day = In 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Italy joined the coalition forces, and for the first time in 45 years Italian pilots and aircraft were assigned to combat operations. Needing to replace the obsolete F-104 Starfighters, Italy joined with Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon, which was expected to enter the Italian Air Force in 2000. In 1994, with the Typhoon still some years from introduction to service, 24 Panavia Tornado Air Defense Variant (ADV) interceptors were leased from the United Kingdom for a period of 10 years. The ADV Tornados served as fighter-interceptors to supplement and then to replace the old F-104 Starfighters. However, delays in the production of the Typhoon forced the Italians to seek a supplement, and then replacement, for the leased Tornado ADVs. With the UK lease due to expire in 2004, the Italian government wished to avoid a costly lease extension and instead opted to lease 34 F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-role fighter planes on multi-year leases from the US. The last of these fighters was returned to the United States in May 2012, following the Italian Air Force's acquisition of a sufficient number of Typhoons over a period of several years. The Typhoons are intended to replace all of the F-104, Tornado ADV and F-16 aircraft. The last of the Italian F-104s was withdrawn from service in 2004. Armed conflicts in Somalia, Mozambique and the nearby Balkan Peninsula led to the Italian Air Force becoming a participant in multinational air forces, such as that of NATO over the former Yugoslavia, just a few minutes flying time east of the Italian peninsula. The commanders of the Italian Air Force soon saw the need to improve the Italian air defences. The capability of the Italian Air Force as a transportation unit has been improved with the acquisition of 22 American C-130J tactical transports and 12 Alenia C-27J Spartans, which have replaced all of the G222s. In 2003, the Italian Air Force extended its capabilities to small-scale land warfare by small special-forces units. This was accomplished by forming the 17¬∫ Stormo Incursori (\\"17th Special Operations Wing\\"), also known as RIAM (Reparto Incursori Aeronautica Militare, \\"Air Force Raiders Group\\"), a unit that is primarily responsible for raids on land-based aeronautical compounds, forward air control missions and combat search and rescue operations.Italy opens F-35 assembly line, as political opposition grows .

There are many equivalent ways to define a matroid axiomatically, the most significant being in terms of: independent sets; bases or circuits; rank functions; closure operators; and closed sets or flats. In the language of partially ordered sets, a finite matroid is equivalent to a geometric lattice. Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is the abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields. Matroids have found applications in geometry, topology, combinatorial optimization, network theory and coding theory. Definition There are many equivalent (cryptomorphic) ways to define a (finite) matroid.A standard source for basic definitions and results about matroids is Oxley (1992). An older standard source is Welsh (1976). See Brylawski's appendix in White (1986), pp. 298‚Äì302, for a list of equivalent axiom systems. =Independent sets= In terms of independence, a finite matroid M is a pair (E,\\\\mathcal{I}), where E is a finite set (called the ground set) and \\\\mathcal{I} is a family of subsets of E (called the independent sets) with the following properties:, Section 1.2, \\"Axiom Systems for a Matroid\\", pp. 7‚Äì9. # The empty set is independent, i.e., \\\\emptyset\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. Alternatively, at least one subset of E is independent, i.e., \\\\mathcal{I} eq\\\\emptyset. # Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e., for each A'\\\\subseteq A\\\\subseteq E, if A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I} then A'\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. This is sometimes called the hereditary property. # If A and B are two independent sets (i.e., each set is independent) and A has more elements than B, then there exists x\\\\in A \\\\backslash B such that B \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} is in \\\\mathcal{I}. This is sometimes called the augmentation property or the independent set exchange property. The first two properties define a combinatorial structure known as an independence system (or abstract simplicial complex). =Bases and circuits= A subset of the ground set E that is not independent is called dependent. A maximal independent set‚Äîthat is, an independent set that becomes dependent on adding any element of E‚Äîis called a basis for the matroid. A circuit in a matroid M is a minimal dependent subset of E‚Äîthat is, a dependent set whose proper subsets are all independent. The terminology arises because the circuits of graphic matroids are cycles in the corresponding graphs. The dependent sets, the bases, or the circuits of a matroid characterize the matroid completely: a set is independent if and only if it is not dependent, if and only if it is a subset of a basis, and if and only if it does not contain a circuit. The collections of dependent sets, of bases, and of circuits each have simple properties that may be taken as axioms for a matroid. For instance, one may define a matroid M to be a pair (E,\\\\mathcal{B}), where E is a finite set as before and \\\\mathcal{B} is a collection of subsets of E, called \\"bases\\", with the following properties: # \\\\mathcal{B} is nonempty. # If A and B are distinct members of \\\\mathcal{B} and a\\\\in A\\\\setminus B, then there exists an element b\\\\in B\\\\setminus A such that (A \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\\\\\}) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}. This property is called the basis exchange property. It follows from the basis exchange property that no member of \\\\mathcal{B} can be a proper subset of another. =Rank functions= It is a basic result of matroid theory, directly analogous to a similar theorem of bases in linear algebra, that any two bases of a matroid M have the same number of elements. This number is called the rank of M. If M is a matroid on E, and A is a subset of E, then a matroid on A can be defined by considering a subset of A to be independent if and only if it is independent in M. This allows us to talk about submatroids and about the rank of any subset of E. The rank of a subset A is given by the rank function r(A) of the matroid, which has the following properties: *The value of the rank function is always a non-negative integer. *For any subset A\\\\subset E, we have r(A) \\\\le A. *For any two subsets A, B\\\\subset E, we have: r(A\\\\cup B)+r(A\\\\cap B)\\\\le r(A)+r(B). That is, the rank is a submodular function. *For any set A and element x, we have: r(A)\\\\le r(A\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})\\\\le r(A)+1. From the first inequality it follows more generally that, if A\\\\subseteq B\\\\subseteq E, then r(A)\\\\leq r(B)\\\\leq r(E). That is, rank is a monotonic function. These properties can be used as one of the alternative definitions of a finite matroid: if (E,r) satisfies these properties, then the independent sets of a matroid over E can be defined as those subsets A of E with r(A)=A. In the language of partially ordered sets, such a matroid structure is equivalent to the geometric lattice whose elements are the subsets A\\\\subset M, partially ordered by inclusion. The difference A-r(A) is called the nullity of the subset A. It is the minimum number of elements that must be removed from A to obtain an independent set. The nullity of E in M is called the nullity of M. The difference r(E)-r(A) is sometimes called the corank of the subset A. =Closure operators= Let M be a matroid on a finite set E, with rank function r as above. The closure (or span) \\\\operatorname{cl}(A) of a subset A of E is the set :\\\\operatorname{cl}(A) = \\\\Bigl\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in E\\\\mid r(A)=r\\\\bigl(A\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}\\\\bigr)\\\\Bigr\\\\\\\\}. This defines a closure operator \\\\operatorname{cl}: \\\\mathcal{P}(E)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}(E) where \\\\mathcal{P} denotes the power set, with the following properties: * For all subsets X of E, X\\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{cl}(X). * For all subsets X of E, \\\\operatorname{cl}(X)= \\\\operatorname{cl}(\\\\operatorname{cl}(X)). * For all subsets X and Y of E with X\\\\subseteq Y, \\\\operatorname{cl}(X)\\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{cl}(Y). * For all elements a, and b of E and all subsets Y of E, if a\\\\in\\\\operatorname{cl}(Y\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\}) \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{cl}(Y) then b\\\\in\\\\operatorname{cl}(Y\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\}) \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{cl}(Y). The first three of these properties are the defining properties of a closure operator. The fourth is sometimes called the Mac Lane‚ÄìSteinitz exchange property. These properties may be taken as another definition of matroid: every function \\\\operatorname{cl}: \\\\mathcal{P}(E)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}(E) that obeys these properties determines a matroid. =Flats= A set whose closure equals itself is said to be closed, or a flat or subspace of the matroid., Section 1.8, \\"Closed sets = Flats = Subspaces\\", pp. 21‚Äì22. A set is closed if it is maximal for its rank, meaning that the addition of any other element to the set would increase the rank. The closed sets of a matroid are characterized by a covering partition property: * The whole point set E is closed. * If S and T are flats, then S\\\\cap T is a flat. * If S is a flat, then each element of E\\\\setminus S is in precisely one of the flats T that cover S (meaning that T properly contains S but there is no flat U between S and T). The class \\\\mathcal{L}(M) of all flats, partially ordered by set inclusion, forms a matroid lattice. Conversely, every matroid lattice L forms a matroid over its set E of atoms under the following closure operator: for a set S of atoms with join \\\\bigvee S, :\\\\operatorname{cl}(S) = \\\\\\\\{ x\\\\in E\\\\mid x\\\\le\\\\bigvee S \\\\\\\\}. The flats of this matroid correspond one-for-one with the elements of the lattice; the flat corresponding to lattice element y is the set :\\\\\\\\{ x\\\\in E\\\\mid x\\\\le y\\\\\\\\}. Thus, the lattice of flats of this matroid is naturally isomorphic to L. =Hyperplanes= In a matroid of rank r, a flat of rank r-1 is called a hyperplane. (Hyperplanes are also called coatoms or copoints.) These are the maximal proper flats; that is, the only superset of a hyperplane that is also a flat is the set E of all the elements of the matroid. An equivalent definition is that a coatom is a subset of E that does not span M, but such that adding any other element to it does make a spanning set., Section 2.2, \\"The Hyperplanes of a Matroid\\", pp. 38‚Äì39. The family \\\\mathcal{H} of hyperplanes of a matroid has the following properties, which may be taken as yet another axiomatization of matroids: *There do not exist distinct sets X and Y in \\\\mathcal{H} with X\\\\subseteq Y. That is, the hyperplanes form a Sperner family. *For every x\\\\in E and distinct Y,Z\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H} with x otin Y\\\\cup Z, there exists X\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H} with (Y\\\\cap Z)\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq X. =Graphoids= Minty (1966) defined a graphoid as a triple (L, C, D) in which C and D are classes of nonempty subsets of L such that *no element of C (called a \\"circuit\\") contains another, *no element of D (called a \\"cocircuit\\") contains another, *no set in C and set in D intersect in exactly one element, and *whenever L is represented as the disjoint union of subsets R, G, B with G=\\\\\\\\{g\\\\\\\\} (a singleton set), then either an X \\\\in C exists such that g \\\\in X \\\\subseteq R \\\\cup G or a Y \\\\in D exists such that g \\\\in Y \\\\subseteq B \\\\cup G. He proved that there is a matroid for which C is the class of circuits and D is the class of cocircuits. Conversely, if C and D are the circuit and cocircuit classes of a matroid M with ground set E, then (E, C, D) is a graphoid. Thus, graphoids give a self-dual cryptomorphic axiomatization of matroids.  Examples  =Uniform matroids= Let E be a finite set and k a natural number. One may define a matroid on E by taking every k-element subset of E to be a basis. This is known as the uniform matroid of rank k. A uniform matroid with rank k and with n elements is denoted U_{k,n}. All uniform matroids of rank at least 2 are simple (see ) . The uniform matroid of rank 2 on n points is called the n-point line. A matroid is uniform if and only if it has no circuits of size less than one plus the rank of the matroid. The direct sums of uniform matroids are called partition matroids. In the uniform matroid U_{0,n}, every element is a loop (an element that does not belong to any independent set), and in the uniform matroid U_{n,n}, every element is a coloop (an element that belongs to all bases). The direct sum of matroids of these two types is a partition matroid in which every element is a loop or a coloop; it is called a discrete matroid. An equivalent definition of a discrete matroid is a matroid in which every proper, non-empty subset of the ground set E is a separator. =Matroids from linear algebra= The Fano matroid, derived from the Fano plane. It is GF(2)-linear but not real-linear. The V√°mos matroid, not linear over any field Matroid theory developed mainly out of a deep examination of the properties of independence and dimension in vector spaces. There are two ways to present the matroids defined in this way: * If E is any finite subset of a vector space V, then we can define a matroid M on E by taking the independent sets of M to be the linearly independent subsets of E. The validity of the independent-set axioms for this matroid follows from the Steinitz exchange lemma. If M is a matroid that can be defined in this way, we say the set E represents M. Matroids of this kind are called vector matroids. An important example of a matroid defined in this way is the Fano matroid, a rank-three matroid derived from the Fano plane, a finite geometry with seven points (the seven elements of the matroid) and seven lines (the proper nontrivial flats of the matroid). It is a linear matroid whose elements may be described as the seven nonzero points in a three-dimensional vector space over the finite field GF(2). However, it is not possible to provide a similar representation for the Fano matroid using the real numbers in place of GF(2). * A matrix A with entries in a field gives rise to a matroid M on its set of columns. The dependent sets of columns in the matroid are those that are linearly dependent as vectors. This matroid is called the column matroid of A, and A is said to represent M. For instance, the Fano matroid can be represented in this way as a 3 √ó 7 (0,1)-matrix. Column matroids are just vector matroids under another name, but there are often reasons to favor the matrix representation. (There is one technical difference: a column matroid can have distinct elements that are the same vector, but a vector matroid as defined above cannot. Usually this difference is insignificant and can be ignored, but by letting E be a multiset of vectors one brings the two definitions into complete agreement.) A matroid that is equivalent to a vector matroid, although it may be presented differently, is called representable or linear. If M is equivalent to a vector matroid over a field F, then we say M is representable over in particular, M is real- representable if it is representable over the real numbers. For instance, although a graphic matroid (see below) is presented in terms of a graph, it is also representable by vectors over any field. A basic problem in matroid theory is to characterize the matroids that may be represented over a given field F; Rota's conjecture describes a possible characterization for every finite field. The main results so far are characterizations of binary matroids (those representable over GF(2)) due to Tutte (1950s), of ternary matroids (representable over the 3-element field) due to Reid and Bixby, and separately to Seymour (1970s), and of quaternary matroids (representable over the 4-element field) due to Geelen, Gerards, and Kapoor (2000). This is very much an open area. A regular matroid is a matroid that is representable over all possible fields. The V√°mos matroid is the simplest example of a matroid that is not representable over any field. =Matroids from graph theory= A second original source for the theory of matroids is graph theory. Every finite graph (or multigraph) G gives rise to a matroid M(G) as follows: take as E the set of all edges in G and consider a set of edges independent if and only if it is a forest; that is, if it does not contain a simple cycle. Then M(G) is called a cycle matroid. Matroids derived in this way are graphic matroids. Not every matroid is graphic, but all matroids on three elements are graphic. Every graphic matroid is regular. Other matroids on graphs were discovered subsequently: *The bicircular matroid of a graph is defined by calling a set of edges independent if every connected subset contains at most one cycle. *In any directed or undirected graph G let E and F be two distinguished sets of vertices. In the set E, define a subset U to be independent if there are U vertex-disjoint paths from F onto U. This defines a matroid on E called a gammoid: a strict gammoid is one for which the set E is the whole vertex set of G. *In a bipartite graph G = (U,V,E), one may form a matroid in which the elements are vertices on one side U of the bipartition, and the independent subsets are sets of endpoints of matchings of the graph. This is called a transversal matroid, and it is a special case of a gammoid. The transversal matroids are the dual matroids to the strict gammoids. *Graphic matroids have been generalized to matroids from signed graphs, gain graphs, and biased graphs. A graph G with a distinguished linear class B of cycles, known as a \\"biased graph\\" (G, B), has two matroids, known as the frame matroid and the lift matroid of the biased graph. If every cycle belongs to the distinguished class, these matroids coincide with the cycle matroid of G. If no cycle is distinguished, the frame matroid is the bicircular matroid of G. A signed graph, whose edges are labeled by signs, and a gain graph, which is a graph whose edges are labeled orientably from a group, each give rise to a biased graph and therefore have frame and lift matroids. *The Laman graphs form the bases of the two-dimensional rigidity matroid, a matroid defined in the theory of structural rigidity. *Let G be a connected graph and E be its edge set. Let I be the collection of subsets F of E such that G - F is still connected. Then M^*(G), whose element set is E and with I as its class of independent sets, is a matroid called the bond matroid of G. The rank function r(F) is the cyclomatic number of the subgraph induced on the edge subset F, which equals the number of edges outside a maximal forest of that subgraph, and also the number of independent cycles in it. =Matroids from field extensions= A third original source of matroid theory is field theory. An extension of a field gives rise to a matroid. Suppose F and K are fields with K containing F. Let E be any finite subset of K. Define a subset S of E to be algebraically independent if the extension field F(S) has transcendence degree equal to S. A matroid that is equivalent to a matroid of this kind is called an algebraic matroid. The problem of characterizing algebraic matroids is extremely difficult; little is known about it. The V√°mos matroid provides an example of a matroid that is not algebraic.  Basic constructions  There are some standard ways to make new matroids out of old ones. =Duality= If M is a finite matroid, we can define the orthogonal or dual matroid M* by taking the same underlying set and calling a set a basis in M* if and only if its complement is a basis in M. It is not difficult to verify that M* is a matroid and that the dual of M* is M. The dual can be described equally well in terms of other ways to define a matroid. For instance: * A set is independent in M* if and only if its complement spans M. * A set is a circuit of M* if and only if its complement is a coatom in M. * The rank function of the dual is r^*(S) = S- r(M) + r\\\\left(E\\\\setminus S\\\\right). According to a matroid version of Kuratowski's theorem, the dual of a graphic matroid M is a graphic matroid if and only if M is the matroid of a planar graph. In this case, the dual of M is the matroid of the dual graph of G. The dual of a vector matroid representable over a particular field F is also representable over F. The dual of a transversal matroid is a strict gammoid and vice versa. Example The cycle matroid of a graph is the dual matroid of its bond matroid. =Minors= If M is a matroid with element set E, and S is a subset of E, the restriction of M to S, written M S, is the matroid on the set S whose independent sets are the independent sets of M that are contained in S. Its circuits are the circuits of M that are contained in S and its rank function is that of M restricted to subsets of S. In linear algebra, this corresponds to restricting to the subspace generated by the vectors in S. Equivalently if T = M‚àíS this may be termed the deletion of T, written M\\\\T or M‚àíT. The submatroids of M are precisely the results of a sequence of deletions: the order is irrelevant. The dual operation of restriction is contraction. If T is a subset of E, the contraction of M by T, written M/T, is the matroid on the underlying set E ‚àí T whose rank function is r'(A) = r(A \\\\cup T) - r(T). In linear algebra, this corresponds to looking at the quotient space by the linear space generated by the vectors in T, together with the images of the vectors in E - T. A matroid N that is obtained from M by a sequence of restriction and contraction operations is called a minor of M. We say M contains N as a minor. Many important families of matroids may be characterized by the minor-minimal matroids that do not belong to the family; these are called forbidden or excluded minors. =Sums and unions= Let M be a matroid with an underlying set of elements E, and let N be another matroid on an underlying set F. The direct sum of matroids M and N is the matroid whose underlying set is the disjoint union of E and F, and whose independent sets are the disjoint unions of an independent set of M with an independent set of N. The union of M and N is the matroid whose underlying set is the union (not the disjoint union) of E and F, and whose independent sets are those subsets that are the union of an independent set in M and one in N. Usually the term \\"union\\" is applied when E = F, but that assumption is not essential. If E and F are disjoint, the union is the direct sum.  Additional terminology  Let M be a matroid with an underlying set of elements E. * E may be called the ground set of M. Its elements may be called the points of M. * A subset of E spans M if its closure is E. A set is said to span a closed set K if its closure is K. * The girth of a matroid is the size of its smallest circuit or dependent set. * An element that forms a single-element circuit of M is called a loop. Equivalently, an element is a loop if it belongs to no basis. * An element that belongs to no circuit is called a coloop or isthmus. Equivalently, an element is a coloop if it belongs to every basis. Loop and coloops are mutually dual. * If a two- element set {f, g} is a circuit of M, then f and g are parallel in M. * A matroid is called simple if it has no circuits consisting of 1 or 2 elements. That is, it has no loops and no parallel elements. The term combinatorial geometry is also used. A simple matroid obtained from another matroid M by deleting all loops and deleting one element from each 2-element circuit until no 2-element circuits remain is called a simplification of M. A matroid is co- simple if its dual matroid is simple. * A union of circuits is sometimes called a cycle of M. A cycle is therefore the complement of a flat of the dual matroid. (This usage conflicts with the common meaning of \\"cycle\\" in graph theory.) * A separator of M is a subset S of E such that r(S) + r(E-S) = r(M). A proper or non-trivial separator is a separator that is neither E nor the empty set. An irreducible separator is a separator that contains no other non- empty separator. The irreducible separators partition the ground set E. * A matroid that cannot be written as the direct sum of two nonempty matroids, or equivalently that has no proper separators, is called connected or irreducible. A matroid is connected if and only if its dual is connected. * A maximal irreducible submatroid of M is called a component of M. A component is the restriction of M to an irreducible separator, and contrariwise, the restriction of M to an irreducible separator is a component. A separator is a union of components. * A matroid M is called a frame matroid if it, or a matroid that contains it, has a basis such that all the points of M are contained in the lines that join pairs of basis elements. * A matroid is called a paving matroid if all of its circuits have size at least equal to its rank. * The matroid polytope P_M is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the bases of M. Algorithms =Greedy algorithm= A weighted matroid is a matroid together with a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be the sum of the weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum- weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need to know anything about the details of the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent. This optimization algorithm may be used to characterize matroids: if a family F of sets, closed under taking subsets, has the property that, no matter how the sets are weighted, the greedy algorithm finds a maximum-weight set in the family, then F must be the family of independent sets of a matroid. The notion of matroid has been generalized to allow for other types of sets on which a greedy algorithm gives optimal solutions; see greedoid and matroid embedding for more information. =Matroid partitioning= The matroid partitioning problem is to partition the elements of a matroid into as few independent sets as possible, and the matroid packing problem is to find as many disjoint spanning sets as possible. Both can be solved in polynomial time, and can be generalized to the problem of computing the rank or finding an independent set in a matroid sum. =Matroid intersection= The intersection of two or more matroids is the family of sets that are simultaneously independent in each of the matroids. The problem of finding the largest set, or the maximum weighted set, in the intersection of two matroids can be found in polynomial time, and provides a solution to many other important combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, maximum matching in bipartite graphs can be expressed as a problem of intersecting two partition matroids. However, finding the largest set in an intersection of three or more matroids is NP-complete. =Matroid software= Two standalone systems for calculations with matroids are Kingan's Oid and Hlineny's Macek. Both of them are open sourced packages. \\"Oid\\" is an interactive, extensible software system for experimenting with matroids. \\"Macek\\" is a specialized software system with tools and routines for reasonably efficient combinatorial computations with representable matroids. Both open source mathematics software systems SAGE and Macaulay2 contain matroid packages. Polynomial invariants There are two especially significant polynomials associated to a finite matroid M on the ground set E. Each is a matroid invariant, which means that isomorphic matroids have the same polynomial. =Characteristic polynomial= The characteristic polynomial of M (which is sometimes called the chromatic polynomial, although it does not count colorings), is defined to be :p_M(\\\\lambda) := \\\\sum_{S \\\\subseteq E} (-1)^{S}\\\\lambda^{r(M)-r(S)}, or equivalently (as long as the empty set is closed in M) as :p_M(\\\\lambda) := \\\\sum_{A} \\\\mu(\\\\emptyset,A) \\\\lambda^{r(M)-r(A)} \\\\ , where Œº denotes the M√∂bius function of the geometric lattice of the matroid and the sum is taken over all the flats A of the matroid. When M is the cycle matroid M(G) of a graph G, the characteristic polynomial is a slight transformation of the chromatic polynomial, which is given by œáG (Œª) = ŒªcpM(G) (Œª), where c is the number of connected components of G. When M is the bond matroid M*(G) of a graph G, the characteristic polynomial equals the flow polynomial of G. When M is the matroid M(A) of an arrangement A of linear hyperplanes in Rn (or Fn where F is any field), the characteristic polynomial of the arrangement is given by pA (Œª) = Œªn‚àír(M)pM(A) (Œª). Beta invariant The beta invariant of a matroid, introduced by Crapo (1967), may be expressed in terms of the characteristic polynomial p as an evaluation of the derivative : \\\\beta(M) = (-1)^{r(M)-1} p_M'(1) \\\\ or directly as : \\\\beta(M) = (-1)^{r(M)} \\\\sum_{X \\\\subseteq E} (-1)^{X} r(X) \\\\ . The beta invariant is non-negative, and is zero if and only if M is disconnected, or empty, or a loop. Otherwise it depends only on the lattice of flats of M. If M has no loops and coloops then Œ≤(M) = Œ≤(M‚àó). =Tutte polynomial= The Tutte polynomial of a matroid, TM (x,y), generalizes the characteristic polynomial to two variables. This gives it more combinatorial interpretations, and also gives it the duality property :T_{M^*}(x,y) = T_M(y,x), which implies a number of dualities between properties of M and properties of M *. One definition of the Tutte polynomial is :T_M(x,y) = \\\\sum_{S \\\\subseteq E} (x-1)^{r(M)-r(S)}(y-1)^{S-r(S)}. This expresses the Tutte polynomial as an evaluation of the corank-nullity or rank generating polynomial, :R_M(u,v) = \\\\sum_{S\\\\subseteq E} u^{r(M)-r(S)}v^{S-r(S)}. From this definition it is easy to see that the characteristic polynomial is, up to a simple factor, an evaluation of TM, specifically, :p_M(\\\\lambda) = (-1)^{r(M)} T_M(1-\\\\lambda,0). Another definition is in terms of internal and external activities and a sum over bases, reflecting the fact that T(1,1) is the number of bases. This, which sums over fewer subsets but has more complicated terms, was Tutte's original definition. There is a further definition in terms of recursion by deletion and contraction. The deletion-contraction identity is :F(M) = F(M-e)+F(M/e) when e is neither a loop nor a coloop. An invariant of matroids (i.e., a function that takes the same value on isomorphic matroids) satisfying this recursion and the multiplicative condition :F(M\\\\oplus M') = F(M) F(M') is said to be a Tutte-Grothendieck invariant. The Tutte polynomial is the most general such invariant; that is, the Tutte polynomial is a Tutte-Grothendieck invariant and every such invariant is an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial. The Tutte polynomial TG of a graph is the Tutte polynomial TM(G) of its cycle matroid.  Infinite matroids  The theory of infinite matroids is much more complicated than that of finite matroids and forms a subject of its own. For a long time, one of the difficulties has been that there were many reasonable and useful definitions, none of which appeared to capture all the important aspects of finite matroid theory. For instance, it seemed to be hard to have bases, circuits, and duality together in one notion of infinite matroids. The simplest definition of an infinite matroid is to require finite rank; that is, the rank of E is finite. This theory is similar to that of finite matroids except for the failure of duality due to the fact that the dual of an infinite matroid of finite rank does not have finite rank. Finite-rank matroids include any subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces and of field extensions of finite transcendence degree. The next simplest infinite generalization is finitary matroids. A matroid is finitary if it has the property that :x \\\\in cl(Y) \\\\Leftrightarrow (\\\\exists Y' \\\\subseteq Y) Y' \\\\text{ is finite and } x \\\\in cl(Y'). Equivalently, every dependent set contains a finite dependent set. Examples are linear dependence of arbitrary subsets of infinite-dimensional vector spaces (but not infinite dependencies as in Hilbert and Banach spaces), and algebraic dependence in arbitrary subsets of field extensions of possibly infinite transcendence degree. Again, the class of finitary matroid is not self-dual, because the dual of a finitary matroid is not finitary. Finitary infinite matroids are studied in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic with strong ties to algebra. In the late 1960s matroid theorists asked for a more general notion that shares the different aspects of finite matroids and generalizes their duality. Many notions of infinite matroids were defined in response to this challenge, but the question remained open. One of the approaches examined by D.A. Higgs became known as B-matroids and was studied by Higgs, Oxley and others in the 1960s and 1970s. According to a recent result by , it solves the problem: Arriving at the same notion independently, they provided five equivalent systems of axiom‚Äîin terms of independence, bases, circuits, closure and rank. The duality of B-matroids generalizes dualities that can be observed in infinite graphs. The independence axioms are as follows: # The empty set is independent. # Every subset of an independent set is independent. # For every nonmaximal (under set inclusion) independent set I and maximal independent set J, there is x\\\\in J \\\\setminus I such that I\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} is independent. # For every subset X of the base space, every independent subset I of X can be extended to a maximal independent subset of X. With these axioms, every matroid has a dual. History Matroid theory was introduced by . It was also independently discovered by Takeo Nakasawa, whose work was forgotten for many years . In his seminal paper, Whitney provided two axioms for independence, and defined any structure adhering to these axioms to be \\"matroids\\". (Although it was perhaps implied, he did not include an axiom requiring at least one subset to be independent.) His key observation was that these axioms provide an abstraction of \\"independence\\" that is common to both graphs and matrices. Because of this, many of the terms used in matroid theory resemble the terms for their analogous concepts in linear algebra or graph theory. Almost immediately after Whitney first wrote about matroids, an important article was written by on the relation of matroids to projective geometry. A year later, noted similarities between algebraic and linear dependence in his classic textbook on Modern Algebra. In the 1940s Richard Rado developed further theory under the name \\"independence systems\\" with an eye towards transversal theory, where his name for the subject is still sometimes used. In the 1950s W. T. Tutte became the foremost figure in matroid theory, a position he retained for many years. His contributions were plentiful, including the characterization of binary, regular, and graphic matroids by excluded minors; the regular-matroid representability theorem; the theory of chain groups and their matroids; and the tools he used to prove many of his results, the \\"Path theorem\\" and \\"Tutte homotopy theorem\\" (see, e.g., ), which are so complex that later theorists have gone to great trouble to eliminate the necessity of using them in proofs. (A fine example is A. M. H. Gerards' short proof (1989) of Tutte's characterization of regular matroids.) and generalized to matroids Tutte's \\"dichromate\\", a graphic polynomial now known as the Tutte polynomial (named by Crapo). Their work has recently (especially in the 2000s) been followed by a flood of papers--though not as many as on the Tutte polynomial of a graph. In 1976 Dominic Welsh published the first comprehensive book on matroid theory. Paul Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular matroids (1980) was the most significant and influential work of the late 1970s and the 1980s. Another fundamental contribution, by , showed why projective geometries and Dowling geometries play such an important role in matroid theory. By this time there were many other important contributors, but one should not omit to mention Geoff Whittle's extension to ternary matroids of Tutte's characterization of binary matroids that are representable over the rationals , perhaps the biggest single contribution of the 1990s. In the current period (since around 2000) the Matroid Minors Project of Jim Geelen, Gerards, Whittle, and others, which attempts to duplicate for matroids that are representable over a finite field the success of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minors Project (see Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem), has produced substantial advances in the structure theory of matroids. Many others have also contributed to that part of matroid theory, which (in the first and second decades of the 21st century) is flourishing. Researchers Mathematicians who pioneered the study of matroids include Takeo Nakasawa, Saunders Mac Lane, Richard Rado, W. T. Tutte, B. L. van der Waerden, and Hassler Whitney. Other major contributors include Jack Edmonds, Jim Geelen, Eugene Lawler, L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz, Gian-Carlo Rota, P. D. Seymour, and Dominic Welsh.

Three dimensions Subgroups for Schoenflies groups S2 to S20 In 3D, equivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a point on the axis. Therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion. A three-dimensional symmetry that has only one fixed point is necessarily an improper rotation. In both cases the operations commute. Rotoreflection and rotoinversion are the same if they differ in angle of rotation by 180¬∞, and the point of inversion is in the plane of reflection. An improper rotation of an object thus produces a rotation of its mirror image. The axis is called the rotation-reflection axis.. This is called an n-fold improper rotation if the angle of rotation is 360¬∞/n. There are several different systems for naming individual improper rotations: * The Schoenflies notation uses the symbol Sn (German, ', for mirror) denotes the symmetry group generated by an n-fold improper rotation. For example, the symmetry operation S6 is the combination of a rotation of (360¬∞/6)=60¬∞ and a mirror plane reflection. (This should not to be confused with the same notation for symmetric groups). * In Hermann‚ÄìMauguin notation the symbol is used for n-fold rotoinversion; i.e., rotation by an angle of rotation of 360¬∞/n with inversion. Note that is simply a reflection, and is normally denoted m. * The Coxeter notation for S2n is [2n+,2+]. * The Orbifold notation is n√ó, order 2n. The direct subgroup of S2n, of index 2, is Cn, [n]+, or (nn), of order n, being the rotoreflection generator applied twice. S2n for odd n contains an inversion, denoted Ci. But for even n S2n does not contain inversion. In general, if odd p is a divisor of n, then S2n/p is a subgroup of S2n. For example S4 is a subgroup of S12. As an indirect isometry  In a wider sense, an improper rotation may be defined as any indirect isometry; i.e., an element of E(3)\\\\E+(3): thus it can also be a pure reflection in a plane, or have a glide plane. An indirect isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of ‚àí1. A proper rotation is an ordinary rotation. In the wider sense, a proper rotation is defined as a direct isometry; i.e., an element of E+(3): it can also be the identity, a rotation with a translation along the axis, or a pure translation. A direct isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of 1. In either the narrower or the wider senses, the composition of two improper rotations is a proper rotation, and the composition of an improper and a proper rotation is an improper rotation.  Physical systems When studying the symmetry of a physical system under an improper rotation (e.g., if a system has a mirror symmetry plane), it is important to distinguish between vectors and pseudovectors (as well as scalars and pseudoscalars, and in general between tensors and pseudotensors), since the latter transform differently under proper and improper rotations (in 3 dimensions, pseudovectors are invariant under inversion).

Collins's artwork in particular gives the town detailed, realistic architecture and a consistent geography. The first strip from 19 October 1959. Thematically, the strip draws upon nostalgia for childhood experiences and often has a static, almost limbo-like atmosphere, in a similar manner to its companion strip in the Daily Mirror, Andy Capp. The main characters largely exist independently of 'the real world' and adults are only rarely seen; for example, every year the Perishers go on holiday but always get thrown off the train home, forcing them to walk and arrive home several weeks late (a joke on how a short scene in comic book time can take several weeks when told in daily installments), yet with seemingly no repercussions. Main characters =Wellington= An orphan boy who lives alone with his large dog, Boot. In the early days of the strip they lived in an approximately 10-foot (3 m) diameter concrete pipe section in a seemingly abandoned builder's yard. In 1966 he and Boot moved into a small railway station that had been closed by the Beeching Axe, and they have lived there ever since. Wellington takes his nickname from his trademark wellington boots ‚Äì he cannot afford proper shoes. He named his dog Boot to go with Wellington. Wellington is quite a solemn intellectual and given to philosophical trains of thought. He can also be quite resourceful ‚Äì he appears to support himself by selling handmade wooden buggies and pilfering food from sympathetic local shops, or convoluted schemes to create sudden crowds in order to celebrate his birthday on 25 October (which also happened to be Maurice Dodd's Birthday). Wellington can also be something of a worrier, always concerned that the world is going to rack an' rooney (rack and ruin). Over the years he has worried that the world is becoming clogged up with dirt, that people might get crushed by the weight of air above their heads, and that each new year might be the same old year recycled to save money. Actually there might be something in that; Wellington (unlike any other comic character) has noticed that he and his friends never seem to get any older. On those rare occasions when he cheers up, a small raincloud usually appears to dampen his spirits. =Boot= An Old English Sheepdog who lives with his boy, Wellington. Boot is a generally affable and mellow character, given to flights of fancy and daydreaming. In this respect, Boot is the UK equivalent of Snoopy from Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts strip. Boot is also convinced that he is in fact an 18th- century English lord enchanted into a dog by a gypsy wench (as he puts it, I knew I should have bought those damn clothespegs!) ‚Äì the strip gives occasional hints that this is actually true as opposed to another fantasy. As a lord, he demands to be treated with respect, and often tells Wellington so to his face. Unfortunately Wellington only hears barking. Wellington thinks Boot is lazy and should help out with the household chores, but Boot usually manages to find some way to \\"accidentally\\" mess things up in the hope that he won't be asked again. He hates taking baths, and his bathtime struggles with Wellington usually turn into epic battles. Boot's favourite food appears to be links of sausages, and his attempts to consume these in advance of Wellington provide the basis of many episodes. Boot was originally drawn with a short tail (on one occasion he met a bob-tailed sheepdog, and on hearing the name decided to call his own tail Fred), but Maurice Dodd later discovered that real Old English Sheepdogs' tails are docked, and so over the course of several years Collins drew his tail shorter and shorter until it vanished altogether ‚Äì Boot still appears completely white, rare for the breed. \\"Who is the Mother of Boot?\\" was a long-running mystery until a reader informed Wellington that Boot's dam was named \\"Cherry Blossom.\\" (\\"Cherry Blossom\\" happens to be a well-known brand of shoe and boot polish). =Marlon= Marlon is amiable but he is not very bright. This has not dampened his ambitions; he is enthusiastic and often tries his hand at inventing. The fact that most of his inventions ‚Äì fire, the wheel, the horse and cart and so forth ‚Äì had already been invented did not deter him, because he felt he was slowly catching up. He also claimed to have invented a \\"micro-stetho-deeposcope\\" ‚Äì supposedly a high-tech instrument for probing deeply below the earth's surface, but which actually turned out to be a piece of broken mirror tied to a chair leg. One of his culinary inventions did make a splash ‚Äì literally: the inch-thick ketchup sandwich (subsequently renamed the 2.5 cm-thick ketchup sandwich when Marlon decided to go metric). The splash in question occurred whenever he bit into one, caused by a huge dollop of ketchup hitting whoever happened to be standing nearby. The ketchup sandwich is used as a recurring gag, occasionally replaced with other types of filling for variety. Marlon also dreams of becoming either a brain surgeon (which is spelt brane surgeon in his speech balloons), or \\"a bloke wot goes down sewers in big rubber boots\\" ‚Äì he considers either career to be equally prestigious. In the meantime he spends his pocket money on Wellington's buggies, which usually results in a battle between Wellington's persuasive skills and Maisie's desire for him to spend the money on her. =Maisie= An adorable little girl ‚Äì at least, according to her. In fact she is domineering and a bully, with a tendency to become violent if she doesn't get her own way, and a scream that can stun woodworm. She is scared of insects and spiders; on one occasion, when Wellington tells her that the field they are walking through may contain thousands of hidden insects, she is too terrified to move. She has convinced herself she is in love with Marlon and continues to pursue him despite his continual resistance ‚Äì their relationship has been described as a one sided love triangle. She imagines herself and Marlon as the heroine and hero of a romantic novel ‚Äì he bold as a hawk, she soft as a dove. In reality, of course, she is tough as nails and he is thick as a plank. Another character trait of hers is a fondness for paper bags (and the contents thereof). It is usually Wellington who has just managed to scrape together enough money for sweets or fish and chips, which he has then to hide lest a rustle attract Maisie, who will appear, as if from nowhere, to inquire: \\"Need any help with that paper bag?\\" Maisie bears a resemblance to Lucy van Pelt in Charles Schulz's Peanuts strip. The British actress Maisie Williams was christened Margaret but has always been known as Maisie, after the character. =Baby Grumpling= A toddler, possibly named after the \\"Baby Dumpling\\" character in the US comic strip Blondie. In the early days of the strip he did not speak, because he knew that once he started he would be expected to keep talking all the time. When he finally began to speak he did so in entirely in lower-case letters. In the early days of the strip he was not related to the other characters, but was later revealed to be Maisie's little brother (a retcon ‚Äì in an earlier strip Maisie had referred to Baby Grumpling's parents as if they were not her own). He used to think that school was a prison from which the older Perishers were temporarily released each evening. He digs a lot of holes, which he always blames on worms (a significant part of his diet) or moles. He enjoys creating mischief with his space hopper, or by putting insects into Maisie's underwear drawer, when he isn't embarking on some improbable business venture or other (usually worm-related; he invented the wormburger, for instance, though nobody but Wellington ever bought one, and Wellington didn't initially believe it had real worms in it). He often discusses philosophy with the new baby (an unseen character in a pram). He is also frequently seen questioning the plausibility of fairy tales or nursery rhymes read out by Maisie, while at the same time vandalising an alarm clock or other household item. His teddy bear Gladly (short for \\"Gladly, my cross-eyed bear\\") puts in occasional appearances. Recurring characters Not all of these characters appeared during the same time periods * The Crabs: The crustacean inhabitants of a seaside rock pool, visited by Boot every year during the Perishers' summer holiday. Some of the crabs believe that Boot's eyes peering down at them annually are a mystical visitation ‚Äì \\"The Eyeballs in the Sky\\" ‚Äì and this belief is exploited by a preacher crab who uses their appearance as an excuse to extort money from his congregation. His efforts are always opposed by a scientist crab who continually attempts to invent a device to break through the surface of the pool and investigate what the \\"Eyeballs\\" really are, despite the preacher's protests that he will \\"rend the fabric of the pooliverse\\". The conflict usually ends up in a full-scale crab fight, and Boot is left none the wiser as to crustacean behaviour. Usually, one of the crabs claims that something is \\"bad fer y'r 'ealth\\". *Plain Jane: a friend of Maisie's, often seen selling potions and tonics from a home-made stall. *Fiscal Yere: a millionaire's son who always complains about the problems of being rich, whilst maintaining his chocolate cigar habit to the others' chagrin. *Fred Beetle and the Caterpillar: a pair of insects often encountered by Boot. Fred is a socialist who seems to be modelled on Fred Kite from I'm All Right Jack. The Caterpillar's chain-smoking habit has stunted his growth and prevented his metamorphosis into a butterfly. This is just as well since he doesn't like heights. *Adolf Kilroy: a tortoise shaped like a World War 2 German helmet. He thinks he is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and speaks in Fraktur. He sometimes teams up with Fred Beetle and Caterpillar in an attempt to overthrow Boot, but the fact that Boot is much bigger always defeats them. This character last appeared in the summer of 1983 and it is said upon his 1984 take-over of the Daily Mirror that Robert Maxwell, a Czech whose family had been murdered by Nazi German troops during the war, objected to the Kilroy character appearing in the strip. *B. H. (Calcutta) Failed: a kindly Indian bloodhound who lost his sense of smell in an unfortunate incident involving an elephant filled with curry which exploded in the noonday sun. B. H. literally bumped into Boot one day, and they have been good friends ever since, despite B. H.'s frequent attempts to steal Boot's meat bones. One of the strip's odder elements is B.H.'s claim to be a reporter for \\"The West Crunge Clarion and Dubious Advertiser\\", a low budget and downmarket local newspaper. He has a journalist's ear for an attention-grabbing headline, but his career may be held back by his inability to remember how to make the letter \\"b\\". *Tatty Oldbitt (the Sailors' Friend): an over-amorous female basset hound who likes to chase sailors ‚Äì although just what she intends to do if she catches one is probably best left unexplored. She also chases Boot from time to time, but since he considers himself a lord she never gets very far with him, and often ends up going off with B. H. instead. *Dirty McSquirty: the dirtiest boy in town, always accompanied by a cloud of flies. He resembles Pig-Pen in Charles Schultz's Peanuts strip. *Cousin Worsoff: an unseen character. Dirty McSquirty's cousin, he is the proverbial \\"person who is worse off than you\\". He lives in the sewer, and Dirty speaks to him through drain covers. *Poor girl: a girl who harasses Wellington with constant tales of poverty, despite wearing an impressive fur coat and claiming to have a household full of equally impoverished staff. *Beryl Bogey: a large and physically intimidating girl, or possibly gorilla, whose presence on Maisie's netball team gives them the ability to break down the opposition, literally. Her idol is King Kong. *The cat: an unnamed cat recently adopted by Wellington, much to Boot's annoyance. The cat and Boot are engaged in a permanent battle of wits. *The goldfish: another new pet of Wellington's. Contemplates philosophy while swimming around in his tiny bowl. *The water-snail: the most recent arrival, bought by Wellington to clean the goldfish's bowl. The snail considers this a degrading job. Catch phrases This is a partial list of the phrases coined or made popular by the Perishers. * \\"Go-faster stripes\\" ‚Äî Wellington's big selling-point on the buggies he tries to persuade Marlon to buy. It has become a way of describing any useless or frivolous addition to a product. * \\"GRONFF!!\\" ‚Äî The sound of Boot gobbling up something tasty, often something meant for another character, once the contents of a bird table. Also used sometimes when other characters eat. * \\" Parasite ! Trotskyite ! Marmite !\\" ‚Äî Insults hurled at each other by the Beetle and the Caterpillar whenever they brawl, which is frequently. Marmite is, of course, not exactly a valid insult, but does end in \\"-ite\\". * \\"Vilson Kepple und Betty!\\" ‚Äî Kilroy the Tortoise's favourite exclamation. It derives from the music hall stage act Wilson, Keppel and Betty. * \\"Need any help with that paper bag ?\\" ‚Äî Maisie can detect the opening of a bag of crisps from far away, appearing almost instantly to help with the consumption of the contents, uttering this phrase as soon as she arrives. * \\"Yeuk!!\\" ‚Äî Marlon's reaction to Maisie's perennial romantic advances. He responds to her in this way so often that Maisie has actually asked Marlon, \\"Is 'yeuk' the only word you know?\\" * \\"Ratbag\\" ‚Äî The kids' favourite insult. Absent from the very early days of the strip, it quickly became a staple. Maisie is particularly fond of the word, and constantly uses it to refer to Marlon. * \\"Berk\\" - New Baby's final response to anything said to it by Baby Grumpling. Might be construed as calling him a berk, but is intended as baby noise.Various Perishers Omnibus books Final strip and editorial comment A final, specially drawn strip appeared on the Daily Mirror's comic page on Saturday 10 June 2006. The strip depicts the silhouetted figures of Maisie, Baby Grumpling, Wellington, Boot and Marlon walking down a street into the sunset. Wellington says, \\"Well, dear readers, it's taken almost fifty years for you to see the back of us. In sayin' goodbye we hope that you remember us with the affecshun we feel for you.\\" The tone of the strip is reminiscent of Charles M. Schulz's final Peanuts strip, from which the Perishers strip took its inspiration. The strip was initially replaced by the short-lived Ronaldinho, during the then-ongoing World Cup. After the tournament, the American Pooch Cafe appeared as a more permanent replacement. Annuals Regular collections of the strip were published in book form. The first Perishers book was issued in the UK in 1963, often referred to as 'Meet the Perishers' but was in fact just titled 'The Perishers'. The second issue, 'The Perishers Strike Again', was published two years later in 1965. Further issues were then mostly published at the rate of two per year, commencing in 1968 (exceptions being three issued in 1972, and one in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977). A total of 27 annuals were released, the last being published in 1981. In 1974, in addition to the regular book, an omnibus collection of previously published strips was issued, followed by two further omnibus collections in 1975 and 1976. Reprints After a gap of nearly four years, the original cartoon strip returned to the Daily Mirror as reprints, on 22 February 2010 due to popular demand. Animation In 1979, 20 5-minute animated shorts featuring the strip's characters were made by Bill Melendez Productions (coincidentally, the same studio behind the Peanuts animated specials) for the BBC. LP record Around 1980 an LP record album entitled THE PERISHERS SING! (WELL SORT OF) was issued by Response Records. The lyrics written by Maurice Dodd and the music by Trevor Evan Jones. An instrumental version of the final track \\"It's Great to be a Kid\\" was also the theme music for the animated TV version. Dodd's official website claims 12 songs were penned, but the finished album only contained 10 tracks. It featured narration by Bernard Cribbins, and also credits Nicky James and Barbara Sexton with vocals. =Track list= Side 1: #Ole Boot and Me (Wellington) #Battle of Vindaloo (B.H.

Berwanger was a star halfback for the Chicago Maroons football team of the University of Chicago, where he was known as the \\"one man football team\\". In 1936, Berwanger became the first player drafted into the National Football League (NFL) in its inaugural 1936 NFL Draft, although he did not play professionally. College career In a 1934 game against the Michigan Wolverines, Berwanger left his mark on Michigan center Gerald Ford in the form of a distinctive scar beneath the future U.S. President's left eye. In 1935, Berwanger became the first recipient of the Downtown Athletic Club Trophy, renamed the Heisman Trophy the following year. He received 84 votes, finishing ahead of Army's Monk Meyer, Notre Dame's William Shakespeare, and Princeton's Pepper Constable. He was also awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference and earned unanimous All-America honors. Berwanger also competed in track and field for Chicago, setting a school decathlon record in 1936 that stood until 2007. In college, he was also a brother of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. After college In 1936, Berwanger was the first player ever drafted into the National Football League in its inaugural 1936 NFL draft. The Philadelphia Eagles selected him, but did not think they would be able to meet his reported salary demands of $1,000 per game. They traded his negotiating rights to the Chicago Bears for tackle Art Buss. Berwanger initially chose not to sign with the Bears in part to preserve his amateur status so that he could compete for a spot on the U.S. team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in the decathlon. After he missed the Olympics cut, Berwanger and Bears' owner George Halas were unable to reach an agreement on salary; Berwanger was requesting $15,000 and Halas' final offer was $13,500. Instead, he took a job with a Chicago rubber company and also became a part-time coach at the University of Chicago. Berwanger later expressed regret that he did not accept Halas' offer. Later life and honors After graduating, Berwanger worked briefly as a sportswriter and later became a manufacturer of plastic car parts. He was very modest about the Heisman Trophy; unsure what to do with the trophy, he left it with his aunt Gussie, who used it as a doorstop. The trophy was later bequeathed to the University of Chicago Athletic Hall of Fame, where it is on display. There is also a replica of the Heisman on display in the trophy case in the Nora Gymnasium at Dubuque Senior High School. He is a member of both the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame and Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. Berwanger died after a lengthy battle with lung cancer at his home in Oak Brook, Illinois, on June 26, 2002, at the age of 88.

A shapeshifting android assassin, the T-1000 is the main antagonist of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as well as a minor antagonist in Terminator Genisys and the theme park attraction T2 3-D: Battle Across Time. A similar Terminator, referred to as a T-1001, appears in the Fox television series, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.Fox.com In the films, the T-1000 was created by the franchise's main antagonist, Skynet, a machine artificial intelligence that directs its robotic creations against the Human Resistance in an all-out war. The T-1000 is described in Terminator 2 as being composed of liquid metal, or a mimetic polyalloy (nanorobotics) that it can manipulate to assume various forms. Aside from being able to camouflage itself by assuming the appearance of a nondescript object or take on the likeness of other humans that it terminates in pursuit of its goals, the T-1000's shapeshifting abilities enable it to form its hands into stabbing blades, slip through physical openings by oozing its liquid form, and instantly reform itself from any physical damage.Scifiscripts.com It is further explained in the prologue of the film's novelization that the T-1000 was created through nanotechnology, and is a \\"Nanomorph\\", able to scan the molecular structure of whatever it is touching and visually mimic it.Terminator 2: Judgment Day by Randall Frakes, James Cameron and William Wisher (June 1, 1991)() In Terminator 2, the T-1000's default form is portrayed by Robert Patrick, and in Terminator Genisys, by Lee Byung-hun, while other actors portray the T-1000 in the disguise of specific characters. In Terminator 2 and T2: 3-D Battle Across Time, the T-1000 is presented as a technological leap over the T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), also known as a Model 101.Trailer of Terminator 2 has the Schwarzenegger character identified as \\"800 Series Model 101\\" Described by AllMovie as \\"one of the most memorable roles in one of the most memorable films of the decade\\",Robert Patrick, All Movie Guide biography at The New York Times Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 earned him nominations for Best Villain and Best Supporting Actor at the 1992 MTV and Saturn Awards. The T-1000 was ranked #39 in the Online Film Critics Society's 2002 list of the \\"Top 100 Villains of All Time\\",\\"Top 100 Villains of All Time\\". Online Film Critics Society.

A tagline for the film was \\"This time there are two. Terminator 2.\\" Prior to the film's release, Robert Patrick was promoted as portraying \\"Austin\\", the name on the T-1000's police uniform ID tag. Writer/director James Cameron stated that his original intention for the sequel was that both Terminators sent to the past would be T-800s like the one played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, with one being stripped down to a metal endoskeleton like the one from the original film, The Terminator. Once Cameron actually started working on the script, in 1990, he figured a better way was to turn the evil Terminator into a more advanced model.\\"Interactive Modes\\", Terminator 2: Judgment Day Blu-Ray Cameron's original pick to play the T-1000 was rock musician Billy Idol, and storyboards had the robot resembling him, but a serious motorcycle accident prevented Idol from accepting the role. Blackie Lawless, the lead singer of W.A.S.P., was also considered for the role but he was deemed too tall. Then, Cameron thought of casting actor Michael Biehn, who played Kyle Reese in The Terminator, in the role with the explanation that Skynet managed to acquire Reese's DNA and use it for a new Terminator. Cameron ultimately dropped this idea after deciding the audience would find it too confusing: eventually casting came down to Robert Patrick, as a deliberate contrast to the original Terminator. Cameron stated \\"I wanted to find someone who would be a good contrast to Arnold. If the 800 series is a kind of human Panzer tank, then the 1000 series had to be a Porsche.\\" For a more machine-like performance, Patrick had to learn how to both fire a pistol without flinching (or blinking) and run effortlessly without heavy breathing or signs of exhaustion. The development of computer-generated imagery (CGI) by Industrial Light & Magic to manipulate, re-create, and \\"morph\\" the image of an actor was used in the creation of the T-1000 character in the film. The computer graphics composed 6 of the 15 minutes that the T-1000 displays its morphing and healing abilities. The other 9 were achieved in camera with the use of advanced animatronic puppets and prosthetic effects created by Stan Winston and his team, who were also responsible for the metal skeleton effects of the T-800.The Winston Effect: The Art & History of Stan Winston Studio The visual effects used in Terminator 2 to create the T-1000 won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. Entity FX, Inc. is responsible for the visual effects of the T-1001 on Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, along with the digital animation of endoskeletons, Hunter-Killers, and the future war sequences on the second season of the show. The company also contributed the digital imagery of James Cameron's True Lies and Titanic.Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles End Credits In Terminator Genisys, the effects of the T-1000 were made by British effects company Double Negative, also responsible for the T-3000 and T-5000 terminators. The animation was mostly similar to how it was done in Terminator 2, only with more advanced fluid simulations. To properly depict the liquid metal being dissolved by acid, Double Negative's artists studied acid burning through aluminum, and had its final distorted forms inspired by The Thing. Appearance and abilities The T-1000 in its default liquid metal form In the Terminator 2 storyline, the T-1000 is made of liquid metal. The T-800 explains that the T-1000 is a more advanced Terminator, composed entirely of a \\"mimetic polyalloy\\", rendering it capable of rapid shape shifting, near- perfect mimicry and recovery from damage. Furthermore, it can use its ability to liquify and assume alternative forms such as fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars, flattening itself and imitating the pattern and texture of the ground to hide or ambush targets. The T-1000 also has the ability to create small accessory items from itself. For example, it creates the appearance of a motorcycle helmet and sunglasses when necessary for its disguise. The T-1000 can also change its surface color and texture to convincingly simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. It is capable of accurately mimicking voices as well, including the ability to extrapolate a relatively small voice sample to generate a wider array of words or inflections as required. However, its morphing abilities are limited by complexity, mass, and volume: it cannot transform into complex machines with mechanical moving parts or chemical fuels (like guns or bombs), limiting it to stabbing weapons unless it acquires external hardware, and its volume prevents it from taking the form of a small object like a pack of cigarettes, although it is capable of impersonating larger people. Like all Terminators, the T-1000 possesses superhuman strength, greater than that of the T-800. Thanks to its morphing abilities and immunity to mechanical damage, it is shown to be capable of overpowering the T-800 in hand-to-hand combat, despite its more slender frame and smaller stature compared to its predecessor. It can also run fast enough to catch up to a police car accelerating away from it, although at times it can acquire and drive vehicles if it requires increased speed. The T-1000 is effectively impervious to physical injury and any damage to its body will only momentarily stagger it for as long as it takes to repair any wound or deformation. Bullet wounds are a minor inconvenience; the T-1000 can shrug off and repair injuries from small arms fire but high-kinetic impacts from shotgun blasts or a large explosion will knock it out for a few moments before it can recover. If a part of its body is detached, it will liquefy and flow back into the T-1000's body, with its detached nano parts being able to track the core of the body from a significant distance: in Terminator 2, one scene shows the detached parts are able to act independently at a distance of a few hundred meters. It is explained in the prologue to the novel adaptation of the film that the T-1000 is able to completely reform and reshape itself at will, due to its \\"cells\\" having been programmed by Skynet with on-board nanotechnology. This technology can be programmed with commands from Skynet, and can help the T-1000 scan the cellular makeup of whatever it is touching (including the DNA of living animals). When separated from the host each individual cell is programmed to detect and seek out larger groups of cells within a range of 29 kilometers. The T-1000's weaknesses are extreme temperatures, as shown in Terminator 2. When it is frozen solid from a coating of liquid nitrogen, it cannot move; it is then shot by the T-800 and shatters into pieces. However, the heat from a nearby crucible thaws out the individual pieces and they liquefy and flow back together, reforming the T-1000's body. After the Terminator shoots it with a grenade launcher, it is so distorted and off-balance from the gap in its torso that it slips and fell into a molten steel vat. It then shapeshifts uncontrollably into its previous human disguises/victims and it turns itself inside-out to try to shield itself from the molten steel, and is then permanently destroyed when the searing heat disassembles its nanotechnological \\"cells\\" on a microscopic level. It is also susceptible to chemical damage as shown in Terminator Genisys where Sarah tricks it into entering a room filled with sprinklers that rain down acidic chemicals. The T-1000 is also not specifically designed to encounter other Terminators and has little knowledge of their diagnostics. This allows the T-800 to take it by surprise. The T-1000 had previously shut the T-800 down, but did not know of the older model's emergency reboot power mode. It is stated in Terminator 3 that the T-X was designed with the knowledge necessary to destroy other Terminators and thus diagnostic files of other Terminators was in its internal database. The Special Edition DVD release of Terminator 2 contains additional scenes in the steel foundry showing that the damaging effects of being frozen, shattered and thawed cause the T-1000 to glitch, causing it to uncontrollably morph and match its surface with objects it touches against the T-1000's will (such as its hand sticking to, and taking on the metallic texture and yellow/black caution striping of a guardrail). The glitch enables John Connor to see through its ruse when it tries to impersonate his mother, as its feet take on the color and texture of the grated metal floor on which it stood. In addition, after killing John's foster parents and dog, the T-1000 uses its hands to scan John's bedroom for genetic and psychological information, including DNA. The T-1000 is apparently capable of espionage and detective skills, as it often attempts to accomplish its goals by subterfuge and deception instead of brute force and extreme violence as the earlier T-800 resorted to. Its main disguise for the duration of Terminator 2 is as a police officer, allowing it to gain trust, access information, and provide a benign, friendly appearance. It also imitates John Connor's foster mother, Janelle Voight, to try to gain John's confidence. In fact, the T-1000 is able to pass as human, possessing a larger repertoire of emotional expression and interpersonal skills than earlier Terminator models. While the earlier T-800 also had some non-violent interactions and used a phone book to track Sarah Connor, T-1000 uses a variety of deceptions and is much more human-like.In Terminator 2, examples of the T-1000's emotional expression include the following; it spares a brief moment of bemusement after seeing a clothing store mannequin that resembles its liquid metal form, it looks shocked when its arm breaks off due to being frozen with liquid nitrogen, displays frustration and anger towards the Model 101 when it thwarts its attempt to force Sarah to call John out of hiding, wags its finger in a \\"tsk-tsk\\" gesture at Sarah after she fails to destroy it in the steel mill, exhibits a stunned expression after being significantly disrupted by a grenade, and shows genuine agony when it is freezing and when it is dropped into the molten steel. It is also capable of exploiting the emotions of its targets, as in the steel foundry when it tortures Sarah Connor to call out for her son, anticipating that she would respond accordingly. A T-1000 demonstrates annoyance when dealing with the T-800, in Terminator 2 and another T-1000 demonstrates annoyance with Kyle Reese in Terminator: Genisys, and tilts its head in salute to Sarah when she devises a method to distinguish it from the person it mimics. Additionally, it is able to express fear and pain, as demonstrated in Terminator 2 when the T-1000 gives a brief look of shock after the T-800 shoots a grenade into its stomach, and when it writhes in agony after falling into a vat of molten metal. The same is shown in Genisys, when the Guardian holds it under a hydrochloric acid shower and it frantically struggles to get free before it is destroyed. In Genisys, it is also shown that the T-1000 has the ability to repair damaged machines and use its own body as independent weapons and gadgets, such as a spear or a tracking device. It severs its own arm and hurls it as a javelin to impale the Guardian to a wall, it reactivates a broken T-800 by infusing it with some polyalloy and it latches a piece of itself onto a lock in order to track the Guardian's truck. Films =Terminator 2: Judgment Day= Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the T-1000 (Patrick) is sent by Skynet back in time to kill a young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the Human Resistance against Skynet. The T-1000 ambushes a Los Angeles Police Department police officer on arrival and takes on his identity, tracking down John Connor through the police cruiser's on- board computer and eventually confronting him in a shopping mall. As it prepares to kill John, a T-800 Model 101 sent by the Resistance to protect John shows up to engage it. Following a brief scuffle and a lengthy car chase, the T-800 and John escape from the T-1000. It returns to John's foster home and takes the place of his foster mother, Janelle Voight (Jenette Goldstein), intending to wait for John to return, but John calls ahead and the T-800 is able to confirm that the T-1000 has infiltrated the house when it incorrectly names John's dog. After learning of the deception and killing John's foster father (Xander Berkeley), the T-1000 is thwarted again at Pescadero State Hospital, where John and the T-800 rescue John's mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before the T-1000 can copy and terminate her, and again escape from it. After tracking the Connors and the T-800 to Cyberdyne Systems Corporation headquarters, it gives chase and crashes a truck carrying liquid nitrogen into a steel mill. The T-1000 is frozen solid by leaking liquid nitrogen, allowing the T-800 to shatter it with a single pistol round. After the T-1000 reforms (but its shapeshifting capability malfunctions) the T-800 engages it in hand- to-hand combat, to buy time for Sarah and John, but is defeated and shut down in the process. The T-1000 then continues the hunt for John, unaware that the T-800 has rerouted power and reactivated itself. The T-1000 copies Sarah's form and confronts John but is stopped by the real Sarah. It survives Sarah's shotgun blasts but is finally done in by the T-800 who fires his last grenade, which detonates inside the T-1000. While attempting to reform, it stumbles and falls backwards into a vat of molten steel. Unable to stand the high temperature it is melted and consumed. =Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines= Despite failing to eliminate John Connor (Nick Stahl), it is later revealed in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines that the T-1000 inadvertently interfered with the development of his relationships with Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), with whom he attended junior high school, and her father, Robert (David Andrews), who is overseeing the development of Skynet in the third film. The T-1000's successor is the T-X, designed to not only terminate humans but also rogue Terminators reprogrammed by the Resistance, an \\"anti- terminator terminator\\" as stated by John Connor. The T-X is a composite of the T-800 and T-1000, combining the former's solid endoskeleton covered with the latter's liquid metal \\"mimetic polyalloy\\", allowing it to take the shape of any humanoid it touches. Because it is only coated in this material, it is possible to remove it from the endoskeleton using immensely strong magnetic force, such as that from a cyclic particle accelerator. Having a solid endoskeleton did solve some of the T-1000's problems, namely being deformed by temperature extremes and explosives while also lacking built-in ranged weaponry. However, the endoskeleton makes the T-X less flexible than its T-1000 predecessor, in that the T-X does not have the ability to liquefy and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars and narrow openings, or flattening itself. As a result, the T-X is eventually defeated when its legs are lost after a helicopter crashes into it and its main body destroyed when the T-101 sent back to fight it triggers its own internal power cell to explode while in close proximity to its opponent. =Terminator Genisys= Lee Byung-hun played the T-1000 in Terminator Genisys. South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun portrays a T-1000 in Terminator Genisys. In the film, it is revealed that a T-1000 was sent back to terminate Sarah Connor (portrayed by Willa Taylor as a child) at Big Bear Lake in 1973. It kills her parents but she escaped, and is subsequently found by a reprogrammed T-800 whom she refers to as \\"Pops,\\" (credited as \\"Guardian\\") sent by an unknown party to be her guardian. The subsequent arrivals of the two androids effectively alters the course of Sarah's life. Eleven years later, in the form of an Asian American LAPD police officer, the T-1000 intercepts Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) after Kyle arrives from 2029. As Kyle has no experience battling a T-1000, he is unable to defeat it. The T-1000 chases Reese into an adjacent clothing store, where Reese steals clothing only to be accosted by two police officers, Garber and O'Brien, who handcuff him. The T-1000 attacks, killing Garber, and almost killing O'Brien and Reese before it is interrupted by the arrival of Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and the Guardian (Schwarzenegger) in an armored truck. By latching a piece of itself onto the truck's back door hinge, the T-1000 tails the three to the Guardian's warehouse base and attacks them again. It uses pieces of itself to pin the Guardian to a wall and to reactivate Skynet's T-800 to chase Kyle Reese while pursuing Sarah. It masquerades as Reese in an attempt to fool Sarah, but Sarah sees through the ruse and lures the T-1000 into a shower of hydrochloric acid, severely destabilizing its molecular structure and weakening it. Despite this, it tries to kill Sarah, but the Guardian grabs it and holds it under the acid shower until it disintegrates completely, destroying it. In the film's climactic battle, the damaged Guardian is thrown into Cyberdyne's vat of liquid metal to be used for the creation of T-1000s which restores it and gives it the shapeshifting abilities of a T-1000. Original draft McG, the director of Terminator Salvation, previously mentioned that the T-1000 would be reintroduced in what was to be his concept of the fifth film: \\"I like the idea and the perspective for the next picture that you meet Robert Patrick the way he looks today, and he's a scientist that's working on, you know, improving cell replication so we can stay healthier and we can cure diabetes and do all these things that sound like good ideas, and to once again live as idealized expressions as ourselves.\\" He also said the origin story they had in mind for the T-1000 would satirize the world's \\"obsession\\" with youth and aging. This concept, however, was scrapped when the series was rebooted with Terminator Genisys, in which the T-1000 was portrayed by Lee Byung-hun. =Terminator: Dark Fate= In Terminator: Dark Fate, Gabriel Luna portrays the Rev-9, an advanced combination of both the T-800 and the T-1000. The Rev-9 originated from another A.I. called Legion, and is able to split into two separate units: an endoskeleton and a liquid-metal unit. Like the T-1000, it can take on the physical appearance of anyone it touches. =Non-Terminator films= * Robert Patrick parodied his T-1000 character in the 1992 film Wayne's World. In a scene where Wayne is pulled over for speeding, Patrick - dressed in a police uniform - pulls out a picture of Edward Furlong (the actor who played John Connor) and asks Wayne if he has seen him, in the same manner he did in Terminator 2. This results in Wayne screaming in terror and driving away. * Robert Patrick as the T-1000 also briefly appeared in the 1993 film Last Action Hero as it was seen walking out the same building that Danny and Jack Slater (played by Schwarzenegger) were entering. Danny tries to tell Jack about the T-1000 he just saw, but Jack ignores him completely. Attraction =T2-3D: Battle Across Time= Patrick reprised his role as the T-1000 in T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a Universal Studios theme park movie ride. In this short film, The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) takes John Connor (Furlong) to the year 2029 to aid him in destroying Skynet once and for all. On their way, the T-1000 chases after John and the Terminator while they are on a motorcycle. They lose its pursuit after the Terminator shoots at it with a shotgun several times. Television =Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles= A T-1001 Terminator, a second liquid metal prototype, is introduced in the 2008 television series, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles at the start of the show's second season (though sometimes misidentified as a T-1000 by reviewers). It masquerades as Catherine Weaver (Shirley Manson), the co- founder and current CEO of ZeiraCorp. \\"Weaver\\" often has mixed results when socially interacting both with subordinates at ZeiraCorp and Weaver's daughter Savannah (portrayed by Mackenzie Smith), but was written with an improved ability to adapt to and sustain itself in changing situations more adeptly than prior Terminators. It was unable to make convincing smiles or relate to people, despite being more advanced than the T-1000, which seemed to be better at social interaction. However, the T-1001 was able to successfully lead a company and use literary allegories. The T-1001's mission remains unclear throughout the television series, but diverts from the single-minded attempts to assassinate the Connors, as seen in the prior films. Through most of the TV series, the T-1001, as well as Sarah Connor and her allies, did not appear to be aware of each other's existence. As the head of ZeiraCorp, the T-1001 diverts that company's resources into developing an artificial intelligence, titled \\"Project Babylon\\", which appeared sufficient to combat Skynet's development. Catherine Weaver is first seen in the second season opener when she purchases the late Andy Goode's Turk computer system for $300,000 from an associate and then introduces this new computer system to her department heads to reveal her plans to create a new artificial intelligence computer system. Towards this end, Catherine Weaver recruits FBI Special Agent James Ellison to find and capture a Terminator in order to reverse engineer it using a variety of deceptions. Until the end of the series, Ellison is never aware of Weaver's true nature. Ellison delivers a T-888 Terminator's body to Weaver after it was critically damaged by Connor's Terminator bodyguard. The T-1001 advocates learning more about the 'robots' in order to prevent Judgment Day. With Ellison's initial mission complete, it assigns him to act as tutor/mentor to the nascent AI now connected to the T-888's body, which Weaver nicknames \\"John Henry\\". John Henry quickly identifies Weaver as a machine, albeit different from itself, but obeys Weaver's instruction not to share that information with anyone, assuring him that everything done at ZeiraCorp is for John Henry's benefit. At one point, Weaver reveals a clue to the nature of its mission when it tells Ellison that Savannah's future safety is dependent upon John Henry, but that the reverse is not the case. This appears to be in contradiction to the assumption that Weaver was coordinating the efforts to develop Skynet to eradicate humanity. In the television series, the true nature of the T-1001's entire mission is never revealed, and much of what Weaver does in furtherance of it seems contradictory. In one of the episodes that shifts between the present day and post-Judgment Day, it is learned that leader of the resistance, John Connor, asked a liquid metal Terminator to join him, and the Terminator refused. In the series finale, by way of introduction, the T-1001 asks (using the same phrase) the same of Connor (and his bodyguard Cameron, who was privy to the aforementioned events in the future) through Ellison, sent as intermediary. Also in the season/series finale, when Sarah Connor and John Connor finally meet Catherine Weaver face-to-face at her office, Ellison, Sarah, and John all discover Weaver's true nature when she uses her Terminator liquid metal abilities to form a shield to protect them from a flying Kaliba Corp drone which crash-dives into the ZeiraCorp building. When Sarah Connor discovers that ZeiraCorp possesses Andy Goode's Turk, she assumes that Weaver is constructing Skynet but Weaver corrects her by stating that she is \\"building something to fight it.\\" Upon entering the basement, the four discover that John Henry has transported himself to the future with Cameron's chip, leaving Cameron's empty body. When Ellison and Sarah Connor decline to jump forward in time with Weaver and John Connor, Weaver instructs Ellison to pick up Savannah from gymnastics. Weaver then transports itself and John Connor to a post-Judgment Day future in which John Connor is not known to the human resistance. Though Connor and the T-1001 arrived naked, the T-1001 forms \\"clothing\\" a moment later. After briefly talking to John, the Terminator slips away when the human resistance encounters John, thus leaving its whereabouts unknown. Comics =Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Nuclear Twilight= In the Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Nuclear Twilight comic published by Malibu Comics in 1996, an injured Tech-Com soldier named \\"Griffith\\" is abducted by a troop of T-800 Terminators and brought back to Skynet. He is drugged and, while in a delirious state (believing he has died and gone to Heaven), questioned by Skynet about Tech-Com's acquisition of a T-800 unit. After he has supplied all the information he is aware of, two T-1000 Terminators enter the room and assume his appearance before killing him. One is sent to infiltrate the human resistance, the other sent through time to kill John Connor as outlined in the Terminator 2 movie. In the simultaneously published Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Cybernetic Dawn, set just after the film, a female T-1000 and two T-800s come to the present to make sure the creation of Skynet happens as planned. =Terminator/RoboCop: Kill Human= In the second crossover between Terminator and RoboCop, the T-1000 plays a fairly significant role. It is the same model as from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. His role is not changed, he still intends to kill John Connor, but this time he must confront RoboCop as well to get to John Connor. RoboCop manages to save John and Sarah because he came from the future to stop the downfall of humanity, which even with the resistance fighting back, the war was lost for humanity. RoboCop shows no interest in keeping John and Sarah safe however, all he wants to do is prevent the future from happening. The T-1000 finds his targets on a naval base, set up by RoboCop. He gets in, but the vessel they are on begins to sink, but even with some help from the re-activated T-800 unit, John Connor is dead and the vessel sinks to the bottom of the sea, with everyone on board possibly drowning in the fight. Even the two Terminators and RoboCop who are destroyed by a chemical compound designed to destroy metals, which has seeped into the waters.

It is named after Thomas Willis (1621‚Äì1675), an English physician. Structure The circle of Willis is a part of the cerebral circulation and is composed of the following arteries: * Anterior cerebral artery (left and right) * Anterior communicating artery * Internal carotid artery (left and right) * Posterior cerebral artery (left and right) * Posterior communicating artery (left and right) The middle cerebral arteries, supplying the brain, are not considered part of the circle of Willis. =Origin of arteries= The left and right internal carotid arteries arise from the left and right common carotid arteries. The posterior communicating artery is given off as a branch of the internal carotid artery just before it divides into its terminal branches - the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral artery forms the anterolateral portion of the circle of Willis, while the middle cerebral artery does not contribute to the circle. The right and left posterior cerebral arteries arise from the basilar artery, which is formed by the left and right vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries. The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries and could be said to arise from either the left or right side. All arteries involved give off cortical and central branches. The central branches supply the interior of the circle of Willis, more specifically, the Interpeduncular fossa. The cortical branches are named for the area they supply. Since they do not directly affect the circle of Willis, they are not dealt with here. =Variation= Considerable anatomic variation exists in the circle of Willis. Based on a study of 1413 brains, the classic anatomy of the circle is only seen in 34.5% of cases. In one common variation the proximal part of the posterior cerebral artery is narrow and its ipsilateral posterior communicating artery is large, so the internal carotid artery supplies the posterior cerebrum; this is known as a fetal posterior communicating cerebral artery. In another variation the anterior communicating artery is a large vessel, such that a single internal carotid supplies both anterior cerebral arteries; this is known as an azygos anterior cerebral artery. Function The arrangement of the brain's arteries into the circle of Willis creates redundancy (analogous to engineered redundancy) for collateral circulation in the cerebral circulation. If one part of the circle becomes blocked or narrowed (stenosed) or one of the arteries supplying the circle is blocked or narrowed, blood flow from the other blood vessels can often preserve the cerebral perfusion well enough to avoid the symptoms of ischemia. Clinical significance =Aneurysms= Circle of Willis with the most common locations of ruptured aneurysms marked =Subclavian steal syndrome= The redundancies that the circle of Willis introduce can also lead to reduced cerebral perfusion. In subclavian steal syndrome, blood is \\"stolen\\" from the circle of Willis to preserve blood flow to the upper limb. Subclavian steal syndrome results from a proximal stenosis (narrowing) of the subclavian artery, an artery supplied by the aorta, which is also the same blood vessel that eventually feeds the circle of Willis via the vertebral and internal carotid arteries.

He served as Archbishop of New York from 1984 until his death in 2000, and was created a cardinal in 1985. He previously served as a U.S. Navy chaplain (1952‚Äì1979, including four years as Chief), auxiliary bishop of the Military Vicariate of the United States (1979‚Äì1983), and Bishop of Scranton (1983‚Äì1984). Early life, education, and military career O'Connor was born in Philadelphia, the fourth of five children of Thomas J. O'Connor, and Dorothy Magdalene (n√©e Gomple) O'Connor (1886‚Äì1971), daughter of Gustave Gumpel, a kosher butcher and Jewish rabbi. In 2014, his sister Mary O'Connor Ward discovered through genealogical research that their mother was born Jewish and was baptized as a Roman Catholic at age 19. John's parents were wed the following year. O'Connor during his naval career O'Connor attended public schools until his junior year of high school, when he enrolled in West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys. He then enrolled at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, and upon graduating was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia on December 15, 1945, by Hugh L. Lamb, then an auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese. He initially taught at St. James High School in Chester, Pennsylvania. O'Connor joined the United States Navy Chaplain Corps in 1952 during the Korean War, and rose through the ranks to become a rear admiral and Chief of Chaplains of the Navy. He served as Chief of Chaplains from 1975, for a period of four years, retiring in 1979. He obtained approval for the establishment of the RP [Religious Program Specialist] Enlisted Rating, and oversaw the process of standing up this rating, initially accepting transfers from other enlisted rates. The RP rating provided chaplains with a dedicated enlisted community, instead of yeomen transferred to assist a chaplain for a period before returning to their nominal yeoman rate. During this period, he was made an Honorary Prelate of His Holiness, with the title of Right Reverend Monsignor, on October 27, 1966. O'Connor obtained a master's degree in advanced ethics from Villanova University and a doctorate in political science from Georgetown University, where he studied under the United States' future Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick said of O'Connor that he was \\"... surely one of the two or three smartest graduate students I've ever had.\\"Rosin, Hanna; McCarthy, Colman (May 4, 2000). \\"Cardinal John J. O'Connor Dies\\", The Washington Post. Bishop On April 24, 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed O'Connor as auxiliary bishop of the Military Vicariate for the United States, subsequently reorganized as the Archdiocese for the Military Services in 1985, and titular bishop of Cursola. He was consecrated to the episcopate on May 27, 1979, at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome by John Paul himself, with Cardinals Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy and Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo as co-consecrators. On May 6, 1983, John Paul II named O'Connor Bishop of Scranton, and he was installed in that position on the following June 29. Archbishop of New York On January 26, 1984, after the death of Cardinal Terence Cooke three months earlier, O'Connor was appointed Archbishop of New York and administrator of the Military Vicariate of the United States, and installed on March 19. He was elevated to cardinal in the consistory of May 25, 1985, with the titular church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome (the traditional one for the Archbishop of New York from 1946 to 2009). As archbishop, O'Connor skillfully used the power and prestige of his office to bear witness to traditional Catholic doctrine. Upon his death, The New York Times called O'Connor \\"a familiar and towering presence, a leader whose views and personality were forcefully injected into the great civic debates of his time, a man who considered himself a conciliator, but who never hesitated to be a combatant\\", and one of the Catholic Church's \\"most powerful symbols on moral and political issues.\\" At the same time, he was often criticized for large budget deficits and a lack of financial discipline, which had to be remedied after his tenure. In the words of his friend and co-author, Mayor Ed Koch: \\"Cardinal O'Connor was a great man, but he was like the Pentagon. He was incapable of saving money.\\" =Sanctity of all life= O'Connor believed in protecting all human life and was a forceful opponent of abortion, human cloning, capital punishment, human trafficking, and unjust war. He assailed what he called the \\"horror of euthanasia\\", asking rhetorically, \\"What makes us think that permitted lawful suicide will not become obligated suicide?\\" In 2000, O'Connor called for a \\"major overhaul\\" of the punitive Rockefeller drug laws, which he believed produced \\"grave injustices\\". =Critiques of US military actions= Despite his years spent as a naval chaplain and admiral, O'Connor offered severe critiques of some United States military policies. In the 1980s, he condemned US support for counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central America, opposed the U.S. mining of the waters off Nicaragua, questioned spending on new weapons systems, and preached caution in regard to American military actions abroad. In 1998, O'Connor questioned whether the United States' cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan were morally justifiable. In 1999, during the Kosovo War, he used his weekly column in the archdiocesan newspaper, Catholic New York, to challenge repeatedly the morality of NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia, suggesting that it did not meet the Catholic Church's criteria for a Just War, and going so far as to ask, \\"Does the relentless bombing of Yugoslavia prove the power of the Western world or its weakness?\\" Three years before the 9/11 attacks on New York City, O'Connor insisted that the traditional Just War principles must be applied to evaluate the morality of military responses to unconventional warfare and terrorism. =Relations with organized labor= O'Connor's father had been a lifelong union member and O'Connor was a passionate defender of organized labor, as well as an advocate for the poor and the homeless. Early in his New York tenure, O'Connor set a pro-labor direction for the archdiocese. During a strike in 1984 by SEIU 1199, the largest health care workers union in New York, O'Connor strongly criticized the League of Voluntary Hospitals, of which the archdiocese was a member, for threatening to fire striking union members who refused to return to work, calling it \\"strikebreaking\\" and vowing that no Catholic hospital would do so. The following year, when a contract with 1199 still had not been reached, he threatened to break with the league and settle with the union unilaterally to reach an agreement \\"that gives justice to the workers\\". In his homily during a Labor Day Mass at St. Patrick's in 1986, O'Connor expressed his strong commitment to organized labor: \\"[S]o many of our freedoms in this country, so much of the building up of society, is precisely attributable to the union movement, a movement that I personally will defend despite the weakness of some of its members, despite the corruption with which we are all familiar that pervades all society, a movement that I personally will defend with my life.\\" In 1987, when the television broadcast employees' union was on strike against NBC, a non-union crew from NBC appeared at the cardinal's residence to cover one of O'Connor's press conferences. O'Connor declined to admit them, directing his secretary to \\"tell them they're not invited.\\" Following his death, SEIU 1199 published a 12-page tribute to O'Connor, calling him \\"the patron saint of working people\\". It described his support for low-wage and other workers, his efforts in helping the limousine drivers unionize, his helping end a strike at The Daily News, and his pushing for fringe benefits for minimum-wage home health care workers. =Relations with the Jewish community= O'Connor played an active role in Catholic‚ÄìJewish relations. He strongly denounced anti-Semitism, declaring that one \\"cannot be a faithful Christian and an anti-Semite. They are incompatible, because anti- Semitism is a sin.\\" He wrote an apology to Jewish leaders in New York City for past harm done to the Jewish community. O'Connor criticized Swiss banks' failure to compensate victims of the Holocaust, which he called \\"a human rights issue, an issue of the human race.\\" Even when disagreeing with him over political questions, Jewish leaders acknowledged that O'Connor was \\"a friend, a powerful voice against anti-Semitism\\". The Jewish Council for Public Affairs called him, \\"a true friend and champion of Catholic‚ÄìJewish relations, [and] a humanitarian who used the power of his pulpit to advocate for disadvantaged people throughout the world and in his own community.\\" Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel called O'Connor, \\"a good Christian\\" and a man \\"who understands our pain.\\" =Relations with the gay community= O'Connor adhered to the Catholic teaching that homosexual acts are never permissible, while homosexual desires are disordered but not in themselves sinful. Following a 1989 protest at the Cathedral where ACT UP members disrupted Mass and desecrated the Eucharist, O'Connor made an effort to minister to 1,000 people dying of AIDS and their families, following up on other AIDS patients he had ministered to. He visited Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center, where he cleaned the sores and emptied the bedpans of more than 1,100 patients. He was very popular with the patients, many of whom did not know he was the archbishop, and was supportive of other priests who ministered to gay men and others with AIDS. He personally led the 1990 funeral Mass for James Zappalorti, a Navy veteran who was murdered on Staten Island for being gay. In the years after this event, O'Connor endorsed a statewide hate crime law that included crimes motivated by sexual orientation, which passed shortly after his own death in 2000. O'Connor actively opposed Executive Order 50, a mayoral order issued in 1980 by Mayor Ed Koch, which required all city contractors, including religious entities, to provide services on a non-discriminatory basis with respect to race, creed, age, sex, handicap, as well as \\"sexual orientation or preference\\". After the Salvation Army received a warning from the city that its contracts for child care services would be canceled for refusing to comply with the executive order's provisions regarding sexual orientation, the Archdiocese of New York and Agudath Israel, an Orthodox Jewish organization, threatened to cancel their contracts with the city if forced to comply. O'Connor maintained that the executive order would cause the Catholic Church to appear to condone homosexual activity. Writing in Catholic New York in January 1985, O'Connor characterized the order as \\"an exceedingly dangerous precedent [that would] invite unacceptable governmental intrusion into and excessive entanglement with the Church's conducting of its own internal affairs.\\" Drawing the traditional Catholic distinction between homosexual \\"inclinations\\" and \\"behavior\\", he stated that \\"we do not believe that homosexual behavior ... should be elevated to a protected category.\\" > We do not believe that religious agencies should be required to employ those > engaging in or advocating homosexual behavior. We are willing to consider on > a case-by-case basis the employment of individuals who have engaged in or > may at some future time engage in homosexual behavior. We approach those who > have engaged in or may engage in what the Church considers illicit > heterosexual behavior the same way. ...We believe, however, that only a > religious agency itself can properly determine the requirements of any > particular job within that agency, and whether or not a particular > individual meets or is reasonably likely to meet such requirements. Subsequently, the Salvation Army, the archdiocese, and Agudath Israel, together with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, brought suit against the City of New York to overturn the executive order on the grounds that the mayor had exceeded his executive authority in issuing it. In September 1984, the New York Supreme Court agreed with the religious entities and struck down that part of the executive order that prohibited discrimination based upon \\"sexual orientation or affectational preference\\" on the grounds that the mayor had exceeded his authority. In June 1985, New York's highest court upheld the lower court's decision striking down the executive order. O'Connor vigorously and actively opposed city and state legislation guaranteeing the civil rights of homosexual persons, including legislation (supported by then-Mayors Ed Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani) prohibiting discrimination based upon sexual orientation in housing, public accommodations and employment. O'Connor also supported the decision by the Ancient Order of Hibernians to exclude the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization from marching under its own banner in New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade. The Hibernians argued that their decision as to which organizations may march in the parade, which honors Saint Patrick, a Catholic saint, was protected by the First Amendment and that they could not be compelled to admit a group whose beliefs conflicted with theirs. In 1992, in a decision criticized by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the City of New York ordered the Hibernians to admit the gay organization to march in the parade. The city subsequently denied the Hibernians a permit for the parade until, in 1993, a federal judge in New York held that the city's permit denial was \\"patently unconstitutional\\" because the parade was private, not public, and constituted \\"a pristine form of speech\\" as to which the parade sponsor had a right to control the content and tone. In 1987, O'Connor prohibited DignityUSA, an organization of gay Catholics, from holding Masses in parishes in the archdiocese. After eight years of protests by the group, O'Connor started meeting with the group twice a year. =HIV and condom controversy= O'Connor opposed condom distribution as an AIDS-prevention measure, viewing it as being contrary to the Catholic Church's teaching that contraception is immoral and its use a sin. O'Connor rejected the argument that condoms distributed to gay men are not contraceptives. O'Connor's response was that using an \\"evil act\\" was not justified by good intentions, and that the church should not be seen as encouraging sinful acts among others (other fertile heterosexual couples who might wrongly interpret his narrow support as license for their own contraception). He also claimed that sexual abstinence is a sure way to prevent infection, claiming condoms were only 50% effective against HIV transmission. HIV activist group ACT UP was appalled by the cardinal's apparent opinion that it was sinful for an HIV-positive person to use a condom to prevent transmission of HIV to his HIV-negative partner, an opinion they believe would translate directly into more deaths. This caused many of the confrontations between the group and the cardinal. Early on in the AIDS epidemic, O'Connor approved the opening of a specialized AIDS unit to provide medical care for the sick and dying in the former St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, the first of its kind in the state. He often nurtured and ministered to dying AIDS patients, many of whom were homosexual. Even though he condemned homosexual acts, he would not allow his moral differences to interfere with ministering to patients. Some members of ACT UP protested in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, holding placards such as \\"Cardinal O'Connor Loves Gay People ... If They Are Dying of AIDS.\\" In 1987, Ronald Reagan appointed O'Connor to the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic, also known as the Watkins Commission. O'Connor served with 12 other members, few of whom were AIDS experts, including James D. Watkins, Richard DeVos, and Penny Pullen. The commission was initially controversial among HIV researchers and activists as lacking expertise on the disease and as being in disarray. The Watkins Commission surprised many of its critics, however, by issuing a final report in 1988 that lent conservative support for antibias laws to protect HIV-positive people, on-demand treatment for drug addicts, and the speeding of AIDS-related research. The New York Times praised the commission's \\"remarkable strides\\" and its proposed $2 billion campaign against AIDS among drug addicts. The Watkins Commission's recommendations were similar to the recommendations subsequently made by a committee of HIV experts appointed by the National Academy of Sciences. On December 10, 1989, 4,500 members of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) and Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM) held a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral to voice their opposition to the cardinal's positions on AIDS education, the distribution of condoms in public schools, and abortion. The protest resulted in 43 arrests inside the cathedral. At the time, it was the largest demonstration against the Catholic Church in history, and remained so until Pope Benedict XVI's visit in 2010 to the United Kingdom spurred protests by approximately 20,000 people. =Clergy sex abuse= On October 29, 2018, Cardinal Agostino Cacciavillan said that during his time as papal nuncio to the United States in 1994, prior to Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States in 1995, he received a phone call from a woman concerning Archbishop Theodore Edgar McCarrick of Newark. The woman was worried that there would be a \\"media scandal if the Pope goes to Newark\\" because of \\"voices (rumors) about McCarrick's behavior with seminarians.\\" Cacciavillan then told O'Connor about the woman's call. O'Connor supposedly conducted an \\"investigation, an inquiry\\" and eventually told Cacciavillan that \\"there was no obstacle to the visit of the Pope to Newark.\\" Cacciavillan stated that he did not attempt to contact the Vatican. According to Andrea Tornielli's book Il Giorno del Giudizio, O'Connor wrote a letter to Nuncio Gabriel Montalvo Higuera and to the Congregation for Bishops in October 1999 arguing against the appointment of McCarrick as Archbishop of Washington with reference to his sexual harassment of seminarians. In 2018, McCarrick was revealed to have sexually abused numerous young boys, seminarians, and priests. Illness and death When O'Connor reached the retirement age for bishops of 75 years in January 1995, he submitted his resignation to Pope John Paul II as required by canon law, but the Pope did not accept it. He was diagnosed in 1999 as having a brain tumor, from which he eventually died. He continued to serve as Archbishop of New York until his death. O'Connor died in the archbishop's residence on May 3, 2000, and was interred in the crypt beneath the main altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former President George H. W. Bush, Texas Governor George W. Bush, New York Governor George Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former New York City Mayors Ed Koch, and David Dinkins were among the dignitaries who attended his funeral, which was presided over by the Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano. At O'Connor's request, the homily was delivered by Cardinal Bernard F. Law and the eulogy was delivered by Cardinal William W. Baum. Legacy Congressional Gold Medal awarded to O'Connor O'Connor was posthumously awarded the Jackie Robinson Empire State Medal of Freedom by New York Governor George Pataki on December 21, 2000. On March 7, 2000, O'Connor was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by unanimous support in the United States Senate and only one vote against the resolution in the United States House of Representatives. The John Cardinal O'Connor Pavilion in Riverdale, Bronx, a residence for retired priests, opened in 2003. The John Cardinal O'Connor School in Irvington, New York, for students with learning differences, opened in 2009. The largest student-run pro-life conference in the United States is also named in his honor. It is held annually at Georgetown University the day before the annual March for Life.

It was designed to stimulate an interest in reading. The show was first transmitted on 13 December 1965, and the first story was the fairy-tale \\"Cap-o'-Rushes\\" read by Lee Montague. Jackanory continued to be broadcast until 1996, with around 3,500 episodes in its 30-year run. The final story, The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne, was read by Alan Bennett and broadcast on 24 March 1996. The show was briefly revived on 27 November 2006 for two one-off stories, and the format was revived as Jackanory Junior on CBeebies between 2007 and 2009. The show's format, which varied little over the decades, involved an actor reading from children's novels or folk tales, usually while seated in an armchair. From time to time the scene being read would be illustrated by a specially commissioned still drawing, often by Quentin Blake. Usually a single book would occupy five daily fifteen-minute episodes, from Monday to Friday. A spin-off series was Jackanory Playhouse (1972‚Äì85), which was a series of thirty-minute dramatisations. These included a dramatisation by Philip Glassborow of the comical A. A. Milne story \\"The Princess Who Couldn't Laugh\\". Title The show's title comes from an old English nursery rhyme: :I'll tell you a story :About Jack a Nory, :And now my story's begun; :I'll tell you another :Of Jack and his brother, :And now my story is done.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd ed., 1997), p. 233. The rhyme was first recorded in the publication The Top Book of All, for little Masters and Misses, which appeared about 1760. Revival The logo of the 2006 version. Image comes from the opening of The Magician of Samarkand In November 2006 Jackanory briefly returned with comedian John Sessions as the revived programme's first narrator reading the Lord of the Rings parody Muddle Earth, written by Paul Stewart (and illustrator Chris Riddell). The second narrator was Sir Ben Kingsley, reading The Magician of Samarkand by Alan Temperley. They were broadcast in three 15 minute slots on CBBC and BBC One and later repeated in their entirety on BBC One on consecutive Sundays. The readings of Muddle Earth were heavily accompanied by animation and featured John Sessions speaking the lines of all the animated characters (and occasionally reading those of Joe whenever he wasn't on-screen), leading to criticism that the spirit of the original programme, a single voice telling a tale with minimal distractions, had been lost. (The original series had occasionally included dramatised material, in e.g. 1984's Starstormers by Nicholas Fisk, and increasingly so towards the end of its run in the mid-1990s.) The Magician of Samarkand was a similar production, without additional actors speaking lines; Ben Kingsley read both the story and the lines of all the characters. Both of these stories were produced and directed by Nick Willing. Both stories were released on DVD in their entirety with added bonus features (galleries with images from the stories and a behind-the-scenes film for Muddle Earth). Jackanory Junior A version of Jackanory for younger children‚Äîcalled Jackanory Junior‚Äîwas shown on CBeebies between 2007 and 2009.

United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case upholding the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast Military Area during World War II. The decision has widely been criticized, with some scholars describing it as \\"an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry\\" and as \\"a stain on American jurisprudence\\". Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of Trump v. Hawaii that the Korematsu decision was explicitly repudiated. In the aftermath of Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded. Subsequently, the Western Defense Command, a United States Army military command charged with coordinating the defense of the West Coast of the United States, ordered \\"all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens\\" to relocate to internment camps. However, a 23-year-old Japanese-American man, Fred Korematsu, refused to leave the exclusion zone and instead challenged the order on the grounds that it violated the Fifth Amendment. In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the need to protect against espionage by Japan outweighed the rights of Americans of Japanese descent. Black wrote that: \\"Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race\\", but rather \\"because the properly constituted military authorities...decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast\\" during the war against Japan. Dissenting justices Frank Murphy, Robert H. Jackson, and Owen J. Roberts all criticized the exclusion as racially discriminatory; Murphy wrote that the exclusion of Japanese \\"falls into the ugly abyss of racism\\" and resembled \\"the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy.\\" The Korematsu opinion was the first instance in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard of review to racial discrimination by the government; it is one of only a handful of cases in which the Court held that the government met that standard. Korematsu's conviction was voided by a California district court in 1983 on the grounds that Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy had suppressed a report from the Office of Naval Intelligence that held that there was no evidence that Japanese Americans were acting as spies for Japan. The Japanese-Americans who were interned were later granted reparations through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Background Tanforan race track, San Bruno In the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the report of the First Roberts Commission, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded, and to provide for the necessary transport, lodging, and feeding of persons displaced from such areas. On March 2, 1942, the U.S. Army Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, issued Public Proclamation No. 1, demarcating western military areas and the exclusion zones therein, and directing any \\"Japanese, German, or Italian aliens\\" and any person of Japanese descent to inform the U.S. Postal Service of any changes of residence.Qtd. in Further military areas and zones were demarcated in Public Proclamation No. 2. In the meantime, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson mailed to Senator Robert Rice Reynolds and U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn draft legislation authorizing the enforcement of Executive Order 9066. By March 21, Congress had enacted the proposed legislation, which Roosevelt signed into law. Qtd. in On March 24, 1942, Western Defense Command began issuing Civilian Exclusion orders, commanding that \\"all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens\\" report to designated assembly points. With the issuance of Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1 on May 19, 1942, Japanese Americans were forced to move into relocation camps. Meanwhile, Fred Korematsu was a 23-year-old Japanese-American man who decided to stay at his residence in San Leandro, California, instead of obeying the order to relocate. However, he knowingly violated Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the U.S. Army, even undergoing plastic surgery in an attempt to conceal his identity. Korematsu argued that Executive Order 9066 was unconstitutional and that it violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment was selected over the Fourteenth Amendment due to the lack of federal protections in the Fourteenth Amendment. He was arrested and convicted. No question was raised as to Korematsu's loyalty to the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit eventually affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Decision =Black's majority opinion= Hugo Black The decision of the case, written by Justice Hugo Black, found the case largely indistinguishable from the previous year's Hirabayashi v. United States decision, and rested largely on the same principle: deference to Congress and the military authorities, particularly in light of the uncertainty following Pearl Harbor. Justice Black further denied that the case had anything to do with racial prejudice: > \\"Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to > him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese > Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an > invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security > measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation > demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West > Coast temporarily, and, finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence > in this time of war in our military leaders‚Äîas inevitably it must‚Äîdetermined > that they should have the power to do just this.\\" In his diaries, Justice Felix Frankfurter reported, that Justice Black told the justices as reason for deferring to the executive branch: ‚ÄúSomebody must run this war. It is either Roosevelt or us. And we cannot.‚ÄùStephen Breyer: America‚Äôs Courts Can‚Äôt Ignore the World. In: The Atlantic, September 2018 While Korematsu is regularly described as upholding the internment of Japanese Americans, the majority opinion expressly declined to reach the issue of internment on the ground that Korematsu's conviction did not present that issue, which it said raised different questions. The Court cross-referenced its decision the same day in Ex Parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), in which the Court ruled that a loyal Japanese American must be released from detention. =Frankfurter's concurrence= Justice Frankfurter's concurrence reads in its entirety: :\\"According to my reading of Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, it was an offense for Korematsu to be found in Military Area No. 1, the territory wherein he was previously living, except within the bounds of the established Assembly Center of that area. Even though the various orders issued by General DeWitt be deemed a comprehensive code of instructions, their tenor is clear, and not contradictory. They put upon Korematsu the obligation to leave Military Area No. 1, but only by the method prescribed in the instructions, i.e., by reporting to the Assembly Center. I am unable to see how the legal considerations that led to the decision in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, fail to sustain the military order which made the conduct now in controversy a crime. And so I join in the opinion of the Court, but should like to add a few words of my own. :The provisions of the Constitution which confer on the Congress and the President powers to enable this country to wage war are as much part of the Constitution as provisions looking to a nation at peace. And we have had recent occasion to quote approvingly the statement of former Chief Justice Hughes that the war power of the Government is \\"the power to wage war successfully\\". Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, at 93, and see Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 426. Therefore, the validity of action under the war power must be judged wholly in the context of war. That action is not to be stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless. To talk about a military order that expresses an allowable judgment of war needs by those entrusted with the duty of conducting war as \\"an [p. 225] unconstitutional order\\" is to suffuse a part of the Constitution with an atmosphere of unconstitutionality. The respective spheres of action of military authorities and of judges are, of course, very different. But, within their sphere, military authorities are no more outside the bounds of obedience to the Constitution than are judges within theirs. \\"The war power of the United States, like its other powers... is subject to applicable constitutional limitations\\", Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U.S. 146, 156. To recognize that military orders are \\"reasonably expedient military precautions\\" in time of war, and yet to deny them constitutional legitimacy, makes of the Constitution an instrument for dialectic subtleties not reasonably to be attributed to the hard-headed Framers, of whom a majority had had actual participation in war. If a military order such as that under review does not transcend the means appropriate for conducting war, such action by the military is as constitutional as would be any authorized action by the Interstate Commerce Commission within the limits of the constitutional power to regulate commerce. And, being an exercise of the war power explicitly granted by the Constitution for safeguarding the national life by prosecuting war effectively, I find nothing in the Constitution which denies to Congress the power to enforce such a valid military order by making its violation an offense triable in the civil courts. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447; 155 U.S. 3, and Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U.S. 177. To find that the Constitution does not forbid the military measures now complained of does not carry with it approval of that which Congress and the Executive did. That is their business, not ours.\\" =Murphy's dissent= U.S. Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy Justice Frank Murphy issued a vehement dissent, saying that the exclusion of Japanese \\"falls into the ugly abyss of racism\\", and resembles \\"the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy.\\" Murphy argued that collective punishment for Japanese Americans was an unconstitutional response to any disloyalty that might have been found in a minority of their cohort. He also compared the treatment of Japanese Americans with the treatment of Americans of German and Italian ancestry, as evidence that race, and not emergency alone, led to the exclusion order which Korematsu was convicted of violating: > \\"I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial > discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part > whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in any setting, > but it is utterly revolting among a free people who have embraced the > principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States. All residents > of this nation are kin in some way by blood or culture to a foreign land. > Yet they are primarily and necessarily a part of the new and distinct > civilization of the United States. They must, accordingly, be treated at all > times as the heirs of the American experiment, and as entitled to all the > rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\\" Justice Murphy's two uses of the term \\"racism\\" in this opinion, along with two additional uses in his concurrence in Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railway Co., decided the same day, are among the first appearances of the word \\"racism\\" in a United States Supreme Court opinion. The first appearance was in Justice Murphy's concurrence in . The term was also used in other cases, such as and . It then disappeared from the court's lexicon for 18 years‚Äîit reappeared in . It did not appear in , even though that case did talk about racial discrimination and interracial marriages. =Roberts's dissent= Justice Roberts's dissent also acknowledges the racism inherent in the case although he does not use the word. He recognized that the defendant was being punished based solely upon his ancestry: > \\"This is not a case of keeping people off the streets at night, as was > Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, [p. 226] nor a case of temporary > exclusion of a citizen from an area for his own safety or that of the > community, nor a case of offering him an opportunity to go temporarily out > of an area where his presence might cause danger to himself or to his > fellows. On the contrary, it is the case of convicting a citizen as a > punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based > on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or > inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United > States. If this be a correct statement of the facts disclosed by this > record, and facts of which we take judicial notice, I need hardly labor the > conclusion that Constitutional rights have been violated.\\" =Jackson's dissent= By contrast, Justice Robert Jackson's dissent argued that \\"defense measures will not, and often should not, be held within the limits that bind civil authority in peace\\", and that it would perhaps be unreasonable to hold the military, who issued the exclusion order, to the same standards of constitutionality that apply to the rest of the government. \\"In the very nature of things\\", he wrote, \\"military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal.\\" He acknowledged the Court's powerlessness in that regard, writing that \\"courts can never have any real alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint.\\" He nonetheless dissented, writing that, even if the courts should not be put in the position of second- guessing or interfering with the orders of military commanders, that does not mean that they should have to ratify or enforce those orders if they are unconstitutional. Jackson writes, \\"I do not think [the civil courts] may be asked to execute a military expedient that has no place in law under the Constitution. I would reverse the judgment and discharge the prisoner.\\" Indeed, he warns that the precedent of Korematsu might last well beyond the war and the internment: > \\"A military order, however unconstitutional, is not apt to last longer than > the military emergency. Even during that period, a succeeding commander may > revoke it all. But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to > show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the > Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the > Court for all time has validated the principle of racial discrimination in > criminal procedure and of transplanting American citizens. The principle > then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority > that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition > imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to > new purposes.\\" Jackson further warned: > \\"Of course the existence of a military power resting on force, so vagrant, > so centralized, so necessarily heedless of the individual, is an inherent > threat to liberty. But I would not lead people to rely on this Court for a > review that seems to me wholly delusive. The military reasonableness of > these orders can only be determined by military superiors. If the people > ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous > hands, the courts wield no power equal to its restraint.

Subsequent history =Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians= In 1980, Congress established a commission to evaluate the events leading up to the issuance of Executive Order 9066 and accompanying military directives and their impact on citizens and resident aliens, charging the commission with recommending remedies. Discussing the Korematsu decision in their 1982 report entitled Personal Justice Denied, this Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CCWRIC) concluded that \\"each part of the decision, questions of both factual review and legal principles, has been discredited or abandoned,\\" and that, \\"Today the decision in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history.\\" =Conviction overturned= Korematsu challenged his conviction in 1983 by filing before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a writ of coram nobis, which asserted that the original conviction was so flawed as to represent a grave injustice that should be reversed. As evidence, he submitted the conclusions of the CCWRIC report as well as newly- discovered internal Justice Department communications demonstrating that evidence contradicting the military necessity for the Executive Order 9066 had been knowingly withheld from the Supreme Court. Specifically, he said Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy had kept from the Court a wartime finding by the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Ringle Report, that concluded very few Japanese represented a risk and that almost all of those who did were already in custody when the Executive Order was enacted. While not admitting error, the government submitted a counter-motion asking the court to vacate the conviction without a finding of fact on its merits. Judge Marilyn Hall Patel denied the government's petition, and concluded that the Supreme Court had indeed been given a selective record, representing a compelling circumstance sufficient to overturn the original conviction. She granted the writ, thereby voiding Korematsu's conviction, while pointing out that since this decision was based on prosecutorial misconduct and not an error of law, any legal precedent established by the case remained in force. =2011 DOJ admission of error= On May 20, 2011, Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal released an unusual statement denouncing one of his predecessors, Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy. He faulted Fahy for having \\"suppressed critical evidence\\" in the Hirabayashi and Korematsu cases before the Supreme Court during World War II, specifically the Ringle Report's conclusion that there was no indication Japanese Americans were acting as spies or sending signals to enemy submarines. The rulings in the 1980s that overturned the convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi concluded that failure to disclose the Ringle Report, along with an initial report by General De Witt that demonstrated racist motivations behind the military orders, represented a fatal flaw in the prosecution of their cases before the Supreme Court. Katyal noted that Justice Department attorneys had actually alerted Fahy that failing to disclose the Ringle Report's existence in the briefs or argument in the Supreme Court, \\"might approximate the suppression of evidence\\". Thus, Katyal concluded that Mr. Fahy \\"did not inform the Court that a key set of allegations used to justify the internment\\" had been doubted, if not fully discredited, within the government's own agencies. Katyal therefore announced his office's filing of a formal \\"admission of error\\". He reaffirmed the extraordinary duty of the Solicitor General to address the Court with \\"absolute candor,\\" due to the \\"special credence\\" the Court explicitly grants to his court submissions. =21st century reactions= Fred Korematsu Eleven lawyers who had represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter dated January 13, 2014, to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. In light of the appeal proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court in Hedges v. Obama, the lawyers asked Verrilli to ask the Supreme Court to overrule its decisions in Korematsu, Hirabayashi (1943) and Yasui (1943). If the Solicitor General shouldn't do this, they asked that the United States government to \\"make clear\\" that the federal government \\"does not consider the internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of individuals or groups without due process of law [...].\\" On February 3, 2014, Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion with law students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa William S. Richardson School of Law, said that \\"the Supreme Court's Korematsu decision upholding the internment of Japanese Americans was wrong, but it could happen again in war time.\\" In October 2015 at Santa Clara University, Scalia told law students that Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion in Korematsu was the past court opinion he admired most, adding \\"It was nice to know that at least somebody on the court realized that that was wrong.\\" Donald Trump's Presidential election led Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to advocate for Trump to implement immigration controls like the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. One Trump supporter, Carl Higbie, said that Jimmy Carter's 1980 restriction on Iranian immigration, as well as the Korematsu decision, gives legal precedent for a registry of immigrants. Critics of Higbie argued that Korematsu should not be referenced as precedent. Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein argued that the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 granting reparations to the Japanese Americans who were interned amounts to Korematsu having been overturned by history‚Äîoutside of a potential formal Supreme Court overrule. Another critic of Higbie described Korematsu as a \\"stain on American jurisprudence\\". According to Harvard University's Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, \\"a decision can be wrong at the very moment it was decided‚Äîand therefore should not be followed subsequently.\\" Justice Anthony Kennedy applied this approach in Lawrence v. Texas to overturn Bowers v. Hardwick and thereby strike down anti-sodomy laws in 14 states. The implication is that decisions which are wrong when decided should not be followed even before the Court reverses itself, and Korematsu has probably the greatest claim to being wrong when decided of any case which still stood. Legal scholar Richard Primus applied the term \\"Anti-Canon\\" to cases which are \\"universally assailed as wrong, immoral, and unconstitutional\\" and have become exemplars of faulty legal reasoning. Plessy v. Ferguson is one such example, and Korematsu has joined this group‚Äîas Feldman then put it, \\"Korematsu's uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned.\\" = Rejection in Trump v. Hawaii = Chief Justice Roberts, in writing the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii, stated in obiter dictum that Korematsu v. United States was wrongly decided, essentially disavowing the decision and indicating that a majority of the court no longer finds Korematsu persuasive. Quoting Justice Robert H. Jackson's dissent from Korematsu, the Chief Justice stated: Roberts also added: \\"The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority.\\" See also * Anticanon * Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians * Ex parte Endo * Hirabayashi v.

He served as Archbishop of New York from 1968 until his death, quietly battling leukemia throughout his tenure. He was named a cardinal in 1969. Nine years after his death, he was designated a Servant of God, the first step in the process that leads to beatification and then canonization as a saint. Early life and education The youngest of three children, Terence Cooke was born in New York City to Michael and Margaret (n√©e Gannon) Cooke. His parents were both from County Galway, Ireland, and named their son after Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork who died on a hunger strike during the Irish War of Independence. Michael Cooke worked as a chauffeur and construction worker. At age five, Terence and his family moved from Morningside Heights, Manhattan, to the northeast Bronx. Following his mother's death in 1930, his aunt Mary Gannon helped raise him and his siblings. After expressing an early interest in the priesthood, in 1934 Cooke entered Manhattan's Cathedral College, the minor seminary of the Archdiocese of New York. In 1940, he entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Ministry Cooke was ordained a priest by Archbishop Francis Spellman on December 1, 1945. Cooke then served as chaplain for St. Agatha's Home for Children in Nanuet until 1947, when he moved to Washington, D.C., to pursue graduate studies at The Catholic University of America. He obtained a Master of Social Work degree in 1949. When he returned to New York, Cooke was assigned to serve as a curate at St. Athanasius Parish in the Bronx, while also teaching at Fordham University's School of Social Service and working with the Catholic Youth Organization. In 1954 he was appointed Executive Director of the Youth Division of Catholic Charities and procurator of St. Joseph's Seminary. In 1957 he was appointed by Cardinal Spellman to be his secretary, a position he held until 1965. Cooke was named a Monsignor on August 13, 1957, and Vice-Chancellor for the Archdiocese in 1958, rising to full Chancellor in 1961. Auxiliary Bishop On September 15, 1965, Pope Paul VI appointed Cooke as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and titular bishop of Summa. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 13 from Cardinal Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Archbishops Joseph Thomas McGucken and John Joseph Maguire serving as co-consecrators. Cooke selected as his episcopal motto: Fiat Voluntas Tua, meaning, \\"Thy Will Be Done\\" (). Cooke played a prominent role in arranging Pope Paul's visit to New York in October, and became Vicar General of the Archdiocese two days after his consecration, on December 15, 1965. He was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, a form of cancer, that year as well. Archbishop of New York Following the death of Spellman in December 1967, Cooke was named the seventh Archbishop of New York on March 2, 1968. Pope Paul's selection of Cooke came as a surprise; likely contenders for the post included Fulton J. Sheen, a television personality and Bishop of Rochester; and Archbishop Maguire, who had been Spellman's coadjutor but did not hold the right to succession. In addition to his duties in New York, Cooke was named Vicar Apostolic for the U.S. Military on April 4, and was installed in both positions at St. Patrick's Cathedral. That same day, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, leading to a nationwide wave of riots in more than 100 cities. Cooke went to Harlem that evening to plead for racial peace and later attended King's funeral. After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Cooke led the funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral and later baptized Kennedy's youngest child, Rory Kennedy. In 1969, Cooke delivered the benediction at the inauguration of President Richard Nixon. Cooke helped implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the Archdiocese, and adopted a more collegial management style than his predecessor Spellman. Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome (the traditional titular church of the New York archbishops starting in 1946) in the consistory of April 28, 1969. At the time of his elevation, he was the second-youngest member of the College of Cardinals after Alfred Bengsch, who was six months younger. Cooke was theologically conservative but progressive in secular matters. During his tenure as archbishop, Cooke founded Birthright, which offers women alternatives to abortion; the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, which provides financial aid for Catholic-school students; an Archdiocesan Housing Development Program, providing housing to New York's disadvantaged; Catholic New York, the archdiocesan newspaper; and nine nursing homes. In 1974, he went to the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he attended lectures on the Second Vatican Council given by his future successor Edward Egan. Cooke was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. In 1979, Cooke separately hosted the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Illness and death Cooke's leukemia, first diagnosed in 1965, was deemed terminal in 1975, and he was on almost constant chemotherapy for the last five years of his life. In late August 1983, he announced his illness to the public, saying that he was expected to live for a few more months but would not resign his post. In an open letter completed only days before his death, he wrote, \\"The gift of life, God's special gift, is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by illness or weakness, hunger or poverty, mental or physical handicaps, loneliness or old age.\\" On October 6, 1983, Cooke died from leukemia at age 62 at his episcopal residence in Manhattan, New York City. He is interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Views *Relations with the Soviet Union: An anti-Communist, he opposed the majority of his fellow bishops when he spoke out against nuclear disarmament in 1982. He once stated that deterrence was not satisfactory or safe, but could be considered morally \\"tolerable\\". *Abortion: He was an outspoken opponent of abortion, which he called the \\"slaughter of the innocent unborn\\", and once served as chairman of the U.S. Bishops' Pro-Life Committee. *Homosexuality: He initiated the formation of Courage International, a ministry that promotes chastity and support for gay and lesbian Catholics. *Church movements: Cooke supported the Cursillo Movement, Christian Family Movement, and Charismatic Renewal, and was instrumental in bringing the Missionaries of Charity to New York. *Irish Republican Army: Cooke, opposed to the militant policies of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, remained inside St. Patrick's Cathedral during the 1983 St. Patrick's Day Parade, until the grand marshal, Michael Flannery, had passed by. Flannery was an outspoken supporter of the IRA.Byrne, James, Philip Coleman, and Jason King. Ireland and the Americas: Culture, Politics and History. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2008. 826. Print. *Grace Kelly: Cooke once described Grace Kelly as \\"a lesson in Catholic motherhood\\". Cause for canonization Cooke was regarded as a holy person by many New Yorkers during his ministry as archbishop. Soon after his death in 1983, a movement emerged to canonize him as a saint. In 1984, with the support of Cooke's successor, Archbishop (and future cardinal) John Joseph O'Connor, the Cardinal Cooke Guild was established. In 1992, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints officially designated Cooke as a Servant of God, the first step in the process that leads to beatification and then canonization as a saint. On April 14, 2010, the Guild and senior American clergy presented Pope Benedict XVI with the positio, the documentation of the cardinal's life, work and virtues. The document was then filed with the Congregation for Causes, to be examined by theologians. If the document is approved, Cardinal Cooke will receive the title of Venerable, the second step leading to sainthood. The Reverend Benedict Groeschel, C.F.R., was the postulator for the cause while it was in its initial stages in New York. Since the process was accepted by the Holy See, Andrea Ambrosi, J.D., has served in that position. Other recognitions On April 5, 1984, President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Cooke the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Presidential Medal of Freedom, The White House, p. 52. In 1988, he posthumously received the F. Sadlier Dinger Award from the publisher William H. Sadlier, Inc., for his contributions to religious education.The F. Sadlier Dinger Award, William H. Sadlier, Inc. During his years as Archbishop, Cooke received honorary degrees from at least four Catholic colleges: College of New Rochelle (1968),Honorary Degree Recipients, College of New Rochelle.

Boston College (1969),Honorary Degrees Awarded, Boston College. and Marymount Manhattan College (1978).Honorary Degree Recipients, Marymount Manhattan College.

(AGSM), is a private nonprofit organization of American mothers who lost sons or daughters in service of the United States Armed Forces. It was originally formed in 1928 for mothers of those lost in World War I, and it holds a congressional charter under Title 36 ¬ß 211 of the United States Code. Its name came from the custom of families of servicemen hanging a banner called a service flag in the windows of their homes. The service flag had a star for each family member in the Armed Forces. Living servicemen were represented by a blue star, and those who had lost their lives in combat were represented by a gold star. Membership in the organization is open to any woman who is a U.S. citizen or legal resident that has lost a son or daughter in active service in the U.S. military (regardless of the place or time of the military service, regardless of whether the circumstances of death involved hostile conflict or not, and including mothers of those missing in action). Founding The Gold Star Mothers was founded by Grace Darling Seibold of Washington, D.C. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, George Vaughn Seibold, 23, volunteered, requesting assignment in aviation. He was sent to Canada where he learned to fly British planes since the United States had neither an air force nor planes. Deployed to England, he was assigned to the British Royal Flying Corps with 148th Aero Squadron. With his squadron, he left for combat duty in France. He corresponded with his family regularly. His mother, Grace Darling Seibold, began to do community service by visiting returning servicemen in the hospitals. re The mail from George stopped. Since all aviators were under British control and authority, the United States could not help the Seibold family with any information about their son. Grace continued to visit hospitalized veterans in the Washington area, clinging to the hope that her son might have been injured and returned to the United States without any identification. While working through her sorrow, she helped ease the pain of the many servicemen who returned so war-damaged that they were incapable of ever reaching normalcy. But on October 11, 1918, George's wife in Chicago received a box marked \\"Effects of deceased Officer 1st Lt. George Vaughn Seibold\\". The Seibolds also received a confirmation of George's death on November 4 through a family member in Paris. George's body was never identified. Grace, convinced that self-contained grief is self-destructive, devoted her time and efforts not only to working in the hospital but also to supporting other mothers whose sons had lost their lives in military service. She organized a group consisting solely of these mothers, with the purpose of not only comforting each other, but giving loving care to hospitalized veterans confined in government hospitals far from home. The organization was named after the Gold Star that families hung in their windows in honor of the deceased veteran. After years of planning, twenty-five mothers met in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 1928, to establish the national organization, American Gold Star Mothers, Inc.  Origin of Gold Star Symbol  On May 28, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson approved a suggestion made by the Council of National Defense that, instead of wearing conventional mourning for relatives who have died in the service of their country, American women should wear a black band on the left arm with a gilt star on the band for each member of the family who has given his life for the nation. \\"The Service Flag displayed from homes, places of business, churches, schools, etc., to indicate the number of members of the family or organizations who are serving in the Armed Forces or who have died from such service. Service flags have a deep Blue Star for each living member in the service and a Gold Star for each member who has died.\\" Thus, the Gold Star and the term Gold Star Mother, as applied to mothers whose sons or daughters died in World War I, were accepted; they have continued to be used in reference to all American military engagements since that time. History of membership criteria Membership in American Gold Star Mothers was originally restricted to those who lost sons or daughters in World War I, and was later expanded to include mothers of those lost in World War II, then the Korean War, and then other specific conflicts. Today, the membership criteria do not consider the place or time of the military service and do not consider whether the circumstances of the death involved hostile conflict or not, and also allow membership for mothers of those missing in action. For the first 77 years of its existence, AGSM restricted its membership criteria to admit only U.S. citizens. As a way to create pressure to change the rule, an application for admission was submitted in 2005 that deliberately highlighted the applicant's lack of citizenship. The application, from Ligaya Lagman, a Filipino permanent resident of the United States living in Yonkers, New York, who had been living in the U.S. more than 20 years and whose son, Marine Staff Sgt. Anthony Lagman, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2004 at the age of 26, was rejected in May 2005. In the next month after that incident, which received a \\"firestorm\\" of publicity that included negative commentary by New York U.S. Representative Eliot Engel and New York U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the group agreed on June 27, 2005, to change its membership criteria, and it accepted its first two non-citizens as members a few months later in early September 2005. Current membership and charter Gold Star Mothers listen as Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley (not pictured) offers remarks during the 80th Gold Star Mother's Day commemorative ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., Sept. 25, 2016. The AGSM is a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that sets its own rules for who is allowed to become a member. The current charter, held under Title 36 ¬ß 211 of the United States Code, was established on June 12, 1984. Today, membership in American Gold Star Mothers is open to any woman who was a U.S. citizen or legal resident of the U.S. or its Territories or Insular Possessions at the time their child (or adopted child) was inducted into military service and whose child (or adopted child) has died or has become missing in action while in the United States Armed Forces (or died later as the result of such service). Membership is not contingent on whether the child was killed in action or on the theater of operation or the time period of the service (which differs from distinctions made by the Department of Defense, which confers special status to service in particular periods of time and particular hostile operations). Non-adoptive stepmothers are also eligible for membership if they assumed responsibility for the child before the age of fifteen and raised them. Husbands and children of Gold Star Mothers are eligible to join as Associate Members. Honorary membership is available to mothers who were not citizens or legal residents at the time their child was inducted. Associate Members and Honorary Members cannot vote or hold official positions (and are not required to pay dues). AGSM is made up of local chapters, which are organized into departments. Five members are required to start a local chapter. If no local chapter is available, a woman may join the organization as a member at large. Just as when it was founded, AGSM continues to concentrate on providing emotional support to its members, doing volunteer work with veterans in general and veterans' hospitals in particular, and generally fostering a sense of patriotism and respect for members of the Armed Forces. Uniform The uniform consists of a white skirt, white shirt, and a white blazer, with a gold star embroidered on either lapel, and gold piping on the sleeve cuffs, and collars, and white shoes, either Mary Janes or pumps, with a white cap, similar to a women's service hat, with gold piping. This uniform is worn at all parades, meetings, and social functions connected with military functions (e.g., Memorial Day services at Arlington National Cemetery) Notable memberships Gold Star Mothers commemorative issue of 1948 Aside from the founder, perhaps the mother most known for being a Gold Star mother was Aletta Sullivan, the mother of the five Sullivan brothers, who were killed in action when their ship, the was sunk by an enemy torpedo on November 13, 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. On September 21, 1948, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp, specially designed by artist Charles R. Chickering, honoring the Gold Star Mothers. Mrs. Sullivan was given the first sheet of stamps issued. Gold Star Mother's Day On the last Sunday in September, Gold Star Mother's Day is observed in the U.S. in honor of Gold Star mothers, as established in Title 36 ¬ß 111 of the United States Code. This was originally declared by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936. In September 2012, Barack Obama issued a presidential proclamation commemorating September 30, 2012, as \\"Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day\\". On September 23, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day.

A mesocyclone is storm-scale region of rotation (vortex), typically around in diameter, within a thunderstorm. In the northern hemisphere it is particularly found in the right rear flank of a supercell or often on the eastern, or front, flank of an HP storm. The circulation of a mesocyclone covers an area much larger than the tornado that may develop within it.. Mesocyclones are detectable on Doppler weather radar as a rotation signature which meets specific criteria for magnitude, vertical depth, and duration. On US NEXRAD radars displays, they will be highlighted by a yellow solid circle on the Doppler velocity products but other countries may have other conventions. Therefore, a mesocyclone should not be considered a visually-observable phenomenon; although visual evidence of rotation, such as curved inflow bands, may imply the presence of a mesocyclone.  Formation  Mesocyclones form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height (\\"wind shear\\") sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a thunderstorm then draw up this spinning air, tilting the rolls' orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.University of Illinois. Vertical Wind Shear Retrieved on 2006-10-21. As the updraft rotates and ingests cooler moister air from the forward flank downdraft (FFD), it may form a wall cloud, a spinning layer of clouds lowered from ambient storm cloud base under the mid-level mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone. As it descends, a funnel cloud may form near its center. This is the first visible stage of tornadogenesis. The gallery below shows the 3 stages of development of a mesocyclone and a view of the storm relative motion on radar of a mesocyclone-producing tornado over Greensburg, Kansas on May 4, 2007.

Identification The best way to detect and verify the presence of a mesocyclone is by Doppler weather radar. Nearby high values of opposite sign within velocity data are how they are detected. Mesocyclones are most often identified in the right-rear flank of supercell thunderstorms and squall lines, and may be distinguished by a hook echo rotation signature on a weather radar map. Visual cues such as a rotating wall cloud or tornado may also hint at the presence of a mesocyclone. This is why the term has entered into wider usage in connection with rotating features in severe storms. File:Wall cloud with lightning - NOAA.jpgMesocyclones are sometimes visually identifiable by a rotating wall cloud like the one in this thunderstorm over Texas.

Tornado formation  A tornado near Anadarko, Oklahoma Tornado formation is not completely understood, but often occurs in one of two ways. In the first method, two conditions must be satisfied. One, a horizontal spinning effect must form on the Earth's surface. This usually originates in sudden changes in wind direction or speed, known as wind shear. Two, a thundercloud, or occasionally a cumulus cloud, must be present. During a thunderstorm, updrafts are occasionally powerful enough to lift the horizontal spinning row of air upwards, turning it into a vertical air column. This vertical air column then becomes the basic structure for the tornado. Tornadoes that form in this way are often weak and generally last less than 10 minutes. The second method occurs during a supercell thunderstorm, in updrafts within the storm. When winds intensify, the force released can cause the updrafts to rotate. This rotating updraft is known as a mesocyclone. For a tornado to form in this manner, a rear-flank downdraft enters the center of the mesocyclone from the back. Cold air, being denser than warm air, is able to penetrate the updraft. The combination of the updraft and downdraft completes the development of a tornado. Tornadoes that form in this method are often violent and can last over an hour. Mesoscale convective vortex A mesoscale convective vortex (MCV), also known as a mesoscale vorticity center or Neddy eddy, is a mesocyclone within a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that pulls winds into a circling pattern, or vortex, at the mid levels of the troposphere and is normally associated with anticyclonic outflow aloft. With a core only wide and deep, an MCV is often overlooked in standard weather maps. MCVs can persist for up to two days after its parent mesoscale convective system has dissipated. The orphaned MCV can become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak. An MCV that moves into tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane. MCVs can produce very large wind storms; sometimes winds can reach over . The May 2009 Southern Midwest Derecho was an extreme progressive derecho and mesoscale convective vortex event that struck southeastern Kansas, southern Missouri, and southwestern Illinois on May 8, 2009.

The scalar multiplications ‚àía and 2a of a vector a In mathematics, scalar multiplication is one of the basic operations defining a vector space in linear algebra (or more generally, a module in abstract algebra). In common geometrical contexts, scalar multiplication of a real Euclidean vector by a positive real number multiplies the magnitude of the vector‚Äîwithout changing its direction. The term \\"scalar\\" itself derives from this usage: a scalar is that which scales vectors. Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar (where the product is a vector), and is to be distinguished from inner product of two vectors (where the product is a scalar). Definition In general, if K is a field and V is a vector space over K, then scalar multiplication is a function from K √ó V to V. The result of applying this function to k in K and v in V is denoted kv. =Properties= Scalar multiplication obeys the following rules (vector in boldface): * Additivity in the scalar: (c + d)v = cv + dv; * Additivity in the vector: c(v + w) = cv + cw; * Compatibility of product of scalars with scalar multiplication: (cd)v = c(dv); * Multiplying by 1 does not change a vector: 1v = v; * Multiplying by 0 gives the zero vector: 0v = 0; * Multiplying by ‚àí1 gives the additive inverse: (‚àí1)v = ‚àív. Here, + is addition either in the field or in the vector space, as appropriate; and 0 is the additive identity in either. Juxtaposition indicates either scalar multiplication or the multiplication operation in the field. Interpretation Scalar multiplication may be viewed as an external binary operation or as an action of the field on the vector space. A geometric interpretation of scalar multiplication is that it stretches, or contracts, vectors by a constant factor. As a result, it produces a vector in the same or opposite direction of the original vector but of a different length. As a special case, V may be taken to be K itself and scalar multiplication may then be taken to be simply the multiplication in the field. When V is Kn, scalar multiplication is equivalent to multiplication of each component with the scalar, and may be defined as such. The same idea applies if K is a commutative ring and V is a module over K. K can even be a rig, but then there is no additive inverse. If K is not commutative, the distinct operations left scalar multiplication cv and right scalar multiplication vc may be defined.  Scalar multiplication of matrices  The left scalar multiplication of a matrix with a scalar gives another matrix of the same size as . It is denoted by , whose entries of are defined by : (\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{A})_{ij} = \\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right)_{ij}\\\\,, explicitly: : \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\lambda \\\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} & \\\\cdots & A_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} & \\\\cdots & A_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{n1} & A_{n2} & \\\\cdots & A_{nm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda A_{11} & \\\\lambda A_{12} & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda A_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda A_{21} & \\\\lambda A_{22} & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda A_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda A_{n1} & \\\\lambda A_{n2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda A_{nm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,. Similarly, the right scalar multiplication of a matrix with a scalar is defined to be : (\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\lambda)_{ij} = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right)_{ij} \\\\lambda\\\\,, explicitly: : \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\lambda = \\\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} & \\\\cdots & A_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} & \\\\cdots & A_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{n1} & A_{n2} & \\\\cdots & A_{nm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\lambda = \\\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} \\\\lambda & A_{12} \\\\lambda & \\\\cdots & A_{1m} \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} \\\\lambda & A_{22} \\\\lambda & \\\\cdots & A_{2m} \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{n1} \\\\lambda & A_{n2} \\\\lambda & \\\\cdots & A_{nm} \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,. When the underlying ring is commutative, for example, the real or complex number field, these two multiplications are the same, and are simply called scalar multiplication. However, for matrices over a more general ring that are not commutative, such as the quaternions, they may not be equal. For a real scalar and matrix: : \\\\lambda = 2, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{A} =\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} : 2 \\\\mathbf{A} = 2 \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! a & 2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! b \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! c & 2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! 2 & b \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! 2 & d \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}2= \\\\mathbf{A}2. For quaternion scalars and matrices: : \\\\lambda = i, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} : i\\\\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} i^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & ij \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} e \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} i^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & ji \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}i\\\\,, where are the quaternion units.

They are usually associated with active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow. Squalls refer to the increase to the sustained winds over that time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event. They usually occur in a region of strong sinking air or cooling in the mid-atmosphere. These force strong localized upward motions at the leading edge of the region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.

Character of the wind The term \\"squall\\" is used to refer to a sudden wind-speed increase lasting minutes. In 1962 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defined that to be classified as a \\"squall\\", the wind must increase at least 8 m/s and must attain a top speed of at least 11 m/s, lasting at least one minute in duration. In Australia, a squall is defined to last for several minutes before the wind returns to the long term mean value. In either case, a squall is defined to last about half as long as the definition of sustained wind in its respective country. Usually, this sudden violent wind is associated with briefly heavy precipitation as squall line.

Severe weather A shelf cloud such as this one can be a sign that a squall is imminent A squall line is an organized line of thunderstorms. It is classified as a multi-cell cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called multi-cell lines. Squalls are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, but they can also occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel clouds, tornadoes and waterspouts.Weatherquestions.com.

Retrieved on 2006-11-19. =Squall line life cycle= There are several forms of mesoscale meteorology, including simplistic isolated thunderstorms unrelated to advancing cold fronts, to the more complex daytime/nocturnal Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) and Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC), to squall line thunderstorms. Formation The main driving force behind squall line creation is attributed to the process of in- filling of multiple thunderstorms and/or a single area of thunderstorms expanding outward within the leading space of an advancing cold front. =Pressure perturbations= Pressure perturbations within an extent of a thunderstorm are noteworthy. With buoyancy rapid within the lower and mid- levels of a mature thunderstorm, one might believe that low pressure dominates in the mesoscale environment. However, this is not the case. With downdrafts ushering colder air from mid-levels, hitting ground and propagating away in all directions, high pressure is to be found widely at surface levels, usually indicative of strong (potentially damaging) winds. =Wind shear= A summer squall line in Southern Ontario, producing lightning and distant heavy rains. Wind shear is an important aspect to measuring the potential of squall line severity and duration. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to turn will aid in create a leading edge lifting mechanism ‚Äì the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes. Evolution =Updrafts= The leading area of a squall line is composed primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important. As thunderstorms fill into a distinct line, strong leading-edge updrafts ‚Äì occasionally visible to a ground observer in the form of a shelf cloud ‚Äì may appear as an ominous sign of potential severe weather. Beyond the strong winds because of updraft/downdraft behavior, heavy rain (and hail) is another sign of a squall line. In the winter, squall lines can occur albeit less frequently ‚Äì bringing heavy snow and/or thunder and lightning ‚Äì usually over inland lakes (i.e. Great Lakes region). =Bow echoes= Following the initial passage of a squall line, light to moderate stratiform precipitation is also common. A bow echo is frequently seen on the northern and southernmost reaches of squall line thunderstorms (via satellite imagery). This is where the northern and southern ends curl backwards towards the middle portions of the squall line, making a \\"bow\\" shape. Bow echoes are frequently featured within supercell mesoscale systems. =Mesolow= A wake low is a mesolow The northern end of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end, with the southern side rotating anticyclonically. Because of the coriolis force, the northern end may evolve further, creating a \\"comma shaped\\" mesolow, or may continue in a squall-like pattern. A wake low is another kind of mesoscale low-pressure area to the rear of a squall line near the back edge of the stratiform rain area.. Due to the subsiding warm air associated with the system's formation, clearing skies are associated with the wake low. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough.. When the squall line is in the process of decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem. Dissipation As supercells and multi-cell thunderstorms dissipate due to a weak shear force or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the squall line or gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale area of low pressure may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper-level low filling) leading to frontolysis. From here, a general thinning of a squall line will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness. =Signs in the sky= Shelf clouds and roll clouds are usually seen above the leading edge of a squall, also known as a thunderstorm's gust front.National Weather Service Forecast Office, Springfield, Missouri. Storm Spotter Online Training. Retrieved on 2006-11-19. From the time these low cloud features appear in the sky, one can expect a sudden increase in the wind in less than 15 minutes. Tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones normally have squalls coincident with spiral bands of greater curvature than many mid-latitude systems due to their smaller size. These squalls can harbor waterspouts and tornadoes due to the significant vertical wind shear which exists in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone's outer bands. Winter weather Snow squalls can be spawned by an intrusion of cold air aloft over a relatively warm surface layer. Lake effect snows can be in the form of a snow squall.

It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may also occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by having a timescale of fewer than six hours between rainfall and the onset of flooding. The water that is temporarily available is sometimes used by certain plants for growth. However, plants that thrive in drier areas can be harmed by flooding, as the plants can become stressed by the large amount of water.  Causes  Flash floods can occur under several types of conditions. Flash flooding occurs when it rains rapidly on saturated soil or dry soil that has poor absorption ability. The runoff collects in gullies and streams and, as they join to form larger volumes, often form a fast flowing front of water and debris. Flash floods most often occur in dry areas that have recently received precipitation, but they may be seen anywhere downstream from the source of the precipitation, even many miles from the source. In areas on or near volcanoes, flash floods have also occurred after eruptions, when glaciers have been melted by the intense heat. Flash floods are known to occur in the highest mountain ranges of the United States and are also common in the arid plains of the Southwestern United States. Flash flooding can also be caused by extensive rainfall released by hurricanes and other tropical storms, as well as the sudden thawing effect of ice dams. Human activities can also cause flash floods to occur. When dams fail, a large quantity of water can be released and destroy everything in its path.  Hazards  A flash flood greatly inundates a small ditch, flooding barns and ripping out newly installed drain pipes. The United States National Weather Service gives the advice \\"Turn Around, Don't Drown\\" for flash floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood, rather than trying to cross it. Many people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods. What makes flash floods most dangerous is their sudden nature and fast-moving water. A vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away; it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood. More than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded intersections. As little as of water is enough to carry away most SUV-sized vehicles. The U.S. National Weather Service reported in 2005 that, using a national 30-year average, more people die yearly in floods, 127 on average, than by lightning (73), tornadoes (65), or hurricanes (16). In deserts, flash floods can be particularly deadly for several reasons. First, storms in arid regions are infrequent, but they can deliver an enormous amount of water in a very short time. Second, these rains often fall on poorly absorbent and often clay-like soil, which greatly increases the amount of runoff that rivers and other water channels have to handle. These regions tend not to have the infrastructure that wetter regions have to divert water from structures and roads, such as storm drains, culverts, and retention basins, either because of sparse population or poverty, or because residents believe the risk of flash floods is not high enough to justify the expense. In fact, in some areas, desert roads frequently cross a dry river and creek beds without bridges. From the driver's perspective, there may be clear weather, when a river unexpectedly forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of seconds. Finally, the lack of regular rain to clear water channels may cause flash floods in deserts to be headed by large amounts of debris, such as rocks, branches, and logs. Deep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away. The flood sweeps through the canyon; the canyon makes it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the flood.  Flash flood impacts  Flash floods induce severe impacts in both the built and the natural environment. Especially within urban areas, the effects of flash floods can be catastrophic and show extensive diversity, ranging from damages in buildings and infrastructure to impacts on vegetation, human lives and livestock. An impact severity scale is proposed in 2020 providing a coherent overview of the flash flood effects through the classification of impact types and severity and mapping their spatial extent in a continuous way across the floodplain. Depending on the affected elements, the flood effects are grouped into 4 categories: (i) impacts on built environment (ii) impacts on man-made mobile objects,(iii) impacts on the natural environment (including vegetation, agriculture, geomorphology, and pollution) and (iv) impacts on the human population (entrapments, injuries, fatalities). The scale was proposed as a tool on prevention planning, as the resulting maps offer insights on future impacts, highlighting the high severity areas.

The precise origins of the group and the term are unclear, though it may be that they began as a limited political movement in opposition to the elite (patricians) which became more widely applied and known as the conflict of orders.See for example For more on how plebeians fit into social classes in ancient Rome, see Social class in ancient Rome.  In ancient Rome  In Latin, the word is a singular collective noun, and its genitive is . Plebeians were not a monolithic social class. Those who resided in the city and were part of the 4 urban tribes are sometimes called the , while those who lived in the country and were part of the 31 smaller rural tribes are sometimes differentiated by using the label .Adam, Alexander. \\"Roman antiquities: or, An account of the manners and customs of the Romans\\". London, 1835. (List of Roman tribes) The origin of the separation into orders is unclear, and it is disputed when the Romans were divided under the early kings into patricians and plebeians, or whether the (dependents) of the patricians formed a third group. Certain (\\"clans\\") were patrician, as identified by the (family name), but a might have both patrician and plebeian branches that shared a but were distinguished by a , as was the case with the Claudia. The 19th-century historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr held that plebeians began to appear at Rome during the reign of Ancus Marcius and were possibly foreigners from other parts of Italy settling in Rome as naturalized citizens. In any case, at the outset of the Roman Republic, the patricians had a near monopoly on political and social institutions. Plebeians were excluded from magistracies and religious colleges, and they were not permitted to know the laws by which they were governed. Plebeians served in the army, but rarely became military leaders. Dissatisfaction with the status quo occasionally mounted to the point that the plebeians engaged in a sort of general strike, a secessio plebis, during which they would withdraw to the mountain as a form of protest, leaving the patricians to themselves. From 494 to 287 BC, five such actions during the so-called \\"Conflict of the Orders\\" resulted in the establishment of plebeian offices (the tribunes and plebeian aediles), the publication of the laws (the Law of the Twelve Tables), the establishment of the right of plebeian‚Äìpatrician intermarriage (by the passage of the lex Canuleia), the opening of the highest offices of government and some state priesthoods to the plebeians and passage of legislation (the lex Hortensia) that made resolutions passed by the assembly of plebeians, the concilium plebis, binding on all citizens.https://www.britannica.com/topic/plebeian =Noble plebeians= During the Second Samnite War (326‚Äì304 BC), plebeians who had risen to power through these social reforms began to acquire the aura of (\\"nobility\\", more ), marking the creation of a ruling elite of nobiles that allied the interests of patricians and noble plebeians.E.T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 217. From the mid-4th century to the early 3rd century BC, several plebeian‚Äìpatrician \\"tickets\\" for the consulship repeated joint terms, suggesting a deliberate political strategy of cooperation.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005), p. 269. Although nobilitas was not a formal social rank during the Republican era, in general, a plebeian who had attained the consulship was regarded as having brought nobility to his family. Such a man was a novus homo (\\"new man\\"), a self-made noble, and his sons and descendants were nobiles.Fergus Millar, \\"The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic, 200‚Äì151 B.C.,\\" as reprinted in Rome, the Greek World, and the East (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 126; P.A. Brunt, \\"Nobilitas and novitas,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 72 (1982) 1‚Äì17.< Marius and Cicero are notable examples of novi homines in the late Republic, when many of Rome's richest and most powerful men‚Äîsuch as Lucullus, Crassus, and Pompeius‚Äîwere plebeian nobles. Some or perhaps many noble plebeians, including Cicero and Lucullus, aligned their political interests with the faction of Optimates, conservatives who sought to preserve senatorial prerogatives. By contrast, the , which sought to champion the plebs in the sense of \\"common people\\", were sometimes led by patricians such as Julius Caesar and Clodius Pulcher.  Conflict of the Orders  In 494 BCE, plebeians decided it was time to revolt against patrician officials in a pacifist manner. The struggle was known as the Conflict of the Orders. This conflict lasted approximately 200 years, finally coming to a halt in 287 BCE. Even though the conflict ended, many problems continued to arise in the feud between plebs and patricians. Prior to this struggle, patricians were in control of relatively any sort of power, with plebs and slaves having no status quo. plebs decided to protest their rights going through a series of secessions known as (secession of the plebs). = First Secession (494 BCE) = Due to the increasing tax on the working class with no benefits to show from it, the plebs decided to go on strike and flee to . The plebs established their own assembly known as the Council of Plebs, from which 10 tribunes of plebs were elected. Their job was to protect the concerns for plebs against patrician officials. = Second Secession (449 BCE) = Patricians were the only ones allowed to interpret early Roman law; many unwritten laws were known more as traditions due to the fact they were not made official. The decemvirs were in charge of composing new laws which did not show more significance to plebeians but was also made available to the general public. The final composition of laws would be known as the Law of Twelve Tables. = Third Secession = Gauius Canuleius proposed a law (the Canuleian law) that granted plebeian and patricians to intermarry. = Fifth Secession (287 BCE) = The final secession brought about a new law which would truly bring some form equality between plebs and patricians in the political offices. A new law was brought about known as Hortensian law, which banned the senate's veto of the plebeian council. That brought a halt to aristocracy-based offices based on wealth. Rome was beginning to become like a democracy.  Life  = Childhood and education = Childhood for plebeians was very different compared to their patrician counterparts since they were expected to enter the workforce at a much earlier age. Plebeians typically belonged to a lower socio-economic class than their patrician counterparts, and therefore did not have as many household servants. As a result, plebeian children were responsible for maintaining the household and caring for their aging parents. Education was limited to what their parent would teach them, which consisted of only learning the very basics of writing, reading and mathematics. Wealthier plebeians were able to send their children to schools or hire a private tutor. = Living quarters = Ruins of Plebeians in ancient Rome lived in buildings called , apartment buildings that housed many families. These apartments usually lacked running water and heat. Not all plebeians lived in these run-down conditions, as some wealthier plebs were able to live in single-family homes, called a domus. = Attire = Plebeian men wore a tunic with a belt at the waist, and women wore a long dress called a stola. = Meals = Since meat was very expensive, animal products such as pork, beef and veal would have been considered a delicacy to plebeians. Instead, a plebeian diet mainly consisted of bread and vegetables. Common flavouring for their food included honey, vinegar and different herbs and spices. A well-known condiment to this day known as 'garum', which is a fish sauce was also largely consumed. Derivatives =United States military academies= Plebes (first-year students) marching in front of Bancroft Hall, United States Naval Academy In the U.S. military, plebes are freshmen at the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, Valley Forge Military Academy and College, the Marine Military Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Georgia Military College, and California Maritime Academy. The term is also used for new cadets at the Philippine Military Academy. =British Empire= Early public schools in the United Kingdom would enroll pupils as \\"plebeians\\", as opposed to sons of gentry and aristocrats.

Vertex sets U and V are usually called the parts of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd- length cycles.. The two sets U and V may be thought of as a coloring of the graph with two colors: if one colors all nodes in U blue, and all nodes in V green, each edge has endpoints of differing colors, as is required in the graph coloring problem.. In contrast, such a coloring is impossible in the case of a non-bipartite graph, such as a triangle: after one node is colored blue and another green, the third vertex of the triangle is connected to vertices of both colors, preventing it from being assigned either color. One often writes G=(U,V,E) to denote a bipartite graph whose partition has the parts U and V, with E denoting the edges of the graph. If a bipartite graph is not connected, it may have more than one bipartition;. in this case, the (U,V,E) notation is helpful in specifying one particular bipartition that may be of importance in an application. If U=V, that is, if the two subsets have equal cardinality, then G is called a balanced bipartite graph., p. 7. If all vertices on the same side of the bipartition have the same degree, then G is called biregular. Examples When modelling relations between two different classes of objects, bipartite graphs very often arise naturally. For instance, a graph of football players and clubs, with an edge between a player and a club if the player has played for that club, is a natural example of an affiliation network, a type of bipartite graph used in social network analysis.. Another example where bipartite graphs appear naturally is in the (NP-complete) railway optimization problem, in which the input is a schedule of trains and their stops, and the goal is to find a set of train stations as small as possible such that every train visits at least one of the chosen stations. This problem can be modeled as a dominating set problem in a bipartite graph that has a vertex for each train and each station and an edge for each pair of a station and a train that stops at that station. A third example is in the academic field of numismatics. Ancient coins are made using two positive impressions of the design (the obverse and reverse). The charts numismatists produce to represent the production of coins are bipartite graphs. More abstract examples include the following: * Every tree is bipartite. * Cycle graphs with an even number of vertices are bipartite. * Every planar graph whose faces all have even length is bipartite.. This result has sometimes been called the \\"two color theorem\\"; Soifer credits it to a famous 1879 paper of Alfred Kempe containing a false proof of the four color theorem. Special cases of this are grid graphs and squaregraphs, in which every inner face consists of 4 edges and every inner vertex has four or more neighbors.. * The complete bipartite graph on m and n vertices, denoted by Kn,m is the bipartite graph G = (U, V, E), where U and V are disjoint sets of size m and n, respectively, and E connects every vertex in U with all vertices in V. It follows that Km,n has mn edges., p. 11. Closely related to the complete bipartite graphs are the crown graphs, formed from complete bipartite graphs by removing the edges of a perfect matching.. * Hypercube graphs, partial cubes, and median graphs are bipartite. In these graphs, the vertices may be labeled by bitvectors, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of ones from the vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every median graph is a partial cube.. See especially Chapter 5, \\"Partial Cubes\\", pp. 127‚Äì181. Properties =Characterization= Bipartite graphs may be characterized in several different ways: * A graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle., Theorem 2.1.3, p. 8. Asratian et al. attribute this characterization to a 1916 paper by D√©nes K≈ënig. For infinite graphs, this result requires the axiom of choice. * A graph is bipartite if and only if it is 2-colorable, (i.e. its chromatic number is less than or equal to 2). * The spectrum of a graph is symmetric if and only if it's a bipartite graph.. =K≈ënig's theorem and perfect graphs= In bipartite graphs, the size of minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching; this is K≈ënig's theorem... An alternative and equivalent form of this theorem is that the size of the maximum independent set plus the size of the maximum matching is equal to the number of vertices. In any graph without isolated vertices the size of the minimum edge cover plus the size of a maximum matching equals the number of vertices.. Combining this equality with K≈ënig's theorem leads to the facts that, in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum edge cover is equal to the size of the maximum independent set, and the size of the minimum edge cover plus the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices. Another class of related results concerns perfect graphs: every bipartite graph, the complement of every bipartite graph, the line graph of every bipartite graph, and the complement of the line graph of every bipartite graph, are all perfect. Perfection of bipartite graphs is easy to see (their chromatic number is two and their maximum clique size is also two) but perfection of the complements of bipartite graphs is less trivial, and is another restatement of K≈ënig's theorem. This was one of the results that motivated the initial definition of perfect graphs.. Perfection of the complements of line graphs of perfect graphs is yet another restatement of K≈ënig's theorem, and perfection of the line graphs themselves is a restatement of an earlier theorem of K≈ënig, that every bipartite graph has an edge coloring using a number of colors equal to its maximum degree. According to the strong perfect graph theorem, the perfect graphs have a forbidden graph characterization resembling that of bipartite graphs: a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycle as a subgraph, and a graph is perfect if and only if it has no odd cycle or its complement as an induced subgraph. The bipartite graphs, line graphs of bipartite graphs, and their complements form four out of the five basic classes of perfect graphs used in the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem.. =Degree= For a vertex, the number of adjacent vertices is called the degree of the vertex and is denoted \\\\deg(v). The degree sum formula for a bipartite graph states that :\\\\sum_{v \\\\in V} \\\\deg(v) = \\\\sum_{u \\\\in U} \\\\deg(u) = E\\\\, . The degree sequence of a bipartite graph is the pair of lists each containing the degrees of the two parts U and V. For example, the complete bipartite graph K3,5 has degree sequence (5,5,5),(3,3,3,3,3). Isomorphic bipartite graphs have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a bipartite graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic bipartite graphs may have the same degree sequence. The bipartite realization problem is the problem of finding a simple bipartite graph with the degree sequence being two given lists of natural numbers. (Trailing zeros may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the digraph.) =Relation to hypergraphs and directed graphs= The biadjacency matrix of a bipartite graph (U,V,E) is a (0,1) matrix of size U\\\\timesV that has a one for each pair of adjacent vertices and a zero for nonadjacent vertices., p. 17. Biadjacency matrices may be used to describe equivalences between bipartite graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. A hypergraph is a combinatorial structure that, like an undirected graph, has vertices and edges, but in which the edges may be arbitrary sets of vertices rather than having to have exactly two endpoints. A bipartite graph (U,V,E) may be used to model a hypergraph in which is the set of vertices of the hypergraph, is the set of hyperedges, and contains an edge from a hypergraph vertex to a hypergraph edge exactly when is one of the endpoints of . Under this correspondence, the biadjacency matrices of bipartite graphs are exactly the incidence matrices of the corresponding hypergraphs. As a special case of this correspondence between bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, any multigraph (a graph in which there may be two or more edges between the same two vertices) may be interpreted as a hypergraph in which some hyperedges have equal sets of endpoints, and represented by a bipartite graph that does not have multiple adjacencies and in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition all have degree two. A similar reinterpretation of adjacency matrices may be used to show a one-to-one correspondence between directed graphs (on a given number of labeled vertices, allowing self-loops) and balanced bipartite graphs, with the same number of vertices on both sides of the bipartition. For, the adjacency matrix of a directed graph with vertices can be any (0,1) matrix of size n\\\\times n, which can then be reinterpreted as the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph with vertices on each side of its bipartition.. Brualdi et al. credit the idea for this equivalence to . In this construction, the bipartite graph is the bipartite double cover of the directed graph. Algorithms =Testing bipartiteness= It is possible to test whether a graph is bipartite, and to return either a two-coloring (if it is bipartite) or an odd cycle (if it is not) in linear time, using depth-first search. The main idea is to assign to each vertex the color that differs from the color of its parent in the depth-first search forest, assigning colors in a preorder traversal of the depth-first-search forest. This will necessarily provide a two-coloring of the spanning forest consisting of the edges connecting vertices to their parents, but it may not properly color some of the non- forest edges. In a depth-first search forest, one of the two endpoints of every non-forest edge is an ancestor of the other endpoint, and when the depth first search discovers an edge of this type it should check that these two vertices have different colors. If they do not, then the path in the forest from ancestor to descendant, together with the miscolored edge, form an odd cycle, which is returned from the algorithm together with the result that the graph is not bipartite. However, if the algorithm terminates without detecting an odd cycle of this type, then every edge must be properly colored, and the algorithm returns the coloring together with the result that the graph is bipartite.. Alternatively, a similar procedure may be used with breadth-first search in place of depth-first search. Again, each node is given the opposite color to its parent in the search forest, in breadth-first order. If, when a vertex is colored, there exists an edge connecting it to a previously-colored vertex with the same color, then this edge together with the paths in the breadth-first search forest connecting its two endpoints to their lowest common ancestor forms an odd cycle. If the algorithm terminates without finding an odd cycle in this way, then it must have found a proper coloring, and can safely conclude that the graph is bipartite.. For the intersection graphs of n line segments or other simple shapes in the Euclidean plane, it is possible to test whether the graph is bipartite and return either a two- coloring or an odd cycle in time O(n\\\\log n), even though the graph itself may have up to O\\\\left(n^2\\\\right) edges. . =Odd cycle transversal= A graph with an odd cycle transversal of size 2: removing the two blue bottom vertices leaves a bipartite graph. Odd cycle transversal is an NP-complete algorithmic problem that asks, given a graph G = (V,E) and a number k, whether there exists a set of k vertices whose removal from G would cause the resulting graph to be bipartite. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning that there is an algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the graph multiplied by a larger function of k.. The name odd cycle transversal comes from the fact that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles. Hence, to delete vertices from a graph in order to obtain a bipartite graph, one needs to \\"hit all odd cycle\\", or find a so-called odd cycle transversal set. In the illustration, every odd cycle in the graph contains the blue (the bottommost) vertices, so removing those vertices kills all odd cycles and leaves a bipartite graph. The edge bipartization problem is the algorithmic problem of deleting as few edges as possible to make a graph bipartite and is also an important problem in graph modification algorithmics. This problem is also fixed-parameter tractable, and can be solved in time O\\\\left(2^k m^2\\\\right), where k is the number of edges to delete and m is the number of edges in the input graph. =Matching= A matching in a graph is a subset of its edges, no two of which share an endpoint. Polynomial time algorithms are known for many algorithmic problems on matchings, including maximum matching (finding a matching that uses as many edges as possible), maximum weight matching, and stable marriage.. In many cases, matching problems are simpler to solve on bipartite graphs than on non- bipartite graphs,, p. 463: \\"Nonbipartite matching problems are more difficult to solve because they do not reduce to standard network flow problems.\\" and many matching algorithms such as the Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm for maximum cardinality matching. work correctly only on bipartite inputs. As a simple example, suppose that a set P of people are all seeking jobs from among a set of J jobs, with not all people suitable for all jobs. This situation can be modeled as a bipartite graph (P,J,E) where an edge connects each job-seeker with each suitable job., Application 12.1 Bipartite Personnel Assignment, pp. 463‚Äì464. A perfect matching describes a way of simultaneously satisfying all job-seekers and filling all jobs; Hall's marriage theorem provides a characterization of the bipartite graphs which allow perfect matchings. The National Resident Matching Program applies graph matching methods to solve this problem for U.S. medical student job-seekers and hospital residency jobs.. The Dulmage‚ÄìMendelsohn decomposition is a structural decomposition of bipartite graphs that is useful in finding maximum matchings.. Additional applications Bipartite graphs are extensively used in modern coding theory, especially to decode codewords received from the channel. Factor graphs and Tanner graphs are examples of this. A Tanner graph is a bipartite graph in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition represent digits of a codeword, and the vertices on the other side represent combinations of digits that are expected to sum to zero in a codeword without errors.. A factor graph is a closely related belief network used for probabilistic decoding of LDPC and turbo codes., p. 686. In computer science, a Petri net is a mathematical modeling tool used in analysis and simulations of concurrent systems. A system is modeled as a bipartite directed graph with two sets of nodes: A set of \\"place\\" nodes that contain resources, and a set of \\"event\\" nodes which generate and/or consume resources. There are additional constraints on the nodes and edges that constrain the behavior of the system. Petri nets utilize the properties of bipartite directed graphs and other properties to allow mathematical proofs of the behavior of systems while also allowing easy implementation of simulations of the system.. In projective geometry, Levi graphs are a form of bipartite graph used to model the incidences between points and lines in a configuration. Corresponding to the geometric property of points and lines that every two lines meet in at most one point and every two points be connected with a single line, Levi graphs necessarily do not contain any cycles of length four, so their girth must be six or more..

This made him the most widely known and influential wine critic in the world.Steinberger, Mike, Slate.com (June 17, 2002). The Great and Powerful ShnozBruce-Gardyne, Tom, The Herald (August 9, 2010). The world‚Äôs leading wine critic Biography Parker was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a construction equipment salesman. He is an honors graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, with a major in history and a minor in art history. He continued his education at University of Maryland School of Law at the urban campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, graduating in 1973 with a Juris Doctor degree. He discovered wine as a student visiting Alsace, where Patricia, now his wife, was studying. For over ten years, he was assistant general counsel for the Farm Credit Banks of Baltimore; he resigned in March 1984 to focus on writing about wine. In 1975, Parker began writing a wine guidebook. Taking his cue from consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Parker wanted to write about wine without the conflicts of interest that might taint the opinions of other critics who also make a living selling wine. In 1978, he published a direct- mail newsletter called The Baltimore-Washington Wine Advocate, which was later renamed The Wine Advocate. The first issue was sent free to consumers from mailing lists Parker purchased from several major wine retailers. Six hundred charter subscribers paid to receive the second issue published later that year. Parker received worldwide attention when he called the 1982 vintage in Bordeaux superb, contrary to the opinions of many other critics, such as San Francisco critic Robert Finigan, who felt it was too low-acid and ripe. While there is still debate about the timelessness of the vintage, prices of 1982 Bordeaux remain consistently higher than other vintages. More than twenty years later, The Wine Advocate has over 50,000 subscribers, primarily in the United States, but with significant readership in over 37 other countries. While other wine publications have more subscribers, The Wine Advocate is still considered to exert a significant influence on wine consumers' buying habits, particularly in America. New York Times wine critic Frank Prial asserted that \\"Robert M. Parker Jr. is the most influential wine critic in the world.\\" A lengthy profile of Parker entitled \\"The Million Dollar Nose\\" ran in The Atlantic Monthly in December 2000. Among other claims, Parker told the author that he tastes 10,000 wines a year and \\"remembers every wine he has tasted over the past thirty-two years and, within a few points, every score he has given as well.\\" Yet, in a public blind tasting of fifteen top wines from Bordeaux 2005‚Äîwhich he has called \\"the greatest vintage of my lifetime\\"‚ÄîParker could not correctly identify any of the wines, confusing left bank wines for right several times. In addition to writing and tasting for The Wine Advocate, which is published six times a year in Monkton, Maryland, Parker has been a contributing editor for Food and Wine Magazine and BusinessWeek. He has also written periodically for the British magazine The Field and has been the wine critic for France's L'Express magazine, the first time a non-Frenchman has held this position.About Robert M. Parker Jr. Among media that focus on the influence and effects of Parker on the global wine industry are the 2005 unauthorized biography The Emperor of Wine by Elin McCoy, the 2004 documentary film Mondovino by Jonathan Nossiter,Asimov, Eric, The New York Times (March 22, 2006). Decanting Robert Parker the 2008 book The Battle for Wine and Love: Or How I Saved the World from Parkerization by Alice Feiring,Asimov, Eric, The New York Times (May 21, 2008). Good Wine Reading With Mellow Aftertaste and the 2010 French language bande dessin√©e comic book, Robert Parker: Les Sept P√™ch√©s capiteux. Parker's nose and palate are insured for $1 million. Parker disclosed end of 2012, that he will sell a \\"substantial interest\\" in his newsletter and plans to step down as editor in chief. His new partners are a trio of Singapore-based hedge fund investors.Lettie Teague: Wine Advocate Will Stay Put, and in Print The Wall Street Journal, 12 December 2012 Impact of Parker on the world of wine =A new role for the wine critic= Until the 1970s, wine criticism was usually complementary to the production or trade of wine. The conflict of interest that might ensue from this close relationship was accepted by consumers, as they consulted wine reviews to gain an introduction to the world of wine, and not necessarily for advice on getting good value for their money. Hence, before Robert Parker, wine critics almost always had some link to the production or trade of wines. Two wine critics were particularly influential in inspiring and defining Robert Parker: * Robert Lawrence Balzer's charisma inspired Parker. Like his contemporaries, Balzer rarely wrote negative statements about wines. He even once published a book under his name that had actually been written by wine grower Paul Masson. * Robert Finigan was Parker's forerunner in consumer-oriented wine reviewing. In the monthly Robert Finigan's Private Guide to Wine, launched in 1972, Finigan offered consumer-oriented, independent wine criticism, just as Parker did after him. Finigan helped consumers make decisions by developing standard evaluation criteria; his qualitative comments were straightforward and understandable, and each wine was ranked on a quality scale (exceptional, above average, average, below average). Parker is a consumer advocate who admires Ralph Nader and has been critical of most wine critics, who traditionally have been part of the wine industry and have had vested interests. According to Mike Steinberger, Parker has inadvertently made becoming a wine critic in the future almost impossible, since‚Äî in part because of the success of his scoring system‚Äîit is now prohibitively expensive to taste the very wines one should criticize. If it behooves a critic to understand, say, Ch√¢teau Lafite 1982, 2000, 2003, and 2005 before assessing the latest vintage: the critic must drink wine worth tens of thousands of dollars before beginning the review. This was not true when Steinberger became a connoisseur in the 1970s. =Parker's 100-point rating system= One of the most influential and controversial features of Parker's wine criticism is his 100-point rating system, which he popularized in conjunction with his friend Victor Morgenroth. Parker designed the system to counter what he believed to be confusing or inflated ratings by other wine writers‚Äîmany of whom he accused of a conflict of interest, as they often had a financial interest in the wines they rated. The scale, now widely imitated in other publications (such as Wine Spectator), ranks wine on a scale from 50 to 100 points based upon the wine's color and appearance, aroma and bouquet, flavor and finish, and overall quality level or potential. Therefore, 51 rather than 100 different ratings are possible. Although some critics, such as Jancis Robinson, argue that numerical rating systems are questionable‚Äîgiven the subjectivity of wine tasting and the variance in scores that a wine's age and the circumstances of tasting can cause‚Äîsimilar 100-point scoring systems are widely used by American reviewers. Many British reviewers, such as Jancis Robinson and Clive Coates, still prefer a 20-point system. Retailers in North America often mark wines with Parker's point scores, using printed cards attached to the shelves. Parker cautions buyers that they should read the tasting notes to determine whether or not the wine is made in a style they will like; he states on his website: Parker argues that he scores wines on how much pleasure they give him. He, and others, have said that it is the obscurity, corruption, and other problems of the appellation system that made his consumer-oriented approach necessary. For example, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 was based entirely upon the ch√¢teau's reputation and trading price in 1855. However, since then many ch√¢teaux have sold much of their vineyards; others have bought additional vineyards far away. The original winemakers are long dead. Parker says that this state of affairs was responsible for creating an injustice for consumers, causing mediocre wine to be sold at too high a price, and good wine to be sold at too low a price. He says of the 1855 classifications, \\"At most, these classifications should be regarded by both the wine connoisseur and novice as informational items of historical significance only.\\" Parker has admitted that emotions do matter, contrary to the seeming objectivity of the 100-point scale: \\"I really think probably the only difference between a 96-, 97-, 98-, 99-, and 100-point wine is really the emotion of the moment.\\" Parker is considered an unusually fast taster, and during an initial assessment he may keep a wine in his mouth for only four or five seconds before determining whether it is potentially a wine of 80 points or above. Mediocre wines will then be dismissed while those with potential are tasted twice or three times in succession before the final score is determined. =Impact on the supply: the \\"Parkerization\\" of wine= Parker's impact on the style of fine wines has generated controversy. Parker is highly critical of \\"those who make 'industrial wines with little flavor and no authenticity'\\" and he believes that there are still undiscovered regions and wines that can successfully challenge the wine establishment. Critics such as Golo Weber claim that Parker likes less-acidic, riper wines with significant amounts of oak, alcohol, and extract. This supposed \\"Parker taste\\" may be less the result of Parker's own preferences than of a trend initiated by √âmile Peynaud, the French oenologist and father of the so-called \\"international wines\\". In the 1970s, winemakers avoided the late harvests, when the grapes were mature, in order to avoid the risks of end-of-season rains. Peynaud proposed that winemakers should wait to harvest until the grape was fully mature, or even over-mature. He also insisted on control of malolactic fermentation through the use of stainless steel vessels. This new approach led to changes in viticulture and winemaking practices, such as reducing yield by green harvesting, harvesting grapes as late as possible for maximum ripeness, not filtering the wine, and using new techniques‚Äîsuch as microoxygenation‚Äîto soften tannins. These widespread changes in technique have been called \\"Parkerization\\", also sometimes known as \\"The International Style\\", and have led to fear of a homogenization of wine styles around the world as Parker's \\"tastes are irrevocably changing the way some French wines are made\\", according to the BBC's Caroline Wyatt. Indeed, certain low-producing \\"boutique\\" wineries, among others, have received high scores from Parker for wines made in this style. Parker disputes the notion of growing homogeneity and argues for the opposite: \\"When I started tasting wines, in the 1970s, we were on a slippery slope. There was a standardization of wines, where you couldn't tell a Chianti from a cabernet. That's pretty much stopped now.\\" Jacques Hebrard, the manager of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc, was once outraged at Parker's evaluation and asked Parker to re-taste the wine. Upon his return, Hebrard's dog attacked Parker as the manager stood by idly and watched. Parker says that when he asked for a bandage to stop the bleeding from his leg, Hebrard instead gave him a copy of the offending newsletter. Hebrard denies that Parker was bleeding. Wine critic Prial says \\"The Bordeaux wine establishment feels threatened by these new-style wines... and is engaged in an increasingly bitter fight against Parker and his influence.\\" =Impact on the market= Impact on prices There is evidence that Parker's rating scale has a dual effect on prices and sales, with claims from the wine industry that a Parker top score is valued at potentially ¬£5 million. * When Parker declined to review the 2002 Bordeaux vintage \\"in barrel,\\" the vintners were forced to drop their prices. * According to one Bordeaux shipper cited by McCoy, \\"the difference between a score of 85 and 95 [for one wine] was 6 to 7 million Euro\\", and a \\"bottle rated 100 can multiply its price fourfold.\\" * Ch√¢teau Quinault, which used to have hard time selling its wine at 100 francs a bottle, saw its 1998 vintage rise in price in half a day to 125 francs after Parker gave it a 92 rating. * According to a 2005 economic analysis, Parker's scores would inflate the prices of already highly rated wines but, for the less good ones, it would not decrease their sales nor even increase their prices. Whatever his influence, Parker alone cannot impact the market price for a wine if he is alone against the mainstream. The famous controversy around the Ch√¢teau Pavie 2003 is an example of this: despite Parker's positive ratings, the wine in bottle sold 30% cheaper than en primeur. In a statistical analysis published in New Political Economy, political scientist Colin Hay suggests that Parker has a significant impact on the price of en primeur Bordeaux wines: Hay also argues that Hay notes that Parker's influence on consumer preferences is not so great as it is on prices. Creation of new market segments Parker strongly influenced the creation of garagiste wines, created by a group of innovative winemakers in the Bordeaux region of France. Limits to Parker's influences Parker is an avid fan of Bordeaux, and some of his critics observe that his focus is largely limited to French wine. In recent years, he has taken on additional staff for The Wine Advocate, which has enabled the publication to expand into other areas, such as Greek and Israeli wines. Still, his influence is most keenly felt by Bordeaux, California, and Rh√¥ne wines. Parker's influence on Burgundy wines was lessened as the result of a libel lawsuit filed against him by Domaine Faiveley. In the third edition of his Wine Buyer's Guide, Parker reported that \\"the Faiveley wines tasted abroad would be less rich than those one can taste on the spot [...]\\". In other words, Parker accused Faiveley of cheating. Faiveley sued Parker for libel; in February 1994, Parker was requested to appear in front of the Paris superior court (tribunal de grande instance). The case was settled out of court. It was eventually discovered that the difference in taste that Parker identified was due to improper storage of the wine at the American importer's warehouse, causing the wine to be \\"cooked.\\" Parker delegated coverage of the Burgundy and Alsace regions to Pierre-Antoine Rovani in April 1997. =Controversy= Parker has stated very clearly, both in The Wine Advocate and his books, that his advice stands on high ethical standards, and that independence and impartiality constitute his two most important values. By abiding by these standards, he says, he seeks to guarantee that his valuations will be pro-consumer, and not pro-industry. Several published sources offer accounts that may call Parker's independence and impartiality into question. In her book Emperor of Wine, Elin McCoy describes a positive article Parker wrote in the second issue of The Baltimore/Washington Wine Advocate about MacArthur Liquors and its manager, Addy Bassin. That article fails to mention that Mr. Bassin sold Parker a list of MacArthur's customers for use in mailing out the first, free issue of the Advocate, a potential conflict of interest. In issue 164 of The Wine Advocate, Parker wrote a long article about Jeffrey Davies, a wine trader based in Bordeaux. As Hanna Agostini and Marie-Fran√ßoise Guichard point out in their book Robert Parker, Anatomy of a Myth, what Parker failed to mention was that he tasted wines with Davies, not by himself‚Äîyet Parker has repeatedly stated that an impartial wine critic should taste wines alone. Davies advised Parker not to publish his comments on the 2004 Bordeaux in issue 164, as Parker had planned, because they would have suffered from their comparison with the much better 2003 and 2005. Parker followed Davies' advice, and published those comments in the following issue instead. The second issue of The Baltimore/Washington Wine Advocate stated \\"Robert Parker has no interest, direct or indirect, financial or any other, in importing, distributing or selling wines.\\" In the early 1990s, Parker invested in an Oregon vineyard with his brother-in-law: Les Beaux-Fr√®res (\\"The Brothers-in-Law\\"). He promised never to review any wines produced there in The Wine Advocate. Two of Parker's tasters had, or still have, an interest in the distribution or the sale of wines, according to published accounts. * Until January 1, 2007, David Schildknecht spent half of his time importing and distributing wines, and the other half critiquing wine for The Wine Advocate. Today he is a full-time critic for The Wine Advocate. * Kevin Zraly is the vice-president of Smith and Wollensky Restaurants, a group of 17 restaurants with a substantial wine list. Robert Parker's goddaughter, Marie Raynaud, is the daughter of Alain Raynaud‚Äîthe co-owner of Ch√¢teau la Croix-de-Gay in Pomerol and former owner of Ch√¢teau Quinault in Saint-√âmilion. Mr. Raynaud was the President of the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux, an advocacy group for the Grand Crus of Bordeaux, between 1994 and 2000. Yale University professor, econometrician, and lawyer Ian Ayres wrote about Robert Parker's conflict with Orley Ashenfelter, the publisher of Liquid Assets: The International Guide to Fine Wines, in his book Super Crunchers. Ashenfelter devised a formula for predicting wine quality based on weather data such as rainfall and temperature that Parker characterized as \\"ludicrous and absurd.\\" Ashenfelter was able to show that Parker's initial ratings of vintages had been biased upward, requiring him to revise his rankings downward more often than not. Says Ayres, \\"Both the wine dealers and writers have a vested interest in maintaining their informational monopoly on the quality of wine.\\" Ayres pointed out that Ashenfelter's predictions have proven to be remarkably accurate, and claimed the wine critics' \\"predictions now correspond much more closely to [Ashenfelter's] simple equation results.\\" Bibliography  Awards and recognition * 1993 - Chevalier de l'Ordre National du M√©rite * 1993 - Wine and Vine Communication Award from Moet-Hennessey * 1995 - Declared Honorary Citizen of Chateauneuf du Pape * 1997 - James Beard Foundation Wine and Spirits Professional of 1997 * 1999 - Chevalier de l'Ordre de la L√©gion d'honneur * 2002 - Commendatore dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana * 2005 - Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur * 2008 - Elected to the Wine Media Guild Hall of Fame Robert Parker is one of only a few foreigners to have received France's two highest Presidential honors, and is the first wine critic to have received such recognitions in France and in Italy.

around a network of six vertices In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete. Hamiltonian paths and cycles are named after William Rowan Hamilton who invented the icosian game, now also known as Hamilton's puzzle, which involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron. Hamilton solved this problem using the icosian calculus, an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternions (also invented by Hamilton). This solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs. Despite being named after Hamilton, Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by Thomas Kirkman, who, in particular, gave an example of a polyhedron without Hamiltonian cycles.. Even earlier, Hamiltonian cycles and paths in the knight's graph of the chessboard, the knight's tour, had been studied in the 9th century in Indian mathematics by Rudrata, and around the same time in Islamic mathematics by al-Adli ar-Rumi. In 18th century Europe, knight's tours were published by Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler.. Definitions A Hamiltonian path or traceable path is a path that visits each vertex of the graph exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A graph is Hamiltonian-connected if for every pair of vertices there is a Hamiltonian path between the two vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle, Hamiltonian circuit, vertex tour or graph cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph. Similar notions may be defined for directed graphs, where each edge (arc) of a path or cycle can only be traced in a single direction (i.e., the vertices are connected with arrows and the edges traced \\"tail-to- head\\"). A Hamiltonian decomposition is an edge decomposition of a graph into Hamiltonian circuits. A Hamilton maze is a type of logic puzzle in which the goal is to find the unique Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph. Examples *a complete graph with more than two vertices is Hamiltonian *every cycle graph is Hamiltonian *every tournament has an odd number of Hamiltonian paths (R√©dei 1934) *every platonic solid, considered as a graph, is HamiltonianGardner, M. \\"Mathematical Games: About the Remarkable Similarity between the Icosian Game and the Towers of Hanoi.\\" Sci. Amer. 196, 150‚Äì156, May 1957 *the Cayley graph of a finite Coxeter group is Hamiltonian (For more information on Hamiltonian paths in Cayley graphs, see the Lov√°sz conjecture) Properties The Herschel graph is the smallest possible polyhedral graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. A possible Hamiltonian path is shown. Any Hamiltonian cycle can be converted to a Hamiltonian path by removing one of its edges, but a Hamiltonian path can be extended to Hamiltonian cycle only if its endpoints are adjacent. All Hamiltonian graphs are biconnected, but a biconnected graph need not be Hamiltonian (see, for example, the Petersen graph). An Eulerian graph G (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree) necessarily has an Euler tour, a closed walk passing through each edge of G exactly once. This tour corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the line graph L(G), so the line graph of every Eulerian graph is Hamiltonian. Line graphs may have other Hamiltonian cycles that do not correspond to Euler tours, and in particular the line graph L(G) of every Hamiltonian graph G is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether the graph G is Eulerian.. A tournament (with more than two vertices) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is strongly connected. The number of different Hamiltonian cycles in a complete undirected graph on n vertices is and in a complete directed graph on n vertices is . These counts assume that cycles that are the same apart from their starting point are not counted separately.  Bondy‚ÄìChv√°tal theorem  The best vertex degree characterization of Hamiltonian graphs was provided in 1972 by the Bondy‚ÄìChv√°tal theorem, which generalizes earlier results by G. A. Dirac (1952) and √òystein Ore. Both Dirac's and Ore's theorems can also be derived from P√≥sa's theorem (1962). Hamiltonicity has been widely studied with relation to various parameters such as graph density, toughness, forbidden subgraphs and distance among other parameters. Dirac and Ore's theorems basically state that a graph is Hamiltonian if it has enough edges. The Bondy‚ÄìChv√°tal theorem operates on the closure cl(G) of a graph G with n vertices, obtained by repeatedly adding a new edge uv connecting a nonadjacent pair of vertices u and v with until no more pairs with this property can be found. :Bondy‚ÄìChv√°tal Theorem (1976). A graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its closure is Hamiltonian. As complete graphs are Hamiltonian, all graphs whose closure is complete are Hamiltonian, which is the content of the following earlier theorems by Dirac and Ore. :Dirac's Theorem (1952). A simple graph with n vertices () is Hamiltonian if every vertex has degree \\\\tfrac{n}{2} or greater. :Ore's Theorem (1960). A simple graph with n vertices (n ‚â• 3) is Hamiltonian if, for every pair of non-adjacent vertices, the sum of their degrees is n or greater. The following theorems can be regarded as directed versions: :Ghouila-Houiri (1960). A strongly connected simple directed graph with n vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a full degree greater than or equal to n. :Meyniel (1973). A strongly connected simple directed graph with n vertices is Hamiltonian if the sum of full degrees of every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices is greater than or equal to . The number of vertices must be doubled because each undirected edge corresponds to two directed arcs and thus the degree of a vertex in the directed graph is twice the degree in the undirected graph. :Rahman-Kaykobad (2005). A simple graph with n vertices has a Hamiltonian path if, for every non-adjacent vertex pairs the sum of their degrees and their shortest path length is greater than n. The above theorem can only recognize the existence of a Hamiltonian path in a graph and not a Hamiltonian Cycle. Many of these results have analogues for balanced bipartite graphs, in which the vertex degrees are compared to the number of vertices on a single side of the bipartition rather than the number of vertices in the whole graph.  Existence of Hamiltonian cycles in planar graphs  ; Theorem (Whitney, 1931) :A 4-connected planar triangulation has a Hamiltonian cycle. ; Theorem (Tutte, 1956) :A 4-connected planar graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.  The Hamiltonian cycle polynomial  An algebraic representation of the Hamiltonian cycles of a given weighted digraph (whose arcs are assigned weights from a certain ground field) is the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of its weighted adjacency matrix defined as the sum of the products of the arc weights of the digraph's Hamiltonian cycles. This polynomial is not identically zero as a function in the arc weights if and only if the digraph is Hamiltonian.

They are closely related to calidrid sandpipers and might be considered members of the tribe Calidriini. The genus Arenaria was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres) as the type species. The genus name arenaria is from Latin arenarius, \\"inhabiting sand\\", from arena, \\"sand\\". The genus contains two species: the ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres) and the black turnstone (Arenaria melanocephala). Both birds are distinctive medium-sized waders. Their length is typically between 20 and 25 cm, with a wingspan between 50 and 60 cm and a body mass between 110 and 130gm. For waders their build is stocky, with short, slightly upturned, wedge shaped bills. They are high Arctic breeders, and are migratory. Their strong necks and powerful, slightly upturned bills are adapted to their feeding technique. As the name implies, these species overturn stones, seaweed, and similar items in search of invertebrate prey.Svensson, Lars et al. Collins Bird Guide 2nd ed. Publisher: Collins 2010. They are strictly coastal, prefer stony beaches to sand, and often share beach space with other species of waders such as purple sandpipers. Their appearance in flight is striking, with white patches on the back, wings and tail. Ruddy turnstone in breeding plumage Black turnstone in summer plumage The ruddy turnstone (or just turnstone in Europe), Arenaria interpres, has a circumpolar distribution, and is a very long distance migrant, wintering on coasts as far south as South Africa and Australia. It is thus a common sight on coasts almost everywhere in the world. In breeding plumage, this is a showy bird, with a black-and-white head, chestnut back, white underparts and red legs. The drabber winter plumage is basically brown above and white below. This is a generally tame bird and is an opportunist feeder. Unlike most waders, it will scavenge, and has a phenomenal list of recorded food items, including human corpses and coconut. The call is a staccato tuck- tuck- tuck. The ruddy turnstone is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The black turnstone (Arenaria melanocephala) has a similar structure to its widespread relative, but has black upperparts and chest, and white below. It has a much more restricted range than the ruddy turnstone, breeding in western Alaska, and wintering mainly on the Pacific coast of the United States. There exists a fossil bone, a distal piece of tarsometatarsus found in the Edson Beds of Sherman County, Kansas. Dating from the mid-Blancan some 4-3 million years ago, it appears to be from a calidriid somewhat similar to a pectoral sandpiper, but has some traits reminiscent of turnstones. Depending on which traits are apomorphic and plesiomorphic, it may be an ancestral representative of either lineage.

The scientific name is from Latin. The genus name arenaria derives from arenarius, \\"inhabiting sand, from arena, \\"sand\\". The specific interpres means \\"messenger\\"; when visiting Gotland in 1741, Linnaeus thought that the Swedish word Tolk \\"interpreter\\" applied to this species, but in the local dialect the word means \\"legs\\" and is used for the redshank. It is now classified in the sandpiper family Scolopacidae but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family Charadriidae. It is a highly migratory bird, breeding in northern parts of Eurasia and North America and flying south to winter on coastlines almost worldwide. It is the only species of turnstone in much of its range and is often known simply as turnstone. Description It is a fairly small and stocky bird, long with a wingspan of and a weight of . The dark, wedge-shaped bill is long and slightly upturned. The legs are fairly short at and are bright orange. In all seasons, the plumage is dominated by a harlequin-like pattern of black and white. Breeding birds have reddish-brown upper parts with black markings. The head is mainly white with black streaks on the crown and a black pattern on the face. The breast is mainly black apart from a white patch on the sides. The rest of the underparts are white. In flight it reveals a white wingbar, white patch near the base of the wing and white lower back, rump and tail with dark bands on the uppertail-coverts and near the tip of the tail. The female is slightly duller than the male and has a browner head with more streaking. Non-breeding adults are duller than breeding birds and have dark grey-brown upperparts with black mottling and a dark head with little white. Juvenile birds have a pale brown head and pale fringes to the upperpart feathers creating a scaly impression. Birds of the subspecies morinella are smaller with darker upperparts and less streaking on the crown. The ruddy turnstone has a staccato, rattling call and also a chattering alarm-call which is mainly given during the breeding season.

The subspecies A. i. morinella occurs in northern Alaska and in Arctic Canada as far east as Baffin Island. A. i. interpres breeds in western Alaska, Ellesmere Island, Greenland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and northern Russia. It formerly bred on the Baltic coast of Germany and has possibly bred in Scotland and the Faroe Islands. In the Americas, the species winters on coastlines from Washington and Massachusetts southwards to the southern tip of South America although it is scarce in southern parts of Chile and Argentina and is only an unconfirmed vagrant in the Falkland Islands. In Europe, it winters in western regions from Iceland, Norway and Denmark southwards. Only small numbers are found on Mediterranean coasts. In Africa, it is common all the way down to South Africa with good numbers on many offshore islands. In Asia, it is widespread in the south with birds wintering as far north as southern China and Japan (mainly in the Ryukyu Islands). It occurs south to Tasmania and New Zealand and is present on many Pacific islands. Some non- breeding birds remain year round in many parts of the wintering range, with some of those birds still taking on breeding plumage in the spring and summer. Behaviour =Feeding and diet= The ruddy turnstone has a varied diet including carrion, eggs and plant material but it feeds mainly on invertebrates. Insects are particularly important in the breeding season. At other times it also takes crustaceans, molluscs and worms. It often flips over stones and other objects to get at prey items hiding underneath; this behaviour is the origin of the name \\"turnstone\\". It usually forages in flocks. They have also been observed preying on the eggs of other bird species such as gulls, terns, ducks, and even other turnstones, though this behaviour is uncommon. In the majority of observed cases, turnstones typically go after undefended or unattended nests, puncturing the shells with their beaks to get at the contents within. Ruddy turnstones engage in a variety of behaviours to locate and capture prey. These behaviours can be placed into six general categories: * Routing ‚Äî The turnstone manipulates piles of seaweed through flicking, bulldozing, and pecking to expose small crustaceans or gastropod molluscs hidden underneath. * Turning stones ‚Äî As suggested by its name, the turnstone flicks stones with its bill to uncover hidden littorinids and gammarid amphipods. * Digging ‚Äî With small flicks of its bill, the turnstone creates holes in the ground substrate (usually sand or mud) and then pecks at the exposed prey - often sandhoppers or seaweed flies. * Probing ‚Äî The turnstone inserts its bill more than a quarter-length into the ground to get at littorinids and other gastropods. * Hammer‚Äìprobing ‚Äî The turnstone cracks open its prey's shell by using its bill as a hammer, and then extracts the animal inside through pecking and probing. * Surface pecking ‚Äî The turnstone uses short, shallow pecks (less than a quarter bill-length) to get at prey at or just below the ground's surface. There is evidence that turnstones vary between these feeding behaviours based on individual preference, sex, and even social status with respect to other turnstones. In one studied population, dominant individuals tended to engage in routing while preventing subordinates from doing the same. When these dominant individuals were temporarily removed, some of the subordinates started to rout, while others enacted no change in foraging strategy. =Aggression and territory defence= When foraging, turnstones adopt different postures indicative of their level of dominance. A lowered tail and a hunched stance is associated with chasing and aggression, and thus a dominant individual. Dominance in aggression is age-related, with juveniles assuming the subordinate role a disproportionate amount of the time. The plumage patterns of ruddy turnstones exhibit an unusual amount of variation in comparison with other shorebirds. Turnstones use these unique plumage patterns to recognize individuals and discriminate intruders in their territory from neighbours occupying an adjacent territory. When a fake fiberglass turnstone model is placed in a turnstone's territory, the occupant is less likely to respond aggressively if the model is painted to have the plumage pattern of a neighbouring turnstone. =Ecology= Ruddy turnstones can survive in a wide range of habitats and climatic conditions from Arctic to tropical. The typical breeding habitat is open tundra with water nearby. Outside the breeding season, it is found along coasts, particularly on rocky or stony shores. It is often found on man-made structures such as breakwaters and jetties. It may venture onto open grassy areas near the coast. Small numbers sometimes turn up on inland wetlands, especially during the spring and autumn migrations. In terms of wintering sites, ruddy turnstones are particularly faithful to specific locations. A study published in 2009 examined turnstones wintering along a stretch of coastline in the Firth of Clyde. It found that 95% of birds resident to the area at the end of winter returned the following autumn. The same study also confirmed ruddy turnstones as one of the longest lived wader species, with annual adult mortality rates of under 15%. Their average lifespan is 9 years with 19 years and 2 months being the longest recorded. =Reproduction= Breeding-plumaged adult on nest It is a monogamous bird and pairs may remain together for more than one breeding season. The nest is a shallow scrape, often with a lining of leaves. It is about across and deep. It may be built amongst vegetation or on bare stony or rocky ground. Several pairs may nest close together. A single clutch of two to five eggs is laid with four being most common. The eggs measure about and weigh around . They are smooth, slightly glossy and oval to pear- shaped. They are variable in colour but are commonly pale green-brown with dark brown markings, densest at the larger end. Incubation begins when the first egg is laid and lasts for about 22‚Äì24 days. The female is mainly responsible for incubating the eggs but the male may help towards the end. The young birds are precocial and are able to leave the nest soon after hatching. They are buff above with dark grey markings and are white below. They are able to feed themselves but are protected by the parents, particularly the male. They fledge after 19‚Äì21 days. Status and conservation According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the ruddy turnstone population is currently very stable. Environment Canada surveys suggest that they have in fact decreased in abundance relative to the 1970s, and face a variety of threats during migration and winter. They estimate that the Canadian population is 100,000‚Äì500,000 adults. The Canadian Wildlife Service estimates that the worldwide population of ruddy turnstones is 449,000, and that 235,000 are breeding in North America while the rest are breeding throughout the Arctic regions. They are very common and widespread. Their remote breeding range and widespread winter range should help them remain a common species.

It is one of two species of turnstone in the genus Arenaria the ruddy turnstone (A. interpres) being the other. It is now classified in the sandpiper family, Scolopacidae, but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family, Charadriidae. It is native to the west coast of North America and breeds only in Alaska. Description Black Turnstone in Humboldt County, California. It is 22‚Äì25 centimeters long and weighs 100‚Äì170 grams. The black bill is 20‚Äì27 millimeters long and slightly upturned. The legs and feet are blackish-brown with a reddish tinge. The bird is largely black and white in appearance. Breeding-plumaged adults have a black head and breast apart from a white spot between the eye and bill, a white stripe over the eye and white flecks on the sides of the breast. The upperparts are blackish-brown with pale fringes to the wing-coverts and scapular feathers. The belly and vent are white. In flight it shows a white wingbar, white shoulder patch and white tail with a broad black band across it. There is white from the lower back to the uppertail-coverts apart from a dark bar across the rump. In winter the head and breast become largely dark brown with little white. Juveniles are similar to winter adults but browner with buff fringes to the wing-coverts and scapulars and a grey-brown tip to the tail. The ruddy turnstone is similar but has rufous-brown markings on the upperparts and more white on the head and breast, particularly in breeding plumage. It has narrower wings and a narrower white wingbar. Its legs are orange and brighter than those of the black turnstone though there can be some overlap. The black turnstone has a variety of calls, especially a rattling trill which can be heard throughout the year. This call is higher and less harsh than the similar call of the ruddy turnstone. Other calls include a loud, screeching alarm call and a soft, purring call uttered to young chicks. Displaying males produce a long series of staccato notes in flight as well as chirruping trills on the ground. Distribution It breeds in western Alaska from the Alaska Peninsula in the south to Point Hope in the north. The bulk of the population nests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. It usually nests near the coast but in some areas it occurs further inland along the shores of rivers and lakes. There are a handful of records from north-east Siberia but there has been no sign of breeding there. The world population is estimated at 95,000 birds with about 80,000 of these in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. It winters on rocky shores along the Pacific coast of North America from southern Alaska southwards as far as north-west Mexico where it occurs in Baja California and Sonora with a single record from Nayarit. It is very occasionally seen inland during spring and fall migration; there are a number of records from the Salton Sea in southern California and scattered sightings from inland US states including Montana, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. Vagrant birds have been recorded from Yukon and the Northwest Territories and there is one record from San Crist√≥bal Island in the Gal√°pagos Islands. Ecology Winter-plumaged bird in California. It feeds mainly on invertebrates, particularly crustaceans and mollusks in winter and insects during the breeding season. Seeds, eggs and carrion are also taken. At the breeding grounds it mainly feeds in wet meadows with sedges. In winter, its typical habitat is rocky coasts but it also feeds on beaches, mudflats and man-made structures such as jetties and breakwaters. It uses its bill to turn over stones, algal mats and other objects to get at prey hidden beneath. It arrives on its breeding ground from early May to early June with the males arriving first. The birds often return to the same territory and pair with the same mate as previous years. The nest is a scrape dug mainly by the male. It is usually located amongst sedges or grasses or under willows. Four eggs are usually laid; they are olive or pale greenish with darker spots. The eggs are incubated for 21‚Äì24 days by both parents. The young birds are precocial and are able to leave the nest and feed themselves soon after hatching. They are able to fly well after 25‚Äì34 days. Footnotes References *Handel, C. M., and R. E. Gill (2001). Black Turnstone (Arenaria melanocephala). In The Birds of North America, No. 585 (A.

He was a Confucian scholar who was the most influential Neo-Confucian in China. His contributions to Chinese philosophy including his editing of and commentaries to the Four Books, which later formed the curriculum of the civil service exam in Imperial China from 1313 to 1905; and his emphasis on the process of the \\"investigation of things\\" () and meditation as a method for self cultivation. Zhu has been described as the second most influential thinker in Chinese history, after Confucius himself. He was a scholar with a wide learning in the classics, commentaries, histories and other writings of his predecessors. In his lifetime he was able to serve multiple times as an government official, although he avoided public office for most of his adult life. He also wrote, compiled and edited almost a hundred books and corresponded with dozens of other scholars. He acted as a teacher to groups of students, many of whom chose to study under him for years. He built upon the teachings of the Cheng brothers and others; and further developed their metaphysical theories in regards to principle (l«ê ÁêÜ) and vital force (q√¨ Ê∞£). His followers recorded thousands of his conversations in writing. Life Zhu Xi, whose family originated in Wuyuan County, Huizhou (in modern Jiangxi province), was born in Fujian, where his father worked as the subprefectural sheriff. After his father was forced from office due to his opposition to the government appeasement policy towards the Jurchen in 1140, Zhu Xi received instruction from his father at home. Many anecdotes attest that he was a highly precocious child. It was recorded that at age five he ventured to ask what lay beyond Heaven, and by eight he understood the significance of the Classic of Filiality (Xiaojing). As a youth, he was inspired by Mencius‚Äô proposition that all people could become a sage. Upon his father's death in 1143, he studied with his father's friends Hu Xian, Liu Zihui, and Liu Mianzhi. In 1148, at the age of 19, Zhu Xi passed the Imperial Examination and became a presented scholar (jinshi ). Zhu Xi's first official dispatch position was as Subprefectural Registrar of Tong'an (), which he served from 1153 - 1156. From 1153 he began to study under Li Tong, who followed the Neo-Confucian tradition of Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi, and formally became his student in 1160. In 1179, after not serving in an official capacity since 1156, Zhu Xi was appointed Prefect of Nankang Military District (), where he revived White Deer Grotto Academy.Gardner, pp. 3 - 6 and got demoted three years later for attacking the incompetency and corruption of some influential officials. There were several instances of receiving an appointment and subsequently being demoted. Upon dismissal from his last appointment, he was accused of numerous crimes and a petition was made for his execution. Much of this opposition was headed by Han Tuozhou, the Prime Minister, who was a political rival of Zhu's. Even though his teachings had been severely attacked by establishment figures, almost a thousand brave people attended his funeral.Chan 1963: 588. After the death of Han Tuozhou, Zhu's successor Zhen Dexiu, together with Wei Liaoweng, made Zhu's branch of Neo-Confucianism the dominant philosophy at the Song Court. In 1208, eight years after his death, Emperor Ningzong of Song rehabilitated Zhu Xi and honored him with the posthumous name of Wen Gong (), meaning ‚ÄúVenerable gentleman of culture‚Äù.Chan 1989: 34. Around 1228, Emperor Lizong of Song honored him with the posthumous noble title Duke of (State) Hui ().Chan 1989: 34. Hui refers to Hui-chou his ancestral place in Anhui, now Jiangxi. In 1241, a memorial tablet to Zhu Xi was placed in the Confucian Temple at Qufu,Gardner 1989: 9. thereby elevating him to Confucian sainthood. Today, Zhu Xi is venerated as one of the \\"Twelve Philosophers\\" () of Confucianism. Modern Sinologists and Chinese often refer to him as Zhu Wen Gong () in lieu of his name. Teachings =The Four Books= During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the I Ching like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Analects of Confucius, and the Mencius as the core curriculum for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as the standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations up until 1905,Chan 1963: 589. and education in the classics often began with Zhu Xi's commentaries as the cornerstone for understanding them. The sources of Zhu Xi‚Äòs new approach to the Confucian curriculum have been found in several works of the Cheng brothers. Zhu Xi ‚ÄúcodiÔ¨Åed the Cheng brothers‚Äô teachings and reworked them into his own philosophical program,‚Äù moving ‚Äúfrom philology to philosophy.‚ÄùLianbin Dai, ‚ÄúFrom Philology to Philosophy: Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200) as a Reader-Annotator.‚Äù In Canonical Texts and Scholarly Practices: A Global Comparative Approach, edited by Anthony Grafton and Glenn W. Most, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016, 136‚Äì163 (136). =Vital force (Ê∞£ qi), principle ( ÁêÜ li), and the Supreme Ultimate (Â§™Ê•µ taiji )= Zhu Xi maintained that all things are brought into being by the union of two universal aspects of reality: qi, sometimes translated as vital (or physical, material) force; and li, sometimes translated as rational principle (or law). The source and sum of li is the Taiji (Wade-Giles: T‚Äòai Chi), meaning the Supreme Ultimate. The source of qi (Wade-Giles: ch‚Äòi) is not so clearly stated by Zhu Xi, leading some authorities to maintain that he was a metaphysical monist and others to maintain that he was a metaphysical dualist. According to Zhu Xi's theory, every physical object and every person has its li and therefore has contact in its metaphysical core with the Taiji. What is referred to as the human soul, mind, or spirit is understood as the Taiji, or the supreme creative principle, as it works its way out in a person. Qi and li operate together in mutual dependence. They are mutually aspective in all creatures in the universe. These two aspects are manifested in the creation of substantial entities. When their activity is waxing (rapid or expansive), that is the yang energy mode. When their activity is waning (slow or contractive), that is the yin energy mode. The yang and yin phases constantly interact, each gaining and losing dominance over the other. In the process of the waxing and waning, the alternation of these fundamental vibrations, the so-called five elements (fire, water, wood, metal, and earth) evolve. Zhu Xi argues that li existed even before Heaven and Earth Zhu Xi 1986, Zhuzi yulei, Beijing; Zhonghua Shuju, p.1 In terms of li and qi, Zhu Xi's system strongly resembles Buddhist ideas of ÁêÜ li (again, principle) and ‰∫ã shi (affairs, matters), though Zhu Xi and his followers strongly argued that they were not copying Buddhist ideas. Instead, they held, they were using concepts already present long before in the I Ching. Zhu Xi discussed how he saw the Supreme Ultimate concept to be compatible with principle of Taoism, but his concept of Taiji was different from the understanding of Tao in Daoism. Where Taiji is a differentiating principle that results in the emergence of something new, Dao is still and silent, operating to reduce all things to equality and indistinguishability. He argued that there is a central harmony that is not static or empty but was dynamic, and that the Supreme Ultimate is itself in constant creative activity. =Human nature= Zhu Xi considered the earlier Confucian Xun Zi to be a heretic for departing from Mencius' idea of innate human goodness. Even if people displayed immoral behaviour, the supreme regulative principle was good. The cause of immoral actions is qi. Zhu Xi's metaphysics is that everything contains li and qi. Li is the principle that is in everything and governs the universe. Each person has a perfect li. As such, individuals should act in perfect accordance with morality. However, while li is the underlying structure, qi is also part of everything. Qi obscures our perfect moral nature. The task of moral cultivation is to clear our qi. If our qi is clear and balanced, then we will act in a perfectly moral way. =Heart/mind= Clarity of mind and purity of heart are ideal in Confucian philosophy. In the following poem, \\"Reflections While Reading - 1\\" Zhu Xi illustrates this concept by comparing the mind to a mirror, left covered until needed that simply reflects the world around it, staying clear by the flowing waters symbolizing the Tao. In Chinese, the mind was sometimes called \\"the square inch,\\" which is the literal translation of the term alluded to in the beginning of the poem.Red Pine, Poems of the Masters, Copper Canyon Press, 2003, p. 164. A small square pond an uncovered mirror where sunlight and clouds linger and leave I asked how it stays so clear it said spring water keeps flowing in (translation by Red Pine) =Knowledge and action= According to Zhu Xi's epistemology, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought, and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said \\"Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important.\\"The Complete Works of Chu Hsi, section 20 in Chan 1963: 609. =The investigation of things and the extension of knowledge= Zhu Xi advocated Ê†ºÁâ©Ëá¥Áü• gewu zhizhi, the investigation of things. How to investigate and what these things are is the source of much debate. To Zhu Xi, the things are moral principles and the investigation involves paying attention to everything in both books and affairsThe Complete Works of Chu Hsi, section 26 in Chan 1963: 609. because \\"moral principles are quite inexhaustible\\".The Complete Works of Chu Hsi, section 27 in Chan 1963: 610. =Religion= Zhu Xi did not hold to traditional ideas of God or Heaven (Tian), though he discussed how his own ideas mirrored the traditional concepts. He encouraged an agnostic tendency within Confucianism, because he believed that the Supreme Ultimate was a rational principle, and he discussed it as an intelligent and ordering will behind the universe (while stating that \\"Heaven and Earth have no mind of their own\\" and promoting their only function was to produce things. Whether this can be considered a conscious or intelligent will is clearly up to debate).W.T.Chan Source-Book Zhu Xi, Ch. 11, # 127, pg. 643 He did not promote the worship of spirits and offerings to images. Although he practiced some forms of ancestor worship, he disagreed that the souls of ancestors existed, believing instead that ancestor worship is a form of remembrance and gratitude. =Meditation= Zhu Xi practiced a form of daily meditation called jingzuo similar to, but not the same as, Buddhist dhyana or chan ding (Wade-Giles: ch'an-ting). His meditation did not require the cessation of all thinking as in some forms of Buddhism; rather, it was characterised by quiet introspection that helped to balance various aspects of one's personality and allowed for focused thought and concentration. His form of meditation was by nature Confucian in the sense that it was concerned with morality. His meditation attempted to reason and feel in harmony with the universe. He believed that this type of meditation brought humanity closer together and more into harmony. =On teaching, learning, and the creation of an academy= Tanzhou for reappointment to teach at the imperial court Zhu Xi heavily focused his energy on teaching, claiming that learning is the only way to sage-hood. He wished to make the pursuit of sage-hood attainable to all men. He lamented more modern printing techniques and the proliferation of books that ensued. This, he believed, made students less appreciative and focused on books, simply because there were more books to read than before. Therefore, he attempted to redefine how students should learn and read. In fact, disappointed by local schools in China, he established his own academy, White Deer Grotto Academy, to instruct students properly and in the proper fashion. Taoist and Buddhist influence on Zhu Xi Zhu Xi wrote what was to become the orthodox Confucian interpretation of a number of concepts in Taoism and Buddhism. While he appeared to have adopted some ideas from these competing systems of thought, unlike previous Neo-Confucians he strictly abided by the Confucian doctrine of active moral cultivation. He found Buddhist principles to be darkening and deluding the original mindThe Complete Works of Chu Hsi, section 147 in Chan 1963: 653. as well as destroying human relations.The Complete Works of Chu Hsi, section 138 in Chan 1963: 647. Legacy thumbFrom 1313 to 1905, Zhu Xi's commentaries on the Four Books formed the basis of civil service examinations in China. His teachings were to dominate Neo-Confucians such as Wang Fuzhi, though dissenters would later emerge such as Wang Yangming and the School of Mind two and a half centuries later. His philosophy survived the Intellectual Revolution of 1917, and later Feng Youlan would interpret his conception of li, qi, and taiji into a new metaphysical theory. He was also influential in Japan known as Shushigaku (Êú±Â≠êÂ≠¶, School of Master Zhu), and in Korea known as Jujahak (Ï£ºÏûêÌïô), where it became an orthodoxy. Life magazine ranked Zhu Xi as the forty-fifth most important person in the last millennium. Zhu Xi's descendants, like those of Confucius and other notable Confucians, held the hereditary title of Wujing Boshi (‰∫îÁªèÂçöÂ£´; ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨), which translated means Erudite or Doctor (PhD) of the Five Classics and enjoyed the rank of 8a in the Mandarin (bureaucrat) system. One of his descendants married Emperor Lizong. Calligraphy Zhu Xi had, from an early age, followed his father and a number of great calligraphers at the time in practicing calligraphy. At first he learned the style of Cao Cao, but later specialized in the regular script of Zhong Yao and the running cursive script of Yan Zhenqing. Though his manuscripts left to the world are piecemeal and incomplete, and most of his works are lost. Moreover, his fame in the realm of philosophy was so great that even his brilliance in calligraphy was overshadowed. He was skillful in both running and cursive scripts, especially in large characters, but extant artworks consist mainly of short written notes in running script and rarely of large characters. His authentic manuscripts are collected by Nanjing Museum, Beijing Palace Museum, Liaoning Province Museum, Taipei Palace Museum and the National Museum of Tokyo, Japan. Some pieces are in private collections in China and overseas. The Thatched Hut Hand Scroll, one of Zhu Xi's masterpieces in running-cursive script, is in an overseas private collection. Thatched Hut Hand Scroll Thatched Hut Hand Scroll contains three separate parts: # Title # 102 characters by Zhu Xi in running cursive scripts # The postscripts by Wen Tianxiang (1236ÔΩû1283) of Song dynasty, Fang Xiaoru (1375ÔΩû1402), Zhu Yunming (1460‚Äì1526), Tang Yin (1470ÔΩû1523) and Hai Rui (1514ÔΩû1587) of the Ming dynasty. =Calligraphy style= The calligraphy of Zhu Xi had been acclaimed as acquiring the style of the Han and Wei dynasties. He was skillful in the central tip, and his brush strokes are smooth and round, steady yet flowing in the movements without any trace of frivolity and abruptness. Indeed, his calligraphy possesses stability and elegance in construction with a continuous flow of energy. Without trying to be pretentious or intentional, his written characters are well-balanced, natural and unconventional. As he was a patriarch of Confucianism philosophy, it is understandable that his learning permeated in all his writings with due respect for traditional standards. He maintained that while rules had to be observed for each word, there should be room for tolerance, multiplicity and naturalness. In other words, calligraphy had to observe rules and at the same time not be bound by them so as to express the quality of naturalness. It is small wonder that his calligraphy had been highly esteemed throughout the centuries, by great personages as follows: Tao Chung Yi (around 1329ÔΩû1412) of the Ming dynasty: > Whilst Master Zhu inherited the orthodox teaching and propagated it to the > realm of sages and yet he was also proficient in running and cursive > scripts, especially in large characters. His execution of brush was well- > poised and elegant. However piecemeal or isolated his manuscripts, they were > eagerly sought after and treasured. Wang Sai Ching (1526‚Äì1590) of the Ming dynasty: > The brush strokes in his calligraphy were swift without attempting at > formality, yet none of his strokes and dots were not in conformity with the > rules of calligraphy. Wen Tianxiang of the Song dynasty in his postscript for the Thatched Hut Hand Scroll by Zhu Xi: > People in the olden days said that there was embedded the bones of loyal > subject in the calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing. Observing the execution of brush > strokes by Zhu Xi, I am indeed convinced of the truth of this opinion. Zhu Yunming of the Ming dynasty in his postscript for the Thatched Hut Hand Scroll by Zhu Xi: > Master Zhu was loyal, learned and a great scholar throughout ages . He was > superb in calligraphy although he did not write much in his lifetime and > hence they were rarely seen in later ages. This roll had been collected by > Wong Sze Ma for a long time and of late, it appeared in the world. I chanced > to see it once and whilst I regretted that I did not try to study it > extensively until now, in the study room of my friend, I was so lucky to see > it again. This showed that I am destined to see the manuscripts of master > Zhu. I therefore wrote this preface for my intention. Hai Rui of the Ming dynasty in his postscript for the Thatched Hut Hand Scroll by Zhu Xi: > The writings are enticing, delicate, elegant and outstanding. Truly such > calligraphy piece is the wonder of nature. See also Footnotes and references Further reading *J. Percy Bruce. Chu Hsi and His Masters, Probsthain & Co., London, 1922. *Daniel K. Gardner.

His actions kindled the deadly rivalry between Gaius Marius and Sulla, and provided the pretext for Sulla's unexpected march on Rome. Life =Background and early recorded career= Publius Sulpicius Rufus probably came from the Roman equestrian class, and was born in 124 BC or perhaps the following year. He had close ties to prominent elements of the Roman senatorial aristocracy, and in his youth was tutored in rhetoric and groomed for public life by Lucius Licinius Crassus, a renowned orator and prominent senator. Under his tutelage Sulpicius became one of the most distinguished orators of the time, and, together with two friends and fellow disciples of Crassus ‚Äì Marcus Livius Drusus and Gaius Aurelius Cotta ‚Äì he formed a circle of \\"talented and energetic\\" young nobles in whom the senatorial oligarchy (the self-styled \\"optimates\\" or boni, \\"best men\\") placed significant hope to defend their interests in the near future. The first major event of Sulpicius's public life occurred around 95 BC, when, with support of the boni, he prosecuted a turbulent tribune of the plebs, Gaius Norbanus ‚Äì unsuccessfully, despite Sulpicius's impressive performance on the occasion. Sulpicius continued appearing in more trials in the following years. =Tribunate of Drusus (91 BC)= One historian described Sulpicius and the circle of Crassus as supporters of moderate political reform in a way that strengthened the Roman state and at the same time did not remove control of the state from the established oligarchy. They all agreed between themselves on a program of reform which Crassus's disciples would introduce upon consecutively running for the office of tribune of the plebs, Drusus in 91 BC, Cotta in 90 and Sulpicius 89. Drusus's main objective once in office was the transfer of the state courts from the equestrian class to the Senate directly. He also proposed the extension of Roman citizenship to the Republic's long disenfranchised and dissatisfied Italian allies. Finally, he courted the support of lower classes by promises of land reform and subsidized food. This package, he hoped, would strengthen the old senatorial oligarchy's hold on the state while at the same time satisfying potentially unruly elements in other segments of society, giving the Republic more stability than it had enjoyed in the past generation. Although Drusus's program had the support of many leading senators, he was violently opposed by the equestrians, who stood to lose the most from the proposed reform of the courts. Sulpicius remained a firm supporter of his friend, and attended, together with the rest of the Crassus circle and other political allies, a meeting in September 91 BC at Crassus's villa near Tusculum, to assess the political situation. Crassus himself died shortly afterwards, depriving Drusus of his mentor and chief supporter in the Senate, and severely undermining his cause. Drusus lost popularity as he failed to break the existing political deadlock, and his program ended in failure when he himself was murdered in mysterious circumstances shortly after. Not long after Drusus's death it became clear to Rome's Italian allies that their long-awaited citizenship was not forthcoming. The Italians, having unattended long-standing grievances with regards to their inferior legal status, launched a general uprising in late 91 BC, triggering what contemporaries called the Marsic War. A pro-equestrian tribune of the plebs, Varius, took advantage of the situation by establishing a commission to prosecute Drusus's supporters on the charge that they had \\"incited\\" the Italians to revolt. Sulpicius's friend, Gaius Cotta, who was supposed to succeed Drusus in the tribunate, was forced into exile to avoid condemnation under Varius's court, spelling another setback to the political agenda of the Crassus group. Sulpicius, for his part, narrowly avoided prosecution under the Varian commission, due to military service in the Italian uprising. He served in the war as legatus (deputy), throughout 90 and 89 BC, which forced him to delay his aspired candidacy to the tribunate to the next year. =Marsic War (90‚Äì89 BC)= Although Sulpicius's activities in the Marsic War cannot be reconstructed with any certainty, certain military accomplishments tentatively attributed to him seem to suggest he had a distinguished performance. In 90 BC, Sulpicius and another legate, Pompeius Strabo, found themselves trapped and besieged at Firmum in Picenum, after suffering a defeat at the hands of the Italian insurgents. Upon hearing that the besieging Italians were bringing reinforcements, Pompeius made a sally up front and sent Sulpicius to attack the enemy on the rear. The outcome of the ensuing battle was uncertain until Sulpicius set fire to their camp, which prompted the Italians to retreat. In 89 BC, Pompeius Strabo became consul, and Sulpicius possibly carried on the war on Picenum as his deputy, defeating the insurgent Vestini and Marrucini. By the end of the year, the uprising in northern Italy was all but crushed, and Sulpicius was finally able to return to Rome and oversee his election as tribune, assuming office on 10 December. =Tribunate of Sulpicius (89‚Äì88 BC)= Soon afterwards Sulpicius declared in favour of Gaius Marius and the populares, a move considered to be a surprising volte face by contemporaries: Cicero, for instance, remarks that 'the popular breeze carried Sulpicius, who had set out from an excellent position, further than he wished'Cicero, Har. resp. 43 He was deeply in debt, and it seems that Marius had promised him financial assistance in the event of his being appointed to the command in the Mithridatic Wars, to which Sulla had already been appointed. To secure the appointment for Marius, Sulpicius brought in a franchise bill by which the newly enfranchised Italian allies and freedmen would have swamped the old electors. The majority of the senate were strongly opposed to the proposal; a justitium (cessation of public business) was proclaimed by the consuls, but Marius and Sulpicius fomented a riot, and the consuls, in fear of their lives, withdrew the justitium. The proposals of Sulpicius became law, and, with the assistance of the new voters, the command was bestowed upon Marius, at the time a privatus holding no elected office.For general discussion of Sulpicius' motives, see: J. Powell, 'The tribune Sulpicius', Historia 39 (1990), pp. 446‚Äì60 Sulla, who was then at Nola, immediately marched upon Rome. Marius and Sulpicius, unable to resist him, fled from the city. Marius managed to escape to Africa, but Sulpicius was discovered in a villa at Laurentum and put to death; his head was sent to Sulla and exposed in the forum, and his laws annulled. Sulpicius appears to have been originally a moderate reformer, who by force of circumstances became one of the leaders of a democratic revolt. Although he had impeached the turbulent tribune Gaius Norbanus in 95 BC, and resisted the proposal to repeal judicial sentences by popular decree, he did not hesitate to incur the displeasure of the Julian family by opposing the illegal candidature for the consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo Vopiscus, who had never been praetor and was consequently ineligible.Sources in T.S.R. Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol. 2, pp.41‚Äì2 Sulpicius' franchise proposals, as far as the Italians were concerned, were a necessary measure of justice; but they had been carried by violence. Cicero as a young man went almost daily to see Sulpicius speak as tribune in the Forum (Brutus, 306), and judged him an able orator. Of his skills, Cicero says (Brutus, 55): \\"He was by far the most dignified of all the orators I have heard, and, so to speak, the most tragic; his voice was loud, but at the same time sweet and clear; his gestures were full of grace; his language was rapid and voluble, but not redundant or diffuse; he tried to imitate Crassus, but lacked his charm.\\" Sulpicius left no written speeches, those that bore his name being written by a Publius Canutius. Sulpicius is one of the interlocutors in Cicero‚Äôs De oratore.

It details his very early childhood in Brooklyn, New York, US but focuses primarily on his life in Limerick, Ireland. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's alcoholism. The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. A sequel, 'Tis, was published in 1999, followed by Teacher Man in 2005. Synopsis Born in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is originally from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his \\"odd manner\\" and for telling fantastical stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is often said to closely resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same \\"odd manner.\\" The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child. In America, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and a communal lavatory, with other immigrant families from Ireland, Italy, and the Jewish communities. Frankie has four younger siblings: Malachy, born in 1931, who is often favored over Frankie for being an attractive, open child; blond twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935. The family often struggles with poverty as Malachy Sr. whose endless struggles to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his first week's wages, but eventually he finds himself spending all of his pay in bars, despite Angela's many schemes to prevent him from doing so, and losing his job after a few weeks. Margaret's birth seems to instill new life into the family: the whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He gives up drinking and finds steady work to support the family. However, due to her parents' ignorance of children's disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr abandons his family for days to indulge in an alcoholic binge, while Angela falls into a severe, debilitating depression. Frank, age four, is forced to feed and care for his younger siblings, often with the kind intervention of the neighbors. The neighbors soon realize the family's dire straits and intervene, contacting Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland with Angela's family in Limerick. Angela is pregnant with a new baby as they return to Ireland from America, though she loses the child shortly after moving to Limerick. The Great Depression has struck Ireland, particularly Limerick, even harder than it did the United States. There is little work, and conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it even more difficult to find work because of his Northern Ireland accent and mannerisms, the children are mocked for their American accents, and many neighbors, as well as Angela's family, look down on the McCourts for their return from America. The family is forced to rely on the dole and charity from the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which requires extensive, and humiliating application processes. Angela and Malachy Sr often argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family, and views Angela's asking for charity as begging and degrading. For many years, the family subsists on little more than bread and tea. Within a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die‚ÄîOliver of what is implied to be scarlet fever and Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and pneumonia. After each death, Angela sinks into depression, and the family moves because she cannot bear being in the same house. Each move results in the McCourts sliding down into worse and worse circumstances. Eventually, they end up living in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half a year, requiring the family to live in an upstairs room together. Their house is located next to the only lavatory on the whole street. There is a constant traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the filthy lavatory, which often backs up and smells. Two additional baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and Alphie (Alphonsus, b. 1940), are born in Limerick. Frankie grows up in Limerick as a sensitive and intelligent child. He often makes unique observations from those around him and has an emotional need to help. His strict Catholic upbringing preys on his imaginative nature and thoughts on whether he will be going to hell plague on his mind. Frankie must balance his Catholic beliefs against a church which frequently rejects him due to his poverty and family, his Irish upbringing against his desire to return to America once he's grown, and his desire for his father's attention against his loyalty to his mother. Strangers often prefer his more attractive and outgoing siblings, but Frankie wins over a few champions, mainly in the form of his school teachers and the various adults who hire him for odd jobs. Frank develops typhoid fever and is taken to a Catholic hospital, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, and access to limitless books, and the time to read them, giving birth to his lifelong love of literature. Frankie additionally contracts chronic conjunctivitis, which does little to improve his looks or perceived, sarcastic demeanor. At the outbreak of World War II, many Limerick men find work at a defence plant in Coventry, England, leaving their families behind and sending back money to support them. These good-paying jobs lift many of the McCourts' neighbors out of poverty. Malachy Sr leaves the family behind and secures a defence job. For several weeks, the payments allow the family to enjoy small luxuries such as candy and visits to the movies. But soon, the money stops coming and Malachy Sr abandons his family for good. Frank and his brothers begin to scavenge the streets for coal or peat turf for fuel. They also steal leftover food from restaurants at the end of the day and grocery deliveries from doorsteps. Eventually, the family is evicted and homeless. With few options, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin. Laman is a petty tyrant who resents the presence of the children and enjoys degrading them and Angela. A preteen Frankie resents this treatment, but puts up with it for his mother and younger brothers. Upon discovering that part of Laman's deal for providing housing is a sexual relationship with Angela, Frankie has a fight with Laman and is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the military as a bugle boy. Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, who was dropped on his head as a child and now lives in the house left to him by his deceased mother. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and begins to support himself while saving for his passage to America. The interesting people and situations Frankie meets on his deliveries cause him to grow as a person. Frankie supports his youngest brothers by providing food and respite from Laman Griffin when they come to visit him. Eventually, his brothers ask if they can move in with him, which he allows, and they are shortly followed by Angela. Frankie must now turn over the majority of his wages to his mother as the bread winner of the family, though he still takes on various odd jobs to earn extra for his ticket to America, such as writing threatening collection letters on behalf of a local moneylender. On his sixteenth birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and returns home, singing like his father used to. When his mother shames him for drinking the way his father did, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and is immediately ashamed of himself. One day Frank returns to the moneylender's home to find she has died. Liberated, Frank takes money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. The contents of the moneylender's purse give him enough money to return to America at the age of nineteen. Frank arrives in Poughkeepsie, New York, ready to begin a new life in the country of his birth. Character list McCourt family * Francis McCourt: The writer of the book and main character.

Disputed memories McCourt was accused of exaggerating his family's impoverished upbringing by many Limerick natives, including Richard Harris. McCourt's mother denied the accuracy of his stories shortly before her death in 1981, walking out of a stage performance by her two elder sons; Malachy's recollection is that she said it was \\"all a pack of lies.\\" Local writer and filmmaker Gerry Hannan has compiled a list of 117 inaccuracies in Angela's Ashes, most notably that McCourt claims that Willie Harrold charged people to watch his sisters undressing, but Harrold had no sisters; that McCourt's claim to have had a sexual relationship with Teresa Carmody tarnishes the name of a girl who died young; that McCount never worked as a telegraph boy; and that the McCourts never lived with Laman (Gerry) Griffin. McCourt is accused of hating the \\"pillars\\" of Limerick city, especially the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Church and Munster Rugby. Hannan confronted McCourt on The Late Late Show in 1999. Paddy Malone, who appears on the book's cover in a school photograph, has said, \\"McCourt calls this book a memoir, but it is filled with lies and exaggerations. The McCourts were never that poor.\\" For example, McCourt was a member of the Boy Scouts, a middle-class pursuit the poor could not afford, and family photographs show the children and Angela as well-fed. American journalist Mike Meyer visited Limerick and took the tour of the city sparked by publication of the book. He realized how much the city had changed since McCourt's childhood years, including destruction of the slum area where his family lived when Frank was in school. McCourt described the book as \\"a memoir, not an exact history\\", and admitted to fabricating the story about Willie Harrold's sister. Similarly, Alan Parker, who directed the film version, said that Angela's Ashes \\"was a work of art which met Gore Vidal's definition of autobiography, being an 'impression' of a life, rather than a memoir.\\" Film In 1999 a film version was released. It was co- written and directed by Alan Parker starring Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, and Michael Legge, as the Young, Middle and Older Frank McCourt respectively and Emily Watson as McCourt's mother Angela, Robert Carlyle as the father. The film begins when the McCourt family move back to Ireland after experiencing hardship in America. Many of the Street scenes were filmed in Cork, Ireland. The film soundtrack was composed and conducted by John Williams, and features songs by Billie Holiday and Sin√©ad O'Connor. Musical A stage musical adaptation of Angela's Ashes by Adam Howell (Music & Lyrics) and Paul Hurt (Book) received its world premiere at the Lime Tree Theatre, Limerick on July 6, 2017 with following performances at the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre, Dublin and the Grand Opera House, Belfast.

It flows south-west from the southern Tararua Range for , forming a number of fertile floodplains, including Kaitoke, central Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt. Course The headwaters in the Kaitoke Regional Park are closed to preserve the quality of the drinking water drawn off at Kaitoke to supply the greater Wellington area. Below Kaitoke is the Kaitoke Gorge, a popular destination for rafting. Below the gorge is Te MƒÅrua, where the Mangaroa River joins the Hutt from the east. Further down, at Birchville, the Akatarawa River joins the Hutt from the west. Here it flows in a deep channel between the surrounding hills and is turned to flow across the Wellington Fault to Maoribank. The movement of the fault can be seen from the displacement of the river terraces in Harcourt Park.Noticeboard in Harcourt Park, Upper Hutt. At the top of the Upper Hutt floodplain, the river makes a sharp turn against the bedrock at the foot of the cliff at Maoribank to flow down the valley. The Upper Hutt floodplain contains the greater portion of Upper Hutt city. The Whakatiki River joins the Hutt from the west and it is about this point the river starts to flow along the virtually straight Wellington geologic fault, which lies on the western side of the river valley. At the lower end of the Upper Hutt floodplain is Taita Gorge, which separates Upper Hutt from Lower Hutt; this gorge is significantly shorter and less constricting than Kaitoke Gorge. The river's outflow, at Petone, is into Wellington Harbour. The geological fault that the river previously followed continues as a steep bluff at the edge of the Wellington Harbour. State Highway 2 follows the course of the river for most of its length, with the exception of the Kaitoke Gorge and the head waters, before crossing the Remutaka Range into the Wairarapa. =Bridges= Heading downstream: *Kaitoke Swingbridges, 2 footbridges in Kaitoke Regional Park. *Te MƒÅrua Bridge (demolished) *Akatarawa Road Bridge, a two-lane road bridge opened in 1981 to replace a single-lane road bridge opened in 1915 and demolished in 1982. Abutments of the old bridge remain in the adjacent downstream riverbank and a pier footing remains in the river bed. *Akatarawa Bridge, the old Hutt County Council wooden truss bridge that crossed the river near the intersection of Rata Street and Birch Terrace with Akatarawa Road. Constructed in 1880-81 and closed in 1953. Piers damaged by flooding and then demolished and removed from riverbed in 1998. *Hutt Borough Council Pipe Bridge constructed adjacent to the Akatarawa Bridge in 1913 to carry the Hutt Borough Council water supply pipes until decommissioned in 1958. Also damaged by flooding and demolished in 1998 at the same time as the Akatarawa Bridge. *Norbert Street Footbridge between California Park in Totara Park and Harcourt Park at the end of Norbert Street in Birchville. *Maoribank Suspension Bridge (1917 to 1998) Crossed at the bend in the river at the foot of Maoribank cliff. Cliffside pier damaged by flooding in 1998, making bridge unsafe, so bridge was demolished. *Totara Park Bridge (Totara Park Road), a two-lane road bridge opened c. 1970, providing access to the suburb of Totara Park. *Moonshine Bridge (River Road/SH 2), a curved two-lane road bridge that was opened in 1987 as part of the River Road bypass of Upper Hutt. It replaced a road bridge slightly upstream of the current bridge. *Silverstream Road Bridge (Fergusson Drive): a two-lane road bridge. It also carries a bulk water supply pipe, underslung on the north side, connecting Te MƒÅrua water treatment plant with Porirua and Wellington City. *Silverstream Rail Bridge (Wairarapa Line): a double-track rail bridge that was opened in 1954 to replace the 1875 single- track rail bridge around 500 metres further downstream. *Pomare Rail Bridge (Wairarapa Line): a double-track rail bridge that was opened in 1954 as part of the Hutt Valley railway deviation. *Kennedy-Good Bridge (Fairway Drive): a two-lane road bridge that was opened in 1979 and was the first bridge at this site. The bridge is named after the Mayor of Lower Hutt at the time. *Melling Bridge (Melling Link Road): a three-lane bridge (one eastbound, two westbound) that was opened 1957. This is the second bridge at this site, the first being a one-lane suspension bridge opened in 1909, approximately 200 metres upstream. *(New) Ewen Bridge: this single span arch bridge carrying four traffic lanes of traffic and footways is the seventh bridge at this site and was opened in 1996. The preceding bridges, which crossed nearer to Bridge Street, upstream of the latest bridge, were opened in 1844, 1847, 1856, 1872, 1904 and 1929. *The 'Rail Bridge' (Wairarapa Line) a two-track rail bridge with pedestrian walkway. Opened 1927 with the then Hutt Valley branch line to Waterloo *Estuary Bridge (Waione Street): a two-lane road bridge that also carries a bulk water supply pipe connecting Waterloo and Wainuiomata water treatment plants with Wellington City. Opened 1954. Description and recreation A view across Wellington Harbour looking towards the mouth of the Hutt River For most of its length, the Hutt is a shallow and sometimes braided river in a wide rocky bed, but in the Kaitoke gorge the river flows directly over bedrock, and approaching the mouth at Petone the river is narrower and the banks steeper. The larger populated areas in Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt are protected from flooding by stopbanks and introduced willow trees, as is common in New Zealand. The regular flooding of Lower Hutt resulted in highly fertile land and prior to the building of state housing by the first Labour Government starting in 1937, there were many market gardens in Lower Hutt. The Hutt has moved significantly since European settlement, due to a major earthquake in 1855 that raised the riverbed. The river can be walked or cycled from Upper Hutt to Petone along tracks on either side, though the eastern bank is more accessible. The Lower Hutt edition of Parkrun, the worldwide weekly running series, runs along the last section of the Hutt River from just north of the Ewen Bridge down to the Waione Bridge and back. Naming The official name since 2011 is Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River. Early MƒÅori residents, such as NgƒÅi Tara, called it Te Awa Kairangi. Later MƒÅori settlers named it Te Wai o Orutu after Orutu, a NgƒÅti Mamoe ancestor. By the time European settlers arrived, MƒÅori called it Heretaunga, a name adopted by an Upper Hutt suburb and secondary school. The river was named Hutt after Sir William Hutt, chairman of the New Zealand Company. This name was given by Captain Edward Main Chaffers and Colonel William Wakefield while charting Port Nicholson in 1839. Ecology The river has a good stock of brown trout.

The character was created by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp as a \\"mirror image\\" of Superman and first appeared in Superboy #68 (1958). Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books (1956 ‚Äì c. 1970), the character has often been portrayed as an antagonist to Superman, though on occasion he also takes on an anti-hero role, and appeared in both comic books and graphic novels as well as other DC Comics-related products such as animated and live-action television series, trading cards, toys, and video games. Publication history Bizarro debuted in Superboy #68 (cover- dated October 1958, but on sale in August), writer Otto Binder casting the character as a Frankenstein's monster pastiche that possessed all the powers of Superboy. Shunned for his unenviable appearance, the teen version of Bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story. An adult version appeared around the same time in the Superman daily newspaper comic strip written by Alvin Schwartz, debuting in Episode 105: \\"The Battle With Bizarro\\" (strips 6147‚Äì6242: August 25, 1958 to December 13, 1958). According to comics historian Mark Evanier, Schwartz long claimed that he originated the Bizarro concept prior to the character's appearance in Superboy. The newspaper storyline introduced the strange speech patterns that became synonymous with the character, with all of Bizarro's comments meaning the opposite (e.g. \\"bad\\" means \\"good\\"). The newspaper version wore a \\"B\\" on his chest, as opposed to Superman's distinctive \\"S\\". Schwartz stated:Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004. Binder introduced the adult version of the character into the Superman comic book, this time wearing an \\"S\\", in Action Comics #254 (July 1959). Bizarro proved popular, and eventually starred in a Bizarro World feature in Adventure Comics for fifteen issues, running from issue #285‚Äì299 (June 1961 ‚Äì August 1962),This material has been collected as Superman: Tales of the Bizarro World, DC Comics, 2000 (). as well as in a special all-Bizarro 80-Page Giant (Superman #202, December 1967/January 1968). The character made forty appearances in the Superman family of titlesAction Comics, Superman, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, Adventure Comics, Secret Society of Super Villains, and DC Comics Presentsfrom 1959 to 1984, prior to a reboot of the DC Universe as a result of the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths #1‚Äì12 (April 1985 ‚Äì March 1986). Bizarro was reintroduced into the DC Universe in a one-off appearance with characterization similar to his original Superboy appearance in The Man of Steel #5 (December 1986). He was later revived in the \\"Bizarro's World\\" serial that ran through the Superman titles in March and April 1994, and in Action Comics Annual #8 in 1996. An unrelated four-issue limited series titled A. Bizarro (July‚ÄìOctober) was published in 1999. Yet another version was introduced during the \\"Emperor Joker\\" storyline in September‚ÄìOctober 2000. Remaining in DC Comics continuity, this Bizarro continued to make semi-regular guest appearances that firmly established the character as part of the Superman mythos. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis Bizarro= General Dru-Zod had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet Krypton. The bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun, but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation. This was the reason why Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for 25 Krypton sun-cycles.Phantom Zone #1 (January 1982) Some 12 years later, totally oblivious to these facts, a scientist on the Earth is demonstrating his newly invented \\"duplicating ray\\" to Superboy, and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero. The copy, quickly labeled \\"Bizarro\\", is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Shunned by the people of Smallville, Bizarro befriends a blind girl, and loses all hope when he realizes that the girl did not shun or flee from him because she was blind. Superboy is eventually forced to \\"kill\\" the \\"less than perfect\\" clone, using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like blue kryptonite (as opposed to green kryptonite, Superboy's weakness) on the copy.Superboy (vol. 1) #68 (November 1958) The whole business proved unexpectedly easy as Bizarro deliberately destroyed himself by colliding with the duplicating machine's fragment. The ensuing explosion miraculously restores the girl's eyesight. Years afterward, Superman's arch-foe Lex Luthor recreates the \\"duplicating ray\\" and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate. The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating: \\"Me not human... me not creature... me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't belong in world of living people! Me don't know difference between right and wronggood and evil!\\" Luthor is arrested by Bizarro for re-creating him, but forgotten as Bizarro attempts to emulate Superman, creating havoc in the city of Metropolis and almost exposing Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent. When Bizarro falls in love with reporter Lois Lane, she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a \\"Bizarro Lois\\", who is instantly attracted to Bizarro. The Bizarros leave Earth together, determined to find a home where they can be themselves.Action Comics (vol. 1) #254‚Äì255 (July‚ÄìAugust 1959) Superman encounters the couple once again, discovering that Bizarronow called Bizarro #1has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of Bizarros, who now reside on a cube-shaped planet called \\"Htrae\\" (Earth spelled backwards).Action Comics (vol. 1) #263‚Äì264 (April‚ÄìMay 1960) Bizarro #1 and Bizarro-Lois #1 also give birth to a child who, while super-powered, appears to be totally human. Considered a freak by Bizarro standards (out of resentment for the way he was treated by Earth humans, Bizarro #1 made a law that they must act the opposite of humans, causing no end of lunacy), the child is the catalyst for a brief war between Htrae and Earth.Superman (vol. 1) #140 (October 1960) Blue Kryptonite is also invented during this war, as well as the temporary existence of Bizarro-Supergirl. Bizarro also has a series of adventures on Htrae, aiding a normal Jimmy Olsen when he is accidentally trapped there,Adventure Comics #287 (June 1961) preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues,Adventure Comics #290 (November 1961) and stopping the Bizarro version of Titano.Adventure Comics #295 (April 1962) Bizarro's influence is also felt on Earth: Jimmy Olsen is inadvertently turned into a Bizarro for a while,Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #80 (October 1964) and a new teen version of Bizarro travels to the 30th century and attempts to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. When he is rejected by the Legion, the Bizarro teen creates his own Bizarro version of the Legion, which Superboy eventually persuades him to disband.Adventure Comics #329 (February 1965) When Bizarro encounters Superman once again, his powers are now the opposite of Superman's (such as freeze vision as opposed to heat vision and heat breath rather than freeze breath), and he attempts to kidnap Lois Lane.Superman (vol. 1) #306 (December 1976); Superman (vol. 1) #333 (March 1979) Bizarro also temporarily joins the Secret Society of Super Villains to battle the Justice League of America and Captain Comet.Secret Society of Super Villains Special #1 (January 1977)Secret Society of Super Villains #10 (October 1977) Bizarro appears in the Alan Moore-scripted \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\", in Superman #423 (September 1986). Bizarro goes berserk and destroys the Bizarro World and its inhabitants, then travels to Metropolis and wreaks havoc before abruptly committing suicide. This and many other deaths turn out to be the machinations of Mister Mxyzptlk, who had begun a rampage of crime. Superman is unable to undo the deaths, but kills Mxyzptlk and then uses gold kryptonite on himself. Bizarro's final pre-Crisis appearance was in DC Comics Presents #97 (September 1986), which was also the final issue of that series. After being empowered by a hideously disfigured Phantom Zone sorcerer, Mr. Mxyzptlk destroys Zrfff and then causes the Bizarro world to implode, killing all its inhabitants. Bizarro's severed head crashes onto Clark Kent's desk and addresses Clark Kent before his simulated life ends. Bizarro does not appear in the Crisis on Infinite Earths, apparently because of this story's events. This story directly contradicts a World's Finest story where it is revealed that sometime in the future, Htrae is transformed into a more normal world (egg-shaped rather than cubical) by the radiation from an exploding celestial body. The Bizarros are changed into normal people without powers, but still retain vestiges of their Bizarro laws (curtains hung outside the windows of a house, etc.).World's Finest Comics #181 (December 1968) =Post-Crisis= After the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Lex Luthor orders his scientific team to create a clone of Superman. Incorrectly starting from the assumption that Superman is a human with metahuman abilities (his alien origin had not yet been revealed), the process results in a flawed copy, which Luthor dismissively refers to as \\"...this bizarreOh, forget it\\", before ordering for the subject to be disposed of. The clone survives and, although mute and possessed of only limited intelligence and vague memories of Clark Kent's life, attempts to mimic Superman. He kidnaps Lois Lane and is finally destroyed when colliding with Superman in mid-air.Man of Steel #5 (December 1986) Each time he exerted himself, the clone crumbled slightly. When Lois Lane's sister, who had been blinded in a terrorist attack, is exposed to Bizarro's dust, she regains her sight. While Superman had not expected this effect, he speculated that Bizarro heard the sister explain her partial recovery and may have deliberately allowed himself to be killed in order to cure her. A second Bizarro, able to speak and think better due to genetic engineering by Luthor, appears in a 5-issue substory in the clone plague story-arc titled \\"Bizarro's World\\" (beginning in Superman #87). Before he died, this Bizarro seriously injured Happersen, kidnapped Lois, created a ramshackle dummy version of Metropolis in a warehouse (to parody Superman's frequently rescuing Lois, he deliberately exposed her to and \\"rescued\\" her from one lethal danger after another), abducted Lana Lang, proposed to Lois and finally died in Luthor's labs.Superman #88 During this period, Superman also had to cope with an unending increase in his powers due to exposure to \\"purple kryptonite\\" in the climax of the Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen story-arcs.This material was collected as Superman: Bizarro's World, DC Comics, 1996 () One other Bizarro is created using Lex Luthor's clone process, by Lex Luthor's estranged wife and Dabney Donovan shortly after Superman regained his normal powers when he expended his electromagnetic ones. This Bizarro abducted Lex Luthor's baby daughter and intended to send her by rocket to another planet, emulating Kal-El's escape from Krypton. His pile of explosives and bombs, meant to launch the rocket, would have killed her instead, and Superman had to shield her when Bizarro threw the launch switch. Bizarro 2, already self-destructing from a genetic booby trap encoded into him by his creator, perished in the explosion.Superman Forever #1 (June 1998) Another version of Bizarro possesses all the abilities of Superman but with a childlike mentality and method of speech. He is created by Batman's arch-enemy the Joker when the villain steals the powers of the fifth-dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk. Creating a twisted version of Earth called \\"Jokerworld\\"a perfect cube with Joker's image on each facetthe villain designates Bizarro to be the planet's greatest hero and leader of a reimagined \\"JLA\\" (the \\"Joker's League of Anarchy\\"). When Mxyzptlk regains his powers, the imp allows Bizarro and several other beings to remain on the restored Earth.Action Comics (vol. 1) #769‚Äì770 (September‚ÄìOctober 2000)Adventures of Superman #582‚Äì583 (September‚ÄìOctober 2000)Superman (vol. 1) #160‚Äì161 (September‚ÄìOctober 2000)Superman: The Man of Steel #104‚Äì105 (September‚ÄìOctober 2000)Superman: Emperor Joker #1 (October 2000) Bizarro suffers a setback when captured by the Pokolistanian dictator General Zod. Zod beats and tortures Bizarro, simply because the creature resembles Superman. The hero rescues Bizarro, and to help him adjust to the normal Earth rebuilds Bizarro's \\"Graveyard of Solitude\\" (the opposite of Superman's Fortress of Solitude).Action Comics (vol. 1) #785 (January 2002) During the Infinite Crisis, Bizarro is tricked into joining the reformed Secret Society of Super Villains by Flash's foe Zoom. In a battle with superteam the Freedom Fighters Bizarro accidentally kills the Human Bomb, repeatedly hitting the hero to see the flashes of light that are produced from the kinetic energy of the blows.Infinite Crisis #1 (October 2005) Bizarro becomes involved when Kryptonian criminals, led by General Zod, escape to Earth.Action Comics (vol. 1) #844‚Äì846 (December 2006 ‚Äì February 2007) Wishing to create a home for himself, Bizarro travels into deep space to a solar system occupied by a blue sun. After creating a cube shaped planet, filled with distorted versions of various buildings and locations on Earth, Bizarro is still lonely. The blue sun, however, gives Bizarro a new ability called \\"Bizarro Vision\\", which allows him to create new Bizarros. When this fails, Bizarro kidnaps Jonathan Kent, Superman's adopted father on Earth. Superman rescues his father and helps Bizarro become his world's greatest hero.Action Comics (vol. 1) #855‚Äì857 (October‚ÄìDecember 2007) Bizarro eventually appears on the planet Throneworld, befriending and aiding Earth hero Adam Strange and allies Prince Gavyn, Captain Comet, and the Weird. Together they participate in the war between alien worlds Rann and Thanagar,Rann/Thanagar Holy War #1‚Äì8 (July 2008 ‚Äì February 2009) and against villains Lady Styx and Synnar.Strange Adventures #1-8 (May‚ÄìDecember 2009) Bizarro eventually visits the grave of a deceased Jonathan Kent, and is then sent (by rogue Kryptonians) with other Superman foes to the inter-dimensional prison, the Phantom Zone.Superman (vol. 1) #682 (January 2009) Bizarro has a series of encounters with former Secret Society ally Solomon Grundy,Solomon Grundy #1‚Äì8 (May‚ÄìNovember 2009) and during the events of Blackest Night, Bizarro confronts the Black Lantern version of Grundy.

Dr. Light attempts to take the Bizarro Supergirl to S.T.A.R. Labs, only to be violently knocked unconscious by Supergirl, who then absconds with her doppelganger and her ship, hoping to stop the Godship and save Bizarro World.Supergirl (vol. 5) #55 (August 2010) After taking Bizarro Supergirl back to Bizarro World, Bizarro Superman is reunited with Bizarro Supergirl.Supergirl (vol. 5) #56 (September 2010) =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Bizarro first appears in the Forever Evil event. Five years ago, Lex Luthor, intending to create his personal army of Supermen, attempted to splice Superman's DNA with human DNA and injected it into a teenage test subject. Instead, he transforms into a hulking white-skinned monster with cryonic vision, incendiary breath, and immunity to Kryptonitededucing his weakness, Luthor hits him with concentrated solar radiation that oversaturates his cells and kills him. Luthor then takes samples of the creature to continue his experiment, deciding to clone a purely Kryptonian body. Five years later, a capsule labeled B-0 is shown.Superman vol. 3 #23.1 After the Crime Syndicate takes over the world, Luthor releases Subject B-0, though his transformation is only halfway through. When he kills a security guard named Otis on Luthor's orders, Luthor is pleased and decides to use the imperfect clone in his plan to take the Syndicate down.\\"Forever Evil\\" #2 Later, when Luthor and his team of villains pass through a tunnel, B-0 is revealed to be afraid of darkness. Luthor tries to comfort him with a story about his own fears, but ultimately wonders whether the clone was a waste of time; B-0 then speaks his first words, \\"Bizarro... try\\", much to Luthor's surprise.\\"Forever Evil\\" #3 Though initially doubtful, Luthor grows truly fond of \\"Bizarro\\", who proves to be a powerful asset throughout the event. During the final confrontation against the Earth-3 invaders, Bizarro battles Mazahs, the alternate version of Luthor himself; although he initially has the upper hand, Bizarro is fatally wounded and left to die. Luthor desperately tries to fix him, to no avail, and they share a sorrowful goodbye. Enraged over the death of Bizarro, Lex Luthor murders his Earth-3 counterpart, avenging Bizarro. After the battle is over, Luthor restarts the cloning process; when one of his scientists states it should take about ten years to fully develop a perfect Kryptonian clone, Luthor corrects him by saying it will take only five years, revealing he truly intends to create a perfect copy of Bizarro.\\"Forever Evil\\" #7 =DC Rebirth= In the \\"DC Rebirth\\" reboot, a clone of Bizarro is found inside of a tube in a train car stolen by Black Mask sometime after the Crime Syndicate of America incident. Red Hood and Artemis jump aboard the train car attempting to steal a weapon, not expecting it to be a clone of Superman. Bizarro eventually joins Red Hood's Outlaws.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 2 #2 During this time, Bizarro is stricken with a sickness which causes his cells to rapidly deteriorate. After saving his teammates in the Outlaws, he dies. Lex Luthor takes his body to try to resurrect him, on the condition that he be the property of Lexcorp. This results in Bizarro becoming extremely smart, surprising his teammates. Powers and abilities Bizarro is depicted as having all the abilities of Superman, although these traits are reversed, such as, * \\"freeze vision\\" instead of heat vision * \\"flame breath\\" instead of freeze breath * \\"vacuum breath\\" instead of super breath * \\"Bizarro telescopic vision\\" which allows Bizarro to see a \\"short distance behind his head\\" rather than a \\"long distance in front of his head\\" * \\"Bizarro microscopic vision\\" which makes objects \\"actually smaller to everyone\\" rather than merely \\"appear to be bigger to only the user\\" * \\"Bizarro X-ray vision\\" which allows Bizarro to \\"only see through lead\\" rather than the ability to \\"see through anything except lead\\" * \\"Telescopic X-ray vision\\" which caused Bizarro to shoot x-rays from his eyes from \\"fifty miles around\\".Superman: Red Son #1 This also applies to weaknesses, as Bizarro is vulnerable to blue kryptonite, as opposed to green kryptonite, which is lethal to Superman. Bizarro is actually strengthened by green kryptonite as opposed to blue kryptonite. Other versions =All-Star Superman= The limited series All-Star Superman (January 2006 ‚Äì October 2008) features Bizarro clones from an alternative universe called the \\"Underverse\\". They can \\"infect\\" a normal human and change them into a Bizarro clone by touch.All Star Superman #2 One of these creatures is called \\"Zibarro\\" and is unique in that he has intellect and a roughly human appearance, traits which he considered to be sources of scorn from his fellow Bizarros, resulting in a social isolation and loneliness he attempted to combat through artwork. When Superman was stranded in the Underverse, Zibarro helped him marshal the other Bizarros into building a rocketship that could send Kal-El home - Zibarro briefly considered taking Superman's place in the rocket, but realized he had no way of knowing he would find any more acceptance among humans than his kinsmen. Before leaving, Superman advised him that rather than an aberration, Zibarro may be evidence of increasing intelligence on the part of Bizarro-Home, and encouraged him to keep up his work; Superman had a segment of Zibarro's poetry preserved in Superlaminite within his Fortress of Solitude after returning home.All Star Superman #7‚Äì8 =Amalgam Comics= An amalgamation of Bizarro and Carnage, Bizarnage was made through a botched experiment at Project Cadmus in an attempt to replicate alien DNA. The white, goopy creature they created went crazy and began destroying everything and everyone in its way. Then Spider-Boy arrived and battled him. Bizarnage wanted to be Spider-Boy, so he tried insanely to kill him, but was eventually defeated by getting tricked by Spider-Boy and sucked into an energy containment unit. =Superboy Comics= Bizarro appears in an issue of the tie-in comic for the late-1980s Superboy TV show, in which he is duped into acting as a student's art project.Superboy: The Comic Book #8 (September 1990) He also was featured in an issue of the Superman Adventures comic series that tied into Superman: The Animated Series in which he is brought to Earth by Lobo.Superman Adventures #29 (March 1999) =Adventure Comics= A Bizarro fantasy akin to the pre-Crisis version appears in the 1998 Adventure Comics 80-Page Giant by writer Tom Peyer and artist Kevin O'Neill. There, Bizarro demands that a technician at a SETI-like installation broadcast his diary. Having no choice, the technician looks over the diary, which tells the story of the classic cube-shaped backwards Bizarro World. Superman accidentally finds himself there and, to allay people's fears of him, goes on a \\"constructive rampage.\\" The original Bizarro, a.k.a. Bizarro #1, goes to Earth and attempts to stop Superman with the help of his friends. However, when the other Bizarros try to kill Superman, #1 stops them, saying that killing is the earthly thing that they must, above all, do the opposite of. Realizing that, however strange the Bizarro World might be, its inhabitants are safer and happier than those of Earth thanks to Bizarro #1's leadership, Superman apologizes. To show his sincerity he hides a copy of the Bizarro Code where nobody will ever see it. The people hold a parade in #1's honor and with his loving wife Bizarro Lois #1 and their son, Bizarro Junior #1 at his side, Bizarro cries saying \\"Me am ... happiest creature in universe.\\" When the technician finishes reading the story, he sees Bizarro is gone and, horrified, asks ‚Äì what if the journal itself is no exception to the Bizarro Code? Elsewhere, the truth is revealed; Bizarro, who has no home and no family and is held in contempt by Superman, weeps because he is the most miserable creature in the universe. =Earth-Two Pre-Crisis= In Superman Family #219, Superman encountered an animated lifeless version of his Flying Tiger alter ego, which he used the previous issue to fabricate a criminal career in order to track down the supplier of Kryptonite to various crooks. Ascertaining that this Flying Tiger was an enlarged 3-dimensional version of a picture drawn of him in the Daily Star, Superman ensnared this Tiger in a trap whereby the demented duplicate was crippled by Kryptonite radiation. Superman realized that this Flying Tiger not only had his abilities but also his weaknesses, and after defeating him he tracked down his creator, Funny Face. Although Funny Face transformed Lois Lane Kent into a 2-dimensional drawing, as he had done years earlier, Superman was able to restore her to normal and transform the fake Flying Tiger back into a drawing on a page. =Trinity= In the 2004 graphic novel mini-series Trinity by Matt Wagner, Bizarro is a genetic clone of Superman that is the result of Luthorcorp's \\"Project Replica\\". The creature was then sealed away in the frozen wasteland of Antarctica, encased within ice, until it was released by Ra's al Ghul, who used him as a pawn in his plan to use nuclear warheads to decimate Gotham as well as destroy a cluster of communication satellites, causing a major communications blackout, the end goal of his mission being to incite chaos and purge the Earth of the \\"cancer\\" that is civilization. After he is injured by Batman's use of a suit of armour and solar pulse lasers, Bizarro's hand is removed by Superman's heat vision before his template throws him into a volcano. This Bizarro is presumably deceased, however, his hand is turned into red kryptonite at the bottom of the ocean.Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity #1‚Äì3 =Adventures of Superman= A story in the out-of-continuity digital-first anthology comic book Adventures of Superman from 2013 by Christos Gage and Eduardo Francisco reveals that Bizarro's penchant for opposites comes as a result of his imperfectly formed brain, a discovery which allows Superman and Professor Hamilton to make him talk and think like a regular person and pursue his desire to be heroic.In the digital numbering, this story is serialized in Adventures of Superman #25‚Äì27; in print it is the single-issue Adventures of Superman #9. =Bizarro Comics= The 2002 graphic novel Bizarro Comics is an anthology of short comics by artists of the independent scene handling various DC Comics characters in humorous tales set outside of any continuity. All the stories are bookended by Bizarro Wars, a comic written by Chris Duffy with art by Stephen DeStefano in which Mxyzptlk seeks the aid of Superman to save the fifth dimension from a cosmic conqueror named \\"A\\", but ends up with Bizarro (here introduced as a new character that neither Superman nor Mxyzptlk formerly knew of) instead. The other comics in the volume (including one short Bizarro World story written by Bizarro creator Alvin Schwartz) are presented as creations of the deranged mind of Bizarro himself.The \\"Bizarro Comics\\" anthology at dccomics.com The 2005 follow-up anthology Bizarro World features the character less centrally, but includes an introductory story in which the character runs an amusement park. =Earth 2= On Earth 2 as part of The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Darkseid and Steppenwolf created a clone of Superman which they dub Brutaal.Earth 2 #16 After being snapped out of Darkseid's control by his wife Lois Lane (who in this reality inhabits the wind-manipulating robot body known as Red Tornado), Superman and Red Tornado leave for the Kent Family's farm.Earth 2 #23 After a protracted battle with Earth 2's superheroes, in particular Green Lantern (Alan Scott) and a younger Kryptonian named Val-Zod, he is revealed to be scaling and decomposing. Realizing he is a Bizarro-type clone and that his power is waning, the Superman clone is destroyed by Lois using a cyclone blast from her hand.Earth 2 #26 =Red Son= In Superman: Red Son, Lex Luthor chose to create his own version of Superman through cloning to combat and overcome the original. Luthor decided to crash Sputnik into Metropolis which will bring Superman to the event and hopefully allow Luthor to gather genetic material of Superman. As planned, Superman arrived in time to stop the deadly crash. The United States government claims the probe and Luthor obtained the samples he needs in order to create his copy which proves to be defective and was named \\"Superman 2.\\" Luthor sent Superman 2 off to engage Superman who was attending a state party which Wonder Woman was also attending. Superman 2 clashed with Superman over the English Channel and the two fight. Their battle was so aggressive it accidentally caused an American nuclear missile to launch. Superman 2 proves himself to be a true genetic descendant of Superman as he sacrificed himself to save millions from the nuclear explosion. =Justice= In Justice, Bizarro was created by Lex Luthor, in an attempt to use early cloning technology to find a means to kill Superman. The results were less than perfect. Once fashioned, even Luthor was incapable of controlling Superman's would-be duplicate. He is shown to have freeze vision, heat breath, and loves creating destruction, but isn't as intelligent as Superman and is a member of the Legion of Doom. He's based on the Silver Age version of Bizarro. =Miscellaneous versions= Several alternative universe versions of the character exist: A Legends of the Dead Earth story set in the far future features a former media-star Bizarro who owns an amusement park and who fights against his own obsolescence.Action Comics Annual #8 (1996) The Elseworlds one-shot The Superman Monster (1999), essentially a Frankenstein pastiche, features a monstrous copy of Bizarro created by a Viktor Luthor based on the remains of the infant Kal-El, who died upon arrival.The Superman Monster #1 In the limited series JLA: The Nail, having found Kal-El's ship, Lex Luthor uses DNA samples to create Bizarro-like duplicates, which he disguises as the \\"Liberator\\" robots to hunt down the supposedly rogue metahumans.JLA: The Nail #3 While the Liberators possess Superman's powers in terms of strength and speed, their genetic structure proves to be unstable, to the point that they collapse after sustaining even minor damage in combat with metahuman foes, relying on stealth and superior numbers to overwhelm their prisoners. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the prequel comic to the video game, Lex Luthor comes up with the idea of creating a clone of Superman that can combat the corrupt Man of Steel. However, the clone escapes before the process can be completed, resulting in the clone having gray skin and diminished mental capacity. The clone travels to Germany where he meets a man who confuses it with Superman, making the clone assume this is his identity. Giving the clone a Superman suit with the S backwards, the clone goes on to try to establish peacebut because he lacks common sense and a basic understanding of human ways, he inadvertently wreaks havoc and kills Weather Wizard and Heatwave. The Trickster is able to take advantage of the clone's mental limitation to convince him they are friends and the \\"imposter\\" Superman is his enemy. The clone becomes known to the Regime, with Superman meeting him as Solomon Grundy is being captured. Yellow Lantern gives him the name 'Bizarro' since he proves to be an imperfect clone of Superman. Bizarro gets away before they can discover his origin. Trickster has difficulty keeping the clone in check, as the clone ends up killing an entire restaurant of civilians when he misunderstands Trickster's instructions. Trickster resolves to be more specific, but Bizarro accidentally drops him during flight, leading to Trickster's death. Not comprehending death, Bizarro takes Trickster's corpse to the German man who helped him. The man calls the Regime for aid, so Bizarro returns to the first place he remembersLuthor's laboratory. Luthor realizes that the clone will inadvertently expose his work, so he sends Bizarro to the Fortress of Solitude, nominally for answers but in reality to be ambushed by the Luthor-controlled Doomsday. This leads to a fierce fight between the two, which is interrupted when the actual Superman arrives. The three-way battle tears across the Arctic with Luthor trying to prolong it by repeatedly switching Doomsday's assigned target, but he eventually realizes that he can't bring himself to murder even the corrupted Clark, and that Bizarro can't live to reveal Luthor's double agency. When Superman is briefly incapacitated, Luthor turns Doomsday on the unsuspecting clone and succeeds in killing him before having the monster stand down. Superman, furious, takes Bizarro's corpse to Luthor to run tests, not realizing his ally's complicity. In other media =Television= Live action * In the 1st-season episode \\"Vatman\\" of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Lex Luthor creates a clone of Superman, being an adaptation of Bizarro. He is portrayed by Dean Cain who portrayed Superman as well.Lois and Clark The New adventures of Superman * Bizarro appears in 7 episodes of the Superboy TV series which ran from 1988 to 1992, portrayed by Barry Meyers. This Bizarro is most like the original silver-age Bizarro, in that he was not truly villainous, but lashed out at society considering him a dangerous freak (indeed, Superboy often expressed his reluctance to attack his \\"brother\\" as they were of like powers). He was created when an experimental duplicating ray was overcharged during a lightning storm and Superboy was accidentally exposed to it. When Superboy and Professor Peterson (the ray's inventor) gasp at what has been created, Superboy remarks \\"It is bizarre\\", to which the creation responds \\"Me Bizarro\\", so aptly named, then ran away to the outside world. While in a shopping center, Bizarro manages to cause a ruckus by scaring civilians and getting in a fight with sheriff's deputies, and mistakingly believed this was that he was undisguised. He helps himself to civilain clothes and calls himself \\"Kent Clark\\". He was in love with Lana Lang. Overreacting when a man gets fresh with Lana at a party, he violently attacks him, then kidnaps Lana and takes her to a furniture store, claiming he has found a home for them to settle in. Meanwhile, Professor Peterson warns Superboy that a Bizzaro-like flower he made during his first attempt to duplicate a rose has just exploded, and the same will soon happen to Bizarro, only delayed by his much larger mass than the flower. Superboy first attempts to stop Bizarro with kryptonite, but Bizarro's DNA is too dissimilar to be affected. The inventor then duplicates Krptonite, which is used on Bizarro, only to prevent his explosion and granting him a slightly more stable personality. The inventor then realizes being an antithesis that the duplicated kryptonite healed rather than harm. In his second appearance, Lex Luthor tricks Bizarro into attacking Superboy in exchange for a girlfriend. Luthor creates such girlfriend by duplicating Lana Lang, but the \\"Bizarro Lana\\" convinces Bizarro she cannot love one who aids wrongdoers, where Bizarro promptly defects to Superboy in thwarting Luthor. In his final episodes, Bizarro was made human by an experimental process that copied Superboy's brainwaves to his own brain. After extensive plastic surgery, Bizarro was totally human, with no super-powers, and took the name Bill Zarro. But the brainwave transfer left Superboy in a severely weakened state, and he was captured by a terrorist called Chaos, who intended to throw him off the top of a skyscraper to kill him. Bizarro was forced to reverse the process to get his powers back and save Superboy. Tom Welling seen in the 2007 Smallville episode \\"Bizarro\\". * Bizarro appears in Smallville (2001‚Äì2011) played by Tom Welling. Introduced in the episode \\"Phantom\\", this version is presented as a Phantom of the result of a Kryptonian experiment that was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone until accidentally released by Clark Kent (alongside other inmates coined \\"Zoners\\"). The Phantom quickly discovered that it couldn't survive for long outside of the Phantom Zone, but it managed to survive by possessing humans. Unfortunately, a human host could only contain it for about 24 hours, before the host was destroyed and he had to find a new host. This went on for many months, until the Phantom encountered Clark Kent, a Kryptonian. The only kind of body that could contain the Phantom entity steals a portion of Clark's Kryptonian DNA and becomes an evil version of him, possessing all of his strengths but with an inverted version of his ability to absorb energy, its skin taking on a fragmented appearance when exposed to direct sunlight as it absorbs power from green kryptonite. The entity is defeated in the episode \\"Bizarro\\", when Clark is able to trap it on the sunny side of Mars with help from the Martian Manhunter. It returns in \\"Gemini\\" (attributed by the producers to the solar eclipse caused in \\"Blue\\" blocking off sunlight long enough for the clone to escape), taking an imprisoned Clark's place. After talking with Brainiac to try and find a cure for its weakness to sunlight, it is destroyed by blue kryptonite in the episode \\"Persona\\", the blue kryptonite overloading Bizarro just as it renders Clark powerless. * The Supergirl version of Bizarro (Bizarro-Girl) appears in Supergirl, portrayed by Hope Lauren and Melissa Benoist. An unidentified woman, known only as \\"Jane Doe\\" and dubbed \\"Bizarro\\" by Cat Grant, is a brain trauma patient that was transformed by Lord Technologies into a clone, of sorts, of Supergirl. She first appears in the episode \\"Blood Bonds\\" as the pet project of Maxwell Lord, and later shows up in a costume similar to Supergirl's near the end of the episode \\"Strange Visitor From Another Planet.\\" She picks up a vehicle from a bridge and tosses it, while the real Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) and her foster sister Alex Danvers watch on their TV set. Her story and origin are featured in the 12th episode, titled \\"Bizarro\\". Bizarro attacks Kara on her date with Adam Foster. Her skin cracks and turns gray-white when hit by kryptonite by Alex Danvers. She later kidnaps James Olsen, but is finally stopped by Supergirl and Alex with blue kryptonite bullets. Supergirl takes the incapacitated Bizarro back to the DEO where she is returned to a coma state until they can find a way to help her. This version isn't a clone, but instead was created by genetically altering a permanently comatose human female that closely resembles Supergirl and infusing her with Supergirl's DNA, which was picked up from the Red Tornado's broken arm. A total of seven girls were used by Lord for the experiment, the rest presumably discarded as failures. ** Bizarro is also alluded to in the 2018 Arrowverse crossover event Elseworlds, where in John Deegan's altered reality, a civilian refers to Superman as Bizarro during his battle with Deegan.

His history of being unsuccessfully cloned from Superman by someone has been mentioned while presented as a well-meaning but absent minded person. Wanting to join the Justice League, Bizarro is shown having taken Wonder Woman on a \\"date\\" to a miniature golf course where his striking at the golf ball caused damages to the miniature golf course. When Amazo attacked the Justice League Watchtower, Bizarro followed Wonder Woman to the Justice League Watchtower to help. After Wonder Woman gets trapped by Amazo, Bizarro flies off to get the \\"smartest man in the galaxy\\" who turns out to be Space Cabbie. As Space Cabbie struggles to free the captive Justice League members so that they can cancel the message that would lure the other Justice League members into a trap, Bizarro defeats Amazo by overloading him with his backwards lifestyle. Afterwards when Bizarro wanted to join the Justice League, Batman states a condition of joining that would cause Bizarro to do the opposite by leaving the Justice League Watchtower. * A Bizarro counterpart of Supergirl appears in the DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"#TheGoodTheBadAndTheBizarre,\\" voiced by Nicole Sullivan. The Bizarro Supergirl comes to Earth in hopes of proving herself a better villain than her world's version of Superman, destroying Supergirl's reputation in the process while revealed to be responsible for an incident that got Kara expelled from her previous high school. =Film= * According to writer Mark Rosenthal's commentary of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, released on the 2006 DVD, there are approximately forty-five minutes of deleted scenes cut from the film that have not been seen by the general public. Cut scenes featured a different version of Nuclear Man (portrayed by Clive Mantle) engaging Superman in battle outside the Metro Club and being destroyed by the Man of Steel. This version of Nuclear Man resembled in looks, and significantly in personality, to Bizarro. * In 2007, film director Bryan Singer reported that he wanted to use Bizarro, along with Brainiac, as an antagonist in the film Superman: The Man of Steel, the sequel for Superman Returns. * Bizarro appears in JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time (2014), voiced by Michael Donovan. He appears as a member of the Legion of Doom. Bizarro, Toyman, and Cheetah, and Solomon Grundy go back in time to Smallville to send baby Kal-El back into space to prevent him from becoming Superman. They are thwarted by Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash. * Bizarro appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League (2015), voiced again by Nolan North. Rather than his usual role as an antagonist, Bizarro is portrayed as a well-meaning klutz desperate to help Superman look after Metropolis. His origin is explained as Lex Luthor hit Superman with a duplicator ray in order to create a clone he could control. In order to prevent Bizarro from causing any more destruction, Superman takes him to a strange planet which he calls, \\"Bizarro World\\" where Bizarro defends yellow crystals with faces carved into them. When Darkseid starts collecting the yellow crystals, he returns to Earth and steals the Duplicator Ray which he uses to create Bizarro versions of Wonder Woman, Batman, Cyborg, and Guy Gardner called Bizarra, Batzarro, Cyzarro, and Greenzarro. Bizarro later created a Kryptonite bomb to help save Bizarro World. After realizing his intentions, the Justice League and Bizarro League team up and defeat Darkseid and save Bizarro World. * The Red Son version of Bizarro called \\"Superior Man\\" appears in Superman: Red Son, voiced by Travis Willingham. Like his comic origin, he's created as an \\"American Superman\\" but unlike his counterpart, this version is indistinguishable to Superman and can articulate, proclaiming repeatedly \\"I am Truth, I am Justice, I am the American Way\\". During his brawl, his power was amplified directly by Lex Luthor causing mutations and a breakdown of motor functions, resulting in the clone becoming a monster and disintegrating, before the shocked Superman's eyes. Before his death, Superior Man began speaking in power grammar. =Video games= * Bizarro appears in Superman (1999). * Bizarro appears in Superman: The Man of Steel (2002). * Bizarro appears as a playable character in Superman Returns (2006) voiced by John DiMaggio. * Bizarro appears in DC Universe Online (2011) voiced by Joe Mandia. * Bizarro appears as a bonus character in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes (2012) voiced by Travis Willingham. * Bizarro appears as a support card in Injustice: Gods Among Us (2013). * Bizarro appears via DLC as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Nolan North.

He appears as a playable character, via a premier skin for Superman. While Bizarro basically has the same moveset as Superman, certain abilities are alternated such as Heat Vision being replaced with Cold Vision and Heat Breath replaces Superman's freezing super breath. Additionally in pre-battle intro animation the handcuffs he wears have a piece of Blue Kryptonite instead of the Green Kryptonite that appears in Superman's version of said intro, though Bizarro is able to break the handcuffs just as Superman does. * Bizarro appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced by Nolan North. =Miscellaneous= * Warner Bros. Consumer Products collaborated with Livobooks to produce the first Superman interactive motion comic Mobile app \\"Superman and Bizarro Save the Planet\\" on iOS and Android. * Bizarro is the name of a steel roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure. * \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", the 137th episode of the American television sitcom Seinfeld, extensively references Bizarro. Jerry calls Elaine's friend Kevin and his acquaintances the \\"Bizarro\\" counterparts of himself, Kramer, and George. Kevin's apartment contains a statue of Bizarro, and Kevin speaks the final lines of the episode in Bizarro's characteristic grammar (i.e. with \\"Me\\" as the subject). * In Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: A Game of You, the existence of an in-universe comic book featuring \\"Weirdzos\\" is an analogy to Bizarros. \\"Weirdzo #1\\" speaks and looks like Bizarro and makes reference to events in Bizarro comics. While The Sandman series was published by DC Comics's Vertigo imprint, editors were reluctant to allow Superman-related characters to be featured in the more adult-themed Vertigo line.

It was run out of the basement of the oldest recreation center of the City of Detroit, and became a household word in the sport of boxing and its gold shorts a magnet to young talent following the enormous success and high profile of multiple World Champion and Boxing Hall of Famer Thomas \\"The Hitman\\" Hearns in the 1980s. The training facility opened shortly after World War I (~1920) and closed in 2006. It reopened in 2015.  History  =Original Detroit gym= Kronk began to earn fame during the late 1970s, when prospects like Hilmer Kenty, Thomas Hearns and Mickey Goodwin trained there. In 1980, Kenty became Kronk's first world champion, Hearns following him months after. In 1983, Kronk fighter Milton McCrory won the WBC welterweight title vacated by Sugar Ray Leonard; Jimmy Paul beat Harry Arroyo for the International Boxing Federation's world lightweight title in 1985. Duane Thomas, another Kronk fighter, beat John Mugabi for the WBC light middleweight title in 1986. McCrory's brother, Steve McCrory, was also a world champion who as an amateur won the flyweight gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1984 four Kronk team members of various weight classes were ranked world's top ten by AIBA: Steve McCrory #1 at 112 lbs, Mark Breland #1 at 147 lbs, Frank Tate #5 at 156 lbs, and Ricky Womack #3 at 178 lbs.AIBA rankings 1984, CLIPPED FROM Detroit Free Press, 14 Feb 1984, Tue, page 42 In the 1990s the Kronk stable included two-time WBA welterweight champion Mark Breland, top amateur prospect and future contender Tarick Salmaci, and repeat welterweight contender Oba Carr. Among the many world champions who trained at Kronk at least once during their careers are Michael Moorer, Wilfred Ben√≠tez (in the Tucson gym), H√©ctor Camacho, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez, Naseem Hamed, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Jermain Taylor and Tyson Fury. =Tucson gym= Kronk opened a second gym in Tucson, Arizona during the 1990s. A new host of fighters who would later become world champions arrived there, including Gerald McClellan. The Kronk \\"franchise\\" began to sell Kronk merchandise through catalog sales. In 1998 Kronk opened Kronk Gym website, promoting the gyms and their fighters. =Detroit gym closure= In September 2006, the original gym at 5555 McGraw Avenue between 33rd and Junction Streets in Detroit closed temporarily after thieves stole copper water pipes, cutting off supply to the building. Boxers relocated to a Dearborn Gold's Gym. A \\"Save the Kronk\\" campaign aimed at keeping the facilities from closing due to budget shortfall was spearheaded by Emanuel Steward. The campaign would ultimately work toward building a new Kronk. The gym and recreation center was officially closed by the Recreation Department on November 28, 2006 due to the prohibitive cost of repairs to the plumbing and building infrastructure. In the past few years, the Detroit gym relocated to a new facility in a storefront on West Warren Avenue. On October 7, 2017, the original Kronk Gym went up in flames in a suspicious fire. The roof was destroyed and the basement gym was heavily damaged. = Reopening = Logo on wall in locker room of new gym locationThe new facility opened on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 at 9520 Mettetal St. On August 20, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions on sports events, the gym hosted its first ever professional boxing event, a long-time dream held by Steward. The card was headlined by Kronk fighter Vladimir Shishkin who defeated Oscar Riojas via ninth-round technical knockout.

It was formulated by the Scottish mathematician William Vallance Douglas Hodge as a result of a work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de Rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties. It received little attention before Hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Hodge conjecture is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, with a prize of $1,000,000 for whoever can prove or disprove the Hodge conjecture.  Motivation  Let X be a compact complex manifold of complex dimension n. Then X is an orientable smooth manifold of real dimension 2n, so its cohomology groups lie in degrees zero through 2n. Assume X is a K√§hler manifold, so that there is a decomposition on its cohomology with complex coefficients :H^k(X, \\\\C) = \\\\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X), where H^{p,q}(X) is the subgroup of cohomology classes which are represented by harmonic forms of type (p,q). That is, these are the cohomology classes represented by differential forms which, in some choice of local coordinates z_1, \\\\ldots, z_n, can be written as a harmonic function times :dz_{i_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dz_{i_p} \\\\wedge d\\\\bar z_{j_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge d\\\\bar z_{j_q}. (See Hodge theory for more details.) Taking wedge products of these harmonic representatives corresponds to the cup product in cohomology, so the cup product is compatible with the Hodge decomposition: :\\\\cup \\\\colon H^{p,q}(X) \\\\times H^{p',q'}(X) \\\\rightarrow H^{p+p',q+q'}(X). Since X is a compact oriented manifold, X has a fundamental class. Let Z be a complex submanifold of X of dimension k, and let i\\\\colon Z\\\\to X be the inclusion map. Choose a differential form \\\\alpha of type (p,q). We can integrate \\\\alpha over Z: :\\\\int_Z i^*\\\\alpha. To evaluate this integral, choose a point of Z and call it 0. Around 0, we can choose local coordinates z_1, \\\\ldots, z_k on X such that Z is just z_{k+1} = \\\\cdots = z_n = 0. If p>k, then \\\\alpha must contain some dz_i where z_i pulls back to zero on Z. The same is true if q > k. Consequently, this integral is zero if (p,q) e (k,k). More abstractly, the integral can be written as the cap product of the homology class of Z and the cohomology class represented by \\\\alpha. By Poincar√© duality, the homology class of Z is dual to a cohomology class which we will call [Z], and the cap product can be computed by taking the cup product of [Z] and Œ± and capping with the fundamental class of X. Because [Z] is a cohomology class, it has a Hodge decomposition. By the computation we did above, if we cup this class with any class of type (p,q) e (k,k), then we get zero. Because H^{2n}(X, \\\\C) = H^{n,n}(X), we conclude that [Z] must lie in H^{n-k,n-k}(X). Loosely speaking, the Hodge conjecture asks: :Which cohomology classes in H^{k,k}(X) come from complex subvarieties Z?  Statement of the Hodge conjecture  Let: :\\\\operatorname{Hdg}^k(X) = H^{2k}(X, \\\\Q) \\\\cap H^{k,k}(X). We call this the group of Hodge classes of degree 2k on X. The modern statement of the Hodge conjecture is: ::Hodge conjecture. Let X be a non-singular complex projective manifold. Then every Hodge class on X is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of X. A projective complex manifold is a complex manifold which can be embedded in complex projective space. Because projective space carries a K√§hler metric, the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric, such a manifold is always a K√§hler manifold. By Chow's theorem, a projective complex manifold is also a smooth projective algebraic variety, that is, it is the zero set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials. = Reformulation in terms of algebraic cycles = Another way of phrasing the Hodge conjecture involves the idea of an algebraic cycle. An algebraic cycle on X is a formal combination of subvarieties of X; that is, it is something of the form: : \\\\sum_i c_iZ_i. The coefficients are usually taken to be integral or rational. We define the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle to be the sum of the cohomology classes of its components. This is an example of the cycle class map of de Rham cohomology, see Weil cohomology. For example, the cohomology class of the above cycle would be: :\\\\sum_i c_i[Z_i]. Such a cohomology class is called algebraic. With this notation, the Hodge conjecture becomes: ::Let X be a projective complex manifold. Then every Hodge class on X is algebraic. The assumption in the Hodge conjecture that X be algebraic (projective complex manifold) cannot be weakened. In 1977, Steven Zucker showed that it is possible to construct a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture as complex tori with analytic rational cohomology of type (p,p), which is not projective algebraic. (see appendix B of )  Known cases of the Hodge conjecture  = Low dimension and codimension = The first result on the Hodge conjecture is due to . In fact, it predates the conjecture and provided some of Hodge's motivation. ::Theorem (Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes) Any element of H^2(X,\\\\Z)\\\\cap H^{1,1}(X) is the cohomology class of a divisor on X. In particular, the Hodge conjecture is true for H^2. A very quick proof can be given using sheaf cohomology and the exponential exact sequence. (The cohomology class of a divisor turns out to equal to its first Chern class.) Lefschetz's original proof proceeded by normal functions, which were introduced by Henri Poincar√©. However, the Griffiths transversality theorem shows that this approach cannot prove the Hodge conjecture for higher codimensional subvarieties. By the Hard Lefschetz theorem, one can prove: ::Theorem. If the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree p, for all p < n, then the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree 2n-p. Combining the above two theorems implies that Hodge conjecture is true for Hodge classes of degree 2n-p. This proves the Hodge conjecture when X has dimension at most three. The Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes also implies that if all Hodge classes are generated by the Hodge classes of divisors, then the Hodge conjecture is true: ::Corollary. If the algebra \\\\operatorname{Hdg}^*(X) = \\\\bigoplus olimits_k \\\\operatorname{Hdg}^k(X) is generated by \\\\operatorname{Hdg}^1(X), then the Hodge conjecture holds for X. = Hypersurfaces = By the strong and weak Lefschetz theorem, the only non- trivial part of the Hodge conjecture for hypersurfaces is the degree m part (i.e., the middle cohomology) of a 2m-dimensional hypersurface X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf P^{2m+1}. If the degree d is 2, i.e., X is a quadric, the Hodge conjecture holds for all m. For m = 2, i.e., fourfolds, the Hodge conjecture is known for d \\\\le 5.James Lewis: A Survey of the Hodge Conjecture, 1991, Example 7.21 = Abelian varieties = For most abelian varieties, the algebra Hdg*(X) is generated in degree one, so the Hodge conjecture holds. In particular, the Hodge conjecture holds for sufficiently general abelian varieties, for products of elliptic curves, and for simple abelian varieties of prime dimension. However, constructed an example of an abelian variety where Hdg2(X) is not generated by products of divisor classes. generalized this example by showing that whenever the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field, then Hdg2(X) is not generated by products of divisor classes. proved that in dimension less than 5, either Hdg*(X) is generated in degree one, or the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field. In the latter case, the Hodge conjecture is only known in special cases.  Generalizations  = The integral Hodge conjecture = Hodge's original conjecture was: ::Integral Hodge conjecture. Let be a projective complex manifold. Then every cohomology class in H^{2k}(X, \\\\Z) \\\\cap H^{k,k}(X) is the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on This is now known to be false. The first counterexample was constructed by . Using K-theory, they constructed an example of a torsion cohomology class‚Äîthat is, a cohomology class such that for some positive integer ‚Äîwhich is not the class of an algebraic cycle. Such a class is necessarily a Hodge class. reinterpreted their result in the framework of cobordism and found many examples of such classes. The simplest adjustment of the integral Hodge conjecture is: ::Integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion. Let be a projective complex manifold. Then every cohomology class in H^{2k}(X, \\\\Z) \\\\cap H^{k,k}(X) is the sum of a torsion class and the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on Equivalently, after dividing H^{2k}(X, \\\\Z) \\\\cap H^{k,k}(X) by torsion classes, every class is the image of the cohomology class of an integral algebraic cycle. This is also false. found an example of a Hodge class which is not algebraic, but which has an integral multiple which is algebraic. have shown that in order to obtain a correct integral Hodge conjecture, one needs to replace Chow groups, which can also be expressed as motivic cohomology groups, by a variant known as √©tale (or Lichtenbaum) motivic cohomology. They show that the rational Hodge conjecture is equivalent to an integral Hodge conjecture for this modified motivic cohomology. = The Hodge conjecture for K√§hler varieties = A natural generalization of the Hodge conjecture would ask: ::Hodge conjecture for K√§hler varieties, naive version. Let X be a complex K√§hler manifold. Then every Hodge class on X is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of X. This is too optimistic, because there are not enough subvarieties to make this work. A possible substitute is to ask instead one of the two following questions: ::Hodge conjecture for K√§hler varieties, vector bundle version. Let X be a complex K√§hler manifold. Then every Hodge class on X is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of vector bundles on X. ::Hodge conjecture for K√§hler varieties, coherent sheaf version. Let X be a complex K√§hler manifold. Then every Hodge class on X is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of coherent sheaves on X. proved that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves give strictly more Hodge classes than the Chern classes of vector bundles and that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves are insufficient to generate all the Hodge classes. Consequently, the only known formulations of the Hodge conjecture for K√§hler varieties are false. = The generalized Hodge conjecture = Hodge made an additional, stronger conjecture than the integral Hodge conjecture. Say that a cohomology class on X is of co-level c (coniveau c) if it is the pushforward of a cohomology class on a c-codimensional subvariety of X. The cohomology classes of co-level at least c filter the cohomology of X, and it is easy to see that the cth step of the filtration N'H(X, Z) satisfies :N^cH^k(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\subseteq H^k(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\cap (H^{k-c,c}(X) \\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X)). Hodge's original statement was: ::Generalized Hodge conjecture, Hodge's version. N^cH^k(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) = H^k(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\cap (H^{k-c,c}(X) \\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X)). observed that this cannot be true, even with rational coefficients, because the right-hand side is not always a Hodge structure. His corrected form of the Hodge conjecture is: ::Generalized Hodge conjecture. N'H(X, Q) is the largest sub-Hodge structure of H(X, Z) contained in H^{k-c,c}(X) \\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X). This version is open.  Algebraicity of Hodge loci  The strongest evidence in favor of the Hodge conjecture is the algebraicity result of . Suppose that we vary the complex structure of X over a simply connected base. Then the topological cohomology of X does not change, but the Hodge decomposition does change. It is known that if the Hodge conjecture is true, then the locus of all points on the base where the cohomology of a fiber is a Hodge class is in fact an algebraic subset, that is, it is cut out by polynomial equations. Cattani, Deligne & Kaplan (1995) proved that this is always true, without assuming the Hodge conjecture.

Two trials in 1964 on that charge, with all-white juries, resulted in hung juries. In 1994, he was tried by the state in a new trial based on new evidence and was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. Early life and career De La Beckwith was born in Colusa, California, the son of Susan Southworth Yerger and Byron De La Beckwith Sr., who was the town's postmaster. His father died of pneumonia when he was 5. One year later, De La Beckwith and his mother settled in Greenwood, Mississippi, to be near family. His mother died of lung cancer when he was 12 years old, leaving him orphaned. He was raised by his maternal uncle William Greene Yerger and his wife. He was related by marriage to the socialist author Upton Sinclair, and attended the prestigious southern prep school in Bell Buckle, Tennessee called The Webb School. In January 1942, De La Beckwith enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving as a machine gunner in the Pacific theater of World War II. He fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal and was shot in the waist during the Battle of Tarawa. He was honorably discharged in August 1945. After serving in the Marine Corps, De La Beckwith moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he married Mary Louise Williams. The couple relocated to Mississippi, where they settled in his hometown of Greenwood. They had a son together, Delay De La Beckwith. De La Beckwith and Williams divorced. He later married Thelma Lindsay Neff. De La Beckwith worked as a salesman for most of his life, selling tobacco, fertilizer, wood stoves, and other goods. In 1954, following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, he became a member of a newly formed organization, White Citizens' Council. The group was formed in Mississippi that year in order to resist integration and maintain the exclusion of blacks from the state's political system. White Citizens' Council The White Citizens' Council was founded in 1954 following the United States Supreme Court's ruling that de jure public school segregation was unconstitutional. Begun in Mississippi, chapters arose in towns across the South among whites who wanted to resist integration. Their members used a variety of economic tactics to suppress black activism and sustain segregation. The councils applied severe pressure by boycotting black businesses, denying loans and credit to African Americans, firing people from their jobs, and other means. In Mississippi they prevented school integration until 1964.Dr. John Dittmer, \\"'Barbour is an Unreconstructed Southerner': Prof. John Dittmer on Mississippi Governor‚Äôs Praise of White Citizens‚Äô Councils\\", 22 December 2010 video report by Democracy Now!. Retrieved November 21, 2011 Medgar Evers' first work for the NAACP on a national level involved interviewing Mississippians who had been intimidated by the White Citizens' Councils and preparing affidavits for use as evidence against the councils if necessary. De La Beckwith was a member of the White Citizens' Council and the Ku Klux Klan. Assassination of Medgar Evers On June 12, 1963, at age 42, De La Beckwith assassinated NAACP and civil rights leader Medgar Evers shortly after the activist arrived home in Jackson. Beckwith was positioned across the street with a rifle, and he shot Evers in the back. Evers died an hour later, aged 37. Myrlie Evers, his wife, and his three children, James, Reena, and Darrell Evers, were home at the time of the assassination. Their son Darrell recalled the night: \\"We were ready to greet him, because every time he came home it was special for us. He was traveling a lot at that time. All of a sudden, we heard a shot. We knew what it was.\\"Hansen, Mark. ABA Journal, March 1993, Vol.79, p.26(1); Justice, Glen. \\"'The Word Is Free': For the Three Children of Civil Rights Martyr Medgar Evers, the Conviction of Their Father's Murderer after 30 Years Has Finally Ended a Lifetime in Limbo.

Darrell and the other children fled to the bathroom to hide in the bathtub. All three children had been taught by their parents and forced to practice drills for safety prior to their father's death because of threats made against him and two previous attacks on the house.  Trials  The state twice prosecuted De La Beckwith for murder in 1964, but both trials ended with hung juries. Mississippi had effectively disenfranchised black voters since 1890, so they were effectively excluded from serving on juries, whose members were drawn from voter rolls. During the second trial, Ross Barnett, governor of Mississippi at the time of the assassination, interrupted the proceedings to shake hands with De La Beckwith while Medgar Evers' widow was testifying. The White Citizens' Council paid De La Beckwith's legal expenses in both his 1964 trials. In January 1966, De La Beckwith, along with a number of other members of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify about Klan activities. Although De La Beckwith gave his name when asked by the committee (other witnesses, such as Samuel Bowers, invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to that question), he answered no other substantive questions. In the following years, De La Beckwith became a leader in the segregationist Phineas Priesthood, an offshoot of the white supremacist Christian Identity movement. The group was known for its hostility toward African Americans, Jews, Catholics, and foreigners. According to Delmar Dennis, who acted as a key witness for the prosecution at the 1994 trial, De La Beckwith boasted of his role in the death of Medgar Evers at several Ku Klux Klan rallies and similar gatherings in the years following his mistrials. In 1967, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi. In 1969, De La Beckwith's previous charges were dismissed. In 1973, informants alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he planned to murder A.I. Botnick, director of the New Orleans-based B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League. The attack was a racially motivated retaliation for comments that Botnick had made about white Southerners and race relations. Following several days of surveillance, New Orleans Police Department officers stopped De La Beckwith as he was traveling by car on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway Bridge to New Orleans. Among the contents of his vehicle were several loaded firearms, a map with highlighted directions to Botnick's house, and a dynamite time bomb. On August 1, 1975, De La Beckwith was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder; he served nearly three years at the Angola Prison in Louisiana from May 1977 until he was paroled in January 1980. Just before entering prison to serve his sentence, De La Beckwith was ordained by Reverend Dewey \\"Buddy\\" Tucker as a minister in the Temple Memorial Baptist Church, a Christian Identity congregation in Knoxville, Tennessee.Lloyd, James B. (11-1-1995). \\"TENNESSEE, RACISM, AND THE NEW RIGHT: THE SECOND BECKWITH COLLECTION,\\" The Library Development Review 1994-95: 3. In the 1980s, the Jackson Clarion-Ledger published reports on its investigation of De La Beckwith's trials in the 1960s. It found that the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state agency supported by residents' taxes and purportedly protecting the image of the state, had assisted De La Beckwith's attorneys in his second trial. The commission had worked against the civil rights movement in numerous ways. In this case, it used state resources to investigate members of the jury pool during voir dire to aid the defense in picking a sympathetic jury. These findings of illegality contributed to a retrial of De La Beckwith by the state in 1994. 1994 trial for Evers murder Myrlie Evers, who later became the third woman to chair the NAACP, refused to abandon her husband's case. When new documents showed that jurors in the previous case were investigated illegally and screened by a state agency, she pressed authorities to re-open the case. In the 1980s, the reporting by the Jackson Clarion-Ledger about the earlier Beckwith trials resulted in the state mounting a new investigation. It ultimately initiated a third prosecution, based on this and other new evidence. By this time, De La Beckwith was living in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. He was extradited to Mississippi for trial at the Hinds County Courthouse in Jackson. Before his trial, the 71-year-old white supremacist had asked the justices to dismiss the case against him on the grounds that it violated his rights to a speedy trial, due process and protection from double jeopardy.\\"Third trial allowed; white supremacist loses appeal: Byron De La Beckwith\\". Hansen, Mark. ABA Journal, March 1993, Vol.79, p.26(1) The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled against his motion by a 4-3 vote, and the case was scheduled to be heard in January 1994. During this third trial, the murder weapon was presented, an Enfield .30-06 caliber rifle, with Beckwith's fingerprints. Beckwith claimed that the gun was stolen from his house. He listed his health problems, high blood pressure, lack of energy and kidney problems, saying \\"I need a list to recite everything I suffer from, and I hate to complain because I'm not the complaining type\\".\\"Sentenced, Byron De La Beckwith\\", Time, 14 Feb 1994, Vol.143(7), p.18(1) The 1994 state trial was held before a jury consisting of eight black people and four white people. They convicted De La Beckwith of first-degree murder for killing Medgar Evers. New evidence included testimony that he had boasted of the murder at a Klan rally, and that he had boasted of the murder to others during the three decades since the crime had occurred. The physical evidence was essentially the same as that presented during the first two trials. De La Beckwith appealed against the guilty verdict, but the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the conviction in 1997. The court said that the 31-year lapse between the murder and De La Beckwith's conviction did not deny him a fair trial. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder without the possibility of parole. De La Beckwith sought judicial review in the United States Supreme Court, but his petition for certiorari was denied.De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 880 (1998). On January 21, 2001, De La Beckwith died after he was transferred from prison to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. He was 80 years old. He had suffered from heart disease, high blood pressure, and other ailments for some time. Representation in other media * Where Is the Voice Coming From?

Its capital is the municipality also named Siquijor. To the north of Siquijor is Cebu, to the west is Negros, northeast is Bohol, and to the south, across the Bohol Sea, is Mindanao. During the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, the Spaniards called the island Isla del Fuego (Island of Fire). Siquijor is commonly associated with mystic traditions that the island's growing tourism industry capitalizes on. History =Creation of the Island= A Siquijor legend tells of a great storm which once engulfed the region. Then there came a strong earthquake that shook the earth and sea. Amidst the lightning and thunder arose an island from the depths of the ocean's womb which came to be known as the island. Despite being a legend, modern times highland farmers have unraveled giant shell casings under farm plots, supporting the theory that Siquijor is indeed an island that rose from the sea.https://dumagueteinfo.com/other-destinations/siquijor-island/siquijor- history/http://www.luzpalma.com/Information%20gather%20from%20the%20island%20of%20Siquijor.html =Precolonial Era= Prior to colonization, the island polity was home to the Kingdom (Kedatuan) of Katugasan, from tugas, the molave trees that cover the hills, which abounded the island along with fireflies. The \\"tugas\\" or molave trees were used by the ancient dwellers of the island in making posts or \\"haligi\\" of their houses because of its strength and durability that could withstand and struggle against strong typhoons and \\"habagat\\" and was proven by the house of \\"Totang\\" built near the artesian well of Cang-igdot. Most of the patriarchs of the island made the \\"tugas\\" trees to a wooden plow or \\"tukod\\" to cultivate the rocky soil for farming using mainly \\"toro\\" or male cattle to pull it through the sticky and hard rocky soil. However, before the discovery of making \\"tugas\\" as the foundations of their house, the primitive Siquijodnons dwelt in the caves as evidenced by the pottery and old tools like stone grinder or \\"liligsan\\" excavated by Mitring from the 3 caves of Sam-ang. During this time, the people of the kingdom was already in contact with Chinese traders, as seen through archaeological evidence including Chinese ceramics and other objects. The art of traditional healing and traditional witchcraft belief systems also developed within this period.https://www.dumagueteinfo.com/other-destinations/siquijor- island/siquijor-history/ During the arrival of the Spanish, the monarch of the island was Datu Kihod, as recorded in Legazpi's chronicles.https://dumagueteinfo.com/other-destinations/siquijor- island/siquijor-history/ =Spanish era= The island was first sighted by the Spaniards in 1565 during Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi's expedition. The Spaniards called the island Isla del Fuego (\\"Island of Fire\\"), because the island gave off an eerie glow, from the great swarms of fireflies that lived in the numerous molave trees on the island. Esteban Rodr√≠guez of the Legazpi expedition led the first Spaniards to discover the island. He was captain of a small party that left Legazpi's camp in Bohol to explore the nearby islands which are now called Pamilican, Siquijor, and Negros The island, along with the rest of the archipelago, was subsequently annexed to the Spanish Empire. Founded in 1783 under the administration of secular clergymen, Siquijor became the first municipality as well as the first parish to be established on the island. Siquijor was, from the beginning, administered by the Diocese of Cebu. As for civil administration, Siquijor was under Bohol since the province had its own governor. The first Augustinian Recollect priest arrived in Siquijor in 1794. Several years later, a priest of the same order founded the parishes of Larena (initially called Canoan), Lazi (formerly Tigbawan), San Juan (Makalipay), and Maria (Cangmeniao). With the exception of Enrique Villanueva, the other five municipalities were established as parishes in 1877. From 1854 to 1892, Siquijor was part of the province of Negros Oriental, and became a sub-province in 1901. =American rule and World War II= At the turn of the century, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States of America with the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Siquijor island felt the presence of American rule when a unit of the American Cavalry Division came and stayed for sometime. The American Military Governor in Manila appointed James Fugate, a scout with the California Volunteers of the U.S. Infantry, to oversee and to implement the organization and development programs in Siquijor Island. Governor Fugate stayed for 16 years as lieutenant governor of Siquijor. While it was not at the center of military action, Siquijor was not spared by World War II. Imperial Japanese detachments occupied the island between 1942 and 1943, announcing their arrival on the island with heavy shelling. At the outbreak of the war, Siquijor was a sub-province of Negros Oriental, headed by Lieutenant Governor Nicolas Parami. Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Japanese forces, Lt. Governor Parami was taken by Japanese soldiers from his residence at Poo, Lazi one evening and brought to the military headquarters in Larena. He was never heard from again. On 10 November 1942, Japanese warships started shelling Lazi from Cangabas Point. In Lazi, a garrison was established in the old Home Economics Building of the Central School. Filipino guerrillas engaged in sabotage and the interaction during this time caused havoc on the Japanese lives and properties. During this period, Siquijor was briefly governed by Shunzo Suzuki, a Japanese civilian appointed by the Japanese forces until he was assassinated in October 1942 by the guerrilla forces led by Iluminado Jumawanin, of Caipilan, Siquijor. Mamor Fukuda took control of Siquijor from June 1943 until the Japanese forces abandoned the island when the liberation forces came in 1944. In 1943, the Japanese puppet government appointed Sebastian Monera of San Juan as Governor of Siquijor. His administration however was cut short when he was executed, presumably by Filipino guerrillas operating in the mountains of Siquijor. On 30 September 1943, the United States submarine USS Bowfin (SS-287) delivered supplies to the people of Siquijor and evacuated people from the island.Helgason, Gu√∞mundur \\"Bowfin (SS-287)\\" Allied Warships uboat.net On 21 February 1945, the destroyer USS Renshaw (DD-499), part of Task Unit 78.7.6, was escorting a convoy of about 50 various landing ships with 12 other escorts. At 10:59, Renshaw was attacked by a Japanese midget submarine off the coast of Siquijor, which caused extensive damage to the ship and killed 19 of the crew. In mid-1945, local Filipino soldiers and officers under the 7th, 75th and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army arrived, and alongside recognized guerrilla fighter groups, liberated Siquijor. =After 1945= St. Isidore the Laborer Church For a time Siquijor was a subprovince of Negros Oriental, but it became an independent province on 17 September 1971, by virtue of Republic Act 6398. The move was supported by the people of Siquijor as they have a distinct culture from those of Negros Oriental, while Marcos used the movement as a means to secure support from the people of the island to pave martial law acceptance the following year. The capital, formerly Larena, was transferred to the municipality of Siquijor in 1972 by Proclamation No. 1075, under martial law. In 2006, the Lazi Church was added by the government as an extension to the Baroque Churches of the Philippines UNESCO World Heritage Site. The inscription of the church has been pending since.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/3860/ Geography Siquijor is an island province in Central Visayas. It lies southeast from Cebu and Negros across Cebu Strait (also called Bohol Strait) and southwest from Bohol. Panglao Island, which is part of Bohol province, has a similar composition of the soil which is found throughout the whole island of Siquijor. With a land area of and a coastline long, Siquijor is the third smallest province of the Philippines, both in terms of population as well as land area: (after Camiguin and Batanes). =Topography= The island lies about east of the nearest point on southern Negros, southeast of Cebu, southwest of Bohol, and north of Zamboanga del Norte in Mindanao. It is predominantly hilly and in many places the hills reach the sea, producing precipitous cliffs. At the center, Mount Malabahoc (locally known as Mount Bandilaan) reaches about in elevation, the highest point on the island. Three marine terraces can be roughly traced especially in the vicinity of Tagibo on the southwestern part of the island, a barrio of San Juan municipality from the seacoast up into the central part. Siquijor is a coralline island, and fossils of the giant clam tridacna are often encountered in the plowed inland fields. On the hilltops there are numerous shells of the molluscan species presently living in the seas around the island. Siquijor was probably formed quite recently, geologically speaking. The ocean depths between Siquijor and Bohol and Mindanao are in the neighborhood of . =Climate= Siquijor has two different climates, dominated by Am. All climate is within Coronas climate type IV, characterised by not very pronounced maximum rainfall with a short dry season from one to three months and a wet season of nine to ten months. The dry season starts in February and lasts through April sometimes extending to midMay. Five of the municipalities have significant rainfall most months of the year, with a short dry season that has little effect. This location is classified as Am (tropical monsoon climate) by K√∂ppen‚ÄìGeiger climate classification system. The average annual temperature in Siquijor is , with variation throughout the year less than 2 degrees Celsius ( deg F). The precipitation about varies between the driest month and the wettest month, with the average rainfall or less. The municipality Lazi has a significant amount of rainfall during the year. This is true even for the driest month. According to K√∂ppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Af (tropical rainforest climate). In a year, the average rainfall is . =Administrative division= Siquijor (province) comprises 6 municipalities. Siquijor (municipality) is the capital and most important port. ; 18th Congress of the Philippines The Lone district of Siquijor is the representation of the province in various national legislatures. The current representative is Jake Vincent S. Villa. Demographics According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 95,984. The average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2015 was , lower than the national growth rate of for the same period. =Languages= The main language spoken in the island province is Cebuano, with Tagalog and English often used as second languages. The former is understood and used as the national lingua franca, but it is rarely used in everyday conversation among locals. =Religion= 95% of the island's residents belong to the Catholic Church, while the remainder belong to various other Christian churches. Despite the province's Catholic affinities, almost all of the residents continue to adhere to traditional practices that were used prior the 15th century, albeit these practices have also adopted Christian belief systems as well. Due to the ingrained and indispensable traditional belief systems, majority of residents have continued to possess a high respect for the natural environment which was revered by the ancestors of the people. Siquijor is known for its unique Philippine culture of blending Catholicism with traditional religious practices - a major part of its people's cultural heritage and identity. =Education= The literacy rate of 92.5% is one of the highest in the country. Tourism Siquijor's long-time reputation as a place of magic and sorcery both attracts and repulses visitors. Siquijor is also well known for its festivals that focus on healing rituals where incantations are sung while the old folks make potions out of herbs, roots, insects and tree barks. Among the many attractions are the beaches, caves, waterfalls, Bandilaan natural park and butterfly sanctuary.Map \\"Tourist Spots: Province of Siquijor\\" GEOPLAN Cebu Foundationgmanews.tv, Butterfly sanctuary inaugurated in Siquijor The most popular of them are the Cambugahay Falls and the old Balete tree, both located in Lazi.http://trotterhop.com/philippines- cebu-siquijor-bohol/ The coral reefs ringing the island offer some of the best diving in the Philippines for snorkelers and scuba divers. Dive courses are conducted by several dive operators on the island in version of PADI, CMAS* and NAUI. Siquijor was declared a marine visitor arrivals among the three provinces in Region VII. Transportation The island of Siquijor has 2 seaports capable of servicing cargo and passenger sea crafts. Siquijor also has an airfield located near Siquijor capable of handling smaller and mostly airplanes.

He was instrumental in numerous revolutionary advances in airline history, including the development and production of the Boeing 314 Clipper, which opened trans-Pacific airline travel, the Boeing Stratoliner which helped to pioneer cabin pressurization, the Boeing 707 and the Boeing 747 which introduced the era of jumbo jets (evolved from Air Force bombers, tanker and transport design, respectively). Trippe's signing of the 747 contract coincided with the 50th anniversary of Boeing, and he gave a speech where he explained his belief that these jets would be a force that would help bring about world peace.Video of Malcolm Stamper, vice-chair of Boeing recounting 1966 speech by Juan Trippe (Great Planes documentary) Early years Trippe was born in Sea Bright, New Jersey, on June 27, 1899, the great-great-grandson of Lieutenant John Trippe, captain of the . Because he was named \\"Juan\\", he is widely assumed to have been of Hispanic descent, but his family was actually Northern European in ancestry and settled in Maryland in 1664. He was named after Juanita Terry, the Venezuelan wife of his great uncle. Trippe attended the Bovea School and graduated from The Hill School in 1917. He enrolled at Yale University but left when the United States entered World War I to apply for flight training with the United States Navy. After completing training in June 1918, he was designated as a Naval Aviator and was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. However, the end of World War I precluded him from flying in combat. Demobilized from active duty, he returned to Yale, graduating in 1921. While there, he was a member of St. Anthony Hall and of the Skull and Bones society. Trippe was treasurer at the first meeting of the National Intercollegiate Flying Association in 1920. Career After graduation from Yale, Trippe began working on Wall Street, but soon became bored. In 1922 he raised money from his old Yale classmates, selling them stock in his new airline, an air-taxi service for the rich and powerful called Long Island Airways. Once again tapping his wealthy friends from Yale, Trippe invested in an airline named Colonial Air Transport, which was awarded a new route and an airmail contract on October 7, 1925. Interested in operating to the Caribbean, Trippe created the Aviation Corporation of the Americas. Based in Florida, the company would evolve into the unofficial United States flag carrier, Pan American Airways, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am's first flight took off on October 19, 1927, from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, in a hired Fairchild FC-2 floatplane being delivered to West Indian Aerial Express in the Dominican Republic. The return flight from Havana to Key West, in a Pan Am Fokker F.VII, took place October 29, being delayed from October 28 by rain. Later, Trippe bought the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to provide domestic air service in the Republic of China, and became a partner in Panagra. In the 1930s. Pan Am became the first airline to cross the Pacific Ocean with the famous Clipper flying boats. Trippe served as the chairman of the board of directors of the airline for all but about two years between the founding of the company and World War II. \\"Sonny\\" Whitney, a stockholder, managed to seize this position. He later regretted his action and allowed Trippe to retake it. For a long time Trippe refused to pardon Whitney. At one point, he even agreed to meet Whitney for lunch for a reconciliation, but changed his mind and turned around shortly after departing from his office in the Chrysler Building. Trippe on the cover of Time magazine, July 1933 Pan Am continued to expand worldwide throughout World War II. Trippe is responsible for several innovations in the airline world. A firm believer in the idea of air travel for all, Trippe is credited as the father of the tourist class in the airline industry, and was the driving force behind Pan Am's formation of the InterContinental hotel group.\\"A Trippe Down Memory Lane\\" Trippe quickly recognized the opportunities presented by jet aircraft and ordered several Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airplanes. Pan Am's first scheduled jet flight was operated on October 26, 1958 by 707 Clipper America from Idlewild International Airport (now JFK) to Le Bourget Airport, Paris. The new jets allowed Pan Am to cut the flight time nearly in half, introduce lower fares, and fly more passengers in total. In 1965, Trippe asked his friend Bill Allen at Boeing to produce an airplane much larger than the 707. The result was the Boeing 747, and Pan Am was the first customer. Originally, Trippe believed the 747 would ultimately be destined to haul cargo only and would be replaced by faster, supersonic aircraft which were then being developed. The supersonic airliners failed to materialize, with the exception of the Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144, and the 747 became the iconic image of international travel. In 1965, Trippe received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. Trippe gave up the presidency of the airline in 1968. He continued to attend meetings of the board of directors and maintained an office in the company's Park Avenue office tower. Personal life Trippe was a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland and president of the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, New York, from 1940 to 1944. Trippe married Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Stettinius Trippe (1904‚Äì1983), the sister of United States Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr., in 1928. They had four children, Elizabeth (\\"Betsy\\"), John Terry, Charles White, and Edward Stettinius Trippe, who now resides in Tucker's Town, Bermuda, where he is executive director of the Tucker's Point Club and serves on Bermuda International Airport's advisory board. The couple remained married until Trippe's death in 1981. Death and legacy Trippe suffered a stroke in September 1980, which forced him to cut back on his workload; he died after suffering a second stroke at his New York City home on April 3, 1981, at the age of 81. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. In 1985, Trippe was posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom by United States President Ronald Reagan. Trippe was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1990.Fortune Magazine 1990 Business Hall of Fame An endowed chair at the Yale University School of Management is the \\"Juan Trippe Professor in the Practice of International Trade, Finance, and Business\\". In 1982, Trippe was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . Trippe is widely regarded as the last of the greatest aviation pioneers along with industry titans such as American Airlines' C. R. Smith, United Airlines' William A. \\"Pat\\" Patterson, Eastern Airlines' Eddie Rickenbacker, and Delta Air Lines' Collett E. Woolman. Under his control, Pan American World Airways became one of the premier international airlines in the world. He is also credited as playing an instrumental role in the development of an intercontinental version of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 as Trippe's determination to get a jet that could cross the Atlantic was instrumental not only in Douglas developing a long-range DC-8, but also Boeing's famed 707 as they had to redesign it in order to stay competitive with Douglas. In popular culture A character based on Trippe was played by Pat O'Brien in Ray Enright's 1936 film The China Clipper. Trippe was played by Alec Baldwin in Martin Scorsese's 2004 film The Aviator.

His artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. Born in Rome to English parents who were both painters, Waterhouse later moved to London, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art. He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions, focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece. Many of his paintings are based on authors such as Homer, Ovid, Shakespeare, Tennyson, or Keats. Waterhouse's work is currently displayed at several major British art galleries, and the Royal Academy of Art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009. Biography =Early life= Waterhouse was born in the city of Rome to the English painters William and Isabella Waterhouse in 1849, in the same year that the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt, were first causing a stir in the London art scene. The exact date of his birth is unknown, though he was baptised on 6 April, and the later scholar of Waterhouse's work, Peter Trippi, believed that he was born between 1 and 23 January. His early life in Italy has been cited as one of the reasons many of his later paintings were set in ancient Rome or based upon scenes taken from Roman mythology. In 1854, the Waterhouses returned to England and moved to a newly built house in South Kensington, London, which was near to the newly founded Victoria and Albert Museum. Waterhouse, or 'Nino' as he was nicknamed, coming from an artistic family, was encouraged to become involved in drawing, and often sketched artworks that he found in the British Museum and the National Gallery. In 1871 he entered the Royal Academy of Art school, initially to study sculpture, before moving on to painting. =Early career= Sleep and his Half-brother Death, 1874 Waterhouse's early works were not Pre-Raphaelite in nature, but were of classical themes in the spirit of Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton. These early works were exhibited at the Dudley Gallery, and the Society of British Artists, and in 1874 his painting Sleep and his Half-brother Death was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition.Trippi, Peter; Prettejohn, Elizabeth; Upstone, Robert. J.M. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite Gallery Guide. The Royal Academy of Art. 2009. The painting was a success and Waterhouse would exhibit at the annual exhibition every year until 1916, with the exception of 1890 and 1915. He then went from strength to strength in the London art scene, his 1876 piece After the Dance being given the prime position in that year's summer exhibition. Perhaps due to his success, his paintings typically became larger and larger in size. =Later career= Good Neighbours (or Gossip), 1885 In 1883, Waterhouse married Esther Kenworthy, the daughter of an art schoolmaster from Ealing who had exhibited her own flower- paintings at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. In 1895 Waterhouse was elected to the status of full Academician. He taught at the St. John's Wood Art School, joined the St John's Wood Arts Club, and served on the Royal Academy Council. One of Waterhouse's best known subjects is The Lady of Shalott, a study of Elaine of Astolat as depicted in the 1832 poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who dies of a mysterious curse after looking directly at the beautiful Lancelot. He actually painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894, and 1916. Another of Waterhouse's favorite subjects was Ophelia; the most familiar of his paintings of Ophelia depicts her just before her death, putting flowers in her hair as she sits on a tree branch leaning over a lake. Like The Lady of Shalott and other Waterhouse paintings, it deals with a woman dying in or near water. He may also have been inspired by paintings of Ophelia by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. He submitted his 1888 Ophelia painting in order to receive his diploma from the Royal Academy. (He had originally wanted to submit a painting titled A Mermaid, but it was not completed in time.) After this, the painting was lost until the 20th century. It is now displayed in the collection of Lord Lloyd- Webber. Waterhouse would paint Ophelia again in 1894 and 1909 or 1910, and he planned another painting in the series, called Ophelia in the Churchyard. Waterhouse could not finish the series of Ophelia paintings because he was gravely ill with cancer by 1915. He died two years later, and his grave can be found at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.J.W.

If A is torsion-free then it embeds into a vector space over the rational numbers of dimension rank A. For finitely generated abelian groups, rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and torsion subgroup. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved. The term rank has a different meaning in the context of elementary abelian groups.  Definition  A subset {aŒ±} of an abelian group is linearly independent (over Z) if the only linear combination of these elements that is equal to zero is trivial: if : \\\\sum_\\\\alpha n_\\\\alpha a_\\\\alpha = 0, \\\\quad n_\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}, where all but finitely many coefficients nŒ± are zero (so that the sum is, in effect, finite), then all summands are 0. Any two maximal linearly independent sets in A have the same cardinality, which is called the rank of A. Rank of an abelian group is analogous to the dimension of a vector space. The main difference with the case of vector space is a presence of torsion. An element of an abelian group A is classified as torsion if its order is finite. The set of all torsion elements is a subgroup, called the torsion subgroup and denoted T(A). A group is called torsion-free if it has no non-trivial torsion elements. The factor- group A/T(A) is the unique maximal torsion-free quotient of A and its rank coincides with the rank of A. The notion of rank with analogous properties can be defined for modules over any integral domain, the case of abelian groups corresponding to modules over Z. For this, see finitely generated module#Generic rank.  Properties  * The rank of an abelian group A coincides with the dimension of the Q-vector space A ‚äó Q. If A is torsion-free then the canonical map A ‚Üí A ‚äó Q is injective and the rank of A is the minimum dimension of Q-vector space containing A as an abelian subgroup. In particular, any intermediate group Zn < A < Qn has rank n. * Abelian groups of rank 0 are exactly the periodic abelian groups. * The group Q of rational numbers has rank 1. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are realized as subgroups of Q and there is a satisfactory classification of them up to isomorphism. By contrast, there is no satisfactory classification of torsion- free abelian groups of rank 2.. On p. 46, Thomas and Schneider refer to \\"...this failure to classify even the rank 2 groups in a satisfactory way...\\" * Rank is additive over short exact sequences: if ::0\\\\to A\\\\to B\\\\to C\\\\to 0\\\\; :is a short exact sequence of abelian groups then rk B = rk A + rk C. This follows from the flatness of Q and the corresponding fact for vector spaces. * Rank is additive over arbitrary direct sums: ::\\\\operatorname{rank}\\\\left(\\\\bigoplus_{j\\\\in J}A_j\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J}\\\\operatorname{rank}(A_j), : where the sum in the right hand side uses cardinal arithmetic.  Groups of higher rank  Abelian groups of rank greater than 1 are sources of interesting examples. For instance, for every cardinal d there exist torsion-free abelian groups of rank d that are indecomposable, i.e. cannot be expressed as a direct sum of a pair of their proper subgroups. These examples demonstrate that torsion-free abelian group of rank greater than 1 cannot be simply built by direct sums from torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1, whose theory is well understood. Moreover, for every integer n\\\\ge 3, there is a torsion-free abelian group of rank 2n-2 that is simultaneously a sum of two indecomposable groups, and a sum of n indecomposable groups. Hence even the number of indecomposable summands of a group of an even rank greater or equal than 4 is not well-defined. Another result about non-uniqueness of direct sum decompositions is due to A.L.S. Corner: given integers n\\\\ge k\\\\ge 1, there exists a torsion-free abelian group A of rank n such that for any partition n = r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_k into k natural summands, the group A is the direct sum of k indecomposable subgroups of ranks r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_k. Thus the sequence of ranks of indecomposable summands in a certain direct sum decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank is very far from being an invariant of A. Other surprising examples include torsion-free rank 2 groups An,m and Bn,m such that An is isomorphic to Bn if and only if n is divisible by m. For abelian groups of infinite rank, there is an example of a group K and a subgroup G such that * K is indecomposable; * K is generated by G and a single other element; and * Every nonzero direct summand of G is decomposable. Generalization The notion of rank can be generalized for any module M over an integral domain R, as the dimension over R0, the quotient field, of the tensor product of the module with the field: ::\\\\text{rank} (M)=\\\\dim_{R_0} M\\\\otimes_R R_0 It makes sense, since R0 is a field, and thus any module (or, to be more specific, vector space) over it is free. It is a generalization, since any abelian group is a module over the integers. It easily follows that the dimension of the product over Q is the cardinality of maximal linearly independent subset, since for any torsion element x and any rational q ::x\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf Z} q = 0 See also *Rank of a group References Abelian group theory ","title":"Rank of an abelian group"},{"id":"244543","text":", also known as Freeza in Funimation's English subtitles and Viz Media's release of the manga, is a fictional character and villain in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Frieza makes his debut in Chapter #247: , first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on October 24, 1989,Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump #47 October 24, 1989 as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe. Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the Dragon Ball franchise due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story due to the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, the first death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy, and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever. Frieza later appeared as the primary antagonist in the theatrical film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' and as an antagonist and recurring character in Dragon Ball Super.  Creation and conception  Frieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, often rendering the planet's population extinct first, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \\"worst kind of people.\\" Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close. Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character's name is a pun on freezer, and because of this, his minions and the members of the Ginyu Force are named after fruits and dairy products, items one would normally put in a refrigerator. The Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that Frieza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Y≈´ Kond≈ç. Frieza so far possesses five transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous ones. It is implied that Frieza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it,Vegeta: \\"There are some beings who change their shape as the need arises... for camouflage... to conserve energy.\\" / Frieza: \\"Or, in my case, because I become so powerful I can't keep myself under control!\\" (Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 102) while the fifth one unleashes his true power. Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Frieza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Frieza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many. Ry≈´sei Nakao has been Freeza's voice actor in all media. = Voice actors = In the original Japanese version, Frieza is voiced by Ry≈´sei Nakao in every single piece of Dragon Ball media. In English, Frieza was voiced by Pauline Newstone in the Ocean dub of Dragon Ball Z. In Funimation's in house English dub, Frieza was voiced by Linda Young in the original Dragon Ball series and continued playing him in all subsequent media up until the first episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai. He has since been voiced by Christopher Ayres in all media. Due to Ayres being diagnosed with end-stage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and requiring a double lung transplant, he was voiced by his understudy Daman Mills beginning with the Universal Survival Saga of Dragon Ball Super. Following his treatment, Ayres returned to voice Frieza for the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly. Appearances =Dragon Ball= Before the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta, after Beerus' authorization, out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan. Frieza spares only Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz, offering them wealth for their loyalty. However, when Raditz's father made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan's second son being sent to Earth where he became known as Goku. Frieza makes his official appearance in the story after Vegeta's defeat on Earth at Goku's hands, having traveled to Planet Namek to find the seven Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. He and his men massacre Namekian villages one after another, until Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta begin to hamper his efforts in their own way. Though Frieza manages to gain the Dragon Balls, with the Ginyu Force dealing with the interlopers, his inability to speak Namekian forces him to find the Great Elder of Namek. Frieza ends up fighting Namekian warrior Nail, whom he beats repeatedly until Nail reveals that their fight was only to buy time for Dende to give the words needed to activate the Namekian Dragon Balls, for the warriors from Earth. With his entire army killed by Vegeta and the Ginyu Force defeated by Goku, Frieza intercepts Vegeta and the others personally. Enraged to find he is too late, as the Dragon Balls have become inert on Guru's death Frieza briefly battles Vegeta, with the Saiyan Prince goading him into transforming and revealing his true power. Frieza transforms into his second form, and during the battle he finally admits to be the one who had destroyed the planet where the Saiyans had settled. After defeating Vegeta, Frieza takes on Piccolo, who has at this point fused with Nail. Although Piccolo appears to be even with him, he transforms into his third form and dominates the powerful Namekian. Following a brief tussle with Gohan, Frieza decides to transform into his final form. He kills Dende to stop him from healing the others and mortally wounds Vegeta just as Goku arrives, who just recovered following his fight with the Ginyu Force. Frieza fights Goku and the two seem evenly matched, but Frieza powers up to 50% of his maximum power and brutally beats him; however, Goku manages to seriously wound the tyrant with a Genki-Dama. In retaliation, Frieza then critically injures Piccolo and murders Krillin, which sends Goku over the edge to assume Super Saiyan form for the first time. After taking a vicious beating from Goku, Frieza damages the core of Namek in an act of desperation, knowing he can survive in vacuum. The tyrant then uses 100% of his power and briefly regains the advantage, but his power level begins to drop and he is ultimately sliced in half by one of his own attacks. Though Goku spares the crippled Frieza while leaving for his ship to escape the planet's destruction, Frieza attempts to blast Goku from behind, prompting Goku to retaliate with his own attack that apparently destroys Frieza. However, Frieza survives both the attack and Namek's explosion, and drifts through space until he is found by his father , who has him rebuilt with cybernetic prosthetics, increasing his strength significantly. A year later, Frieza and King Cold travel to Earth in order to exact revenge on Goku and his friends, but they are confronted by Trunks, Vegeta and Bulma's son from the future. After a brief battle, Frieza is sliced to pieces by Trunks and his remains blasted into oblivion, with his father following shortly afterwards. Though finally gone, Frieza's cells are used as a catalyst for the future villain Cell. =Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' / Dragon Ball Super= Ending up in Earth's Hell after being killed by Future Trunks, Frieza spends the next fourteen years being tortured by playful antics of an overly saccharine cadre of angels and fairies while reliving the memories of his defeats at the hands of Goku and Trunks. But Frieza is resurrected by Sorbet, who saw Frieza's return as essential to restore the Frieza Force to its former glory, and his right hand, Tagoma. The two then bring Frieza's disemboweled Mecha Frieza form to their ship, where they use their advanced medical technology to restore him to his full organic form. After learning that Goku defeated Majin Buu and fought Beerus to a stalemate, both being the two figures his father warned him never to cross, Frieza decides to undergo four months of intensive training. This led to him achieving a new form which he dubs \\"Golden Frieza\\" before setting off for Earth with his army. The Z Fighters hold back Tagoma and Frieza's minions long enough for Goku and Vegeta to return from their training session on Beerus's planet. Frieza executes his defeated army for their incompetence just as Goku, Vegeta, Beerus, and Whis arrive. Goku and Vegeta reveal their new Super Saiyan Blue forms, Frieza overpowering the former yet lacked the stamina for prolonged fight in his powered state as he is eventually cornered by Vegeta. Frieza destroys the Earth in retaliation for his defeat. but Whis rewinds time so Goku can quickly kill off Frieza. Frieza returns to Hell, where he is once more tormented by the angels. Frieza appears in the manga adaption omake alongside Sorbet and Susami in Hell. Frieza later returns in the Universal Tournament Arc as a replacement member for the Seventh Universe team after Majin Buu is ineligible to fight due to having fallen into a deep sleep from which nobody could wake him, revealed to have mentally trained himself maintain his Golden form. When approached by Goku, who is arranging him to be temporary revived by Fortuneteller Baba for a day, Frieza accepts the offer on the condition of being fully resurrected by the Dragon Balls after the tournament. Upon being revived, Frieza slaughters a group of assassins hired by the deities of the Ninth Universe to kill him while trapping Goku in a Destroyer-based energy attack meant for him. He then attempted to offer his services to the Ninth Universe deities in return for a place in their universe until Beerus and Whis appear. Despite Beerus's reservations, Goku vouches for him as they join the rest of their team. As the tournament commences, Frieza meets his Sixth Universe counterpart , a con artist who posed as a hero until a previous contest between the Seventh and Sixth Universes exposed his criminal activities and forced him into hiding. Frieza tricks Frost into believing they have forged an alliance to take out the Saiyans, proceeding to take out both the Ninth Universe's Roselle and the Tenth Universe's Murichim as the tournament commences. After eliminating Frost when he appears to commence their arrangement, Frieza eventually ends up being one of the four remaining combatants alongside Goku, Android 17 and Jiren of the Eleventh Universe. Frieza unexpectedly teams up with Goku to force Jiren out in a triple elimination with 17 declared the winner, resurrected soon after by Whis at Beerus's behest as a reward for his efforts. Frieza then takes his leave to begin rebuilding his empire. During the events of the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Frieza started to rebuild his forces while deciding to use Earth's Dragon Balls to make a wish to increase his height by five centimeters. Frieza recruited Broly and Paragus, who accompany him to Earth for the last Dragon Ball, realizing the former's potential as he matched Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms. This inspires Frieza to kill Paragus to force Broly's transformation into a Super Saiyan, only to be caught in Broly's rampage after the latter quickly defeats Goku. But Frieza is saved at the last second by Gogeta, who thwarts his attempt to kill off his former subordinates Chilai and Lemo when they used the Dragon Balls to save Broly's life with Frieza falling back while vowing revenge.  Abilities  Frieza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, flying, and has quick reflexes.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 100 Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as Ki and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Frieza's signature ki techniques include the , a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the , a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek and previous to that, Planet Vegeta. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode. Frieza's power was so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength.While other beings in Dragon Ball transform to increase their power, Frieza transforms to control and contain it. His true form is his fourth form (Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 10, chapter 109), with each of his other transformations meant to restrict his power and conceal it from his enemies. Frieza even says upon transforming to his second state that he has a harder time controlling himself and his power due to the immensity of his current strength (Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 102). While changing shape from his \\"first-form\\", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes, although the two transformed states (along with his first form) were merely to suppress Frieza's power, and that his third transformed state is actually his true form, while a fourth further transformation that he discovered after his four months of training actually increases his power drastically and lets out most of his latent strength. ;First form Frieza's first three forms, from right to left. In his weakest form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid with a large chestnut-shaped skull and two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 5, chapter 50 Frieza wears the same upper- body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his \\"dirty work\\". Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Frieza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets.Bardock: The Father of Goku, ¬©1990 Bird Studio/Toei Animation/Funimation Entertainment While shifting to his next stage, Frieza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders. Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also initially appears in this form. ;Second form His second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass. He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 102) In this form, Frieza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan. However, Frieza notices that Piccolo's power level is about equal to his own level, leaving Frieza with no choice but to transform again. This form largely resembles his father, King Cold. Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart Frost also takes on a second form, however it bears a greater resemblance to Frieza's third form and is said to be the equivalent of it by Piccolo. ;Third form Frieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like an Alien). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head. Despite his increased bulk, Frieza's speed is significantly higher in this form, easily outpacing Piccolo even after the Namek fighter removed his weighted training clothes. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Krillin, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch. Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 10, chapter 108 ;Fourth form Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form, Frieza's third form (being more like a shell for this final form) cracks and shatters open, revealing a shorter and less bulky appearance. His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins. All injuries taken in other forms are healed. This is the form that allows him to release his full potential. Frieza is also able to attain 100% power of this form, his muscle mass becoming engorged compared to his previously sleek frame.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 11, chapter 127 This is the peak of Frieza's natural potential, and the maximum amount of power his body can output. This form gives Frieza enough strength and speed to make even Super Saiyan Goku struggle; however, to obtain such power, Frieza's body is subjected to a muscle strain, which slowly lowers his energy, reducing his speed until he cannot compete with Super Saiyan Goku anymore. This transformation is therefore not suitable for prolonged combat, with Frieza trying to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying Planet Namek.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 11, chapter 131 Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also briefly uses this form during the Tournament of Power. ;Mecha Frieza After being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek's huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Frieza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold; this form is referred to as in video games. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self. It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful. However, he was never able to unleash his full power in this form, since he was quickly destroyed by Trunks.Frieza: \\"With the two of us together, it will be no trouble. I could probably do it by myself, since I've grown even more powerful.\\" (Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 136) ;Golden Frieza Frieza attains another transformation in the 2015 film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F and Dragon Ball Super. According to Frieza, his fifth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand).Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no F manga, chapter April 1 issue of 2015 V-Jump February 21, 2015 In this form, Frieza's physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms and shins, thus he is known as in this form. In this form at peak power, Frieza is able to overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan Blue form with relative ease. But the power-up drains his energy much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form, due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is also unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms. After his second revival, Frieza reveals he mastered his Golden form due to intense meditation while in hell. This \\"True Golden Frieza\\" can be used indefinitely without any drain on Frieza's stamina or even while he is barely conscious. Frieza's Japanese voice actor, Ry≈´sei Nakao jokingly placed Golden Frieza's power level at ‚Äúone hundred quintillion‚Äù (or 1.2 billion times stronger than the Fourth form). In Dragon Ball Heroes there is a version of Golden Frieza called \\"Rage Golden Frieza\\" which is an empowered version of Golden Frieza fuelled by Rage which also appears in Super as well.  Appearances in other media  In numerous filler episodes of the anime and Dragon Ball GT, Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief, causing trouble in Hell, having somehow been permitted to keep his body despite his wrongdoings. In Hell, he is defeated and sent to prison by Goku and Pikkon along with Cell, his father and the Ginyu Force, and he is later seen watching Goku's final battle with Majin Buu in a crystal ball, comically hoping for Goku to lose (this appearance is later contradicted in Resurrection \\"F\\" and its Dragon Ball Super adaptation, where Frieza is depicted as unaware that Goku fought and defeated Buu, although for flashback sequences and such, Super alludes to Dragon Ball Z Kai, where most filler material has been cut). In Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn, Frieza briefly escapes from Hell with an army of villains to attack Earth, but he is swiftly defeated by Gohan. In Dragon Ball GT, when Goku is sent to Hell by accident, Frieza and Cell confront him, their bodies having been rendered temporarily immortal due to the unbalance between the two worlds. Using a joint attack, Frieza and Cell send Goku to a lower level where he is frozen by a witch, but the two villains end up frozen themselves when they foolishly venture downwards to gloat at Goku. Goku accidentally breaks the ice holding Frieza and Cell and it shatters to pieces, implying that Frieza and Cell have been erased from existence. However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths and appear in the live action GT show where he and Cell gained new forms to track down Goku. He appeared in a TV ad for Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, as he makes a non-speaking appearance in the film. He also appears in a chapter of Toriyama's Neko Majin manga, published in August 2003, which also introduces Frieza's son, . He briefly appears in the 2006 Dragon Ball crossover chapter, , of Osamu Akimoto's manga Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo. Frieza appears in Naho ≈åishi's 2011 Dragon Ball spin-off manga Episode of Bardock, but it predominately features his ancestor . He also appears in Toriyama's 2014 Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child special. Frieza has made numerous appearances in other media. The Japanese nu metal/hardcore punk band Maximum the Hormone released the song \\"F\\" as part of a double A-side single on July 9, 2008. The entirety of the song references Frieza, with the single itself rising as high as number two on the Oricon music chart. The song was the source of reference used by Toriyama for the title of the film Fukkatsu no F and is featured in the movie. Seikima-II frontman Demon Kakka wrote and performed the song that appeared in two episodes of Dragon Ball Kai and on the 2009 Dragon Ball Kai Song Collection album. In the manga Black Cat, the character Sven Vollfied is often seen using his cell phone with a wrist strap of a miniature-sized badge of Frieza's head.Black Cat manga, chapter 6, page 153 A caricature of Frieza mixed with a grey alien was parodied as a mech pilot in an episode of Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi. The anime Yakitate!! Japan featured a spoof re-enactment of the fight between Goku and Frieza, with a character clad in a refrigerator representing the latter. The Cartoon Network show Codename: Kids Next Door had a parody of their own of the climactic fight and the Frieza character, with the Delightful Children From Down the Lane portraying him as a multi-headed monstrosity. = Video games = Frieza has been featured in many of the video games based on the series. Often, he's both a playable character and boss, though more frequently the latter. He is also usually able to transform into his many different forms. Frieza appears in the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiyajin Zetsumetsu Keikaku. Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, and he and other past villains start attacking Goku and his friends. Once it's revealed these are merely ghost- warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with. Other games highlight Frieza in alternate story paths; including those where he successfully attains immortality and goes on to threaten Earth such as Dragon Ball Z: Budokai, and Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2 where Frieza and Cell are resurrected and controlled by Bobbidi as a distraction for the player. Frieza also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games Jump Ultimate Stars, Battle Stadium D.O.N, J-Stars Victory Vs and Jump Force. Reception Y≈´ Kond≈ç, Toriyama's second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that Dragon Ball hit its peak in popularity during the Frieza arc. In a one- thousand ballot popularity poll held in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, Dragon Ball received 815 of them. In 2004, fans of the series voted Frieza the ninth most popular character for a poll in the book Dragon Ball Forever. Frieza was mentioned as one of the \\"most beloved characters\\" in an article by GamePro. The casting and direction of his English voices has often been criticized over the years, with IGN's Ramsey Isler writing that, coupled with the ambiguous physical features, the \\"old lady\\" voice lead to some gender confusion with fans. The Ledger's December 8, 1999 paper names him as one of the reasons that Dragon Ball Z was listed as a violent show for children, stating, \\"In one recent episode, beads of sweat form on the brow of a character named Vegeta, as he is nearly strangled to death by an evil foe named Frieza. In another, Frieza uses the horns on his head to impale a good guy named Krillin through the chest.\\" The paper also comments on Frieza's appearance: \\"Little Gohan is abruptly in the icy metallic grip of one of his arch-nemeses [sic], Frieza, a silvery androgynous giant who looks like a cross between the monster in Alien and Batman's Mr. Freeze.\\"  Bibliography  *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 5 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 6 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 7 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 8 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 9 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 10 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 11 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 12 ‚Äî References Animated series villains Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Dragon Ball characters Comics characters introduced in 1989 Extraterrestrial supervillains Fictional extraterrestrial characters Fictional amputees Fictional characters with energy- manipulation abilities Fictional child killers Fictional cyborgs Fictional dictators Fictional characters who committed genocide Fictional mass murderers Fictional mutants Fictional shapeshifters Fictional telekinetics Fictional torturers Fictional warlords Galactic emperors Male characters in anime and manga Video game bosses pl:Lista postaci wystƒôpujƒÖcych w Dragon Ball#Freezer ","title":"Frieza"},{"id":"244549","text":"Matsunaga Hisahide, by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. A view over T≈çdai-ji, Mountains of Wakakusa, Mikasa and Kasuga from Tamon Castle site Before killing himself, Hisahide breaking the chagama which Oda Nobunaga wanted. Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide (ÊùæÊ∞∏ ÂºæÊ≠£ ‰πÖÁßÄ 1508 - November 19, 1577) was a daimy≈ç and head of the Yamato Matsunaga clan in Japan during the Sengoku period of the 16th century.Matsunaga clan Biography He was a retainer of Miyoshi Nagayoshi from the 1540s. He directed the conquest of the province of Yamato in the 1560s and by 1564 had built a sufficient power-base to be effectively independent. It is believed that he was conspiring against Nagayoshi during this period, from 1561 to 1563 three of Nagayoshi's brothers and his son Yoshioki died. This left Miyoshi Yoshitsugu the adopted heir when Nagayoshi died in 1564, too young to rule. Three men shared his guardianship ‚Äì Miyoshi Nagayuki, Miyoshi Masayasu, and Iwanari Tomomichi. He then invaded the sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru's palace, who then committed suicide. His brother Ashikaga Yoshiaki fled and the sh≈çgun was replaced by his young cousin, Yoshihide. In 1566, fighting started between Hisahide and the Miyoshi. Initially the forces of Hisahide were unsuccessful and his apparent destruction of the Buddhist T≈çdai-ji in Nara was considered an act of infamy. In 1568 Oda Nobunaga, with the figurehead Yoshiaki, attacked Hisahide. Nobunaga captured Kyoto in November and Hisahide was forced to submit. Yoshiaki was made sh≈çgun, a post he held only until 1573 when he attempted to remove himself from Nobunaga's power. Hisahide kept control of the Yamato and served Nobunaga in his extended campaigns against the Miyoshi and others, for a while. In 1573 Hisahide briefly allied with the Miyoshi, but when the hope for successes were not achieved he returned to Nobunaga to fight the Miyoshi. In 1577 Nobunaga besieged him at Shigisan Castle. Defeated but defiant Hisahide committed suicide. A noted tea master, he destroyed his tea bowl denying it to his enemies. He ordered his head destroyed to prevent it becoming a trophy (in which his son, Matsunaga Kojiro grabbed Hisahide's head and jumped off the castle wall with his sword through his throat). His son, Hisamichi, also committed suicide in siege. Hisahide often appears as a shriveled and scheming old man in fiction. However, this is a fictitious image propagated in response to the assassinations and the destruction of T≈çdai-ji that he was believed to have perpetrated.

It functioned by careful manipulation of water through a room full of interconnected pipes and pumps. The water level in various chambers (with precision to fractions of a millimeter) represented stored numbers, and the rate of flow between them represented mathematical operations. This machine was capable of solving inhomogeneous differential equations.Genesis Machines. The new science of biocomputing, , from Martyn Amos, Atlantic Books, 2006, Ch. 2., Birth of the Machines, ff. The first versions of Lukyanov's integrators were rather experimental, made of tin and glass tubes, and each integrator could be used to solve only one problem. In the 1930s it was the only computer in the Soviet Union for solving partial differential equations. In 1941, Lukyanov created a hydraulic integrator of modular design, which made it possible to assemble a machine for solving various problems. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional hydraulic integrators were designed. In 1949‚Äì1955, an integrator in the form of standard unified units was developed at the NIISCHETMASH Institute. In 1955, the Ryazan plant of calculating and analytical machines began the serial production of integrators with the factory brand name ‚ÄúIGL‚Äù (russian: Integrator Gidrawliczeskij ≈Åukianowa - integrator of the Lukyanov hydraulic system). Integrators were widely distributed, delivered to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and China. A water integrator was used in the design of the Karakum Canal in the 1940s, and the construction of the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline in the 1970s. Water analog computers were used in the Soviet Union until the 1980s for large-scale modelling. They were used in geology, mine construction, metallurgy, rocket production and other fields. Currently, two hydraulic integrators are kept in the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow.

Generators are objects which cover other objects as an approximation, and (dually) cogenerators are objects which envelope other objects as an approximation. More precisely: * A generator of a category with a zero object is an object G such that for every nonzero object H there exists a nonzero morphism f:G ‚Üí H. * A cogenerator is an object C such that for every nonzero object H there exists a nonzero morphism f:H ‚Üí C. (Note the reversed order). The abelian group case Assuming one has a category like that of abelian groups, one can in fact form direct sums of copies of G until the morphism :f: Sum(G) ->H is surjective; and one can form direct products of C until the morphism :f:H-> Prod(C) is injective. For example, the integers are a generator of the category of abelian groups (since every abelian group is a quotient of a free abelian group). This is the origin of the term generator. The approximation here is normally described as generators and relations. As an example of a cogenerator in the same category, we have Q/Z, the rationals modulo the integers, which is a divisible abelian group. Given any abelian group A, there is an isomorphic copy of A contained inside the product of A copies of Q/Z. This approximation is close to what is called the divisible envelope - the true envelope is subject to a minimality condition. General theory Finding a generator of an abelian category allows one to express every object as a quotient of a direct sum of copies of the generator. Finding a cogenerator allows one to express every object as a subobject of a direct product of copies of the cogenerator. One is often interested in projective generators (even finitely generated projective generators, called progenerators) and minimal injective cogenerators. Both examples above have these extra properties. The cogenerator Q/Z is useful in the study of modules over general rings. If H is a left module over the ring R, one forms the (algebraic) character module H* consisting of all abelian group homomorphisms from H to Q/Z. H* is then a right R-module. Q/Z being a cogenerator says precisely that H* is 0 if and only if H is 0. Even more is true: the * operation takes a homomorphism :f:H -> K to a homomorphism :f*:K* -> H*, and f* is 0 if and only if f is 0. It is thus a faithful contravariant functor from left R-modules to right R-modules. Every H* is pure-injective (also called algebraically compact). One can often consider a problem after applying the * to simplify matters. All of this can also be done for continuous modules H: one forms the topological character module of continuous group homomorphisms from H to the circle group R/Z. In general topology The Tietze extension theorem can be used to show that an interval is an injective cogenerator in a category of topological spaces subject to separation axioms.

It was designed by Dave Theurer, who also designed Atari's vector graphics game Tempest from the same year. The 1981 Atari 2600 port of Missile Command by Rob Fulop sold over 2.5 million copies. Plot The player's six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. New weapons are introduced in later levels: smart bombs that can evade a less-than-perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen launching missiles of their own. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed. Gameplay The game is played by moving a crosshair across the sky background via a trackball and pressing one of three buttons to launch a counter-missile from the appropriate battery. Counter-missiles explode upon reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a missile battery becomes useless when all its missiles are fired, or if the battery is destroyed by enemy fire. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance. The game is staged as a series of levels of increasing difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy weapons. The weapons attack the six cities, as well as the missile batteries; being struck by an enemy weapon results in the destruction of the city or missile battery. Enemy weapons are only able to destroy three cities during one level. A level ends when all enemy weaponry is destroyed or reaches its target. A player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level. At the conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for any remaining cities (50 points times scoring level, 1 to 6, first 254 levels; 256, levels 255 & 256) or unused missiles (5 points times scoring level, 1 to 6, first 254 levels; 256, levels 255 & 256). Between levels missile batteries are rebuilt and replenished; destroyed cities are rebuilt only at set point levels (usually per 8,000 to 12,000 points). The game inevitably ends when all six cities are destroyed, unless the player manages to score enough points to earn a bonus city before the end of the level. Like most early arcade games, there is no way to \\"win\\" the game; the game keeps going with ever-faster and more prolific incoming missiles. The game, then, is just a contest in seeing how long the player can survive. On conclusion of the game, the screen displays \\"The End\\", rather than \\"Game Over\\", signifying that \\"[i]n the end, all is lost. There is no winner.\\" This conclusion is skipped, however, if the player makes the high score list and the game prompts the player to enter his/her initials. The game features an interesting bug: upon scoring 810,000 (and per 1,000,000 points thereafter), a large number of cities are awarded (176 cities plus the continuing accrual of bonus cities) and it is possible to carry on playing for several hours. At some later stage the speed of missiles increases greatly for a few screens. On the 255th and 256th yellow screens, known as the 0x stages, the scoring increases by 256 times the base value. For good players these two 0x stages could earn over a million points. This enabled them to reach a score of approximately 2,800,000 (although only six-digit scores were shown, so it would display 800,000) and at this point the accelerated rate would suddenly cease and the game would restart at its original (slow) speed and return to the first stage, but with the score and any saved cities retained. In this way it was possible to play this game for hours on end. Development When the game was originally designed, the six cities were meant to represent six cities in California: Eureka, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Later in development the names of the cities varied depending on the game level being played, but eventually city names were removed completely. While programming Missile Command, the lead programmer, Dave Theurer, suffered from nightmares of these cities being destroyed by a nuclear blast.Blue Wizard Is About To Die!, Pg. 140, Seth Flynn Barkan, Extra Credits: Narrative Mechanics Ports Atari 5200 version Missile Command was ported to the Atari 2600 in 1981.Missile Command arcade video game by Atari, Inc. (1980) The game's instruction manual describes a war between two planets: Zardon (the defending player) and Krytol. The original arcade game contains no reference to these worlds. On level 13, if the player uses all of his or her missiles without scoring any points, at the end of the game the city on the right will turn into \\"RF\\" -- the initials of the programmer Rob Fulop. This Easter egg is originally documented in Atari Age (Volume 1, Issue 2) in a letter to the editor by Joseph Nickischer, and is the second one publicly acknowledged by Atari. Missile Command was released for the Atari 8-bit family in 1981 and an identical version for the Atari 5200 in 1982. The same Atari 8-bit port was later used in the 1987 Atari XEGS as a built-in game that boots up if there isn't a cartridge or keyboard in the console. Reception Missile Command is considered one of the great classic video games from the Golden Age of Arcade Games. The game is also interesting in its manifestation of the Cold War's effects on popular culture, in that the game features an implementation of National Missile Defense and parallels real life nuclear war. In 1983, Softline readers named Missile Command for the Atari 8-bit family eighth on the magazine's Top Thirty list of Atari programs by popularity. Legacy =Re-releases= Missile Command has also been included in the compilations Atari Arcade Hits 1, Atari Anniversary Edition, and Atari: 80 Classic Games in One!. It was released as part of the original Microsoft Arcade for the PC in 1993. It was also included in some compilations on Sega consoles: Arcade Smash Hits on the Master System, Arcade Classics on Game Boy Retails 4 Published by Nintendo, Arcade Classics on Game Gear and Arcade Classics on Genesis. =Sequels= In late 1980, a two-player sequel Missile Command 2 was field tested but never releasedMissile Command 2 - Videogame by Atari, arcade-museum.com although at least one prototype appeared in an arcade in Santa Clara, California. This game was similar to the original except that each player had their own set of cities and missile batteries and the players could cooperate to save each other's cities from the onslaught. In 1992, Atari developed a prototype of an arcade game called Arcade Classics for their 20th anniversary, which included Missile Command 2 and Super Centipede. In 1981, an enhancement kit was made by General Computer Corp. to convert Missile Command into Super Missile Attack. This made the game even harder, and added a UFO to the player's enemies. In 1982 Atari released a game called Liberator, which was seen by some as being a sequel to Missile Command with the situation essentially reversed; in Liberator, the player is the one attacking planetary bases from orbit.Liberator - Videogame by Atari, arcade- museum.com =Updated versions= Missile Command for the Xbox 360 Enhanced versions of Missile Command were released for the Atari Lynx and Game Boy. An updated version called Missile Command 3D was released for the Atari Jaguar in 1995. It contains three versions of the game: Classic (a straight port of the arcade game), 3D (graphically upgraded and with a rotating viewpoint), and Virtual. It is the only game that works with the virtual reality helmet from Virtuality. Hasbro Interactive released a 3D remake of Missile Command for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 1999. Missile Command with high- definition graphics was released via Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 on July 4, 2007. On September 23, 2008, Missile Command was released for the iPhone and iPod Touch for US$5. It includes two gameplay modes (\\"Ultra\\" and \\"Classic\\"). On March 26, 2020, Atari released a new remake, Missle Command: Recharged, on mobile platforms. On May 27, the remake also made it to Nintendo Switch as well as home computers via Steam, later on releasing as a launch title on the Atari VCShttps://www.gameinformer.com/2020/07/01/ataris-new- console-the-vcs-launches-this-fall title=Atari's New Console, The VCS, Launches this Fall An updated version of the game was announced in 2018 for the Intellivision Amico. =Clones= Contemporary Missile Command clones include Missile Defense (1981) for the Apple II, Stratos (1982) for the TRS-80, Repulsar (1983) for the ZX Spectrum, and Barrage (1983) for the TI-99/4A. Silas Warner programmed the 1980 clone ABM for the Apple II several years before writing Castle Wolfenstein. Similarly, John Field programmed the Missile Command-like game ICBM (1981), then went on to create Axis Assassin, one of the first five games published by Electronic Arts. Atomic Command, a clone of Missile Command, is playable on the Pip-Boy interface in the Fallout 4 video game.Atomic Command (Missile Command) Retro Game in Fallout 4 Gameplay, Youtube =In popular culture= * Missile Command was referenced in the 1980 episode \\"Call Girl\\" of the TV sitcom Barney Miller, which features a detective who is hooked on the game. * In the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, John Connor plays the game in an arcade. *The documentary High Score (2006) follows William Carlton, a Portland, Oregon gamer, on his quest to beat the Missile Command high score record for Marathon settings. * In the 2008 episode \\"Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer\\" of the NBC show Chuck, a weapons satellite access code is hidden in the (fictitious) kill screen of Missile Command by its programmer, the fictional Mr. Morimoto (Clyde Kusatsu). * In the 1982 movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Missile Commands \\"The End\\" screen is used to help illustrate the film's ending. =Film= In February 2010, Atari announced that it was talking with several studios to find one that would turn Missile Command into a movie. On January 11, 2011, 20th Century Fox announced that it had acquired the rights to bring Missile Command to film. In May 2016, it was announced that Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films has closed a deal to partner with Atari to produce and finance both Centipede and Missile Command. World records Two types of world record are monitored for the arcade version of Missile Command: Marathon settings and Tournament settings. Both settings allow the player to start with six cities. Marathon settings give the player additional bonus cities, allowing seasoned players to play the game, in theory, indefinitely. In tournament mode, no bonus cities are awarded at any point in the game; the game ends when all six cities are destroyed. =Marathon settings= In 1981, Floridian Jody Bowles played a Missile Command arcade game for 30 hours at The Filling Station Eatery in Pensacola. Bowles racked up 41,399,845 points with only one quarter using Marathon Settings, besting the previous known record, according to Atari spokesman Mike Fournell.Man Plays Video Game 30 Hours To Win Record With One Quarter. Ocala Star-Banner. 4 May 1981. The record was broken when Victor Ali of the United States scored 80,364,995 points in 1982. It is believed that Ali played the game continuously for 56 hours. Beginning on March 15, 2013 Victor Sandberg of Sweden surpassed all previous records live on Twitch with a final score of 81,796,035 points after 56 hours of play.DiskborsteMC's Twitch.tv channel On December 27, 2013, Sandberg started a new world record attempt which ended after 71 hours and 41 minutes on December 30, culminating in a score of 103,809,990 on level 10,432, 10 points short of getting an additional 176 cities (see 'gameplay' above). =Tournament settings= On March 9, 2006, Tony Temple, a UK-based gamer, set a world record for Missile Command in Tournament mode confirmed by Twin Galaxies. His score of 1,967,830 points beat the record previously held by US gamer Roy Shildt for more than 20 years. Shildt maintains that he played using slightly different settings to Temple, even though the particular setting he refers to would not have been monitored at the time he set his record; this according to the official Guinness manuals from that era. Temple's record was recognized by the Official Video Game & Pinball Book of World Records and was listed in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records, as well as the Guinness Gamers Edition Book 2008. Tony Temple has subsequently increased his world record on two occasions, culminating in a score of 4,472,570 verified on 9 September 2010. This score took 2 hours 57 minutes, and represents the first officially verified time that a player has passed the highest level at wave 256 on Missile Command under tournament settings, the game difficulty starts over at level 1 again.

A corrosive substance is one that will damage or destroy other substances with which it comes into contact by means of a chemical reaction. Etymology The word corrosive is derived from the Latin verb corrodere, which means to gnaw, indicating how these substances seem to \\"gnaw\\" their way through flesh or other materials. Chemical terms The word corrosive refers to any chemical that will dissolve the structure of an object. They can be acids, oxidizers, or bases. When they come in contact with a surface, the surface deteriorates. The deterioration can happen in minutes, e.g. concentrated hydrochloric acid spilled on skin; or slowly over days or years, e.g. the rusting of iron in a bridge. Sometimes the word caustic is used as a synonym for corrosive when referring to the effect on living tissues. At low concentrations, a corrosive substance is called an irritant, and its effect on living tissue is called irritation. At high concentrations, a corrosive substance causes a chemical burn, a distinct type of tissue damage. Corrosives are different from poisons in that corrosives are immediately dangerous to the tissues they contact, whereas poisons may have systemic toxic effects that require time to become evident. Colloquially, corrosives may be called poisons but the concepts are technically distinct. However, there is nothing which precludes a corrosive from being a poison; there are substances that are both corrosives and poisons. Corrosion of non- living surfaces such as metals is a distinct process. For example, a water-air electrochemical cell corrodes iron to rust, corrodes copper to patina, and corrodes copper, silver, and other metals to tarnish. In the international system of symbolic chemical labels, both rapid corrosion of metals and chemical corrosion of skin qualify for the corrosive symbol. Effects on living tissue Common corrosives are either strong acids, strong bases, or concentrated solutions of certain weak acids or weak bases. They can exist as any state of matter, including liquids, solids, gases, mists or vapors. Their action on living tissue (e.g. skin, flesh and cornea) is mainly based on acid- base reactions of amide hydrolysis, ester hydrolysis and protein denaturation. Proteins (chemically composed of amide bonds) are destroyed via amide hydrolysis while lipids (which have ester bonds) are decomposed by ester hydrolysis. These reactions lead to chemical burns and are the mechanism of the destruction posed by corrosives. Some corrosives possess other chemical properties which may extend their corrosive effects on living tissue. For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at a high concentration is also a strong dehydrating agent, capable of dehydrating carbohydrates and liberating extra heat. This results in secondary thermal burns in addition to the chemical burns and may speed up its decomposing reactions on the contact surface. Some corrosives, such as nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, are strong oxidizing agents as well, which significantly contributes to the extra damage caused. Hydrofluoric acid does not necessarily cause noticeable damage upon contact, but produces tissue damage and toxicity after being painlessly absorbed. Zinc chloride solutions are capable of destroying cellulose and corroding through paper and silk since the zinc cations in the solutions specifically attack hydroxyl groups, acting as a Lewis acid. This effect is not restricted to acids; so strong a base as calcium oxide, which has a strong affinity for water (forming calcium hydroxide, itself a strong and corrosive base), also releases heat capable of contributing thermal burns as well as delivering the corrosive effects of a strong alkali to moist flesh. In addition, some corrosive chemicals, mostly acids such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, are volatile and can emit corrosive mists upon contact with air. Inhalation can damage the respiratory tract. Corrosive substances are most hazardous to eyesight. A drop of a corrosive may cause blindness within 2‚Äì10 seconds through opacification or direct destruction of the cornea. Ingestion of corrosives can induce severe consequences, including serious damage of the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to vomiting, severe stomach aches, and death. Common types Common corrosive chemicals are classified into: * Acids **Strong acidsthe most common are sulfuric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid (H2SO4, HNO3 and HCl, respectively). **Some concentrated weak acids, for example formic acid, acetic acid, and phosphoric acid **Strong Lewis acids such as anhydrous aluminum chloride and boron trifluoride **Lewis acids with specific reactivity; e.g., solutions of zinc chloride **Extremely strong acids (superacids) * Bases **Caustics or alkalis, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide **Alkali metals in the metallic form (e.g. elemental sodium), and hydrides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium hydride, function as strong bases and hydrate to give caustics **Extremely strong bases (superbases) such as alkoxides, metal amides (e.g. sodium amide) and organometallic bases such as butyllithium **Fully alkalized salts of weak acids such as trisodium phosphate **Some concentrated weak bases, such as ammonia when anhydrous or in a concentrated solution * Dehydrating agents such as concentrated sulfuric acid, phosphorus pentoxide, calcium oxide, anhydrous zinc chloride, also elemental alkali metals * Strong oxidizers such as concentrated hydrogen peroxide * Electrophilic halogens: elemental fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and electrophilic salts such as sodium hypochlorite or N-chloro compounds such as chloramine-T; halide ions are not corrosive, except for fluoride * Organic halides and organic acid halides such as acetyl chloride and benzyl chloroformate * Acid anhydrides * Alkylating agents such as dimethyl sulfate * Some organic materials such as phenol (\\"carbolic acid\\") Personal protective equipment Use of personal protective equipment, including items such as protective gloves, protective aprons, acid suits, safety goggles, a face shield, or safety shoes, is normally recommended when handling corrosive substances. Users should consult a safety data sheet for the specific recommendation for the corrosive substance of interest. The material of construction of the personal protective equipment is of critical importance as well. For example, although rubber gloves and rubber aprons may be made out of a chemically resistant elastomer such as nitrile rubber, neoprene, or butyl rubber, each of these materials has different resistance to different corrosives and they should not be substituted for each other. Uses Some corrosive chemicals are valued for various uses, the most common of which is in household cleaning agents. For example, most drain cleaners contain either acids or alkalis due to their capabilities of dissolving greases, proteins or mineral deposits such as limescale inside water pipes. In chemical uses, high chemical reactivity is often desirable, as the rates of chemical reactions depend on the activity (effective concentration) of the reactive species. For instance, catalytic sulfuric acid is used in the alkylation process in an oil refinery: the activity of carbocations, the reactive intermediate, is higher with stronger acidity, and thus the reaction proceeds faster. Once used, corrosives are most often recycled or neutralized. However, there have been environmental problems with untreated corrosive effluents or accidental discharges.

Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos,Dreyer (1953), pp.135‚Äì48; Linton (2004), pp.38‚Äì9). The work of Aristarchus' in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived. We only know of it now from a brief passage in Archimedes' The Sand Reckoner. but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus' heliocentrism attracted little attention‚Äîpossibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic period. It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope. With the observations of William Herschel, Friedrich Bessel, and other astronomers, it was realized that the Sun, while near the barycenter of the Solar System, was not at any center of the Universe. Ancient and medieval astronomy A hypothetical geocentric model of the Solar System (upper panel) in comparison to the heliocentric model (lower panel). While the sphericity of the Earth was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 4th century BC, the Earth's daily rotation and yearly orbit around the Sun was never universally accepted until the Copernican Revolution. While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in Pythagoreanism, and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the geocentric model described in Ptolemy's Almagest. The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy., Chapter V, page 76 Ptolemy himself, in his Almagest, points out that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used. In Book 1 section 7 he admits that a model in which the Earth revolves with respect to the stars would be simpler but doesn't go as far as considering a heliocentric system. However, he rejected the idea of a spinning Earth as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. His planetary hypotheses were sufficiently real that the distances of the Moon, Sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits' celestial spheres as contiguous realities. This made the stars' distance less than 20 Astronomical Units,Dennis Duke, Ptolemy's Universe a regression, since Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier necessarily placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant. Problems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the Copernican heliocentrism developed in Renaissance astronomy. =Classical antiquity= Pythagoreans The non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the Universe was a \\"central fire\\", around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion. This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the \\"counter-earth\\" invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary.Boyer, C. A History of Mathematics. Wiley, p. 54. Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' \\"central fire\\" as the Sun, \\"as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings\\". Heraclides of Pontus (4th century BC) said that the rotation of the Earth explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed Mercury and Venus to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth. Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (AD 395‚Äì423) later described this as the \\"Egyptian System,\\" stating that \\"it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians,\\" though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt. Aristarchus of Samos Aristarchus' 3rd century BC calculations on the relative sizes of the Earth, Sun and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system was Aristarchus of Samos . Like his contemporary Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth and measured the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought that the larger object would have the most attractive force. His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, Archimedes, and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus' theory is given in the former's book, The Sand Reckoner. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which Thomas Heath translates as follows:Heath (1913, p. 302). The italics and parenthetical comments are as they appear in Heath's original. Aristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their parallaxThat is, an apparent movement of the stars relative to the celestial poles and equator, and to each other, caused by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful telescopes had been developed. No references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the common era. The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of Plutarch. These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes' accountAlthough it could obviously be reasonably inferred therefrom.‚Äînamely, that Aristarchus' theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in On the Face in the Orb of the Moon:Heath (1913, p. 304). Most modern scholars share Heath's opinion that it is Cleanthes in this passage who is being held as having accused Aristarchus of impiety (see Gent & Godwin 1883, p. 240; Dreyer 1906, p. 138; Prickard, 1911, p. 20; Cherniss 1957, p. 55; for example). The manuscripts of Plutarch's On the Face in the Orb of the Moon that have come down to us are corrupted, however, and the traditional interpretation of the passage has been challenged by Lucio Russo, who insists that it should be interpreted as having Aristarchus rhetorically suggest that Cleanthes was being impious for wanting to shift the Sun from its proper place at the center of the universe (Russo, 2013, p. 82; Russo & Medaglia, 1996, pp. 113‚Äì7). Only scattered fragments of Cleanthes' writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Diogenes La√´rtius lists A reply to Aristarchus (Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºàœÅŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÅœáŒøŒΩ) as one of Cleanthes' works,Hicks (1972, Bk 7, ch 5, p. 281) and some scholarsEdwards (1998, p. 68 and n. 104, p. 455), for instance. have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety. The second of the references by Plutarch is in his Platonic Questions:Heath (1913, p. 305). The remaining references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in A√´tius' Opinions of the Philosophers, Sextus Empiricus' Against the Mathematicians, and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle.Dreyer (1906, p. 139) Another passage in A√´tius' Opinions of the Philosophers reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus. Seleucus of Seleucia Since Plutarch mentions the \\"followers of Aristarchus\\" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a Hellenistic astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the Seleucid empire. Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus. Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. A fragment of a work by Seleucus has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by Rhazes (b. 865). Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of tides,Lucio Russo, Flussi e riflussi, Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, . which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the Moon and by the revolution of the Earth around the Earth and Moon's center of mass. Late Antiquity There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In Roman Carthage, the pagan Martianus Capella (5th century A.D.) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun.William Stahl, trans., Martianus Capella and the Seven Liberal Arts, vol. 2, The Marriage of Philology and Mercury, 854, 857, New York: Columbia Univ. Pr, 1977, pp. 332‚Äì3 Capella's model was discussed in the Early Middle Ages by various anonymous 9th-century commentators and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work. =Ancient India= The Ptolemaic system was also received in Indian astronomy. Aryabhata (476‚Äì550), in his magnum opus Aryabhatiya (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun. His immediate commentators, such as Lalla, and other later authors, rejected his innovative view about the turning Earth. He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the solar and lunar eclipses, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon. Early followers of Aryabhata's model included Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II. =Medieval Islamic world= For a time, Muslim astronomers accepted the Ptolemaic system and the geocentric model, which were used by to show that the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies. at pp. 317‚Äì18: In the 10th century, accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis. According to later astronomer al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe called al-z≈´raqƒ´ based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries that the apparent motion of the stars was due to the Earth's movement, and not that of the firmament. Islamic astronomers began to criticize the Ptolemaic model, including Ibn al-Haytham in his 'alƒÅ Ba·π≠alamiy≈´s (\\"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\\", c. 1028),Qadir (1989), p. 5‚Äì10. who branded it an impossibility.Nicolaus Copernicus, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2004). An illustration from al-Biruni's astronomical works explains the different phases of the Moon with respect to the position of the Sun. Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his Masudic Canon (1031), he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth.E. S. Kennedy, \\"Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´'s Masudic Canon\\", Al-Abhath, 24 (1971): 59‚Äì81; reprinted in David A. King and Mary Helen Kennedy, ed., Studies in the Islamic Exact Sciences, Beirut, 1983, pp. 573‚Äì595. He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations,G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff, P. Wolff, J. Naudu (1975). History of Mankind, Vol 3: The Great medieval Civilisations, p. 649. George Allen & Unwin Ltd, UNESCO. but considered it a problem of natural philosophy rather than one of mathematics.Saliba (1999). In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical. (PDF version) His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century. The Maragha school of astronomy in Ilkhanid-era Persia further developed \\"non-Ptolemaic\\" planetary models involving Earth's rotation. Notable astronomers of this school are Al-Urdi (d. 1266) Al-Katibi (d. 1277),Hikmat al-'Ain, p. 78 and Al-Tusi (d. 1274). The arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth's motion. The criticism of Ptolemy as developed by Averroes and by the Maragha school explicitly address the Earth's rotation but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism.Toby E. Huff (1993):The rise of early modern science: Islam, China, and the West The observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era Samarkand observatory under Qushji (1403‚Äì1474). =Later medieval period= Nicholas of Cusa, 15th century, asked whether there was any reason to assert that any point was the center of the universe. European scholarship in the later medieval period actively received astronomical models developed in the Islamic world and by the 13th century was well aware of the problems of the Ptolemaic model. In the 14th century, bishop Nicole Oresme discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in his Learned Ignorance asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe. In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that \\"Thus the fabric of the world (machina mundi) will quasi have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,\\"Nicholas of Cusa, De docta ignorantia, 2.12, p. 103, cited in Koyr√© (1957), p. 17. recalling Hermes Trismegistus. =Medieval India= In India, Nilakantha Somayaji (1444‚Äì1544), in his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, developed a computational system for a geo- heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe. In the Tantrasamgraha (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and Copernican models, but did not propose any specific models of the universe.K. Ramasubramanian, et al. (1994), p. 788 Nilakantha's planetary system also incorporated the Earth's rotation on its axis. Most astronomers of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics seem to have accepted his planetary model. Renaissance-era astronomy =European astronomy before Copernicus= Some historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory, in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple, influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by Copernicus.A. I. Sabra (1998). Copernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources. Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus. Copernicus' lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al-Shatir's. (PDF version) Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) wrote \\"Il sole non si move.\\" (\\"The Sun does not move.\\") The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in Georg von Peuerbach's Theoricae Novae Planetarum (printed in 1472 by Regiomontanus). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212. While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the Maragha school, postulated by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957, remains an open question.N.K. Singh, M. Zaki Kirmani,Encyclopaedia of Islamic science and scientistsViktor Bl√•sj√∂, \\"A Critique of the Arguments for Maragha Influence on Copernicus\\", Journal for the History of Astronomy, 45 (2014), 183‚Äì195 ADS. Since the Tusi couple was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy, there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way. It has been suggestedClaudia Kren, \\"The Rolling Device,\\" p. 497.George Saliba, \\"Whose Science is Arabic Science in Renaissance Europe?\\" that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science, which translated some of al-Tusi's works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi couple are still extant in Italy. Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.Goddu (2010, pp. 261‚Äì69, 476‚Äì86), Huff (2010, pp. 263‚Äì64), di Bono (1995), Veselovsky (1973). Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the \\"Islamic Golden Age\\" (10th to 12th centuries) in De Revolutionibus: Albategnius (Al-Battani), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra), Arzachel (Al-Zarqali), and Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school. It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus's Commentary on the First Book of Euclid, which Copernicus cited. Another possible source for Copernicus's knowledge of this mathematical device is the Questiones de Spera of Nicole Oresme, who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi. =Copernican heliocentrism= Portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus (1578) Nicolaus Copernicus in his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (\\"On the revolution of heavenly spheres\\", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his Almagest. Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets. In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus's system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system. This theory resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than real: it was a parallax effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric Tychonic system; the latter, however, while eliminating the major epicycles, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a \\"pretzel\\".Gingerich, (2004, p. 51) Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of De Revolutionibus (which still survives), stating: \\"Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion.\\"Gingerich, O. \\"Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?\\" Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.16, NO.1/FEB, P. 37, 1985. Philolaus had the Earth moving around a Central Fire which was not the Sun, so Copernicus's reference to Aristarchus's model as possibly geodynamic does not necessarily imply that he thought it was heliocentric. However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by Cicero he had found an account of the theories of Hicetas and that Plutarch had provided him with an account of the Pythagoreans, Heraclides Ponticus, Philolaus, and Ecphantus. These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun Reception in Early Modern Europe =Circulation of Commentariolus (published before 1515)= The first information about the heliocentric views of Nicolaus Copernicus was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514.A library catalogue of a 16th-century historian, Matthew of Miechow, bears that date and contains a reference to the manuscript, so it must have begun circulating before that date (Koyr√©, 1973, p.85; Gingerich, 2004, p.32). Although only in manuscript, Copernicus' ideas were well known among astronomers and others. His ideas contradicted the then-prevailing understanding of the Bible. In the King James Bible (first published in 1611), First Chronicles 16:30 states that \\"the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.\\" Psalm 104:5 says, \\"[the Lord] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.\\" Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that \\"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.\\" Nonetheless, in 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals.Speller (2008, p.51) On November 1, 1536, Archbishop of Capua Nikolaus von Sch√∂nberg wrote a letter to Copernicus from Rome encouraging him to publish a full version of his theory. However, in 1539, Martin Luther said: This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. Melanchthon, however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.Melanchthon, Elements of Physics, 1st. edition, 1549Revolution in Science, I. Bernard Cohen, page 497. =Publication of De Revolutionibus (1543)= Nicolaus Copernicus published the definitive statement of his system in De Revolutionibus in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to Pope Paul III, the published form contained an unsigned preface by Osiander defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be heretical during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among Dominicans that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time. Some years after the publication of De Revolutionibus John Calvin preached a sermon in which he denounced those who \\"pervert the order of nature\\" by saying that \\"the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns\\".Rosen (1995, p.159). Rosen disputes the earlier conclusion of another scholar that this was referring specifically to Copernicus's theory. According to Rosen, Calvin had very likely never heard of Copernicus and was referring instead to \\"the traditional geokinetic cosmology\\". =Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)= In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars, located just beyond Saturn. Prior to the publication of De Revolutionibus, the most widely accepted system had been proposed by Ptolemy, in which the Earth was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. Tycho Brahe, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus's heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: a geo-heliocentric system now known as the Tychonic system in which the five then known planets orbit the Sun, while the Sun and the Moon orbit the Earth. Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The Aristotelian physics of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called aether that moved naturally. So Tycho said that the Copernican system \\"... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.\\"Owen Gingerich, The eye of heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, New York: American Institute of Physics, 1993, 181, Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, \\"Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.\\"Blair, Ann, \\"Tycho Brahe's critique of Copernicus and the Copernican system\\", Journal of the History of Ideas, 51, 1990, 364. He also cited the Copernican system's \\"opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place\\" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative \\"offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture\\".Gingerich, O. & Voelkel, J. R., J. Hist. Astron., Vol. 29, 1998, page 1, 24 The Jesuit astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, Clavius, commented that Tycho was \\"confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have Mars lower than the Sun.\\"Fantoli, 2003, p. 109 However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the Sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century. Giordano Bruno (d. 1600) is the only known person to defend Copernicus's heliocentrism in his time. Using measurements made at Tycho's observatory, Johannes Kepler developed his laws of planetary motion between 1609 and 1619. In Astronomia nova (1609), Kepler made a diagram of the movement of Mars in relation to Earth if Earth were at the center of its orbit, which shows that Mars' orbit would be completely imperfect and never follow along the same path. To solve the apparent derivation of Mars' orbit from a perfect circle, Kepler derived both a mathematical definition and, independently, a matching ellipse around the Sun to explain the motion of the red planet. Between 1617 and 1621, Kepler developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae, in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted, and Galileo for example ignored them. In 1621, Epitome astronomia Copernicanae was placed on the Catholic Church's index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant. =Galileo Galilei and 1616 ban against Copernicanism= In the 17th century AD, Galileo Galilei opposed the Roman Catholic Church by his strong support for heliocentrism. Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his discoveries that Jupiter is orbited by moons and that the Sun rotates in his Sidereus Nuncius (1610) and Letters on Sunspots (1613), respectively. Around this time, he also announced that Venus exhibits a full range of phases (satisfying an argument that had been made against Copernicus). As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved away from the Ptolemaic model and toward Tycho's teachings.Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 433) In his 1615 \\"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\\", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took Augustine's position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the Sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the Sun in motion across the sky. In February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccol√≤ Lorini brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the Council of Trent.Langford (1992), p.56-57Drake (1978, p.240), Sharratt (1994, pp.110‚Äì111), Favaro (1907, 19:297‚Äì298) . Cardinal and Inquisitor Robert Bellarmine was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be \\"a very dangerous thing,\\" irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming \\"the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false.\\"Sharratt (1994, pp.110‚Äì115) In January 1616, Msgr. Francesco Ingoli addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February.Graney (2015, pp. 68‚Äì69) Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015. According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the \\"chief direct basis\\" for the ban.Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72) The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory \\"clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.\\"Graney (2015, pp. 71) Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.Graney (2015, pp. 66‚Äì76, 164‚Äì175, 187‚Äì195) In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as \\"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\\" The Inquisition also determined that the Earth's motion \\"receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith.\\"Favaro (1907, 19:320) , Dom√≠nguez (2014); arXiv:1402.6168 Original text of the decision Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo In March 1616, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal Master of the Sacred Palace, Congregation of the Index, and the Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called \\"the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.\\" In 1618, the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' De Revolutionibus be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758. Pope Urban VIII encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that, > I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the > Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are > indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...The Systeme of > the World: in Four Dialogues (1661) Thomas Salusbury translation of Dialogo > sopra i Due Massi Sistemi del Mondo (1632) and his straightforward statement, > I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre > in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, > whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; > yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a > terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre... Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character Simplicio. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome.Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 491) Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between \\"teaching\\" and \\"holding and defending as true\\". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life. According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's \\"appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance.\\"Heilbron (1999, p.203) In 1664, Pope Alexander VII published his Index Librorum Prohibitorum Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, P.M.) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.\\"The Pontifical Decrees Against the Doctrine of the Earth's Movement, and the Ultramontane Defence of Them\\", Rev. William Roberts, 1885, London =Age of Reason= Ren√© Descartes' first cosmological treatise, written between 1629 and 1633 and titled The World, included a heliocentric model, but Descartes abandoned it in the light of Galileo's treatment.Weintraub, David A. Is Pluto a Planet, p. 66, Princeton University Press, 2007 In his Principles of Philosophy (1644), Descartes introduced a mechanical model in which planets do not move relative to their immediate atmosphere, but are constituted around space-matter vortices in curved space; these rotate due to centrifugal force and the resulting centripetal pressure. The Galileo affair did little overall to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's Epitome of Copernican Astronomy became increasingly influential in the coming decades.\\"Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion: 1609‚Äì1666\\", J. L. Russell, British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 2, No. 1, June 1964 By 1686, the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, published in France by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and translated into English and other languages in the coming years. It has been called \\"one of the first great popularizations of science.\\" In 1687, Isaac Newton published Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of universal gravitation and what came to be known as Newton's laws of motion. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the \\"deviation of the Sun\\" from the center of gravity of the Solar System.Curtis Wilson, \\"The Newtonian achievement in astronomy\\", pages 233‚Äì274 in R Taton & C Wilson (eds) (1989), The General History of Astronomy, Volume 2A, at page 233 For Newton it was not precisely the center of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but \\"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\\", and this center of gravity \\"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\\". Newton adopted the \\"at rest\\" alternative in view of common consent that the center, wherever it was, was at rest.(text quotations from 1729 translation of Newton Principia, Book 3 (1729 vol.2) at pages 232‚Äì233). Meanwhile, the Catholic Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called meridiane; i.e., they were turned into \\"reverse sundials\\", or gigantic pinhole cameras, where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line. A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (1766) by Joseph Wright, in which a lamp represents the Sun In the mid-eighteenth century the Catholic Church's opposition began to fade. An annotated copy of Newton's Principia was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the Index of Forbidden Books.John L.Heilbron, Censorship of Astronomy in Italy after Galileo (in McMullin, Ernan ed., The Church and Galileo, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 2005, p. 307, IN. ) The Observatory of the Roman College was established by Pope Clement XIV in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by Pope Leo XIII as the Vatican Observatory in 1891). In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's De Revolutionibus or Galileo's Dialogue. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Catholic Church's chief censor), Filippo Anfossi, refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.Heilbron (2005, pp.279, 312‚Äì313) Settele appealed to pope Pius VII. After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned. Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. Copernicus's De Revolutionibus and Galileo's Dialogue were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the Index when it appeared in 1835. Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by James Bradley, in 1838 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, and in 1851 by L√©on Foucault. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the Earth. Bessel proved that the parallax of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of a star named 61 Cygni. In the same year Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson measured the parallaxes of other stars, Vega and Alpha Centauri. Experiments like those of Foucault were performed by V. Viviani in 1661 in Florence and by Bartolini in 1833 in Rimini. Reception in Judaism Already in the Talmud, Greek philosophy and science under general name \\"Greek wisdom\\" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods. The first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name, was Maharal of Prague, his book \\"Be'er ha-Golah\\" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of radical skepticism, arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.Noah J. Efron. Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe. Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1997), pp. 719‚Äì732 Copernicus is mentioned in the books of David Gans (1541‚Äì1613), who worked with Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one \\"Magen David\\" (1612) and a full one \\"Nehmad veNaim\\" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: Ptolemy, Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe without taking sides. Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591‚Äì1655) in his \\"Elim\\" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them.Sefer Elim, Amsterdam, 1629, —Å—Ç—Ä. 304 Delmedigo studied at Padua and was acquainted with Galileo.Neher (1977). An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period accept Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from David Nieto and Tobias Cohn. Both of these authors argued against heliocentrism on grounds of contradictions to scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus \\"a first-born of Satan\\", though he also acknowledgedIn a marginal note in his Mass√© Touvia (part 2, p.52b): \\"Remark of the author: I fear that the incredulous may draw an objection from a text of Midrash Bereshit Rabba (V,8) in which our Teachers, the Rabbis, of blessed memory, explain that if the Earth is called in Hebrew \\"eretz\\" it is because it hastens (\\"ratseta\\") before the Creator in order to accomplish His will. I acknowledge that the answer to this objection seems difficult for me to find\\", as translated by Neher (1977, p.220). that he would have found it difficult to counter one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud. In the 19th century two students of the Hatam sofer wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. The one, a commentary on Genesis Yafe‚Äôah le-Ketz written by R. Israel David Schlesinger resisted a heliocentric model and supported geocentrism. The other, Mei Menuchot written by R. Eliezer Lipmann Neusatz encouraged acceptance of the heliocentric model and other modern scientific thinking. Since the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include Shlomo Benizri and R. M.M. Schneerson of Chabad who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the relativity of motion.\\"on the basis of the presently accepted scientific view (in accordance with the theory of Relativity) that where two bodies in space are in motion relative to one another, it is impossible scientifically to ascertain which revolves around which, or which is stationary and the other in motion. Therefore, to say that there is, or can be, 'scientific proof' that the earth revolves around the sun is quite an unscientific and uncritical statement.\\" Schneerson's followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model. Modern science Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the status of the Sun as merely one star among many became increasingly obvious. By the 20th century, even before the discovery that there are many galaxies, it was no longer an issue. The concept of an absolute velocity, including being \\"at rest\\" as a particular case, is ruled out by the principle of relativity, also eliminating any obvious \\"center\\" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Even if the discussion is limited to the Solar System, the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one focus of the elliptical orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the Solar System is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun. (The masses of the planets, mostly Jupiter, amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.) Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an extrasolar planet would observe a small \\"wobble\\" in the Sun's motion. =Modern use of geocentric and heliocentric= In modern calculations, the terms \\"geocentric\\" and \\"heliocentric\\" are often used to refer to reference frames.Shen, J. & Confrey, J. (2010). Justifying alternative models in learning the solar system: A case study on K-8 science teachers‚Äô understanding of frames of reference. International Journal of Science Education, 32 (1), 1-29. In such systems the origin in the center of mass of the Earth, of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire Solar System, can be selected.See center-of- mass frame Right ascension and declination are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations. This leads to such terms as \\"heliocentric velocity\\" and \\"heliocentric angular momentum\\". In this heliocentric picture, any planet of the Solar System can be used as a source of mechanical energy because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller body (either artificial or natural) may gain heliocentric velocity due to gravity assist ‚Äì this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of \\"geocentric\\" or \\"heliocentric\\" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific model. From the point of view of general relativity, inertial reference frames do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision. Some forms of Mach's principle consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.

Taylor is a recreational user of nitrous oxide, justifying his choice of drug by the eponymous Sangamon's principle: \\"the simpler the molecule, the better the drug\\". In the novel, Taylor is a chemist working for GEE, a fictional environmental activism group which stages both protests and direct actions plugging toxic waste pipes. Taylor becomes involved with Basco Industries, a fictional corporation which produced Agent Orange and is a major supplier of organic chlorine compounds. Basco experiments with genetic engineering to develop chemical producing microbes, driving Taylor's efforts to expose their crimes and preserve Boston Harbor. A number of the later events of the novel take place on Boston Harbor's Spectacle Island which at the time of publication was almost entirely composed of garbage. In the story it is frequented by drugged- out and reputedly Satanic groupies of the \\"two-umlaut\\" heavy metal music band, P√∂yzen B√∂yzen, who are too intoxicated with angel dust to realize they are poisoning themselves with the toxic waste that was dumped there. Taylor's projects involve sampling the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls in Boston Harbor with the help of the Gallaghers, a fishing family who record the location of the lobsters they catch. While gathering evidence which GEE will use to expose Basco's crimes, Taylor is flummoxed by the fact that the toxins have suddenly disappeared. He eventually discovers that Basco has acquired a bioengineering firm, where his high school nemesis is employed as a genetic engineer, to create a bacterium that is able to digest toxins, cleaning up the harbor instantly. However, Basco had been forced to release the bacteria into the wild without full testing because of their imminent exposure by GEE. Depending on the equilibrium state of the harbor, the new bacteria are also able to create toxins. To stop Taylor meddling with their plans, Basco discredits him by planting a bomb in his house and framing him as a terrorist trying to assassinate their president. He escapes with the help of a Native American tribe and eventually returns in secret to steal one of their ships containing a large amount of toxins which they are planning to release into the ocean.

A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy. Types Generally, locks are advisory locks, where each thread cooperates by acquiring the lock before accessing the corresponding data. Some systems also implement mandatory locks, where attempting unauthorized access to a locked resource will force an exception in the entity attempting to make the access. The simplest type of lock is a binary semaphore. It provides exclusive access to the locked data. Other schemes also provide shared access for reading data. Other widely implemented access modes are exclusive, intend-to-exclude and intend-to- upgrade. Another way to classify locks is by what happens when the lock strategy prevents progress of a thread. Most locking designs block the execution of the thread requesting the lock until it is allowed to access the locked resource. With a spinlock, the thread simply waits (\\"spins\\") until the lock becomes available. This is efficient if threads are blocked for a short time, because it avoids the overhead of operating system process re- scheduling. It is inefficient if the lock is held for a long time, or if the progress of the thread that is holding the lock depends on preemption of the locked thread. Locks typically require hardware support for efficient implementation. This support usually takes the form of one or more atomic instructions such as \\"test-and-set\\", \\"fetch-and-add\\" or \\"compare-and-swap\\". These instructions allow a single process to test if the lock is free, and if free, acquire the lock in a single atomic operation. Uniprocessor architectures have the option of using uninterruptable sequences of instructions‚Äîusing special instructions or instruction prefixes to disable interrupts temporarily‚Äîbut this technique does not work for multiprocessor shared-memory machines. Proper support for locks in a multiprocessor environment can require quite complex hardware or software support, with substantial synchronization issues. The reason an atomic operation is required is because of concurrency, where more than one task executes the same logic. For example, consider the following C code: if (lock  0) { // lock free, set it lock = myPID; } The above example does not guarantee that the task has the lock, since more than one task can be testing the lock at the same time. Since both tasks will detect that the lock is free, both tasks will attempt to set the lock, not knowing that the other task is also setting the lock. Dekker's or Peterson's algorithm are possible substitutes if atomic locking operations are not available. Careless use of locks can result in deadlock or livelock. A number of strategies can be used to avoid or recover from deadlocks or livelocks, both at design-time and at run-time. (The most common strategy is to standardize the lock acquisition sequences so that combinations of inter-dependent locks are always acquired in a specifically defined \\"cascade\\" order.) Some languages do support locks syntactically. An example in C# follows: public class Account // This is a monitor of an account { private decimal _balance = 0; private object _balanceLock = new object(); public void Deposit(decimal amount) { // Only one thread at a time may execute this statement. lock (_balanceLock) { _balance += amount; } } public void Withdraw(decimal amount) { // Only one thread at a time may execute this statement. lock (_balanceLock) { _balance -= amount; } } } The code \`lock(this)\` can lead to problems if the instance can be accessed publicly. Similar to Java, C# can also synchronize entire methods, by using the MethodImplOptionsSynchronized attribute. [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)] public void SomeMethod() { // do stuff } Granularity Before being introduced to lock granularity, one needs to understand three concepts about locks: * lock overhead: the extra resources for using locks, like the memory space allocated for locks, the CPU time to initialize and destroy locks, and the time for acquiring or releasing locks. The more locks a program uses, the more overhead associated with the usage; * lock contention: this occurs whenever one process or thread attempts to acquire a lock held by another process or thread. The more fine-grained the available locks, the less likely one process/thread will request a lock held by the other. (For example, locking a row rather than the entire table, or locking a cell rather than the entire row.); * deadlock: the situation when each of at least two tasks is waiting for a lock that the other task holds. Unless something is done, the two tasks will wait forever. There is a tradeoff between decreasing lock overhead and decreasing lock contention when choosing the number of locks in synchronization. An important property of a lock is its granularity. The granularity is a measure of the amount of data the lock is protecting. In general, choosing a coarse granularity (a small number of locks, each protecting a large segment of data) results in less lock overhead when a single process is accessing the protected data, but worse performance when multiple processes are running concurrently. This is because of increased lock contention. The more coarse the lock, the higher the likelihood that the lock will stop an unrelated process from proceeding. Conversely, using a fine granularity (a larger number of locks, each protecting a fairly small amount of data) increases the overhead of the locks themselves but reduces lock contention. Granular locking where each process must hold multiple locks from a common set of locks can create subtle lock dependencies. This subtlety can increase the chance that a programmer will unknowingly introduce a deadlock. In a database management system, for example, a lock could protect, in order of decreasing granularity, part of a field, a field, a record, a data page, or an entire table. Coarse granularity, such as using table locks, tends to give the best performance for a single user, whereas fine granularity, such as record locks, tends to give the best performance for multiple users. Database locks Database locks can be used as a means of ensuring transaction synchronicity. i.e. when making transaction processing concurrent (interleaving transactions), using 2-phased locks ensures that the concurrent execution of the transaction turns out equivalent to some serial ordering of the transaction. However, deadlocks become an unfortunate side-effect of locking in databases. Deadlocks are either prevented by pre-determining the locking order between transactions or are detected using waits-for graphs. An alternate to locking for database synchronicity while avoiding deadlocks involves the use of totally ordered global timestamps. There are mechanisms employed to manage the actions of multiple concurrent users on a database‚Äîthe purpose is to prevent lost updates and dirty reads. The two types of locking are pessimistic locking and optimistic locking: * Pessimistic locking: a user who reads a record with the intention of updating it places an exclusive lock on the record to prevent other users from manipulating it. This means no one else can manipulate that record until the user releases the lock. The downside is that users can be locked out for a very long time, thereby slowing the overall system response and causing frustration. :: Where to use pessimistic locking: this is mainly used in environments where data-contention (the degree of users request to the database system at any one time) is heavy; where the cost of protecting data through locks is less than the cost of rolling back transactions, if concurrency conflicts occur. Pessimistic concurrency is best implemented when lock times will be short, as in programmatic processing of records. Pessimistic concurrency requires a persistent connection to the database and is not a scalable option when users are interacting with data, because records might be locked for relatively large periods of time. It is not appropriate for use in Web application development. * Optimistic locking: this allows multiple concurrent users access to the database whilst the system keeps a copy of the initial-read made by each user. When a user wants to update a record, the application determines whether another user has changed the record since it was last read. The application does this by comparing the initial-read held in memory to the database record to verify any changes made to the record. Any discrepancies between the initial-read and the database record violates concurrency rules and hence causes the system to disregard any update request. An error message is generated and the user is asked to start the update process again. It improves database performance by reducing the amount of locking required, thereby reducing the load on the database server. It works efficiently with tables that require limited updates since no users are locked out. However, some updates may fail. The downside is constant update failures due to high volumes of update requests from multiple concurrent users - it can be frustrating for users. :: Where to use optimistic locking: this is appropriate in environments where there is low contention for data, or where read-only access to data is required. Optimistic concurrency is used extensively in .NET to address the needs of mobile and disconnected applications, where locking data rows for prolonged periods of time would be infeasible. Also, maintaining record locks requires a persistent connection to the database server, which is not possible in disconnected applications. Disadvantages Lock-based resource protection and thread/process synchronization have many disadvantages: * Contention: some threads/processes have to wait until a lock (or a whole set of locks) is released. If one of the threads holding a lock dies, stalls, blocks, or enters an infinite loop, other threads waiting for the lock may wait forever. * Overhead: the use of locks adds overhead for each access to a resource, even when the chances for collision are very rare. (However, any chance for such collisions is a race condition.) * Debugging: bugs associated with locks are time dependent and can be very subtle and extremely hard to replicate, such as deadlocks. * Instability: the optimal balance between lock overhead and lock contention can be unique to the problem domain (application) and sensitive to design, implementation, and even low-level system architectural changes. These balances may change over the life cycle of an application and may entail tremendous changes to update (re-balance). * Composability: locks are only composable (e.g., managing multiple concurrent locks in order to atomically delete item X from table A and insert X into table B) with relatively elaborate (overhead) software support and perfect adherence by applications programming to rigorous conventions. * Priority inversion: a low-priority thread/process holding a common lock can prevent high-priority threads/processes from proceeding. Priority inheritance can be used to reduce priority-inversion duration. The priority ceiling protocol can be used on uniprocessor systems to minimize the worst-case priority-inversion duration, as well as prevent deadlock. * Convoying: all other threads have to wait if a thread holding a lock is descheduled due to a time-slice interrupt or page fault. Some concurrency control strategies avoid some or all of these problems. For example, a funnel or serializing tokens can avoid the biggest problem: deadlocks. Alternatives to locking include non-blocking synchronization methods, like lock-free programming techniques and transactional memory. However, such alternative methods often require that the actual lock mechanisms be implemented at a more fundamental level of the operating software. Therefore, they may only relieve the application level from the details of implementing locks, with the problems listed above still needing to be dealt with beneath the application. In most cases, proper locking depends on the CPU providing a method of atomic instruction stream synchronization (for example, the addition or deletion of an item into a pipeline requires that all contemporaneous operations needing to add or delete other items in the pipe be suspended during the manipulation of the memory content required to add or delete the specific item). Therefore, an application can often be more robust when it recognizes the burdens it places upon an operating system and is capable of graciously recognizing the reporting of impossible demands. =Lack of composability= One of lock-based programming's biggest problems is that \\"locks don't compose\\": it is hard to combine small, correct lock-based modules into equally correct larger programs without modifying the modules or at least knowing about their internals. Simon Peyton Jones (an advocate of software transactional memory) gives the following example of a banking application: design a class that allows multiple concurrent clients to deposit or withdraw money to an account; and give an algorithm to transfer money from one account to another. The lock- based solution to the first part of the problem is: class Account: member balance : Integer member mutex : Lock method deposit(n : Integer) mutex.lock() balance ‚Üê balance + n mutex.unlock() method withdraw(n : Integer) deposit(‚àín) The second part of the problem is much more complicated. A routine that is correct for sequential programs would be function transfer(from : Account, to : Account, amount : integer) from.withdraw(amount) to.deposit(amount) In a concurrent program, this algorithm is incorrect because when one thread is halfway through , another might observe a state where has been withdrawn from the first account, but not yet deposited into the other account: money has gone missing from the system. This problem can only be fixed completely by taking locks on both account prior to changing any of the two accounts, but then the locks have to be taken according to some arbitrary, global ordering to prevent deadlock: function transfer(from : Account, to : Account, amount : integer) if from < to // arbitrary ordering on the locks from.lock() to.lock() else to.lock() from.lock() from.withdraw(amount) to.deposit(amount) from.unlock() to.unlock() This solution gets more complicated when more locks are involved, and the function needs to know about all of the locks, so they cannot be hidden. Language support Programming languages vary in their support for synchronization: * The ISO/IEC C standard provides a standard mutual exclusion (locks) API since C11. The current ISO/IEC C++ standard supports threading facilities since C++11. The OpenMP standard is supported by some compilers, and allows critical sections to be specified using pragmas. The POSIX pthread API provides lock support. Visual C++ provides the \`synchronize\` attribute of methods to be synchronized, but this is specific to COM objects in the Windows architecture and Visual C++ compiler. C and C++ can easily access any native operating system locking features. * Objective-C provides the keyword \`@synchronized\` to put locks on blocks of code and also provides the classes NSLock, NSRecursiveLock, and NSConditionLock along with the NSLocking protocol for locking as well. * C# provides the \`lock\` keyword on a thread to ensure its exclusive access to a resource. * VB.NET provides a \`SyncLock\` keyword like C#'s \`lock\` keyword. * Java provides the keyword \`synchronized\` to lock code blocks, methods or objects and libraries featuring concurrency-safe data structures. * Python provides a low-level mutex mechanism with a \`Lock\` class from the \`threading\` module. * The ISO/IEC Fortran standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) provides the \`lock_type\` derived type in the intrinsic module \`iso_fortran_env\` and the \`lock\`/\`unlock\` statements since Fortran 2008. * Ruby provides a low-level mutex object and no keyword. * Ada provides protected objects that have visible protected subprograms or entries as well as rendezvous. * x86 assembly provides the \`LOCK\` prefix on certain operations to guarantee their atomicity. * PHP provides a file-based locking as well as a \`Mutex\` class in the \`pthreads\` extension.

It is located on Longtou Mountain, southeast of Toudao Town () in Helong, Jilin Province, China, a region possibly called the \\"Western Field of the Ran Valley\\" () by the Balhae people. The mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo is located here. History Construction on the first tombs at Longtou Mountain began sometime after 745, when King Mun moved the Balhae capital city to Junggyeong. The cemetery was in use until the end of the Balhae Kingdom. The discovery of Princess Jeonghyo's tombstone resolved speculation amongst scholars that the area was the former location of Hyundeok Province (ÌòÑÎçïÎ∂Ä È°ØÂæ∑Â∫ú) of the Balhae Kingdom. The site has been a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level since January 13, 1988. The walls and the murals of the tomb have been covered with anti-corrosive chemicals; at one point the tomb included at least one tower, but it is no longer standing.  Excavation  The first excavations at Longtou Mountain were conducted in 1980 by the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Museum of Jilin (). They excavated the Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo in the Dragon Sea section. At the same time, members of the museum, in addition to other organisations, conducted a survey of a 7.5 km2 area. Local archaeologists were also invited to conduct test excavations on some of the other tombs, which produced various precious artefacts. In 1982, the Yanbian Museum excavated seven tombs in the Dragon Sea area. All seven were clustered quite close together, but the tomb roofs had already collapsed. Some tombs cut through older tombs. Two of these tombs contained two people, who had been interred at the same time; four tombs contained two people, who had been interred one after the other; one tomb contained four people, one of whom was first interred, followed by the other three on a separate occasion. In the cases of a secondary burial, the second person was placed on top of the first body's head or feet. Layout There are three burial zones: * Dragon Lake () * Dragon Sea () ** The location of Princess Jeonghyo's mausoleum ** One robbed- out tumulus to the south-east. The inner north, east, and west walls were plastered, but the tomb had collapsed by 2012. ** 10 burials distributed over terraces to the east of Princess Jeonghyo's burial * Stone Kingdom () Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo The princess' tombThe Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo (Chinese: Zhƒìnxi√†o G≈çngzh«î m√π Ë¥ûÂ≠ùÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ¢ì, hangul: Ï†ïÌö®Í≥µÏ£ºÎ¨ò) was made in 793 by the people of the early Balhae kingdom.Lee Injae, Owen Miller, Park Jinhoon, Yi Hyun-hae, „ÄäKorean History in Maps„Äã, Cambridge University Press, 2014. p.65 The mausoleum contains, among other things, the first complete discovered and detailed murals done by Balhae artists, and hence provides valuable insights to historians. The mausoleum originally had a funerary pagoda made from brick and stone slabs, in addition to a tumulus. Only the pagoda's foundations remain, which show that it was originally square, measuring 5.50x5.65 m.Korea Art History Academy, \\"ÁæéË°ìÂè≤Â≠∏Á°èÁ©∂\\", 233-236, 2002. p.59 Below the funerary pagoda and tumulus, the princess' burial comprised an entry passage, tomb entrance, internal passage, and burial chamber. The burial chamber is underground, and was excavated in October 1980.Keong-il Kim, \\"Pioneers of Korean Studies\\", Joeun Munhwasa, 2004. p.459 The burial chamber measured 2.10x3.10 m and was built from bricks, with stone slabs forming the roof. The mounds of earth lined with stones demonstrate the continuance of Goguryeo-style tomb but the formal clothing shows Tang style, which implies that Balhae actively accepted the Tang culture.Patricia Ebrey, Anne Walthall, \\"Pre-Modern East Asia:A Cultural, Social and Political History\\", Cengage Learning, 2013. p.65 There were originally 12 murals depicting people on the rear walls of the internal passage and north, east, and west walls of the burial chamber. The chamber is surrounded by four murals on each wall, depicting thirteen people in action, such as warriors (3), chamber attendants, musicians, and maids, wearing red, blue, yellow, purple, and brown robes. The murals displayed the image of the Balhae people in its completeness for the first time. The burial chamber contains a 1.05-metre tall, 0.58-metre width √ó 0.26-m depth mugui-shaped () complete and unbroken granite epitaph, on which 728 Chinese characters, in the Regular Script style, are inscribed in 18 horizontal lines. The epitaph is of a typical combined written form, which contained both the chronological writings of the Princess' whole life and the remembrance writings which displayed the praise and remembrance for the Princess. The Balhae scholar author of this epitaph was highly learned in the traditional Chinese literature, as reflected in the use of poetic lines modeled upon poets of the early Tang dynasty. =Interments= The epitaph explains that Princess Jeonghyo (Ï†ïÌö®Í≥µÏ£º, Ë≤ûÂ≠ùÂÖ¨‰∏ª) is the fourth daughter of King Mun, the third ruler of Balhae. Princess Jeonghyo was also the younger sister of Princess Jeonghye (Ï†ïÌòúÍ≥µÏ£º, Ë≤ûÊÉ†ÂÖ¨‰∏ª). The epitaph shows that Balhae considered its ruler as an emperor equivalent to that of China.Korea Herald, \\"Korea Now\\", Vol.33 1-13, 2004. 32 The epitaph also recorded that the Princess died on Monday, 6 July 792, during the fifty-sixth year of the Daeheung era.Northeast History Foundation, \\"Journal of Northeast Asian History\\" Vol.4, 1-2, p.92 She was accompanied in the burial at Ran Valley () in Xi Yuan (Ë•øÂéü or Western Plains) in the winter of 809 () (western Gregorian solar calendar Monday, 11 January 810, Chinese lunar calendar 28th day of the 11th month). She was given the posthumous name \\"Jeonghyo\\" to qualify her as virtuous and filial. She was likely a horse-rider, as the remains of a horse were found in the chamber. The epitaph recorded the year of death as 792. This corrected previous works such as Jin Yufu's () Book of the Balhae Kingdom (), which recorded 793 instead. The skeletal remains were scattered all over the chamber when discovered by archaeologists, due to previous looting. However, the looters missed several golden and copper items, jewelry, pottery, and figurines. The gold ornament depicting a three stranded bird's wing is a piece of evidence demonstrating how Balhae was inherited of Goguryeo's crowns.Find Challenges China's Claim to Balhae Kingdom The Chosun Ilbo, 2009-08-27, Retrieved in 2015-06-28 Reconstruction showed that the bones belong to a woman, presumably the princess; but there is also a male, possibly an attendant or child.

Since the thread remains active but is not performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of busy waiting. Once acquired, spinlocks will usually be held until they are explicitly released, although in some implementations they may be automatically released if the thread being waited on (the one which holds the lock) blocks, or \\"goes to sleep\\". Because they avoid overhead from operating system process rescheduling or context switching, spinlocks are efficient if threads are likely to be blocked for only short periods. For this reason, operating-system kernels often use spinlocks. However, spinlocks become wasteful if held for longer durations, as they may prevent other threads from running and require rescheduling. The longer a thread holds a lock, the greater the risk that the thread will be interrupted by the OS scheduler while holding the lock. If this happens, other threads will be left \\"spinning\\" (repeatedly trying to acquire the lock), while the thread holding the lock is not making progress towards releasing it. The result is an indefinite postponement until the thread holding the lock can finish and release it. This is especially true on a single-processor system, where each waiting thread of the same priority is likely to waste its quantum (allocated time where a thread can run) spinning until the thread that holds the lock is finally finished. Implementing spin locks correctly offers challenges because programmers must take into account the possibility of simultaneous access to the lock, which could cause race conditions. Generally, such an implementation is possible only with special assembly-language instructions, such as atomic test-and-set operations and cannot be easily implemented in programming languages not supporting truly atomic operations. On architectures without such operations, or if high-level language implementation is required, a non-atomic locking algorithm may be used, e.g. Peterson's algorithm. However, such an implementation may require more memory than a spinlock, be slower to allow progress after unlocking, and may not be implementable in a high-level language if out-of-order execution is allowed. Example implementation The following example uses x86 assembly language to implement a spinlock. It will work on any Intel 80386 compatible processor. ; Intel syntax locked: ; The lock variable. 1 = locked, 0 = unlocked. dd 0 spin_lock: mov eax, 1 ; Set the EAX register to 1. xchg eax, [locked] ; Atomically swap the EAX register with ; the lock variable. ; This will always store 1 to the lock, leaving ; the previous value in the EAX register. test eax, eax ; Test EAX with itself. Among other things, this will ; set the processor's Zero Flag if EAX is 0. ; If EAX is 0, then the lock was unlocked and ; we just locked it. ; Otherwise, EAX is 1 and we didn't acquire the lock. jnz spin_lock ; Jump back to the MOV instruction if the Zero Flag is ; not set; the lock was previously locked, and so ; we need to spin until it becomes unlocked. ret ; The lock has been acquired, return to the calling ; function. spin_unlock: xor eax, eax ; Set the EAX register to 0. xchg eax, [locked] ; Atomically swap the EAX register with ; the lock variable. ret ; The lock has been released. Significant optimizations The simple implementation above works on all CPUs using the x86 architecture. However, a number of performance optimizations are possible: On later implementations of the x86 architecture, spin_unlock can safely use an unlocked MOV instead of the slower locked XCHG. This is due to subtle memory ordering rules which support this, even though MOV is not a full memory barrier. However, some processors (some Cyrix processors, some revisions of the Intel Pentium Pro (due to bugs), and earlier Pentium and i486 SMP systems) will do the wrong thing and data protected by the lock could be corrupted. On most non-x86 architectures, explicit memory barrier or atomic instructions (as in the example) must be used. On some systems, such as IA-64, there are special \\"unlock\\" instructions which provide the needed memory ordering. To reduce inter-CPU bus traffic, code trying to acquire a lock should loop reading without trying to write anything until it reads a changed value. Because of MESI caching protocols, this causes the cache line for the lock to become \\"Shared\\"; then there is remarkably no bus traffic while a CPU waits for the lock. This optimization is effective on all CPU architectures that have a cache per CPU, because MESI is so widespread. On Hyper-Threading CPUs, pausing with \`rep nop\` gives additional performance by hinting the core that it can work on the other thread while the lock spins waiting. Transactional Synchronization Extensions and other hardware transactional memory instruction sets serve to replace locks in most cases. Although locks are still required as a fallback, they have the potential to greatly improve performance by having the processor handle entire blocks of atomic operations. This feature is built into some mutex implementations, for example in glibc. The Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) in x86 is a weakened but backwards-compatible version of TSE, and we can use it here for locking without losing any compatibility. In this particular case, the processor can choose to not lock until two threads actually conflict with each other. A simpler version of the test can use the \`cmpxchg\` instruction on x86, or the \`__sync_bool_compare_and_swap\` built into many Unix compilers. With the optimizations applied, a sample would look like: ; In C: while(!__sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&locked;, 0, 1)) while(locked) __builtin_ia32_pause(); spin_lock: mov ecx, 1 ; Set the ECX register to 1. retry: xor eax, eax ; Zero out EAX, because cmpxchg compares against EAX. XACQUIRE lock cmpxchg ecx, [locked] ; atomically decide: if locked is zero, write ECX to it. ; XACQUIRE hints to the processor that we are acquiring a lock. je out ; If we locked it (old value equal to EAX: 0), return. pause: mov eax, [locked] ; Read locked into EAX. test eax, eax ; Perform the zero-test as before. jz retry ; If it's zero, we can retry. rep nop ; Tell the CPU that we are waiting in a spinloop, so it can ; work on the other thread now. Also written as the \\"pause\\". jmp pause ; Keep check-pausing. out: ret ; All done. spin_unlock: XRELEASE mov [locked], 0 ; Assuming the memory ordering rules apply, release the ; lock variable with a \\"lock release\\" hint. ret ; The lock has been released. Alternatives The primary disadvantage of a spinlock is that, while waiting to acquire a lock, it wastes time that might be productively spent elsewhere. There are two ways to avoid this: # Do not acquire the lock. In many situations it is possible to design data structures that do not require locking, e.g. by using per-thread or per-CPU data and disabling interrupts. # Switch to a different thread while waiting. This typically involves attaching the current thread to a queue of threads waiting for the lock, followed by switching to another thread that is ready to do some useful work. This scheme also has the advantage that it guarantees that resource starvation does not occur as long as all threads eventually relinquish locks they acquire and scheduling decisions can be made about which thread should progress first. Spinlocks that never entail switching, usable by real-time operating systems, are sometimes called raw spinlocks. Most operating systems (including Solaris, Mac OS X and FreeBSD) use a hybrid approach called \\"adaptive mutex\\". The idea is to use a spinlock when trying to access a resource locked by a currently-running thread, but to sleep if the thread is not currently running. (The latter is always the case on single- processor systems.) OpenBSD attempted to replace spinlocks with ticket locks which enforced first-in-first-out behaviour, however this resulted in more CPU usage in the kernel and larger applications, such as Firefox, becoming much slower.

The first ballpoint pen had been invented roughly 50 years earlier by John J. Loud, but it did not attain commercial success. Early life B√≠r√≥ was born to a Hungarian Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, in 1899 to M√≥zes M√°ty√°s Schweiger and Janka n√©e Ullmann. After leaving school, he began work as a journalist in Hungary. Invention of the ballpoint pen While working as a journalist B√≠r√≥ noticed that the ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge-free. He tried using the same ink in a fountain pen, but found that it would not flow into the tip, as it was too viscous. B√≠r√≥'s invention Birome B√≠r√≥ presented the first production of the ballpoint pen at the Budapest International Fair in 1931. Working with his brother Gy√∂rgy, a chemist, he developed a new tip consisting of a ball that was free to turn in a socket, and as it turned it would pick up ink from a cartridge and then roll to deposit it on the paper. B√≠r√≥ patented the invention in Paris in 1938. During World War II, B√≠r√≥ fled the Nazis with his brother, moving to Argentina, in 1943. On 17 June 1943, they filed another patent, issued in the US as , and formed Biro Pens of Argentina (in Argentina the ballpoint pen is known as birome). This new design was supposedly licensed for production in the United Kingdom for supply to Royal Air Force aircrew. Birome's advertising in Argentine magazine Leopl√°n, 1945 In 1945, Marcel Bich bought the patent from B√≠r√≥ for the pen, which soon became the main product of his BIC company. Bic has sold more than 100 billion ballpoint pens worldwide. In November of that same year, promoter Milton Reynolds introduced a gravity- fed pen to the U.S. market, to try to get around Biro's patent, which was based on capillary action, where fresh ink is drawn out of the reservoir of the pen as ink is deposited on the paper. Because the Reynolds workaround depended on a gravity feed, it did not infringe, but required thinner ink and a larger barrel.Rosenberg, Robert Leonard (1971).

The Reynolds Pen was successful for a few years, until its reputation for leaking and competition from established pen manufacturers overtook it. Death and legacy L√°szl√≥ B√≠r√≥ died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1985. Argentina's Inventors' Day is celebrated on B√≠r√≥'s birthday, 29 September. A ballpoint pen is widely referred to as a \\"biro\\" in many countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia and Italy. Although the word is a registered trademark, in some countries it has become genericised.

After participating in several occult rituals, \\"Jay\\" believes he is being haunted by a demon named Raul. The book is based on \\"true\\" events of 16-year-old Alden Barrett from Pleasant Grove, Utah, who committed suicide in 1971. Some critics have challenged the authenticity of the story, noting that the editor of this book, Beatrice Sparks, has filled the same role on many other \\"actual, anonymous diaries of teenagers\\" that explore such sensational themes as drug addiction, teenage pregnancy, and prostitution. These books, the most well- known of which is Go Ask Alice, serve as cautionary tales. According to a book written by Barrett's brother Scott (A Place in the Sun: The Truth Behind Jay's Journal) and interviews with the family, Sparks used roughly 25 entries of 212 total from Barrett's actual journal. The other entries were fictional, with Sparks claiming they were based on case histories from other teenagers Sparks worked with and interviews of friends and acquaintances of Barrett. A rock opera titled A Place in the Sun was created and performed by Utah county band Grain in 1997. According to some family members, it was a more accurate portrayal and showed Sparks' alleged exploitation of the story. Within the city of Pleasant Grove, Jay's Journal has been the source of many urban legends, including alleged locations where Jay performed actions described in the book, his home, the effect on his family after his death, and other rumors. Due to allegations of ritual cattle mutilation arising in Jay's Journal, the book came to the attention of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers investigating reports of killed and mutilated cows in Alberta.

R√©aumur and Celsius scale on thermometer. Private collection, central Europe. The R√©aumur scale (; ¬∞R√©, ¬∞Re, ¬∞r), also known as the \\"octogesimal division\\",Division octogesimale in French. is a temperature scale for which the freezing and boiling points of water are defined as 0 and 80 degrees respectively. The scale is named for Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur, who first proposed a similar scale in 1730.  Change in scale  R√©aumur‚Äôs thermometer contained diluted alcohol (ethanol) and was constructed on the principle of using 0¬∞ for the freezing temperature of water, and graduating the tube into degrees, each of which was one-thousandth of the volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark. He suggested that the concentration of alcohol employed be such that it began boiling at 80 ¬∞R√© ‚Äî that is, when it had expanded in volume by 8%. He chose alcohol instead of mercury because it expands more visibly, but this posed problems: his original thermometers were very bulky, and the low boiling point of alcohol made them unsuitable for many applications. Instrument-makers generally chose different liquids, and then used 80 ¬∞R√© to signify the boiling point of water, causing much confusion. During 1772 Jean-Andr√© Deluc studied the several substances then used in thermometers and concluded that mercurial thermometers were the best for practical use; for example, if two equal amounts of water at x and y degrees were mixed, the temperature of the result was then the average of x and y degrees, and this relationship was only reliable when mercury was used. From the late 18th century mercury was used almost without exception.Herbert Dingle. The scientific adventure: essays in the history and philosophy of science.

By the 1790s, France had chosen the Celsius scale as part of the metric system, rather than the R√©aumur measurement, but it was used commonly in some parts of Europe until at least the mid-19th century, and in parts of Russia until the early 20th. Its main modern uses are in some Italian and Swiss factories for measuring milk temperature during cheese production,Reaumur thermometer for Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese) and in the Netherlands for measuring temperature when cooking sugar syrup for desserts and sweets.
