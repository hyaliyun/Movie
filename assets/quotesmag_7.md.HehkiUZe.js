The mountain is the pre-eminent symbol of the Slovene nation. It is the centrepiece of Triglav National Park, Slovenia's only national park. Triglav was also the highest peak in Yugoslavia before Slovenia's independence in 1991. Name Various names have been used for the mountain through history. An old map from 1567 named it Ocra mons, whereas Johann Weikhard von Valvasor named it Krma in the second half of the 17th century. According to the German mountaineer and professor Adolf Gstirner, the name Triglav first appeared in written sources as Terglau in 1452, but the original source has been lost. The next known occurrence of Terglau is cited by Gstirner and is from a court description of the border in 1573. Early forms of the name Triglav also include Terglau in 1612, Terglou in 1664 and Terklou around 1778‚Äì89. The name is derived from the compound *Tri-golv—ä (literally 'three-head'‚Äîthat is, 'three peaks'), which may be understood literally because the mountain has three peaks when viewed from much of Upper Carniola. It is unlikely that the name has any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav. In the local dialect, the name is pronounced T…ôrgw√≤ (with a second-syllable accent) in contrast to standard Slovene Tr√≠glav.Bezlaj, France. 2005. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskega jezika, vol. 4. Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti, p. 224. The highest peak is sometimes also called Big Mount Triglav () to distinguish it from Little Mount Triglav (, ) immediately to the east. History The first recorded ascent of Triglav was achieved in 1778, at the initiative of the industrialist and polymath Sigmund Zois. According to the most commonly cited report, published in the newspaper Illyrisches Blatt in 1821 by the historian and geographer Johann Richter, these were the surgeon Lovrenz Willomitzer (written as Willonitzer by Richter), the chamois hunter ≈†tefan Ro≈æiƒç, and the miners Luka Koro≈°ec and Matev≈æ Kos. According to a report by Belsazar Hacquet in his Oryctographia Carniolica, this happened towards the end of 1778, by two chamois hunters, one of them being Luka Koro≈°ec, and one of his former students, whose name is not mentioned. Triglav's height was first measured on 23 September 1808 by Valentin Staniƒç. The first to put the name of the mountain on a map, written as Mons Terglou, was Joannes Disma Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld, who in 1744 published the map Ducatus Carniolae Tabula Chorographica. The first map its name appeared on written as Triglav was Zemljovid Slovenske de≈æele in pokrajin (Map of Slovene Lands and Provinces) by Peter Kosler, completed from 1848 until 1852 and published in Vienna in 1861. During World War II, Triglav symbolically captured the primary drive by the Slovene resistance to the Fascist and Nazi armies. The Slovene Partisans wore the Triglav cap from 1942 until after 1944. Triglav was the highest peak of the now defunct Yugoslavia; it was both countries highest and most prominent peak and, together with the southern Vardar River (now in North Macedonia), was the symbol of Yugoslavian \\"brotherhood and unity\\". Landmarks Alja≈æ Tower Alja≈æ Tower at the top of the mountain At the top of the mountain stands a small metal structure, the Alja≈æ Tower (). It acts as a storm shelter and a triangulation point. Along with Triglav, it is also a landmark of Slovenia and a symbol of the Slovenes and Slovene territorial sovereignty. The tower's namesake was the priest, mountaineer and patriot Jakob Alja≈æ. In early 1895, he drew up, with a piece of chalk on the floor of his room in the parish of Dovje, plans for a cylindrical tower with a flag on its top. In April that year he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one Austro-Hungarian gulden. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on the mountain top. The tower was constructed from iron and zinc coated sheet steel by Anton Belec from ≈†ent Vid nad Ljubljano. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. The opening took place that same day. Alja≈æ donated the shelter to the Slovene Alpine Society. In the beginning, there were three four-legged chairs, a summit register, a spirit stove, and the image Triglav Panorama by Marko Pernhart in the tower. It was later repainted and renovated several times by Alojz Knafelc and others. In the Communist era, as the highest point of the former Yugoslavia, it was painted red and decorated with a red star. However, it has now more or less been restored to its original appearance. The star was removed shortly before the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the proclamation of Slovene independence in June 1991, the flag of Slovenia was raised on top of the tower. Staniƒç Shelter In 1895, due to a lack of space, Alja≈æ also commissioned the building of the Staniƒç Shelter. It is located below the top of Triglav and is named after the poet and mountaineer Valentin Staniƒç. The shelter has dimensions of and has room for 8 people sitting or 16 standing. Originally it also had a wooden door, benches, a table, and a chair. Its significance diminished after the Kredarica Lodge was erected in 1896. Triglav Glacier Remains of the Triglav Glacier in 2002 The Triglav Glacier () was located below the summit on the karstified Triglav Plateaus (), part of the northeastern side of the mountain. Covering over at the end of the 19th century, the glacier had shrunk to by 1946, and after further shrinkage had fallen into two parts by 1992. By 2011 it covered an area of only 1‚Äì3 hectares, depending on the season. It was no longer considered a glacier in 2019. Cultural significance Folk literature The Triglav area is the setting of an old Slovene folk tale concerning a hunter seeking a treasure guarded by an enchanted chamois buck named Zlatorog (Goldhorn, after its golden horns). Arts Romantic view of Triglav by the Carinthian Slovene painter Marko Pernhart The earliest known depiction of Triglav is on the front page of the work Oryctographia Carniolica, written by Belsazar Hacquet. It was a copper engraving made in 1778 by C. Conti after a drawing by Franz Xaver Baraga. Among later visual artists who depicted Triglav, the most well known are Anton Karinger (1829‚Äì1870) from Ljubljana, Marko Pernhart (1824‚Äì1871) from Klagenfurt, Valentin Hodnik (1896‚Äì1935) from Stara Fu≈æina, Edo Der≈æaj (1904‚Äì1980) from Ljubljana, and more recently Marjan Zaletel (born 1945), living in Ljubljana. Among the musical works related to Triglav, a special place is held for the poem Oh, Triglav, My Home (). It was written in 1894 by the priest and poet Matija Zemljiƒç and quickly became very popular among Slovene mountaineers. In 2007, its first stanza, accompanied by a melody of Jakob Alja≈æ, became the official anthem of the Alpine Association of Slovenia. An instrumental version of the poem, written by Bojan Adamiƒç, is part of the start and end credits of the annual ski jumping broadcasts from Planica. The first Slovene-language full-length film, recorded in 1931 by Janko Ravnik, was titled In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn () and features an ascent by a group of students to the top of Triglav. The second Slovene full- length film, recorded the following year, was titled The Slopes of Mount Triglav (). It was directed by Ferdo Delak and was a romantic story featuring a wedding on the top of Triglav. Since 1968, Triglav has become a theme of avant-garde artists. The first instance was a manifestation by the art group OHO, called Mount Triglav, which took place in December 1968 at Ljubljana's Congress Square. In 2004, the group IRWIN produced a series of paintings named Like to Like/ Mount Triglav. In 2007, an artistic performance was held atop Mount Triglav by the artists Janez Jan≈°a (director), Janez Jan≈°a (visual artist) and Janez Jan≈°a (performance artist) called Mount Triglav on Mount Triglav. National symbol Coat of arms of Slovenia, with a stylized depiction of Triglav A Slovene Partisan triglavka A stylized depiction of Triglav's distinctive shape is the central element of the Slovene coat of arms, designed by the sculptor Marko Pogaƒçnik, and is in turn featured on the flag of Slovenia. Alongside San Marino and Slovakia, Slovenia is the only other country in Europe and one of the few in the world to feature a mountain on its coat-of-arms. Formerly, it was featured on the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. The first to depict Triglav as the symbol of the Slovenes was the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, who in 1934 put it besides other coats-of-arms of the nations of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on the coat of the statue of the Mother of God in front of the parish church in Bled. During World War II, the stylised Triglav was the symbol of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation resistance movement. The distinctive three-pronged caps worn by Slovene Partisans during World War II were known as triglavkas. A relief map of the mountain is the design on the national side of the Slovene 50 eurocent coin. The former Slovene president Milan Kuƒçan once proclaimed that it is a duty of every Slovenian person to climb Triglav at least once in their lifetime.

A regional currency is a form of local currency encompassing a larger geographical area. A local currency acts as a complementary currency to a national currency, rather than replacing it, and aims to encourage spending within a local community, especially with locally owned businesses. Such currencies may not be backed by a national government nor be legal tender. About 300 complementary currencies, including local currencies, are listed in the Complementary Currency Resource Center worldwide database. Terminology Some definitions: * Complementary currency - is used as a complement to a national currency, as a medium of exchange, which is usually not legal tender. * Community currency - a complementary currency used by a group with a common bond, such as residents of a locality, association, or members of a business or online community. * Local currency - a complementary currency used in a locality. * Regional currency - a local currency where the locality is a larger region. * Auxiliary currency, microcurrency, Eco-Money - less common synonyms for community or local currency. (see for example Douthwaite & Wagman 1999) * Private currency - a currency issued by an individual, business or non-governmental organization. Complementary currencies are a type of private currency. * Sectoral currency - a complementary currency used within one economic sector, such as education or health care. * Alternative currency - generally, a synonym for complementary currency, referring to a currency designed to work in conjunction with the national currency; less often refers to a type of private currency which attempts to supplant or circumvent the national currency. Benefits The W√∂rgl experiment illustrates some of the common characteristics and major benefits of local currencies.Lietaer, Bernard, The Future of Money, Century, 2002. 1\\\\. Local currencies with negative interest rate or demurrage tend to circulate much more rapidly than national currencies. The same amount of currency in circulation is employed more times and results in far greater overall economic activity. It produces greater benefit per unit. The higher velocity of money is a result of the negative interest rate which encourages people to spend the money more quickly. 2\\\\. Local currencies enable the community to more fully use its existing productive resources, especially unemployed labor, which has a catalytic effect on the rest of the local economy. They are based on the premise that the community is not fully using its productive capacities, because of a lack of local purchasing power. The alternative currency is used to increase demand, resulting in a greater exploitation of productive resources. So long as the local economy is functioning at less than full capacity, the introduction of local currency need not be inflationary, even when it results in a significant increase in total money supply and total economic activity. 3\\\\. Since local currencies are only accepted within the community, their usage encourages the purchase of locally produced and locally-available goods and services. Thus, for any level of economic activity, more of the benefit accrues to the local community and less drains out to other parts of the country or the world. For instance, construction work undertaken with local currencies employs local labor and uses as far as possible local materials. The enhanced local effect becomes an incentive for the local population to accept and use the scrips. 4\\\\. Some forms of complementary currency can promote fuller use of resources over a much wider geographic area and help bridge the barriers imposed by distance. The Fureai kippu system in Japan issues credits in exchange for assistance to senior citizens. Family members living far from their parents can earn credits by offering assistance to the elderly in their local community. The credits can then be transferred to their parents and redeemed by them for local assistance. Airline frequent flyer miles are a form of complementary currency that promotes customer-loyalty in exchange for free travel. The airlines offer most of the coupons for seats on less heavily sold flights where some seats normally go empty, thus providing a benefit to customers at relatively low cost to the airline. 5\\\\. While most of these currencies are restricted to a small geographic area or a country, through the Internet electronic forms of complementary currency can be used to stimulate transactions on a global basis. In China, Tencent's QQ coins are a virtual form of currency that has gained wide circulation. QQ coins can be bought for Renminbi and used to buy virtual products and services such as ringtones and on-line video game time. They can also be obtained through on- line exchange for goods and services at about twice the Renminbi price, by which additional 'money' is being directly created. Though virtual currencies are not 'local' in the tradition sense, they do cater to the specific needs of a particular community, a virtual community. Once in circulation, they add to the total effective purchasing power of the on-line population as in the case of local currencies. The Chinese government has begun to tax the coins as they are exchanged from virtual currency to actual hard currency.China Taxes Online Game Players KerryOnWorld, December 7, 2008 Difficulties and criticisms Local currencies and the Transition Towns movement in the UK have been criticized for failing to address the needs of the wider population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticized as having limited success in stimulating spending in local economies, and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions.The Undercover Economist on Local Currency  Modern local currencies  Modern local currencies can be classified into the following distinct types: 1\\\\. Transition currency based on the local currencies used by the Transition Towns movement in the UK. They include Brixton Pound and Bristol Pound in the UK, BerkShares in the USA, and Salt Spring Dollars in Canada. Salt Spring Dollars are a community currency issued by the Salt Spring Island Monetary Foundation. The currency is used by both tourists and local residents of Salt Spring Island. Transition currencies are payment voucher- based systems that are exchangeable with the national currency. Between 2002-2014 many experiments in local currency took this form. Such currencies aim to raise the resilience of local economies by encouraging re-localisation of buying and food production. The drive for this change has arisen from a range of community-based initiatives and social movements. The Transition Towns movement originating in the UK has used local currencies for re- localisation in the face of energy descent from peak oil and climate change. Other drives include movements against Clone townClone Town Britain survey: results reveals national identity crisis The new economics foundation, 6 June 2005 and Big-box trends. 2\\\\. Rewards currency based on the frequent flyer model. Consumer spends cash with participating businesses who issue rewards points in a local currency. These rewards points can be used to offset cash prices in future purchases. An example is Oakland Grown in Oakland, CA. 3\\\\. Mutual Credit currency based on the mutual credit system. This can be further sub-divided into two: a. Time-based currency also known as Time Banks that use time as a measure of value. An example is Dane County Time Bank. b. Trade exchanges and LETS (local exchange trading system) that use price as a measure of value. An example of local currency implemented as a trade exchange is Bay Bucks in the Bay Area of California, USA. LETS were originally started in Vancouver, Canada, there are presently more than 30 LETS systems operating in Canada and over 400 in the United Kingdom. Australia, France, New Zealand, and Switzerland have similar systems.

This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce). The meaning of the word \\"trust\\" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, malicious or execute tasks that are undesired by the user. Trusted system can also be seen as level base security system where protection is provided and handled according to different levels. This is commonly found in military, where information is categorized as unclassified(U), confidential(C), Secret(S), Top secret(TS) and beyond. These also enforces the policies of No-read up and No-write down. Trusted systems in classified information A subset of trusted systems (\\"Division B\\" and \\"Division A\\") implement mandatory access control (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing classified information. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's \\"Yellow Book\\" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration. Central to the concept of U.S. Department of Defense- style \\"trusted systems\\" is the notion of a \\"reference monitor\\", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper- proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. National Security Agency's 1983 Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or \\"Orange Book\\", a set of \\"evaluation classes\\" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system. Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not size, as often cited) of the trusted computing base (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy. An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted. Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of \\"correctness\\" with that of \\"trustworthiness\\". In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes--the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards--the more recently introduced Common Criteria (CC)--which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various NATO countries--provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven \\"evaluation classes\\" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the \\"target of evaluation\\" (TOE) and support--even encourage --an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined \\"protection profiles.\\" While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a \\"chain of evidence\\" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning. The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of classified information derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the Bell-LaPadula model, in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of objects (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and subjects (active entities--perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users--that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a \\"history\\" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows. At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with \\"lattice- based information flows\\" in computer systems. (A mathematical \\"lattice\\" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either \\"dominates,\\" \\"is dominated by,\\" or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of \\"labels\\"--corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, e.g., TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO--that are attached to entities. Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report--entitled, Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation--whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the \\"simple security property\\" (a subject can only read from an object that it dominates [is greater than is a close enough--albeit mathematically imprecise-- interpretation]) and the \\"confinement property,\\" or \\"*-property\\" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as \\"no-read-up\\" and \\"no-write-down,\\" respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow \\"downhill\\" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain Trojan horses, one of the most general classes of attack (sciz., the popularly reported worms and viruses are specializations of the Trojan horse concept). The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces \\"confidentiality,\\" or \\"secrecy,\\" controls, i.e., they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of \\"integrity\\"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects) and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, K. J. Biba. Other integrity models include the Clark-Wilson model and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, \\"The SeaView Model\\"Lunt, Teresa & Denning, Dorothy & R. Schell, Roger & Heckman, Mark & R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. (Source) An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed discretionary access controls(DACs), are under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as permission bits (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and--in a more flexible and powerful form--by Multics since earlier still) and access control lists (ACLs) are familiar examples of DACs. The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model--which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints--that takes the form of a finite state machine (FSM) with state criteria, state transition constraints, a set of \\"operations\\" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a descriptive top-level specification (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible interface (e.g., an API, a set of system calls [in UNIX parlance] or system exits [in mainframe parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations. Trusted systems in trusted computing The Trusted Computing Group creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information. Trusted systems in policy analysis Trusted systems in the context of national or homeland security, law enforcement, or social control policy are systems in which some conditional prediction about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence, Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005). For example, trusted systems include the use of \\"security envelopes\\" in national security and counterterrorism applications, \\"trusted computing\\" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of credit or identity scoring systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or risk analysis is used to assess \\"trust\\" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems constraints to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which deviation analysis or systems surveillance is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters. The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of criminal justice based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur ‚Äì see Cesare Beccaria, On Crimes and Punishment (1764) ‚Äì to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative surveillance and control through system constraints ‚Äì see Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (1975, Alan Sheridan, tr., 1977, 1995). In this emergent model, \\"security\\" is geared not towards policing but to risk management through surveillance, exchange of information, auditing, communication, and classification. These developments have led to general concerns about individual privacy and civil liberty and to a broader philosophical debate about the appropriate forms of social governance methodologies. Trusted systems in information theory Trusted systems in the context of information theory is based on the definition of trust as 'Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel' by Ed Gerck.Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) Trust Points, in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, ; Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information In Information Theory, information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect‚Äîas measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be. Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts. Trust is not taken in the purely subjective sense either, nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological‚Äîtrust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I, The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, . Taken together in the model of Information Theory, information is what you do not expect and trust is what you know. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as qualified reliance on received information. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.Gregory, John D. (1997). John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication? The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.Huemer, L. (1998). Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction? Ume√•: Bor√©a. . It also leads to conceptions of information where the \\"quality\\" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.Ivanov, K. (1972). Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems.The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology. An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in. The IBM Federal Software Group Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's ISSAA ). has suggested that provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service- oriented architecture vision.

It is part of the GNU Project. GNUstep features a cross-platform, object-oriented IDE. Apart from the default Objective-C interface, GNUstep also has bindings for Java, Ruby, GNU Guile and Scheme.GScheme The GNUstep developers track some additions to Apple's Cocoa to remain compatible. The roots of the GNUstep application interface are the same as the roots of Cocoa: NeXTSTEP and OpenStep. GNUstep thus predates Cocoa, which emerged when Apple acquired NeXT's technology and incorporated it into the development of the original Mac OS X, while GNUstep was initially an effort by GNU developers to replicate the technically ambitious NeXTSTEP's programmer-friendly features.  History  GNUstep began when Paul Kunz and others at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center wanted to port HippoDraw from NeXTSTEP to another platform. Instead of rewriting HippoDraw from scratch and reusing only the application design, they decided to rewrite the NeXTSTEP object layer on which the application depended. This was the first version of libobjcX. It enabled them to port HippoDraw to Unix systems running the X Window System without changing a single line of their application source. After the OpenStep specification was released to the public in 1994, they decided to write a new objcX which would adhere to the new APIs. The software would become known as \\"GNUstep\\".  Software architecture Illustrates software components of the Linux desktop stack like the display server, graphics control element libraries or graphical shells.  Rendering  GNUstep contains a set of graphical control elements written in the Objective-C programming language. The graphical user interface (GUI) of GNUMail is composed of graphics control elements. GNUMail has to interact with the windowing system, e.g. X11 or Wayland, and its graphical user interface has to be rendered. GNUstep's backend provides a small set of functions used by the user interface library to interface to the actual windowing system. It also has a rendering engine which emulates common Postscript functions. The package gnustep-back provides the following backends: * cairo ‚Äì default backend using the Cairo 2D graphics library. * winlib ‚Äì default backend on Microsoft Windows systems. Cairo and Windows API variants. * art ‚Äì old (deprecated) backend on unix-like systems. Uses the vector-based PostScriptlike 2d graphics library Libart. * xlib ‚Äì old (deprecated) X11 backend.

It is very incomplete. * The CoreBase library is designed to be compatible with Core Foundation. It is not complete enough to for the Base (Foundation Kit) component to simply be a wrapper around it. * The QuartzCore library implements Core Animation APIs. The Opal library implements Quartz 2D. , there are no projects that builds the Swift programming language against the GNUstep Objective-C environment.

Trubar introduced The Reformation in Slovenia, leading the Austrian Habsburgs to wage the Counter-Reformation, which a small Protestant community survived. Trubar is a key figure of Slovenian history and in many aspects a major historical personality. Life and work Trubar was born in the village of Ra≈°icahttp://www.dlib.si/v2/Preview.aspx?URN=URN:NBN:SI:DOC-EL7XWPP2 (now in the Municipality of Velike La≈°ƒçe) in the Duchy of Carniola, then under the Habsburgs. In the years 1520‚Äì1521 he attended school in Rijeka, in 1522‚Äì1524 he continued his education in Salzburg. From there he went to Trieste under the tutorship of the Roman Catholic bishop Pietro Bonomo, where he got in touch with the Humanist writers, in particular Erasmus of Rotterdam. In 1527 the bishop Pietro Bonomo assigned Trubar a priest position in Loka pri Zidanem Mostu. In 1528 he enrolled at the University of Vienna, but did not complete his studies. In 1530 he returned to the Slovenian Lands and became a preacher in Ljubljana, where he lived up until 1565. While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today's Fish Square (Ribji trg), in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had profound impact on his work, he considered Ljubljana the capital of all Slovenes because of its central position in the heart of the Slovene lands and because its residents spoke Slovene as their first language, unlike several other towns in today's Slovenia. It is estimated that in Trubar's period around 70% of Ljubljana's 4000 inhabitants attended mass in Slovene. It was the language of Ljubljana that Trubar took as a foundation of what later became standard Slovene, with small addition of his native speech, that is Lower Carniolan dialect. Trubar considered Ljubljana's speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble, than his own, simple dialect of his hometown Ra≈°ica. His decision to write in Ljubljana's variety was later adopted also by other Protestant writers, who also lived in Ljubljana during Trubar's time. He gradually leaned towards Protestantism and was expelled from Ljubljana in 1547. In 1550, while a Protestant preacher in Rothenburg, he wrote the first two books in Slovene, Catechismus and Abecedarium, which were then printed that year in Schw√§bisch Hall by Peter Frentz. Catechismus also contained the first Slovene musical manuscript in print. Altogether, Trubar authored 22 books in Slovene and two books in German. He was the first to translate parts of the Bible into Slovene. After the exhortation by Pier Paolo Vergerio, he translated the Gospel of Matthew in 1555 and until 1577 in three parts published the translation of the entire New Testament. In period between 1561 and 1565 Trubar was the manager and supervisor of the South Slavic Bible Institute. Trubar died in Derendingen, Holy Roman Empire (now part of the city of T√ºbingen, Germany), where he is also buried. Commemoration The monument to Primo≈æ Trubar by . White marble, 1910. The statue stands in Trubar Park opposite the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana. On June 4, 1952, the street ≈†entpeterska cesta in Ljubljana was renamed Trubarjeva cesta after Trubar. It is one of the oldest roads in the city, first mentioned in 1802, and starts in Pre≈°ernov trg (Pre≈°eren Square), named after Slovenia's national poet. The street is currently known for its high concentration of ethnic restaurants. In 1986, Slovene television produced a TV series, directed by Andrej Strojan with the screenplay written by Drago Janƒçar, in which Trubar was played by the Slovene actor Polde Bibiƒç. Trubar was commemorated on the 10 tolar banknotehttp://www.bsi.si/en/description-banknotes-and-coins.asp?MapaId=528 in 1992, and on the Slovene 1 euro coin in 2007. In 2008, the Government of Slovenia proclaimed the Year of Primo≈æ Trubar and the 500th anniversary of Trubar's birth was celebrated throughout the country. A commemorative ‚Ç¨2 coin and a postage stamp were issued. An exhibition dedicated to the life and work of Primo≈æ Trubar, and the achievements of the Slovene Reformation Movement was on display at the National Museum of Slovenia from 6 March to 31 December 2008. In 2009, the Trubar Forum Association printed Trubar's Catechism and Abecedarium in modern Slovene, in a scholarly edition that includes both the Trubar-era Slovene and the modern Slovene translation with scholarly notes. The \\"Sermon on Faith\\", a portion of the Catechism, is available in modern Slovene, English, German and Esperanto. Since 2010, 8 June is commemorated in Slovenia as Primo≈æ Trubar Day. Google celebrated his 505th birthday anniversary with a dedicated Google Doodle.

He rose to fame as the original lead singer of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, he launched a successful solo career with \\"Solsbury Hill\\" as his first single. His 1986 album, So, is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's most successful single, \\"Sledgehammer\\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and, according to a report in 2011, it was MTV's most played music video of all time. Gabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co- founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \\"Biko\\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the Witness human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007. Gabriel has won three Brit Awards‚Äîwinning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \\"influence on generations of music makers\\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \\"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014. In March 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of his achievements in music.  Early life  Peter Brian Gabriel was born on 13 February 1950 in Chobham, Surrey. He was raised in a middle- class family in Coxhill, a Victorian manor situated on Deep Pool Farm just outside Chobham. His father, Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912‚Äì2012), was an electrical engineer and his mother, Edith Irene Gabriel (n√©e Allen), was from a musical family. His great-great-great-uncle, Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet, was Lord Mayor of London from 1866 to 1877. Gabriel attended Cable House, a private primary school in Woking, Surrey, followed by St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in Horsell, Surrey. During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom. Gabriel remarked of his early influences, \\"Hymns played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to soul music before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back.\\"Capital Radio interview with Alan Freeman, broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine White Shadow (#3, pp12) by editor Fred Tomsett At age 12, Gabriel wrote his first song, \\"Sammy the Slug\\". Around this time, an aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons, but he used it to buy the Beatles' first album Please Please Me. In September 1963, he started at Charterhouse, a public school in Godalming, Surrey. There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band: the trad jazz outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word. In 1965, Gabriel formed Garden Wall with school friends Tony Banks on piano and Chris Stewart on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel; the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At a final concert before they split, Gabriel, dressed in a kaftan and beads, showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens.  Career   1967‚Äì1975: Genesis  In 1967, after Garden Wall had disbanded, Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart were invited by fellow pupils Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford to work on a demo tape of songs. Gabriel and Banks contributed \\"She is Beautiful\\", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to former Charterhouse pupil turned musician Jonathan King, who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested a band name of Gabriel's Angels, but it was unpopular with the other members. They settled on King's other suggestion, Genesis. After King suggested they stick towards more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote \\"The Silent Sun\\" as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis's first single, released in 1968. It was included on their first studio album, From Genesis to Revelation (1968), which saw Gabriel play the flute. After the commercial failure of From Genesis to Revelation, the band went their separate ways and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse. In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time working band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on Mona Bone Jakon (1970) by Cat Stevens. The second Genesis album, Trespass (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporate his soul music influences. He wrote the lyrics to \\"The Knife\\" as a parody of a protest song. The album sold little and at one point, Gabriel secured a place at London School of Film Technique because Genesis \\"seemed to be dying.\\" Genesis recruited guitarist Steve Hackett after Gabriel spotted his advert in the Melody Maker. Their next album, Nursery Cryme (1971), features Gabriel playing the oboe. Its opener, \\"The Musical Box\\", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics. The Moonlit Knight\\", 1974 Gabriel performing during The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour, 1975 The shows supporting Foxtrot (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. He had started to recite stories to introduce numbers as a way to cover the silence between songs, while the band tuned their instruments, or while technical faults were being fixed. During a gig in Dublin in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of \\"The Musical Box\\" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. He kept the idea to himself as he felt the band would have voted against it. Despite some initial doubts from his bandmates, the incident received front-page coverage in Melody Maker, giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, Genesis Live (1973). By late 1973, following the success of Selling England by the Pound (1973), which centred around English themes and literary references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make- up, a cape, and bat wings for \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\", various costumes for \\"Supper's Ready\\", and an old man mask for \\"The Musical Box\\". The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) was Gabriel's final album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and the bizarre incidents and characters he meets on the way. Tensions increased during this period as Gabriel wanted to write all of the lyrics himself, and split with the band after director William Friedkin had invited him to work on a screenplay. The project dissolved, and Gabriel returned to work with Genesis. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. In the end, Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. In the liner notes, Gabriel is credited with \\"experiments with foreign sounds\\". He had Brian Eno provide additional electronic effects. During a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary which irritated the rest of the band. The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled \\"Out, Angels Out\\", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family. The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him. His exit resulted in drummer Phil Collins reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.  1975‚Äì1985: Solo debut with Peter Gabriel albums  Gabriel described his break from music as his \\"learning period\\", during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975; the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall. After preparing material for an album Gabriel recorded his solo debut, Peter Gabriel in 1976 and 1977 in Toronto and London, with producer Bob Ezrin. Gabriel did not title his first four albums. All were labelled Peter Gabriel, using the same typeface, with designs by Hipgnosis. \\"The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year,\\" he remarked in 1978. \\"So it's the same title, the same lettering in the same place; only the photo is different.\\"Best magazine, May 1978; translated in Gabriel fanzine White Shadow (#1, pp13) by editor Fred Tomsett Each album has, however, been given a nickname by fans, usually relating to the album cover. For many years, Gabriel was managed by Gail Colson. Peter Gabriel (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 1: Car) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, \\"Solsbury Hill\\", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of Solsbury Hill in Somerset. \\"It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get ...\\" said Gabriel. \\"It's about letting go.\\" Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist Robert Fripp often playing off stage and introduced as \\"Dusty Rhodes\\". Gabriel on stage in 1978 In late 1977, Gabriel started recording the second Peter Gabriel album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch) in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its \\"Mother of Violence\\" was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads. Gabriel recorded the third Peter Gabriel album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt) in England in 1979. He had developed an interest in African music and drum machines and later hailed the record as his breakthrough. The album has been credited as the first to use gated reverb on the drums, creating a distinct sound. While recording drums on \\"Intruder\\", one of the tracks featuring Phil Collins, Gabriel had Collins play various rhythms without using cymbals for several minutes which he used to develop the song further. Collins used the gated effect on his debut solo single \\"In the Air Tonight\\" which became a signature sound in the 1980s and beyond. Atlantic Records ‚Äì Gabriel's US distributor, which had released his first two albums ‚Äì refused to put it out. \\"An American A&R; person came over in the middle of recording and ‚Äì other than attempting to make one track sound like the Doobie Brothers, which he failed considerably to do ‚Äì he was convinced that the thing was much too [adopts American accent] 'esoteric, Peter'‚Ä¶ He wasn't convinced then that they would want to do anything with it. And, sure enough, when it was sent over there, it was given the big elbow.\\"Capital Radio interview with Nicky Horne, broadcast 16 March 1980; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine White Shadow (#1, pp8) by editor Fred Tomsett Gabriel signed with Mercury Records. Released in May 1980, the album went to No. 1 in the UK for three weeks. In the US, it peaked at No. 22. The singles \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" went to No. 4 and \\"Biko\\" went to No. 36 in the UK. After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel's first instance of crowd surfing when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows. Gabriel performing in 1980 On Peter Gabriel four (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 4: Security), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, Ashcombe House, in Somerset. Gabriel performs a Fairlight CMI computer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. \\"Over the course of the last two albums,\\" he observed, \\"I've got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writing ‚Äì particularly with the invention of these drum machines ‚Äì is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you're doing.\\" The fourth Peter Gabriel, released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, \\"Shock the Monkey\\", became Gabriel's first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with Geffen Records, which ‚Äì initially unbeknown to Gabriel ‚Äì titled the album Security to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel's 1982 tour lasted for one year and became his first to make a profit. Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel's debut live release, Plays Live (1983). Gabriel produced versions of the third and fourth Peter Gabriel albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered. In 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for Alan Parker's film Birdy (1984). This consisted of new material as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album. 1985‚Äì1997: So, Passion, and Us After finishing the soundtrack to Birdy, Gabriel shifted his musical focus from rhythm and texture, as heard on Peter Gabriel four and Birdy, towards more straightforward songs. In 1985, he recorded his fifth studio album, So, which he co-produced with Daniel Lanois. So was released in May 1986 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. It remains Gabriel's best selling album with over 5 million copies sold in the US alone.\\"British album certifications ‚Äì Peter Gabriel ‚Äì So\\" . British Phonographic Industry.

Retrieved 21 November 2011 Gabriel performing in 1986. \\"Sledgehammer\\" was particularly successful, dealing with sex and sexual relations through lyrical innuendos. Its famed music video was a collaboration between director Stephen R. Johnson, Aardman Animations, and the Brothers Quay and won a record nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987. In 1998, it was named MTV's number one animated video of all time. So earned Gabriel two wins at the 1987 Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video (for \\"Sledgehammer\\"). He was nominated for four Grammy Awards: Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year for \\"Sledgehammer\\", and Album of the Year for So. Gabriel toured worldwide to support So with the This Way Up Tour, from November 1986 to October 1987. In 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present \\"the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way\\". Gabriel used musicians from WOMAD to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern, and European textures, using the National Sound Archive in London for additional inspiration. The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record. When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as Passion in June 1989. It won Gabriel a Grammy Award for Best New Age Performance and a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score ‚Äì Motion Picture. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats, which sold 2 million copies in the US. From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to So, entitled Us. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time. Gabriel's introspection within the context of the album Us can be seen in the first single release \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a disturbing video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in \\"Come Talk To Me\\" directed by Matt Mahurin, which featured backing vocals by Sin√©ad O'Connor. O'Connor also lent vocals to \\"Blood of Eden\\", directed by Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to Adam's rib for inspiration. The result was one of Gabriel's most personal albums. It met with less success than So, reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" and the funkier \\"Steam\\", which evoked memories of \\"Sledgehammer\\". Gabriel followed the release of the album with a world tour (with Paula Cole or Joy Askew filling O'Connor's vocal role) and accompanying double CD and DVD Secret World Live in 1994. Gabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the Us album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as Helen Chadwick, Rebecca Horn, Nils-Udo, Andy Goldsworthy, David Mach and Yayoi Kusama collaborated to create original artworks for each of the 11 songs on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video All About Us and the interactive CD-ROM Xplora1. Gabriel won three more Grammy Awards, all in the Music Video category. He won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" and \\"Steam\\" respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for his Secret World Live video. 1997‚Äì2009: OVO and Up In 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the Millennium Dome Show, a live multimedia performance staged in the Millennium Dome in London throughout 2000. Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting. He also felt that management, while succeeding to get the building finished on time, failed to understand the artistic side of the show and its content. Gabriel's soundtrack was released as OVO in June 2000. The Genesis greatest hits album Turn It On Again: The Hits (1999) features Gabriel sharing vocals with Phil Collins on a new version of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" entitled \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", produced by Trevor Horn. He stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) with worldbeat music. Released in June 2002, Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit- Proof Fence received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score ‚Äì Motion Picture. Up, Gabriel's first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at Virgin Records pushed Gabriel to complete it. Up reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: Growing Up Live (2003) and Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2005). In 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford, and Collins to organise the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Gabriel produced and performed at the Eden Project Live 8 concert in July 2005. He joined Yusuf Islam on stage to perform \\"Wild World\\" during Nelson Mandela's 46664 concert. In 2005, FIFA asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Gabriel performed John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". In November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Rome presented Gabriel with the Man of Peace award. The award, presented by former President of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev and Walter Veltroni, Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel's extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician Moby. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel's contribution to music was described as \\"vast and enduring.\\" Gabriel at the 2007 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Gabriel took on a project with the BBC World Service's competition \\"The Next Big Thing\\" to find the world's best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with William Orbit, Geoff Travis, and Ang√©lique Kidjo. In June 2008, Gabriel released Big Blue Ball, an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s. He planned its release in the US without assistance from a label; he raised ¬£2 million towards the recording and distribution of the album with Ingenious Media with the worldwide release handled through Warner Bros. Records.Durman, Paul. Gabriel deals a blow to the record business, The Times. 21 January 2007. Gabriel appeared on a nationwide tour for the album in 2009. Gabriel was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists. Gabriel contributed to the WALL-E soundtrack in 2008 with Thomas Newman, including the film's closing song, \\"Down to Earth\\", for which they received the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the 2008 Academy Awards telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of \\"Down to Earth\\" from WALL-E to 65 seconds. John Legend and the Soweto Gospel Choir performed the song in his stead. Gabriel's 2009 tour appearances included Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. His first ever performance in Peru was held in Lima on 20 March 2009, during his second visit to the country. His concert in Mexico City, on 27 March 2009, attracted more than 38,000 fans. On 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness. The show included two tracks from the then- forthcoming Scratch My Back: Paul Simon's \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" and the Magnetic Fields' \\"The Book of Love\\". 2009‚Äìpresent: Scratch My Back, New Blood, Rated PG, Flotsam and Jetsam Peter Gabriel performing at the 2011 Skoll Awards. In 2009, Gabriel recorded Scratch My Back, an album of cover songs by various artists including David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor, and Neil Young. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists' song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as I'll Scratch Yours, but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold. Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with John Metcalfe. Released in February 2010, Scratch My Back reached No. 12 in the UK. Gabriel toured worldwide with the New Blood Tour from March 2010 to July 2012 with a 54-piece orchestra and his daughter Melanie and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun on backup vocals. The follow-up, And I'll Scratch Yours, was released in September 2013. During the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the Scratch My Back concept and, with Metcalfe's assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, New Blood, was released in October 2011. In September 2012, Gabriel kicked off his Back to Front Tour which featured So performed in its entirety with the original musicians who played on the album, to mark its 25th anniversary. When the opening leg finished a month later, Gabriel took one year off to travel the world with his children. The tour resumed with a European leg from September 2013 to December 2014. Actor John Cusack made two cameo appearances that saw him hand Gabriel a ghetto blaster, a homage to his scene in Say Anything. In 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. They performed Gabriel's \\"Washing of the Water\\" together. Gabriel performed \\"Heroes\\" by David Bowie with an orchestra at a concert in Berlin to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, in November 2014. In 2016, he was featured on \\"A.I.\\" by American pop-rock band OneRepublic. In June 2016, Gabriel released the single \\"I'm Amazing\\". The song was written several years prior, in part as a tribute to Muhammad Ali. That month, he embarked on a joint tour with Sting titled the Rock Paper Scissors North American Tour. Gabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of Rated PG, a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career. The song selection spans over 30 years and includes tracks that had never been released on an official Gabriel album previously, including \\"Down to Earth\\" (from WALL-E) and \\"That'll Do\\" (from Babe: Pig in the City) an Oscar-nominated collaboration with Randy Newman. Initially only released on vinyl for Record Store Day on 13 April, the album was eventually released on digital streaming services later that month. Later that same year, Gabriel issued another digital release on 13 September titled Flotsam and Jetsam, a collection of B-sides, remixes and rarities that span Gabriel's entire solo career from 1976 to 2016, including his first solo recording, a cover of the Beatles' song \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  Musicians and collaborators as a solo artist  Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and Stick player Tony Levin performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for Scratch My Back, the soundtracks Passion and Long Walk Home, and the New Blood Tour. Guitar player David Rhodes has been Gabriel's guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to So, Jerry Marotta was Gabriel's preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the So and Us albums and tours Marotta was replaced by Manu Katch√©, who was then replaced by Ged Lynch on parts of the Up album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top- flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite, and Lanois to musicians such as Natalie Merchant, Elizabeth Fraser, L. Shankar, Trent Reznor, Youssou N'Dour, Larry Fast, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Kate Bush, Ane Brun, Paula Cole, John Giblin, Dave Gregory, Peter Hammill, Papa Wemba, Manu Katch√©, Bayete, Milton Nascimento, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland and OneRepublic. Over the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer Kate Bush several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel's \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" and \\"No Self Control\\" in 1980, and female lead vocal for \\"Don't Give Up\\" (a Top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of Roy Harper's \\"Another Day\\" was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared. He also collaborated with Laurie Anderson on two versions of her composition \\"Excellent Birds\\" ‚Äì one for her 1984 album Mister Heartbreak, and another version called \\"This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\\", which appeared on cassette and CD versions of So. Gabriel sang (along with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds) on \\"Everywhere I Go\\", from the Call's 1986 release, Reconciled. On Toni Childs' 1994 CD, The Woman's Boat, Gabriel sang on the track, \\"I Met a Man\\". In 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of Babe: Pig in the City as the singer of the song \\"That'll Do\\", written by Randy Newman. The song was nominated for an Academy Award, and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year's Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film Shall We Dance?, singing a cover version of \\"The Book of Love\\" by the Magnetic Fields. Gabriel appeared on Robbie Robertson's self- titled album, singing on \\"Fallen Angel\\"; co-wrote two Tom Robinson singles; and appeared on Joni Mitchell's 1988 album Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm, on the track \\"My Secret Place\\". In 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song \\"When You're Falling\\" on Afro Celt Sound System's Volume 3: Further in Time. In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan. Gabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician BT, who also worked on the OVO soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT's home in California. He also sang the lyrics for Deep Forest on their theme song for the movie Strange Days. In addition, Gabriel has appeared on Angelique Kidjo's 2007 album Djin Djin, singing on the song \\"Salala\\". Gabriel has recorded a cover of the Vampire Weekend single \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" with Hot Chip, where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line \\"But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too\\" with \\"It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name.\\"  WOMAD and other projects  Gabriel's interest in world music was first apparent on his third solo album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in The Atlantic in 2019: \\"When Peter Gabriel moved toward 'world music' four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as 'exotic,' and lyrics meant to change lives.\\" This influence has increased over time, and he is the driving force behind the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) movement. Gabriel said: Gabriel created the Real World Studios and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as Yungchen Lhamo, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Youssou N'dour. He has a longstanding interest in human rights and launched Witness, a charity that trains human rights activists to use video and online technologies to expose human rights abuses. In 2006, his work with WITNESS and his long-standing support of peace and human rights causes was recognised by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with the Man of Peace award. In the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating Xplora (the world's largest selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the EVE CD-ROM. EVE was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the Starwave Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d'Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996. In 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile Geoffrey Oryema's \\"Land of Anaka\\", appearing on Oryema's first album Exile, released on Gabriel's Real World label. In 1994, Gabriel starred in Breck Eisner's short film Recon as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer's identity. Gabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting Georgia State University's Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with bonobo apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song \\"Animal Nation\\", which was performed on Gabriel's 2002 \\"Growing Up\\" tour and was featured on the Growing Up Live DVD and The Wild Thornberrys Movie soundtrack.) Gabriel's desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication. He was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution (OD2), one of the first online music download services. Its technology is used by MSN Music UK and others, and has become the dominant music download technology platform for stores in Europe. OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant Nokia in October 2006 for $60 million. Gabriel is co-founder (with Brian Eno) of a musicians union called Mudda, short for \\"magnificent union of digitally downloading artists.\\" In 2000, Peter Gabriel collaborated with Zucchero, Anggun and others in a charity for kids with AIDS. Erick Benzi wrote words and music and Patrick Bruel, Stephan Eicher, Faudel, Lokua Kanza, Laam, Nourith, Axelle Red have accepted to sing it. In 2003, Gabriel contributed a song for the video game Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. In 2004, Gabriel contributed another song (\\"Curtains\\") and contributed voice work on another game in the Myst franchise, Myst IV: Revelation. In June 2005, Gabriel and broadcast industry entrepreneur David Engelke purchased Solid State Logic, a manufacturer of mixing consoles and digital audio workstations. In May 2008, Gabriel's Real World Studios, in partnership with Bowers & Wilkins, started the Bowers & Wilkins Music Club ‚Äì later known as Society of Sound ‚Äì a subscription-based music retail site. Albums are currently available in either Apple Lossless or FLAC format. He is one of the founding supporters of Asteroid Day.  Activist for humanitarian causes  In 1986, he started what has become a longstanding association with Amnesty International, becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty's Human rights concerts ‚Äì a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998. He performed during the six- concert A Conspiracy of Hope US tour in June 1986; the twenty-concert Human Rights Now! world tour in 1988; the Chile: Embrace of Hope Concert in 1990 and at The Paris Concert For Amnesty International in 1998. He also performed in Amnesty's Secret Policeman's Ball benefit shows in collaboration with other artists and friends such as Lou Reed, David Gilmour and Youssou N'Dour; Gabriel closed those concerts performing his anti-apartheid anthem \\"Biko\\". He spoke of his support for Amnesty on NBC's Today Show in 1986. Inspired by the social activism he encountered in his work with Amnesty, in 1992, Gabriel co- founded WITNESS, a non-profit organisation that equips, trains and supports locally based organisations worldwide to use video and the internet in human rights documentation and advocacy. In 1995, Gabriel and Cape Verdean human rights activist Vera Duarte were awarded the North‚ÄìSouth Prize in its inaugural year. Peter Gabriel at WITNESS Gala 2007 In the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur Richard Branson discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts. On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Kofi Annan serves as Chair of the Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as Deputy Chair. The other members of the group are Martti Ahtisaari, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Gra√ßa Machel, Mary Robinson, and Ernesto Zedillo. Desmond Tutu is an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel. The Elders use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach. In November 2007, Gabriel's non-profit group WITNESS launched The Hub, a participatory media site for human rights. In September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International's 2008 Ambassador of Conscience Award. In the same month, he received Quadriga United We Care award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadiƒá, Eckart H√∂fling and Wikipedia. The award was presented to him by Queen Silvia of Sweden. In 2010, Gabriel lent his support to the campaign to release Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery. In December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Gabriel was quoted: Gabriel has criticised Air France for their continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. In a letter to the airline, Gabriel wrote that in laboratories, \\"primates are violently force-fed chemicals, inflicted with brain damage, crippled, addicted to cocaine or alcohol, deprived of food and water, or psychologically tormented and ultimately killed.\\" In March 2014, Gabriel publicly supported #withsyria, a campaign to rally support for victims of the Syrian Civil War. In November 2014, Gabriel, along with Pussy riot, and Iron & Wine supported Hong Kong protesters at Hong Kong's Lennon Wall in their efforts. In March 2015, Gabriel was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of South Australia in recognition of his commitment to creativity and its transformational power in building power in building peace and understanding. He composed the song \\"The Veil\\" for Oliver Stone's film Snowden.  Politics  Gabriel has been described as one of rock's most political musicians by AllMusic. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday tragedy, Gabriel joined several left-wing figures such as Peter Hain, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Benn, Ken Loach, John Pilger and Adrian Mitchell in voicing his support for a demonstration in London calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. At the 1997 general election, he declared his support for the Labour Party, which won that election by a landslide after 18 years out of power, led by Tony Blair. In 1998, he was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to Labour. However, he subsequently distanced himself from the Labour government following Tony Blair's support for George W. Bush and Britain's involvement in the Iraq War, which he strongly opposed. Gabriel later explained his decision for funding Labour, saying, \\"after all those years of Thatcher, that was the only time I've put money into a political party because I wanted to help get rid of the Tory government of that time\\". In 2005, Gabriel gave a Green Party of England and Wales general election candidate special permission to record a cover of his song \\"Don't Give Up\\" for his campaign. In 2010, The Guardian described Gabriel as \\"a staunch advocate of proportional representation\\". In 2013, he stated that he had become more interested in online petitioning organisations to effect change than traditional party politics. In 2012, Gabriel condemned the use of his music by the American Conservative talk radio personality Rush Limbaugh during a controversial segment in which Limbaugh vilified Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke. A statement on behalf of Gabriel read: \\"Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh's extraordinary attack on Sandra Fluke. It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter's work that he would never approve such a use. He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair, aggressive and ignorant comments.\\" In 2016, Gabriel supported the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the referendum on the issue. Gabriel has declared his support for the two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In 2014, he contributed songs to a new compilation album to raise funds for humanitarian organisations aiding Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. Gabriel was quoted: \\"I am certain that Israelis and Palestinians will both benefit from a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. We have watched Palestinians suffer for too long, especially in Gaza. I am not, and never was, anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic, but I oppose the policy of the Israeli government, oppose injustice and oppose the occupation ... I am proud to be one of the voices asking the Israeli government: 'Where is the two-state solution that you wanted so much?' and clearly say that enough is enough.\\" In 2019, Gabriel was among 50 artists who urged the BBC to ask for the Eurovision Song Contest to be moved out of Israel, citing human rights concerns. Gabriel has been in support of the Armenian Genocide recognition. In October 2020, he posted a message on social media in support of Armenia and Artsakh in regards to the Nagorno-Karabakh war. He stated \\"The fighting that has now broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia is really horrific and we need to lobby whoever we can to encourage a ceasefire, but hearing reports that President Erdogan has now lined up 80,000 Turkish troops on the Armenian border is a terrifying prospect, full of the dark echoes of history.\\"  In popular culture  Gabriel's music featured prominently on the popular 1980s television show Miami Vice. The songs include \\"The Rhythm of the Heat\\" and \\"Biko\\" (from \\"Evan\\"), \\"Red Rain\\" (from \\"Stone's War\\"), \\"Mercy Street\\" (from \\"Killshot\\"), \\"Sledgehammer\\" (from \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\"), \\"We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\\" (from \\"Forgive Us Our Debts\\" and \\"Deliver Us from Evil\\"), and \\"Don't Give Up\\" (from \\"Redemption in Blood\\"). With seven songs used total, Gabriel had the most music featured by a solo artist in the series, and he is the only artist to have had a song used in four of Vice's five seasons. Five of the nine tracks on his most popular album So were used in the series. \\"Games Without Frontiers\\", \\"Here Comes the Flood\\", \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" and \\"We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\\" each appear in separate episodes of the FX Channel spy drama The Americans. Gabriel's cover of David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" was featured in the fourth season finale of Big Love, as well as the first season and the ending scene of Stranger Things season 3. The song also features in 'Children of Mars', a 2020 episode of the web series Star Trek: Short Treks. Gabriel's cover of \\"My Body is a Cage\\" (song by Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire) was featured in the House episode \\"Out of the Chute\\", was part of the soundtrack for the video game Assassin's Creed III, appeared in the trailers for John Carter and Helstrom, was used as a part the Santa Clara Vanguard's winning show in 2018, and plays a major role in the key scene of the TV-series Dark in its second season. Gabriel's song 'Intruder' was played over the end credits of episode 9 of season 2 of Netflix original series Mindhunter.  Personal life  Gabriel has married twice and has four children. In 1971, at age 21, he married Jill Moore, daughter of Lord Moore of Wolvercote. They had two daughters, Anna- Marie (born 1974) and Melanie (born 1976). Anna-Marie is a filmmaker who filmed and directed Gabriel's live DVDs Growing Up on Tour: A Family Portrait and Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped. Melanie is a musician who has been a backing vocalist in her father's band since 2002. The marriage became increasingly strained, culminating in Moore's affair with David Lord, the co- producer of Gabriel's fourth album. It ended in a divorce in 1987, and Gabriel went through a period of depression and attended therapy sessions for six years. For a time after his divorce, Gabriel lived with American actress Rosanna Arquette. In 2002, Gabriel married Meabh Flynn, 21 years his junior. They have two sons, Isaac Ralph (born 2001) and Luc (born 2008). He has resided in Wiltshire for many years and runs Real World Studios from Box, Wiltshire. He previously lived in the Woolley Valley near Bath, Somerset. In 2010, he joined a campaign to stop agricultural development in the valley, which had also inspired his first solo single, \\"Solsbury Hill\\", in 1977.

SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions. Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the security policy, and streamlines the amount of software involved with security policy enforcement. The key concepts underlying SELinux can be traced to several earlier projects by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Overview From NSA Security-enhanced Linux Team: > NSA Security-Enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel and > utilities to provide a strong, flexible, mandatory access control (MAC) > architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. It provides an > enhanced mechanism to enforce the separation of information based on > confidentiality and integrity requirements, which allows threats of > tampering, and bypassing of application security mechanisms, to be addressed > and enables the confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or > flawed applications. It includes a set of sample security policy > configuration files designed to meet common, general-purpose security goals. A Linux kernel integrating SELinux enforces mandatory access control policies that confine user programs and system services, as well as access to files and network resources. Limiting privilege to the minimum required to work reduces or eliminates the ability of these programs and daemons to cause harm if faulty or compromised (for example via buffer overflows or misconfigurations). This confinement mechanism operates independently of the traditional Linux (discretionary) access control mechanisms. It has no concept of a \\"root\\" superuser, and does not share the well-known shortcomings of the traditional Linux security mechanisms, such as a dependence on setuid/setgid binaries. The security of an \\"unmodified\\" Linux system (a system without SELinux) depends on the correctness of the kernel, of all the privileged applications, and of each of their configurations. A fault in any one of these areas may allow the compromise of the entire system. In contrast, the security of a \\"modified\\" system (based on an SELinux kernel) depends primarily on the correctness of the kernel and its security-policy configuration. While problems with the correctness or configuration of applications may allow the limited compromise of individual user programs and system daemons, they do not necessarily pose a threat to the security of other user programs and system daemons or to the security of the system as a whole. From a purist perspective, SELinux provides a hybrid of concepts and capabilities drawn from mandatory access controls, mandatory integrity controls, role-based access control (RBAC), and type enforcement architecture. History The earliest work directed toward standardizing an approach providing mandatory and discretionary access controls (MAC and DAC) within a UNIX (more precisely, POSIX) computing environment can be attributed to the National Security Agency's Trusted UNIX (TRUSIX) Working Group, which met from 1987 to 1991 and published one Rainbow Book (#020A), and produced a formal model and associated evaluation evidence prototype (#020B) that was ultimately unpublished. SELinux was designed to demonstrate the value of mandatory access controls to the Linux community and how such controls could be added to Linux. Originally, the patches that make up SELinux had to be explicitly applied to the Linux kernel source; SELinux was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in the 2.6 series of the Linux kernel. The NSA, the original primary developer of SELinux, released the first version to the open source development community under the GNU GPL on December 22, 2000.Compare The software was merged into the mainline Linux kernel 2.6.0-test3, released on 8 August 2003. Other significant contributors include Red Hat, Network Associates, Secure Computing Corporation, Tresys Technology, and Trusted Computer Solutions. Experimental ports of the FLASK/TE implementation have been made available via the TrustedBSD Project for the FreeBSD and Darwin operating systems. Security-Enhanced Linux implements the Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK). Such a kernel contains architectural components prototyped in the Fluke operating system. These provide general support for enforcing many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the concepts of type enforcement, role-based access control, and multilevel security. FLASK, in turn, was based on DTOS, a Mach- derived Distributed Trusted Operating System, as well as on Trusted Mach, a research project from Trusted Information Systems that had an influence on the design and implementation of DTOS. Users, policies and security contexts SELinux users and roles do not have to be related to the actual system users and roles. For every current user or process, SELinux assigns a three string context consisting of a username, role, and domain (or type). This system is more flexible than normally required: as a rule, most of the real users share the same SELinux username, and all access control is managed through the third tag, the domain. The circumstances under which a process is allowed into a certain domain must be configured in the policies. The command \`runcon\` allows for the launching of a process into an explicitly specified context (user, role, and domain), but SELinux may deny the transition if it is not approved by the policy. Files, network ports, and other hardware also have an SELinux context, consisting of a name, role (seldom used), and type. In the case of file systems, mapping between files and the security contexts is called labeling. The labeling is defined in policy files but can also be manually adjusted without changing the policies. Hardware types are quite detailed, for instance, \`bin_t\` (all files in the folder /bin) or \`postgresql_port_t\` (PostgreSQL port, 5432). The SELinux context for a remote file system can be specified explicitly at mount time. SELinux adds the \`-Z\` switch to the shell commands \`ls\`, \`ps\`, and some others, allowing the security context of the files or process to be seen. Typical policy rules consist of explicit permissions, for example, which domains the user must possess to perform certain actions with the given target (read, execute, or, in case of network port, bind or connect), and so on. More complex mappings are also possible, involving roles and security levels. A typical policy consists of a mapping (labeling) file, a rule file, and an interface file, that define the domain transition. These three files must be compiled together with the SELinux tools to produce a single policy file. The resulting policy file can be loaded into the kernel to make it active. Loading and unloading policies does not require a reboot. The policy files are either hand written or can be generated from the more user friendly SELinux management tool. They are normally tested in permissive mode first, where violations are logged but allowed. The \`audit2allow\` tool can be used later to produce additional rules that extend the policy to allow all legitimate activities of the application being confined. Features SELinux features include: * Clean separation of policy from enforcement * Well-defined policy interfaces * Support for applications querying the policy and enforcing access control (for example, crond running jobs in the correct context) * Independence of specific policies and policy languages * Independence of specific security-label formats and contents * Individual labels and controls for kernel objects and services * Support for policy changes * Separate measures for protecting system integrity (domain- type) and data confidentiality (multilevel security) * Flexible policy * Controls over process initialization and inheritance, and program execution * Controls over file systems, directories, files, and open file descriptors * Controls over sockets, messages, and network interfaces * Controls over the use of \\"capabilities\\" * Cached information on access-decisions via the Access Vector Cache (AVC) * Default-deny policy (anything not explicitly specified in the policy is disallowed) Implementations SELinux has been implemented in Android since version 4.3. Among free community-supported GNU/Linux distributions, Fedora was one of the earliest adopters, including support for it by default since Fedora Core 2. Other distributions include support for it such as Debian as of version 9 Stretch release and Ubuntu as of 8.04 Hardy Heron. As of version 11.1, openSUSE contains SELinux \\"basic enablement\\". SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 features SELinux as a \\"technology preview\\". SELinux is popular in systems based on linux containers, such as CoreOS Container Linux and rkt. It is useful as an additional security control to help further enforce isolation between deployed containers and their host. SELinux is available since 2005 as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 4 and all future releases. This presence is also reflected in corresponding versions of CentOS and Scientific Linux. The supported policy in RHEL4 is targeted policy which aims for maximum ease of use and thus is not as restrictive as it might be. Future versions of RHEL are planned to have more targets in the targeted policy which will mean more restrictive policies. Use scenarios SELinux can potentially control which activities a system allows each user, process, and daemon, with very precise specifications. It is used to confine daemons such as database engines or web servers that have clearly defined data access and activity rights. This limits potential harm from a confined daemon that becomes compromised. Command-line utilities include: \`chcon\`, \`restorecon\`, \`restorecond\`, \`runcon\`, \`secon\`, \`fixfiles\`, \`setfiles\`, \`load_policy\`, \`booleans\`, \`getsebool\`, \`setsebool\`, \`togglesebool\` \`setenforce\`, \`semodule\`, \`postfix-nochroot\`, \`check-selinux-installation\`, \`semodule_package\`, \`checkmodule\`, \`selinux-config-enforcing\`, \`selinuxenabled\`, and \`selinux-policy-upgrade\` Examples To put SELinux into enforcing mode: :\`$ sudo setenforce 1\` To query the SELinux status: :\`$ getenforce\` Comparison with AppArmor SELinux represents one of several possible approaches to the problem of restricting the actions that installed software can take. Another popular alternative is called AppArmor and is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), openSUSE, and Debian-based platforms. AppArmor was developed as a component to the now-defunct Immunix Linux platform. Because AppArmor and SELinux differ radically from one another, they form distinct alternatives for software control. Whereas SELinux re-invents certain concepts to provide access to a more expressive set of policy choices, AppArmor was designed to be simple by extending the same administrative semantics used for DAC up to the mandatory access control level. There are several key differences: * One important difference is that AppArmor identifies file system objects by path name instead of inode. This means that, for example, a file that is inaccessible may become accessible under AppArmor when a hard link is created to it, while SELinux would deny access through the newly created hard link.  As a result, AppArmor can be said not to be a type enforcement system, as files are not assigned a type; instead, they are merely referenced in a configuration file. * SELinux and AppArmor also differ significantly in how they are administered and how they integrate into the system. * Since it endeavors to recreate traditional DAC controls with MAC-level enforcement, AppArmor's set of operations is also considerably smaller than those available under most SELinux implementations. For example, AppArmor's set of operations consist of: read, write, append, execute, lock, and link. Most SELinux implementations will support numbers of operations orders of magnitude more than that. For example, SELinux will usually support those same permissions, but also includes controls for mknod, binding to network sockets, implicit use of POSIX capabilities, loading and unloading kernel modules, various means of accessing shared memory, etc. * There are no controls in AppArmor for categorically bounding POSIX capabilities. Since the current implementation of capabilities contains no notion of a subject for the operation (only the actor and the operation) it is usually the job of the MAC layer to prevent privileged operations on files outside the actor's enforced realm of control (i.e. \\"Sandbox\\"). AppArmor can prevent its own policy from being altered, and prevent file systems from being mounted/unmounted, but does nothing to prevent users from stepping outside their approved realms of control.  For example, it may be deemed beneficial for help desk employees to change ownership or permissions on certain files even if they don't own them (for example, on a departmental file share). You obviously don't want to give the user(s) root on the box so you give them \`CAP_FOWNER\` or \`CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE\`. Under SELinux you (or your platform vendor) can configure SELinux to deny all capabilities to otherwise unconfined users, then create confined domains for the employee to be able to transition into after logging in, one that can exercise those capabilities, but only upon files of the appropriate type. * There is no notion of multilevel security with AppArmor, thus there is no hard BLP or Biba enforcement available. . * AppArmor configuration is done using solely regular flat files. SELinux (by default in most implementations) uses a combination of flat files (used by administrators and developers to write human readable policy before it's compiled) and extended attributes. * SELinux supports the concept of a \\"remote policy server\\" (configurable via /etc/selinux/semanage.conf) as an alternative source for policy configuration. Central management of AppArmor is usually complicated considerably since administrators must decide between configuration deployment tools being run as root (to allow policy updates) or configured manually on each server. Similar systems Isolation of processes can also be accomplished by mechanisms such as virtualization; the OLPC project, for example, in its first implementation sandboxed individual applications in lightweight Vservers. Also, the NSA has adopted some of the SELinux concepts in Security-Enhanced Android.

In practice, Gouraud shading is most often used to achieve continuous lighting on Triangle meshes by computing the lighting at the corners of each triangle and linearly interpolating the resulting colours for each pixel covered by the triangle. Gouraud first published the technique in 1971.  Description  Gouraud shading works as follows: An estimate to the surface normal of each vertex in a polygonal 3D model is either specified for each vertex or found by averaging the surface normals of the polygons that meet at each vertex. Using these estimates, lighting computations based on a reflection model, e.g. the Phong reflection model, are then performed to produce colour intensities at the vertices. For each screen pixel that is covered by the polygonal mesh, colour intensities can then be interpolated from the colour values calculated at the vertices.  Comparison with other shading techniques  Comparison of flat shading and Gouraud shading. Gouraud shading is considered superior to flat shading and requires significantly less processing than Phong shading, but usually results in a faceted look. In comparison to Phong shading, Gouraud shading's strength and weakness lies in its interpolation. If a mesh covers more pixels in screen space than it has vertices, interpolating colour values from samples of expensive lighting calculations at vertices is less processor intensive than performing the lighting calculation for each pixel as in Phong shading. However, highly localized lighting effects (such as specular highlights, e.g. the glint of reflected light on the surface of an apple) will not be rendered correctly, and if a highlight lies in the middle of a polygon, but does not spread to the polygon's vertex, it will not be apparent in a Gouraud rendering; conversely, if a highlight occurs at the vertex of a polygon, it will be rendered correctly at this vertex (as this is where the lighting model is applied), but will be spread unnaturally across all neighboring polygons via the interpolation method. The problem is easily spotted in a rendering which ought to have a specular highlight moving smoothly across the surface of a model as it rotates. Gouraud shading will instead produce a highlight continuously fading in and out across neighboring portions of the model, peaking in intensity when the intended specular highlight passes over a vertex of the model. While this problem can be fixed by increasing the density of vertices in the object, at some point the diminishing returns of this approach will favour switching to a more detailed shading model. Image:Gouraud_low_anim.gifA Gouraud-shaded sphere-like mesh - note the poor behaviour of the specular highlight. Image:Gouraud_high.gifAnother sphere- like mesh rendered with a very high polygon count.  Gouraud shading uses linear interpolation  A comparison between Gouraud shading (linear interpolation) and non-Gouraud shading (perspective correct interpolation) It is a common misconception that Gouraud shading is any interpolation of colors between vertices. For example, perspective correct interpolation. The original paper makes it clear Gouraud shading is specifically linear interpolation of color between vertices. By default most modern GPUs use perspective correct interpolation between vertices which produces a different result than Gouraud shading. The differences will be especially pronounced on polygons stretching deep into the view where the differences between linear interpolation and perspective correct interpolation will be more pronounced.  Mach bands  Any linear interpolation of intensity causes derivative discontinuities which triggers Mach bands, a common visual artifact of Gouraud Shading.

Life Richard Leveridge was born in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, in 1670, and in 1695 became the leading bass singer in the United Company managed by Christopher Rich at Drury Lane, after the defection of several leading singers from Rich's company.O.

Purcell himself remained loyal to the company, and for several months Leveridge worked closely with him. It is likely that \\"Arise, ye subterranean winds\\" in the music (attributed to Purcell) for The Tempest was written for him. After Purcell's death he continued to work with composers Daniel Purcell and Jeremiah Clarke, and took a leading part in Clarke's Ode upon the death of Mr Purcell at Drury Lane.Baldwin and Wilson, June 1970, p. 523. Leveridge also composed, and in February 1699 all three provided music for Motteux's adaptation of Fletcher's The Island Princess, in which Leveridge's performance, particularly his 'Enthusiastick Song',L.M. Middleton, Old D.N.B., 'Leveridge, Richard'. engendered great enthusiasm among its hearers.K. Lowerre, Music and Musicians on the London Stage, 1695-1705 (Ashgate/Routledge, London and New York 2009/2016), pp. 231-32 (Google). At various times between 1697 and 1728 Leveridge published volumes of his own songs, and numerous single items including his popular theatre songs appeared as separate printed sheets throughout his career. After a spell in Dublin he returned to London in 1702 for a revival of The Island Princess and a new production of Macbeth billed as \\"with music Vocal and Instrumental, all new Composed by Mr Leveridge\\". He sang the role of Hecate in this work for nearly 50 years, and the music remained popular for more than a century after his death.R. E. Moore, 'The Music to Macbeth', Musical Quarterly xlvii (1961), pp. 22‚Äì40; R. Fiske: 'The Macbeth Music', Music and Letters xlv (1964), pp. 114‚Äì25. The youthful portrait of Dick Leveridge, c. 1710‚Äì1720 Leveridge continued to sing Purcell's operas and masques in the revivals, at Drury Lane in 1703‚Äì08, of The Fairy-Queen, Timon of Athens, Amphitrion, Libertine Destroyed, Tempest, King Arthur, Indian Queen, and ≈ídipus.L.M. Middleton, 'Leveridge, Richard', Old D.N.B. He also participated in the introduction of opera in the Italian style from 1705, appearing in Arsino√´ (1705), Camilla (1706), Rosamond (1707), Thomyris (1707), and Love's Triumph (1708). Some of these productions had mixed English and Italian singers (bilingual performances),W.S. Rockstro, The Life of George Frederick Handel (Cambridge University Press, 1883), pp. 58-60 (Google). but when the fashion became entirely Italian Leveridge was replaced in the bass roles by the Italian basso Giuseppe Maria Boschi.European Magazine and London Review October 1793, p. 243. He then began a short association with Handel, in 1713 to 1714, and acted in the first performances of Il pastor fido and Teseo and played Argantes in a revival of Rinaldo. In this period he sang with Nicolini,So stated by Sir John Hawkins, 1776, V, pp. 182‚Äì83 (see below). who was in London from 1708 to 1712 and in the seasons of 1714‚Äì17.E. Dannreuther, 'Nicolini, Nicolino Grimaldi, detto', in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians ed. Fuller Maitland, III (Macmillan & Co. 1922), p. 373. Later in his career, in 1731, he is known to have taken the role of Polypheme (who has the aria O ruddier than the cherry) in a performance of Acis and Galatea.Presumably this was the London revival performance of the original work which just preceded Handel's reworking of the opera. In 1714, he moved to work at the new theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields, managed by entrepreneur John Rich. Remaining there for most of his career, he returned to his English repertoire and a new form, the musical Afterpiece. These lightweight works were often comic, and in 1716 Leveridge produced his own afterpiece, Pyramus and Thisbe. For this comic parody of Italian opera, he wrote the music, adapting the words from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and sang the role of Pyramus.Olive Baldwin and Thelma Wilson, \\"Leveridge, Richard (1670‚Äì1758)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 12 July 2008 See also, O.

The humour of his songs, and indeed of his conversation, consisted in exhortations to despise riches and the means of attaining them; to drown care by drinking; to enjoy the present hour, and to set reflection and death at defiance. With such a disposition as this, Leveridge could not fail to be a welcome visitor at all clubs and assemblies, where the avowed purpose of meeting was an oblivion of care; and being ever ready to contribute to the promotion of social mirth, he made himself many friends, from whose bounty he derived all the comforts that in an extreme old age he was capable of enjoying.\\"Sir John Hawkins, A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, in Five Volumes (T. Payne and Son, London 1776), Vol. 5, Chapter 9, pp. 182‚Äì83. In 1789 Charles Burney wrote of him: \\"I remember his singing Ghosts of every occupation, and several of Purcell's base songs, occasionally, in a style which forty years ago seemed antediluvian: but as he generally was the representative of Pluto, Neptune, or some ancient divinity, it corresponded perfectly with his figure and character. He was not only a celebrated singer of convivial songs, but the writer and composer of many that were in great favour with singers and hearers of a certain class, who more piously performed the rites of Comus and Bacchus, than those of Minerva and Apollo.\\"Charles Burney, A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period Volume 4 (Author, London 1789), p. 215 Portraits The National Portrait Gallery, London has an oil portrait of the young Richard Leveridge, c. 1710‚Äì20, by an unknown artist, which is on display at the Handel House Museum, London.See portrait Accession NPG 6596 at National Portrait Gallery website.

He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s. He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice, which included writing rock arrangements of classical music. After leaving the Nice in 1970, he was a founding member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), one of the early progressive rock supergroups. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s, becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era. Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELP's music on albums such as Tarkus (1971) and Brain Salad Surgery (1973), combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format.Lupis, pp. 6‚Äì8. Following ELP's break-up at the end of the 1970s, Emerson pursued a solo career, composed several film soundtracks, and formed the bands Emerson, Lake & Powell and 3 to carry on in the style of ELP. In the early 1990s, Emerson rejoined ELP, which reunited for two more albums and several tours before breaking up again in the late 1990s. Emerson also reunited the Nice in 2002 for a tour. During the 2000s, Emerson resumed his solo career, including touring with his own Keith Emerson Band featuring guitarist Marc Bonilla and collaborating with several orchestras. He reunited with ELP bandmate Greg Lake in 2010 for a duo tour, culminating in a one-off ELP reunion show in London to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. Emerson's last album, The Three Fates Project, with Marc Bonilla and Terje Mikkelsen, was released in 2012. Emerson reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism, and in his later years developed nerve damage that hampered his playing, making him anxious about upcoming performances. He killed himself on 11 March 2016 at his home in Santa Monica, California. Emerson was widely regarded as one of the top keyboard players of the progressive rock era. AllMusic describes Emerson as \\"perhaps the greatest, most technically accomplished keyboardist in rock history\\". Early life Emerson was born on 2 November 1944 in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. The family had been evacuated from southern England during World War II, after which they returned south and settled in Goring-by-Sea, West Sussex. Emerson attended West Tarring School in Tarring. His father Noel was an amateur pianist, while his mother was not musical. They arranged piano lessons for Emerson when he was eight; he received tuition from \\"local little old ladies\\" and learned to read music. His studies in Western classical music largely inspired his own style in his professional career which often incorporated jazz and rock elements. Although Emerson did not own a record player, he enjoyed listening to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style \\"On the Rebound\\" and the work of Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe \\"Mr Piano\\" Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: \\"I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone.\\" Emerson became interested in the Hammond organ after hearing jazz organist Jack McDuff perform \\"Rock Candy\\", and the Hammond became his instrument of choice in the late 1960s. Emerson acquired his first Hammond organ, an L-100 model, at the age of 15 or 16, on hire purchase. Emerson's initial plan was for a non- musical career while playing the piano on the side. Upon leaving school he worked at Lloyds Bank Registrars where he played the piano in the bar at lunch times and local pubs at nights. He was ultimately fired from the bank. Career 1965‚Äì1970: Early groups and The Nice While performing in the Worthing area, Emerson received an offer to join his first professional group, the T-Bones, the backing band of blues singer Gary Farr. The group toured the UK and France before they disintegrated. Emerson then joined The V.I.P.'s; his noted flamboyance began when a fight broke out during a performance in France. Instructed by the band to keep playing, he produced some explosion and machine gun sounds with the Hammond organ, which stopped the fight. His band members told him to repeat the stunt at the next concert. In 1967, Emerson formed the Nice with Lee Jackson, also of the T-Bones, David O'List, and Ian Hague, after soul singer P. P. Arnold asked him to form a backing band. After replacing Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on its own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and theatrical abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes as \\"symphonic rock\\". To increase the visual interest of his show, Emerson abused his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating it with a whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians. Emerson became well known for his work with the Nice. Outside of the group, he participated in the 1969 Music from Free Creek \\"supersession\\" project that included Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. For the session, Emerson performed with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Chuck Rainey covering, among other tunes, the Eddie Harris instrumental \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\". Emerson first heard a Moog when a record shop owner played Switched-On Bach for him. Emerson said, \\"My God that's incredible, what is that played on?\\" The owner then showed him the album cover. \\"So I said, 'What is that?' And he said, 'That's the Moog synthesizer.' My first impression was that it looked a bit like electronic skiffle.\\" Without one of his own, Emerson borrowed Mike Vickers' Moog for an upcoming Nice concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Vickers helped patch the Moog, and the concert was a success. Emerson's performance of \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\" (a composition most famous for its use in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey) was acclaimed. Emerson later explained, \\"I thought this was great. I've got to have one of these.\\" 1970‚Äì1979: Emerson, Lake & Palmer In 1970, Emerson left the Nice and formed Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP) with bassist Greg Lake from King Crimson and drummer Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster. After six months of focused rehearsal, the band played its first shows and recorded its first album, having quickly obtained a record deal with Atlantic Records. ELP became popular immediately after their 1970 Isle of Wight Festival performance, and continued to tour regularly throughout the 1970s. Not all were impressed, with BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel describing their Isle of Wight set as a \\"tragic waste of talent and electricity\\". Their set, with a half-million onlookers, involved \\"annihilating their instruments in a classical-rock blitz\\" and firing cannons from the stage. Recalling the gig in a 2002 interview, Emerson said: \\"We tried the cannons out on a field near Heathrow airport ... They seemed harmless enough. Today we would have been arrested as terrorists.\\" =Use of synthesizers in ELP= ELP's record deal provided funds for Emerson to buy his own Moog modular synthesizer. He later said, \\"It cost a lot of money and it arrived and I excitedly got it out of the box stuck it on the table and thought, 'Wow That's Great! a Moog synthesizer [pause] How do you switch it on?' ... There were all these leads and stuff, there was no instruction manual.\\" The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds, and these six became the foundation of ELP's sound. Emerson performing in concert with Emerson, Lake & Palmer in 1977 While other artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had used the Moog in studio recordings, Emerson was the first artist to tour with one. His use of the Moog was so critical to the development of new Moog models that he was given prototypes, such as the Constellation, which he took on one tour, and the Apollo, which had its d√©but on the opening track \\"Jerusalem\\" on the 1973 album Brain Salad Surgery. The Moog was a temperamental device; the oscillators went out of tune with temperature change. He later said, \\"I had my faithful roady Rocky tune the instrument to A 440 just prior to the audience coming in, but once the audience came into the auditorium and the temperature rose up then everything went out of tune.\\" His willingness to experiment with the Moog led to unexpected results, such as the time he stumbled into the signature sound for \\"Hoedown\\", one of ELP's most popular tunes. He later said, \\"We'd started working on that arrangement and then I hit, I don't know what, I switched a blue button and I put a patch cord in there, but anyway 'whoooeee'.\\" The so- called \\"Monster Moog\\", built from numerous modules, weighed , stood feet tall and took four roadies to move. Even with its unpredictability, it became an indispensable component of not only ELP's concerts, but also Emerson's own. \\"Mr. Emerson's towering, 10-foot-tall, 550-pound Monster Moog, as he called it, was an indispensable part of the group's concerts, even though it was often unreliable and difficult to play.\\" As synthesiser technology evolved, Emerson went on to use a variety of other synthesisers made by Moog and other companies, including the Minimoog, the Yamaha GX-1 used on ELP's Works Volume 1 album, and several models by Korg (see Instrumentation). =As composer and arranger= Emerson performed several notable rock arrangements of classical compositions, ranging from J. S. Bach and Modest Mussorgsky to 20th-century composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k, Aaron Copland, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek and Alberto Ginastera. Occasionally Emerson quoted from classical and jazz works without giving credit, particularly early in his career, from the late 1960s until 1972.Romano, p. PT42. An early example of Emerson's arranging was the song \\"Rondo\\" by the Nice, which is a 4/4 interpretation of Dave Brubeck's 9/8 composition \\"Blue Rondo √† la Turk\\". The piece is introduced by an extensive excerpt from the 3rd movement of Bach's Italian Concerto. On ELP's eponymous first album, Emerson's classical quotes went largely uncredited. Classical pianist Peter Donohoe has said that \\"The Barbarian\\" was an arrangement of \\"Allegro barbaro\\" by Bart√≥k, and that \\"Knife Edge\\" was based on the main theme of the opening movement of \\"Sinfonietta\\" by Jan√°ƒçek. By 1971, with the releases Pictures at an Exhibition and Trilogy, ELP began to fully credit classical composers, including Modest Mussorgsky for the piano piece which inspired the Pictures album, and Aaron Copland for \\"Hoedown\\" on the Trilogy album. Emerson indicated in an interview that he based his version of Pictures at an Exhibition on Mussorgsky's original piano composition, rather than on Maurice Ravel's later orchestration of the work. Following ELP's 1974 tour, the members agreed to put the band on temporary hiatus and pursue individual solo projects. During this time, Emerson composed his \\"Piano Concerto No. 1\\" and recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. According to Emerson, he was motivated by critical comments suggesting that he relied upon adapting classical works because he was unable to write his own music, and further motivated by the London Philharmonic \\"who weren't that helpful to begin with\\" and \\"had the attitude of 'What's a rock musician doing writing a piano concerto?'\\" Emerson said, \\"I wanted people to say, look, I'm a composer, I do write my own music, and what greater challenge than to write a piano concerto.\\" The recording later appeared on ELP's album Works Volume 1. Emerson's concerto has since been performed by classical pianists, most notably Jeffrey Biegel, who has performed it several times and recorded it with Emerson's permission. In 1976, while still in ELP, Emerson also released his first solo record, the single \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\" b/w \\"Barrelhouse Shake-Down\\". \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\", Emerson's cover of a 1927 boogie-woogie piano song by Meade Lux Lewis, reached on the UK Singles Chart. =Theatrics= Emerson in the mid-1980s In addition to his technical skills at playing and composing, Emerson was a theatrical performer. He cited guitarist Jimi Hendrix and organist Don Shinn as his chief theatrical influences. While in ELP, Emerson continued to some degree the physical abuse of his Hammond organ that he had developed with the Nice, including playing the organ upside down while having it lie over him and using knives to wedge down specific keys and sustain notes during solos. In addition to using his knives on the organ, he also engaged in knife throwing onstage, using a target fastened in front of his Leslie speakers. He was given his trademark knife, an authentic Nazi dagger, by Lemmy Kilmister, who was a roadie for the Nice in his earlier days. Over time, Emerson toned down his act with the organ in response to ELP's greater reliance on spectacular stage props. For example, during the Brain Salad Surgery tour, at the end of the show, a sequencer in Emerson's Moog Modular synthesiser was set running at an increasing rate, with the synthesiser pivoting to face the audience while emitting smoke and deploying a large pair of silver bat wings from its back.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 332. One of Emerson's memorable live show stunts with ELP involved playing a piano suspended 15 to 20 feet in mid-air and then rotated end-over- end with Emerson sitting at it. This was purely for visual effect, as according to Greg Lake, the piano was fake and had no works inside. In a 2014 interview with Classic Rock Music journalist Ray Shasho, Emerson was asked about the origin of the \\"flying piano\\" and about the difficulty of performing while spinning in the air. He explained: > \\"I think having a pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew > said we found this guy that used to work in the circus and he does a lot of > things for TV and special effects and he's made something that might > interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh > that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was > driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the > background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from > upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked > on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the > seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well > that's great! Then Bob asked me, do you want to have a go at it? ... Yea, > okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, > like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under > the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to > play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal > force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at > Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience > were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later > on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that > there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there > was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that > stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, > with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough > to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that > went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up > going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was > literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did > came the question ... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say > what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist > Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how > do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I > said, 'Dave, don't try it! The spinning piano was part of ELP's stage show only for a short time due to the complexity of the stunt and the number of injuries sustained by Emerson while performing it, including many finger injuries and a broken nose. Emerson wanted to use the spinning piano again at ELP's 2010 reunion concert at the High Voltage Festival in London, but was forbidden from using it by the local authority who said that the plans did not meet Health and Safety standards. 1979‚Äì1991: Solo and group projects After ELP disbanded in 1979, Emerson pursued a variety of projects during the 1980s and 1990s, including solo releases, soundtrack work and other bands, including supergroup the Best. In the early 1990s, Emerson rejoined the reunited ELP, but the group broke up again by the end of that decade. =Solo career= In 1981, Emerson released his debut solo album, Honky. Recorded in the Bahamas with local musicians, it departed from Emerson's usual style in featuring calypso and reggae songs, and was generally not well received, except in Italy where it was a hit. Emerson's subsequent solo releases were sporadic, including a Christmas album in 1988, and the album Changing States (also known as Cream of Emerson Soup) recorded in 1989 but not released until 1995, after several of its songs had already been re-recorded and released in different versions on ELP's 1992 comeback album Black Moon. Changing States also contained an orchestral remake of the ELP song \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\" with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and \\"The Church\\", which Emerson composed for the 1989 Michele Soavi horror film of the same name. =Soundtrack work= In the 1980s, Emerson began to write and perform music for films, as his orchestral and classical style was more suited for film work than for the new wave-dominated pop/ rock market. Films for which Emerson contributed soundtrack music include Dario Argento's Inferno (1980), the action thriller Nighthawks (1981) starring Sylvester Stallone, (1984 film) Best Revenge, notable because he collaborated with Brad Delp from the band Boston on this soundtrack, that also featured an instrumental piece called \\"Dream Runner\\" that became a standard solo performance piece for Emerson during at ELP shows throughout the next decade, Lucio Fulci's Murder Rock (1984), and Michele Soavi's The Church (also known as La chiesa) (1989). He was also the composer for the short-lived 1994 US animated television series Iron Man.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 699. =1980s and 1990s bands= Starting in the mid-1980s, Emerson formed several short-lived supergroups. The first two, Emerson, Lake & Powell (with Lake and ex-Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell) and 3 (with Palmer and American multi-instrumentalist Robert Berry), were intended to carry on in the general style of ELP in the absence of one of the original members. Emerson, Lake & Powell had some success, and their sole album is considered one of the best of both Emerson's and Lake's careers. Stylistically, it was a departure from their 1980s progressive rock peers, Genesis and Asia. Progressive rock analyst Edward Macan wrote that Emerson, Lake & Powell were closer to the \\"classic ELP sound\\" than ELP's own late-1970s output.Macan, Rocking the Classics, p. PT366 and . By contrast, 3's only album sold poorly and drew comparisons to \\"the worst moments of Love Beach\\" (which had been a commercial disaster for ELP). Emerson performing with ELP in 1992 Emerson also toured briefly in 1990 with The Best, a supergroup including John Entwistle of The Who, Joe Walsh of the Eagles, Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter of Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers, and Simon Phillips. This project focused on covering songs from each of the members' past bands.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 520. In the early 1990s, Emerson formed the short-lived group Aliens of Extraordinary Ability with Stuart Smith, Richie Onori, Marvin Sperling and Robbie Wyckoff. The group's name came from the application process for a US work visa, and the members included several British musicians who, like Emerson, had come to Los Angeles to further their careers. The group turned down a record deal with Samsung because of Emerson's commitment to an ELP reunion and Smith's involvement with a possible reformation of The Sweet. 1991‚Äì1998: Reunion with ELP In 1991, ELP reformed for two more albums (Black Moon (1992) and In the Hot Seat (1994)) and world tours in 1992‚Äì1993. After the 1993 tour, Emerson was forced to take a year off from playing due to a nerve condition affecting his right hand (see Health issues). Following his recovery, ELP resumed touring in 1996, including a successful US tour with Jethro Tull, but broke up again in August 1998. 1998‚Äì2016 Emerson with his \\"Monster Moog\\" synthesiser, May 2010 Emerson participated in the Nice's reunion tour and a 40th anniversary show for ELP, preceded by a short duo tour with Greg Lake. Apart from these reunions, he continued his solo career, releasing solo and soundtrack albums, touring with his own Keith Emerson Band, and making occasional guest appearances. Starting in 2010, he increasingly focused on orchestral collaborations. A documentary film based on his autobiography was reportedly in production at the time of his death in 2016. =Reunion shows= In 2002 Emerson reformed and toured with the Nice, though performing a longer set of ELP music using a backing band including guitarist/vocalist Dave Kilminster. During the spring of 2010, he toured with Greg Lake in the United States and Canada, doing a series of \\"Intimate Evening\\" duo shows in which they performed newly arranged versions of the music of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, the Nice, and King Crimson as well as Emerson's new original composition. On 25 July 2010, a one-off Emerson, Lake & Palmer reunion concert closed the High Voltage Festival as the main act in Victoria Park, East London, to commemorate the band's 40th anniversary. =Solo career and Keith Emerson Band= Emerson continued his solo and soundtrack work into the 2000s. His solo releases included the all-piano album Emerson Plays Emerson (2002), several compilations, and contributions to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin tribute albums (see Discography). He was also one of three composers who contributed to the soundtrack for the Japanese kaiju film Godzilla: Final Wars (2004). Following the August 2008 release of the album Keith Emerson Band Featuring Marc Bonilla, Emerson also toured with his own self-named band in Russia, the Baltic States and Japan between August and October 2008. The tour band members were Marc Bonilla, Travis Davis and Tony Pia. =Orchestral collaborations= Japanese composer Takashi Yoshimatsu worked with Emerson to create an arrangement of ELP's song \\"Tarkus\\", which premiered on 14 March 2010, performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. Yoshimatsu's arrangement has been featured in multiple live performances and two live recordings. In September 2011, Emerson began working with Norwegian conductor Terje Mikkelsen, along with the Keith Emerson Band featuring Marc Bonilla and the Munich Radio Orchestra, on new orchestral renditions of ELP classics and their new compositions. The project \\"The Three Fates\\" was premiered in Norway in early September 2012, supervised by Norwegian professor and musician Bj√∏rn Ole Rasch for the Norwegian Simax label. The work received its UK live premiere on 10 July 2015 at London's Barbican Centre, with the BBC Concert Orchestra, as part of the celebration of the life and work of Robert Moog. Emerson made his conducting debut with Orchestra Kentucky of Bowling Green, Kentucky in September 2013. In October 2014, Emerson conducted the South Shore Symphony at his 70th birthday tribute concert at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York. The concert also featured the premiere of his Three String Quartets, and a performance of Emerson's \\"Piano Concerto No. 1\\" by Jeffrey Biegel. =Other appearances and activities= In 2000, Emerson was a featured panelist and performer at \\"The Keyboard Meets Modern Technology\\", an event honouring Moog presented by the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with a gallery exhibition celebrating the 300th anniversary of the piano. Emerson later headlined both the first and third Moogfest, a festival held in honour of Robert Moog, at the B. B. King Blues Club & Grill at Times Square in New York City, in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Emerson opened the Led Zeppelin reunion/Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London on 10 December 2007, along with Chris Squire and Alan White (Yes) and Simon Kirke (Bad Company/Free). The supergroup played a new arrangement of \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\". Emerson also made a guest appearance in 2009 on Spinal Tap's album Back from the Dead, and played on several songs at Spinal Tap's \\"One Night Only World Tour\\" at Wembley Arena on 30 June 2009. In 2004 Emerson published his autobiography entitled Pictures of an Exhibitionist, which dealt with his life up to his nearly career-ending nerve-graft surgery in 1993. In 2007, Emerson began working with Canadian independent filmmaker Jason Woodford to make a documentary film based on his autobiography. As of March 2016, production was still ongoing and the filmmakers were seeking funding to finish the film, according to the webpage of an artists' management company representing Emerson. Personal life Emerson married his Danish girlfriend, Elinor, around Christmas 1969.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 42. They had two sons, Aaron and Damon,Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 355. but later divorced.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 571. He later had a long-term relationship with Mari Kawaguchi. Emerson enjoyed flying as a hobby, and he obtained his pilot's licence in 1972. When Emerson moved to Santa Monica, California, in the mid-1990s, John Lydon, who had openly and harshly criticized ELP during the 1970s when Lydon was a member of the punk band Sex Pistols, was Emerson's neighbour. The two became friends, with Lydon saying in a 2007 interview, \\"He's a great bloke\\". Health issues In 1993, Emerson was forced to take a year off from playing after he developed a nerve- related condition affecting his right hand that he likened to \\"writer's cramp\\" and that was also reported as a form of arthritis. According to Emerson, this coincided with his divorce, his Sussex home burning down, and financial difficulties. During his time off, he ran marathons, customised a Harley- Davidson motorcycle, and wrote film scores and his autobiography, Pictures of an Exhibitionist, which opens and closes with an account of his illness and subsequent arm operation. By 2002 he had regained full use of his hands and could play to his usual strength. In September 2010, Emerson released a message stating: \\"During a routine medical examination, a colonoscopy revealed a rather dangerous polyp in my lower colon. It is the conclusion of the doctors here in London that I must undergo surgery immediately. Unfortunately, the timing of this urgent surgery does not allow me to start touring in early October because of the required period of hospitalization and recuperation. I must remain optimistic that all will turn out well\\". Death Emerson's grave in Lancing, West Sussex Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His body was found at his Santa Monica home. Following an autopsy, the medical examiner ruled Emerson's death a suicide, and concluded that he had also suffered from heart disease and from depression associated with alcohol. According to Emerson's girlfriend Mari Kawaguchi, Emerson had become \\"depressed, nervous and anxious\\" because nerve damage had hampered his playing, and he was worried that he would perform poorly at upcoming concerts in Japan and disappoint his fans. Emerson was buried on 1 April 2016 at Lancing and Sompting Cemetery, Lancing, West Sussex. Although his death had been reported by news sources and an official Emerson, Lake and Palmer social media page as having occurred on the night of 10 March, his grave memorial gives his date of death as 11 March 2016. His former ELP bandmates, Carl Palmer and Greg Lake, both issued statements on his death. Palmer said, \\"Keith was a gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come.\\" Lake said, \\"As sad and tragic as Keith's death is, I would not want this to be the lasting memory people take away with them. What I will always remember about Keith Emerson was his remarkable talent as a musician and composer and his gift and passion to entertain. Music was his life and despite some of the difficulties he encountered I am sure that the music he created will live on forever.\\" Lake died later that same year. Playing style Emerson sometimes reached into the interior of his piano and hit, plucked, or strummed the strings with his hand. He said that as a keyboard player, he hated the idea of being \\"static\\" and that to avoid it, he \\"wanted to get inside the piano, brush the strings, stick Ping-Pong balls inside\\". \\"Take a Pebble\\" included Emerson strumming the strings of his piano as if he were playing an autoharp.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 114. In the Nice's 1968 live performance of \\"Hang on to a Dream\\" on the German television program Beat-Club (later released on DVD in 1997), Emerson can be seen and heard reaching inside his grand piano at one point and plucking its strings. In addition to such experimentation, Emerson also incorporated unique musical stylization into his work. Emerson is recognized for having integrated different sounds into his writing, utilizing methods of both horizontal and vertical contrast. Horizontal contrast is the use of distinct styles in a piece of music, combined by alternating between two different segments (in Emerson's case, most frequently alternating classical and non-classical); this technique can be seen in numerous works, such as \\"Rondo\\", \\"Tantalising Maggie\\", \\"The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack\\" and others. Vertical contrast is the combination of multiple styles simultaneously; Emerson frequently played a given style with one hand and a contrasting one with the other. This structure can be seen in works such as \\"Intermezzo from the Karelia Suite\\", \\"Rondo\\", and others. Emerson's love of modern music such as Copland and Bartok was evident in his open voicings and use of fifths and fourths, \\"Fanfare\\" emulating guitar power chords. He also used dissonance, atonality, sonata and fugue forms, exposing rock and roll audiences to a myriad of classical styles from Bach to Stravinsky. Instrumentation Emerson used a variety of electronic keyboard instruments during his career, including several Hammond organs and synthesisers by Moog Music, Yamaha, and Korg. From time to time he also used other instruments such as pipe organs, a grand piano, a clavinet, and very briefly, a Mellotron. During his ELP years, Emerson toured with a large amount of gear, taking thirteen keyboard units to a December 1973 show at Madison Square Garden, and later traveling with a large Yamaha GX-1 that required eight roadies to move it. Michael \\"Supe\\" Granda of The Ozark Mountain Daredevils recalled Emerson's organ rig as being \\"as large as [the Daredevils'] entire stage plot\\". Pre-ELP equipment and Hammond organs Initially a piano player, Emerson obtained his first Hammond organ, an L-100, after hearing jazz organist Jack McDuff and becoming frustrated with broken hammers inside pianos. Around 1968, during his time with the Nice, he added a second Hammond organ, the more expensive C-3, and placed the two organs sideways and facing each other so he could stand between the two keyboards and play both with his unobstructed body facing the audience. Emerson preferred the sound of the C-3 as being \\"far superior\\" to the cheaper L-100, and used the L100 to \\"throw around and make it feed back\\". Emerson got the L-100 to feed back by placing it close to the onstage speakers and using a fuzzbox. He continued to perform physical abuse stunts with the L-100 to some degree throughout his years with ELP. Throughout his career, Emerson owned a number of L-100 models in various states of repair to support his act. These organs were also specially reinforced and modified to enhance their sound and help prevent damage while on tour, and were reported to weigh 300 to 350 pounds. By contrast, his C-3 organ was not used for stunts and Emerson continued to play his original C-3 for many years, using it on all the ELP albums and tours throughout the 1970s. He also owned several other Hammond organ models in addition to the L-100s and the C-3. When Emerson sold much of his gear in the mid-1990s, his Hammond organs were among the items he kept as being \\"too personal to let go\\". The remains of one L-100 that failed and burned during a 1990s ELP show in Boston were donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ELP equipment and Moog synthesisers Emerson with the Moog synthesizer (c.1977) With ELP, Emerson added the Moog synthesiser behind the C-3 with the keyboard and ribbon controller stacked on the top of the organ. The ribbon controller allowed Emerson to vary pitch, volume or timbre of the output from the Moog by moving his finger up and down the length of a touch-sensitive strip. It also could be used as a phallic symbol, and outfitted with a small rocket launcher, it quickly became a feature of the act. He continued to divide his keyboard setup into two banks so that he could play between them with his body in view. When the ultra-compact Moog Minimoog first appeared it was placed where needed, such as on top of the grand piano. A Hohner clavinet L, with reversed black and white keys, was also part of Emerson's keyboard rig. Although it could be heard on numerous album pieces, according to Emerson, it was only used for one song, \\"Nut Rocker\\" in concert. During the Brain Salad Surgery tour of 1974, Emerson's keyboard setup included the Hammond C-3 organ, run through multiple Leslie speakers driven by HiWatt guitar amplifiers, the Moog 3C modular synthesiser (modified by addition of various modules and an oscilloscope) with ribbon controller, a Steinway concert grand piano with a Minimoog synthesiser on top of it, an upright acoustic-electric piano that was used for honky-tonk piano sounds, a Hohner Clavinet and another Minimoog synthesiser. Emerson also used a prototype polyphonic synthesiser produced by Moog, which was the test bed for the Moog Polymoog polyphonic synthesiser. The original synthesiser setup as envisioned by Moog was called the Constellation, and consisted of three instruments ‚Äì the polyphonic synthesiser, called the Apollo, a monophonic lead synthesiser called the Lyra, and a bass-pedal synthesiser, called the Taurus, but Emerson never used the Taurus. Pipe organs Occasionally Emerson used a pipe organ, when available, in live performances and on recordings. He played the Royal Albert Hall Organ at a show with the Nice on 26 June 1968, where the band controversially burned a painting of an American flag onstage to protest against the Vietnam War.Emerson, Pictures, p. 102‚Äì103. The stunt caused a storm of objections in the US and the Nice received a lifetime ban from the venue. With ELP, Emerson used the Royal Festival Hall organ for the \\"Clotho\\" segment of \\"The Three Fates\\" on the 1970 eponymous debut album by ELP.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 119. He played this organ again in 2002 to open a Nice reunion tour show, but according to a reviewer, the organ failed to operate at the expected volume. The Newcastle City Hall organ was used for the introductory section of Pictures at an Exhibition, recorded there live on 26 March 1971. Emerson was recorded playing the organ at St. Mark's Church in London for \\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\" on the 1971 ELP album Tarkus.Romano, p. PT134. Yamaha GX-1 synthesisers After founder Robert Moog left Moog Music in the late 1970s, Emerson began to consider using synthesisers made by other companies. Emerson became one of the few buyers of the Yamaha GX-1 polyphonic synthesiser, which reportedly cost almost $50,000. The GX-1 was subsequently used on the ELP album Works Volume 1, particularly on the song \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", and on tour. It can be seen in ELP's Works Orchestral Tour video and in promotional photos and videos from 1977 featuring the band playing \\"Fanfare\\" outdoors during a snowstorm in Montreal's Olympic Stadium.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 385. Emerson later bought a second GX-1 from John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, and used parts from it to repair his original GX-1, which was damaged by a tractor crashing into Emerson's home studio. Emerson sold much of his keyboard equipment in the 1990s when he relocated from England to Santa Monica, California. The John Paul Jones GX-1 was sold to film composer Hans Zimmer, while Emerson's original GX-1 was sold to Italian keyboardist Riccardo Grotto. Korg synthesisers In the late 1970s, Emerson also began to use the Korg PS-3300 and PS-3100, which at the time were among the world's first fully polyphonic synthesizers. These Korgs appeared on the ELP album Love Beach, and Emerson continued to use them into the 1980s for his solo album Honky and his soundtrack work. He also became an official endorser for the PS-3300 and PS-3100 in the early 1980s. By the late 2000s, Emerson was employing \\"a host of Korg gear\\" including the Korg OASYS and Korg Triton Extreme music workstation synthesisers. A review of the DVD release of ELP's 2010 one-off reunion show said that the Korg OASYS \\"appear[ed] to be Emerson's go-to instrument\\", although he also used a Hammond C-3 and a Moog with ribbon controller onstage. Honours and awards In December 1980 Contemporary Keyboard magazine announced, in their Fifth Annual Readers' Poll, that Emerson had‚Äîfor the fifth time in a row‚Äîcaptured first place in two categories - '\\"Overall Best Keyboardist\\" and \\"Best Multi-Keyboardist\\". The five-time wins put Emerson in their \\"Gallery Of The Greats\\" for both categories. The same poll also saw Emerson take \\"Best Rock Organist\\" for the fourth time and \\"Best Lead Synthesist\\". In March 2010 Emerson received the annual Frankfurt Music Prize for his achievements, awarded in Frankfurt on the eve of the annual Musikmesse fair. In September 2013 Orchestra Kentucky of Bowling Green gave Emerson their Lifetime Achievement Award in the Arts and Humanities \\"for his role in bringing classical music to the masses\\". In 2014 Emerson was inducted into the Hammond Hall of Fame by the Hammond Organ Company.

Permission to use pieces was sometimes denied by the composer or his family; for example Gustav Holst's daughter refused to grant official permission for rock bands to perform her late father's composition Mars, the Bringer of War. However, a number of composers did grant permission for their works to be used. Aaron Copland said that there was \\"something that attracted [him]\\" about ELP's version of \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", and so approved its use, although he said, \\"What they do in the middle (i.e., the modal section between repeats of Copland's theme), I'm not sure exactly how they connect that with my music\\". Alberto Ginastera, on the other hand, enthusiastically approved Emerson's electronic realisation of the fourth movement of his first piano concerto, which appeared on their album Brain Salad Surgery under the title \\"Toccata\\". Ginastera said, \\"You have captured the essence of my music, and no one's ever done that before.\\" With the Nice * \\"America, 2nd Amendment\\", from West Side Story's \\"America\\", by Leonard Bernstein, credited, quoting Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's Symphony No. 9, From the New World, uncredited.Macan, Endless Enigma, p. 22. * \\"Rondo\\", derived from Dave Brubeck's \\"Blue Rondo √† la Turk\\", uncredited, quoting Bach, Italian Concerto third movement, uncredited. * \\"Diary of an Empty Day\\", from Symphonie Espagnole by √âdouard Lalo, credited. * \\"Azrael Revisited\\", quoting Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, credited. * \\"Ars Longa Vita Brevis\\" ‚Äì Bach, the third Brandenburg Concerto, Allegro, credited. * \\"Intermezzo from the Karelia Suite\\" ‚Äì Sibelius, credited. * \\"Pathetique\\", third movement from Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, credited. * \\"Hang on to a Dream\\", from \\"How Can We Hang On to a Dream?\\" by Tim Hardin, credited, quoting (during a live recording) \\"Summertime\\", from Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin, uncredited. * \\"She Belongs to Me\\", by Bob Dylan, credited, quoting Bach, uncredited,Duxbury, p. 162. and fragments of the theme from The Magnificent Seven, by Elmer Bernstein, uncredited. * \\"Country Pie\\", by Bob Dylan, credited, lyrics partly set to Bach, the sixth Brandenburg Concerto, credited.

David Bushnell. New York: Oxford University Press 2003. or the Liberator, was a Venezuelan military and political leader who led what are currently the countries of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama to independence from the Spanish Empire. Bol√≠var was born into a wealthy family and as was common for the heirs of upper-class families in his day, was sent to be educated abroad at a young age, arriving in Spain when he was 16 and later moving to France. While in Europe he was introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment, which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning Spanish in colonial South America. Taking advantage of the disorder in Spain prompted by the Peninsular War, Bol√≠var began his campaign for independence in 1808. The campaign for the independence of New Granada was consolidated with the victory at the Battle of Boyac√° on 7 August 1819. He established an organized national congress within three years. Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the patriot victory at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country. Following this triumph over the Spanish monarchy, Bol√≠var participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Latin America, Gran Colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Through further military campaigns, he ousted Spanish rulers from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the last of which was named after him. He was simultaneously president of Gran Colombia (present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador), Peru, and Bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, was appointed president of Bolivia. Bol√≠var aimed at a strong and united Spanish America able to cope not only with the threats emanating from Spain and the European Holy Alliance but also with the emerging power of the United States. At the peak of his power, Bol√≠var ruled over a vast territory from the Argentine border to the Caribbean Sea. Bol√≠var fought 100 battles, of which 79 were important ones, and during his campaigns rode on horseback 70,000 kilometers, which is 10 times more than Hannibal, three times more than Napoleon, and twice as much as Alexander the Great.Toro Hardy, Alfredo, Understanding Latin America (2017), World Scientific, New Jersey, p. 47 Bol√≠var is viewed as a national icon in much of modern South America, and is considered one of the great heroes of the Hispanic independence movements of the early 19th century, along with Jos√© Miguel Carrera, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Francisco de Miranda and others. Towards the end of his life, Bol√≠var despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote \\"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\\". In an address to the Constituent Congress of the Republic of Colombia, Bol√≠var stated \\"Fellow citizens! I blush to say this: Independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest.\\"quoted in Jeremy Adelman, \\"Independence in Latin America\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, Jos√© C. Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 153. Family history Origin of Bol√≠var surname The Birthplace of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Caracas, Venezuela (now a museum) An 18th-century portrait of Bol√≠var's father, Juan Vicente Bol√≠var y Ponte The surname Bol√≠var originated with aristocrats from La Puebla de Bol√≠var, a small village in the Basque Country of Spain. Bol√≠var's father came from the female line of the Ardanza family. His maternal grandmother was descended from families from the Canary Islands. 16th century The Bol√≠vars settled in Venezuela in the 16th century. Bol√≠var's first South American ancestor was Sim√≥n de Bol√≠var (or Simon de Bolibar; the spelling was not standardized until the 19th century), who lived and worked from 1559 to 1560 in Santo Domingo (present-day Dominican Republic) where his son Sim√≥n de Bol√≠var y Castro was born. When the governor was reassigned to Venezuela by the Spanish Crown in 1569, Sim√≥n de Bol√≠var went with him. As an early settler in Spain's Venezuela Province he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted estates, encomiendas, and positions in the local cabildo. When Caracas Cathedral was built in 1569, the Bol√≠var family had one of the first dedicated side chapels. The majority of the wealth of Sim√≥n de Bol√≠var's descendants came from their estates. The most important was a sugar plantation with an encomienda that provided the labor needed to run the estate. Another portion of the Bol√≠vars' wealth came from silver, gold, and copper mines. Small gold deposits were first mined in Venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits. From his mother's side (the Palacios family), Bol√≠var inherited the Aroa copper mines at Cocorote. Native American and African slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines. 17th century Toward the end of the 17th century, copper mining became so prominent in Venezuela that the metal became known as cobre Caracas (\\"Caracas copper\\"). Many of the mines became the property of the Bol√≠var family. Bol√≠var's grandfather, Juan de Bol√≠var y Mart√≠nez de Villegas, paid 22,000 ducats to the monastery at Santa Maria de Montserrat in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by King Philip V of Spain for its maintenance. The crown never issued the patent of nobility, and so the purchase became the subject of lawsuits that were still in progress during Bol√≠var's lifetime, when independence from Spain made the point moot. (If the lawsuits had been successful, Bol√≠var's older brother, Juan Vicente, would have become the Marquess of San Luis and Viscount of Cocorote.) Bol√≠var ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution. Having been one of the wealthiest persons within the Spanish American world at the beginning of the revolution, he died in poverty. Early life Childhood Sim√≥n Bol√≠var at the age of 17, in 1801 Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was born in a house in Caracas, Captaincy General of Venezuela, on 24 July 1783.Arana, M., 2013, Bolivar, New York: Simon & Schuster, He was baptized as Sim√≥n Jos√© Antonio de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Bol√≠var y Palacios. His mother was Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n Palacios y Blanco, and his father was Colonel Don Juan Vicente Bol√≠var y Ponte. He had two older sisters and a brother: Mar√≠a Antonia, Juana, and Juan Vicente. Another sister, Mar√≠a del Carmen, died at birth. When Bol√≠var was an infant, he was cared for by Do√±a Ines Manceba de Miyares and the family's slave, Hip√≥lita. A couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life. His father died before Bol√≠var's third birthday to tuberculosis, and his mother died when he was almost nine. After his mother's death, Bol√≠var was placed in the custody of an instructor, Miguel Jos√© Sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home. He went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors Andr√©s Bello, Guillermo Pelgr√≥n, Jose Antonio Negrete, Fernando Vides, Father And√∫jar, and Don Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez, formerly known as Sim√≥n Carre√±o. Don Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez became Bol√≠var's teacher, friend and mentor. He taught him how to swim and ride horses, as well as about liberty, human rights, politics, history, and sociology. Later in life, Rodr√≠guez was pivotal in Bol√≠var's decision to start the revolution, instilling in him the ideas of liberty, enlightenment, and freedom. In the meantime, Bol√≠var was mostly cared for by his nurse, his slave Hip√≥lita, whom he later called \\"the only mother I have known\\". Youth 1804 painting of Bol√≠var at age 20. When Bol√≠var was fourteen, Don Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez was forced to leave the country after being accused of involvement in a conspiracy against the Spanish government in Caracas. Bol√≠var then entered the military academy of the Milicias de Aragua. In 1800, he was sent to Spain to follow his military studies in Madrid, where he remained until 1802. Back in Europe in 1804, he lived in France and traveled to different countries. While in Milan, Bol√≠var witnessed the coronation of Napoleon as King of Italy (a kingdom in personal union with France in modern northern Italy), an event that left a profound impression on him. Even if he disagreed with the crowning, he was highly sensitive to the popular veneration inspired by the hero. Political and military career Venezuela and New Granada, 1807‚Äì1821 =Prelude, 1807‚Äì1810= Bol√≠var in 1812 Bol√≠var returned to Venezuela in 1807. After a coup on 19 April 1810, Venezuela achieved de facto independence when the Supreme Junta of Caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Supreme Junta sent a delegation to Great Britain to get British recognition and aid. This delegation presided by Bol√≠var also included two future Venezuelan notables Andr√©s Bello and Luis L√≥pez M√©ndez. The trio met with Francisco de Miranda and persuaded him to return to his native land. =First Republic of Venezuela, 1811‚Äì1812= In 1811, a delegation from the Supreme Junta, also including Bol√≠var, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received Miranda in La Guaira.Crow (1992:431). During the insurgence war conducted by Miranda, Bol√≠var was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of Puerto Cabello the following year, 1812. As Royalist Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde was advancing into republican territory from the west, Bol√≠var lost control of San Felipe Castle along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Bol√≠var then retreated to his estate in San Mateo. Miranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with Monteverde on 25 July, an action that Bol√≠var and other revolutionary officers deemed treasonous. In one of Bol√≠var's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army at the port of La Guaira.Masur (1969), 98‚Äì102; and Lynch, Bol√≠var: A Life, 60‚Äì63. For his apparent services to the Royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol√≠var a passport, and Bol√≠var left for Cura√ßao on 27 August. It must be said, though, that Bol√≠var protested to the Spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled Miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the Crown but punishing a defector. In 1813, he was given a military command in Tunja, New Granada (modern-day Colombia), under the direction of the Congress of United Provinces of New Granada, which had formed out of the juntas established in 1810. =Second Republic of Venezuela (1813‚Äì1814) and exile= Bol√≠var in 1816, during his stay in Haiti This was the beginning of the Admirable Campaign. On 24 May, Bol√≠var entered M√©rida, where he was proclaimed El Libertador (\\"The Liberator\\"). This was followed by the occupation of Trujillo on 9 June. Six days later, and as a result of Spanish massacres on independence supporters, Bol√≠var dictated his famous \\"Decree of War to the Death\\", allowing the killing of any Spaniard not actively supporting independence. Caracas was retaken on 6 August 1813, and Bol√≠var was ratified as El Libertador, establishing the Second Republic of Venezuela. The following year, because of the rebellion of Jos√© Tom√°s Boves and the fall of the republic, Bol√≠var returned to New Granada, where he commanded a force for the United Provinces. His forces entered Bogot√° in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of Cundinamarca. Bol√≠var intended to march into Cartagena and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the Royalist town of Santa Marta. In 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of Cartagena, Bol√≠var fled to Jamaica, where he was denied support. After an assassination attempt in Jamaica,Sim√≥n Bol√≠var has been indirectly saved by his French friend Beno√Æt Chass√©riau who 10 December 1815 a few hours before the assassination attempt, visited him and gave him money to seek alternative accommodation. Thus, the Liberator left the room where Jos√© Antonio P√°ez had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged his murderous knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.

( he fled to Haiti, where he was granted protection. He befriended Alexandre P√©tion, the president of the recently independent southern republic (as opposed to the Kingdom of Haiti in the north), and petitioned him for aid. He provided the South American leader with a multitude of provisions consisting of ships, men and weapons; only demanding in return that Bol√≠var promise to abolish slavery in any of the lands he took back from Spain. The pledge would indeed be upheld, and the abolition of slavery in the liberated territories would be regarded as one Bol√≠var's main achievements. =Campaigns in Venezuela, 1816‚Äì1818= In 1816, with Haitian soldiers and vital material support, Bol√≠var landed in Venezuela and fulfilled his promise to P√©tion to free Spanish America's slaves on 2 June 1816. The Expedition of the Keys was led by Bolivar and fought for Venezuela in the east, while the Guyana Campaign started in the west and was led by Manuel Piar. In July 1817, on a second expedition, he captured Angostura after defeating the counter-attack of Miguel de la Torre. However, Venezuela remained a captaincy of Spain after the victory in 1818 by Pablo Morillo in the Second Battle of La Puerta (es). After capturing Angostura, and an unexpected victory in New Granada, Bolivar set up a temporary government in Venezuela. This was the start of the Third Republic of Venezuela. With this Bolivar created the Congress of Angostura which following the wars would establish Gran Colombia, a state which includes today's territories of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela. To honor Bolivar's efforts to help Venezuela during its independence movement, the city of Angostura was renamed to Ciudad Bolivar in 1846. =Liberation of New Granada and Venezuela, 1819‚Äì1821= Bol√≠var and Francisco de Paula Santander during the Congress of C√∫cuta, October 1821 On 15 February 1819, Bol√≠var was able to open the Venezuelan Second National Congress in Angostura, in which he was elected president and Francisco Antonio Zea was elected vice president. Bol√≠var then decided that he would first fight for the independence of New Granada, to gain resources of the viceroyalty, intending later to consolidate the independence of Venezuela.Batallas de Venezuela: 1810‚Äì1824. p. 124. Edgar Esteves Gonz√°lez The campaign for the independence of New Granada, which included the crossing of the Andes mountain range, one of history's great military feats, was consolidated with the victory at the Battle of Boyac√° on 7 August 1819. Bol√≠var returned to Angostura, when congress passed a law forming a greater Republic of Colombia on 17 December, making Bol√≠var president and Zea vice president, with Francisco de Paula Santander vice president on the New Granada side, and Juan Germ√°n Roscio vice president on the Venezuela side. Battle of Carabobo, 24 June 1821 Morillo was left in control of Caracas and the coastal highlands. After the restoration of the C√°diz Constitution, Morillo ratified two treaties with Bol√≠var on 25 November 1820, calling for a six-month armistice and recognizing Bol√≠var as president of the republic. Bol√≠var and Morillo met in San Fernando de Apure on 27 November, after which Morillo left Venezuela for Spain, leaving La Torre in command. From his newly consolidated base of power, Bol√≠var launched outright independence campaigns in Venezuela and Ecuador. These campaigns concluded with the victory at the Battle of Carabobo, after which Bol√≠var triumphantly entered Caracas on 29 June 1821. On 7 September 1821, Gran Colombia (a state covering much of modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela) was created, with Bol√≠var as president and Santander as vice president. Ecuador and Peru, 1822‚Äì1824 Bol√≠var followed with the Battle of Bombona and the Battle of Pichincha, after which he entered Quito on 16 June 1822. On 26 and 27 July 1822, Bol√≠var held the Guayaquil Conference with the Argentine General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who had received the title of \\"Protector of Peruvian Freedom\\" in August 1821 after partially liberating Peru from the Spanish. Thereafter, Bol√≠var took over the task of fully liberating Peru. Battle of Jun√≠n, 6 August 1824 The Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru on 10 February 1824, which allowed Bol√≠var to reorganize completely the political and military administration. Assisted by Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Bol√≠var decisively defeated the Spanish cavalry at the Battle of Jun√≠n on 6 August 1824. Sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the Spanish forces at Ayacucho on 9 December 1824. According to British historian Robert Harvey: Writing to United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in 1824, United States Consul in Peru William Tudor stated: Even though Bol√≠var condemned the corrupt practices of the Spanish, he ordered some churches stripped of their decorations.Rumazo Gonz√°lez (2006), p. 151. On 19 March 1824, Jos√© Gabriel P√©rez wrote to Antonio Jos√© de Sucre about the orders given to him by Bol√≠var;Letter from Jos√© Gabriel P√©rez to Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Trujillo, 19 March 1824. Archivo del Libertador, Document 9135. P√©rez talked about \\"all the ordinary and extraordinary means\\" that should be applied to assure the subsistence of the patriot army. Indeed, P√©rez said that Bol√≠var issued instructions to take from churches \\"all golden and silver jewels\\" in order to coin them and pay war expenditures. Days later, Bol√≠var himself said to Sucre that there would be a complete lack of resources unless severe actions were taken against \\"the jewels of the churches, everywhere\\".Letter from Sim√≥n Bol√≠var to Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Trujillo, 21 March 1824. Archivo del Libertador, Document 9151. Consolidation of independence, 1825‚Äì1830 =Republic of Bolivia= On 6 August 1825, at the Congress of Upper Peru, the \\"Republic of Bolivia\\" was created. Bol√≠var is thus one of the few people to have a country named after him. Bol√≠var returned to Caracas on 12 January 1827, and then back to Bogot√°. Bol√≠var had great difficulties maintaining control of the vast Gran Colombia. In 1826, internal divisions sparked dissent throughout the nation, and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela. The new South American union had revealed its fragility and appeared to be on the verge of collapse. To preserve the union, an amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but this increased the political dissent in neighboring New Granada. In an attempt to keep the nation together as a single entity, Bol√≠var called for a constitutional convention at Oca√±a in March 1828. =Struggles inside Gran Colombia= El Libertador (Bol√≠var diplom√°tico), 1860. Oil on canvas 107 √ó 69 by Aita (pseudonym of Rita Matilde de la Pe√±uela, 1840-?), Located in the art collection of the Central Bank of Venezuela. Bol√≠var thought that a federation like the one founded in the United States was unworkable in the Spanish America. For this reason, and to prevent a break-up, Bol√≠var sought to implement a more centralist model of government in Gran Colombia, including some or all of the elements of the Bolivian constitution he had written, which included a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor (although this presidency was to be held in check by an intricate system of balances). This move was considered controversial in New Granada and was one of the reasons for the deliberations, which met from 9 April to 10 June 1828. The convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration. The federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline. Unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-Bol√≠var delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.Bushnell, David (1954) The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia Two months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, Bol√≠var was declared president-liberator in Colombia's \\"Organic Decree\\". He considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. An assassination attempt on 25 September 1828 failed (in Spanish it is indeed known as the Noche Septembrina), thanks to the help of his lover, Manuela S√°enz. Bol√≠var afterward described Manuela as \\"Liberatrix of the Liberator\\". Dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the next two years. Bolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the \\"Santander\\" faction. Eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established. Santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with Bolivar, was condemned to death. Bolivar, though, commuted the sentence. After the facts, Bolivar continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes. Uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the following two years. The separatists accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship. Gran Colombia declared war against Peru when president General La Mar invaded Guayaquil. He was later defeated by Marshall Antonio Jos√© de Sucre in the Battle of the Portete de Tarqui, 27 February 1829. Sucre was killed on 4 June 1830. General Juan Jos√© Flores wanted to separate the southern departments (Quito, Guayaquil, and Azuay), known as the District of Ecuador, from Gran Colombia to form an independent country and become its first President. Venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 January 1830 and Jos√© Antonio P√°ez maintained the presidency of that country, banishing Bolivar. =Dissolution of Gran Colombia= For Bol√≠var, South America was the fatherland. He dreamed of a united Spanish America and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created Gran Colombia but also the Confederation of the Andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated South American countries together. Nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards in all directions. On 20 January 1830, as his dream fell apart, Bol√≠var delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of Gran Colombia. In his speech, a distraught Bol√≠var urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation. (At the time, \\"Colombians\\" referred to the people of Gran Colombia (Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador), not modern-day Colombia): Bol√≠var ultimately failed in his attempt to prevent the collapse of the union. Gran Colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador. Ironically, these countries were established as centralist nations, and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during Bol√≠var's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship. These separatists, among them Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and Francisco de Paula Santander, had justified their opposition to Bol√≠var for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch. Some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against Bol√≠var's life (Santander, who governed the second centralist government of New Granada, was associated with the ). Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando, the first President of the Republic of New Granada (that succeeded the Gran Colombia), had been directly linked to the assassination of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre in 1830. Sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the Battle of Ayacucho, ending the war against the Spanish Empire in South America. Bol√≠var also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of Gran Colombia after Francisco de Paula Santander was exiled in 1828.Harvey, Robert. \\"Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America\\". Skyhorse, 2013, Ch. 24 \\"Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America\\" =Aftermath= For the rest of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the political environment of Latin America was fraught with civil wars and characterized by a sociopolitical phenomenon known as caudillismo, which became very common in Venezuela, especially after 1830. Indeed, such struggles already existed shortly after the patriot victory over the loyalists because the former Spanish colonies created new nations that proclaimed their own autonomous states, which produced military confrontations with political conspirations that sent some of the former independence heroes into exile. Moreover, there were attempts by the Spanish monarchy to reconquer their former settlements in the Americas through expeditions that would help the remaining loyalist forces and advocates. However, the attempts generally failed in Venezuela, Per√∫ and Mexico; thus, the loyalist resistance forces against the republic were finally defeated. The main characteristic of caudillismo was the arrival of authoritarian but charismatic political figures who would typically rise to power in an unconventional way, often legitimizing their right to govern through undemocratic processes. These caudillos maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses. On his deathbed, Bol√≠var envisaged the emergence of countless caudillos competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about. Final months and death Bol√≠var's death, by Venezuelan painter 225x225px Saying that \\"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\\", Bol√≠var finally resigned the presidency on 27 April 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in Europe. He had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to Europe, but he died before setting sail from Cartagena.225x225px It is said that before Sim√≥n Bol√≠var had passed away, he had declared that \\"America is ungovernable.\\" Bol√≠var was a man who had seen the negative in things. This negativity had grown from the distances that had separated the large continent or from the differences in the cultures, languages, ethnicities and the races of the people. Another factor could have been from the lack of political unity, but it is unclear what had led him to being pessimistic. These factors had caused Bol√≠var to put his hope on hold of uniting the sovereign territory. Old colonial cities had been separated and new trading centers had been separated by great geographical features such as mountains, high deserts and arid plains. These were all factors in which played a role and were responsible for the broken states during a time where wars of independence had risen. On 17 December 1830, at the age of 47, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var died of tuberculosis in the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino in Santa Marta, Gran Colombia (now Colombia). On his deathbed, Bol√≠var asked his aide-de-camp, General Daniel F. O'Leary, to burn the remaining extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches. O'Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a wealth of information about Bol√≠var's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his long love affair with Manuela S√°enz. Shortly before her own death in 1856, S√°enz augmented this collection by giving O'Leary her own letters from Bol√≠var. The transfer of Bol√≠var's remains from Santa Marta to Caracas Bol√≠var's remains were buried in the cathedral of Santa Marta. Twelve years later, in 1842, at the request of President Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, they were moved from Santa Marta to Caracas, where they were buried in the cathedral of Caracas together with the remains of his wife and parents. In 1876, he was moved to a monument set up for his interment at the National Pantheon of Venezuela. The Quinta near Santa Marta has been preserved as a museum with numerous references to his life. In 2010, symbolic remains of Bol√≠var's later-years lover, Manuela S√°enz, were also interred in Venezuela's National Pantheon. In January 2008, then-President of Venezuela Hugo Ch√°vez set up a commission to investigate theories that Bol√≠var was the victim of an assassination. On several occasions, Ch√°vez has claimed that Bol√≠var was in fact poisoned by \\"New Granada traitors\\". In April 2010, infectious diseases specialist Paul Auwaerter studied records of Bol√≠var's symptoms and concluded that he might have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning, but that both acute poisoning and murder were unlikely. In July 2010, Bol√≠var's body was ordered to be exhumed to advance the investigations. In July 2011, international forensics experts released their report, claiming there was no proof of poisoning or any other unnatural cause of death. Private life Marriage Bol√≠var marries Mar√≠a Teresa del Toro in 1802. In 1799, following the early deaths of his father Juan Vicente (dead since 1786) and his mother Concepci√≥n (who died in 1792), Bol√≠var traveled to Mexico, France, and Spain, at the age of 16 years, to complete his education. While in Madrid during 1802 and after a two-year courtship, he married Mar√≠a Teresa Rodr√≠guez del Toro y Alaiza, who was to be his only wife. She was related to the aristocratic families of the marquis del Toro of Caracas and the marquis de Inicio of Madrid. Eight months after returning to Venezuela with him, she died from yellow fever on 22 January 1803. Bol√≠var was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life. He swore never to marry again, a promise he kept. Many years later Bol√≠var would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life. Indeed, in 1828, he told Luis Per√∫ de Lacroix the following words: Not surprisingly, Spanish historian Salvador de Madariaga refers to the death of Bolivar's wife as one of the key moments in Hispanic America's history. In 1804, he traveled again to Europe in an attempt to ease his pain and began falling into a dissolute life. It was then that he met again with his old teacher Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez in Paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of Venezuela. He lived in Napoleonic France for a while and undertook the Grand Tour. During this time in Europe, Bol√≠var met the intellectual explorer, Alexander von Humboldt in Rome. Humboldt later wrote: \\"I was wrong back then, when I judged him a puerile man, incapable of realizing so grand an ambition.\\" Affairs and lovers Manuela S√°enz, lover of Bol√≠var who rescued him from an assassination attempt Bol√≠var had several love affairs. Most of them were ephemeral and did not last long. Historians, scholars and biographers often agree with the names of the most prominent women who stood with Bol√≠var, such as Josefina \\"Pepita\\" Machado, Fanny du Villars and Manuela S√°enz. Manuela S√°enz was the most important of those women. She was more than a lover in Bol√≠var's later life; she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor. Moreover, Manuela saved Bol√≠var's life during the September Conspiracy of 1828 in which Bol√≠var was about to be killed. During this assassination attempt, Manuela diverted the assassins and thus gave Bol√≠var enough time to escape from his room. Bol√≠var and Manuela met in Quito on 22 June 1822 and they began a long-term affair. The relationship was controversial at the time, because Manuela was already married to James Thorne, but they became estranged in 1822 due to irreconcilable differences.Masur (1948), pp. 430‚Äì33. The emotional ties between Manuela and Bol√≠var were strong, and Manuela attempted suicide when she received the news of Bol√≠var's death. Despite sometimes living in the same South American cities (such as Bogot√°, Quito and Lima), Bol√≠var and Manuela did not always have a face-to-face relationship. This romance was clear in their letters, but few of them have survived. Most of her letters were destroyed after Manuela's death.Rumazo Gonz√°lez (2007), p. 237. Contrary to the arguments exposed by Heinz Dieterich, Carlos √Ålvarez Sa√°, and a book edited by Fundaci√≥n Editorial El Perro y la Rana publishing house in 2007, several letters attributed to both Bol√≠var and Manuela are intentional forgeries. Descriptions of Bol√≠var Ducoudray Holstein In his Memoirs of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein (who himself has been called a \\"not-always-reliable and never impartial witness\\"Slatta, Richard W. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's Quest for Glory. Texas A&M; University Press, 2003. Print.) described the young Bol√≠var as he was attempting to seize power in Venezuela and New Granada in 1814‚Äì1816. Ducoudray Holstein joined Bol√≠var and served on his staff as an officer during this period. He describes Bol√≠var as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations. He would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for Margarita Island during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship. According to Ducoudray Holstein, Bol√≠var behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight. He was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety. In the Diario de Bucaramanga, Bol√≠var's opinion of Ducoudray is presented when Louis Peru de Lacroix asked who had been Bol√≠var's aides-de-camp since he had been general; he mentioned Charles Eloi Demarquet and Ducoudray. Bol√≠var confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his General Staff, but \\"I never trusted him enough to make him my aide-de-camp; to the contrary, I had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services\\", and that Ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a \\"real pleasure.\\" Relatives Bol√≠var had no children, possibly because of infertility caused by having contracted measles and mumps as a child. His closest living relatives descend from his sisters and brother. One of his sisters died in infancy. His sister Juana Bol√≠var y Palacios married their maternal uncle, Dionisio Palacios y Blanco, and had two children, Guillermo and Benigna. Guillermo Palacios died fighting alongside his uncle Sim√≥n in the battle of La Hogaza on 2 December 1817. Benigna had two marriages, the first to Pedro Brice√±o M√©ndez and the second to Pedro Amestoy. Their great-grandchildren, Bol√≠var's closest living relatives, Pedro, and Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa lived in Caracas as of 2009. His eldest sister, Mar√≠a Antonia, married Pablo Clemente Francia and had four children: Josefa, Anacleto, Valentina, and Pablo. Mar√≠a Antonia became Bol√≠var's agent to deal with his properties while he served as president of Gran Colombia and she was an executrix of his will. She retired to Bol√≠var's estate in Macarao, which she inherited from him. His older brother, Juan Vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the United States, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: Juan, Fernando Sim√≥n, and Felicia Bol√≠var Tinoco. Bol√≠var provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death. Bol√≠var was especially close to Fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the United States, where he attended the University of Virginia. In his long life, Fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of Venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout Europe. He had three children, Benjam√≠n Bol√≠var Gauthier, Santiago Hern√°ndez Bol√≠var, and Claudio Bol√≠var Taraja. Fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88. Bolivar's Personal Beliefs Politics Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was an admirer of both the U.S. and French Revolutions. Bol√≠var even enrolled his nephew, Fernando Bol√≠var, in a private school in Philadelphia, Germantown Academy, and paid for his education, including attendance at Thomas Jefferson's University of Virginia. While he was an admirer of U.S. independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in Latin America. Thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like Venezuela \\"will require a firm hand\\". Bol√≠var felt that the U.S. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy. By contrast, he referred to Spanish America as having been subject to the \\"triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice\\". If a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty. This is shown when Bol√≠var blamed the fall of the first republic on his subordinates trying to imitate \\"some ethereal republic\\" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of South America. Among the books accompanying him as he traveled were Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, Voltaire's Letters and, when he was writing the Bolivian constitution, Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws. His Bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become Latin American conservatism in the later nineteenth century. The Bolivian constitution intended to establish a lifelong presidency and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the British unwritten constitution, as it existed at the time. According to Carlos Fuentes: Freemasonry Similarly to some others in the history of American Independence (George Washington, Miguel Hidalgo, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Bernardo O'Higgins, Francisco de Paula Santander, Antonio Nari√±o, and Francisco de Miranda), Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was a Freemason. He was initiated in 1803 in the Masonic Lodge Lautaro, which operated in C√°diz, Spain,. It was in this lodge that he first met some of his revolutionary peers, such as Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. In May 1806 he was conferred the rank of Master Mason in the \\"Scottish Mother of St. Alexander of Scotland\\" in Paris. During his time in London, he frequented \\"The Great American Reunion\\" lodge in London, founded by Francisco de Miranda. In April 1824, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was given the 33rd degree of Inspector General Honorary. He founded the Masonic Lodge No. 2 of Peru, named \\"Order and Liberty\\". Legacy Political legacy Due to the historical relevance of Bol√≠var as a key element during the process of independence in Hispanic America, his memory has been strongly attached to sentiments of nationalism and patriotism, being a recurrent theme of rhetoric in politics. Since the image of Bol√≠var became an important part to the national identities of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, his mantle is often claimed by Hispanic American politicians all across the political spectrum. In Venezuela, Bol√≠var left behind a militarist legacy with multiple governments utilizing the memory, image and written legacy of Bol√≠var as important parts of their political messages and propaganda. Bol√≠var disapproved of the excesses of \\"party spirit\\" and \\"factions\\", which led to an anti-political environment in Venezuela. For much of the 1800s, Venezuela was ruled by caudillos, with six rebellions occurring to take control of Venezuela between 1892 and 1900 alone. The militarist legacy was then used by the nationalist dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez and more recently the socialist political movement led by Hugo Ch√°vez. Monuments and physical legacy The nations of Bolivia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and their respective currencies (the Bolivian boliviano and the Venezuelan bol√≠var), are all named after Bol√≠var. Additionally, most cities and towns in Colombia and Venezuela are built around a main square known as Plaza Bol√≠var, as is the case with Bogot√°. In this example, most governmental buildings and public structures are located on or around the plaza, including the National Capitol and the Palace of Justice. Besides Quito and Caracas, there are monuments to Bol√≠var in the Latin American capitals of Lima, Buenos Aires, Havana, Mexico City, Panama City, Paramaribo, San Jos√©, Santo Domingo and Sucre. In Bogot√°, the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Park has hosted many concerts. Outside of Latin America, the variety of monuments to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var are a continuing testament to his legacy. These include statues in many capitals around the world, including Algiers, Bucharest, London, Minsk, Moscow,Press statement following Russian-Venezuelan talks // Kremlin.ru. 2010. 15 october New Delhi, Ottawa, Paris, Prague, Port- au-Prince, Rome, Sofia, Tehran, Vienna and Washington, D.C.. Several cities in Spain, especially in the Basque Country, have constructed monuments to Bol√≠var, including a large monument in Bilbao and a comprehensive Venezuelan government-funded museum in Cenarruza-Puebla de Bol√≠var, his ancestral hometown. In the US, an imposing bronze equestrian statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var stands at the southern entrance to Central Park at the Avenue of the Americas in New York City which also celebrates Bol√≠var's contributions to Latin America. The Bolivar Peninsula in Texas; Bolivar County, Mississippi; Bolivar, New York; Bolivar, West Virginia; Bolivar, Ohio; and Bolivar, Tennessee are also named in his honor. Note: this reference does not cover Ohio or Texas. Monuments to Bol√≠var's military legacy also comprise one of Venezuelan Navy's sail training barques, which is named after him, and the , a Benjamin Franklin-class fleet ballistic missile submarine which served with the U.S. Navy between 1965 and 1995. Minor planet 712 Boliviana discovered by Max Wolf is named in his honor. The name was suggested by Camille Flammarion. The first Venezuelan satellite, Venesat-1, was given the alternative name Sim√≥n Bol√≠var after him. His birthday is a public holiday in Venezuela and Bolivia.

In popular culture The triumphal march Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was composed in 1883 by Nicol√≤ Gabrielli to mark the 100th anniversary of Libertador's birth Bol√≠var has been depicted in opera, literature, film, and other media, and continues to be a part of the popular culture in many countries. In 1883, to celebrate 100 years since his birth, the Italian musician Nicol√≤ Gabrielli composed the triumphal march Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and dedicated it to then president of Venezuela Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco. In 1943 Darius Milhaud composed the opera Bol√≠var. He is also the central character in Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's 1989 novel The General in His Labyrinth, in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy. In 1969, Maximilian Schell played the role of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in the film of the same name by director Alessandro Blasetti, which also featured actress Rosanna Schiaffino. Bol√≠var's life was also the basis of the 2013 film Libertador, starring √âdgar Ram√≠rez and directed by Alberto Arvelo. In an episode of the Spanish TV series The Ministry of Time, \\"Tiempo de ilustrados (Time of the Enlightened)\\", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife, as this was considered fundamental for Bol√≠var to fulfil his destiny. Later in the second season of the series the time agents will find him again in 1828 (two years before his death) to avoid his murder, planned by Santander's followers. As of 2019, a Netflix series has been released depicting Bol√≠var's life and the major events surrounding it. The Netflix series is a Colombian production with Spanish as the main language. Bol√≠var features as a character in the Age of Empires III, in which he leads revolutionary armies in the Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs. He also leads Gran Colombia in the video game Civilization VI. Gran Colombia was added to the game as part of the New Frontier Pass.

He is currently the Floersheimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City, although Fish has no degrees or training in law. Fish has previously served as the Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Humanities and a professor of law at Florida International University and is dean emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Fish is associated with postmodernism, at times to his irritation. Instead he views himself as an advocate of anti-foundationalism.Baldacchino, Joseph. Humanitas. \\"Two Kinds of Criticism: Reflective Self-Scrutiny vs. Impulsive Self- Validation\\" He is also viewed as being an influence in the rise and development of reader-response theory. During his career he has also taught at the Cardozo School of Law, University of California, Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, The University of Pennsylvania, Yale Law School, Columbia University, The John Marshall Law School, and Duke University. Early life Fish was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He was raised Jewish. His father, an immigrant from Poland, was a plumber and contractor who made it a priority for his son to get a university education.Fish, Stanley. New York Times. \\"Max the Plumber\\" Fish became the first member of his family to attend college in the US, earning a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959, and an M.A. from Yale University in 1960.The Journal of Blacks In Higher Education No. 30 (Winter, 2000-2001), pp. 44-46. \\"Stanley Fish Reels in a School of Black Scholars\\" He completed his Ph.D. in 1962, also at Yale University. Academic career Fish taught English at the University of California at Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University before becoming Arts and Sciences Professor of English and professor of law at Duke University from 1986-98. From 1999 to 2004, he was Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as well as serving as Distinguished Visiting Professor at The John Marshall Law School from 2000 until 2002. He also held joint appointments in the Departments of Political Science and Criminal Justice, and was the chairman of the Religious Studies Committee. During his tenure there, he recruited professors respected in the academic community, and attracted attention to the College. After resigning as dean in a high-level dispute with the state of Illinois over funding UIC, Fish spent a year teaching in the Department of English. The Institute for the Humanities at UIC named a lecture series in his honor, which is still ongoing. In June 2005, he accepted the position of Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Humanities and Law at Florida International University, teaching in the FIU College of Law. In November 2010 he joined the Board of Visitors of Ralston College, a start-up institution in Savannah, Georgia. He has also been a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1985. Milton Fish started his career as a medievalist. His first book, published by Yale University Press in 1965, was on the late-medieval/early-Renaissance poet John Skelton. Fish explains in his partly biographical essay, \\"Milton, Thou Shouldst be Living at this Hour\\" (published in There's No Such Thing as Free Speech . . . And It's a Good Thing, Too), that he came to Milton by accident. In 1963, the same year that Fish started as an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley its resident Miltonist, Constantinos A. Patrides, received a grant. The chair of the department asked Fish to teach the Milton course, notwithstanding the fact that the young professor \\"had never -- either as an undergraduate or in graduate school -- taken a Milton course\\" (269). The eventual result was Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost (1967; rpt. 1997). Fish's 2001 book, How Milton Works, reflects five decades' worth of his scholarship on Milton. Interpretive communities Fish is best known for his analysis of interpretive communities -- an offshoot of reader-response criticism. His work in this field examines how the interpretation of a text is dependent upon each reader's own subjective experience in one or more communities, each of which is defined as a 'community' by a distinct epistemology. For Fish, a large part of what renders a reader‚Äôs subjective experience valuable ‚Äî that is, why it may be considered ‚Äúconstrained‚Äù as opposed to an uncontrolled and idiosyncratic assertion of the self ‚Äî comes from a concept native to the field of linguistics called linguistic competence. In Fish‚Äôs source the term is explained as ‚Äúthe idea that it is possible to characterize a linguistic system that every speaker shares.‚ÄùWardaugh, Ronald. Reading: a Linguistic Perspective. University of Michigan: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc., 1969. 36, 60. In the context of literary criticism, he uses this concept to argue that a reader‚Äôs approach to a text is not completely subjective, and that an internalized understanding of language shared by the native speakers of that given language makes possible the creation of normative boundaries for one‚Äôs experience with language. Fish and university politics Fish has written extensively on the politics of the university, having taken positions supporting campus speech codes and criticizing political statements by universities or faculty bodies on matters outside their professional areas of expertise.Fish, Stanley. ‚ÄúProfessors, Stop Opining About Trump.‚Äù The New York Times, The New York Times, 16 July 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/opinion/sunday/professors-stop-opining-about- trump.html. He argued in January 2008 on his New York Times-syndicated blog that the humanities are of no instrumental value, but have only intrinsic worth. He explains, \\"To the question 'of what use are the humanities?', the only honest answer is none whatsoever. And it is an answer that brings honor to its subject. Justification, after all, confers value on an activity from a perspective outside its performance. An activity that cannot be justified is an activity that refuses to regard itself as instrumental to some larger good. The humanities are their own good. There is nothing more to say, and anything that is said diminishes the object of its supposed praise.\\"Fish, Stanley. The New York Times. \\"Will the Humanities Save Us?\\", January 6, 2008. Fish has lectured across the USA at many universities and colleges including Florida Atlantic University, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, University of Toronto, Columbia University, the University of Vermont, the University of Georgia, the University of Louisville, San Diego State University, the University of Kentucky, Bates College, the University of Central Florida, the University of West Florida, and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Fish as university politician As chair of the Duke English department from 1986‚Äì92, Fish attracted attention and controversy. Fish, according to Lingua Franca, used \\"shameless‚Äîand in academe unheard- of‚Äîentrepreneurial gusto\\" to take \\"a respectable but staid Southern English department and transform it into the professional powerhouse of the day,\\" in part through the payment of lavish salaries. His time at Duke saw comparatively quite light undergraduate and graduate coursework requirements for students, matched by their heavy graduate teaching requirements. This permitted professors to reduce their own teaching. In April 1992, near the end of Fish's time as department chair, an external review committee considered evidence that the English curriculum had become \\"a hodgepodge of uncoordinated offerings,\\" lacking in \\"broad foundational courses\\" or faculty planning. The department's dissipating prominence in the 1990s was featured on the front page of The New York Times. Criticisms of his work As a frequent contributor to The New York TimesNew York Times: Stanley Fish , nytimes.com; accessed January 11, 2018. and The Wall Street Journal editorial page, Fish has been the target of wide-ranging criticism. Writing in Slate magazine, Judith Shulevitz reported that not only does Fish openly proclaim himself \\"unprincipled\\" but also rejects wholesale the concepts of \\"fairness, impartiality, reasonableness.\\" To Fish, \\"ideas have no consequences.\\" For taking this stance, Shulevitz characterizes Fish as \\"not the unprincipled relativist he's accused of being. He's something worse. He's a fatalist.\\"Slate. The Indefensible Stanley Fish, slate.com; accessed January 11, 2018. Likewise, among academics, Fish has endured vigorous criticism. The conservative R. V. Young writes, Terry Eagleton, a prominent British Marxist,The Independent.\\"Terry Eagleton: Class Warrior.\\" excoriates Fish's \\"discreditable epistemology\\" as \\"sinister\\". According to Eagleton, \\"Like almost all diatribes against universalism, Fish's critique of universalism has its own rigid universals: the priority at all times and places of sectoral interests, the permanence of conflict, the a priori status of belief systems, the rhetorical character of truth, the fact that all apparent openness is secretly closure, and the like.\\" Of Fish's attempt to co-opt the critiques leveled against him, Eagleton responds, \\"The felicitous upshot is that nobody can ever criticise Fish, since if their criticisms are intelligible to him, they belong to his cultural game and are thus not really criticisms at all; and if they are not intelligible, they belong to some other set of conventions entirely and are therefore irrelevant.\\"Eagleton, Terry. London Review of Books. \\"The Estate Agent\\"; accessed January 11, 2018. Philosopher Martha Nussbaum in her essay, Sophistry about Conventions, argues that Fish's theoretical views are based on \\"extreme relativism and even radical subjectivism.\\" Discounting his work as nothing more than sophistry, Nussbaum claims that Fish \\"relies on the regulative principle of non-contradiction in order to adjudicate between competing principles\\", thereby relying on normative standards of argumentation even as he argues against them. Offering an alternative, Nussbaum cites John Rawls's work in A Theory of Justice to highlight \\"an example of a rational argument; it can be said to yield, in a perfectly recognizable sense, ethical truth.\\" Nussbaum appropriates Rawls's critique of the insufficiencies of Utilitarianism, showing that a rational person will consistently prefer a system of justice that acknowledges boundaries between separate persons rather than relying on the aggregation of the sum total of desires. \\"This\\", she claims, \\"is altogether different from rhetorical manipulation.\\"Nussbaum, Martha C. Love's Knowledge. \\"Sophistry About Conventions\\", New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. pp. 220-29. Camille Paglia, author of Sexual Personae and public intellectual, denounced Fish as a \\"totalitarian Tinkerbell,\\" charging him with hypocrisy for lecturing about multiculturalism from the perspective of a tenured professor at the homogeneous and sheltered ivory tower of Duke.Gifts of Speech -- Camille Paglia, gos.sbc.edu; accessed January 11, 2018. David Hirsch, a critic of post-structuralist influences on hermeneutics, censured Fish for \\"lapses in logical rigor\\" and \\"carelessness toward rhetorical precision.\\" In an examination of Fish's arguments, Hirsch attempts to demonstrate that \\"not only was a restoration of New Critical methods unnecessary, but that Fish himself had not managed to rid himself of the shackles of New Critical theory.\\" Hirsch compares Fish's work to Penelope's loom in the Odyssey, stating, \\"what one critic weaves by day, another unweaves by night.\\" \\"Nor,\\" he writes, \\"does this weaving and unweaving constitute a dialectic, since no forward movement takes place.\\" Ultimately, Hirsch sees Fish as left to \\"wander in his own Elysian fields, hopelessly alienated from art, from truth, and from humanity.\\"Hirsch, David H. The Deconstruction of Literature: Criticism after Auschwitz. Hanover, New Hampshire: University Press of New England, 1991. pp. 4, 22-28, 68.

The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons. Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra. Urine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of blood. The urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. During urination, the urine is passed from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. 8002,000 milliliters (mL) of urine are normally produced every day in a healthy human. This amount varies according to fluid intake and kidney function. Structure 3D model of urinary system The urinary system refers to the structures that produce and transport urine to the point of excretion. In the human urinary system there are two kidneys that are located between the dorsal body wall and parietal peritoneum on both the left and right sides. The formation of urine begins within the functional unit of the kidney, the nephrons. Urine then flows through the nephrons, through a system of converging tubules called collecting ducts. These collecting ducts then join together to form the minor calyces, followed by the major calyces that ultimately join the renal pelvis. From here, urine continues its flow from the renal pelvis into the ureter, transporting urine into the urinary bladder. The anatomy of the human urinary system differs between males and females at the level of the urinary bladder. In males, the urethra begins at the internal urethral orifice in the trigone of the bladder, continues through the external urethral orifice, and then becomes the prostatic, membranous, bulbar, and penile urethra. Urine exits through the external urethral meatus. The female urethra is much shorter, beginning at the bladder neck and terminating in the vaginal vestibule. Development Microanatomy Under microscopy, the urinary system is covered in a unique lining called urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium. Unlike the epithelial lining of most organs, transitional epithelium can flatten and distend. Urothelium covers most of the urinary system, including the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder. Function The main functions of the urinary system and its components are to: * Regulate blood volume and composition (e.g. sodium, potassium and calcium) * Regulate blood pressure. * Regulate pH homeostasis of the blood. * Contributes to the production of red blood cells by the kidney. * Helps synthesize calcitriol (the active form of Vitamin D). * Stores waste product (mainly urea and uric acid) before it and other products are removed from the body. Urine formation Average urine production in adult humans is about 12 litres (L) per day, depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too much or too little urine requires medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive urine production (> 2.5 L/day). Oliguria when < 400 mL (millilitres) are produced, and anuria one of < 100 mL per day. The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood in the kidneys. In a healthy human the kidney receives between 12 and 30% of cardiac output, but it averages about 20% or about 1.25 L/min. The basic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. Its chief function is to regulate the concentration of water and soluble substances like sodium by filtering the blood, reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as urine. In the first part of the nephron, Bowman's capsule filters blood from the circulatory system into the tubules. Hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients facilitate filtration across a semipermeable membrane. The filtrate includes water, small molecules, and ions that easily pass through the filtration membrane. However larger molecules such as proteins and blood cells are prevented from passing through the filtration membrane. The amount of filtrate produced every minute is called the glomerular filtration rate or GFR and amounts to 180 litres per day. About 99% of this filtrate is reabsorbed as it passes through the nephron and the remaining 1% becomes urine. The urinary system is regulated by the endocrine system by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and parathyroid hormone. =Regulation of concentration and volume= The urinary system is under influence of the circulatory system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Aldosterone plays a central role in regulating blood pressure through its effects on the kidney. It acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron and increases reabsorption of sodium from the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption of sodium results in retention of water, which increases blood pressure and blood volume. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a neurohypophysial hormone found in most mammals. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and vasoconstriction. Vasopressin regulates the body's retention of water by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron. Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane. Urination Urination is the ejection of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. In healthy humans (and many other animals), the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as an involuntary reflex. Physiologically, micturition involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals the male ejects urine through the penis, and the female through the vulva. Clinical significance Urologic disease can involve congenital or acquired dysfunction of the urinary system. As an example, urinary tract obstruction is a urologic disease that can cause urinary retention. Diseases of the kidney tissue are normally treated by nephrologists, while diseases of the urinary tract are treated by urologists. Gynecologists may also treat female urinary incontinence. Diseases of other bodily systems also have a direct effect on urogenital function. For instance, it has been shown that protein released by the kidneys in diabetes mellitus sensitizes the kidney to the damaging effects of hypertension. Diabetes also can have a direct effect in urination due to peripheral neuropathies, which occur in some individuals with poorly controlled blood sugar levels. Urinary incontinence can result from a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles caused by factors such as pregnancy, childbirth, aging, and being overweight. Pelvic floor exercises known as Kegel exercises can help in this condition by strengthening the pelvic floor. There can also be underlying medical reasons for urinary incontinence which are often treatable. In children, the condition is called enuresis. Some cancers also target the urinary system, including bladder cancer, kidney cancer, ureteral cancer, and urethral cancer. Due to the role and location of these organs, treatment is often complicated. History Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about as long as written historical records exist. The urinary tract including the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been described by Galen in the second century AD. The first to examine the ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young in 1929. This was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. The insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the uterers and urinary tract, called nephrostomy], was first described in 1941. Such an approach differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.

Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\".Memidex/WordNet, \\"chronology,\\" memidex.com (accessed September 25, 2010). Chronology is a part of periodization. It is also a part of the discipline of history including earth history, the earth sciences, and study of the geologic time scale. Related fields Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon chronometry, which is also known as timekeeping, and historiography, which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. Radiocarbon dating estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of carbon-14 isotope in their carbon content. Dendrochronology estimates the age of trees by correlation of the various growth rings in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a calibration reference for radiocarbon dating curves. Calendar and era The familiar terms calendar and era (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the Christian era, which era was taken in use in the 8th century by Bede, was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. Dionysius Exiguus (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An epoch is the date (year usually) when an era begins. Ab Urbe condita era Ab Urbe condita is Latin for \\"from the founding of the City (Rome)\\",Literally translated as \\"From the city having been founded\\". traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two consuls who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was. It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian Orosius. Pope Boniface IV, in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and Anno Domini. (AD 1 = AUC 754.) Astronomical era Dionysius Exiguus' Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years AD) was extended by Bede to the complete Christian era (which contains, in addition all calendar years BC, but no year zero). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers Philippe de la Hire (in the year 1702) and Jacques Cassini (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the Julian Dating System (proposed in the year 1583 by Joseph Scaliger) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a leap year zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).Richards 2013, pp. 591-592. Prehistoric chronologies While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially astronomy, geology, paleontology and archaeology. In the absence of written history, with its chronicles and king lists, late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of Egyptology, William Flinders Petrie pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic Neolithic times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as seriation. Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: \\"The Beaker People\\" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences. Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative evidence. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable. Chronological synchronism The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the Chronicon of Eusebius (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. By comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an Anno Mundi (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Pentateuch. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as George Syncellus (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, De emendatione temporum (1583) and Thesaurus temporum (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works. Scaliger invented the concept of the Julian Day which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers. In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the Eclipse of Thales, described in the first book of Herodotus can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events. Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do sequence dating.

This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the rule of law.A description and analysis of the principle can be found in Shahram Dana, Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing, 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009) It has been described as \\"one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought.Justice Scalia in Rogers v. Tennessee, citing J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960) Requirements In modern European criminal law, e.g. of the Constitutional Court of Germany, the principle of nulla poena sine lege has been found to consist of four separate requirements: ;Nulla poena sine lege praevia: There is to be no penalty without previous law. This prohibits ex post facto laws, and the retroactive application of criminal law. It is a basic maxim in continental European legal thinking. It was written by Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach as part of the Bavarian Criminal Code in 1813. ;Nulla poena sine lege scripta: There is to be no penalty without written law. That is, criminal prohibitions must be set out in written legal instruments of general application, normally statutes, adopted in the form required by constitutional law. This excludes customary law as a basis of criminal punishment. ;Nulla poena sine lege certa: There is to be no penalty without well-defined law. This provides that a penal statute must define the punishable conduct and the penalty with sufficient definiteness. This to allow citizens to foresee when a specific action would be punishable, and to conduct themselves accordingly, a rule expressed in the general principle of legal certainty in matters of criminal law. It is recognised or codified in many national jurisdictions, as well as e.g. by the European Court of Justice as a \\"general principle of Union law\\". ;Nulla poena sine lege stricta: There is to be no penalty without exact law. This prohibits the application by analogy of statutory provisions in criminal law. In common law One complexity is the lawmaking power of judges under common law. Even in civil law systems that do not admit judge-made law, it is not always clear when the function of interpretation of the criminal law ends and judicial lawmaking begins. In English criminal law there are offences of common law origin. For example, murder is still a common law offence and lacks a statutory definition. The Homicide Act 1957 did not include a statutory definition of murder (or any other homicidal offense). Therefore, the definition of murder was the subject of no fewer than six appeals to the House of Lords within the following 40 years (Director of Public Prosecutions v. Smith [1961] A.C. 290; Hyam v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1975] A.C. 55; Regina v. Cunningham [1982] A.C. 566; Regina v. Moloney [1985] A.C. 905; Regina v. Hancock [1986] A.C. 455; Regina v. Woollin [1998] 4 A11 E.R. 103 (H.L.)).  In natural law  The legal principle nulla poena sine lege as principle in natural law is due to the contention of scholars of the Scholasticism about the preconditions of a guilty conscience. In relation to the Ezekiel-commentary of Jerome, Thomas Aquinas and Francisco Su√°rez analysed the formal conditions of the punishment of conscience. Thomas located the conditions within the synderesis. For him it is a formal and active part of the human soul. Understanding of activity, which is in accordance with the human nature, is formal possible due to the synderesis. Hence the synderesis contains in the works of patristic authors a law which commands how the human as human has to act. In the individual case this law is contentual definite. For the scholastic this is shown in the action of the intellect. This action is named since Thomas conscientia. A possible content of the conscientia is the punishment in concordance with the content of the synderesis, in case the human has had not act in concordance with the human nature. An example for the punishment is madness, which since antiquity is a punishment of conscience. The Oresteia is a famous example for this. According Su√°rez the punishment of conscience is the insight in an obligation to act in concordance with the human nature to undo a past misdeed. This insight obligates to impossible actions due to the fact that the misdeed is in the past and hence it is unchangeable. Therefore the conscientia obligates in concordance with the synderesis to do an impossible action. Hence the conscientia restricts conscientious persons by doing a limitation on their own will. For they are unable to think about any other action than to fulfil their obligation. Inasmuch the conscientia restricts the intellect the scholastic speak of it as a malum or malum metaphysicum, because the limitation is related to a metaphysical quality of a human. The law is constituted by the human nature itself from what the malum metaphysicum is inflicted. Therefore the punishment of the conscience is executed because of a violation of natural law. In cases of universal jurisdiction The question of jurisdiction may sometimes come to contradict this principle. For example, customary international law allows the prosecution of pirates by any country (applying universal jurisdiction), even if they did not commit crimes at the area that falls under this country's law. A similar principle has appeared in the recent decades with regard to crimes of genocide (see genocide as a crime under domestic law); and UN Security Council Resolution 1674 \\"reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\\"Resolution 1674 (2006) even if the State in which the population is being assaulted does not recognise these assaults as a breach of domestic law. However, it seems that universal jurisdiction is not to be expanded substantially to other crimes, so as to satisfy Nulla poena sine lege. Since the Nuremberg Trials, penal law is taken to include the prohibitions of international criminal law, in addition to those of domestic law. The normative content of nulla poena in international law is developed by Shahram Dana in \\"Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing\\" published in 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009). Thus, prosecutions have been possible of such individuals as Nazi war criminalsNuremberg Principles I & II state; \\"Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment.\\" and \\"The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law\\" respectively. and officials of the German Democratic Republic responsible for the Berlin Wall,Case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany (Applications nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98) (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 31 even though their deeds may have been allowed or even ordered by domestic law. Also, courts when dealing with such cases will tend to look to the letter of the law at the time, even in regimes where the law as it was written was generally disregarded in practice by its own authors. However, some legal scholars criticize this, because generally, in the legal systems of Continental Europe where the maxim was first developed, \\"penal law\\" was taken to mean statutory penal law, so as to create a guarantee to the individual, considered as a fundamental right, that he would not be prosecuted for an action or omission that was not considered a crime according to the statutes passed by the legislators in force at the time of the action or omission, and that only those penalties that were in place when the infringement took place would be applied. Also, even if one considers that certain actions are prohibited under general principles of international law, critics point out that a prohibition in a general principle does not amount to the establishment of a crime, and that the rules of international law also do not stipulate specific penalties for the violations. In an attempt to address those criticisms, the statute of the recently established International Criminal Court provides for a system in which crimes and penalties are expressly set out in written law, that shall only be applied to future cases. See Article 22 of the Rome Statute, however this is under the proviso, in Article 22(3) that this only applies to the ICC, and \\"doesn't affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law independently of [the Rome Statute]\\". The principle of nullia poena sine lege, insofar as it applies to general criminal law, is enshrined in several national constitutions, and international instruments, see European Convention on Human Rights, article 7(1). However, when applied to international criminal/humanitarian law, the same legal instruments often allow for ex post facto application of the law. See ECHR, article 7(2), which states that article 7(1) \\"shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.\\" See also See also * Everything which is not forbidden is allowed * Ex post facto law * List of Latin legal terms * Nulla poena sine culpa * Radbruch formula * Rechtsstaat * 1942-43 Riom Trial Notes References * Brocards Criminal law Latin legal terminology Legal doctrines and principles Quotations from law ","title":"Nulla poena sine lege"},{"id":"55941","text":"Jabber may refer to: * The original name of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), the open technology for instant messaging and presence. * Jabber.org, the public, free instant messaging and presence service based on XMPP. * Jabber XCP, a commercial product which is an implementation of XMPP.

It is also commonly used as an alternative to the question tag right?, i.e., method for inciting a reply, as in \\"It's nice here, eh?\\" (instead of \\"It's nice here, right?\\"). In North America, it is most commonly associated with Canada and Canadian English, and the area stretching from northern Wisconsin up to Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Similar interjections exist in other languages, such as Dutch, Azerbaijani, Armenian, Hokkien Chinese, Japanese, French, Finnish, Italian, Greek, Hebrew, Malay, Spanish, Persian, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish, Swahili, Korean, Catalan and Filipino. The spelling of this sound in English is quite different from the common usage of these letters. The vowel is sounded in one of the continental manners, and the letter h is used to indicate it is long, as though the origin of the spelling were German. It is an invariant question tag, unlike the \\"is it?\\" and \\"have you?\\" tags that have, with the insertion of not, different construction in positive and negative questions.  English   United States  \\"Eh\\" is also used in situations to describe something bad or mediocre, in which case it is often pronounced with a short \\"e\\" sound and the \\"h\\" may even be noticeable. Many Italian Americans, especially in the New York area, use the term \\"eh\\" as a general substitute for such basic greetings, such as \\"hey\\" or \\"hello\\".  Canada  According to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, a usage of eh that is distinct to Canada and some regions of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota, is for \\"ascertaining the comprehension, continued interest, agreement, etc., of the person or persons addressed\\" as in, \\"It's four kilometres away, eh, so I have to go by bike.\\" In that case, eh? is used to confirm the attention of the listener and to invite a supportive noise such as \\"Mm\\" or \\"Oh\\" or \\"Okay\\". This usage may be paraphrased as \\"I'm checking to see that you're [listening/following/in agreement] so I can continue.\\" Grammatically, this usage constitutes an interjection; functionally, it is an implicit request for back-channel communication. \\"Eh\\" can also be added to the end of a declarative sentence to turn it into a question seeking agreement. For example: \\"The weather is nice.\\" becomes \\"The weather is nice, eh?\\" This same phrase could also be taken as \\"The weather is nice, don't you agree?\\". In this usage, it is similar to Scots \\"eh no?\\", English \\"isn't it?\\", Portuguese \\"n√©?\\", \\"Dutch \\"h√®?\\", Japanese \\"ne?\\", Mandarin \\"bƒÅ\\" or French \\"hein?\\" (which differs from the French usage of \\"n'est-ce pas?\\" (\\"Is it not?\\") in that it does not use a (technically double or emphatic) negative). The usage of \\"eh\\" in Canada is occasionally mocked in the United States, where some view its use as a stereotypical Canadianism. Such stereotypes have been reinforced in popular culture, and were famously lampooned in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Singer Don Freed in his song \\"Saskatchewan\\" declares \\"What is this 'Eh?' nonsense? I wouldn't speak like that if I were paid to.\\" There are many merchandise items on the market today that use this phrase, such as T-shirts and coffee mugs. It is often joked about by Canadians and Yoopers as well, and is sometimes even a part of the national or regional identity.Will Ferguson & Ian Ferguson, How to be a Canadian (Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre) pp. 65-68 For example, a Canadian national team is sometimes referred to as \\"the Eh? team\\". Likewise, at one of their concerts, a member of the Canadian Brass, referring to their arrangement of the jazz standard \\"Take the A Train\\", said that they'd considered calling it \\"Take the train, eh?\\". A classic joke illuminating this: \\"How did they name Canada? The letters were thrown in a bag, and the first one to be picked was 'C' eh?, then 'N' eh? and finally 'D' eh?\\" In the Canadian animated faux-reality show Total Drama Island, one of the 22 teen characters depicted on the show, Ezekiel, is a stereotypical Canadian yokel who uses the term \\"Eh\\", usually at the end of a sentence.  New Zealand  While not as commonly lampooned as the Canadian \\"eh\\", there are few features that are more eagerly recognized by New Zealanders as a marker of their identity than the tag particle \\"eh\\".Meyerhoff, Miriam. (1994). Sounds Pretty Ethnic, eh?: A Pragmatic Particle in New Zealand English. Language in Society, 23 (3), 367-388. Retrieved February 26, 2009 from This commonly used and referenced feature of New Zealand English (NZE) is one of great controversy to many communication scholars as it is both a mark of cultural identity and simultaneously a means to parody those of a lower socioeconomic status. The use of \\"eh\\" in New Zealand is very common among all demographics, although initially it was frequently linked with two main groups of people, the first being young, working-class, suburban Pakeha women and the second being working-class Maori men. The Pakeha are New Zealanders of British or European descent and Maori are indigenous Polynesians. A 1994 study by communications scholar Miriam Meyerhoff sought to examine the function of \\"eh\\" in New Zealand culture. She hypothesized that \\"eh\\" did not function as a clarification device as frequently believed, but instead served as a means of establishing solidarity between individuals of similar ethnic descent. In her research, Meyerhoff analyzed conversations between an interviewer and an interviewee of either Pakeha or Maori descent and calculated the frequency of \\"eh\\" in the conversation. In order to yield the most natural speech, Meyerhoff instructed the interviewers to introduce themselves as a \\"friend of a friend\\", to their respective interviewees. Her results showed Maori men as the most frequent users of \\"eh\\" in their interviews. As Maori are typically of a lower socio-economic status, Meyerhoff proposed that \\"eh\\" functioned as a verbal cue that one reciprocated by another individual signified both shared identity and mutual acceptance. Therefore, in the context of Meyerhoff's research, \\"eh\\" can be equated as a device to establish and maintain a group identity. This phenomenon sheds light on the continuous scholarly debate questioning if language determines culture or culture determines language.  Elsewhere  The usage of the word is widespread throughout much of the UK, particularly in Wales and the north of England, Eastern Scotland, Northern Ireland, in places such as Yorkshire, Lancashire, and the English Midlands. It is normally used to mean \\"what?\\". In Scotland, mainly around the Tayside region, \\"eh\\" is also used as a shortened term for \\"yes\\". For example, \\"Are you going to the Disco?\\" \\"eh.\\" \\"Eh?\\" used to solicit agreement or confirmation is also heard regularly amongst speakers in Australia and the United Kingdom (where it is sometimes spelled \\"ay\\" on the assumption that \\"eh\\" would rhyme with \\"heh\\" or \\"meh\\"). In the Caribbean island of Barbados the word \\"nuh\\" acts similarly, as does \\"noh\\" in Surinamese Dutch and Sranantongo. The usage in New Zealand is similar, and is more common in the North Island. It is also heard in the United States, especially Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (although the Scandinavian-based Yooperism \\"ya\\" is more common), Oklahoma and the New England region. In New England and Oklahoma, it is also used as a general exclamation as in Scotland and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey. It is occasionally used to express indifference, in a similar way to \\"meh\\". Since usage of the word \\"eh\\" is not as common in the United States as it is in Canada, it is often used by Americans, and indeed Canadians themselves, to parody Canadian English. The equivalent in South African English is \\"hey\\". \\"Eh\\" is also used in Guernsey English and Jersey English. \\"Eh\\" is very common in the English spoken in the Seychelles. In Singapore, the use of medium Singlish often includes \\"Eh\\" as an interjection, but it is not as popularly used as \\"lah\\". An example of a sentence that uses \\"eh\\" is \\"Dis guy Singlish damn good eh\\", meaning \\"this guy's Singlish is very good\\".  Similar terms in other languages  *H√® (\\"heh\\" ) (not to be confused with h√© (\\"hey\\" ), an informal greeting and (potentially rude) way of getting someone's attention) is an informal yet very common Dutch interjection that can be used as a brief exclamation to indicate confusion or surprise (\\"huh?\\"), in a prolonged manner when disappointed or annoyed (\\"aww\\"), or at the end of any sentence to form a tag question. The third usage is arguably the most popular. It very closely compares with \\"Eh\\" in Canadian English. In the regional dialects of Zealand and West Flanders, the corresponding and frequently used interjection \\"h√©\\", is in fact pronounced the same as in English (note that the equivalent of Dutch [h] is silent in Zealandic and West Flemish). *Japanese H√©? () is a common exclamation in Japanese and is used to express surprise. It is also used when the listener did not fully understand or hear what the speaker said. It can be lengthened to show greater surprise (e.g. Heeeeee?!). Ne and naa are extremely similar to the Canadian eh, being statement ending particles which solicit or assume agreement, confirmation, or comprehension on the part of the listener. *Portuguese n√©?, a contraction of n√£o √©? meaning \\"isn't it?\\", is used to turn a statement in to a question, even if no answer is expected, for emphasis or other objectives. *Hein is used in French and in Portuguese in much the same way as in English. *Hain is used in Mauritian Creole and it can express a variety of ideas. It is generally used in context of a conversation and is generally interpreted very quickly. *Gell/gelle or oder, wa, wat or wahr (\\"true\\" or \\"correct\\") or n√§/ne/net (from nicht, \\"not\\") are used in (very) colloquial German to express a positive interrogative at the end of a sentence, much as Eh is used in Canadian English. Statements expressed in Standard German are more commonly phrased in negative terms and outside of colloquial usage the ending interrogative is often nicht wahr, which invites a response of stimmt (\\"agreed\\", literally \\"that's right\\"). *Nietwaar is used in Dutch in the same way as nicht wahr is in German. *Spanish \\"¬øNo?\\", literally translated to English as \\"no\\", is often put at the end of a statement to change it into a question and give emphasis. I.e. \\"Hace buen tiempo, ¬øno?\\" (The weather is nice, isn't it?) Eh is also used as well to emphasize, as in \\"¬°Te vas a caer de la silla, eh!\\" (You're going to fall, if you keep doing that!) Che also has a similar function. In Catalan, \\"eh?\\" is also commonly used. *Swiss German \\"Oder\\" which means \\"or\\" in English is commonly used interrogatively as \\"... or what?\\" and \\"g√§ll/gell\\" at the end of sentences in German-speaking Switzerland, especially in the Zurich area. It is used more as a matter of conversational convention than for its meaning. The expression \\"ni\\" is used in highest allemanic speaking parts, and is used similarly to \\"net\\" in German. The term √Ñh is also used, which is pronounced similarly to eh in English and has the same meaning. *Azerbaijani \\"'\\", \\"'\\", \\"\\"'\\", \\"'\\" are commonly used as \\"huh?\\". Alternatively, \\"'\\" (\\"yes?\\"), and \\"'\\" (\\"is it correct?\\") can be used as \\"isn't it?\\". *Pakistani Urdu \\"€Å€å⁄∫ÿü\\" used as \\"What? say it again\\". *Egyptian Arabic \\"ÿßŸäŸáÿü\\" () as \\"What? say it again\\". It could also mean \\"What's wrong?\\" either in a concerned manner or a more aggressive one, depending on the tone used to pose the question. Besides, it could refer to an exclamation. *Levantine Arabic \\"ÿßŸäÿ¥\\" or \\"ÿ¥Ÿà\\" (Esh, Shoo) as \\"What?\\". *Gulf region Arabic \\"Ÿàÿ¥Ÿà\\" (wisho) as \\"What?\\". *Regional Italian \\"Neh\\" is used in regional Northern Italian as spoken in Piedmont, Western Lombardy (Northwestern Italy), and the Ticino (Southern Switzerland), with the meaning of \\"isn't it true?\\". It comes from the expression in the local languages (Piedmontese and Lombard) \\"N'√® (mia/pa) vera?\\", which means, once again, \\"isn't it true?\\"  References  Canadian culture Canadian English New Zealand culture Interjections Interrogative words and phrases English words ","title":"Eh"},{"id":"55951","title":"Instant messaging"},{"id":"55955","text":"In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. Version control is a component of software configuration management. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the \\"revision number\\", \\"revision level\\", or simply \\"revision\\". For example, an initial set of files is \\"revision 1\\". When the first change is made, the resulting set is \\"revision 2\\", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may concurrently make changes to the same files. Version control systems (VCS) are most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, collaborative web docs. and in various content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia's page history. Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming in wikis. Overview In computer software engineering, revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code. As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. Bugs or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs. It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently: for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new features (branch), while the other version is where new features are worked on (trunk). At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately. This simple approach has been used in many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained. This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers and often leads to mistakes. Since the code base is the same, it also requires granting read-write-execute permission to a set of developers, and this adds the pressure of someone managing permissions so that the code base is not compromised, which adds more complexity. Consequently, systems to automate some or all of the revision control process have been developed. This ensures that the majority of management of version control steps is hidden behind the scenes. Moreover, in software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests. Sophisticated revision control that tracks and accounts for ownership of changes to documents and code may be extremely helpful or even indispensable in such situations. Revision control may also track changes to configuration files, such as those typically stored in \`/etc\` or \`/usr/local/etc\` on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.  History  IBM's OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool dates back to 1962, arguably a precursor to VCS tools. A full system designed for source code control was started in 1972, SCCS for the same system (OS/360). SCSS introduction, published December 4, 1975, historically implied it was the first deliberate system. RCS followed just after, with its networked version CVS. The next generation after CVS was dominated by Subversion, followed by the rise of distributed revision control (e.g. git). Structure Revision control manages changes to a set of data over time. These changes can be structured in various ways. Often the data is thought of as a collection of many individual items, such as files or documents, and changes to individual files are tracked. This accords with intuitions about separate files but causes problems when identity changes, such as during renaming, splitting or merging of files. Accordingly, some systems such as Git, instead consider changes to the data as a whole, which is less intuitive for simple changes but simplifies more complex changes. When data that is under revision control is modified, after being retrieved by checking out, this is not in general immediately reflected in the revision control system (in the repository), but must instead be checked in or committed. A copy outside revision control is known as a \\"working copy\\". As a simple example, when editing a computer file, the data stored in memory by the editing program is the working copy, which is committed by saving. Concretely, one may print out a document, edit it by hand, and only later manually input the changes into a computer and save it. For source code control, the working copy is instead a copy of all files in a particular revision, generally stored locally on the developer's computer;In this case, edit buffers are a secondary form of working copy, and not referred to as such. in this case saving the file only changes the working copy, and checking into the repository is a separate step. If multiple people are working on a single data set or document, they are implicitly creating branches of the data (in their working copies), and thus issues of merging arise, as discussed below. For simple collaborative document editing, this can be prevented by using file locking or simply avoiding working on the same document that someone else is working on. Revision control systems are often centralized, with a single authoritative data store, the repository, and check-outs and check-ins done with reference to this central repository. Alternatively, in distributed revision control, no single repository is authoritative, and data can be checked out and checked into any repository. When checking into a different repository, this is interpreted as a merge or patch. Graph structure Example history graph of a revision-controlled project; trunk is in green, branches in yellow, and graph is not a tree due to presence of merges (the red arrows). In terms of graph theory, revisions are generally thought of as a line of development (the trunk) with branches off of this, forming a directed tree, visualized as one or more parallel lines of development (the \\"mainlines\\" of the branches) branching off a trunk. In reality the structure is more complicated, forming a directed acyclic graph, but for many purposes \\"tree with merges\\" is an adequate approximation. Revisions occur in sequence over time, and thus can be arranged in order, either by revision number or timestamp.In principle two revisions can have identical timestamp, and thus cannot be ordered on a line. This is generally the case for separate repositories, though is also possible for simultaneous changes to several branches in a single repository. In these cases, the revisions can be thought of as a set of separate lines, one per repository or branch (or branch within a repository). Revisions are based on past revisions, though it is possible to largely or completely replace an earlier revision, such as \\"delete all existing text, insert new text\\". In the simplest case, with no branching or undoing, each revision is based on its immediate predecessor alone, and they form a simple line, with a single latest version, the \\"HEAD\\" revision or tip. In graph theory terms, drawing each revision as a point and each \\"derived revision\\" relationship as an arrow (conventionally pointing from older to newer, in the same direction as time), this is a linear graph. If there is branching, so multiple future revisions are based on a past revision, or undoing, so a revision can depend on a revision older than its immediate predecessor, then the resulting graph is instead a directed tree (each node can have more than one child), and has multiple tips, corresponding to the revisions without children (\\"latest revision on each branch\\").The revision or repository \\"tree\\" should not be confused with the directory tree of files in a working copy. In principle the resulting tree need not have a preferred tip (\\"main\\" latest revision) ‚Äì just various different revisions ‚Äì but in practice one tip is generally identified as HEAD. When a new revision is based on HEAD, it is either identified as the new HEAD, or considered a new branch.Note that if a new branch is based on HEAD, then topologically HEAD is no longer a tip, since it has a child. The list of revisions from the start to HEAD (in graph theory terms, the unique path in the tree, which forms a linear graph as before) is the trunk or mainline.\\"Mainline\\" can also refer to the main path in a separate branch. Conversely, when a revision can be based on more than one previous revision (when a node can have more than one parent), the resulting process is called a merge, and is one of the most complex aspects of revision control. This most often occurs when changes occur in multiple branches (most often two, but more are possible), which are then merged into a single branch incorporating both changes. If these changes overlap, it may be difficult or impossible to merge, and require manual intervention or rewriting. In the presence of merges, the resulting graph is no longer a tree, as nodes can have multiple parents, but is instead a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG). The graph is acyclic since parents are always backwards in time, and rooted because there is an oldest version. However, assuming that there is a trunk, merges from branches can be considered as \\"external\\" to the tree ‚Äì the changes in the branch are packaged up as a patch, which is applied to HEAD (of the trunk), creating a new revision without any explicit reference to the branch, and preserving the tree structure. Thus, while the actual relations between versions form a DAG, this can be considered a tree plus merges, and the trunk itself is a line. In distributed revision control, in the presence of multiple repositories these may be based on a single original version (a root of the tree), but there need not be an original root, and thus only a separate root (oldest revision) for each repository, for example, if two people starting working on a project separately. Similarly in the presence of multiple data sets (multiple projects) that exchange data or merge, there isn't a single root, though for simplicity one may think of one project as primary and the other as secondary, merged into the first with or without its own revision history. Specialized strategies Engineering revision control developed from formalized processes based on tracking revisions of early blueprints or bluelines. This system of control implicitly allowed returning to an earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. A revision table was used to keep track of the changes made. Additionally, the modified areas of the drawing were highlighted using revision clouds. Version control is widespread in business and law. Indeed, \\"contract redline\\" and \\"legal blackline\\" are some of the earliest forms of revision control,For Engineering drawings, see Whiteprint#Document control, for some of the manual systems in place in the twentieth century, for example, the Engineering Procedures of Hughes Aircraft, each revision of which required approval by Lawrence A. Hyland; see also the approval procedures instituted by the U.S. government. and are still employed in business and law with varying degrees of sophistication. The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to CAD files (see product data management), supplanting the \\"manual\\" electronic implementation of traditional revision control. Source-management models Traditional revision control systems use a centralized model where all the revision control functions take place on a shared server. If two developers try to change the same file at the same time, without some method of managing access the developers may end up overwriting each other's work. Centralized revision control systems solve this problem in one of two different \\"source management models\\": file locking and version merging. Atomic operations An operation is atomic if the system is left in a consistent state even if the operation is interrupted. The commit operation is usually the most critical in this sense. Commits tell the revision control system to make a group of changes final, and available to all users. Not all revision control systems have atomic commits; notably, CVS lacks this feature. File locking The simplest method of preventing \\"concurrent access\\" problems involves locking files so that only one developer at a time has write access to the central \\"repository\\" copies of those files. Once one developer \\"checks out\\" a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer \\"checks in\\" the updated version (or cancels the checkout). File locking has both merits and drawbacks. It can provide some protection against difficult merge conflicts when a user is making radical changes to many sections of a large file (or group of files). However, if the files are left exclusively locked for too long, other developers may be tempted to bypass the revision control software and change the files locally, forcing a difficult manual merge when the other changes are finally checked in. In a large organization, files can be left \\"checked out\\" and locked and forgotten about as developers move between projects - these tools may or may not make it easy to see who has a file checked out. Version merging Most version control systems allow multiple developers to edit the same file at the same time. The first developer to \\"check in\\" changes to the central repository always succeeds. The system may provide facilities to merge further changes into the central repository, and preserve the changes from the first developer when other developers check in. Merging two files can be a very delicate operation, and usually possible only if the data structure is simple, as in text files. The result of a merge of two image files might not result in an image file at all. The second developer checking in the code will need to take care with the merge, to make sure that the changes are compatible and that the merge operation does not introduce its own logic errors within the files. These problems limit the availability of automatic or semi-automatic merge operations mainly to simple text-based documents, unless a specific merge plugin is available for the file types. The concept of a reserved edit can provide an optional means to explicitly lock a file for exclusive write access, even when a merging capability exists. Baselines, labels and tags Most revision control tools will use only one of these similar terms (baseline, label, tag) to refer to the action of identifying a snapshot (\\"label the project\\") or the record of the snapshot (\\"try it with baseline X\\"). Typically only one of the terms baseline, label, or tag is used in documentation or discussion; they can be considered synonyms. In most projects, some snapshots are more significant than others, such as those used to indicate published releases, branches, or milestones. When both the term baseline and either of label or tag are used together in the same context, label and tag usually refer to the mechanism within the tool of identifying or making the record of the snapshot, and baseline indicates the increased significance of any given label or tag. Most formal discussion of configuration management uses the term baseline. Distributed revision control Distributed revision control systems (DRCS) take a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a bona-fide repository. Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging patches (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system: * No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies. * Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server. Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers. * Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change- history, providing inherent protection against data loss. Integration Some of the more advanced revision-control tools offer many other facilities, allowing deeper integration with other tools and software-engineering processes. Plugins are often available for IDEs such as Oracle JDeveloper, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Visual Studio. Delphi, NetBeans IDE, Xcode, and GNU Emacs (via vc.el). Advanced research prototypes generate appropriate commit messages, but it only works on projects with already a large history, because commit messages are very dependent on the conventions and idiosyncrasies of the project. Common terminology Terminology can vary from system to system, but some terms in common usage include: ; Baseline : An approved revision of a document or source file to which subsequent changes can be made. See baselines, labels and tags. ; Branch : A set of files under version control may be branched or forked at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other. ; Change : A change (or diff, or delta) represents a specific modification to a document under version control. The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems. ; Change list : On many version control systems with atomic multi-change commits, a change list (or CL), change set, update, or patch identifies the set of changes made in a single commit. This can also represent a sequential view of the source code, allowing the examination of source as of any particular changelist ID. ; Checkout :To check out (or co) is to create a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also be used as a noun to describe the working copy. When a file has been checked out from a shared file server, it cannot be edited by other users. Think of it like a hotel, when you check out, you no longer have access to its amenities. ; Clone : Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions. ; Commit (noun): A 'commit' or 'revision' (SVN) is a modification that is applied to the repository. ; Commit (verb) : To commit (check in, ci or, more rarely, install, submit or record) is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. A commit contains metadata, typically the author information and a commit message that describes the change. ; Conflict : A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes. A user must resolve the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favour of the other. ; Delta compression : Most revision control software uses delta compression, which retains only the differences between successive versions of files. This allows for more efficient storage of many different versions of files. ; Dynamic stream : A stream in which some or all file versions are mirrors of the parent stream's versions. ; Export : exporting is the act of obtaining the files from the repository. It is similar to checking out except that it creates a clean directory tree without the version-control metadata used in a working copy. This is often used prior to publishing the contents, for example. ; Fetch : See pull. ; Forward integration : The process of merging changes made in the main trunk into a development (feature or team) branch. ; Head: Also sometimes called tip, this refers to the most recent commit, either to the trunk or to a branch. The trunk and each branch have their own head, though HEAD is sometimes loosely used to refer to the trunk. ; Import : importing is the act of copying a local directory tree (that is not currently a working copy) into the repository for the first time. ; Initialize : to create a new, empty repository. ; Interleaved deltas : some revision control software uses Interleaved deltas, a method that allows storing the history of text based files in a more efficient way than by using Delta compression. ; Label : See tag. ; Locking : When a developer locks a file, no-one else can update that file until it is unlocked. Locking can be supported by the version control system, or via informal communications between developers (aka social locking). ; Mainline : Similar to trunk, but there can be a mainline for each branch. ; Merge : A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows: :* A user, working on a set of files, updates or syncs their working copy with changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users. :* A user tries to check in files that have been updated by others since the files were checked out, and the revision control software automatically merges the files (typically, after prompting the user if it should proceed with the automatic merge, and in some cases only doing so if the merge can be clearly and reasonably resolved). :* A branch is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified trunk. :* A set of files is branched, a problem that existed before the branching is fixed in one branch, and the fix is then merged into the other branch. (This type of selective merge is sometimes known as a cherry pick to distinguish it from the complete merge in the previous case.) ; Promote : The act of copying file content from a less controlled location into a more controlled location. For example, from a user's workspace into a repository, or from a stream to its parent. ; Pull, push: Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update. ; Repository : The repository (or \\"repo\\") is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a depot. ; Resolve : The act of user intervention to address a conflict between different changes to the same document. ; Reverse integration : The process of merging different team branches into the main trunk of the versioning system. ; Revision : Also version: A version is any change in form. In SVK, a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository. ; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches. ; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream. ; Tag : A tag or label refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files. These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number. See baselines, labels and tags. ; Trunk: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline, Mainline or Master) ; Update : An update (or sync, but sync can also mean a combined push and pull) merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local working copy. Update is also the term used by some CM tools (CM+, PLS, SMS) for the change package concept (see changelist). Synonymous with checkout in revision control systems that require each repository to have exactly one working copy (common in distributed systems) ; Unlocking: releasing a lock. ; Working copy: The working copy is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a sandbox. ;Pull request: A developer telling others to review his \\"pushed\\" changes See also * Change control * Changelog * Comparison of version- control software * Distributed version control * List of version-control software * Non-linear editing system * Software configuration management * Software versioning * Versioning file system Notes References External links * . * .

Politicians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics. Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments.

Bureaucracy and spoils Once elected, the politician becomes a government official and has to deal with a permanent bureaucracy of non-politicians. Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.Joel D. Aberbach, Robert D. Putnam, and Bert A.

Civil service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of government services that were involved.David A. Schultz, and Robert Maranto, eds., The politics of civil service reform (1998). However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today.Morris Szeftel, \\"Political graft and the spoils system in Zambia‚Äîthe state as a resource in itself.\\" Review of African Political Economy 9.24 (1982): 4‚Äì21.

They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement. Second, are the \\"political careerists\\". These are politicians who gain a reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts.Andrea Mattozzi and Antonio Merlo, \\"Political careers or career politicians?.\\" Journal of Public Economics 92#3 (2008): 597‚Äì608. The personal histories of politicians have been frequently studied, as it is presumed that their experiences and characteristics shape their beliefs and behaviors. There are four pathways by which a politician's biography could influence their leadership style and abilities. The first is that biography may influence one's core beliefs, which are used to shape a worldview. The second is that politicians' skills and competence are influenced by personal experience. The areas of skill and competence can define where they devote resources and attention as a leader. The third pathway is that biographical attributes may define and shape political incentives. A leader's previous profession, for example, could be viewed as higher importance, causing a disproportionate investment of leadership resources to ensure the growth and health of that profession, including former colleagues. Other examples beside profession include the politician's innate characteristics, such as race or gender. The fourth pathway is how a politician's biography affects their public perception, which can, in turn, affect their leadership style. Female politicians, for example, may use different strategies to attract the same level of respect given to male politicians. Characteristics Numerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections.Timothy S. Prinz, \\"The career paths of elected politicians: a review and prospectus.\\" in Shirley Williams and Edward L. Lascher, eds. Ambition and beyond: career paths of American politicians (1993) pp: 11-63. In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians.Elina Haavio-Mannila and Torild Skard, eds. Unfinished Democracy: women in Nordic politics (2013) For example, there are studies of the \\"Supermadre\\" model in Latin American politics.Elsa M. Chaney, Supermadre: Women in Politics in Latin America (University of Texas Press, 2014). Many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents‚Äîit is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player. United States Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were renowned for their memories. Criticism Many critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public. Areas of friction include the manner in which politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to \\"obscure, mislead, and confuse\\".Invitation to Critical Thinking - Page 319, Vincent E. Barry - 2007 In the popular image, politicians are thought of as clueless, selfish, manipulators, liars, incompetents and corrupts, taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public good.Arnold J. Heidenheimer and Michael Johnston, eds. Political corruption: Concepts and contexts (2011). Politicians in many countries are regarded as the \\"most hated professionals\\".Arnold J.

Secretar√≠a Nacional de Cultura de Paraguay) was fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over control of the northern part of the Gran Chaco region (known in Spanish as Chaco Boreal) of South America, which was thought to be rich in oil. It is also referred to as La Guerra de la Sed (Spanish for \\"The War of Thirst\\") in literary circles, for being fought in the semi-arid Chaco. It was the bloodiest military conflict fought in South America during the 20th century, between two of its poorest countries, both having previously lost territory to neighbors in 19th-century wars. During the war, both landlocked countries faced difficulties shipping arms and supplies through neighboring countries. Bolivia faced particular external trade problems, coupled with poor internal communications. Although Bolivia had lucrative mining income and a larger, better-equipped army, a series of factors turned the tide against it, and Paraguay came to control most of the disputed zone by war's end. The ultimate peace treaties granted two-thirds of the disputed territories to Paraguay.  Origins  The origin of the war is commonly attributed to a long-standing territorial dispute and the discovery of oil deposits on the eastern Andes range. In 1929, the Treaty of Lima ended the hopes of the Bolivian government of recovering a land corridor to the Pacific Ocean, which was thought imperative to further development and trade.Hunefeldt, Christine, A Brief History of Peru, New York, NY: Facts on File, Inc., (2004) p. 149Morales Q., Waltraud, Brief History of Bolivia. New York, NY: Facts on File, Inc., (2003)p. 83 The impetus for war was exacerbated by a conflict between oil companies jockeying for exploration and drilling rights, with Royal Dutch Shell backing Paraguay and Standard Oil supporting Bolivia.\\"Para la mayor√≠a de las voces, el conflicto entre Bolivia y Paraguay (1932-1935) tuvo su origen en el control del supuesto petr√≥leo que pronto ir√≠a a flu√≠r desde el desierto chaque√±o en beneficio de la naci√≥n victoriosa.\\" The discovery of oil in the Andean foothills sparked speculation that the Chaco might prove a rich source of petroleum, and foreign oil companies were involved in the exploration. Standard Oil was already producing oil from wells in the high hills of eastern Bolivia, around Villa Montes. However, it is uncertain if the war would have been caused solely by the interests of these companies, and not by aims of Argentina to import oil from the Chaco. In opposition to the \\"dependency theory\\" of the war's origins, the British historian Matthew Hughes argued against the thesis that Bolivian and Paraguayan governments were the \\"puppets\\" of Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell respectively, writing: \\"In fact, there is little hard evidence available in the company and government archives to support the theory that oil companies had anything to do with causing the war or helping one side or the other during the war\\".Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 415 Both Bolivia and Paraguay were landlocked. Though the 600,000 km2 Chaco was sparsely populated, control of the Paraguay River running through it provided access to the Atlantic Ocean.Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 412 This became especially important to Bolivia, which had lost its Pacific coast to Chile in the 1879 War of the Pacific.Guerra entre Bolivia y Paraguay: 1928-1935 by Ana Maria Musico Aschiero Paraguay had lost almost half of its territory to Brazil and Argentina in the Paraguayan War of 1864-1870\\\\. The country was not prepared to surrender its economic viability.The Chaco War In international arbitration, Bolivia argued that the region had been part of the original Spanish colonial province of Moxos and Chiquitos to which Bolivia was heir. Meanwhile, Paraguay based its case on the occupation of the land. Indeed, both Paraguayan and Argentine planters were already breeding cattle and exploiting quebracho woods in the area,Farcau, Bruce W. (1996). The Chaco War: Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932‚Äì1935. Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 7‚Äì8. while the small nomadic indigenous population of Guaran√≠-speaking tribes was related to Paraguay's own Guaran√≠ heritage. As of 1919, Argentine banks owned 400,000 hectares of land in the eastern Chaco while the Casado family, a powerful part of the Argentine oligarchy, held 141,000.Farcau, p. 11 The presence of Mennonite colonies in the Chaco, who settled there in the 1920s under the auspices of the Paraguayan parliament, was another factor in favour of Paraguay's claim.Hughes, Matthew (2005). Logistic and Chaco War: Bolivia vs. Paraguay, 1932‚Äì1935 The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, pp. 411‚Äì437  Prelude to the war  Paraguayan (1924, 1927 and 1932) and Bolivian (1928) stamps. The 1924 Paraguayan stamp shows no border with Bolivia, in 1927 the border runs to the north from Gran Chaco ‚Äì it later moved even further north with the disputed territory called Paraguayan Chaco; with slogan saying \\"was, is and will be [ours]\\". The Bolivian stamp labels the region as the Bolivian Chaco. Map of Paraguay (USA, 1935) The first confrontation between the two countries dates back to 1885, when the Bolivian entrepreneur Miguel Ara√±a Su√°rez founded Puerto Pacheco, a port on the upper Paraguay river, south of Bah√≠a Negra. He assumed that the new settlement was well inside Bolivian territory, but Bolivia had implicitly recognized Bah√≠a Negra as Paraguayan. The Paraguayan government sent in a naval detachment aboard the gunboat Pirap√≥, which forcibly evicted the Bolivians from the area in 1888.Farcau, p. 8La Armada Paraguaya: La Segunda Armada Two agreements followed‚Äîin 1894 and 1907‚Äîwhich neither the Bolivian nor the Paraguayan parliament ever approved.Farcau, p. 9 Meanwhile, in 1905 Bolivia founded two new outposts in the Chaco, Ballivi√°n and Guachalla, this time along the Pilcomayo River. The Bolivian government ignored the half- hearted Paraguayan official protest. Bolivian penetration in the region went unopposed until 1927, when the first blood was shed over the Chaco Boreal. On 27 February a Paraguayan army foot patrol and its native guides were taken prisoners near the Pilcomayo River and held in the Bolivian outpost of Fortin Sorpresa, where the commander of the Paraguayan platoon, Lieutenant Adolfo Rojas Silva, was shot and killed in suspicious circumstances. Fort√≠n (Spanish for \\"little fort\\") was the name used for the small pillbox and trench-like garrisons in the Chaco, although the troops' barracks usually were no more than a few mud huts. While the Bolivian government formally regretted the death of Rojas Silva, the Paraguayan public opinion called it \\"murder\\". After the subsequent talks arranged in Buenos Aires failed to produce any agreement and eventually collapsed in January 1928, the dispute grew violent. On 5 December 1928 a Paraguayan cavalry unit overran Fortin Vanguardia, an advance outpost established by the Bolivian army a few miles northwest of Bah√≠a Negra. The Paraguayans captured 21 Bolivian soldiers and burnt the scattered huts to the ground.Farcau, pp. 12‚Äì13 The Bolivians retaliated with an air strike on Bah√≠a Negra on 15 December, which caused few casualties and not much damage. On 14 December Bolivia seized Fortin Boquer√≥n, which later would be the site of the first major battle of the campaign, at the cost of 15 Paraguayan dead. A return to the status quo ante was eventually agreed on 12 September 1929 in Washington, under pressure from the Pan American League, but an arms race had already begun and both countries were on a collision course.Farcau, p. 14 The regular border clashes might have led to war in the 1920s if either side was capable of waging war against one another.Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 416. As it was, neither Paraguay or Bolivia had an arms industry and both sides had to import vast quantities of arms from Europe and the United States to arm themselves for the coming conflict. It was the need for both sides to import sufficient arms that held back the outbreak of the war to 1932, at which point both sides felt capable of resorting to arms to settle the long-running dispute. Map of Chaco War, showing important forts, military outposts, cities and the Paraguayan advance to the west  Composition of the armies  Ford trucks like those used by both armies to resupply their troops The 146km-long railway from the Paraguay river to the heart of the Chaco was vital for the Paraguayan army, especially during the battle of Boquer√≥n Bolivian infantry forces were armed with the latest in foreign weapons, including DWM Maxim M1904 and M1911 machine guns, Czech ZB vz. 26 and Vickers-Berthier light machine guns, Mauser-type Czech VZ-24 7.65mm rifles (mosquetones) and Schmeisser MP-28 II 9mm submachine guns. At the outset, Paraguayan troops used a motley collection of small arms, including German Maxim, British Vickers, and Browning MG38 water-cooled machine guns, and the Danish Madsen light machine gun. The primary service rifle was the M1927 7.65mm Paraguayan Long Rifle, a Mauser design based on the M1909 Argentine Long Rifle and manufactured by the Oviedo arsenal in Spain.Mowbray, Stuart C. and Puleo, Joe, Bolt Action Military Rifles of the World, Andrew Mowbray Publishers, Inc. 1st Ed. (2009), p. 285: After the war, an enterprising arms dealer purchased the remaining M1927 rifles and re-exported them back to Spain, where they were hastily refurbished and re-issued to Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. The M1927 rifle, which tended to overheat in rapid fire, proved highly unpopular with the Paraguyan soldiers. Some M1927 rifles experienced catastrophic receiver failures, a fault later traced to faulty ammunition. After the commencement of hostilities, Paraguay was able to capture sufficient numbers of Bolivian VZ-24 rifles and MP 28 submachine guns (nicknamed piripipi) to equip all her front-line infantry forces. Paraguay had a population only a third as large as that of Bolivia (880,000 vs. 2,150,000), but its innovative style of fighting, centered on rapid marches and flanking encirclements, compared to Bolivia's more conventional strategy, enabled it to take the upper hand. In June 1932 the Paraguayan army totaled about 4,026 men (355 combat officers, 146 surgeons and non-combatant officers, 200 cadets, 690 NCOs and 2,653 soldiers). Both racially and culturally, the Paraguayan army was practically homogeneous. Almost all of its soldiers were European-Guaran√≠ mestizos. Bolivia's army, however, consisted mostly of the Altiplano's aboriginals of Quechua or Aymar√° descent (90% of the infantry troops), the lower-ranking officers were of Spanish or other European ancestry, and the army commander-in-chief Hans Kundt was German. In spite of the fact that the Bolivian army had more manpower, it never mobilized more than 60,000 men, and never more than two-thirds of the army were on the Chaco at any one time. Paraguay, on the other hand, mobilized its entire army.Scheina, Robert L. (2003). \\"Latin America's Wars Volume II: The Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900‚Äì2001.\\" Washington D.C.: Brasseys. A British diplomat reported in 1932 that the average Bolivian had never been anywhere close to the Chaco and \\"had not the slightest expectation of visiting it in the course of his life\\".Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 428. Most Bolivians had little interest in fighting, let alone dying for the Chaco. Furthermore, the typical Bolivian soldier was a Quechua or Aymara peasant conscript accustomed to life high up in the Andes mountains who did not fare well in the low-lying, hot and humid land of the Chaco. Many of Paraguay's army commanders had gained combat experience as volunteers with the French army in World War 1.Fernandez, Col. Carlos Jos√©, La Guerra del Chaco Vols I-IV, La Paz: Impresora Oeste (1956) Paraguay's army commander, Colonel (later General) later Marshal Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia, soon rose to the top of Paraguayan combat command. Estigarribia capitalized on the native Guarani knowledge of the forest and ability to live off the land to gain valuable intelligence on conducting his military campaigns. Estigarribia preferred to bypass Bolivian garrisons and his subordinates, such as Colonel Rafael Franco, proved adept at infiltrating enemy lines, often encirling Bolivian strongholds (Paraguay held over 21,000 POWs by the war's end, against some 2,500 prisoners held by Bolivia). Both sides resorted to entrenched strongpoints using barbed wire, mortars, machineguns, and mines with interlocking fields of fire. Paraguay's war effort was a total one. Buses were commandeered to transport troops, wedding rings were donated to buy weapons, and by 1935 Paraguay had widened conscription to include 17-year-olds and policemen. Perhaps the most important advantage enjoyed by Paraguay was that the Paraguayans had a rail network running to the Chaco comprising five narrow-gauge railroads totaling some 266 miles running from the river ports on the Paraguay river to the Chaco, which allowed the Paraguayan army to bring men and supplies to the front far more effectively than the Bolivians ever managed.Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 435. In 1928 the British Legation in La Paz reported to London that it took the Bolivian Army two weeks to march their men and supplies to the Chaco, and that Bolivia's \\"inordinately long lines of communication\\" would favor Paraguay if war should break out. Furthermore, the drop in altitude from 12,000 feet in the Andes to 500 feet in the Chaco imposed further strain on Bolivia's efforts to supply its soldiers in the Chaco. Bolivia's railroads did not run to the Chaco, and all Bolivian supplies and soldiers had to travel to the front on badly maintained dirt roads. Hughes wrote that the Bolivian elite was well aware of these logistical problems, but throughout the war, Bolivia's leaders had a \\"fatalistic\\" outlook. Bolivia's elite took it for granted that the fact that the Bolivian Army had been trained by a German military mission while the Paraguayan Army had been trained by a French military mission, together with the tough nature of their Quechua and Aymara Indian conscripts and the will to win would give them the edge in the war. A recurring theme in the thinking of Bolivia's elite was that the training provided by the German military mission, the presence of several German officers like Kundt commanding their troops, and sheer willpower and determination were all that was needed for victory. Cavalry forces While both armies deployed a significant number of cavalry regiments, these actually served as infantry, since it was soon learned that the dry Chaco could not provide enough water and forage for horses. Only a relatively few mounted squadrons carried out reconnaissance missions at divisional level.Farcau, p. 185 Armor, artillery, and motorized forces At the insistence of the Minister of War General Hans Kundt, Bolivia purchased a number light tanks and tankettes for support of infantry forces. German instructors provided training to the mostly-Bolivian crews, who received eight weeks' training. The Vickers light tanks bought by Bolivia were the Vickers Type A and Type B, commissioned into the Bolivian army in December 1932, and were originally painted in camouflage patterns. Hampered by the geography and difficult terrain of the Gran Chaco, combined with scarce water sources and inadequate logistical preparations, the Bolivian superiority in vehicles (water-cooled), tanks, and towed artillery in the end did not prove decisive. Thousands of truck and vehicle engines succumbed to the thick Chaco dust, which also jammed the heavy water-cooled machine guns employed by both sides. Having relatively few artillery pieces of its own, Paraguay purchased a quantity of Stokes-Brandt Model 1931 mortars. Highly portable and accurate, with a range of 3,000 yards, the auguas (\\"corn-mashers\\" in Guarani) caused great losses among Bolivian troops. In the course of the conflict, Paraguayan factories developed their own type of hand grenade, the carumbe'i (Guaran√≠ for \\"little turtle\\")Gonz√°lez, Antonio E. (1960). Yas√≠h Rend√≠h. Editorial el Gr√°fico, p.61 Bodies of Paraguayan carumbe'i grenades Museum \\"Villar C√°ceres\\" and produced trailers, mortar tubes, artillery grenades and aerial bombs. The Paraguayan war effort was centralized and led by the state-owned national dockyards, managed by Jos√© Bozzano.Astillero Carmelo de MDF SA Cardozo, Efra√≠m (1964). Hoy en Nuestra Historia. Ed. Nizza, p. 15 The Paraguayan army received the first consignment of carumbe'i grenades in January 1933. Logistics, communications, and intelligence The Paraguayans took advantage of their ability to communicate over the radio in Guaran√≠, a language not spoken by the average Bolivian soldier. Paraguay had little trouble in transporting its army in large barges and gunboats on the Paraguay River to Puerto Casado, and from there directly to the front lines by railway, while the majority of Bolivian troops had to come from the western highlands, some 800 km away and with little or no logistic support. In fact, it took a Bolivian soldier about 14 days to traverse the distance, while a Paraguayan soldier only took about four. The heavy equipment used by Bolivia's army made things even worse. The poor water supply and the dry climate of the region played a key role during the conflict. There were thousands of non-combat casualties due to dehydration, mostly among Bolivian troops.  Air and naval assets  One of the key Paraguayan assets was the gunboat Humait√°, shown here shortly after being launched in Italy, without her main armament. The Chaco War is also important historically as the first instance of large-scale aerial warfare to take place in the Americas. Both sides used obsolete single-engined biplane fighter- bombers; the Paraguayans deployed 14 Potez 25s, while the Bolivians made extensive use of at least 20 CW-14 Ospreys. Despite an international arms embargo imposed by the League of Nations, Bolivia in particular went to great lengths in trying to import a small number of Curtiss T-32 Condor II twin- engined bombers disguised as civil transport planes, but they were stopped in Peru before they could be delivered.Dan Hagedorn and Antonio L. Sapienza, Aircraft of the Chaco War 1928‚Äì1935, Schiffer Publishing Ltd, Atglen PA, 1997, The valuable aerial reconnaissance produced by Bolivia's superior air force in spotting approaching Paraguayan encirclements of Bolivian forces was largely ignored by Kundt and other Bolivian army generals, who tended to dismiss such reports as exaggerations by overzealous airmen.Thompson, R. W., An Echo of Trumpets, London: George Allen and Unwin (1964), pp. 27-64Zook, David H., The Conduct of the Chaco War, New Haven, CT: Bookman Publishing (1960) The Paraguayan navy played a key role in the conflict by carrying thousands of troops and tons of supplies to the front lines via the Paraguay River, as well as by providing anti-aircraft support to transport ships and port facilities. Two Italian-built gunboats, the Humait√° and Paraguay ferried troops to Puerto Casado. On 22 December 1932 three Bolivian Vickers Vespas attacked the Paraguayan riverine outpost of Bah√≠a Negra, on the Paraguay River, killing an army colonel, but one of the aircraft was shot down by the gunboat Tacuary. The two surviving Vespas met another gunboat, the Humait√°, while flying downriver. Paraguayan sources claim that one of them was damaged.Richard, Nicol√°s (2008).

Alas de Bolivia: La Aviaci√≥n Boliviana durante la Campa√±a del Chaco. N/A, p. 181 Although the Paraguayan navy admitted that Humait√° was struck by machine gun fire from the aircraft, they claimed that her armour shield averted damage.Farina, Bernardo Neri (2011).Jos√© Bozzano y la Guerra del Material. Colecci√≥n Protagonistas de la Historia, Editorial El Lector, Online edition, Chapter El Viaje Inolvidable. Shortly before 29 March 1933 a Bolivian Osprey was shot down over the Paraguay River,Hagedorn and Sapienza, p. 21 while on 27 April a strike force of six Ospreys launched a successful mission from their base at Mu√±oz against the logistic riverine base and town of Puerto Casado, although the strong diplomatic reaction of Argentina prevented any further strategic attacks on targets along the Paraguay River.Hagedorn and Sapienza, p. 23 On 26 November 1934 the Brazilian steamer Paraguay was strafed and bombed by mistake by Bolivian aircraft, while sailing the Paraguay River near Puerto Mihanovich. The Brazilian government sent 11 naval planes to the area, and its navy began to convoy shipping on the river.Brazil gets apology for Bolivian attack The New York Times, 29 November 1934Brazilian ship is fired upon Associated Press, 27 November 1934Brazilian boat bombed in Chaco Glasgow Herald, 27 November 1934 The Paraguayan navy air service was also very active in the conflict, harassing Bolivian troops deployed along the northern front with flying boats. The aircraft were moored at Bah√≠a Negra Naval Air Base, and consisted of two Macchi M.18s.Hagedorn & Sapienza, pp. 61‚Äì64 These seaplanes carried out the first night air attack in South America when they raided the Bolivian outposts of Vitriones and San Juan,Scheina, page 102 on 22 December 1934. Every year since then, the Paraguayan navy celebrates the \\"Day of the Naval Air Service\\" on the anniversary of the action.Los Ecos del primer Bombardeo Nocturno en la Guerra del Chaco, Chaco-Re, No. 28 (julio/septiembre 1989), 12‚Äì13. The Bolivian army deployed at least ten locally-built patrol boats and transport vessels during the conflict,Fuerza Naval Boliviana: Rese√±a Hist√≥rica mostly to ship military supplies to the northern Chaco through the Mamor√©-Madeira system.Scheina, Robert L. (1987). Latin America: a naval history, 1810‚Äì1987. Naval Institute Press, p. 124. The transport ships Presidente Saavedra and Presidente Siles steamed on the Paraguay River from 1927 until the beginning of the war, when both units were sold to private companies. The 50-ton armed launch Tahuamanu, based in the Mamor√©-Madeira fluvial system, was briefly transferred to Laguna C√°ceres to ferry troops downriver from Puerto Su√°rez, challenging for eight months the Paraguayan naval presence in Bah√≠a Negra. She was withdrawn to the Itenez River in northern Bolivia after Bolivian aerial reconnaissance revealed the actual strength of the Paraguayan navy in the area.Historial de combate de la patrullera V-01 Tahuamanu. Fuerza Naval Boliviana, Comando Naval, La Paz  Conflict   Pitiantuta Lake incident  Sketch showing the Paraguayan counterattack on Pitiantut√° lake On June 15, 1932, a Bolivian detachment captured and burned to the ground the Fort√≠n Carlos Antonio L√≥pez at Pitiantut√° Lake, disobeying explicit orders by Bolivian President Daniel Salamanca to avoid provocations in the Chaco region. One month later, on July 16, a Paraguayan detachment drove the Bolivian troops from the area. The lake had been already discovered by Paraguayan explorers in March 1931, but the Bolivian High Command was unaware of this when one of its aircraft spotted the lake in April 1932. After the initial incident, Salamanca changed his status quo policy over the disputed area and ordered the outposts of Corrales, Toledo and Boquer√≥n to be captured. The three were soon taken, and in response Paraguay called for a Bolivian withdrawal. Salamanca instead demanded that they be included in a \\"zone of dispute\\". On a memorandum directed to President Salamanca on August 30, Bolivian Gen. Filiberto Osorio expressed his concerns over the lack of a plan of operations, and attached a plan of operations focusing on an offensive from the north. At the same time Bolivian Gen. Quintanilla asked for permission to capture two additional Paraguayan garrisons, Nanawa and Rojas Silva. During August Bolivia slowly reinforced its 4,000-men-strong First Bolivian Army, already in the conflict's zone, with 6,000 men. The breaking of the fragile status quo in the disputed areas of the Chaco by Bolivia convinced Paraguay that a diplomatic solution on agreeable terms was not possible. Paraguay gave its general staff orders to recapture the three forts. During August, Paraguay mobilized over 10,000 troops and sent them into the Chaco region. Paraguayan Lieutenant Colonel Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia prepared for a large offensive before the Bolivians would have mobilized their whole army.  First Paraguayan offensive  Fort√≠n Boquer√≥n was the first target of the Paraguayan offensive. The Boquer√≥n complex, guarded by 619 Bolivian troops, resisted a 22-day siege by a 5,000-man Paraguayan force. An additional 2,500 Bolivians attempted to relieve the siege from the southwest but were beaten back by 2,200 Paraguayans who defended the accesses to the siege area. A few Bolivian units managed to enter Fort√≠n Boquer√≥n with supplies and the Bolivian Air Force dropped food and ammunition to the besieged soldiers. Having begun on 9 September, the siege ended when Fort√≠n Boquer√≥n finally fell on 29 September 1932. After the fall of Fort√≠n Boquer√≥n, the Paraguayans continued their offensive and executed a pincer movement, which forced parts of the Bolivian force to surrender. While the Paraguayans had expected to lay a new siege on Fort√≠n Arce, the most advanced Bolivian outpost in the Chaco, when they got there they found it in ruins. The 4,000 Bolivians who defended Arce had retreated to the southeast to Fort√≠n Alihuat√° and Saveedra.  Bolivian offensive  In December 1932 Bolivian war mobilization had concluded. In terms of weaponry and manpower, its army was ready to overpower the Paraguayans. Gen. Hans Kundt, a former German officer who was a veteran of fighting on the Eastern Front in World War I, was called by President Salamanca to lead the Bolivian counteroffensive. Kundt had served intermittently as military advisor to Bolivia since the beginning of the century and had established good relationships with officers of the Bolivian army and the country's political elites. Vickers 6-ton similar to those deployed by the Bolivian army in the Chaco War The Paraguayan Fort√≠n Nanawa was chosen as the main target of the Bolivian offensive, to be followed by the command centre at Isla Po√≠. Their capture would allow Bolivia to reach the Paraguay River, putting the Paraguayan city of Concepci√≥n in danger. The capture of the fortines of Corrales, Toledo and Fern√°ndez by the Bolivian Second Corps were also part of Kundt's offensive plan. In January 1933 the Bolivian First Corps began its attack on Fort√≠n Nanawa. This stronghold was considered by the Paraguayans to be the backbone of their defenses. It had zig-zag trenches, miles of barbed wire and many machine-gun nests (some embedded in tree trunks). The Bolivian troops had previously stormed the nearby Paraguayan outpost of Mariscal L√≥pez, isolating Nanawa from the south. On January 20, 1933, Kundt, in personal command of the Bolivian force, launched six to nine aircraft and 6,000 unhorsed cavalry, supported by 12 Vickers machine guns. However, the Bolivians failed to capture the fort and instead formed a defensive amphitheater in front of it. The Second Corps managed to capture Fort√≠n Corrales and Fort√≠n Platanillos but failed to take Fort√≠n Fern√°ndez and Fort√≠n Toledo. After a siege that lasted from February 26 to March 11, 1933, the Second Corps aborted its attack on Fort√≠n Toledo and withdrew to a defensive line built 15 km from Fort√≠n Corrales. Paraguayan troops in Fortin Alihuat√°, 1932 After the ill-fated attack on Nanawa and the failures at Fern√°ndez and Toledo, Kundt ordered an assault on Fort√≠n Alihuat√°. The attack on this fort√≠n overwhelmed its few defenders. The capture of Alihuat√° allowed the Bolivians to cut the supply route of the Paraguayan First Division. When the Bolivians were informed of the isolation of the First Division, they launched an attack on it. This attack led to the Battle of Campo Jord√°n, which concluded in the retreat of the Paraguayan First Division to Gondra. In July 1933 Kundt, still focusing on capturing Nanawa, launched a massive frontal attack on the fort√≠n, in what came to be known as the Second Battle of Nanawa. Kundt had prepared for the second attack in detail, using artillery, airplanes, tanks and flamethrowers to overcome Paraguayan fortifications. The Paraguayans, however, had improved existing fortifications and built new ones since the first battle of Nanawa. While the Bolivian two- pronged attack managed to capture parts of the defensive complex, these were soon retaken by Paraguayan counterattacks made by reserves. The Bolivians lost more than 2,000 men injured and killed in the second battle of Nanawa, while Paraguay lost only 559 men injured and dead. The failure to capture Nanawa and the heavy loss of life led President Salamanca to criticize the Bolivian high command, ordering them to spare more men. The defeat seriously damaged Kundt's prestige. In September he resigned his position as commander-in-chief, but his resignation was not accepted by the president. Nanawa was a major turning point in the war, because the Paraguayan army regained the strategic initiative that had belonged to the Bolivians since the beginning of 1933.Farcau, p. 132  Second Paraguayan offensive  Maxim machine gun manned by Paraguayan soldiers In September Paraguay began a new offensive in the form of three separate encirclement movements in the Alihuat√° area, which was chosen because Bolivian forces there had been weakened by the transfer of soldiers to attack Fort√≠n Gondra. As a result of the encirclement campaign, the Bolivian regiments Loa and Ballivi√°n, totaling 509 men, surrendered. The Jun√≠n regiment suffered the same fate, but the Chacaltaya regiment was able to escape encirclement due to intervention of two other Bolivian regiments. The success of the Paraguayan army led Paraguayan President Eusebio Ayala to travel to the Chaco to promote Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia to the rank of general. In that meeting the president approved Estigarribia's new offensive plan. On the other side, the Bolivians gave up their initial plan of reaching the Paraguayan capital of Asunci√≥n and moved on to defensive and attrition warfare. The Paraguayan army executed a large-scale pincer movement against Fort√≠n Alihuat√°, repeating the previous success of these operations. Seven thousand Bolivian troops had to evacuate Fort√≠n Alihuat√°. On December 10, 1933, the Paraguayans finished the encirclement of the 9th and 4th divisions of the Bolivian army. After unsuccessful attempts to break through Paraguayan lines and having suffered 2,600 dead, 7,500 Bolivian soldiers surrendered. Only 900 Bolivian troops led by Major Germ√°n Busch managed to slip away. The Paraguayans obtained 8,000 rifles, 536 machine guns, 25 mortars, two tanks and 20 artillery pieces from the captured Bolivians. By this time, Paraguayan forces had captured so many Bolivian tanks and armored vehicles that Bolivia was forced to purchase Steyr Solothurn 15mm anti-tank rifles in order to fend off their own armor. The remaining Bolivian troops withdrew to their headquarters at Mu√±oz, which was set on fire and evacuated on 18 December. General Kundt resigned as chief of staff of the Bolivian army.  Truce  The massive defeat at Campo de V√≠a forced the Bolivian troops near Fort√≠n Nanawa to withdraw northwest to form a new defensive line. Paraguayan Col. Rafael Franco proposed to launch a new attack against Ballivi√°n and Villa Montes, but was turned down, as Paraguayan President Eusebio Ayala thought Paraguay had already won the war. A 20-day ceasefire was agreed upon between the warring parties on December 19, 1933. On January 6, 1934, when the armistice expired, Bolivia had reorganized its eroded army, having assembled a larger force than the one involved in its first offensive.  Third Paraguayan offensive  By the beginning of 1934 Paraguayan Gen. Estigarribia was planning an offensive against the Bolivian garrison at Puerto Su√°rez, 145 km upriver from Bah√≠a Negra. The Pantanal marshes and the lack of canoes to navigate through them convinced the Paraguayan commander to drop the idea and turn his attention to the main front.Farcau, p. 168 After the armistice's end the Paraguayan army continued its advance, capturing the outposts of Platanillos, Loa, Esteros and Jayucub√°s. After the battle of Campo de V√≠a in December the Bolivian army built up a defensive line at Magari√±os-La China. The Magari√±os-La China line was carefully built and considered to be one of the finest defensive lines of the Chaco War. However, a small Paraguayan attack on February 11, 1934, managed to breach the line, to the surprise of the Paraguayan command, forcing the abandonment of the whole defensive line. A Paraguayan offensive towards Ca√±ada Tarija managed to surround and neutralize 1,000 Bolivian troops on March 27. In May 1934 the Paraguayans detected a gap in the Bolivian defenses that would allow them to isolate the Bolivian stronghold of Ballivi√°n and force its surrender. The Paraguayans worked at night to open a new route in the forests to make the attack possible. When Bolivian reconnaissance aircraft noticed this new path being opened in the forest, a plan was set up to let the Paraguayans enter halfway up the path and then attack them from the rear. The Bolivian operation resulted in the Battle of Ca√±ada Strongest between May 18 and 25. The Bolivians managed to capture 67 Paraguayan officials and 1,389 soldiers. After their defeat at Ca√±ada Strongest the Paraguayans continued their attempts to capture Ballivi√°n. It was considered a key stronghold by the Bolivians, mostly for its symbolic position as the most southeastern Bolivian position left after the second Paraguayan offensive. In November 1934 Paraguayan forces once again managed to surround and neutralize two Bolivian divisions at El Carmen. This disaster forced the Bolivians to abandon Ballivi√°n and form a new defensive line at Villa Montes. On November 27, 1934, Bolivian generals confronted President Salamanca while he was visiting their headquarters in Villa Montes and forced him to resign, replacing him with the Vice President, Jos√© Luis Tejada. On November 9, 1934, the 12,000-man-strong Bolivian Cavalry Corps managed to capture Yrendag√º√© and put the Paraguayan army on the run. Yrendag√º√© was one of the few places with fresh water in that part of the Chaco and, while the Bolivian cavalry was marching towards La Faye from Yrendag√º√©, a Paraguayan force recaptured all the wells in Yrendague so that upon their return the exhausted and thirsty Bolivian troops found themselves without water; the already weakened force fell apart. Many were taken prisoner and a great number of those who avoided capture died of thirst and exposure after wandering aimlessly through the hot, dry forest. The Bolivian Cavalry Corps had previously been considered one of the best units of the new army formed after the armistice.  Last battles  Paraguayan offensive, January 1935. In blue, the Paraguayan advances, and in red, the Bolivian counterattacks After the collapse of the northern and northeastern fronts, Bolivian defenses focused on the south to avoid the fall of their war headquarters/supply base at Villa Montes. The Paraguayans launched an attack towards Ybybob√≥, isolating a portion of the Bolivian forces on the Pilcomayo River. The battle began on 28 December 1934 and lasted until the early days of January 1935. The result was that 200 Bolivian troops were killed and 1,200 surrendered, with the Paraguayans losing only a few dozen men. Some fleeing Bolivian soldiers were reported to have jumped into the fast-flowing waters of the Pilcomayo River to avoid capture. After this defeat the Bolivian army prepared for a last stand at Villa Montes. The loss of that base would allow the Paraguayans to reach the proper Andes. Col. Bernardino Bilbao Rioja and Col. Oscar Moscoso were left in charge of the defenses, after other high-ranking officers declined. On 11 January 1935 the Paraguayans encircled and forced the retreat of two Bolivian regiments. The Paraguayans also managed in January to cut off the road between Villa Montes and Santa Cruz. Paraguayan commander-in-chief Gen. Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia decided then to launch a final assault on Villa Montes. On 7 February 1935 some 5,000 Paraguayans attacked the heavily fortified Bolivian lines near Villa Montes, with the aim of capturing the oilfields at Nancarainza, but they were beaten back by the Bolivian First Cavalry Division. The Paraguayans lost 350 men and were forced to withdraw north toward Boyuib√©. Estigarribia claimed that the defeat was largely due to the mountainous terrain, conditions in which his forces were not used to fighting.Farcau, p. 224-225 On 6 March, Estigarribia again focused all his efforts on the Bolivian oilfields, this time at Camiri, 130 km north of Villa Montes. The commander of the Paraguayan 3rd Corps, Gen. Franco, found a gap between the Bolivian 1st and 18th Infantry regiments and ordered his troops to attack through it, but they became stuck in a salient with no hope of further progress. The Bolivian Sixth Cavalry forced the hasty retreat of Franco's troops in order to avoid being cut off. The Paraguayans lost 84 troops taken prisoner and more than 500 dead were left behind. The Bolivians lost almost 200 men, although‚Äîunlike their exhausted enemies‚Äîthey could afford a long battle of attrition.Farcau, p. 226 On 15 April the Paraguayans punched through the Bolivian lines on the Parapet√≠ River, taking over the city of Charagua. The Bolivian command launched a counter-offensive that forced the Paraguayans back. Although the Bolivian plan fell short of its target of encircling an entire enemy division, they managed to take 475 prisoners on 25 April. On 4 June 1935 a Bolivian regiment was defeated and forced to surrender at Ingavi, in the northern front, after a last attempt at reaching the Paraguay River.Farcau, 229 On 12 June, the day the ceasefire agreement was signed, Paraguayan troops were entrenched only 15 km away from the Bolivian oil fields in Cordillera Province. While the military conflict ended with a comprehensive Paraguayan victory,\\"Paraguayan victory in the Chaco War doubled the national territory and worked wonders for national pride.\\" Chasteen, John Charles (2001). Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America. Norton, p. 176. \\"The architect of the Paraguayan victory was General Estigarribia, who fought a brilliant war of maneuver.\\" Goldstein, Erik (1992). Wars and peace treaties, 1816‚Äì1991. Routledge, p.185. from a wider point of view it was a disaster for both sides. Bolivia's Criollo elite forcibly pressed large numbers of the male indigenous population into the army, even though they felt little or no connection to the nation-state, while Paraguay was able to foment nationalist fervor among its predominantly mixed population. On both sides‚Äîbut more so in the case of Bolivia‚Äîsoldiers were ill-prepared for the dearth of water and the harsh conditions of terrain and weather they encountered. The effects of the lower-altitude climate had seriously impaired the effectiveness of the Bolivian army: most of its indigenous soldiers lived on the cold Altiplano at altitudes of over . They found themselves at a physical disadvantage when called upon to fight in tropical conditions at almost sea level.English, Adrian J. \\"The Green Hell: A Concise History of the Chaco War Between Bolivia and Paraguay 1932‚Äì1935.\\" Gloucestershire: Spellmount Limited, 2007. In fact, of the war's 100,000 casualties‚Äîabout 57,000 of them Bolivian‚Äîmore died from diseases such as malaria and other infections than from combat-related causes. At the same time, the war brought both countries to the brink of economic collapse.  Foreign involvement   Arms embargo and commerce  Since both countries were landlocked, imports of arms and other supplies from outside were limited to what the neighboring countries considered convenient or appropriate. The Bolivian Army was dependent on food supplies that entered southeastern Bolivia from Argentina through Yacu√≠ba.Hughes, Matthew. 2005. Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932‚Äì1935 The army had great difficulty importing arms purchased at Vickers, since both Argentina and Chile were reluctant to let war material pass through their ports. The only remaining options were the port of Mollendo in Peru and Puerto Su√°rez on the Brazilian border. Eventually Bolivia achieved partial success after Vickers managed to persuade the British government to request that Argentina and Chile ease the import restrictions imposed on Bolivia. Internationally, the neighboring countries of Peru, Chile, Brazil and Argentina tried to avoid being accused of fueling the conflict and therefore limited the imports of arms to both Bolivia and Paraguay, although Argentina supported Paraguay behind the neutrality fa√ßade. Paraguay received military supplies, economic assistance and daily intelligence from Argentina throughout the war. The Argentine Army established a special detachment along the border with Bolivia and Paraguay at Formosa in September 1932, called Destacamento Mixto Formosa, in order to deal with deserters from both sides trying to cross into Argentine territory and to prevent any boundary crossing by the warring armies,Gordillo, Gast√≥n and Leguizam√≥n, Juan Mart√≠n (2002). El r√≠o y la frontera: movilizaciones abor√≠genes, obras p√∫blicas y MERCOSUR en el Pilcomayo. Biblos, p. 44. although the cross-border exchange with the Bolivian army was banned only in early 1934, after a formal protest by the Paraguayan government.Gordillo & Leguizam√≥n, p. 45 By the end of the war 15,000 Bolivian soldiers had deserted to Argentina.Casabianca, Ange-Fran√ßois (1999). Una Guerra Desconocida: La Campa√±a del Chaco Boreal (1932‚Äì1935) Editorial El Lector. Some native tribes living on the Argentine bank of the Pilcomayo, like the Wich√≠ and Toba people, were often fired at from the other side of the frontier or strafed by Bolivian aircraft,Gordillo & Leguizam√≥n, p. 43 while a number of members of the Mak√° tribe from Paraguay, led by deserters who had looted a farm on the border and killed some of its inhabitants, were engaged by Argentine forces in 1933.Figallo, Beatriz (2001). Militares e ind√≠genas en el espacio fronterizo chaque√±o. Un escenario de confrontaci√≥n argentino-paraguayo durante el siglo XX. Page 11. The Mak√° had been trained and armed by the Paraguayans for reconnaissance missions.Capdevila, Luc, Combes, Isabel, Richard, Nicol√°s and Barbosa, Pablo (2011). Los hombres transparentes. Ind√≠genas y militares en la guerra del Chaco. p. 97. After the defeat of the Bolivian army at Campo V√≠a, at least one former Bolivian border outpost, Fortin Sorpresa Viejo, was occupied by Argentine troops in December 1933. This led to a minor incident with Paraguayan forces.Campbell Barker, Eugene and Eugene Bolton, Herbert (1951). Southwestern historical quarterly, Volumen 54. Texas State Historical Association in cooperation with the Center for Studies in Texas History, University of Texas at Austin, p. 250Estigarribia, Jos√© F√©lix (1969).The epic of the Chaco: Marshal Estigarribia's memoirs of the Chaco War, 1932‚Äì1935. Greenwood Press, pp. 115 and 118  Advisers and volunteers  Chilean President Arturo Alessandri Palma with his dog Ulk. Alessandri has been suspected of turning a blind eye to the enrollment of Chileans in the Bolivian army. A number of volunteers and hired personnel from different countries participated in the war on both sides. The high command staff of both countries was at times dominated by Europeans. In Bolivia, Gen. Hans Kundt, a German First World War Eastern Front veteran, was in command from the beginning of the war until December 1933, when he was relieved due to a series of military setbacks. Apart from Kundt, Bolivia had also been advised in the last years of the war from a Czechoslovak military mission made of First World War veterans.Farcau, p. 184 The Czechoslovak military mission assisted the Bolivian military after the defeat of Campo V√≠a. Paraguay was getting input from 80 former White Russian officers, including two generals, Nikolai Ern and Ivan Belaieff; the latter was part of Gen. Pyotr Wrangel's staff during the Russian Civil War. In the later phase of the war Paraguay would receive training from a large-scale Italian mission. Bolivia had more than 107 Chileans fighting on its side. Three died from different causes in the last year of the conflict. The Chileans involved in the war enrolled privately and were mostly military and police officers. They were partly motivated by the unemployment caused by both the Great Depression and the political turbulence in Chile in the early 1930s (after the Chaco War ended some of the Chilean officers went on to fight in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War). The arrival of the first group of Chilean combatants in La Paz sparked protests from Paraguay and led the Chilean Congress on 7 September 1934 to approve a law that made it illegal to join the armies of countries at war. This did not, however, stop the enrollment of Chileans in the Bolivian army, and it has been argued that Chilean President Arturo Alessandri Palma secretly approved of the practice in order to get rid of potentially troublesome elements of the military. The enrollment of Chilean military personnel in the Bolivian army caused surprise in Paraguay, since former Chilean president Gen. Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo in 1928 had supported Paraguay after the Bolivian reprisals for the destruction of Fortin Vanguardia. The Paraguayan press denounced the Chilean government as not being neutral and went on to claim that the Chilean soldiers were mercenaries. On 12 August 1934 the Chilean ambassador in Asunci√≥n was recalled back to Santiago in response to official Paraguayan support of the accusations against the Chilean government in the press. Early in the war, however, a few Chilean officers had joined the Paraguayan army. At least two Uruguayan military pilots, Benito S√°nchez Leyton and Luis Tuya, volunteered for some of the most daring missions carried out by Paraguayan Air Force Potez 25s, like the resupply of besieged forces during the Battle of Ca√±ada Strongest and the mass air strike on the Bolivian stronghold of Ballivi√°n on 8 July 1934. During the relief mission on Ca√±ada Strongest, Leyton's Potez n¬∫ 7 managed to come back home despite having been hit by almost 200 rounds.Hagedorn & Sapienza, pp. 34‚Äì35 Argentina was a source of arms and ammunition for Paraguay. The Argentine military attach√© in Asuncion, Col. Schweizer, continued to advise the Paraguayan command well after the start of hostilities. However, the more valuable contribution to the Paraguayan cause came from Argentine military intelligence (G2), led by Col. Esteban Vacareyza, which provided nightly reports on Bolivian movements and supply lines running along the border with Argentina.Farcau, p. 95 Argentine First World War veteran pilot Vicente Almandoz Almonacid was appointed Director of Military Aviation by the Paraguayan government from 1932 to 1933.Vicente Almandoz Almonacid The open Argentine support for Paraguay was also reflected on the battlefield when a number of Argentine citizens, largely from Corrientes and Entre R√≠os, volunteered for the Paraguayan army.Ayala Moreira, Rogelio (1959). Por qu√© no ganamos la Guerra del Chaco. Tall. Gr√°f. Bolivianos, p. 239 Most of them served in the 7th Cavalry Regiment \\"General San Mart√≠n\\" as infantrymen. They fought against the Bolivian Regiments \\"Ingavi\\" and \\"Warnes\\" at the outpost of Corrales on 1 January 1933, where they had a narrow escape after being outnumbered by the Bolivians. The commander of the \\"Warnes\\" Regiment, Lt. Col. S√°nchez, was killed in an ambush set up by the retreating forces, while the volunteers lost seven trucks.Farcau, p. 91 The greatest achievement of \\"San Mart√≠n\\" took place on 10 December 1933, when the First Squadron, led by 2nd Lieutenant Javier Gustavo Schreiber, ambushed and captured the two surviving Bolivian Vickers six-ton tanks on the Alihuat√°-Savedra road, in the course of the battle of Campo V√≠a.Sigal Fogliani, Ricardo (1997). Blindados Argentinos, de Uruguay y Paraguay. Ayer y Hoy, p. 149. A major supporter of Paraguay was the United States Senator and radical populist Huey Long. In a speech on the Senate floor on 30 May 1934, Long claimed the war was the work of \\"the forces of imperialistic finance\\", maintaining that Paraguay was the rightful owner of the Chaco, but that Standard Oil, whom Long called \\"promoter of revolutions in Central America, South America and Mexico\\" had \\"bought\\" the Bolivian government and started the war because Paraguay was unwilling to grant them oil concessions.Gillette, Michael \\"Huey Long and the Chaco War\\" pages 293-311 from Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Volume 11, Issue # 4, Autumn 1970 page 297. Because Long believed that Standard Oil was supporting Bolivia, he was very pro-Paraguayan and in a speech about the war on the Senate floor on 7 June 1934 called Standard Oil \\"domestic murders\\", \\"foreign murders\\", \\"international conspirators\\" and \\"rapacious thieves and robbers\\".Gillette, Michael \\"Huey Long and the Chaco War\\" pages 293-311 from Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Volume 11, Issue # 4, Autumn 1970 pages 300-301. As a result, Long became a national hero in Paraguay and in the summer of 1934, when the Paraguayans captured a Bolivian fort, it was renamed Fort Long in his honour.Gillette, Michael \\"Huey Long and the Chaco War\\" pages 293-311 from Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Volume 11, Issue # 4, Autumn 1970 page 300.  Aftermath  Signatories of the 1938 Peace Treaty gather in Buenos Aires. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated for noon June 10, 1935, Paraguay controlled most of the region. In the last half-hour, there was a senseless shootout between the armies. That was recognized in a 1938 truce, signed in Buenos Aires in Argentina and approved in a referendum in Paraguay, by which Paraguay was awarded three quarters of the Chaco Boreal, . Bolivia was awarded navigation rights on the Paraguay and Paran√° Rivers although it had been provided with such access before the conflict.Glassner, M.I., The Transit Problems Of Landlocked States: the Cases of Bolivia and Paraguay, Ocean Yearbook 4, E.M. Borghese and M. Ginsburg (eds)., Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, pp. 366-389 Two Paraguayans and three Bolivians died for every square mile. Bolivia got the remaining territory that bordered Puerto Busch. The war cost both nations dearly. Bolivia lost between 56,000-65,000 people, comprising 2% of its population while Paraguay lost about 36,000, comprising 3% of its population.Hughes, Matthew \\"Logistics and the Chaco War: Bolivia versus Paraguay, 1932-1935\\" pages 411-437 from The Journal of Military History, Volume 69, Issue # 2 April 2005 page 412. Paraguay captured 21,000 Bolivian soldiers and 10,000 civilians (1% of the Bolivian population); many of the captured civilians chose to remain in Paraguay after the war.de Quesada, Alejandro, The Chaco War 1932‚Äì35: South America‚Äôs Greatest Modern Conflict, Oxford UK: Osprey Publishing Ltd, (2011), p. 22 In addition, 10,000 Bolivian troops, many of them ill-trained and ill-equipped conscripts, deserted to Argentina or injured or mutilated themselves to avoid combat. By the end of hostilities, Paraguay had captured 42,000 rifles, 5,000 machine guns and submachine guns, and 25 million rounds of ammunition from Bolivian forces.Severin, Kurt, Guns In the 'Green Hell' Of The Chaco, Guns Magazine, Nov. 1960, Vol. VI, No. 11-71, pp. 20-22,40-43 Bolivia's stunning military blunders during the Chaco War led to a mass movement, known as the Generaci√≥n del Chaco, away from the traditional order,G√≥mez, Jos√© Luis (1988). Bolivia, un pueblo en busca de su identidad Editorial Los Amigos del Libro, p. 117. which was epitomised by the MNR-led Revolution of 1952. A final document to demarcate the border based on the 1938 border settlement was signed on April 28, 2009, in Buenos Aires.Bolivia, Paraguay Settle Border Conflict from Chaco War Over the succeeding 77 years, no commercial amounts of oil or gas were discovered in the portion of the Chaco awarded to Paraguay, until 26 November 2012, when Paraguayan President Federico Franco announced the discovery of oil in the area of the Pirity river.\\"Paraguay encontr√≥ petr√≥leo cerca de la frontera con la Argentina\\" La Naci√≥n, 26 November 2012 He claimed that \\"in the name of the 30,000 Paraguayans who died in the war,\\" the Chaco would soon be \\"the richest oil zone in South America\\" and \\"the area with the largest amount of oil.\\"\\"Paraguay asegura que tendr√° la regi√≥n petrolera m√°s rica de Sudam√©rica\\" La Naci√≥n, 4 December 2012 In 2014, Paraguay made its first major oil discovery in the Chaco Basin, with the discovery of light oil in the Lapacho X-1 well.President Energy Finds Oil In Paraguay‚Äôs Chaco Basin, Bloomberg News, 20 October 2014, retrieved 30 July 2018 Oil and gas resources extend also from the Villa Montes area and the portion of the Chaco awarded to Bolivia northward along the foothills of the Andes. Today, the fields give Bolivia the second largest resources of natural gas in South America after Venezuela.  Cultural references  Chaco Peace.

As a war reporter for the newspaper El Universal C√©spedes had witnessed the penuries of the war, which he described in Cr√≥nicas heroicas de una guerra est√∫pida (\\"Heroic Chronicles of a stupid war\\") among other books. Several of his fiction works, considered masterworks of the genre, have used the Chaco War conflict as a setting. Another diplomat and important figure of Bolivian literature, Adolfo Costa du Rels, has written about the conflict, his novel Laguna H3 published in 1938 is also set in the Chaco War. One of the masterpieces of Paraguayan writer Augusto Roa Bastos, the 1960 novel Hijo de Hombre, describes in one of its chapters the carnage and harsh war conditions during the siege of Boquer√≥n.

Knowing the operational definition of the agency performing an assessment or giving a diagnosis may help. Persons who speak more than one language or are considered to have an accent in their location of residence do not have a speech disorder if they are speaking in a manner consistent with their home environment or that is a blending of their home and foreign environment.  DSM-IV  According to the DSM-IV-TR, communication disorders are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, though they are not limited as childhood disorders and may persist into adulthood.DSM IV-TR, Rapoport DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders They may also occur with other disorders. Diagnosis involves testing and evaluation during which it is determined if the scores/performance are \\"substantially below\\" developmental expectations and if they \\"significantly\\" interfere with academic achievement, social interactions, and daily living. This assessment may also determine if the characteristic is deviant or delayed. Therefore, it may be possible for an individual to have communication challenges but not meet the criteria of being \\"substantially below\\" criteria of the DSM IV-TR. The DSM diagnoses do not comprise a complete list of all communication disorders, for example, auditory processing disorder is not classified under the DSM or ICD-10. The following diagnoses are included as communication disorders: * Expressive language disorder ‚Äì characterized by difficulty expressing oneself beyond simple sentences and a limited vocabulary. Individuals can better understand than use language; they may have a lot to say, but have more difficulty organizing and retrieving the words than expected for their developmental stage. * Mixed receptive- expressive language disorder ‚Äì problems comprehending the commands of others. * Stuttering ‚Äì a speech disorder characterized by a break in fluency, where sounds, syllables, or words may be repeated or prolonged. * Phonological disorder ‚Äì a speech sound disorder characterized by problems in making patterns of sound errors (e.g., \\"dat\\" for \\"that\\"). * Communication disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) ‚Äì the DSM-IV diagnosis in which disorders that do not meet the specific criteria for the disorder listed above may be classified.  DSM-5  The DSM-5 diagnoses for communication disorders completely rework the ones stated above. The diagnoses are made more general in order to capture the various aspects of communications disorders in a way that emphasizes their childhood onset and differentiate these communications disorders from those associated with other disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorders). *Language disorder ‚Äì the important characteristics of a language disorder are difficulties in learning and using language, which is caused by problems with vocabulary, with grammar, and with putting sentences together in a proper manner. Problems can both be receptive (understanding language) and expressive (producing language). *Speech sound disorder ‚Äì previously called phonological disorder, for those with problems with pronunciation and articulation of their native language.Lee ASY, Gibbon FE. Non-speech oral motor treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD009383. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009383.pub2. * Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) - standard fluency and rhythm of speech is interrupted, often causing the repetition of whole words and syllables. May also include the prolongation of words and syllables; pauses within a word; and/or the avoidance of pronouncing difficult words and replacing them with easier words that the individual is better able to pronounce.American Psychiatric Association. \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition\\". Page 46. This disorder causes many communication problems for the individual and may interfere with social communication and performance in work and/or school settings where communication is essential. * Social (pragmatic) communication disorder ‚Äì this diagnosis described difficulties in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal communication in naturalistic contexts, which affects the development of social relationships and discourse comprehension. The difference between this diagnosis and autism spectrum disorder is that in the latter there is also a restricted or repetitive pattern of behavior. *Unspecified communication disorder ‚Äì for those who have symptoms of a communication disorder but who do not meet all criteria, and whose symptoms cause distress or impairment. Examples Examples of disorders that may include or create challenges in language and communication and/or may co-occur with the above disorders: * autism spectrum disorders - autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS), and Asperger disorder ‚Äì developmental disorders that affect the brain's normal development of social and communication skills. * expressive language disorder ‚Äì affects speaking and understanding where there is no delay in non-verbal intelligence. * mixed receptive-expressive language disorder ‚Äì affects speaking, understanding, reading and writing where there is no delay in non- verbal intelligence. * specific language impairment ‚Äì a language disorder that delays the mastery of language skills in children who have no hearing loss or other developmental delays. SLI is also called developmental language disorder, language delay, or developmental dysphasia. Sensory impairments * Blindness ‚Äì A link between communication skills and visual impairment with children who are blind is currently being investigated. * Deafness/frequent ear infections ‚Äì Trouble with hearing during language acquisition may lead to spoken language problems. Children who suffer from frequent ear infections may temporarily develop problems pronouncing words correctly. Some of the above communication disorders can occur with people who use sign language. The inability to hear is not in itself a communication disorder. Aphasia Aphasia is loss of the ability to produce or comprehend language. There are acute aphasias which result from stroke or brain injury, and primary progressive aphasias caused by progressive illnesses such as dementia. *Acute aphasias Expressive aphasia also known as Broca's aphasia, expressive aphasia is a non-fluent aphasia that is characterized by damage to the frontal lobe region of the brain. A person with expressive aphasia usually speaks in short sentences that make sense but take great effort to produce. Also, a person with expressive aphasia understands another person's speech but has trouble responding quickly. Receptive aphasia also known as Wernicke's aphasia, receptive aphasia is a fluent aphasia that is categorized by damage to the temporal lobe region of the brain. A person with receptive aphasia usually speaks in long sentences that have no meaning or content. People with this type of aphasia often have trouble understanding other's speech and generally do not realize that they are not making any sense. Conduction aphasia Anomic aphasia Global aphasia *Primary progressive aphasias  Progressive nonfluent aphasia Semantic dementia Logopenic progressive aphasia Learning disability * Dyscalculia ‚Äì a defect of the systems used in communicating numbers * Dyslexia ‚Äì a defect of the systems used in reading * Dysgraphia ‚Äì a defect in the systems used in writing Speech disorders *cluttering - a syndrome characterized by a speech delivery rate which is either abnormally fast, irregular, or both. *dysarthria - a condition that occurs when problems with the muscles that helps a person to talk make it difficult to pronounce words. *esophageal voice - involves the patient injecting or swallowing air into the esophagus. Usually learnt and used by patients who cannot use their larynges to speak. Once the patient has forced the air into their esophagus, the air vibrates a muscle and creates esophageal voice. Esophageal voice tends to be difficult to learn and patients are often only able to talk in short phrases with a quiet voice. *lisp - a speech impediment that is also known as sigmatism. *speech sound disorder - Speech-sound disorders (SSD) involve impairments in speech-sound production and range from mild articulation issues involving a limited number of speech sounds to more severe phonologic disorders involving multiple errors in speech-sound production and reduced intelligibility. *stuttering - a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech (called disfluency).

In vertebrates, the inner ear is mainly responsible for sound detection and balance.Torres, M., Gir√°ldez, F. (1998) The development of the vertebrate inner ear. Mechanisms of Development 71 (1-2) pg 5-21 In mammals, it consists of the bony labyrinth, a hollow cavity in the temporal bone of the skull with a system of passages comprising two main functional parts:J.M. Wolfe et al. (2009). Sensation & Perception. 2nd ed. Sunderland: Sinauer Associated Inc * The cochlea, dedicated to hearing; converting sound pressure patterns from the outer ear into electrochemical impulses which are passed on to the brain via the auditory nerve. * The vestibular system, dedicated to balance The inner ear is found in all vertebrates, with substantial variations in form and function. The inner ear is innervated by the eighth cranial nerve in all vertebrates. Structure The cochlea and vestibule, viewed from above. The labyrinth can be divided by layer or by region. Bony and membranous labyrinths The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is the network of passages with bony walls lined with periosteum. The three major parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The membranous labyrinth runs inside of the bony labyrinth, and creates three parallel fluid filled spaces. The two outer are filled with perilymph and the inner with endolymph. Vestibular and cochlear systems In the middle ear, the energy of pressure waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move the tympanic membrane which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. The footplate of the stapes connects to the oval window, the beginning of the inner ear. When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of the tympanic membrane and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain. The vestibular system is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea. The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in view when the head is moved. Joint and muscle receptors are also important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from all these systems to create the sensation of balance. The vestibular system of the inner ear is responsible for the sensations of balance and motion. It uses the same kinds of fluids and detection cells (hair cells) as the cochlea uses, and sends information to the brain about the attitude, rotation, and linear motion of the head. The type of motion or attitude detected by a hair cell depends on its associated mechanical structures, such as the curved tube of a semicircular canal or the calcium carbonate crystals (otolith) of the saccule and utricle. Development The human inner ear develops during week 4 of embryonic development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which gives rise to the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. As the auditory placode invaginates towards the embryonic mesoderm, it forms the auditory vesicle or otocyst. The auditory vesicle will give rise to the utricular and saccular components of the membranous labyrinth. They contain the sensory hair cells and otoliths of the macula of utricle and of the saccule, respectively, which respond to linear acceleration and the force of gravity. The utricular division of the auditory vesicle also responds to angular acceleration, as well as the endolymphatic sac and duct that connect the saccule and utricle. Beginning in the fifth week of development, the auditory vesicle also gives rise to the cochlear duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. The vestibular wall will separate the cochlear duct from the perilymphatic scala vestibuli, a cavity inside the cochlea. The basilar membrane separates the cochlear duct from the scala tympani, a cavity within the cochlear labyrinth. The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the endolymph. The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the cochlear duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti. Microanatomy A cross-section of the cochlea showing the organ of Corti. Cross-section through the spiral organ of Corti at greater magnification. Rosenthal's canal or the spiral canal of the cochlea is a section of the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is approximately 30 mm long and makes 2¬æ turns about the modiolus, the central axis of the cochlea that contains the spiral ganglion. Specialized inner ear cell include: hair cells, pillar cells, Boettcher's cells, Claudius' cells, spiral ganglion neurons, and Deiters' cells (phalangeal cells). The hair cells are the primary auditory receptor cells and they are also known as auditory sensory cells, acoustic hair cells, auditory cells or cells of Corti. The organ of Corti is lined with a single row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells. The hair cells have a hair bundle at the apical surface of the cell. The hair bundle consists of an array of actin-based stereocilia. Each stereocilium inserts as a rootlet into a dense filamentous actin mesh known as the cuticular plate. Disruption of these bundles results in hearing impairments and balance defects. Inner and outer pillar cells in the organ of Corti support hair cells. Outer pillar cells are unique because they are free standing cells which only contact adjacent cells at the bases and apices. Both types of pillar cell have thousands of cross linked microtubules and actin filaments in parallel orientation. They provide mechanical coupling between the basement membrane and the mechanoreceptors on the hair cells. Boettcher's cells are found in the organ of Corti where they are present only in the lower turn of the cochlea. They lie on the basilar membrane beneath Claudius' cells and are organized in rows, the number of which varies between species. The cells interdigitate with each other, and project microvilli into the intercellular space. They are supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. They are named after German pathologist Arthur B√∂ttcher (1831-1889). Claudius' cells are found in the organ of Corti located above rows of Boettcher's cells. Like Boettcher's cells, they are considered supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. They contain a variety of aquaporin water channels and appear to be involved in ion transport. They also play a role in sealing off endolymphatic spaces. They are named after the German anatomist Friedrich Matthias Claudius (1822-1869). Deiters' cells (phalangeal cells) are a type of neuroglial cell found in the organ of Corti and organised in one row of inner phalangeal cells and three rows of outer phalangeal cells. They are the supporting cells of the hair cell area within the cochlea. They are named after the German pathologist Otto Deiters (1834-1863) who described them. Hensen's cells are high columnar cells that are directly adjacent to the third row of Deiters‚Äô cells. Hensen's stripe is the section of the tectorial membrane above the inner hair cell. Nuel's spaces refer to the fluid-filled spaces between the outer pillar cells and adjacent hair cells and also the spaces between the outer hair cells. Hardesty's membrane is the layer of the tectoria closest to the reticular lamina and overlying the outer hair cell region. Reissner's membrane is composed of two cell layers and separates the scala media from the scala vestibuli. Huschke's teeth are the tooth-shaped ridges on the spiral limbus that are in contact with the tectoria and separated by interdental cells.  Blood Supply The bony labyrinth receives its blood supply from three arteries: 1- Anterior tympanic branch (from maxillary artery). 2- Petrosal branch (from middle meningeal artery). 3- Stylomastoid branch (from posterior auricular artery). The membranous labyrinth is supplied by the labyrinthine artery. Venous drainage of the inner ear is through the labyrinthine vein, which empties into the sigmoid sinus or inferior petrosal sinus. Function Neurons within the ear respond to simple tones, and the brain serves to process other increasingly complex sounds. An average adult is typically able to detect sounds ranging between 20 and 20,000 Hz. The ability to detect higher pitch sounds decreases in older humans. The human ear has evolved with two basic tools to encode sound waves; each is separate in detecting high and low-frequency sounds. Georg von B√©k√©sy (1899-1972) employed the use of a microscope in order to examine the basilar membrane located within the inner-ear of cadavers. He found that movement of the basilar membrane resembles that of a traveling wave; the shape of which varies based on the frequency of the pitch. In low-frequency sounds, the tip (apex) of the membrane moves the most, while in high-frequency sounds, the base of the membrane moves most. Disorders Interference with or infection of the labyrinth can result in a syndrome of ailments called labyrinthitis. The symptoms of labyrinthitis include temporary nausea, disorientation, vertigo, and dizziness. Labyrinthitis can be caused by viral infections, bacterial infections, or physical blockage of the inner ear. Another condition has come to be known as autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). It is characterized by idiopathic, rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. It is a fairly rare disorder while at the same time, a lack of proper diagnostic testing has meant that its precise incidence cannot be determined.Ruckenstein, M. J. (2004). \\"Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease\\". Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery, 12(5), pp. 426-430. Other animals Birds have an auditory system similar to that of mammals, including a cochlea. Reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have cochleas but hear with simpler auditory organs or vestibular organs, which generally detect lower- frequency sounds than the cochlea. The cochlea of birds is similar to that of crocodiles, consisting of a short, slightly curved bony tube within which lies the basilar membrane with its sensory structures. The cochlear system In reptiles, sound is transmitted to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening on the surface of the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule. In most reptiles the perilymphatic duct and lagena are relatively short, and the sensory cells are confined to a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying along one side. The first half of the duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the scala tympani. As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. All of these structures together constitute the cochlea. In mammals (other than monotremes), the cochlea is extended still further, becoming a coiled structure in order to accommodate its length within the head. The organ of Corti also has a more complex structure in mammals than it does in other amniotes. The arrangement of the inner ear in living amphibians is, in most respects, similar to that of reptiles. However, they often lack a basilar papilla, having instead an entirely separate set of sensory cells at the upper edge of the saccule, referred to as the papilla amphibiorum, which appear to have the same function. Although many fish are capable of hearing, the lagena is, at best, a short diverticulum of the saccule, and appears to have no role in sensation of sound. Various clusters of hair cells within the inner ear may instead be responsible; for example, bony fish contain a sensory cluster called the macula neglecta in the utricle that may have this function. Although fish have neither an outer nor a middle ear, sound may still be transmitted to the inner ear through the bones of the skull, or by the swim bladder, parts of which often lie close by in the body. The vestibular system By comparison with the cochlear system, the vestibular system varies relatively little between the various groups of jawed vertebrates. The central part of the system consists of two chambers, the saccule and utricle, each of which includes one or two small clusters of sensory hair cells. All jawed vertebrates also possess three semicircular canals arising from the utricle, each with an ampulla containing sensory cells at one end. An endolymphatic duct runs from the saccule up through the head and ending close to the brain. In cartilaginous fish, this duct actually opens onto the top of the head, and in some teleosts, it is simply blind-ending. In all other species, however, it ends in an endolymphatic sac. In many reptiles, fish, and amphibians this sac may reach considerable size. In amphibians the sacs from either side may fuse into a single structure, which often extends down the length of the body, parallel with the spinal canal. The primitive lampreys and hagfish, however, have a simpler system. The inner ear in these species consists of a single vestibular chamber, although in lampreys, this is associated with a series of sacs lined by cilia. Lampreys have only two semicircular canals, with the horizontal canal being absent, while hagfish have only a single, vertical, canal. Equilibrium The inner ear is primarily responsible for balance, equilibrium and orientation in three-dimensional space. The inner ear can detect both static and dynamic equilibrium. Three semicircular ducts and two chambers, which contain the saccule and utricle, enable the body to detect any deviation from equilibrium. The macula sacculi detects vertical acceleration while the macula utriculi is responsible for horizontal acceleration. These microscopic structures possess stereocilia and one kinocilium which are located within the gelatinous otolithic membrane. The membrane is further weighted with otoliths. Movement of the stereocilia and kinocilium enable the hair cells of the saccula and utricle to detect motion. The semicircular ducts are responsible for detecting rotational movement.Anatomy & Physiology The Unity of Form and Function. N.p.: McGraw-Hill College, 2011. Print.

The mammalian middle ear contains three ossicles, which transfer the vibrations of the eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear. The hollow space of the middle ear is also known as the tympanic cavity and is surrounded by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The auditory tube (also known as the Eustachian tube or the pharyngotympanic tube) joins the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), allowing pressure to equalize between the middle ear and throat. The primary function of the middle ear is to efficiently transfer acoustic energy from compression waves in air to fluid‚Äìmembrane waves within the cochlea. Structure Ossicles The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles: malleus, incus, and stapes. The ossicles were given their Latin names for their distinctive shapes; they are also referred to as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, respectively. The ossicles directly couple sound energy from the eardrum to the oval window of the cochlea. While the stapes is present in all tetrapods, the malleus and incus evolved from lower and upper jaw bones present in reptiles. The ossicles are classically supposed to mechanically convert the vibrations of the eardrum into amplified pressure waves in the fluid of the cochlea (or inner ear), with a lever arm factor of 1.3. Since the effective vibratory area of the eardrum is about 14 fold larger than that of the oval window, the sound pressure is concentrated, leading to a pressure gain of at least 18.1. The eardrum is merged to the malleus, which connects to the incus, which in turn connects to the stapes. Vibrations of the stapes footplate introduce pressure waves in the inner ear. There is a steadily increasing body of evidence that shows that the lever arm ratio is actually variable, depending on frequency. Between 0.1 and 1 kHz it is approximately 2, it then rises to around 5 at 2 kHz and then falls off steadily above this frequency. The measurement of this lever arm ratio is also somewhat complicated by the fact that the ratio is generally given in relation to the tip of the malleus (also known as the umbo) and the level of the middle of the stapes. The eardrum is actually attached to the malleus handle over about a 0.5 cm distance. In addition, the eardrum itself moves in a very chaotic fashion at frequencies >3 kHz. The linear attachment of the eardrum to the malleus actually smooths out this chaotic motion and allows the ear to respond linearly over a wider frequency range than a point attachment. The auditory ossicles can also reduce sound pressure (the inner ear is very sensitive to overstimulation), by uncoupling each other through particular muscles. The middle ear efficiency peaks at a frequency of around 1 kHz. The combined transfer function of the outer ear and middle ear gives humans a peak sensitivity to frequencies between 1 kHz and 3 kHz. Muscles The movement of the ossicles may be stiffened by two muscles. The stapedius muscle, the smallest skeletal muscle in the body, connects to the stapes and is controlled by the facial nerve; the tensor tympani muscle is attached to the upper end of the medial surface of the handle of malleus and is under the control of the medial pterygoid nerve which is a branch of the mandibular nerve of the trigeminal nerve. These muscles contract in response to loud sounds, thereby reducing the transmission of sound to the inner ear. This is called the acoustic reflex. Nerves Of surgical importance are two branches of the facial nerve that also pass through the middle ear space. These are the horizontal portion of the facial nerve and the chorda tympani. Damage to the horizontal branch during ear surgery can lead to paralysis of the face (same side of the face as the ear). The chorda tympani is the branch of the facial nerve that carries taste from the ipsilateral half (same side) of the tongue. Function Sound transfer Ordinarily, when sound waves in air strike liquid, most of the energy is reflected off the surface of the liquid. The middle ear allows the impedance matching of sound traveling in air to acoustic waves traveling in a system of fluids and membranes in the inner ear. This system should not be confused, however, with the propagation of sound as compression waves in liquid. The middle ear couples sound from air to the fluid via the oval window, using the principle of \\"mechanical advantage\\" in the form of the \\"hydraulic principle\\" and the \\"lever principle\\". The vibratory portion of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) is many times the surface area of the footplate of the stapes (the third ossicular bone which attaches to the oval window); furthermore, the shape of the articulated ossicular chain is like a lever, the long arm being the long process of the malleus, the fulcrum being the body of the incus, and the short arm being the lenticular process of the incus. The collected pressure of sound vibration that strikes the tympanic membrane is therefore concentrated down to this much smaller area of the footplate, increasing the force but reducing the velocity and displacement, and thereby coupling the acoustic energy. The middle ear is able to dampen sound conduction substantially when faced with very loud sound, by noise- induced reflex contraction of the middle-ear muscles. Clinical significance The middle ear is hollow. In a high-altitude environment or on diving into water, there will be a pressure difference between the middle ear and the outside environment. This pressure will pose a risk of bursting or otherwise damaging the tympanum if it is not relieved. If middle ear pressure remains low, the eardrum may become retracted into the middle ear . One of the functions of the Eustachian tubes that connect the middle ear to the nasopharynx is to help keep middle ear pressure the same as air pressure. The Eustachian tubes are normally pinched off at the nose end, to prevent being clogged with mucus, but they may be opened by lowering and protruding the jaw; this is why yawning or chewing helps relieve the pressure felt in the ears when on board an aircraft. Otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear. Infections Recent findings indicate that the middle ear mucosa could be subjected to human papillomavirus infection. Indeed, DNAs belonging to oncogenic HPVs, i.e., HPV16 and HPV18, have been detected in normal middle ear specimens, thereby underling that the normal middle ear mucosa could potentially be a target tissue for HPV infection. Other animals The middle ear of tetrapods is analogous with the spiracle of fishes, an opening from the pharynx to the side of the head in front of the main gill slits. In fish embryos, the spiracle forms as a pouch in the pharynx, which grows outward and breaches the skin to form an opening; in most tetrapods, this breach is never quite completed, and the final vestige of tissue separating it from the outside world becomes the eardrum. The inner part of the spiracle, still connected to the pharynx, forms the eustachian tube. In reptiles, birds, and early fossil tetrapods, there is a single auditory ossicle, the columella (that is homologous with the stapes, or \\"stirrup\\" of mammals). This is connected indirectly with the eardrum via a mostly cartilaginous extracolumella and medially to the inner-ear spaces via a widened footplate in the fenestra ovalis. The columella is an evolutionary derivative of the bone known as the hyomandibula in fish ancestors, a bone that supported the skull and braincase. The structure of the middle ear in living amphibians varies considerably and is often degenerate. In most frogs and toads, it is similar to that of reptiles, but in other amphibians, the middle ear cavity is often absent. In these cases, the stapes either is also missing or, in the absence of an eardrum, connects to the quadrate bone in the skull, although, it is presumed, it still has some ability to transmit vibrations to the inner ear. In many amphibians, there is also a second auditory ossicle, the operculum (not to be confused with the structure of the same name in fishes). This is a flat, plate-like bone, overlying the fenestra ovalis, and connecting it either to the stapes or, via a special muscle, to the scapula. It is not found in any other vertebrates. Mammals are unique in having evolved a three-ossicle middle-ear independently of the various single-ossicle middle ears of other land vertebrates, all during the Triassic period of geological history. Functionally, the mammalian middle ear is very similar to the single-ossicle ear of non-mammals, except that it responds to sounds of higher frequency, because these are better taken up by the inner ear (which also responds to higher frequencies than those of non-mammals). The malleus, or \\"hammer\\", evolved from the articular bone of the lower jaw, and the incus, or \\"anvil\\", from the quadrate. In other vertebrates, these bones form the primary jaw joint, but the expansion of the dentary bone in mammals led to the evolution of an entirely new jaw joint, freeing up the old joint to become part of the ear. For a period of time, both jaw joints existed together, one medially and one laterally. The evolutionary process leading to a three-ossicle middle ear was thus an \\"accidental\\" byproduct of the simultaneous evolution of the new, secondary jaw joint. In many mammals, the middle ear also becomes protected within a cavity, the auditory bulla, not found in other vertebrates. A bulla evolved late in time and independently numerous times in different mammalian clades, and it can be surrounded by membranes, cartilage or bone. The bulla in humans is part of the temporal bone.

Structure Auricle The visible part is called the auricle, also known as the pinna, especially in other animals. It is composed of a thin plate of yellow elastic cartilage, covered with integument, and connected to the surrounding parts by ligaments and muscles; and to the commencement of the ear canal by fibrous tissue. Many mammals can move the pinna (with the auriculares muscles) in order to focus their hearing in a certain direction in much the same way that they can turn their eyes. Most humans do not have this ability. http://www.livescience.com/33809-wiggle-ears.html Ear canal From the pinna, the sound waves move into the ear canal (also known as the external acoustic meatus) a simple tube running through to the middle ear. This tube leads inward from the bottom of the auricula and conducts the vibrations to the tympanic cavity and amplifies frequencies in the range 3 kHz to 12 kHz. Muscles =Intrinsic muscles= The intrinsic muscles of the external ear are: * The helicis major is a narrow vertical band situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises below, from the spina helicis, and is inserted into the anterior border of the helix, just where it is about to curve backward. * The helicis minor is an oblique fasciculus, covering the crus helicis. * The tragicus is a short, flattened vertical band on the lateral surface of the tragus. Also known as the mini lobe. * The antitragicus arises from the outer part of the antitragus, and is inserted into the cauda helicis and antihelix. * The transverse muscle is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of scattered fibers, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the eminentia conchae to the prominence corresponding with the scapha. * The oblique muscle also on the cranial surface, consists of a few fibers extending from the upper and back part of the concha to the convexity immediately above it. =Extrinsic muscles= The auricular muscles (or extrinsic muscles) are the three muscles surrounding the auricula or outer ear: * anterior auricular muscle * superior auricular muscle * posterior auricular muscle The superior muscle is the largest of the three, followed by the posterior and the anterior. In some mammals these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans these muscles possess very little action. The auricularis anterior draws the auricula forward and upward; the Auricularis superior slightly raises it; and the Auricularis posterior draws it backward. Function One consequence of the configuration of the outer ear is selectively to boost the sound pressure 30- to 100-fold for frequencies around 3 kHz. This amplification makes humans most sensitive to frequencies in this range ‚Äî and also explains why they are particularly prone to acoustical injury and hearing loss near this frequency. Most human speech sounds are also distributed in the bandwidth around 3 kHz. Clinical significance Malformations of the external ear can be a consequence of hereditary disease, or exposure to environmental factors such as radiation, infection. Such defects include: *A preauricular fistula, which is a long narrow tube, usually near the tragus. This can be inherited as an autosomal recessive fashion and may suffer from chronic infection in later life. * Cosmetic defects, such as very large ears, small ears. * Malformation that may lead to functional impairment, such as atresia of the external auditory meatus or aplasia of the pinna, * Genetic syndromes, which include: Konigsmark syndrome, characterised by small ears and atresia of the external auditory canal, causing conductive hearing loss and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  Goldenhar syndrome, a combination of developmental abnormalities affecting the ears, eyes, bones of the skull, and vertebrae, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treacher Collins syndrome, characterised by dysplasia of the auricle, atresia of the bony part of the auditory canal, hypoplasia of the auditory ossicles and tympanic cavity, and 'mixed' deafness (both sensorineural and conductive), inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Crouzon syndrome, characterised by bilateral atresia of the external auditory canal, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. . Surgery Usually, malformations are treated with surgery, although artificial prostheses are also sometimes used. *Preauricular fistulas are generally not treated unless chronically inflamed. *Cosmetic defects without functional impairment are generally repaired after ages 6‚Äì7. If malformations are accompanied by hearing loss amenable to correction, then the early use of hearing aids may prevent complete hearing loss.

Overview Most often, the makefile directs Make on how to compile and link a program. A makefile works upon the principle that files only need recreating if their dependencies are newer than the file being created/recreated. The makefile is recursively carried out (with dependency prepared before each target depending upon them) until everything has been updated (that requires updating) and the primary/ultimate target is complete. These instructions with their dependencies are specified in a makefile. If none of the files that are prerequisites have been changed since the last time the program was compiled, no actions take place. For large software projects, using Makefiles can substantially reduce build times if only a few source files have changed. Using C/C++ as an example, when a C/C++ source file is changed, it must be recompiled. If a header file has changed, each C/C++ source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable program. Operating system Unix-like Makefiles originated on Unix- like systems and are still a primary software build mechanism in such environments. Microsoft Windows Windows supports a variation of makefiles with its nmake utility. Standard Unix-like makefiles can be executed in Windows in a Cygwin environment or Mingw. Contents Makefiles contain five kinds of things: explicit rules, implicit rules, variable definitions, directives, and comments. *An explicit rule says when and how to remake one or more files, called the rule's targets. It lists the other files that the targets depend on, called the prerequisites of the target, and may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets. *An implicit rule says when and how to remake a class of files based on their names. It describes how a target may depend on a file with a name similar to the target and gives a recipe to create or update such a target. *A variable definition is a line that specifies a text string value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later. *A directive is an instruction for make to do something special while reading the makefile such as reading another makefile. *‚Äò#‚Äô in a line of a makefile starts a comment. It and the rest of the line is ignored. Rules A makefile consists of ‚Äúrules‚Äù in the following form: target: dependencies system command(s) A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as \\"clean\\". A dependency (also called prerequisite) is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files. However, the rule that specifies a recipe for the target need not have any prerequisites. For example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the target \\"clean\\" does not have prerequisites. The system command(s) (also called recipe) is an action that make carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line. Note the use of meaningful indentation in specifying commands; also note that the indentation must consist of a single character. Execution A makefile is executed with the make command, e.g. make [options] [target1 target2 ...]. By default, when make looks for the makefile, if a makefile name was not included as a parameter, it tries the following names, in order: makefile and Makefile. Example Here is a makefile that describes the way an executable file called edit depends on four object files which, in turn, depend on four C source and two header files. To be concrete, is a target, , , and are the objects we link to make the executable, and are headers that our objects need to compile correctly, and is a system command. * is a macro that refers to the target * is a macro that refers to the first dependency * is a macro that refers to all dependencies * is a macro to make a pattern that we want to watch in both the target and the dependency The make file will recompile all objects if any of the headers change, but if an individual file changes, the only work that will need to be done is to recompile that file and then relink all the objects. Well written make rules can help reduce compile time by detecting what did and did not change Notice the way the variables and static pattern rules are used to make the makefile more extensible and readable. We define the same, reusable rule to make each from each , and to make each from the objects. Also notice that we can only link one main at a time, so we have to filter out other mains at linking. The targets and are named because they don't refer to real files, but are things we want make to do.

It likely originated in the Indian subcontinent, but is now found worldwide. The black rat is black to light brown in colour with a lighter underside. It is a generalist omnivore and a serious pest to farmers because it feeds on a wide range of agricultural crops. It is sometimes kept as a pet. In parts of India, it is considered sacred and respected in the Karni Mata Temple in Deshnoke. Taxonomy Mus rattus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the black rat. Three subspecies were once recognized, but today are considered invalid: *Rattus rattus rattus ‚Äì roof rat *Rattus rattus alexandrinus ‚Äì Alexandrine rat *Rattus rattus frugivorus ‚Äì fruit rat Characteristics Black rat skull Comparison of the physique of a black rat (Rattus rattus) with a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) Black rat skeleton (Museum of Osteology) A typical adult black rat is long, not including a tail, and weighs , depending on the subspecies.Schwartz, Charles Walsh and Schwartz, Elizabeth Reeder (2001). The Wild Mammals of Missouri, University of Missouri Press, , p. 250.Engels, Donald W. (1999). Classical Cats: The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat, Routledge, , p. 16. Despite its name, the black rat exhibits several colour forms. It is usually black to light brown in colour with a lighter underside. In England during the 1920s, several variations were bred and shown alongside domesticated brown rats. This included an unusual green-tinted variety.Alderton, D. (1996). Rodents of the World. Diane Publishing Company. The black rat also has a scraggly coat of black fur, and is slightly smaller than the brown rat. Origin Black rat bone remains dating to the Norman period were discovered in Britain. The black rat occurred in prehistoric Europe and in the Levant during postglacial periods. The specific origin of the black rat is uncertain due to its disappearance and reintroduction. Evidence such as DNA and bone fragments also indicate that it did not originate in Europe, but migrated from Southeast Asia, possibly Malaysia. It probably spread across Europe in the wake of the Roman conquest. Possibly, speciation occurred when it colonized southwest India, which was the primary country from which Romans obtained their spices. Since the black rat is a passive traveler, it could have easily traveled to Europe during the trading between Rome and Southwest Asian countries. The black rat in the Mediterranean differs genetically from its Southeast Asian ancestor by having 38 instead of 42 chromosomes. It is a resilient vector for many diseases because of its ability to hold so many infectious bacteria in its blood. It played a primary role in spreading bacteria contained in fleas on its body, such as Yersinia pestis, which is responsible for the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death. A study published in 2015 indicates that other Asiatic rodents served as plague reservoirs, from which infections spread as far west as Europe via trade routes, both overland and maritime. Although the black rat was certainly a plague vector in European ports, the spread of the plague beyond areas colonized by rats suggests that the plague was also circulated by humans after reaching Europe. Diet Black rats are considered omnivores and eat a wide range of foods, including seeds, fruit, stems, leaves, fungi, and a variety of invertebrates and vertebrates. They are generalists, and thus not very specific in their food preferences, which is indicated by their tendency to feed on any meal provided for cows, swine, chickens, cats, and dogs. They are similar to the tree squirrel in their preference of fruits and nuts. They eat about per day and drink about per day. Their diet is high in water content. They are a threat to many natural habitats because they feed on birds and insects. They are also a threat to many farmers, since they feed on a variety of agricultural-based crops, such as cereals, sugar cane, coconuts, cocoa, oranges, and coffee beans. Distribution and habitat The black rat originated in India and Southeast Asia, and spread to the Near East and Egypt, and then throughout the Roman Empire, reaching Great Britain as early as the 1st century AD. Europeans subsequently spread it throughout the world. The black rat is again largely confined to warmer areas, having been supplanted by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in cooler regions and urban areas. In addition to the brown rat being larger and more aggressive, the change from wooden structures and thatched roofs to bricked and tiled buildings favored the burrowing brown rats over the arboreal black rats. In addition, brown rats eat a wider variety of foods, and are more resistant to weather extremes. Black rat populations can increase exponentially under certain circumstances, perhaps having to do with the timing of the fruiting of the bamboo plant, and cause devastation to the plantings of subsistence farmers; this phenomenon is known as Mautam in parts of India. Black rats are thought to have arrived in Australia with the First Fleet, and subsequently spread to many coastal regions in the country. Black rats adapt to a wide range of habitats. In urban areas they are found around warehouses, residential buildings, and other human settlements. They are also found in agricultural areas, such as in barns and crop fields. In urban areas, they prefer to live in dry upper levels of buildings, so they are commonly found in wall cavities and false ceilings. In the wild, black rats live in cliffs, rocks, the ground, and trees. They are great climbers and prefer to live in palms and trees, such as pine trees. Their nests are typically spherical and made of shredded material, including sticks, leaves, other vegetation, and cloth. In the absence of palms or trees, they can burrow into the ground. Black rats are also found around fences, ponds, riverbanks, streams, and reservoirs. Behaviour and ecology Home range refers to the area in which an animal travels and spends most of its time. It is thought that male and female rats have similar sized home ranges during the winter, but male rats increase the size of their home range during the breeding season. Along with differing between rats of different sex, home range also differs depending on the type of forest in which the black rat inhabits. For example, home ranges in the southern beech forests of the South Island, New Zealand appear to be much larger than the non-beech forests of the North Island. Due to the limited number of rats that are studied in home range studies, the estimated sizes of rat home ranges in different rat demographic groups are inconclusive. Nesting behaviour Through the usage of tracking devices such as radio transmitters, rats have been found to occupy dens located in trees, as well as on the ground. In Puketi Forest in the Northland Region of New Zealand, rats have been found to form dens together. Rats appear to den and forage in separate areas in their home range depending on the availability of food resources. Research shows that, in New South Wales, the black rat prefers to inhabit lower leaf litter of forest habitat. There is also an apparent correlation between the canopy height and logs and the presence of black rats. This correlation may be a result of the distribution of the abundance of prey as well as available refuges for rats to avoid predators. As found in North Head, New South Wales, there is positive correlation between rat abundance, leaf litter cover, canopy height, and litter depth. All other habitat variables showed little to no correlation. While this species' relative, the brown (Norway) rat prefers to nest near the ground of a building the black rat will prefer the upper floors and roof. Because of this habit they have been given the common name roof rat. Foraging behaviour The black rat displays flexibility in its foraging behaviour. It is a predatory species and adapts to different micro-habitats. It often meets and forages together in close proximity within and between sexes. It tends to forage after sunset. If the food cannot be eaten quickly, it searches for a place to carry and hoard to eat at a later time. Although it eats a broad range of foods, it is a highly selective feeder; only a restricted selection of the foods is dominating. When offered a wide diversity of foods, it eats only a small sample of each. This allows to monitoring the quality of foods that are present year round, such as leaves, as well as seasonal foods, such as herbs and insects. This method of operating on a set of foraging standards ultimately determines the final composition of its meals. Also, by sampling the available food in an area, it maintains a dynamic food supply, balance its nutrient intake, and avoids intoxication by secondary compounds. Diseases Black rats (or their ectoparasites) can carry a number of pathogens, of which bubonic plague (via the Oriental rat flea), typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis are the best known. It has been hypothesized that the displacement of black rats by brown rats led to the decline of the Black Death.Last, John M. \\"Black Death\\", Encyclopedia of Public Health, eNotes website. Retrieved 31 December 2010.Barnes, Ethne (2007). Diseases and Human Evolution, University of New Mexico Press, , p. 247. This theory has, however, been deprecated, as the dates of these displacements do not match the increases and decreases in plague outbreaks.Bollet, Alfred J. (2004). Plagues & Poxes: The Impact of Human History on Epidemic Disease, Demos Medical Publishing, 2004, , p. 23Carrick, Tracy Hamler; Carrick, Nancy and Finsen, Lawrence (1997). The Persuasive Pen: An Integrated Approach to Reasoning and Writing, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 1997, , p. 162.Hays, J. N. (2005). Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History, ABC-CLIO, , p. 64. Rats serve as outstanding vectors for transmittance of diseases because they can carry bacteria and viruses in their systems. A number of bacterial diseases are common to rats, and these include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutsheri, Bacillus piliformis, Pasteurella pneumotropica, and Streptobacillus moniliformis, to name a few. All of these bacteria are disease causing agents in humans. In some cases, these diseases are incurable. Predators The black rat is prey to cats and owls in domestic settings. In less urban settings, rats are preyed on by weasels, foxes, and coyotes. These predators have little effect on the control of the black rat population because black rats are agile and fast climbers. In addition to agility, the black rat also uses its keen sense of hearing to detect danger and quickly evade mammalian and avian predators. As an invasive species Damage caused After Rattus rattus was introduced into the northern islands of New Zealand, they fed on the seedlings adversely affecting the ecology of the islands. Even after eradication of R. rattus, the negative effects may take decades to reverse. When consuming these seabirds and seabird eggs, these rats reduce the pH of the soil. This harms plant species by reducing nutrient availability in soil, thus decreasing the probability of seed germination. For example, research conducted by Hoffman et al. indicates a large impact on 16 indigenous plant species directly preyed on by R. rattus. These plants displayed a negative correlation in germination and growth in the presence of black rats. Rats prefer to forage in forest habitats. In the Ogasawara islands, they prey on the indigenous snails and seedlings. Snails that inhabit the leaf litter of these islands showed a significant decline in population on the introduction of Rattus rattus. The black rat shows a preference for snails with larger shells (greater than 10 mm), and this led to a great decline in the population of snails with larger shells. A lack of prey refuges makes it more difficult for the snail to avoid the rat. Complex pest The black rat is a complex pest, defined as one that influences the environment in both harmful and beneficial ways. In many cases, after the black rat is introduced into a new area, the population size of some native species declines or goes extinct. This is because the black rat is a good generalist with a wide dietary niche and a preference for complex habitats; this causes strong competition for resources among small animals. This has led to the black rat completely displacing many native species in Madagascar, the Galapagos, and the Florida Keys. In a study by Stokes et al., habitats suitable for the native bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, of Australia are often invaded by the black rat and are eventually occupied by only the black rat. When the abundances of these two rat species were compared in different micro-habitats, both were found to be affected by micro-habitat disturbances, but the black rat was most abundant in areas of high disturbance; this indicates it has a better dispersal ability. Despite the black rat's tendency to displace native species, it can also aid in increasing species population numbers and maintaining species diversity. The bush rat, a common vector for spore dispersal of truffles, has been extirpated from many micro-habitats of Australia. In the absence of a vector, the diversity of truffle species would be expected to decline. In a study in New South Wales, Australia it was found that, although the bush rat consumes a diversity of truffle species, the black rat consumes as much of the diverse fungi as the natives and is an effective vector for spore dispersal. Since the black rat now occupies many of the micro-habitats that were previously inhabited by the bush rat, the black rat plays an important ecological role in the dispersal of fungal spores. By eradicating the black rat populations in Australia, the diversity of fungi would decline, potentially doing more harm than good. Control methods Large-scale rat control programs have been taken to maintain a steady level of the invasive predators in order to conserve the native species in New Zealand such as kokako and mohua. Pesticides, such as pindone and 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate), are commonly distributed via aerial spray by helicopter as a method of mass control on islands infested with invasive rat populations. Bait, such as brodifacoum, is also used along with coloured dyes (used to deter birds from eating the baits) in order to kill and identify rats for experimental and tracking purposes. Another method to track rats is the use of wired cage traps, which are used along with bait, such as rolled oats and peanut butter, to tag and track rats to determine population sizes through methods like mark-recapture and radio-tracking. Tracking tunnels (coreflute tunnels containing an inked card) are also commonly used monitoring devices, as are chew-cards containing peanut butter. Poison control methods are effective in reducing rat populations to nonthreatening sizes, but rat populations often rebound to normal size within months. Besides their highly adaptive foraging behavior and fast reproduction, the exact mechanisms for their rebound is unclear and are still being studied. In 2010, the Sociedad Ornitol√≥gica Puertorrique√±a (Puerto Rican Bird Society) and the Ponce Yacht and Fishing Club launched a campaign to eradicate the black rat from the Isla Ratones (Mice Island) and Isla Cardona (Cardona Island) islands off the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico.Wege, David (4 August 2010) Restauran h√°bitat del lagartijo del seco Anolis cooki en la Isla de Cardona y Cayo Ratones. birdlife.org. Decline in population Rattus rattus populations were common in Great Britain, but began to decline after the introduction of the brown rat in the 18th century. R. rattus populations remained common in seaports and major cities until the late 19th century, but have been decreased due to rodent control and sanitation measures. The Shiant Islands in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland are often cited as the last remaining wild population of R. rattus left in Britain but evidence demonstrates that populations other than the Shiant Islands' survive on other islands and in localised areas of the British mainland. Recent National Biodiversity Network data show populations around the U.K., particularly in ports and port towns. This is supported by anecdotal records from London and Liverpool. As of winter 2015 the Shiant Isles Recovery Project (a joint initiative between RSPB and Scottish Natural Heritage) is underway to eradicate Rattus rattus populations on the islands.

A former militant, he was the first President of the Democratic Republic of East Timor (third president overall, after two presidents during their 1970s fight for independence), serving from May 2002 to May 2007. He then became the fourth Prime Minister of East Timor, serving from 8 August 2007\\"Gusmao sworn in as East Timor PM\\" , Al Jazeera, 8 August 2007. to 16 February 2015. He has been Minister of Planning and Strategic Investment since February 2015. Early life and career Gusm√£o was born in Manatuto, in what was then Portuguese Timor, to parents of mixed Portuguese-Timorese ancestry, both of whom were school teachers. He attended a Jesuit high school just outside Dili. After leaving high-school for financial reasons in 1961, at the age of 15, he held a variety of unskilled jobs, while continuing his education at night school. In 1965, at the age of 19, he met Emilia Batista, who was later to become his wife. His nickname, \\"Xanana\\", was taken from the name of the American rock and roll band Sha Na Na, who in turn were named after a lyric from a doo-wop song of 1957 by the Silhouettes. In 1966, Gusm√£o obtained a position with the public service, which allowed him to continue his education. This was interrupted in 1968 when Gusm√£o was recruited by the Portuguese Army for national service. He served for three years, rising to the rank of corporal. During this time, he married Emilia Batista, with whom he had a son Eugenio, and a daughter Zenilda. He has since divorced Emilia, and in 2000, he married Australian Kirsty Sword, with whom he had three sons: Alexandre, Kay Olok and Daniel. In 1971, Gusm√£o completed his national service, his son was born, and he became involved with a nationalist organisation headed by Jos√© Ramos-Horta. For the next three years he was actively involved in peaceful protests directed at the colonial system. It was in 1974 that a coup in Portugal resulted in the beginning of decolonisation for Portuguese Timor, and shortly afterwards the Governor M√°rio Lemos Pires announced plans to grant the colony independence. Plans were drawn up to hold general elections with a view to independence in 1978. During most of 1975 a bitter internal struggle occurred between two rival factions in Portuguese Timor. Gusm√£o became deeply involved with the Fretilin faction, and as a result he was arrested and imprisoned by the rival faction the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) in mid-1975. Taking advantage of the internal disorder, and with an eye to absorbing the colony, Indonesia immediately began a campaign of destabilisation, and frequent raids into Portuguese Timor were staged from Indonesian West Timor. By late 1975 the Fretilin faction had gained control of Portuguese Timor and Gusm√£o was released from prison. He was given the position of Press Secretary within the Fretilin organisation. On 28 November 1975, Fretilin declared the independence of Portuguese Timor as \\"The Democratic Republic of East Timor\\", and Gusm√£o was responsible for filming the ceremony. Nine days later, Indonesia invaded East Timor. At the time Gusm√£o was visiting friends outside of Dili and he witnessed the invasion from the hills. For the next few days he searched for his family. Indonesian occupation After the appointment of the \\"Provisional Government of East Timor\\" by Indonesia, Gusm√£o became heavily involved in resistance activities. Gusm√£o was largely responsible for the level of organisation that evolved in the resistance, which ultimately led to its success. The early days featured Gusm√£o walking from village to village to obtain support and recruits. But after Fretilin suffered some major setbacks in the early 1980s, including a failed 1984 coup attempt against Gusm√£o led by four senior Falintil officers, including Mauk Moruk. Gusm√£o left Fretilin and supported various centrist coalitions, eventually becoming a leading opponent of Fretilin. By the mid-1980s, he was a major leader. During the early 1990s, Gusm√£o became deeply involved in diplomacy and media management, and was instrumental in alerting the world to the massacre in Dili that occurred in Santa Cruz on 12 November 1991. Gusm√£o was interviewed by many major media channels and obtained worldwide attention. As a result of his high profile, Gusm√£o became a prime target of the Indonesian government. A campaign for his capture was finally successful in November 1992. In May 1993, Gusm√£o was tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Indonesian government. He was found guilty under Article 108 of the Indonesian Penal Code (rebellion), Law no. 12 of 1951 (illegal possession of firearms) and Article 106 (attempting to separate part of the territory of Indonesia).Amnesty International briefing on Xanana Gusmao He spoke in his own defence and he was appointed with defence lawyers before the commencement of his trial. The sentence was commuted to 20 years by Indonesian President Suharto in August 1993. Although not released until late 1999, Gusm√£o successfully led the resistance from within prison with the help of Kirsty Sword. By the time of his release, he was regularly visited by United Nations representatives, and dignitaries such as Nelson Mandela. Transition to independence Return of Gusm√£o to Aileu after Indonesian arrest On 30 August 1999, a referendum was held in East Timor and an overwhelming majority voted for independence. The Indonesian military commenced a campaign of terror as a result, with terrible consequences. Although the Indonesian government denied ordering this offensive, they were widely condemned for failing to prevent it. As a result of overwhelming diplomatic pressure from the United Nations, promoted by Portugal since the late 1970s and also by the United States and Australia in the 1990s, a UN- sanctioned, Australian-led international peace-keeping force (INTERFET) entered East Timor, and Gusm√£o was finally released. Upon his return to his native East Timor, he began a campaign of reconciliation and rebuilding. Gusm√£o was appointed to a senior role in the UN administration that governed East Timor until 20 May 2002. During this time he continually campaigned for unity and peace within East Timor, and was generally regarded as the de facto leader of the emerging nation. Elections were held in late 2001 and Gusm√£o, endorsed by nine parties but not by Fretilin, ran as an independent and was comfortably elected leader. As a result, he became the first President of East Timor when it became formally independent on 20 May 2002. Gusm√£o has published an autobiography with selected writings entitled To Resist Is to Win.

The remains of the villages within the tell come from over 4,000 years of pre-ceramic habitation spanning the Epipaleolithic and Neolithic periods. The site consisted of two villages; Abu Hureyra 1 and Abu Hureyra 2. Abu Hureyra 1's inhabitants were from the Epipaleolithic era and were sedentary hunter gatherers. Abu Hureyra 2 dates from early Neolithic times and was composed of farmers. Ancient Abu Hureyra was occupied between 13,000 and 9,000 years ago in radio carbon years. The site is significant because the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra started out as hunter-gatherers, but gradually moved to farming, making them the earliest known farmers in the world. Cultivation started at the beginning of the Younger Dryas period at Abu Hureyra. Evidence uncovered at Abu Hureyra suggests that rye was the first cereal crop to be systematically cultivated. In light of this, it is now believed that the first systematic cultivation of cereal crops was around 13000 years ago. Due to the late glacial interstate, the Abu Hureyra site experienced climatic change. Due to lake level changes and aridity the vegetation ended up expanding into lower areas of the fields. Abu Hureyra ended up accumulating vegetation that consisted of grasses, oaks, and what is known as Pistacia Atlantica trees. The climate changed from warm and dry months, to abruptly cold and dry months. History of research The site was excavated as a rescue operation before it was flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam which was being built at that time. The site was excavated by Andrew Moore in 1972 and 1973. It was limited to only two seasons of fieldwork. However, despite the limited time frame, a large amount of material was recovered and studied over the following decades. It was one of the first archaeological sites to use modern methods of excavation such as \\"flotation\\", which preserved even the tiniest and most fragile plant remains. A preliminary report was published in 1983 and a final report in 2000. Location and description Abu Hureyra is a tell, or ancient settlement mound, in modern-day Raqqa Governorate in northern Syria. It is on a plateau near the south bank of the Euphrates, east of Aleppo. The tell is a massive accumulation of collapsed houses, debris, and lost objects accumulated over the course of the habitation of the ancient village. The mound is nearly across, deep, and contained over of archaeological deposits. Today the tell is inaccessible, drowned beneath the waters of Lake Assad.  Occupation history   First occupation  Tell Abu Hureyra was at the northern end of the area of Natufian culture (12,000 to 9,500 BC), not far from Mureybet. The village of Abu Hureyra had two separate periods of occupation: An Epipalaeolithic settlement and a Neolithic settlement. The Epipaleolithic, or Natufian, settlement was established c. 13,500 years ago. During the first settlement, the village consisted of small round huts, cut into the soft sandstone of the terrace. The roofs were supported with wooden posts, and roofed with brushwood and reeds. Huts contained underground storage areas for food. The houses that they lived in were subterranean pit dwellings. The inhabitants are probably most accurately described as \\"hunter-collectors\\", as they didn't only forage for immediate consumption, but built up stores for longterm food security. They settled down around their larder to protect it from animals and other humans. From the distribution of wild food plant remains found at Abu Hureyra it seems that they lived there year-round. The population was small, housing a few hundred people at most‚Äîbut perhaps the largest collection of people permanently living in one place anywhere at that time. The inhabitants of Abu Hureyra obtained food by hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild plants. Gazelle was hunted primarily during the summer, when vast herds passed by the village during their annual migration. These would probably be hunted communally, as mass killings also required mass processing of meat, skin, and other parts of the animal. The huge amount of food obtained in a short period was a reason for settling down permanently: it was too heavy to carry and would need to be kept protected from weather and pests. Other prey included large wild animals such as onager, sheep, and cattle, and smaller animals such as hare, fox, and birds, which were hunted throughout the year. Different plant species were collected, from three different eco-zones within walking distance (river, forest, and steppe). Plant foods were also harvested from \\"wild gardens\\" with species gathered including wild cereal grasses such as einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, and two varieties of rye. Several large stone tools for grinding grain were found at the site. Abu Hureyra 1 had a variety of crops that made up the system. Their resources consisted of 41% of Rumex/ Polygonum, 43% of Rye/ einkorn, and the remaining 16% of Lentils.  Depopulation  After 1,300 years the hunter-gatherers of the first occupation mostly abandoned Abu Hureyra, probably because of the Younger Dryas, an intense and relatively abrupt return to glacial climate conditions which lasted over 1,000 years. The drought disrupted the migration of the gazelle and destroyed forageable plant food sources. It is likely that most of the inhabitants had to give up sedentism and return to nomadism, or they might have moved to Mureybet, just 50 km upstream on the other side of the Euphrates, which expanded dramatically at this time. It seems that a small population managed to hang on at Abu Hureyra ‚Äì maybe just a few single farms or a small hamlet. A study published in 2020 concluded that Abu Hureyra might have been hit by a comet 12,800 years ago, based on traces of \\"melt-glass\\", formed at extremely high temperatures, >, far higher than what humans could achieve at that time, in addition to traces of nanodiamonds and suessite, which are extremely rare under normal temperatures.  Second occupation  In comparison to Abu Hureyra 1, Abu Hureyra 2 had a different accumulation of resources that their site consisted of. Their resources consisted of 25% of Rumex/Polygonum, 3.7% of Rye/Einkorn, 29% of Barley, 23.5% of Emmer, 9.4% of Wheat-free threshing, and 9.4% of Lentils.Area of the Fertile Crescent, circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period. Only northwestern and northern Mesopotamia were occupied, and central and southern Mesopotamia, with insufficient natural rainfall, were not yet settled by humans. Gesher. It is from the early part of the Younger Dryas that the first indirect evidence of agriculture was detected in the excavations at Abu Hureyra, although the cereals themselves were still of the wild variety.Dow, Olewiler and Reed 2005 It was during the intentional sowing of cereals in more favourable refuges like Mureybet that these first farmers developed domesticated strains during the centuries of drought and cold of the Younger Dryas. When the climate abated about 9500 BCE they spread all over the Middle East with this new bio-technology, and Abu Hureyra grew to a large village eventually with several thousand people. The second occupation grew domesticated varieties of rye, wheat and barley, and kept sheep as livestock. The hunting of gazelle decreased sharply, probably due to overexploitation that eventually left them extinct in the Middle East. At Abu Hureyra they were replaced by meat from domesticated animals. The second occupation lasted for about 2,000 years.  Transition from foraging to farming  Some evidence has been found for cultivation of rye from 11050 BCE in the sudden rise of pollen from weed plants that typically infest newly disturbed soil. Peter Akkermans and Glenn Schwartz found this claim about epipaleolithic rye, \\"difficult to reconcile with the absence of cultivated cereals at Abu Hureyra and elsewhere for thousands of years afterwards\\". It could have been an early experiment that didn't survive and continue. It has been suggested that drier climate conditions resulting from the beginning of the Younger Dryas caused wild cereals to become scarce, leading people to begin cultivation as a means of securing a food supply. Results of recent analysis of the rye grains from this level suggest that they may actually have been domesticated during the Epipalaeolithic. It is speculated that the permanent population of the first occupation was fewer than 200 individuals. These individuals occupied several tens of square kilometers, a rich resource base of several different ecosystems. On this land they hunted, harvested food and wood, made charcoal, and may have cultivated cereals and grains for food and fuel. The first domesticated morphologic cereals came about at the Abu Hureyra site around 10,000 years ago.  Agriculture  Large and smaller stones used to grind cereal grains, Abu Hureyra, c. 9500‚Äì9000 BC. British Museum. The village of Abu Hureyra had impressive agricultural advances for the time period. The rapid growth of farming led to the development of two different domesticated forms of wheat, barley, rye, lentils, and more due in part to a sudden cool period in the area. The cool period affected the supply of wild animals such as gazelle, which at the time was their main source of protein. Since their food supply became scarce it was critical that they find a way to provide for the population, this led to extensive agricultural efforts as well as the domestication of sheep and goats to provide a steady protein source. Another helping factor was the ability to grow legumes, which fix nitrogen levels in the soil. This improved the fertility of the soil and allowed for the crop plants to flourish. The massive increase in agriculture did not come without cost. Those who lived in the village of Abu Hureyra experienced several injuries and skeletal abnormalities. These injuries mostly came from the way the crops were harvested. In order to harvest the crops the people of Abu Hureyra would kneel for several hours on end. The act of kneeling for long durations would put the individuals at risk for injuring the big toes, hips, and lower back. There was cartilage damage in the toe that was so severe the metatarsal bones would rub together. In addition to this injury another common injury was for the last dorsal vertebra to be damaged, crushed, or out of alignment due to the pressure used during the grinding of grains. These skeletal abnormalities also can be found on the teeth of the Abu Hureyra people. Since the grain was stone ground many flakes of stone would still be left in the grain which over time would wear down the teeth. In rare cases women would have large grooves in their front teeth which suggests they used their mouth as a third hand while weaving baskets. This dates basket weaving as far back as 6500 BC and the fact so few women had these grooves shows that basket weaving was a rare skill to have. These baskets were extremely important to the success of the agriculture because the baskets were used to collect or spread seeds, and were also used to collect or distribute water.

Typically, only one ear is affected initially; however, over time both ears may become involved. Episodes generally last from 20 minutes to a few hours. The time between episodes varies. The hearing loss and ringing in the ears can become constant over time. The cause of M√©ni√®re's disease is unclear but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. A number of theories exist for why it occurs including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, and autoimmune reactions. About 10% of cases run in families. Symptoms are believed to occur as the result of increased fluid build up in the labyrinth of the inner ear. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and, frequently, a hearing test. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include vestibular migraine and transient ischemic attack. A cure does not exist. Attacks are often treated with medications to help with the nausea and anxiety. Measures to prevent attacks are overall poorly supported by the evidence. A low-salt diet, diuretics, and corticosteroids may be tried. Physical therapy may help with balance and counselling may help with anxiety. Injections into the ear or surgery may also be tried if other measures are not effective but are associated with risks. The use of tympanostomy tubes, while popular, is not supported. M√©ni√®re's disease was first identified in the early 1800s by Prosper M√©ni√®re. It affects between 0.3 and 1.9 per 1,000 people. It most often starts in people 40 to 60 years old. Females are more commonly affected than males. After 5 to 15 years of symptoms, the episodes of the world spinning generally stop and the person is left with mild loss of balance, moderately poor hearing in the affected ear, and ringing in their ear.  Signs and symptoms  M√©ni√®re's is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus; episodes may be accompanied by a headache and a feeling of fullness in the ears. People may also experience additional symptoms related to irregular reactions of the autonomic nervous system. These symptoms are not symptoms of Meniere's disease per se, but rather are side effects resulting from failure of the organ of hearing and balance, and include nausea, vomiting, and sweating‚Äîwhich are typically symptoms of vertigo, and not of M√©ni√®re's. This includes a sensation of being pushed sharply to the floor from behind. Sudden falls without loss of consciousness (drop attacks) may be experienced by some people.  Causes  The cause of M√©ni√®re's disease is unclear but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. A number of theories exist including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, autoimmune reactions. Mechanism Inner ear The initial triggers of M√©ni√®re's disease are not fully understood, with a variety of potential inflammatory causes that lead to endolymphatic hydrops (EH), a distension of the endolymphatic spaces in the inner ear. EH, in turn, is strongly associated with developing MD, but not everyone with EH develops MD: \\"The relationship between endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere's disease is not a simple, ideal correlation.\\" Additionally, in fully developed MD the balance system (vestibular system) and the hearing system (cochlea) of the inner ear are affected, but there are cases where EH affects only one of the two systems enough to cause symptoms. The corresponding subtypes of MD are called vestibular MD, showing symptoms of vertigo, and cochlear MD, showing symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus.National Institutes of Health (NIH): M√©ni√®re's Disease, NIH Publication No. 10‚Äì3404, July 2010, last updated June 1, 2016. The mechanism of MD is not fully explained by EH, but fully developed EH may mechanically and chemically interfere with the sensory cells for balance and hearing, which can lead to temporary dysfunction and even to death of the sensory cells, which in turn can cause the typical symptoms of MD: vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.  Diagnosis  Audiograms illustrating normal hearing (left) and unilateral low-pitch hearing loss associated with M√©ni√®re's disease (right) Loudness discomfort levels (LDLs): data of people with hyperacusis without hearing loss. Upper line: average hearing thresholds. Lower long line: LDLs of this group. Lower short line: LDLs of a reference group with normal hearing. The diagnostic criteria as of 2015 define definite MD and probable MD as follows: > Definite # Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 > minutes to 12 hours # Audiometrically documented low- to medium-frequency > sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least 1 occasion > before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo # Fluctuating aural > symptoms (hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear # Not better > accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis Probable # Two or more > episodes of vertigo or dizziness, each lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours # > Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the reported > ear # Not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis A common and important symptom of MD is hypersensitivity to sounds. This hypersensitivity is easily diagnosed by measuring the loudness discomfort levels (LDLs). Symptoms of MD overlap with migraine-associated vertigo (MAV) in many ways, but when hearing loss develops in MAV it is usually in both ears, and this is rare in MD, and hearing loss generally does not progress in MAV as it does in MD. People who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke can present with symptoms similar to MD, and in people at risk magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be conducted to exclude TIA or stroke. Other vestibular conditions that should be excluded include vestibular paroxysmia, recurrent unilateral vestibulopathy, vestibular schwannoma, or a tumor of the endolymphatic sac.  Management  There is no cure for M√©ni√®re's disease but medications, diet, physical therapy and counseling, and some surgical approaches can be used to manage it.  Medications  During MD episodes, medications to reduce nausea are used, as are drugs to reduce the anxiety caused by vertigo. For longer-term treatment to stop progression, the evidence base is weak for all treatments. Although a causal relation between allergy and M√©ni√®re's disease is uncertain, medication to control allergies may be helpful. To assist with vertigo and balance problems, Glycopyrrolate has been found to be a useful vestibular suppressant in patients with Meniere's disease. Diuretics, such as the thiazide-like diuretic chlortalidone, are widely used to manage M√©ni√®re's on the theory that it reduces fluid buildup (pressure) in the ear. Based on evidence from multiple but small clinical trials, diuretics appear to be useful for reducing the frequency of episodes of dizziness but do not seem to prevent hearing loss. In cases where there is hearing loss and continuing severe episodes of vertigo, a chemical labyrinthectomy, in which a medication such as gentamicin is injected into the middle ear and kills parts of the vestibular apparatus. This treatment has the risk of worsening hearing loss. Diet People with MD are often advised to reduce their salt intake. Reducing salt intake, however, has not been well studied. Based on the assumption that MD is similar in nature to a migraine, some advise eliminating \\"migraine triggers\\" like caffeine. However, the evidence for this is weak. There is no high quality evidence that changing diet by restricting salt, caffeine or alcohol improves symptoms. Physical therapy While use of physical therapy early after the onset of MD is probably not useful due to the fluctuating disease course, physical therapy to help retraining of the balance system appears to be useful to reduce both subjective and objective deficits in balance over the longer term.  Counselling  The psychological distress caused by the vertigo and hearing loss may worsen the condition in some people. Counseling may be useful to manage the distress, as may education and relaxation techniques.  Surgery  If symptoms do not improve with typical treatment, surgery may be considered. Surgery to decompress the endolymphatic sac is one option. A systematic review in 2015 found that three methods of decompression have been used: simple decompression, insertion of a shunt; and removal of the sac. It found some evidence that all three methods were useful for reducing dizziness, but that the level of evidence was low, as trials were not blinded nor were there placebo controls. Another 2015 review found that shunts used in these surgeries often turn out to be displaced or misplaced in autopsies, and recommended their use only in cases where the condition is uncontrolled and affecting both ears. A systematic review from 2014 found that in at least 75% of people EL sac decompression was effective at controlling vertigo in the short term (>1 year of follow-up) and long term (>24 months). It has been estimated that about 30% of people with Meniere's disease have eustachian tube dysfunction. While a 2005 review found tentative evidence of benefit from tympanostomy tubes for improvement in the unsteadiness associated with the disease, a 2014 review concluded that they are not supported. Destructive surgeries are irreversible and involve removing entire functionality of most, if not all, of the affected ear; as of 2013, there was almost no evidence with which to judge whether these surgeries are effective. The inner ear itself can be surgically removed via labyrinthectomy, although hearing is always completely lost in the affected ear with this operation. The surgeon can also cut the nerve to the balance portion of the inner ear in a vestibular neurectomy. The hearing is often mostly preserved; however, the surgery involves cutting open into the lining of the brain, and a hospital stay of a few days for monitoring would be required.  Poorly supported  * As of 2014 betahistine is often used as it is inexpensive and safe; however evidence does not justify its use in M√©ni√®re's disease. * Transtympanic micropressure pulses were investigated in two systematic reviews. Neither found evidence to justify this technique. * Intratympanic steroids were investigated in three systematic reviews. It was concluded that the data were insufficient to decide if this therapy has positive effects. * Evidence does not support the use of alternative medicine such as acupuncture or herbal supplements.  Prognosis  M√©ni√®re's disease usually starts confined to one ear; it appears that it extends to both ears in about 30% of cases. People may start out with only one symptom, but in MD all three appear with time. Hearing loss usually fluctuates in the beginning stages and becomes more permanent in later stages. MD has a course of 5‚Äì15 years, and people generally end up with mild disequilibrium, tinnitus, and moderate hearing loss in one ear. Epidemiology From 3% to 11% of diagnosed dizziness in neuro-otological clinics are due to Meniere's. The annual incidence rate is estimated to be about 15/100,000 and the prevalence rate is about 218/100,000, and around 15% of people with Meniere's disease are older than 65. In around 9% of cases a relative also had MD, signalling that there may be a genetic predisposition in some cases. The odds of MD are greater for people of white ethnicity, with severe obesity, and women. Several conditions are often comorbid with MD, including arthritis, psoriasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraine.  History  The condition is named after the French physician Prosper M√©ni√®re, who in an 1861 article described the main symptoms and was the first to suggest a single disorder for all of the symptoms, in the combined organ of balance and hearing in the inner ear.M√©niere (1861) \\"Sur une forme de surdit√© grave d√©pendant d‚Äôune l√©sion de l‚Äôoreille interne\\" (On a form of severe deafness dependent on a lesion of the inner ear), Bulletin de l'Acad√©mie imp√©riale de m√©decine, 26 : 241. The American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium (AAO HNS CHE) set criteria for diagnosing M√©ni√®re's, as well as defining two sub- categories of M√©ni√®re's: cochlear (without vertigo) and vestibular (without deafness). In 1972, the Academy defined criteria for diagnosing M√©ni√®re's disease as: # Fluctuating, progressive, sensorineural deafness. # Episodic, characteristic definitive spells of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with no unconsciousness, vestibular nystagmus always present. # Tinnitus (ringing in the ears, from mild to severe) Often the tinnitus is accompanied by ear pain and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Usually, the tinnitus is more severe before a spell of vertigo and lessens after the vertigo attack. # Attacks are characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation. In 1985, this list changed to alter wording, such as changing \\"deafness\\" to \\"hearing loss associated with tinnitus, characteristically of low frequencies\\" and requiring more than one attack of vertigo to diagnose. Finally in 1995, the list was again altered to allow for degrees of the disease: # Certain ‚Äì Definite disease with histopathological confirmation # Definite ‚Äì Requires two or more definitive episodes of vertigo with hearing loss plus tinnitus and/or aural fullness # Probable ‚Äì Only one definitive episode of vertigo and the other symptoms and signs # Possible ‚Äì Definitive vertigo with no associated hearing loss In 2015, the International Classification for Vestibular Disorders Committee of the Barany Society published consensus diagnostic criteria in collaboration with the American Academy of Otolaryngology ‚Äì Head and Neck Surgery, the European Academy of Otology & Neuro-Otology, the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, and the Korean Balance Society.

Biography Meni√®re was born in Angers, France. During his education he excelled at humanities and classics. He completed his medical studies at H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris in 1826, and earned his M.D. in 1828. He then assisted Guillaume Dupuytren. Meni√®re was originally set to be an assistant professor in faculty, but political tensions disturbed his professorship and he was sent to control the spread of cholera. He received a legion of honor for his work, but never gained professorship. After securing the position of physician-in- chief at the Institute for deaf-mutes, he focused on the diseases of the ear. Meni√®re's studies at the deaf-mute institute helped formulate his paper, On a particular kind of hearing loss resulting from lesions of the inner ear which ultimately led to the recognition of M√©ni√®re's disease. There is debate as to how Meni√®re's name is spelled. Prosper himself was known to write his name as \\"Meni√®re\\" while his son used the spelling \\"M√©ni√®re.\\" Many people omit the accent marks.

It has importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus, on the tongue's surface. There are two groups of muscles of the tongue. The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone. The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone. Etymology The word tongue derives from the Old English tunge, which comes from Proto- Germanic *tung≈çn. It has cognates in other Germanic languages‚Äîfor example tonge in West Frisian, tong in Dutch and Afrikaans, Zunge in German, tunge in Danish and Norwegian, and tunga in Icelandic, Faroese and Swedish. The ue ending of the word seems to be a fourteenth-century attempt to show \\"proper pronunciation\\", but it is \\"neither etymological nor phonetic\\". Some used the spelling tunge and tonge as late as the sixteenth century. In humans Structure The underside of a human tongue, showing its rich blood supply. The tongue is a muscular hydrostat that forms part of the floor of the oral cavity. The left and right sides of the tongue are separated by a vertical section of fibrous tissue known as the lingual septum. This division is along the length of the tongue save for the very back of the pharyngeal part and is visible as a groove called the median sulcus. The human tongue is divided into anterior and posterior parts by the terminal sulcus which is a V-shaped groove. The apex of the terminal sulcus is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum, which is a remnant of the median thyroid diverticulum in early embryonic development. The anterior oral part is the visible part situated at the front and makes up roughly two-thirds the length of the tongue. The posterior pharyngeal part is the part closest to the throat, roughly one-third of its length. These parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply. The anterior tongue is, at its apex, thin and narrow. It is directed forward against the lingual surfaces of the lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane. It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx. The average length of the human tongue from the oropharynx to the tip is 10 cm. The average weight of the human tongue from adult males is 70g and for adult females 60g. In phonetics and phonology, a distinction is made between the tip of the tongue and the blade (the portion just behind the tip). Sounds made with the tongue tip are said to be apical, while those made with the tongue blade are said to be laminal. =Upper surface of the tongue= Foramen cecum and terminal sulcus labelled above Features of the tongue surface The upper surface of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into symmetrical halves by the median sulcus. The foramen cecum marks the end of this division (at about 2.5 cm from the root of the tongue) and the beginning of the terminal sulcus. The foramen cecum is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic development. The terminal sulcus is a shallow groove that runs forward as a shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to the margins (borders) of the tongue. The terminal sulcus divides the tongue into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. The pharyngeal part is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the oral part is supplied by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) for taste perception. Both parts of the tongue develop from different pharyngeal arches. =Undersurface of the tongue= On the undersurface of the tongue is a fold of mucous membrane called the frenulum that tethers the tongue at the midline to the floor of the mouth. On either side of the frenulum are small prominences called sublingual caruncles that the major salivary submandibular glands drain into. =Muscles= The eight muscles of the human tongue are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. The four intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue, and are not attached to any bone. The four extrinsic muscles act to change the position of the tongue, and are anchored to bone. Extrinsic Lateral view of the tongue, with extrinsic muscles highlighted The four extrinsic muscles originate from bone and extend to the tongue. They are the genioglossus, the hyoglossus (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus. Their main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion, retraction, and side-to-side movement. The genioglossus arises from the mandible and protrudes the tongue. It is also known as the tongue's \\"safety muscle\\" since it is the only muscle that propels the tongue forward. The hyoglossus, arises from the hyoid bone and retracts and depresses the tongue. The chondroglossus is often included with this muscle. The styloglossus arises from the styloid process of the temporal bone and draws the sides of the tongue up to create a trough for swallowing. The palatoglossus arises from the palatine aponeurosis, and depresses the soft palate, moves the palatoglossal fold towards the midline, and elevates the back of the tongue during swallowing. Intrinsic Coronal section of tongue, showing intrinsic muscles Four paired intrinsic muscles of the tongue originate and insert within the tongue, running along its length. They are the superior longitudinal muscle, the inferior longitudinal muscle, the vertical muscle, and the transverse muscle. These muscles alter the shape of the tongue by lengthening and shortening it, curling and uncurling its apex and edges as in tongue rolling, and flattening and rounding its surface. This provides shape and helps facilitate speech, swallowing, and eating. The superior longitudinal muscle runs along the upper surface of the tongue under the mucous membrane, and elevates, assists in retraction of, or deviates the tip of the tongue. It originates near the epiglottis, at the hyoid bone, from the median fibrous septum. The inferior longitudinal muscle lines the sides of the tongue, and is joined to the styloglossus muscle. The vertical muscle is located in the middle of the tongue, and joins the superior and inferior longitudinal muscles. The transverse muscle divides the tongue at the middle, and is attached to the mucous membranes that run along the sides. =Blood supply= Blood supply of the tongue The tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. The lingual veins drain into the internal jugular vein. The floor of the mouth also receives its blood supply from the lingual artery. There is also a secondary blood supply to the root of tongue from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. An area in the neck sometimes called the Pirogov triangle is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle, the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve. The lingual artery is a good place to stop severe hemorrhage from the tongue. =Nerve supply= Innervation of the tongue consists of motor fibers, special sensory fibers for taste, and general sensory fibers for sensation. *Motor supply for all intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue is supplied by efferent motor nerve fibers from the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), with the exception of the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X). Innervation of taste and sensation is different for the anterior and posterior part of the tongue because they are derived from different embryological structures (pharyngeal arch 1 and pharyngeal arches 3 and 4, respectively). *Anterior two thirds of tongue (anterior to the vallate papillae): Taste: chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) via special visceral afferent fibers Sensation: lingual branch of the mandibular (V3) division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) via general visceral afferent fibers *Posterior one third of tongue: Taste and sensation: glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via a mixture of special and general visceral afferent fibers *Base of tongue Taste and sensation: internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (itself a branch of the vagus nerve, CN X) = Lymphatic drainage = The tip of tongue drains to the submental nodes. The left and right halves of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue drains to submandibular lymph nodes, while the posterior one-third of the tongue drains to the jugulo-omohyoid nodes. =Microanatomy= H&E; The upper surface of the tongue is covered in masticatory mucosa a type of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Embedded in this are numerous papillae some of which house the taste buds and their taste receptors. The lingual papillae consist of filiform, fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae. and only the filiform papillae are not associated with any taste buds. The tongue can also divide itself in dorsal and ventral surface. The dorsal surface is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium which is characterized by numerous mucosal projections called papillae. The lingual papillae covers the dorsal side of the tongue towards the front of the terminal groove . The ventral surface is stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium which is smooth. Development Floor of pharynx at about 26 days showing lateral swellings at first pharyngeal arch (mandibular arch). The tongue begins to develop in the fourth week of embryonic development from a median swelling ‚Äì the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar) of the first pharyngeal arch. In the fifth week a pair of lateral lingual swellings, one on the right side and one on the left, form on the first pharyngeal arch. These lingual swellings quickly expand and cover the median tongue bud. They form the anterior part of the tongue that makes up two thirds of the length of the tongue, and continue to develop through prenatal development. The line of their fusion is marked by the median sulcus. In the fourth week a swelling appears from the second pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. During the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from the third and fourth arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence, and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). The hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of endoderm from the third pharyngeal arch. The boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal sulcus. The terminal sulcus is shaped like a V with the tip of the V situated posteriorly. At the tip of the terminal sulcus is the foramen cecum, which is the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct where the embryonic thyroid begins to descend. Function =Taste= Chemicals that stimulate taste receptor cells are known as tastants. Once a tastant is dissolved in saliva, it can make contact with the plasma membrane of the gustatory hairs, which are the sites of taste transduction. The tongue is equipped with many taste buds on its dorsal surface, and each taste bud is equipped with taste receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes. Distinct types of taste receptor cells respectively detect substances that are sweet, bitter, salty, sour, spicy, or taste of umami. Umami receptor cells are the least understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research. =Mastication= The tongue is an important accessory organ in the digestive system. The tongue is used for crushing food against the hard palate, during mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing. The epithelium on the tongue's upper, or dorsal surface is keratinised. Consequently, the tongue can grind against the hard palate without being itself damaged or irritated. =Speech= The intrinsic muscles of the tongue enable the shaping of the tongue which facilitates speech. =Intimacy= The tongue plays a role in physical intimacy and sexuality. The tongue is part of the erogenous zone of the mouth and can be used in intimate contact, as in the French kiss and in oral sex. It is used for pleasuring of the vagina. Clinical significance =Disease= A congenital disorder of the tongue is that of ankyloglossia also known as tongue-tie. The tongue is tied to the floor of the mouth by a very short and thickened frenulum and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing. The tongue is prone to several pathologies including glossitis and other inflammations such as geographic tongue, and median rhomboid glossitis; burning mouth syndrome, oral hairy leukoplakia, oral candidiasis (thrush), black hairy tongue and fissured tongue. There are several types of oral cancer that mainly affect the tongue. Mostly these are squamous cell carcinomas. Food debris, desquamated epithelial cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating. This coating has been identified as a major factor contributing to bad breath (halitosis), which can be managed by using a tongue cleaner. =Medication delivery= The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is an ideal location for the administration of certain medications into the body. The oral mucosa is very thin underneath the tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. This is the only convenient and efficacious route of administration (apart from Intravenous therapy) of nitroglycerin to a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris. Other animals Giraffe's tongue Extended proboscis of a long tongued Macroglossum moth The muscles of the tongue evolved in amphibians from occipital somites. Most amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. As a consequence most vertebrate animals‚Äîamphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals‚Äîhave tongues. In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body by licking. The tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites. Some dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma. A dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow. Some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for catching prey. For example, chameleons, frogs, pangolins and anteaters have prehensile tongues. Other animals may have organs that are analogous to tongues, such as a butterfly's proboscis or a radula on a mollusc, but these are not homologous with the tongues found in vertebrates and often have little resemblance in function. For example, butterflies do not lick with their proboscides; they suck through them, and the proboscis is not a single organ, but two jaws held together to form a tube. Many species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths that might informally be called tongues, but they lack a muscular structure like the true tongues found in most tetrapods. Society and culture Figures of speech The tongue can be used as a metonym for language. For example, the New Testament of the Bible, in the Book of Acts of the Apostles, Jesus' disciples on the Day of Pentecost received a type of spiritual gift: \\"there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues ....\\", which amazed the crowd of Jewish people in Jerusalem, who were from various parts of the Roman Empire but could now understand what was being preached. The phrase mother tongue is used as a child's first language. Many languagesAfrikaans tong; Danish tunge; Albanian gjuha; Armenian lezu (’¨’•’¶’∏÷Ç); Greek gl√≥ssa (Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ±); Irish teanga; Manx √ßhengey; Latin and Italian lingua; Catalan llengua; French langue; Portuguese l√≠ngua; Spanish lengua; Romanian limba; Bulgarian ezik (–µ–∑–∏–∫); Polish jƒôzyk; Russian yazyk (—è–∑—ã–∫); Czech and Slovak jazyk; Slovene, Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian jezik; Kurdish ziman (ÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ); Persian and Urdu zabƒÅn (ÿ≤ÿ®ÿßŸÜ); Arabic lisƒÅn (ŸÑÿ≥ÿßŸÜ); Aramaic li≈°≈°ƒÅnƒÅ (‹†‹´‹¢‹ê/◊ú◊©◊†◊ê); Hebrew lƒÅ≈°on (◊ú÷∏◊©◊Å◊ï÷π◊ü); Maltese ilsien; Estonian keel; Finnish kieli; Hungarian nyelv; Azerbaijani and Turkish dil; Kazakh and Khakas til (—Ç—ñ–ª) have the same word for \\"tongue\\" and \\"language\\". A common temporary failure in word retrieval from memory is referred to as the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is not to be taken entirely seriously ‚Äì something said or done with subtle ironic or sarcastic humour. A tongue twister is a phrase made specifically to be very difficult to pronounce. Aside from being a medical condition, \\"tongue-tied\\" means being unable to say what you want due to confusion or restriction. The phrase \\"cat got your tongue\\" refers to when a person is speechless. To \\"bite one's tongue\\" is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion to avoid causing offence. A \\"slip of the tongue\\" refers to an unintentional utterance, such as a Freudian slip. The \\"gift of tongues\\" refers to when one is uncommonly gifted to be able to speak in a foreign language, often as a type of spiritual gift. Speaking in tongues is a common phrase used to describe glossolalia, which is to make smooth, language-resembling sounds that is no true spoken language itself. A deceptive person is said to have a forked tongue, and a smooth-talking person said to have a . Gestures Sticking one's tongue out at someone is considered a childish gesture of rudeness or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending on the way in which it is done. However, in Tibet it is considered a greeting. In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy, was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with whom he had been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Body art Tongue piercing and splitting have become more common in western countries in recent decades. In one study, one-fifth of young adults were found to have at least one type of oral piercing, most commonly the tongue. As food The tongues of some animals are consumed and sometimes considered delicacies. Hot tongue sandwiches are frequently found on menus in kosher delicatessens in America. Taco de lengua (lengua being Spanish for tongue) is a taco filled with beef tongue, and is especially popular in Mexican cuisine. As part of Colombian gastronomy, Tongue in Sauce (Lengua en Salsa), is a dish prepared by frying the tongue, adding tomato sauce, onions and salt. Tongue can also be prepared as birria. Pig and beef tongue are consumed in Chinese cuisine. Duck tongues are sometimes employed in Szechuan dishes, while lamb's tongue is occasionally employed in Continental and contemporary American cooking. Fried cod \\"tongue\\" is a relatively common part of fish meals in Norway and Newfoundland. In Argentina and Uruguay cow tongue is cooked and served in vinegar (lengua a la vinagreta). In the Czech Republic and Poland, a pork tongue is considered a delicacy, and there are many ways of preparing it. In Eastern Slavic countries, pork and beef tongues are commonly consumed, boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled; beef tongues fetch a significantly higher price and are considered more of a delicacy. In Alaska, cow tongues are among the more common. Tongues of seals and whales have been eaten, sometimes in large quantities, by sealers and whalers, and in various times and places have been sold for food on shore.

Testing is often either logical testing or physical testing. The test procedures may involve other criteria from mathematical testing or chemical testing. Beyond simple conformance, other requirements for efficiency, interoperability or compliance may apply. Conformance testing may be undertaken by the producer of the product or service being assessed, by a user, or by an accredited independent organization, which can sometimes be the author of the standard being used. When testing is accompanied by certification, the products or services may then be advertised as being certified in compliance with the referred technical standard. Manufacturers and suppliers of products and services rely on such certification including listing on the certification body's website, to assure quality to the end user and that competing suppliers are on the same level. Aside from the various types of testing, related conformance testing activities include: * Surveillance * Inspection * Auditing * Certification * Accreditation. Forms of conformance testing The UK government identifies three forms of testing or assessment:Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Conformity Assessment and Accreditation Policy in the UK, published February 2017, accessed 8 August 2020 *1st party assessment (self assessment) *2nd party assessment (assessment by a purchaser or user of a product or service) *3rd party assessment (undertaken by an independent organisation)  Typical areas of application  Conformance testing is applied in various industries where a product or service must meet specific quality and/or regulatory standards. This includes areas such as: * biocompatibility proofing * data and communications protocol engineering * document engineering * electronic and electrical engineering * medical procedure proofing * pharmaceutical packaging * software engineering * building construction (fire) In all such testing, the subject of test is not just the formal conformance in aspects of completeness of filed proofs, validity of referred certificates, and qualification of operating staff. Rather, it also heavily focuses on operational conditions, physical conditions, and applied test environments. By extension conformance testing leads to a vast set of documents and files that allow for reiterating all performed tests.  Software engineering  In software testing, conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. Compilers, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.  Electronic and electrical engineering  In electronic engineering and electrical engineering, some countries and business environments (such as telecommunication companies) require that an electronic product meet certain requirements before they can be sold. Standards for telecommunication products written by standards organizations such as ANSI, the FCC, and IEC have certain criteria that a product must meet before compliance is recognized. In countries such as Japan, China, Korea, and some parts of Europe, products cannot be sold unless they are known to meet those requirements specified in the standards. Usually, manufacturers set their own requirements to ensure product quality, sometimes with levels much higher than what the governing bodies require. Compliance is realized after a product passes a series of tests without occurring some specified mode of failure. Compliance testing for electronic devices include emissions tests, immunity tests, and safety tests. Emissions tests ensure that a product will not emit harmful electromagnetic interference in communication and power lines. Immunity tests ensure that a product is immune to common electrical signals and electromagnetic interference (EMI) that will be found in its operating environment, such as electromagnetic radiation from a local radio station or interference from nearby products. Safety tests ensure that a product will not create a safety risk from situations such as a failed or shorted power supply, blocked cooling vent, and powerline voltage spikes and dips. For example, Ericsson's telecommunications research and development subsidiary Telcordia Technologies publishes conformance standards for telecommunication equipment to pass the following tests: ; Radiated immunity : An antenna is used to subject the device to electromagnetic waves, covering a large frequency range (usually from 80 MHz to 6 GHz). ; Radiated emissions : One or more antennas are used to measure the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves that a device emits. The amplitude must be under a set limit, with the limit depending on the device's classification. ; Conducted immunity : Low frequency signals (usually 10 kHz to 80 MHz) are injected onto the data and power lines of a device. This test is used to simulate the coupling of low frequency signals onto the power and data lines, such as from a local AM radio station. ; Conducted emissions : Similar to radiated emissions, except the signals are measured at the power lines with a filter device. ; Electrostatic discharge (ESD) immunity : Electrostatic discharges with various properties (rise time, peak voltage, fall time, and half time) are applied to the areas on the device that are likely to be discharged too, such as the faces, near user accessible buttons, etc. Discharges are also applied to a vertical and horizontal ground plane to simulate an ESD event on a nearby surface. Voltages are usually from 2 kV to 15 kV, but commonly go as high as 25 kV or more. ; Electrical Fast Transient Burst immunity (EFTB) : Bursts of high voltage pulses are applied to the powerlines to simulate events such as repeating voltage spikes from a motor. ; Powerline dip immunity : The line voltage is slowly dropped down then brought back up. ; Powerline surge immunity : A surge is applied to the line voltage.  Standardization and agreements  Several international standards relating to conformance testing are published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and covered in the divisions of ICS 03.120.20 for management and ICS 23.040.01 for technical.

The discrete topology is the finest topology that can be given on a set, i.e., it defines all subsets as open sets. In particular, each singleton is an open set in the discrete topology.  Definitions  Given a set X: * the discrete topology on X is defined by letting every subset of X be open (and hence also closed), and X is a discrete topological space if it is equipped with its discrete topology; * the discrete uniformity on X is defined by letting every superset of the diagonal {(x,x) : x is in X} in X √ó X be an entourage, and X is a discrete uniform space if it is equipped with its discrete uniformity. * the discrete metric \\\\rho on X is defined by :\\\\rho(x,y) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} 1 &\\\\mbox{if}\\\\ x eq y , \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\mbox{if}\\\\ x = y \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. :for any x,y \\\\in X. In this case (X,\\\\rho) is called a discrete metric space or a space of isolated points. * a set S is discrete in a metric space (X,d), for S \\\\subseteq X, if for every x \\\\in S, there exists some \\\\delta >0 (depending on x) such that d(x,y) >\\\\delta for all y \\\\in S\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}; such a set consists of isolated points. A set S is uniformly discrete in the metric space (X,d), for S \\\\subseteq X, if there exists Œµ > 0 such that for any two distinct x, y \\\\in S, d(x, y) > Œµ. A metric space (E,d) is said to be uniformly discrete if there exists a \\"packing radius\\" r>0 such that, for any x,y \\\\in E, one has either x=y or d(x,y)>r. The topology underlying a metric space can be discrete, without the metric being uniformly discrete: for example the usual metric on the set {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...} of real numbers. Let X = {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...}, consider this set using the usual metric on the real numbers. Then, X is a discrete space, since for each point 1/2n, we can surround it with the interval (1/2n  …õ, 1/2n \\\\+ …õ), where …õ = 1/2(1/2n  1/2n+1) = 1/2n+2. The intersection (1/2n  …õ, 1/2n \\\\+ …õ) ‚à© {1/2n} is just the singleton {1/2n}. Since the intersection of two open sets is open, and singletons are open, it follows that X is a discrete space. However, X cannot be uniformly discrete. To see why, suppose there exists an r>0 such that d(x,y)>r whenever x‚â†y. It suffices to show that there are at least two points x and y in X that are closer to each other than r. Since the distance between adjacent points 1/2n and 1/2n+1 is 1/2n+1, we need to find an n that satisfies this inequality: 1/2^{n+1} < r 1 < r2^{n+1} 1/r < 2^{n+1} \\\\log_2(1/r) < n+1 -\\\\log_2(r) < n+1 -1 - \\\\log_2(r) < n Since there is always an n bigger than any given real number, it follows that there will always be at least two points in X that are closer to each other than any positive r, therefore X is not uniformly discrete. ...  Properties  The underlying uniformity on a discrete metric space is the discrete uniformity, and the underlying topology on a discrete uniform space is the discrete topology. Thus, the different notions of discrete space are compatible with one another. On the other hand, the underlying topology of a non-discrete uniform or metric space can be discrete; an example is the metric space X := {1/n : n = 1,2,3,...} (with metric inherited from the real line and given by d(x,y) = x ‚àí y). This is not the discrete metric; also, this space is not complete and hence not discrete as a uniform space. Nevertheless, it is discrete as a topological space. We say that X is topologically discrete but not uniformly discrete or metrically discrete. Additionally: * The topological dimension of a discrete space is equal to 0. * A topological space is discrete if and only if its singletons are open, which is the case if and only if it doesn't contain any accumulation points. * The singletons form a basis for the discrete topology. * A uniform space X is discrete if and only if the diagonal {(x,x) : x is in X} is an entourage. * Every discrete topological space satisfies each of the separation axioms; in particular, every discrete space is Hausdorff, that is, separated. * A discrete space is compact if and only if it is finite. * Every discrete uniform or metric space is complete. * Combining the above two facts, every discrete uniform or metric space is totally bounded if and only if it is finite. * Every discrete metric space is bounded. * Every discrete space is first-countable; it is moreover second- countable if and only if it is countable. * Every discrete space is totally disconnected. * Every non-empty discrete space is second category. * Any two discrete spaces with the same cardinality are homeomorphic. * Every discrete space is metrizable (by the discrete metric). * A finite space is metrizable only if it is discrete. * If X is a topological space and Y is a set carrying the discrete topology, then X is evenly covered by (the projection map is the desired covering) * The subspace topology on the integers as a subspace of the real line is the discrete topology. *A discrete space is separable if and only if it is countable. Any function from a discrete topological space to another topological space is continuous, and any function from a discrete uniform space to another uniform space is uniformly continuous. That is, the discrete space X is free on the set X in the category of topological spaces and continuous maps or in the category of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous maps. These facts are examples of a much broader phenomenon, in which discrete structures are usually free on sets. With metric spaces, things are more complicated, because there are several categories of metric spaces, depending on what is chosen for the morphisms. Certainly the discrete metric space is free when the morphisms are all uniformly continuous maps or all continuous maps, but this says nothing interesting about the metric structure, only the uniform or topological structure. Categories more relevant to the metric structure can be found by limiting the morphisms to Lipschitz continuous maps or to short maps; however, these categories don't have free objects (on more than one element). However, the discrete metric space is free in the category of bounded metric spaces and Lipschitz continuous maps, and it is free in the category of metric spaces bounded by 1 and short maps. That is, any function from a discrete metric space to another bounded metric space is Lipschitz continuous, and any function from a discrete metric space to another metric space bounded by 1 is short. Going the other direction, a function f from a topological space Y to a discrete space X is continuous if and only if it is locally constant in the sense that every point in Y has a neighborhood on which f is constant.  Uses  A discrete structure is often used as the \\"default structure\\" on a set that doesn't carry any other natural topology, uniformity, or metric; discrete structures can often be used as \\"extreme\\" examples to test particular suppositions. For example, any group can be considered as a topological group by giving it the discrete topology, implying that theorems about topological groups apply to all groups. Indeed, analysts may refer to the ordinary, non-topological groups studied by algebraists as \\"discrete groups\\" . In some cases, this can be usefully applied, for example in combination with Pontryagin duality. A 0-dimensional manifold (or differentiable or analytic manifold) is nothing but a discrete topological space. We can therefore view any discrete group as a 0-dimensional Lie group. A product of countably infinite copies of the discrete space of natural numbers is homeomorphic to the space of irrational numbers, with the homeomorphism given by the continued fraction expansion. A product of countably infinite copies of the discrete space {0,1} is homeomorphic to the Cantor set; and in fact uniformly homeomorphic to the Cantor set if we use the product uniformity on the product. Such a homeomorphism is given by using ternary notation of numbers. (See Cantor space.) In the foundations of mathematics, the study of compactness properties of products of {0,1} is central to the topological approach to the ultrafilter principle, which is a weak form of choice.  Indiscrete spaces  In some ways, the opposite of the discrete topology is the trivial topology (also called the indiscrete topology), which has the fewest possible open sets (just the empty set and the space itself). Where the discrete topology is initial or free, the indiscrete topology is final or cofree: every function from a topological space to an indiscrete space is continuous, etc.  See also  * Cylinder set * List of topologies * Taxicab geometry  References  * Topology General topology Topological spaces ","title":"Discrete space"},{"id":"56075","text":"The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather, carrier- capable tactical airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft. This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier, piston-engined E-1 Tracer, which was rapidly becoming obsolete. The aircraft's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B, and E-2C versions, where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics. The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D, which first flew in 2007. The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role, as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe, such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry. Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960, giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft. The E-2 also received the nickname \\"Super Fudd\\"Koppmann, George C., Carrier Airborne Early Warning. George C. Koppmann (LT, USNR ‚Äì inactive) home page. Retrieved: 13 December 2006. because it replaced the WF (later E-1) \\"Willy Fudd\\". In recent decades, the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the \\"Hummer\\" because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines, quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines. In addition to U.S. Navy service, smaller numbers of E-2s have been sold to the armed forces of Egypt, France, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and Taiwan. Development Background Continual improvements in airborne radars through 1956 led to the construction of AEW airplanes by several different countries and several different armed forces. The functions of command and control and sea and air surveillance were also added. The first carrier-based aircraft to perform these missions for the U.S. Navy and its allies was the Douglas AD Skyraider, which was replaced in US Navy service by the Grumman E-1 Tracer, which was a modified version of the S-2 Tracker twin-engine anti-submarine warfare aircraft, where the radar was carried in an aerofoil-shaped radome carried above the aircraft's fuselage.Godfrey 1977, pp. 7‚Äì8. E-2A and E-2B Hawkeye In 1956, the U.S. Navy developed a requirement for an airborne early warning aircraft where its data could be integrated into the Naval Tactical Data System aboard the Navy's ships, with a design from Grumman being selected to meet this requirement in March 1957.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 244. Its design, initially designated W2F-1, but later redesignated the E-2A Hawkeye, was the first carrier plane that had been designed from its wheels up as an AEW and command and control airplane. The problems facing the design engineers at Grumman were immense, and were compounded by having to constrain the design to enable the aircraft to operate from the older modified s. These ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô carriers were built during World War II and later modified to allow them to operate jet aircraft. Consequently, various height, weight and length restrictions had to be factored into the E-2A design, resulting in some handling characteristics which were less than ideal. The E-2A actually never operated from the modified Essex class carriers. A Grumman E-2A Hawkeye in flight in the early 1960s The first prototype, acting as an aerodynamic testbed only, flew on 21 October 1960. The first fully equipped aircraft followed it on 19 April 1961, and entered service with the US Navy as the E-2A in January 1964.Taylor 1976, p. 291. By 1965 the major development problems delaying the E-2A Hawkeye got so bad that the aircraft was actually cancelled after 59 aircraft had already been built. Particular difficulties were being experienced due to inadequate cooling in the closely packed avionics compartment. Early computer and complex avionics systems generated considerable heat; without proper ventilation this would lead to system failures. These failures continued long after the aircraft entered service and at one point reliability was so bad that the entire fleet of aircraft was grounded. After Navy officials had been forced to explain to Congress why four production contracts had been signed before avionics testing had been completed, action was taken; Grumman and the US Navy scrambled to improve the design. The unreliable rotary drum computer was replaced by a Litton L-304 digital computer * Alt URL * and various avionics systems were replaced ‚Äì the upgraded aircraft were designated E-2Bs. In total, 49 of the 59 E-2As were upgraded to E-2B standard. These aircraft replaced the E-1B Tracers in the various US Navy AEW squadrons. E-2C Hawkeye and upgrades An E-2C Hawkeye assigned to VAW-120 flies over Jacksonville, Florida Radar operations inside an E-2C of VAW-115 An E-2C Hawkeye takes off from the in 2019 Although the upgraded E-2B was a vast improvement on the unreliable E-2A, it was an interim measure. The US Navy knew the design had much greater capability and had yet to achieve the performance and reliability parameters set out in the original 1957 design. In April 1968, a reliability improvement program was instigated. In addition, now that the capabilities of the aircraft were starting to be realized, more were desired; 28 new E-2Cs were ordered to augment the 49 E-2Bs that would be upgraded. Improvements in the new and upgraded aircraft were concentrated in the radar and computer performance. Two E-2A test machines were modified as E-2C prototypes, the first flying on 20 January 1971. Trials proved satisfactory and the E-2C was ordered into production, the first production machine performed its initial flight on 23 September 1972. The original E-2C, known as Group 0, consisted of 55 aircraft; the first aircraft became operational in 1973 and serving on carriers in the 1980s and 1990s, until they were replaced in first-line service by Group II aircraft. US Navy Reserve used some aircraft for tracking drug smugglers. The type was commonly used in conjunction with Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighters; monitoring airspace and then vectoring Tomcats over the Link-4A datalink to destroy potential threats with long range AIM-54C Phoenix missiles. The next production run, between 1988 and 1991, saw 18 aircraft built to the Group I standard. Group I aircraft replaced the E-2's older APS-125 radar and T56-A-425 turboprops with their successors, the APS-139 radar system and T56-A-427 turboprops. The first Group I aircraft entered service in August 1981. Upgrading the Group 0 aircraft to Group I specifications was considered, but the cost was comparable to a new production aircraft, so upgrades were not conducted. Group I aircraft were only flown by the Atlantic fleet squadrons. This version was followed within a few years by the Group II, which had the improved APS-145 radar. A total of 50 Group II aircraft were delivered, 12 being upgraded Group I aircraft. This new version entered service in June 1992 and served with the Pacific and Atlantic Fleet squadrons. By 1997, the US Navy intended that all front line squadrons would be equipped, for a total of 75 Group II aircraft. Grumman merged with Northrop in 1994 and plans began on the Group II Plus, also known as the Group II / NAV upgrade. This kept the same computer and radar as the Group II while upgrading the pilot avionics, such as replacing the mechanical Inertial Navigation System (INS) with a more reliable and accurate laser Ring Gyroscope-driven INS, installing dual Multifunction Display Units (MFCDUs) (vice one in the Group II), and the integration of GPS into the weapon system. A variant of the Group II with upgrades to the mission computer and CIC workstations is referred to as the MCU/ACIS, these were produced in small numbers due to production of the Hawkeye 2000 soon after its introduction. All Group II aircraft had their 1960s vintage computer processors replaced by a mission computer with the same functionality via modern computer technology, referred to as the GrIIM RePr (Group II Mission Computer Replacement Program, pronounced \\"grim reaper\\"). Another upgrade to the Group II was the Hawkeye 2000, which featured the same APS-145 radar but incorporated an upgraded mission computer and CIC (Combat Information Center) workstations (Advanced Control Indicator Set or ACIS), and carries the U.S. Navy's new CEC (cooperative engagement capability) data-link system. It is also fitted with a larger capacity vapor cycle avionics cooling system. Starting in 2007 a hardware and software upgrade package began to be added to existing Hawkeye 2000 aircraft. This upgrade allows faster processing, double current trackfile capacity and access to satellite information networks. Hawkeye 2000 cockpits being upgraded include solid-state glass displays, and a GPS-approach capability. The remaining Hawkeye Group II NAV Upgrade aircraft received GPS approach capability, but did not get the solid-state glass displays. In 2004, the E-2C's propeller system was changed; a new eight-bladed propeller system named NP2000 was developed by the Hamilton-Sundstrand company to replace the old four-bladed design. Improvements included reduced vibrations and better maintainability as a result of the ability to remove prop blades individually instead of having to remove the entire prop and hub assembly. The propeller blades are of carbon fiber construction with steel leading edge inserts and de-icing boots at the root of the blade. E-2D Advanced Hawkeye E-2D of VAW-125 over NS Norfolk Once considered for replacement by the \\"Common Support Aircraft\\", this concept was abandoned. The latest E-2 version is the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which features an entirely new avionics suite including the new AN/APY-9 radar, radio suite, mission computer, integrated satellite communications, flight management system, improved T56-A-427A engines, a glass cockpit and later changes should enable aerial refueling by 2020. The APY-9 radar features an active electronically scanned array, which adds electronic scanning to the mechanical rotation of the radar in its radome. The E-2D includes provisions for the copilot to act as a \\"Tactical 4th Operator\\" (T4O), who can reconfigure his main cockpit display to show radar, IFF, and Link 16 (JTIDS)/CEC, and access all acquired data. The E-2D's first flight occurred on 3 August 2007.\\"Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Completes First Flight\\" . Northrop Grumman, 3 August 2007. On 8 May 2009, an E-2D used its Cooperative Engagement Capability system to engage an overland cruise missile with a Standard Missile SM-6 fired from another platform in an integrated fire- control system test. These two systems will form the basis of the Naval Integrated Fire Control ‚Äì Counter Air (NIFC-CA) when fielded in 2015; the USN is investigating adding other systems to the NIFC-CA network in the future. The APY-9 radar has been suspected of being capable of detecting fighter-sized stealth aircraft, which are typically optimized against high frequencies like Ka, Ku, X, C, and parts of the S-bands. Small aircraft lack the size or weight allowances for all-spectrum low-observable features, leaving a vulnerability to detection by the UHF-band APY-9 radar, potentially detecting fifth- generation fighters like the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 and the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang J-31. Historically, UHF radars had resolution and detection issues that made them ineffective for accurate targeting and fire control; Northrop Grumman and Lockheed claim that the APY-9 has solved these shortcomings in the APY-9 using advanced electronic scanning and high digital computing power via space/time adaptive processing. According to the Navy's NIFC-CA concept, the E-2D could guide fleet weapons, such as AIM-120 AMRAAM and SM-6 missiles, onto targets beyond a launch platform's detection range or capabilities.The U.S. Navy's Secret Counter-Stealth Weapon Could Be Hiding in Plain Sight ‚Äì News.USNI.org, 9 June 2014 The first E-2D with aerial refueling capability was delivered in September 2019.

Defense News. 11 April 2018. Design E-1 Tracer, the E-2 uses the Grumman Sto-Wing folding wing system for carrier storage. The E-2 is a high-wing airplane, with one Allison T56 turboprop engine (5250 shp rating) on each wing Retrieved on 2 November 2013 and retractable tricycle landing gear. As with most carrier-borne airplanes, the E-2 is equipped with a tail hook for recovery (landing), and the nose gear can attach to a shuttle of the aircraft carrier's catapults for launch (takeoff). A distinguishing feature of the Hawkeye is its 24-foot (7.3 m) diameter rotating radar dome (rotodome) that is mounted above its fuselage and wings. This carries the E-2's primary antennas for its long- range radar and IFF systems. No other carrier-borne aircraft possesses one of these. Land-based aircraft with rotodomes include the Boeing E-3 Sentry, a larger AWACS airplane operated by the U.S. Air Force and NATO air forces in large numbers. The similarly-placed stationary radome of the E-2's piston- engined predecessor, the E-1 Tracer, also mandated the E-2's adoption of a modern version of Grumman's long-patented Sto-Wing folding wing system, preventing the folded wing panels from making contact with the E-2's rotodome. The aircraft is operated by a crew of five, with the pilot and co-pilot on the flight deck and the combat information center officer, air control officer and radar operator stations located in the rear fuselage directly beneath the rotodome. In U.S. service, the E-2 Hawkeye provides all-weather airborne early warning and command and control capabilities for all aircraft-carrier battle groups. In addition, its other purposes include sea and land surveillance, the control of the aircraft carrier's fighter planes for air defense, the control of strike aircraft on offensive missions, the control of search and rescue missions for naval aviators and sailors lost at sea, and for the relay of radio communications, air-to-air and ship-to-air. It can also serve in an air traffic control capacity in emergency situations when land-based ATC is unavailable. The E-2C and E-2D Hawkeyes use advanced electronic sensors combined with digital computer signal processing, especially its radars, for early warning of enemy aircraft attacks and anti-ship missile attacks, and the control of the carrier's combat air patrol (CAP) fighters, and secondarily for surveillance of the surrounding sea and land for enemy warships and guided- missile launchers, and any other electronic surveillance missions as directed. Operational history US Navy A US Navy E-2C of VAW-117 approaches the flight deck of ; the aircraft has eight-blade propellers. The E-2A entered U.S. Navy service in January 1964, and in April 1964 with VAW-11 at NAS North Island. The first deployment was aboard the aircraft carrier during 1965.Godfrey 1977, p.8. Since entering combat during the Vietnam War, the E-2 has served the US Navy around the world, acting as the electronic \\"eyes of the fleet\\". In August 1981, a Hawkeye from VAW-124 \\"Bear Aces\\" directed two F-14 Tomcats from VF-41 \\"Black Aces\\" in an intercept mission in the Gulf of Sidra that resulted in the downing of two Libyan Sukhoi Su-22s. Hawkeyes from VAW-123 aboard the aircraft carrier directed a group of F-14 Tomcat fighters flying the Combat Air Patrol during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the joint strike of two Carrier Battle Groups in the Mediterranean Sea against Libyan terrorist targets during 1986. More recently, E-2Cs provided the command and control for both aerial warfare and land-attack missions during the Persian Gulf War. Hawkeyes have supported the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and American federal and state police forces during anti-drug operations. In the mid-1980s, several U.S. Navy E-2Cs were made available to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs Service for counter-narcotics (CN) and maritime interdiction operations (MIO). This also led to the Coast Guard building a small cadre of Naval Flight Officers (NFOs), starting with the recruitment and interservice transfer of Navy flight officers with E-2 flight experience and the flight training of other junior Coast Guard officers as NFOs. A fatal aircraft mishap on 24 August 1990 involving a Coast Guard E-2C at the former Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico prompted the Coast Guard to discontinue flying E-2Cs and to return its E-2Cs to the Navy. The U.S Customs Service also returned its E-2Cs to the Navy and concentrated on the use of former U.S. Navy P-3 Orion aircraft in the CN role. Hawkeye interior (Group 0 configuration) E-2C Hawkeye squadrons played a critical role in air operations during Operation Desert Storm. In one instance, a Hawkeye crew provided critical air control direction to two F/A-18 Hornet aircrew, resulting in the shootdown of two Iraqi MiG-21s. During Operations Southern Watch and Desert Fox, Hawkeye crews continued to provide thousands of hours of air coverage, while providing air-to-air and air-to-ground command and control in a number of combat missions. The E-2 Hawkeye is a crucial component of all U.S. Navy carrier air wings; each carrier is equipped with four Hawkeyes (five in some situations), allowing for continuous 24-hour-a-day operation of at least one E-2 and for one or two to undergo maintenance in the aircraft carrier's hangar deck at all times. Until 2005, the US Navy Hawkeyes were organized into East and West coast wings, supporting the respective fleets. However, the East coast wing was disestablished, all aircraft were organized into a single wing based at Point Mugu, California. Six E-2C aircraft were deployed by the US Naval Reserve for drug interdiction and homeland security operations until 9 March 2013, when the sole Reserve squadron, VAW-77 'Nightwolves', was decommissioned and its six aircraft sent to other squadrons. During Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom all ten Regular Navy Hawkeye squadrons flew overland sorties. They provided battle management for attack of enemy ground targets, close-air-support coordination, combat search and rescue control, airspace management, as well as datalink and communication relay for both land and naval forces. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, three Hawkeye squadrons (two Regular Navy and one Navy Reserve) were deployed in support of civilian relief efforts including Air Traffic Control responsibilities spanning three states, and the control of U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and Army National Guard and Air National Guard helicopter rescue units.

In September 2019 Florence Parly, French Minister of the Armed Forces, announced that three new E-2D Advanced Hawkeye will be purchased in 2020 to replace the E-2C Hawkeyes in service. =Japan= On 6 September 1976, Soviet Air Forces pilot Viktor Belenko successfully defected, landing his MiG-25 'Foxbat' at Hakodate Airport, Japan. During this incident, the Japan Self-Defense Forces' (JASDF) radar lost track of the aircraft when Belenko flew his MiG-25 at a low altitude, prompting the JASDF to consider procurement of airborne early warning aircraft. Initially, the E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control system aircraft was considered to be the prime candidate for the airborne early warning mission by the JASDF. However, the Japanese Defense Agency realized that the E-3 would not be readily available due to USAF needs and opted to procure E-2 Hawkeye aircraft. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force bought thirteen E-2C aircraft to improve its early warning capabilities. The E-2C was put into service with the Airborne Early Warning Group (AEWG) at Misawa Air Base in January 1987. On 21 November 2014, the Japanese Ministry of Defense officially decided to procure the E-2D version of the Hawkeye, instead of the Boeing 737 AEW&C; design.Japan Officially Selects Osprey, Global Hawk, E-2D ‚Äì Defensenews.com, 21 November 2014 In June 2015, the Japanese government requested to buy four E-2Ds through a Foreign Military Sale.Japan raises E-2D acquisition to four aircraft ‚Äì Flightglobal.com, 2 June 2015 In September 2018 the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale of up to 9 E-2Ds to Japan. =Mexico= In 2004, three former Israel Air Force E-2C aircraft were sold to the Mexican Navy to perform maritime and shore surveillance missions. These aircraft were upgraded locally by IAI. The first Mexican E-2C was rolled out in January 2004. =Singapore= RSAF from 111 Sqn on static display at Paya Lebar Air Base, 2006 The Republic of Singapore Air Force acquired four Grumman E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft in 1987, which are assigned to the 111 Squadron \\"Jaeger\\" based at Tengah Air Base. In April 2007, it was announced that the four E-2C Hawkeyes were to be replaced with four Gulfstream G550s which would become the primary early warning aircraft of the Singapore Air Force. On 13 April 2012, the newer G550 AEWs officially took over duty from the former. Singapore has close ties with the Israel military which has also acquired the G550 AEW. =Israel= Israel was the first export customer; its four Hawkeyes were delivered during 1981, complete with the folding wings characteristic of carrier-borne aircraft. The four examples were soon put into active service before and during the 1982 Lebanon War during which they won a resounding victory over Syrian air defenses and fighter control. They were central to the Israeli victory in the air battles over the Bekaa Valley during which more than 90 Syrian fighters were downed. The Hawkeyes were also the linchpins of the operation in which the IAF destroyed the surface-to-air missile (SAM) array in the Bekaa, coordinating the various stages of the operation, vectoring planes into bombing runs and directing intercepts. Under constant escort by F-15 Eagles, there were always two Hawkeyes on station off the Lebanese coast, controlling the various assets in the air and detecting any Syrian aircraft upon their takeoff, eliminating any chance of surprise. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) operated four E-2s for its homeland AEW protection through 1994. The IAF was the first user of the E-2 to install air-to-air refueling equipment. Three of the four Israeli-owned Hawkeyes were sold to Mexico in 2002 after they had been upgraded with new systems; the remaining example was sent to be displayed in the Israeli Air Force Museum. In 2010, Singapore began retiring its E-2Cs as well. Both Israel and Singapore now employ the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Eitam, a Gulfstream G550-based platform with Elta's EL/W-2085 sensor package (a newer derivative of the airborne Phalcon system) for their national AEW programs. =Taiwan= ROCAF E-2K, the updated E-2T, at Songshan Air Force Base, 2011 Taiwan acquired four E-2T aircraft from the US on 22 November 1995. On 15 April 2006 Taiwan commissioned two new E-2K Hawkeyes at an official ceremony at the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) base in Pingtung Airport in southern Taiwan. The four E-2Ts were approved for upgrade to Hawkeye 2000 configuration in a 2008 arms deal. The four E-2T aircraft were upgraded to what became known as E-2K standard in two batches, the first batch of two aircraft were sent to the United States in June 2010, arriving home in late 2011; on their return the second batch of two aircraft were sent for upgrade, returning to Taiwan in March 2013. =Offers= In August 2009, the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman briefed the Indian Navy on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye on its potential use to satisfy its current shore-based and future carrier-based Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C;) requirements.

The Krull dimension need not be finite even for a Noetherian ring. More generally the Krull dimension can be defined for modules over possibly non-commutative rings as the deviation of the poset of submodules. The Krull dimension was introduced to provide an algebraic definition of the dimension of an algebraic variety: the dimension of the affine variety defined by an ideal I in a polynomial ring R is the Krull dimension of R/I. A field k has Krull dimension 0; more generally, k[x1, ..., xn] has Krull dimension n. A principal ideal domain that is not a field has Krull dimension 1. A local ring has Krull dimension 0 if and only if every element of its maximal ideal is nilpotent. There are several other ways that have been used to define the dimension of a ring. Most of them coincide with the Krull dimension for Noetherian rings, but can differ for non-Noetherian rings. Explanation We say that a chain of prime ideals of the form \\\\mathfrak{p}_0\\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_1\\\\subsetneq \\\\ldots \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_n has length n. That is, the length is the number of strict inclusions, not the number of primes; these differ by 1. We define the Krull dimension of R to be the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals in R. Given a prime \\\\mathfrak{p} in R, we define the ' of \\\\mathfrak{p}, written \\\\operatorname{ht}(\\\\mathfrak{p}), to be the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals contained in \\\\mathfrak{p}, meaning that \\\\mathfrak{p}_0\\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_1\\\\subsetneq \\\\ldots \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_n = \\\\mathfrak{p}.Matsumura, Hideyuki: \\"Commutative Ring Theory\\", page 30‚Äì31, 1989 In other words, the height of \\\\mathfrak{p} is the Krull dimension of the localization of R at \\\\mathfrak{p}. A prime ideal has height zero if and only if it is a minimal prime ideal. The Krull dimension of a ring is the supremum of the heights of all maximal ideals, or those of all prime ideals. The height is also sometimes called the codimension, rank, or altitude of a prime ideal. In a Noetherian ring, every prime ideal has finite height. Nonetheless, Nagata gave an example of a Noetherian ring of infinite Krull dimension.Eisenbud, D. Commutative Algebra (1995). Springer, Berlin. Exercise 9.6. A ring is called catenary if any inclusion \\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{q} of prime ideals can be extended to a maximal chain of prime ideals between \\\\mathfrak{p} and \\\\mathfrak{q}, and any two maximal chains between \\\\mathfrak{p} and \\\\mathfrak{q} have the same length. A ring is called universally catenary if any finitely generated algebra over it is catenary. Nagata gave an example of a Noetherian ring which is not catenary.Matsumura, H. Commutative Algebra (1970). Benjamin, New York. Example 14.E. In a Noetherian ring, a prime ideal has height at most n if and only if it is a minimal prime ideal over an ideal generated by n elements (Krull's height theorem and its converse). It implies that the descending chain condition holds for prime ideals in such a way the lengths of the chains descending from a prime ideal are bounded by the number of generators of the prime. More generally, the height of an ideal I is the infimum of the heights of all prime ideals containing I. In the language of algebraic geometry, this is the codimension of the subvariety of Spec(R) corresponding to I.Matsumura, Hideyuki: \\"Commutative Ring Theory\\", page 30‚Äì31, 1989 Schemes It follows readily from the definition of the spectrum of a ring Spec(R), the space of prime ideals of R equipped with the Zariski topology, that the Krull dimension of R is equal to the dimension of its spectrum as a topological space, meaning the supremum of the lengths of all chains of irreducible closed subsets. This follows immediately from the Galois connection between ideals of R and closed subsets of Spec(R) and the observation that, by the definition of Spec(R), each prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} of R corresponds to a generic point of the closed subset associated to \\\\mathfrak{p} by the Galois connection. Examples * The dimension of a polynomial ring over a field k[x1, ..., xn] is the number of variables n. In the language of algebraic geometry, this says that the affine space of dimension n over a field has dimension n, as expected. In general, if R is a Noetherian ring of dimension n, then the dimension of R[x] is n + 1. If the Noetherian hypothesis is dropped, then R[x] can have dimension anywhere between n + 1 and 2n + 1. * For example, the ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} = (y^2 - x, y) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}[x,y] has height 2 since we can form the maximal ascending chain of prime ideals(0)=\\\\mathfrak{p}_0 \\\\subsetneq (y^2 - x)= \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\subsetneq (y^2 - x, y) = \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 = \\\\mathfrak{p}. * Given an irreducible polynomial f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z], the ideal I = (f^3) is not prime (since f\\\\cdot f^2 \\\\in I, but neither of the factors are), but we can easily compute the height since the smallest prime ideal containing I is just (f). * The ring of integers Z has dimension 1. More generally, any principal ideal domain that is not a field has dimension 1. * An integral domain is a field if and only if its Krull dimension is zero. Dedekind domains that are not fields (for example, discrete valuation rings) have dimension one. * The Krull dimension of the zero ring is typically defined to be either -\\\\infty or -1. The zero ring is the only ring with a negative dimension. * A ring is Artinian if and only if it is Noetherian and its Krull dimension is ‚â§0. * An integral extension of a ring has the same dimension as the ring does. * Let R be an algebra over a field k that is an integral domain. Then the Krull dimension of R is less than or equal to the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of R over k.Krull dimension less or equal than transcendence degree? The equality holds if R is finitely generated as algebra (for instance by the noether normalization lemma). * Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal and \\\\operatorname{gr}_I(R) = \\\\oplus_0^\\\\infty I^k/I^{k+1} be the associated graded ring (geometers call it the ring of the normal cone of I.) Then \\\\operatorname{dim} \\\\operatorname{gr}_I(R) is the supremum of the heights of maximal ideals of R containing I. * A commutative Noetherian ring of Krull dimension zero is a direct product of a finite number (possibly one) of local rings of Krull dimension zero. * A Noetherian local ring is called a Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring if its dimension is equal to its depth. A regular local ring is an example of such a ring. * A Noetherian integral domain is a unique factorization domain if and only if every height 1 prime ideal is principal.Hartshorne,Robin:\\"Algebraic Geometry\\", page 7,1977 * For a commutative Noetherian ring the three following conditions are equivalent: being a reduced ring of Krull dimension zero, being a field or a direct product of fields, being von Neumann regular. Of a module If R is a commutative ring, and M is an R-module, we define the Krull dimension of M to be the Krull dimension of the quotient of R making M a faithful module. That is, we define it by the formula: :\\\\operatorname{dim}_R M := \\\\operatorname{dim}( R/\\\\operatorname{Ann}_R(M)) where AnnR(M), the annihilator, is the kernel of the natural map R ‚Üí EndR(M) of R into the ring of R-linear endomorphisms of M. In the language of schemes, finitely generated modules are interpreted as coherent sheaves, or generalized finite rank vector bundles. For non-commutative rings The Krull dimension of a module over a possibly non-commutative ring is defined as the deviation of the poset of submodules ordered by inclusion. For commutative Noetherian rings, this is the same as the definition using chains of prime ideals.McConnell, J.C. and Robson, J.C. Noncommutative Noetherian Rings (2001). Amer. Math. Soc., Providence. Corollary 6.4.8. The two definitions can be different for commutative rings which are not Noetherian.

The Japanese school uniform is modeled in appearance similar to that of the European-style naval uniforms and was first used in Japan in the late 19th century, replacing the traditional kimono. Today, school uniforms are common in many of the Japanese public and private school systems. The Japanese word for this type of uniform is . History The majority of Japan‚Äôs junior high and high schools require students to wear uniforms. The Japanese school uniform is not only a symbol of youth but also plays an important role in the country‚Äôs culture. There are many types of uniforms that range from standard to unique ones varying in the ensembles used. Japanese school uniforms have been around for 150 years. Its first model was similar to the appearance of European-style naval uniforms. It is called ‚Äúseifuku‚Äù in Japanese and was first used in the 19th century. The idea was taken from scaled-down sailor suits worn by children coming from royal European families. It was relatively easy to sew and thus was easily adopted in the country. Talking about junior and senior high school uniforms, the traditional attire was taken from the Meiji era consisting of military-style uniform for boys and sailor outfit for girls. After which, many schools adopted a more Western-pattern Catholic uniform style. Girls started wearing white blouses with ties, blazers with their school crests, and skirts. Boys also wore white shirts with ties, blazers, and tailored trousers. Schools in Japan do not have gender-exclusive locker rooms; thus, it is quite difficult to change from classroom uniforms into sports uniforms. As a result, most students wear their sports uniforms under their classroom uniforms. Some schools are very particular with the hairstyles as well as the footwear, too. Traditionally, school uniforms were worn outside of school, but these days, students change into casual clothing upon going out of school. The gakuran and sailor-style dress have always been a part of Japan's \\"growing modern\\" culture due to its formal appearance and its existence as a concept. Old-fashioned textbooks state that the uniforms were based on the Imperial Japanese Army uniform rather than the European uniforms. The sides of the uniform are similar to existing styles of Japanese dressmaking and the collar had straight lines. Many home economics classes in Japan up until the 1950s gave sewing sailor outfits as assignments. Girls sewed sailor outfits for younger children in their communities. In the 1980s, sukeban gangs began modifying uniforms by making skirts longer and shortening the tops, and so schools began switching to blazer or sweater vest style uniforms to try to combat the effect. As of 2012, 50% of Japanese junior high schools and 20% of senior high schools use sailor suit uniforms.The Asahi Shimbun stated in 2012 that, \\"The sailor suit is changing from adorable and cute, a look that 'appeals to the boys,' to a uniform that 'girls like to wear for themselves.'\\" As of that year, contemporary sailor suits have front closures with zippers or snaps and more constructed bodices. The Asahi Shimbun stated that \\"[t]he form is snug to enhance the figure‚Äîthe small collar helps the head look smaller, for better balance.\\" Usage In almost all schools, Japanese students are required to take off the shoes they wear outdoors and wear different indoor shoes. At some schools, students wear uwabaki, a kind of soft slipper meant to be used only indoors. The Japanese junior and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a military-styled uniform for boys and a sailor outfit for girls. These uniforms are based on Meiji era formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfits replace the undivided hakama (andon bakama Ë°åÁÅØË¢¥) designed by Utako Shimoda between 1920 and 1930.Âà∂Êúç„Åß„Åü„Å©„ÇãÁôæÂπ¥ While this style of uniform is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern catholic school uniform styles. These uniforms consist of a white shirt, tie, blazer with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same color as the blazer) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and tartan culottes or skirt for girls. Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version of the uniform (usually consisting of just a white dress shirt and the uniform slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year- round use and a T-shirt and short pants for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of any particular school, students may often wear different seasonal and activity uniforms within the same classroom during the day. Individual students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing their uniforms incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large loose socks or badges. Girls may shorten their skirts, permanently or by wrapping up the top to decrease length; boys may wear trousers about the hips, omit ties, or keep their shirts unbuttoned. Since some schools do not have sex-segregated changing- or locker-rooms, students may change for sporting activities in their classrooms. As a result, such students may wear their sports uniforms under their classroom uniforms. Certain schools also regulate student hairstyles, footwear, and book bags; but these particular rules are usually adhered to only on special occasions, such as trimester opening and closing ceremonies and school photo days. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas, but this is going out of fashion and many students wear casual dress outside of school.\\"Uniforms - The Japanese Fashion Everyone Loves\\" (April 2011). Hiragana Times, Volume 294, pp. 12‚Äì15. While not many public elementary schools in Japan require uniforms, many private schools and public schools run by the central government still do so. Gakuran Museum exhibit of the uniforms of the Ichikawa Gakuen school. The middle mannequin is displaying a gakuran. The and the are the uniforms for many middle-school and high-school boys in Japan. The color is normally black, but some schools use navy blue. The top has a standing collar buttoning down from top-to-bottom. Buttons are usually decorated with the school emblem to show respect to the school. Pants are straight leg and a black or dark-colored belt is worn with them. Boys usually wear penny loafers or sneakers with this uniform. Some schools may require the students to wear collar-pins representing the school and/or class rank. Traditionally, the gakuran is also worn along with a matching (usually black) student cap, although this custom is less common in modern times. The gakuran is derived from the Prussian Waffenrock. The term is a combination of gaku (Â≠¶) meaning \\"study\\" or \\"student\\", and ran („Çâ„Çì or Ëò≠) meaning the Netherlands or, historically in Japan, the West in general; thus, gakuran translates as \\"Western style clothes for student (uniform)\\".The original model of the present days Gakuran was first established in 1886 for the students of Tokyo University. During the Japanese occupation, such clothing was also brought to school in South Korea and pre-1949 China. Nowadays, the gakuran is still being worn by some South Korean students. Sailor fuku A group of Japanese schoolgirls in sailor suits The is a common style of uniform worn by female middle school students, traditionally by high school students, and occasionally, elementary school students. It was introduced as a school uniform in 1920 in Â•≥Â≠êÁîüÂæí„Å´Ê¥ãË£ÖÂà∂ÊúçÁôªÂ†¥„ÄÅÂ§ßÊ≠£„É¢„ÉÄ„É≥ and 1921 by the principal of ,Âπ≥ÂÆâÂ•≥Â≠¶Èô¢Ôºà‰∫¨ÈÉΩÔºâ„Å®Á¶èÂ≤°Â•≥Â≠¶Èô¢ÔºàÁ¶èÂ≤°Ôºâ„ÅÆÈñì„Åß„ÄÅ„Çª„Éº„É©„ÉºÊúç„ÅÆËµ∑Ê∫ê„ÇíÂ∑°„ÇãË´ñ‰∫â„ÅåÂãÉÁô∫ÔºÅ Elizabeth Lee. It was modeled after the uniform used by the British Royal Navy at the time, which Lee had experienced as an exchange student in the United Kingdom. Much like the male uniform, the gakuran, the sailor outfits bears a similarity to various military styled naval uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a blouse attached with a sailor-style collar and a pleated skirt. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include neckties, bolo ties, neckerchiefs, and bows. Common colors are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black. Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. These socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black penny loafers. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as loose socks, knee- length stockings, or similar) are also commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits. The sailor uniform today is generally associated solely with junior high schools, since a majority of high schools have changed to more Western-style plaid skirts or blazers. LGBT considerations The attire is gender-specific and the two options, male or female, are dispensed to students according to the gender they were assigned at birth. \\"The idea behind the uniform is that if you can‚Äôt wear it properly, you're a bad student,\\" said Mameta Endo, a trans male LGBT activist from Tokyo. \\"It makes you an outcast.\\" In 2015, Japan's Ministry of Education issued a directive that suggested teachers should \\"accept students' preference of outfit, school and gym uniform.\\" Implementation has been piecemeal but appears to be gaining traction in some schools, sparking discussions in local school boards and governments. The education ministry followed its 2015 directive with a \\"guidebook\\" for teachers in 2016. That same year, Japan, along with the United States and the Netherlands, led a UNESCO conference about homophobic bullying in schools, and in March 2017, the ministry announced it had revised the national bullying prevention policy to include LGBT students. School officials hope the move will ease the mental anguish of such students, who are usually required to wear gender-based uniforms typified by jackets with stand-up collars and trousers for boys, and sailor-type outfits with skirts for girls. At Kashiwanoha Junior High School, which opened in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture in April, students can freely choose whether to wear skirts or slacks or ties or ribbons with blazers, regardless of their sex. Originally, the school did not intend to make students wear a uniform, but had to change course because nearly 90% of parents and prospective students surveyed wanted one. A panel of parents, teachers, prospective students, and education board members was set up to discuss the uniform designs. Some said consideration should be paid to LGBT students and that girls should also be allowed to wear trousers because they are more practical and warmer in winter. Cultural significance Various schools are known for their particular uniforms. School uniforms can have a nostalgic characteristic for former students, and are often associated with relatively carefree youth. Uniforms are sometimes modified by students as a means of exhibiting individualism, including lengthening or shortening the skirt, removing the ribbon, hiding patches or badges under the collar, etc. In past decades, brightly coloured variants of the sailor outfits were also adopted by Japanese yankii, sukeban and B≈çs≈çzoku biker gangs.Grigsby, Mary (1998). \\"Sailormoon: Manga (Comics) and Anime (Cartoon) Superheroine Meets Barbie: Global Entertainment Commodity Comes to the United States\\".

Context and definitions The Line of Control divides the Pakistan- controlled Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and the Indian-controlled union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The Line of Actual Control divides the China-controlled Aksai Chin and the Indian-controlled union territory of Ladakh. Territorial disputes are often related to the possession of natural resources such as rivers, fertile farmland, mineral or petroleum resources although the disputes can also be driven by culture, religion, and ethnic nationalism. Territorial disputes often result from vague and unclear language in a treaty that set up the original boundary. Territorial disputes are a major cause of wars and terrorism, as states often try to assert their sovereignty over a territory through invasion, and non-state entities try to influence the actions of politicians through terrorism. International law does not support the use of force by one state to annex the territory of another state. The UN Charter states, \\"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\\" In some cases in which the boundary is not demarcated, such as the Taiwan Strait, and Kashmir, the parties involved define a line of control, which serves as the de facto international border. *The term border dispute (or border conflict) applies to cases in which a limited territory is disputed by two or more states, each contending state would publish its own maps to include the same region which would invariably lie along or adjacent to the recognised borders of the competing states, such as the Abyei region which is contested between Sudan and South Sudan. With border conflicts, the existence of the rival state is not being challenged, such as the relationship between the Republic of China and People's Republic of China or the relationship between South Korea and North Korea, but each state recognise only the shape of the rival state as not containing the claimed territory, spite of who actually governs the land and how it is recognised in the international community.Map of the current buffer zone in Cyprus *An occupied territory, in general, is a region distinct from the recognized territory of the sovereign states but which the occupying state controls, usually with military forces. Sometimes, a long-term occupation is maintained as a means to act upon a territorial claim, but an occupation may also be strategic (such as creating a buffer zone or preventing a rival power obtaining control) or a means of coercion (such as a punishment, to impose some internal measures or for use as a bargaining chip). *The term irredentism applies to border disputes but also to wider territorial claims: #If a nation emerges when declaring independence from a larger state, its ultimate recognition may not always grant the new state control over the territory it proposed as part of the declaration. Those lands remain unredeemed territory in the eyes of nationalist movements from the state but do not otherwise cause a problem between the governments on each side of the border. #In cases that territory was achieved through historical conquests such as an empire, traditionalists may view former colonies as unredeemed territory. Basis in international law Territorial disputes have significant meaning in the international society, both by their relation to the fundamental right of states, sovereignty and also because they are important for international peace. International law has significant relations with territorial disputes because territorial disputes tackles the basis of international law; the state territory. International law is based on the persons of international law, which requires a defined territory, as mentioned in the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States. Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention declares that \\"a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States\\" http://www.idpsrilanka.lk/Doc/International%20Human%20Rights%20Instruments/Montevideo%20Convention%20on%20the%20Rights%20and%20Duties%20of%20States.pdf Also, B. T. Sumner's article mentions, \\"In international law and relations, ownership of territory is significant because sovereignty over land defines what constitutes a state.\\" Therefore, the breach of a country's borders or territorial disputes pose a threat to a state's very sovereignty and the right as a person of international law. In addition, territorial disputes are sometimes brought to the International Court of Justice, as was the case in Costa Rica and Nicaragua (2005). Territorial disputes cannot be separated from international law, whose basis is on the law of state borders, and their potential settlement also relies on international law and the Court.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have used bandanas for protection instead of face masks. The popularity of head kerchiefs may vary by culture or religion, and may vary among Orthodox Jewish and Christian, Catholic, Amish, and Muslim people. The neckerchief and handkerchief are related items. Types Bandana A man wearing a red bandana A bandana or bandanna (from Sanskrit ‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§® or bandhana, \\"a bond\\") is a type of large, usually colourful kerchief, originating from the Indian subcontinent, often worn on the head or around the neck of a person. It is considered to be a hat by some. Bandanas are frequently printed in a paisley pattern and are most often used to hold hair back, either as a fashionable head accessory, or for practical purposes. It is also used to tie around the neck to prevent sunburn, and around the mouth and nose to protect from dust inhalation or to hide the identity of its wearer. Bandanas originated in India as bright coloured handkerchiefs of silk and cotton with spots in white on coloured grounds, chiefly red and blue Bandhani. The silk styles were made of the finest quality yarns, and were popular. Bandana prints for clothing were first produced in Glasgow from cotton yarns, and are now made in many qualities. The term, at present, generally means a fabric in printed styles, whether silk, silk and cotton, or all cotton. The word bandana stems from the Hindi words 'bƒÅndhn≈´,' or \\"tie-dyeing,\\" and 'bƒÅndhnƒÅ,' \\"to tie.\\" These stem from Sanskrit roots 'badhnƒÅti,' \\"he ties,\\" and Sanskrit 'bandhana' (‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§®), \\"a bond.\\" In the 18th and 19th centuries bandanas were frequently known as bandannoes.Yule and Burnell (2013), \\"Bandanna\\", p.78.

He is the older twin brother of Abel and the son of Adam and Eve, the first couple within the Biblical tale. He was a farmer who gave an offering of his crops to God with which God was not pleased and favored Abel's over Cain. Out of jealousy he then killed his brother, which lead to the punishment as the curse and mark of Cain. He had various offsprings starting with Enoch including Lamech. His lineage would later be wiped out after the Flood within the narrative. The narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive for murdering his brother, nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and the first murderer.  Genesis narrative  Interpretations  Jewish and Christian interpretations  One question arising early in the story is why God rejected Cain's sacrifice. It is never stated whether or not Cain had received specific instructions on how to sacrifice correctly, nor does the text indicate what, if anything, he did wrong. It is also unclear why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin. The Midrash suggest that although Abel brought the best meat from his flock, Cain did not set aside for God the best of his harvest.Doukhan 2016, pp. 57, 61. Curse and Mark According to the Book of Genesis, Cain ( Q√°yin, in pausa QƒÅÃÅyin; K√°√Øn;Novum Testamentum Graece (NA27): , , Ethiopian version: Qayen; , QƒÅbƒ´l) is the first child of Eve, the first murderer, and the third human being to fall under a curse. According to , Cain treacherously murdered his brother Abel, lied about the murder to God, and as a result was cursed and marked for life. With the earth left cursed to drink Abel's blood, Cain was no longer able to farm the land. Cain is punished as a \\"fugitive and wanderer\\". He receives a mark from God, commonly referred to as the mark of Cain, representing God's promise to protect Cain from being murdered. Exegesis of the Septuagint's narrative, \\"groaning and shaking upon the earth\\" has Cain suffering from body tremors. Interpretations extend Cain's curse to his descendants, where they all died in the Great Deluge as retribution for the loss of Abel's potential offspring. Islamic interpretation  Etymology  The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve by William Blake, 1826 One popular theory regarding the name of Cain connects it to the verb \\"kana\\" ( qnh), meaning \\"to get\\" and used by Eve in when she says after bearing Cain, \\"I have gotten a man from the Lord.\\" In this viewpoint, articulated by Nachmanides in the thirteenth century, Cain's name presages his role of mastery, power, and sin.Doukhan 2016, p. 59. In one of the Legends of the Jews, Cain is the fruit of a union between Eve and Satan, who is also the angel Samael and the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and Eve exclaims at Cain's birth, \\"I have gotten a man through an angel of the Lord.\\"Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Vol I: The Ten Generations ‚Äì The Birth of Cain (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. According to the Life of Adam and Eve (c. 1st century CE), Cain fetched his mother a reed (qaneh) which is how he received his name Qayin (Cain). The symbolism of him fetching a reed may be a nod to his occupation as a farmer, as well as a commentary to his destructive nature. He is also described as \\"lustrous\\", which may reflect the Gnostic association of Cain with the sun.  Characteristics  Cain is described as a city-builder, and the forefather of tent-dwelling pastoralists, all lyre and pipe players, and bronze and iron smiths. In an alternate translation of Genesis 4:17, endorsed by a minority of modern commentators, Cain's son Enoch builds a city and names it after his son, Irad. Such a city could correspond with Eridu, one of the most ancient cities known.Byron 2011, pp. 124‚Äì25. Philo observes that it makes no sense for Cain, the third human on Earth, to have founded an actual city. Instead, he argues, the city symbolizes an unrighteous philosophy.Philo, Posterity of Cain lines 49‚Äì58 (from Works of Philo Judaeus, Vol. 1); quoted in Byron 2011, pp. 127‚Äì28. In the New Testament, Cain is cited as an example of unrighteousness in and . The Targumim, rabbinic sources, and later speculations supplemented background details for the daughters of Adam and Eve. Such exegesis of Genesis 4 introduced Cain's wife as being his sister, a concept that has been accepted for at least 1,800 years. This can be seen with Jubilees 4 which narrates that Cain settled down and married his sister Awan, who bore his first son, the first Enoch, approximately 196 years after the creation of Adam. Cain then establishes the first city, naming it after his son, builds a house, and lives there until it collapses on him, killing him.  Relationship with the ground  Speculation exists that the ground could play a more significant role in relation to early stories of Genesis, like Adam, Noah, and Cain. In this alternative reading of the text, the ground could be personified as a character. This reading is evidenced by given human qualities, like a mouth, in the scripture. The ground is also the only subject of an active verb in the verse that states, \\"It opens its mouth to take the blood.\\" This suggests that the ground reacted to the situation. By that logic, the ground could then potentially be an accomplice to the murder of Abel (Jordstad 708). The reaction from the ground raises the question, \\"does the intimate connection between humans and the ground mean that the ground mirrors or aids human action, regardless of the nature of that action?\\"  Other stories  In Jewish tradition, Philo, Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer and the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan asserted that Adam was not the father of Cain. Rather, Eve was subject to adultery having been seduced by either Sammael, the serpent (nahash, ) in the Garden of Eden,Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Vol. 1, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, , pp. 105‚Äì09 or the devil himself. Christian exegesis of the \\"evil one\\" in have also led some commentators, like Tertullian, to agree that Cain was the son of the devil or some fallen angel. Thus, according to some interpreters, Cain was half-human and half-angelic, one of the Nephilim. Gnostic exegesis in the Apocryphon of John has Eve seduced by Yaldaboth. However, in the Hypostasis of the Archons, Eve is raped by a pair of Archons. Pseudo-Philo, a Jewish work of the first century CE, narrates that Cain murdered his brother at the age of 15. After escaping to the Land of Nod, Cain fathered four sons: Enoch, Olad, Lizpha and Fosal; and two daughters: Citha and Maac. Cain died at the age of 730, leaving his corrupt descendants spreading evil on earth.Pseudo-Philo (Biblical Antiquities of Philo), chapter 1 According to the Book of Jubilees, Cain murdered his brother with a stone. Afterwards, Cain was killed by the same instrument he used against his brother; his house fell on him and he was killed by its stones.Jubilees 4:31 A heavenly law was cited after the narrative of Cain's death saying: > With the instrument with which a man kills his neighbour with the same shall > he be killed; after the manner that he wounded him, in like manner shall > they deal with him.Jubilees 4:32 A Talmudic tradition says that after Cain had murdered his brother, God made a horn grow on his head. Later, Cain was killed at the hands of his great grandson Lamech, who mistook him for a wild beast.Legends of the Jews, Louis Ginzberg ‚Äì Volume I A Christian version of this tradition from the time of the Crusades holds that the slaying of Cain by Lamech took place on a mound called \\"Cain Mons\\" (i.e. Mount Cain), which is a corruption of \\"Caymont\\", a Crusader fort in Tel Yokneam in modern-day Israel. The story of Cain and Abel is also made reference to in chapter 19 of 1 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. In this text, Cain killed Abel as he desired Abel's wife. According to the Mandaean scriptures including the QolastƒÅ, the Book of John and GenzƒÅ RabbƒÅ, Abel is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure Hibil Ziwa who taught John the Baptist. Family  Family tree  The following family tree of the line of Cain is compiled from a variety of biblical and extra-biblical texts.  Sisters/wives  Various early commentators have said that Cain and Abel have sisters, usually twin sisters. According to Rabbi Joshua ben Karha as quoted in Genesis Rabbah, \\"Only two entered the bed, and seven left it: Cain and his twin sister, Abel and his two twin sisters.\\"Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, Volume One, translated by Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman; London: Soncino Press, 1983; ; p. 180.Luttikhuizen 2003, pp. 36‚Äì39.  Motives  Glasgow Botanic Gardens. Kibble Palace. Edwin Roscoe Mullins ‚Äì Cain or My Punishment is Greater than I can Bear (Genesis 4:13), about 1899. The Book of Genesis does not give a specific reason for the murder of Abel. Modern commentators typically assume that the motives were jealousy and anger due to God rejecting Cain's offering, while accepting Abel's.: Anglea Y. Kim, \\"Cain and Abel in the Light of Envy: A Study of the History of the Interpretation of Envy in Genesis 4:1‚Äì16,\\" JSP (2001), pp. 65‚Äì84 The First Epistle of John says the following: Ancient exegetes, such as the Midrash and the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, tell that the motive involved a desire for the most beautiful woman. According to Midrashic tradition, Cain and Abel each had twin sisters; each was to marry the other's. The Midrash states that Abel's promised wife, Aclima, was more beautiful than Awan. Since Cain would not consent to this arrangement, Adam suggested seeking God's blessing by means of a sacrifice. Whoever God blessed would marry Aclima. When God openly rejected Cain's sacrifice, Cain slew his brother in a fit of jealousy and anger. Rabbinical exegetes have discussed whether Cain's incestuous relationship with his sister was in violation of halakha.  Legacy and symbolism  A millennia-old explanation for Cain being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or Satan himself, rather than being from Adam. A medieval legend has Cain arriving at the Moon, where he eternally settled with a bundle of twigs. This was originated by the popular fantasy of interpreting the shadows on the Moon as a face. An example of this belief can be found in Dante Alighieri's Inferno (XX, 126Dante, The Divine Comedy, Inferno, canto 20, line 126 and 127. The Dante Dartmouth Project contains the original text and centuries of commentary. :\\"For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine :On either hemisphere, touching the wave :Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight :The moon was round.\\" Also in Paradiso, canto 2, line 51. :But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots :Upon this body, which below on earth :Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\\" ) where the expression \\"Cain and the twigs\\" is used as a kenning for \\"moon\\". In Latter-day Saint theology, Cain is considered to be the quintessential Son of Perdition, the father of secret combinations (i.e. secret societies and organized crime), as well as the first to hold the title Master Mahan meaning master of [the] great secret, that [he] may murder and get gain.Moses 5:31 In Mormon folklore‚Äîa second-hand account relates that an early Mormon leader, David W. Patten, encountered a very tall, hairy, dark- skinned man in Tennessee who said that he was Cain. The account states that Cain had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men.Letter by Abraham O. Smoot, quoted in Lycurgus A. Wilson (1900).

Patten: Apostle and Martyr (Springville, Utah: Cedar Fort) p. 85. The recollection of Patten's story is quoted in Spencer W. Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness, a popular book within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Spencer W. Kimball (1969). The Miracle of Forgiveness (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, ) pp. 127‚Äì28. This widespread Mormon belief is further emphasized by an account from Salt Lake City in 1963 which stated that \\"One superstition is based on the old Mormon belief that Cain is a black man who wanders the earth begging people to kill him and take his curse upon themselves (M, 24, SLC, 1963).\\"Cannon, Anthon S., Wayland D.

Cain and Abel: The Prodigal Sons of Psychoanalysis? Universiteit Gent. There were other, minor traditions concerning Cain and Abel, of both older and newer date. The apocryphal Life of Adam and Eve tells of Eve having a dream in which Cain drank his brother's blood. In an attempt to prevent the prophecy from happening the two young men are separated and given different jobs.Williams, David: \\"Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory, p. 21. University of Toronto Press, 1982 The author Daniel Quinn, first in his book Ishmael and later in The Story of B, proposes that the story of Cain and Abel is an account of early Semitic herdsmen observing the beginnings of what he calls totalitarian agriculture, with Cain representing the first 'modern' agriculturists and Abel the pastoralists.

Typically children enter into the organization in elementary school and continue until adolescence. The adolescents then typically join the Young Communist League. Prior to the 1990s there was a wide cooperation between pioneer and similar movements of about 30 countries, coordinated by the international organization, International Committee of Children's and Adolescents' Movements (, CIMEA), founded in 1958, with headquarters in Budapest, Hungary. Overview Soviet Pioneer Organization with a silhouette of Vladimir Lenin and the inscription Always prepared! During the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1921, most of the Russian Scoutmasters and many Scouts fought in the ranks of the White Army against the Red Army. Between 1918 and 1920, the All-Russian Congresses of the Russian Union of the Communist Youth (Komsomol) decided to eradicate the Scout movement and create an organization of the communist type, that would take Soviet children and adolescents under its umbrella. This organization would resemble the Scout movement in its form but properly educate children with Communist teachings.Lewis Stegelbaum and Andrei Sokolov, Stalinism As A Way Of Life, p374 On behalf of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars, Nadezhda Krupskaya (Vladimir Lenin's wife and the People's Commissar of State for Education) was one of the main contributors to the cause of the Pioneer movement. In 1922, she wrote an essay called \\"Russian Union of the Communist Youth and boy-Scoutism.\\" However, it was the remaining scoutmasters themselves who supported the Komsomol and the Red Army, who introduced the name \\"Pioneer\\" to it and convinced the Komsomol to adapt the Scout symbols and rituals.

Later, similar organizations were founded in the countries of the Eastern Bloc and other Communist states. The Pioneer movement was modeled in many aspects on the Scout movement. The two movements share some principles like preparedness and promotion of sports and outdoor skills. The motto Always prepared! was adapted by the pioneer movement from the Scout Motto. red and blue neckerchiefs A member of the movement is known as a Pioneer, with the name stemming from the pioneering activity in Scouting. A neckerchief‚Äîtypically red, but sometimes light blue‚Äîis the traditional item of clothing worn by a pioneer. This tradition was adapted from the Scout uniform. But there are some distinct differences between the two movements. Most notably, the Scout movement is independent of government control and political parties. In contrast, the Pioneer movement is controlled by the Communist Party and includes teaching of communist principles. Opponents of Communism claim that this is a form of indoctrination. Pioneer movements have existed and still exist in countries where the Communist Party is in power as well as in some countries where the Communist Party is in opposition, if the party is large enough to support a children's organization. In countries ruled by Communist Parties, membership of the pioneer movement is officially optional. However, membership provides many benefits, so the vast majority of children typically join the movement (although at different ages). During the existence of the Soviet Union, thousands of Young Pioneer camps and Young Pioneer Palaces were built exclusively for Young Pioneers, which were free of charge, sponsored by the government and trade unions. There were many newspapers and magazines published for Young Pioneers in millions of copies. A national pioneer organization is often named after a famous party member that is considered a suitable role model for young communists, such as Vladimir Lenin in the Soviet Union, Enver Hoxha in Albania, Georgi Dimitrov in Bulgaria, Jos√© Mart√≠ in Cuba, Ernst Th√§lmann in East Germany, Damdin S√ºkhbaatar in Mongolia, and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.

The history of Styria concerns the region roughly corresponding to the modern Austrian state of Styria and the Slovene region of Styria (≈†tajerska) from its settlement by Germans and Slavs in the Dark Ages until the present. This mountainous and scenic region, which became a centre for mountaineering in the 19th century, is often called the \\"Green March\\", because half of the area is covered with forests and one quarter with meadows, grasslands, vineyards and orchards. Styria is also rich in minerals, soft coal and iron, which has been mined at Erzberg since the time of the Romans. The Slovene Hills (, ) is a famous wine- producing district, stretching between Slovenia and Austria. Styria was for long the most densely populated and productive mountain region in Europe. Styria's population before World War I was 68% German-speaking, 32% Slovene, bordered on (clockwise) Lower Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Carniola, Carinthia, Salzburg, and Upper Austria. In 1918 after World War I the southern, Slovene- speaking third south of the river Mur was incorporated into Slovenia in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The remaining two-thirds became the Austrian federal state of Styria, while the Slovene-speaking third (Lower Styria) formed the informal region of ≈†tajerska in Slovenia, now divided up into the statistical EU regions of Podravska, Savinjska and the major part of Slovenian Carinthia.\\"Clickable map of Slovenia\\" The capital both of the duchy and the Austrian state has always been Graz, which is now also the residence of the governor and the seat of the administration of the land. Political history Prehistory to Charlemagne The Roman history of Styria is as part of Noricum and Pannonia, with the romanized Celtic population of the Taurisci. During the great migrations, various Germanic tribes settled and/or traversed the region using the river valleys and low passes, but about 600 CE the Slavs took possession of the area and settled assimilating the remaining autochthonous romanized population. When Styria came under the hegemony of Charlemagne as a part of Carantania (Carinthia), erected as a border territory against the Avars and Slavs, there was a large influx of Bavarii and other Christianized Germanic peoples, whom the bishops of Salzburg and the patriarchs of Aquileia kept faithful to Rome. Bishop Vergilius of Salzburg (745-84), was largely instrumental in establishing a church hierarchy in the Duchy and gained for himself the name of \\"Apostle of Carantania.\\" In 811 Charlemagne made the Drave river the boundary between the Dioceses of Salzburg and Aquileia. Middle Ages The March of Styria was created in the Duchy of Carinthia in the late 10th century as a defence against the Magyars. Long called the Carantanian or Carinthian March it was soon ruled by a margravial dynasty called the Otakars that originated from Steyr in Upper Austria thus giving the land its name: \\"Steiermark\\". This march was raised to become a duchy by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1180 after the fall of Henry the Lion of Bavaria. With the death of Ottokar the first line of rulers of Styria became extinct; the region fell successively to the Babenberg family, rulers of Austria, as stipulated in the Georgenberg Pact; after their extinction to the control of Hungary (1254‚Äì60); to King Ottokar of Bohemia; in 1276 to the Habsburgs, who provided it with Habsburgs for Styrian dukes during the years 1379-1439 and 1564‚Äì1619. At the time of the Ottoman invasions in the 16th and 17th centuries the land suffered severely and was depopulated. The Turks made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times; churches, monasteries, cities, and villages were destroyed and plundered, while the population was either killed or carried away into slavery. Modern era Historical view of the border between Styria and Carinthia, 1830 The Semmering Railway, completed in 1854, was a triumph of engineering in its time, the oldest of the great European mountain railways. It was remarkable for its numerous and long tunnels and viaducts spanning mountain valleys, running from Gloggnitz in Lower Austria to M√ºrzzuschlag in Styria, and passing through the area's scenery. The railway brought tourists to alpine lake resorts and mineral springs at Rohitsch (today's Roga≈°ka Slatina) and Bad Gleichenberg, the brine springs of Bad Aussee, and the thermal springs of Tuffer (today's La≈°ko), Neuhaus am Klausenbach and Tobelbad. Following World War I, Styria was divided by the Treaty of Saint Germain. Lower Styria with the cities of Celje and Maribor became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, while the rest remained with Austria as the State of Styria. Other than in Carinthia, no fighting resulted from this, in spite of a German minority in Slovenia (the larger cities of Lower Styria were largely German-speaking). Lower Styria was reattached to the Reichsgau Steiermark from 1942 to 1945, whence it was returned to Germany. After World War II, Styria became part of the British occupation zone Austria. The lower third was granted to Yugoslavia and today, it makes up about the eastern third of Slovenia. Religious history The Protestant Reformation made its way into the country about 1530. Duke Karl (ruling 1564-90), whose wife was the Catholic Duchess Maria of Bavaria, introduced the Counter-Reformation into the country; in 1573 he invited the Jesuits into Styria and in 1586 he founded the Catholic University of Graz. In 1598 his son and successor Ferdinand suppressed all Protestant schools and expelled the teachers and preachers: Protestant doctrines were maintained only in a few isolated mountain valleys, as in the valley of the Inn and the valley of the Mur. On a narrow reading of the Peace of Augsburg, 1555, with its principle of cuius regio, eius religio, only the nobility were not forced to return to the Roman Church; each could have Protestant services privately in his own house. After Ferdinand had become Holy Roman Emperor in 1619 and had defeated his Protestant opponents in the Battle of White Mountain near Prague in 1620, he forbade all Protestant church services whatsoever (1625). In 1628 he commanded the nobility also to return to the Catholic faith. A large number of noble families, consequently, emigrated from the country. But most of them either returned, or their descendants did so, becoming Catholics and recovering their possessions. In the second half of the 17th century renewed action against the Protestants in the isolated mountain valleys resulted in the expulsion of Protestant ministers with the peasants who would not give up Protestantism; about 30,000 chose compulsory emigration to Transylvania over conversion. Only an Edict of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II as late as 1781 put an end to religious repression. The Protestants then received the right to found parish communities and to exercise their religion in those enclaves undisturbed. In 1848, all the provinces of the Habsburg Monarchy received complete liberty of religion and of conscience, parity of religions, and the right to the public exercise of religion. Ecclesiastically the province was historically divided into two Catholic prince-bishoprics, Seckau and Lavant. From the time of their foundation both were suffragans of the Archdiocese of Salzburg. The Prince-Bishopric of Seckau was established in 1218; since 1786 the see of the prince-bishop has been Graz. The Prince- Bishopric of Lavant with its bishop's seat at Sankt Andr√§ in the Carinthian Lavant valley was founded as a bishopric in 1228 and raised to a prince- bishopric in 1446. In 1847 the bishop's seat was transferred from St. Andr√§ to Marburg an der Drau (Maribor), and after World War I the see's boundaries were adapted to the new political frontiers. A short-lived third Salzburg suffragan diocese of Leoben comprising 157 parishes in the districts of Leoben and Bruck an der Mur existed on Styrian soil from 1786 but was incorporated into the diocese of Graz-Seckau in 1856History of Graz-Seckau diocese. Retrieved 31 July 2010. Today the see of the bishop of Graz-Seckau is identical in territory with the Austrian State of Styria.

The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution. In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean‚ÄìVlasov processes, kinetic models of gases). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo-based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \\"soft\\" methods. In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parametrized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler. In other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean‚ÄìVlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain. A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies these mean field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.  Overview  Monte Carlo methods vary, but tend to follow a particular pattern: # Define a domain of possible inputs # Generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution over the domain # Perform a deterministic computation on the inputs # Aggregate the results Monte Carlo method applied to approximating the value of . For example, consider a quadrant (circular sector) inscribed in a unit square. Given that the ratio of their areas is , the value of can be approximated using a Monte Carlo method: # Draw a square, then inscribe a quadrant within it # Uniformly scatter a given number of points over the square # Count the number of points inside the quadrant, i.e. having a distance from the origin of less than 1 # The ratio of the inside-count and the total-sample-count is an estimate of the ratio of the two areas, . Multiply the result by 4 to estimate . In this procedure the domain of inputs is the square that circumscribes the quadrant. We generate random inputs by scattering grains over the square then perform a computation on each input (test whether it falls within the quadrant). Aggregating the results yields our final result, the approximation of . There are two important considerations: # If the points are not uniformly distributed, then the approximation will be poor. # There are many points. The approximation is generally poor if only a few points are randomly placed in the whole square. On average, the approximation improves as more points are placed. Uses of Monte Carlo methods require large amounts of random numbers, and it was their use that spurred the development of pseudorandom number generators, which were far quicker to use than the tables of random numbers that had been previously used for statistical sampling.  History  Before the Monte Carlo method was developed, simulations tested a previously understood deterministic problem, and statistical sampling was used to estimate uncertainties in the simulations. Monte Carlo simulations invert this approach, solving deterministic problems using probabilistic metaheuristics (see simulated annealing). An early variant of the Monte Carlo method was devised to solve the Buffon's needle problem, in which can be estimated by dropping needles on a floor made of parallel equidistant strips. In the 1930s, Enrico Fermi first experimented with the Monte Carlo method while studying neutron diffusion, but he did not publish this work. In the late 1940s, Stanislaw Ulam invented the modern version of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Immediately after Ulam's breakthrough, John von Neumann understood its importance. Von Neumann programmed the ENIAC computer to perform Monte Carlo calculations. In 1946, nuclear weapons physicists at Los Alamos were investigating neutron diffusion in fissionable material. Despite having most of the necessary data, such as the average distance a neutron would travel in a substance before it collided with an atomic nucleus and how much energy the neutron was likely to give off following a collision, the Los Alamos physicists were unable to solve the problem using conventional, deterministic mathematical methods. Ulam proposed using random experiments. He recounts his inspiration as follows: Being secret, the work of von Neumann and Ulam required a code name. A colleague of von Neumann and Ulam, Nicholas Metropolis, suggested using the name Monte Carlo, which refers to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco where Ulam's uncle would borrow money from relatives to gamble. Using lists of \\"truly random\\" random numbers was extremely slow, but von Neumann developed a way to calculate pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods that could be subtly incorrect. Monte Carlo methods were central to the simulations required for the Manhattan Project, though severely limited by the computational tools at the time. In the 1950s they were used at Los Alamos for early work relating to the development of the hydrogen bomb, and became popularized in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, and operations research. The Rand Corporation and the U.S. Air Force were two of the major organizations responsible for funding and disseminating information on Monte Carlo methods during this time, and they began to find a wide application in many different fields. The theory of more sophisticated mean field type particle Monte Carlo methods had certainly started by the mid-1960s, with the work of Henry P. McKean Jr. on Markov interpretations of a class of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics. We also quote an earlier pioneering article by Theodore E. Harris and Herman Kahn, published in 1951, using mean field genetic-type Monte Carlo methods for estimating particle transmission energies. Mean field genetic type Monte Carlo methodologies are also used as heuristic natural search algorithms (a.k.a. metaheuristic) in evolutionary computing. The origins of these mean field computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the work of Alan Turing on genetic type mutation- selection learning machines and the articles by Nils Aall Barricelli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Quantum Monte Carlo, and more specifically diffusion Monte Carlo methods can also be interpreted as a mean field particle Monte Carlo approximation of Feynman‚ÄìKac path integrals. The origins of Quantum Monte Carlo methods are often attributed to Enrico Fermi and Robert Richtmyer who developed in 1948 a mean field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions, but the first heuristic-like and genetic type particle algorithm (a.k.a. Resampled or Reconfiguration Monte Carlo methods) for estimating ground state energies of quantum systems (in reduced matrix models) is due to Jack H. Hetherington in 1984 In molecular chemistry, the use of genetic heuristic-like particle methodologies (a.k.a. pruning and enrichment strategies) can be traced back to 1955 with the seminal work of Marshall N. Rosenbluth and Arianna W. Rosenbluth. The use of Sequential Monte Carlo in advanced signal processing and Bayesian inference is more recent. It was in 1993, that Gordon et al., published in their seminal work the first application of a Monte Carlo resampling algorithm in Bayesian statistical inference. The authors named their algorithm 'the bootstrap filter', and demonstrated that compared to other filtering methods, their bootstrap algorithm does not require any assumption about that state-space or the noise of the system. We also quote another pioneering article in this field of Genshiro Kitagawa on a related \\"Monte Carlo filter\\", and the ones by Pierre Del Moral and Himilcon Carvalho, Pierre Del Moral, Andr√© Monin and G√©rard Salut on particle filters published in the mid-1990s. Particle filters were also developed in signal processing in 1989‚Äì1992 by P. Del Moral, J. C. Noyer, G. Rigal, and G. Salut in the LAAS-CNRS in a series of restricted and classified research reports with STCAN (Service Technique des Constructions et Armes Navales), the IT company DIGILOG, and the LAAS-CNRS (the Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems) on radar/sonar and GPS signal processing problems.P.

These Sequential Monte Carlo methodologies can be interpreted as an acceptance-rejection sampler equipped with an interacting recycling mechanism. From 1950 to 1996, all the publications on Sequential Monte Carlo methodologies, including the pruning and resample Monte Carlo methods introduced in computational physics and molecular chemistry, present natural and heuristic-like algorithms applied to different situations without a single proof of their consistency, nor a discussion on the bias of the estimates and on genealogical and ancestral tree based algorithms. The mathematical foundations and the first rigorous analysis of these particle algorithms were written by Pierre Del Moral in 1996. Branching type particle methodologies with varying population sizes were also developed in the end of the 1990s by Dan Crisan, Jessica Gaines and Terry Lyons, and by Dan Crisan, Pierre Del Moral and Terry Lyons. Further developments in this field were developed in 2000 by P. Del Moral, A. Guionnet and L. Miclo. Definitions There is no consensus on how Monte Carlo should be defined. For example, Ripley defines most probabilistic modeling as stochastic simulation, with Monte Carlo being reserved for Monte Carlo integration and Monte Carlo statistical tests. Sawilowsky distinguishes between a simulation, a Monte Carlo method, and a Monte Carlo simulation: a simulation is a fictitious representation of reality, a Monte Carlo method is a technique that can be used to solve a mathematical or statistical problem, and a Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated sampling to obtain the statistical properties of some phenomenon (or behavior). Examples: *Simulation: Drawing one pseudo-random uniform variable from the interval [0,1] can be used to simulate the tossing of a coin: If the value is less than or equal to 0.50 designate the outcome as heads, but if the value is greater than 0.50 designate the outcome as tails. This is a simulation, but not a Monte Carlo simulation. *Monte Carlo method: Pouring out a box of coins on a table, and then computing the ratio of coins that land heads versus tails is a Monte Carlo method of determining the behavior of repeated coin tosses, but it is not a simulation. *Monte Carlo simulation: Drawing a large number of pseudo-random uniform variables from the interval [0,1] at one time, or once at many different times, and assigning values less than or equal to 0.50 as heads and greater than 0.50 as tails, is a Monte Carlo simulation of the behavior of repeatedly tossing a coin. Kalos and Whitlock point out that such distinctions are not always easy to maintain. For example, the emission of radiation from atoms is a natural stochastic process. It can be simulated directly, or its average behavior can be described by stochastic equations that can themselves be solved using Monte Carlo methods. \\"Indeed, the same computer code can be viewed simultaneously as a 'natural simulation' or as a solution of the equations by natural sampling.\\" Monte Carlo and random numbers The main idea behind this method is that the results are computed based on repeated random sampling and statistical analysis. The Monte Carlo simulation is, in fact, random experimentations, in the case that, the results of these experiments are not well known. Monte Carlo simulations are typically characterized by many unknown parameters, many of which are difficult to obtain experimentally. Monte Carlo simulation methods do not always require truly random numbers to be useful (although, for some applications such as primality testing, unpredictability is vital). Many of the most useful techniques use deterministic, pseudorandom sequences, making it easy to test and re-run simulations. The only quality usually necessary to make good simulations is for the pseudo-random sequence to appear \\"random enough\\" in a certain sense. What this means depends on the application, but typically they should pass a series of statistical tests. Testing that the numbers are uniformly distributed or follow another desired distribution when a large enough number of elements of the sequence are considered is one of the simplest and most common ones. Weak correlations between successive samples are also often desirable/necessary. Sawilowsky lists the characteristics of a high-quality Monte Carlo simulation: *the (pseudo-random) number generator has certain characteristics (e.g. a long \\"period\\" before the sequence repeats) *the (pseudo-random) number generator produces values that pass tests for randomness *there are enough samples to ensure accurate results *the proper sampling technique is used *the algorithm used is valid for what is being modeled *it simulates the phenomenon in question. Pseudo-random number sampling algorithms are used to transform uniformly distributed pseudo-random numbers into numbers that are distributed according to a given probability distribution. Low-discrepancy sequences are often used instead of random sampling from a space as they ensure even coverage and normally have a faster order of convergence than Monte Carlo simulations using random or pseudorandom sequences. Methods based on their use are called quasi-Monte Carlo methods. In an effort to assess the impact of random number quality on Monte Carlo simulation outcomes, astrophysical researchers tested cryptographically-secure pseudorandom numbers generated via Intel's RDRAND instruction set, as compared to those derived from algorithms, like the Mersenne Twister, in Monte Carlo simulations of radio flares from brown dwarfs. RDRAND is the closest pseudorandom number generator to a true random number generator. No statistically significant difference was found between models generated with typical pseudorandom number generators and RDRAND for trials consisting of the generation of 107 random numbers. =Mersenne_twister (MT19937) in Python (a Monte Carlo method simulation)= A Monte Carlo method simulation is defined as any method that utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to many topics including quantum chromodynamics, cancer radiation therapy, traffic flow, stellar evolution and VLSI design. All these simulations require the use of random numbers and therefore pseudorandom number generators, which makes creating random-like numbers very important. A simple example of how a computer would perform a Monte Carlo simulation is the calculation of œÄ. If a square enclosed a circle and a point were randomly chosen inside the square the point would either lie inside the circle or outside it. If the process were repeated many times, the ratio of the random points that lie inside the circle to the total number of random points in the square would approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. From this we can estimate pi, as shown in the Python code below utilizing a SciPy package to generate pseudorandom numbers with the MT19937 algorithm. Note that this method is a computationally inefficient way to numerically approximate œÄ. import scipy N = 100000 x_array = scipy.random.rand(N) y_array = scipy.random.rand(N) # generate N pseudorandom independent x and y-values on interval [0,1) N_qtr_circle = sum(x_array  2 + y_array  2 < 1) # Number of pts within the quarter circle x^2 + y^2 < 1 centered at the origin with radius r=1. # True area of quarter circle is pi/4 and has N_qtr_circle points within it. # True area of the square is 1 and has N points within it, hence we approximate pi with pi_approx = 4 * float(N_qtr_circle) / N # Typical values: 3.13756, 3.15156  Monte Carlo simulation versus \\"what if\\" scenarios  There are ways of using probabilities that are definitely not Monte Carlo simulations ‚Äì for example, deterministic modeling using single-point estimates. Each uncertain variable within a model is assigned a \\"best guess\\" estimate. Scenarios (such as best, worst, or most likely case) for each input variable are chosen and the results recorded. By contrast, Monte Carlo simulations sample from a probability distribution for each variable to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes. The results are analyzed to get probabilities of different outcomes occurring. For example, a comparison of a spreadsheet cost construction model run using traditional \\"what if\\" scenarios, and then running the comparison again with Monte Carlo simulation and triangular probability distributions shows that the Monte Carlo analysis has a narrower range than the \\"what if\\" analysis. This is because the \\"what if\\" analysis gives equal weight to all scenarios (see quantifying uncertainty in corporate finance), while the Monte Carlo method hardly samples in the very low probability regions. The samples in such regions are called \\"rare events\\". Applications Monte Carlo methods are especially useful for simulating phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs and systems with many coupled degrees of freedom. Areas of application include: Physical sciences Monte Carlo methods are very important in computational physics, physical chemistry, and related applied fields, and have diverse applications from complicated quantum chromodynamics calculations to designing heat shields and aerodynamic forms as well as in modeling radiation transport for radiation dosimetry calculations. In statistical physics Monte Carlo molecular modeling is an alternative to computational molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods are used to compute statistical field theories of simple particle and polymer systems. Quantum Monte Carlo methods solve the many-body problem for quantum systems. In radiation materials science, the binary collision approximation for simulating ion implantation is usually based on a Monte Carlo approach to select the next colliding atom. In experimental particle physics, Monte Carlo methods are used for designing detectors, understanding their behavior and comparing experimental data to theory. In astrophysics, they are used in such diverse manners as to model both galaxy evolution and microwave radiation transmission through a rough planetary surface. Monte Carlo methods are also used in the ensemble models that form the basis of modern weather forecasting. Engineering Monte Carlo methods are widely used in engineering for sensitivity analysis and quantitative probabilistic analysis in process design. The need arises from the interactive, co-linear and non-linear behavior of typical process simulations. For example, * In microelectronics engineering, Monte Carlo methods are applied to analyze correlated and uncorrelated variations in analog and digital integrated circuits. * In geostatistics and geometallurgy, Monte Carlo methods underpin the design of mineral processing flowsheets and contribute to quantitative risk analysis. * In wind energy yield analysis, the predicted energy output of a wind farm during its lifetime is calculated giving different levels of uncertainty (P90, P50, etc.) * impacts of pollution are simulated and diesel compared with petrol. * In fluid dynamics, in particular rarefied gas dynamics, where the Boltzmann equation is solved for finite Knudsen number fluid flows using the direct simulation Monte CarloG. A. Bird, Molecular Gas Dynamics, Clarendon, Oxford (1976) method in combination with highly efficient computational algorithms. * In autonomous robotics, Monte Carlo localization can determine the position of a robot. It is often applied to stochastic filters such as the Kalman filter or particle filter that forms the heart of the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithm. * In telecommunications, when planning a wireless network, design must be proved to work for a wide variety of scenarios that depend mainly on the number of users, their locations and the services they want to use. Monte Carlo methods are typically used to generate these users and their states. The network performance is then evaluated and, if results are not satisfactory, the network design goes through an optimization process. * In reliability engineering, Monte Carlo simulation is used to compute system-level response given the component-level response. For example, for a transportation network subject to an earthquake event, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the k-terminal reliability of the network given the failure probability of its components, e.g. bridges, roadways, etc. * In signal processing and Bayesian inference, particle filters and sequential Monte Carlo techniques are a class of mean field particle methods for sampling and computing the posterior distribution of a signal process given some noisy and partial observations using interacting empirical measures. Climate change and radiative forcing The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change relies on Monte Carlo methods in probability density function analysis of radiative forcing. Computational biology Monte Carlo methods are used in various fields of computational biology, for example for Bayesian inference in phylogeny, or for studying biological systems such as genomes, proteins,, or membranes. The systems can be studied in the coarse- grained or ab initio frameworks depending on the desired accuracy. Computer simulations allow us to monitor the local environment of a particular molecule to see if some chemical reaction is happening for instance. In cases where it is not feasible to conduct a physical experiment, thought experiments can be conducted (for instance: breaking bonds, introducing impurities at specific sites, changing the local/global structure, or introducing external fields). Computer graphics Path tracing, occasionally referred to as Monte Carlo ray tracing, renders a 3D scene by randomly tracing samples of possible light paths. Repeated sampling of any given pixel will eventually cause the average of the samples to converge on the correct solution of the rendering equation, making it one of the most physically accurate 3D graphics rendering methods in existence. Applied statistics The standards for Monte Carlo experiments in statistics were set by Sawilowsky. In applied statistics, Monte Carlo methods may be used for at least four purposes: #To compare competing statistics for small samples under realistic data conditions. Although type I error and power properties of statistics can be calculated for data drawn from classical theoretical distributions (e.g., normal curve, Cauchy distribution) for asymptotic conditions (i. e, infinite sample size and infinitesimally small treatment effect), real data often do not have such distributions. #To provide implementations of hypothesis tests that are more efficient than exact tests such as permutation tests (which are often impossible to compute) while being more accurate than critical values for asymptotic distributions. #To provide a random sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. This sample then approximates and summarizes all the essential features of the posterior. #To provide efficient random estimates of the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function that may be averaged to form an estimate of the Fisher information matrix. Monte Carlo methods are also a compromise between approximate randomization and permutation tests. An approximate randomization test is based on a specified subset of all permutations (which entails potentially enormous housekeeping of which permutations have been considered). The Monte Carlo approach is based on a specified number of randomly drawn permutations (exchanging a minor loss in precision if a permutation is drawn twice‚Äîor more frequently‚Äîfor the efficiency of not having to track which permutations have already been selected). Artificial intelligence for games Monte Carlo methods have been developed into a technique called Monte-Carlo tree search that is useful for searching for the best move in a game. Possible moves are organized in a search tree and many random simulations are used to estimate the long-term potential of each move. A black box simulator represents the opponent's moves. The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method has four steps: #Starting at root node of the tree, select optimal child nodes until a leaf node is reached. #Expand the leaf node and choose one of its children. #Play a simulated game starting with that node. #Use the results of that simulated game to update the node and its ancestors. The net effect, over the course of many simulated games, is that the value of a node representing a move will go up or down, hopefully corresponding to whether or not that node represents a good move. Monte Carlo Tree Search has been used successfully to play games such as Go, Tantrix, Battleship, Havannah, and Arimaa. Design and visuals Monte Carlo methods are also efficient in solving coupled integral differential equations of radiation fields and energy transport, and thus these methods have been used in global illumination computations that produce photo-realistic images of virtual 3D models, with applications in video games, architecture, design, computer generated films, and cinematic special effects. Search and rescue The US Coast Guard utilizes Monte Carlo methods within its computer modeling software SAROPS in order to calculate the probable locations of vessels during search and rescue operations. Each simulation can generate as many as ten thousand data points that are randomly distributed based upon provided variables. Search patterns are then generated based upon extrapolations of these data in order to optimize the probability of containment (POC) and the probability of detection (POD), which together will equal an overall probability of success (POS). Ultimately this serves as a practical application of probability distribution in order to provide the swiftest and most expedient method of rescue, saving both lives and resources. Finance and business Monte Carlo simulation is commonly used to evaluate the risk and uncertainty that would affect the outcome of different decision options. Monte Carlo simulation allows the business risk analyst to incorporate the total effects of uncertainty in variables like sales volume, commodity and labour prices, interest and exchange rates, as well as the effect of distinct risk events like the cancellation of a contract or the change of a tax law. Monte Carlo methods in finance are often used to evaluate investments in projects at a business unit or corporate level, or other financial valuations. They can be used to model project schedules, where simulations aggregate estimates for worst-case, best-case, and most likely durations for each task to determine outcomes for the overall project. Monte Carlo methods are also used in option pricing, default risk analysis. Additionally, they can be used to estimate the financial impact of medical interventions. Law A Monte Carlo approach was used for evaluating the potential value of a proposed program to help female petitioners in Wisconsin be successful in their applications for harassment and domestic abuse restraining orders. It was proposed to help women succeed in their petitions by providing them with greater advocacy thereby potentially reducing the risk of rape and physical assault. However, there were many variables in play that could not be estimated perfectly, including the effectiveness of restraining orders, the success rate of petitioners both with and without advocacy, and many others. The study ran trials that varied these variables to come up with an overall estimate of the success level of the proposed program as a whole. Use in mathematics In general, the Monte Carlo methods are used in mathematics to solve various problems by generating suitable random numbers (see also Random number generation) and observing that fraction of the numbers that obeys some property or properties. The method is useful for obtaining numerical solutions to problems too complicated to solve analytically. The most common application of the Monte Carlo method is Monte Carlo integration.  Integration  Monte-Carlo integration works by comparing random points with the value of the function Errors reduce by a factor of \\\\scriptstyle 1/\\\\sqrt{N} Deterministic numerical integration algorithms work well in a small number of dimensions, but encounter two problems when the functions have many variables. First, the number of function evaluations needed increases rapidly with the number of dimensions. For example, if 10 evaluations provide adequate accuracy in one dimension, then 10100 points are needed for 100 dimensions‚Äîfar too many to be computed. This is called the curse of dimensionality. Second, the boundary of a multidimensional region may be very complicated, so it may not be feasible to reduce the problem to an iterated integral. 100 dimensions is by no means unusual, since in many physical problems, a \\"dimension\\" is equivalent to a degree of freedom. Monte Carlo methods provide a way out of this exponential increase in computation time. As long as the function in question is reasonably well-behaved, it can be estimated by randomly selecting points in 100-dimensional space, and taking some kind of average of the function values at these points. By the central limit theorem, this method displays \\\\scriptstyle 1/\\\\sqrt{N} convergence‚Äîi.e., quadrupling the number of sampled points halves the error, regardless of the number of dimensions. A refinement of this method, known as importance sampling in statistics, involves sampling the points randomly, but more frequently where the integrand is large. To do this precisely one would have to already know the integral, but one can approximate the integral by an integral of a similar function or use adaptive routines such as stratified sampling, recursive stratified sampling, adaptive umbrella sampling or the VEGAS algorithm. A similar approach, the quasi-Monte Carlo method, uses low-discrepancy sequences. These sequences \\"fill\\" the area better and sample the most important points more frequently, so quasi-Monte Carlo methods can often converge on the integral more quickly. Another class of methods for sampling points in a volume is to simulate random walks over it (Markov chain Monte Carlo). Such methods include the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Wang and Landau algorithm, and interacting type MCMC methodologies such as the sequential Monte Carlo samplers.  Simulation and optimization  Another powerful and very popular application for random numbers in numerical simulation is in numerical optimization. The problem is to minimize (or maximize) functions of some vector that often has many dimensions. Many problems can be phrased in this way: for example, a computer chess program could be seen as trying to find the set of, say, 10 moves that produces the best evaluation function at the end. In the traveling salesman problem the goal is to minimize distance traveled. There are also applications to engineering design, such as multidisciplinary design optimization. It has been applied with quasi-one-dimensional models to solve particle dynamics problems by efficiently exploring large configuration space. ReferenceSpall, J. C. (2003), Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control, Wiley, Hoboken, NJ. http://www.jhuapl.edu/ISSO is a comprehensive review of many issues related to simulation and optimization. The traveling salesman problem is what is called a conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices to come up with the one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account. Inverse problems Probabilistic formulation of inverse problems leads to the definition of a probability distribution in the model space. This probability distribution combines prior information with new information obtained by measuring some observable parameters (data). As, in the general case, the theory linking data with model parameters is nonlinear, the posterior probability in the model space may not be easy to describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be defined, etc.). When analyzing an inverse problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model is usually not sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case we may have many model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models in such a way that information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available. The best-known importance sampling method, the Metropolis algorithm, can be generalized, and this gives a method that allows analysis of (possibly highly nonlinear) inverse problems with complex a priori information and data with an arbitrary noise distribution.

A refugee camp for displaced Tutsi in Zaire following the Rwandan genocide of 1994. An ethnic conflict is a conflict between two or more contending ethnic groups. While the source of the conflict may be political, social, economic or religious, the individuals in conflict must expressly fight for their ethnic group's position within society. This final criterion differentiates ethnic conflict from other forms of struggle. Academic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Recently, several political scientists have argued for either top-down or bottom-up explanations for ethnic conflict. Intellectual debate has also focused on whether ethnic conflict has become more prevalent since the end of the Cold War, and on devising ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation. Theories of causes The causes of ethnic conflict are debated by political scientists and sociologists. Explanations generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist, and constructivist. More recent scholarship draws on all three schools. Primordialist accounts Proponents of primordialist accounts argue that \\"[e]thnic groups and nationalities exist because there are traditions of belief and action towards primordial objects such as biological features and especially territorial location\\". Primordialist accounts rely on strong ties of kinship among members of ethnic groups. Donald L. Horowitz argues that this kinship \\"makes it possible for ethnic groups to think in terms of family resemblances\\". Clifford Geertz, a founding scholar of primordialism, asserts that each person has a natural connection to perceived kinsmen. In time and through repeated conflict, essential ties to one's ethnicity will coalesce and will interfere with ties to civil society. Ethnic groups will consequently always threaten the survival of civil governments but not the existence of nations formed by one ethnic group. Thus, when considered through a primordial lens, ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic society is inevitable. A number of political scientists argue that the root causes of ethnic conflict do not involve ethnicity per se but rather institutional, political, and economic factors. These scholars argue that the concept of ethnic war is misleading because it leads to an essentialist conclusion that certain groups are doomed to fight each other when in fact the wars between them that occur are often the result of political decisions. Moreover, primordial accounts do not account for the spatial and temporal variations in ethnic violence. If these \\"ancient hatreds\\" are always simmering under the surface and are at the forefront of people's consciousness, then ethnic groups should constantly be ensnared in violence. However, ethnic violence occurs in sporadic outbursts. For example, Varshney points out that although Yugoslavia broke up due to ethnic violence in the 1990s, it had enjoyed a long peace of decades before the USSR collapsed. Therefore, some scholars claim that it is unlikely that primordial ethnic differences alone caused the outbreak of violence in the 1990s. Primordialists have reformulated the \\"ancient hatreds\\" hypothesis and have focused more on the role of human nature. Petersen argues that the existence of hatred and animosity does not have to be rooted in history for it to play a role in shaping human behavior and action: \\"If \\"ancient hatred\\" means a hatred consuming the daily thoughts of great masses of people, then the \\"ancient hatreds\\" argument deserves to be readily dismissed. However, if hatred is conceived as a historically formed \\"schema\\" that guides action in some situations, then the conception should be taken more seriously.\\" Instrumentalist accounts Anthony Smith notes that the instrumentalist account \\"came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, in the debate about (white) ethnic persistence in what was supposed to have been an effective melting pot\\". This new theory sought explained persistence as the result of the actions of community leaders, \\"who used their cultural groups as sites of mass mobilization and as constituencies in their competition for power and resources, because they found them more effective than social classes\\". In this account of ethnic identification, ethnicity and race are viewed as instrumental means to achieve particular ends. Whether ethnicity is a fixed perception or not is not crucial in the instrumentalist accounts. Moreover, the scholars of this school generally do not oppose the view that ethnic difference plays a part in many conflicts. They simply claim that ethnic difference is not sufficient to explain conflicts. Mass mobilization of ethnic groups can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians would not even attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic or ideological appeals. For these reasons, it is difficult to completely discount the role of inherent ethnic differences. Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could be tempted to mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states. Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted at the expense of other ethnicities. Furthermore, ethnic mass mobilization is likely to be plagued by collective action problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to respond to these shortcomings. For example, Russell Hardin argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not collective action. He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of an ethnic group coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within an ethnic group. Constructivist accounts A third, constructivist, set of accounts stress the importance of the socially constructed nature of ethnic groups, drawing on Benedict Anderson's concept of the imagined community. Proponents of this account point to Rwanda as an example because the Tutsi/Hutu distinction was codified by the Belgian colonial power in the 1930s on the basis of cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records. Identity cards were issued on this basis, and these documents played a key role in the genocide of 1994. Some argue that constructivist narratives of historical master cleavages are unable to account for local and regional variations in ethnic violence. For example, Varshney highlights that in the 1960s \\"racial violence in the USA was heavily concentrated in northern cities; southern cities though intensely politically engaged, did not have riots\\". A constructivist master narrative is often a country level variable whereas we often have to study incidences of ethnic violence at the regional and local level. Scholars of ethnic conflict and civil wars have introduced theories that draw insights from all three traditional schools of thought. In The Geography of Ethnic Violence, Monica Duffy Toft shows how ethnic group settlement patterns, socially constructed identities, charismatic leaders, issue indivisibility, and state concern with precedent setting can lead rational actors to escalate a dispute to violence, even when doing so is likely to leave contending groups much worse off. Such research addresses empirical puzzles that are difficult to explain using primordialist, instrumentalist, or constructivist approaches alone. As Varshney notes, \\"pure essentialists and pure instrumentalists do not exist anymore\\".  Study in the post-Cold War world  conflict in Myanmar The end of the Cold War thus sparked interest in two important questions about ethnic conflict: whether ethnic conflict was on the rise and whether given that some ethnic conflicts had escalated into serious violence, what, if anything, could scholars of large-scale violence (security studies, strategic studies, interstate politics) offer by way of explanation. One of the most debated issues relating to ethnic conflict is whether it has become more or less prevalent in the post‚ÄìCold War period. At the end of the Cold War, academics including Samuel P. Huntington and Robert D. Kaplan predicted a proliferation of conflicts fueled by civilisational clashes, Tribalism, resource scarcity and overpopulation. The post‚ÄìCold War period has witnessed a number of ethnically- informed secessionist movements, predominantly within the former communist states. Conflicts have involved secessionist movements in the former Yugoslavia, Transnistria in Moldova, Armenians in Azerbaijan, Abkhaz and Ossetians in Georgia, Tibetans and East Turkistans in China. Outside the former communist bloc, ethno-separatist strife in the same period has occurred in areas such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, West Papua, Chiapas, East Timor, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Southern Sudan and Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The violent ethnic conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by droughts, food shortages, land degradation, and population growth. However, some theorists contend that this does not represent a rise in the incidence of ethnic conflict, because many of the proxy wars fought during the Cold War as ethnic conflicts were actually hot spots of the Cold War. Research shows that the fall of Communism and the increase in the number of capitalist states were accompanied by a decline in total warfare, interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, and the number of refugees and displaced persons. Indeed, some scholars have questioned whether the concept of ethnic conflict is useful at all. Others have attempted to test the \\"clash of civilisations\\" thesis, finding it to be difficult to operationalise and that civilisational conflicts have not risen in intensity in relation to other ethnic conflicts since the end of the Cold War. A key question facing scholars who attempt to adapt their theories of interstate violence to explain or predict large-scale ethnic violence is whether ethnic groups could be considered \\"rational\\" actors. Prior to the end of the Cold War, the consensus among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and the puzzle of their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained in some other way. As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international- relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.  Public goods provision  A major source of ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic democracies is over the access to state patronage. Conflicts over state resources between ethnic groups can increase the likelihood of ethnic violence. In ethnically divided societies, demand for public goods decreases as each ethnic group derives more utility from benefits targeted at their ethnic group in particular. These benefits would be less valued if all other ethnic groups had access to them. Targeted benefits are more appealing because ethnic groups can solidify or heighten their social and economic status relative to other ethnic groups whereas broad programmatic policies will not improve their relative worth. Politicians and political parties in turn, have an incentive to favor co-ethnics in their distribution of material benefits. Over the long run, ethnic conflict over access to state benefits is likely to lead to the ethnification of political parties and the party system as a whole where the political salience of ethnic identity increase leading to a self- fulfilling equilibrium: If politicians only distribute benefits on an ethnic basis, voters will see themselves primarily belonging to an ethnic group and view politicians the same way. They will only vote for the politician belonging to the same ethnic group. In turn, politicians will refrain from providing public goods because it will not serve them well electorally to provide services to people not belonging to their ethnic group. In democratizing societies, this could lead to ethnic outbidding and lead to extreme politicians pushing out moderate co-ethnics. Patronage politics and ethnic politics eventually reinforce each other, leading to what Chandra terms a \\"patronage democracy\\". The existence of patronage networks between local politicians and ethnic groups make it easier for politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is likely to make them more responsive to calls of violence against other ethnic groups. Therefore, the existence of these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence. While the link between ethnic heterogeneity and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a series of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda, that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no evidence to suggest that co- ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.  Institutional ethnic conflict resolution  A number of scholars have attempted to synthesize the methods available for the resolution, management or transformation of their ethnic conflict. John Coakley, for example, has developed a typology of the methods of conflict resolution that have been employed by states, which he lists as: indigenization, accommodation, assimilation, acculturation, population transfer, boundary alteration, genocide and ethnic suicide. John McGarry and Brendan O'Leary have developed a taxonomy of eight macro-political ethnic conflict regulation methods, which they note are often employed by states in combination with each other.John McGarry and Brendan O‚ÄôLeary (1993) 'Introduction: The macro-political regulation of ethnic conflict‚Äô, in John McGarry and Brendan O‚ÄôLeary (eds.) The Politics of Ethnic Conflict Regulation: Case Studies of Protracted Ethnic Conflicts, London: Routledge, pp. 1-40 They include a number of methods that they note are clearly morally unacceptable. With increasing interest in the field of ethnic conflict, many policy analysts and political scientists theorized potential resolutions and tracked the results of institutional policy implementation. As such, theories often focus on which Institutions are the most appropriate for addressing ethnic conflict.  Consociationalism  Consociationalism is a power sharing agreement which coopts the leaders of ethnic groups into the central state's government. Each nation or ethnic group is represented in the government through a supposed spokesman for the group. In the power sharing agreement, each group has veto powers to varying degrees, dependent on the particular state. Moreover, the norm of proportional representation is dominant: each group is represented in the government in a percentage that reflects the ethnicity's demographic presence in the state. Another requirement for Arend Lijphart is that the government must be composed of a \\"grand coalition\\" of the ethnic group leaders which supposes a top-down approach to conflict resolution. In theory, this leads to self governance and protection for the ethnic group. Many scholars maintain that since ethnic tension erupts into ethnic violence when the ethnic group is threatened by a state, then veto powers should allow the ethnic group to avoid legislative threats. Switzerland is often characterized as a successful consociationalist state. A recent example of a consociational government is the post-conflict Bosnian government that was agreed upon in the Dayton Accords in 1995. A tripartite presidency was chosen and must have a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosniak. The presidents take turns acting as the forefront executive in terms of 8 months for 4 years. Many have credited this compromise of a consociational government in Bosnia for the end of the violence and the following long-lasting peace. In contrast to Lijphart, several political scientists and policy analysts have condemned consociationalism. One of the many critiques is that consociationalism locks in ethnic tensions and identities. This assumes a primordial stance that ethnic identities are permanent and not subject to change. Furthermore, this does not allow for any \\"others\\" that might want to partake in the political process. As of 2012 a Jewish Bosnian is suing the Bosnian government from precluding him from running for presidential office since only a Croat, Serb, or Bosniak can run under the consociational government. Determining ethnic identities in advance and implementing a power sharing system on the basis of these fixed identities is inherently discriminatory against minority groups that might be not be recognized. Moreover, it discriminates against those who do not choose to define their identity on an ethnic or communal basis. In power sharing-systems that are based on pre-determined identities, there is a tendency to rigidly fix shares of representation on a permanent basis which will not reflect changing demographics over time. The categorization of individuals in particular ethnic groups might be controversial anyway and might in fact fuel ethnic tensions. The inherent weaknesses in using pre- determined ethnic identities to form power sharing systems has led Ljiphart to argue that adopting a constructivist approach to consociationalism can increase its likelihood of success. The self-determination of ethnic identities is more likely to be \\"non-discriminatory, neutral, flexible and self-adjusting\\". For example, in South Africa, the toxic legacy of apartheid meant that successful consociation could only be built on the basis of the self-determination of groups. Ljiphart claims that because ethnic identities are often \\"unclear, fluid and flexible,\\" self-determination is likely to be more successful than pre-determination of ethnic groups. A constructivist approach to consociational theory can therefore strengthen its value as a method to resolve ethnic conflict. Another critique points to the privileging of ethnic identity over personal political choice. Howard has deemed consociationalism as a form of ethnocracy and not a path to true pluralistic democracy. Consociationalism assumes that a politician will best represent the will of his co-ethnics above other political parties. This might lead to the polarization of ethnic groups and the loss of non-ethnic ideological parties. Horowitz has argued that a single transferable vote system could prevent the ethnification of political parties because voters cast their ballots in order of preference. This means that a voter could cast some of his votes to parties other than his co-ethnic party. This in turn would compel political parties to broaden their manifestos to appeal to voters across the ethnic divide to hoover up second and third preference votes.  Federalism  The theory of implementing federalism in order to curtail ethnic conflict assumes that self- governance reduces \\"demands for sovereignty\\". Hechter argues that some goods such as language of education and bureaucracy must be provided as local goods, instead of statewide, in order to satisfy more people and ethnic groups. Some political scientists such as Stroschein contend that ethnofederalism, or federalism determined along ethnic lines, is \\"asymmetric\\" as opposed to the equal devolution of power found in non-ethnic federal states, such as the United States. In this sense, special privileges are granted to specific minority groups as concessions and incentives to end violence or mute conflict. The Soviet Union divided its structure into ethnic federal states termed Union Republics. Each Union Republic was named after a titular ethnic group who inhabited the area as a way to Sovietize nationalist sentiments during the 1920s. Brubaker asserts that these titular republics were formed in order to absorb any potential elite led nationalist movements against the Soviet center by incentivizing elite loyalty through advancement in the Soviet political structure. Thus, federalism provides some self-governance for local matters in order to satisfy some of the grievances which might cause ethnic conflict among the masses. Moreover, federalism brings in the elites and ethnic entrepreneurs into the central power structure; this prevents a resurgence of top-down ethnic conflict. Nevertheless, after the fall of the USSR many critiques of federalism as an institution to resolve ethnic conflict emerged. The devolution of power away from the central state can weaken ties to the central state. Moreover, the parallel institutions created to serve a particular nation or ethnic group might provide significant resources for Secession from the central state. As most states are unwilling to give up an integral portion of their territory, secessionist movements may trigger violence. Furthermore, some competing elite political players may not be in power; they would remain unincorporated into the central system. These competing elites can gain access through federal structures and their resources to solidify their political power in the structure. According to V.P. Gagnon this was the case in the former Yugoslavia and its disintegration into its ethnic federal states. Ethnic entrepreneurs were able to take control of the institutionally allocated resources to wage war on other ethnic groups.  Non-territorial autonomy  A recent theory of ethnic tension resolution is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA has emerged in recent years as an alternative solution to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict. For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism. NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of jus solis and jus sanguinis, the principles of territory versus that of personhood. It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets. In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their group rights and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such as in the case of ethnofederalism. The origin of NTA can be traced back to the Marxists works of Otto Bauer and Karl Renner. NTA was employed during the interwar period, and the League of Nations sought to add protection clauses for national minorities in new states. In the 1920s, Estonia granted some cultural autonomy to the German and Jewish populations in order to ease conflicts between the groups and the newly independent state. In Europe, most notably in Belgium, NTA laws have been enacted and created parallel institutions and political parties in the same country. In Belgium, NTA has been integrated within the federal consociational system. Some scholars of ethnic conflict resolution claim that the practice of NTA will be employed dependent on the concentration and size of the ethnic group asking for group rights. Other scholars, such as Clarke, argue that the successful implementation of NTA rests on the acknowledgement in a state of \\"universal\\" principles: true Rule of Law, established human rights, stated guarantees to minorities and their members to use their own quotidien language, religion, and food practices, and a framework of anti-discrimination legislation in order to enforce these rights. Moreover, no individual can be forced to adhere, identify, or emphasize a particular identity (such as race, gender, sexuality, etc.) without their consent in order for NTA to function for its purpose. Nonetheless, Clarke critiques the weaknesses of NTA in areas such as education, a balance between society wide norms and intracommunity values; policing, for criminal matters and public safety; and political representation, which limits the political choices of an individual if based solely on ethnicity. Furthermore, the challenge in evaluating the efficacy of NTA lies in the relatively few legal implementations of NTA. Cultural rights Emphasizing the limits of approaches that focus mainly on institutional answers to ethnic conflicts‚Äîwhich are essentially driven by ethnocultural dynamics of which political and/or economic factors are but elements‚ÄîGregory Paul Meyjes urges the use of intercultural communication and cultural-rights based negotiations as tools with which to effectively and sustainably address inter-ethnic strife. Meyjes argues that to fully grasp, preempt, and/or resolve such conflicts‚Äîwhether with or without the aid of territorial or non-territorial institutional mechanism(s) -- a cultural rights approach grounded in intercultural knowledge and skill is essential.Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul (2012) 'Multi-Ethnic Conflicts in U.S. Military Theatres Overseas: Intercultural Imperatives', in Volker Franke and Robert H. \\"Robin\\" Dorff (eds.)

Ethnic conflict resolution outside formal institutions   Informal inter-ethnic engagement  Institutionalist arguments for resolving ethnic conflict often focus on national-level institutions and do not account for regional and local variation in ethnic violence within a country. Despite similar levels of ethnic diversity in a country, some towns and cities have often found to be especially prone to ethnic violence. For example, Ashutosh Varshney, in his study of ethnic violence in India, argues that strong inter-ethnic engagement in villages often disincentivizes politicians from stoking ethnic violence for electoral gain. Informal interactions include joint participation in festivals, families from different communities eating together or allowing their children to play with one another. Every day engagement between ethnic groups at the village level can help to sustain the peace in the face of national level shocks like an ethnic riot in another part of the country. In times of ethnic tension, these communities can quell rumors, police neighborhoods and come together to resist any attempts by politicians to polarize the community. The stronger the inter-ethnic networks are, the harder it is for politicians to polarize the community even if it may be in their political interest to do so.  Formal inter-ethnic associations  However, in cities, where the population tends to be much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might not be sufficient to prevent violence. This is because many more links are needed to connect everyone, and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes. Interactions between ethnic groups in formal settings can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, making it easier for individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else. Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.

It was designed by and put in place in 1618 or 1619.Naomi Miller, Fountains as Metaphor from Fountains, Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present, edited by Marilyn Symmes, Thames and Hundson and Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. 1998 The current statue is a replica which dates from 1965. The original is kept in the Brussels City Museum. Manneken Pis is the best-known symbol of the people of Brussels. It also embodies their sense of humour (called zwanze in the dialect of Brussels) and their independence of mind. Manneken Pis is located only five minutes' walk from the Grand Place (Brussels' main square), at the junction of / and the pedestrian /. This site is served by the premetro (underground tram) station Bourse/Beurs (on lines 3 and 4) and the bus stops / and Cesar de Paepe. History Origins of Manneken Pis The earliest mention of the existence of Manneken Pis can be found in an administrative text, dating from 1451‚Äì1452, about the water lines supplying the fountains of Brussels. From the beginning, the fountain played an essential role in the distribution of drinking water. It stood on a column and poured water into a double rectangular basin of stone. The only representations of this first statue can be found, very schematically, in a painting by Denis Van Alsloot, representing Brussels' Ommegang of 1615 and in a preparatory drawing to this painting. The first statue was replaced by a new bronze version, commissioned in 1619. This tall bronze statue, on the corner of / and /, was made by Brussels' sculptor Hieronimus Duquesnoy the Elder (1570‚Äì1641), father of J√©r√¥me Duquesnoy the Young and the famous Fran√ßois Duquesnoy. It was probably cast and installed in 1620. During this time, the column supporting the statue and the double rectangular basin collecting water were completely remodeled by Daniel Raessens. Manneken Pis fountain, depicted in an etching by Jacobus Harrewijn (1697) During its history, the statue faced many hazards. It survived undamaged the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army, but the pipes having been affected, it could not deliver its water for some time. A pamphlet published the same year recounts this episode. This text is the oldest attesting that Manneken Pis had become \\"an object of glory appreciated by all and renowned throughout the world\\". It is also the first time that it served as a symbol for the people of Brussels. It is also traditionally said that after the bombardment, it was triumphantly placed again on its pedestal. On that occasion, the following passage from the Bible was inscribed above its head : (\\"The Lord placed me on a stone base, and now I raise my head above my enemies\\"). As shown by an engraving by Jacques Harrewijn, dating from 1697, the fountain was no longer located on the street, but in a recess at the corner of / and /. Manneken Pis in its niche, fitted in 1770 In 1770, the column and the double rectangular basin disappeared; the statue was integrated into a new decor, in the form of a stone niche in rockery style, originating from another dismantled fountain of Brussels. The water simply flowed through a grating in the ground, which was replaced by a basin in the 19th century. In its new setting, Manneken Pis gives the impression of being smaller than in its original layout. The whole structure is protected by railings, the last version of which dates from 1851. The latter prevented access to water, relegating the fountain to a decorative and symbolic role. It is also the case, around the same time, of the other fountains in Brussels. This correlates with efforts by the City of Brussels, starting in 1855, to allow for the distribution of drinking water in homes. The figure has repeatedly been the object of theft or attempted theft. Legend has it that the statue was removed in 1745 and found in the Flemish town of Geraardsbergen (). As a sign of their appreciation, the people of Brussels gave this city a replica of the statue. In reality, the first attempted theft was made in 1747 by a group of French grenadiers stationed in Brussels. The population rebelled against this deed and threatened a bloody revenge. To calm things down, the King of France, Louis XV, offered a gentleman's gown of brocade, embroidered with gold, to Manneken Pis. He also authorised him to carry the sword, and decorated him with the Cross of St. Louis. The statue was stolen in 1817 by the fugitive Antoine Licas. The perpetrator was heavily punished; he was condemned to forced labour for life, and was first tied for an hour to stocks on the Grand Place. The original statue was broken into 11 pieces during this abduction and was restored by a specialised welder, under the supervision of sculptor Gilles-Lambert Godecharle. The pieces were matched and used to make a mold in which the bronze statue was poured. The statue was then screwed onto a new base marked \\"1620 ‚Äì REST 1817\\". 20th century‚Äìpresent Manneken Pis experienced similar misadventures in the 20th century. Two attempted thefts occurred in 1955 and 1957. Some accounts say that it has been stolen up to seven times; in January 1963 by students of the Antwerp student association \\"De Wikings\\" of the Sint-Ignatius Handelshogeschool (Higher Business Education), now part of the Antwerp University, who \\"hijacked\\" the statue for five days before handing it over to the Antwerp authorities. The local and international press covered the story, contributing to the students' collection of funds donated to two orphanages. Things were more serious when it disappeared in 1965; the statue had been broken by the thief and only the feet and ankles remained. In June 1966, the Antwerp magazine De Post received an anonymous phone call, signaling that the body was in the Charleroi Canal. It was found there by divers, sent by the magazine, and was brought back to Brussels on 27 June. Restored once again, the statue was sheltered and the original version is now kept and displayed on the second floor of the Brussels City Museum, at the Maison du Roi/Broodhuis, on the Grand Place. The statue now on display on the corner of / and / is an identical copy. In late 2018, it was discovered by city technician R√©gis Callens that the basin of the statue had developed a leak, leading to a reported 1,000‚Äì1,500 liters (around 300 gallons) of water being used per day. The leak occurred for an unknown number of years, unnoticed among the several hundred water features in the City of Brussels and was only later discovered with the help of Shayp water monitoring technology. The statue received a temporary fix in March 2019, with a permanent recirculating system set to be installed. The solution was announced during Brussels Water Week where city officials cited the situation as motivation to check for similar problems in other fountains. Legends The surroundings of Manneken Pis give an idea of its size. There are several legends behind Manneken Pis, but the most famous is the one about Duke Godfrey III of Leuven. In 1142, the troops of this two-year-old lord were battling against the troops of the Berthouts, the lords of Grimbergen, in Ransbeke (now Neder-Over-Heembeek). The troops put the infant lord in a basket and hung the basket in a tree to encourage them. From there, the boy urinated on the troops of the Berthouts, who eventually lost the battle. * Another legend states that, in the 14th century, Brussels was under siege by a foreign power. The city had held its ground for some time, so the attackers conceived of a plan to place explosive charges at the city walls. A little boy named happened to be spying on them, as they were preparing. He urinated on the burning fuse and thus saved the city. There was, at the time (middle of the 15th century, perhaps as early as 1388), a similar statue made of stone. The statue was stolen several times. * Another story, often told to tourists, tells of a wealthy merchant who, during a visit to the city with his family, had his beloved young son go missing. The merchant hastily formed a search party, which scoured all corners of the city, until the boy was found happily urinating in a small garden. The merchant, as a gift of gratitude to the locals who helped out during the search, had the fountain built. * Another legend tells that a small boy went missing from his mother, when shopping in the centre of the city. The woman, panic-stricken by the loss of her child, called upon everyone she came across, including the mayor of the city. A citywide search began, and when at last the child was found, he was urinating on the corner of a small street. The story was passed down over time and the statue was erected as a tribute to the well-known legend. * Another legend tells of the young boy who was awoken by a fire and was able to put out the fire with his urine. In the end, this helped stop the king's castle from burning down. Manneken Pis is sometimes given the nickname of in French or in Dutch (both meaning \\"Little Julien\\"), which in fact refers to a now- disappeared fountain of Julian (Juliaenkensborre), by mistakenly confusing two well-distinct fountains. Traditions Costumes and folklore Erasmus School of Brussels Manneken Pis is dressed in costumes, several times each week, according to a published schedule, which is posted on the railings around the fountain. Since 1954, the costumes are managed by the non-profit association The Friends of Manneken-Pis, who review hundreds of designs submitted each year, and select a small number to be produced and used. His wardrobe consists of around one thousand different costumes, many of which may be viewed in a permanent exhibition inside the City Museum, located on the Grand Place, immediately opposite the Town Hall. In February 2017, a specially designed museum, at 19, /, called Garderobe MannekenPis, opened its doors. Although the proliferation of costumes is of twentieth-century origin, the occasional use of costumes dates back almost to the date of casting; the oldest costume on display, in the City Museum, being of seventeenth-century origin. In 1756, an inventory indicates that Manneken Pis had five complete costumes. From 1918 to 1940, he was offered some thirty costumes. But it was especially after 1945 that the movement took on an exceptional dimension; he had more than 400 costumes in 1994, more than 750 in 2005, and more than 950 in 2016. The costume change, on the figure, is a colourful ceremony, often accompanied by brass band music. Many costumes represent the national dress of nations whose citizens come to Brussels as tourists; others are the uniforms of assorted trades, professions, associations, and branches of the civil and military services. On certain occasions (Saint-Verhaegen, Meyboom plantation, for example), the statue is hooked up to a keg of beer. Cups are filled up with the beer flowing from the statue and given out to passers-by.

Although Brussels' Manneken Pis is the best known, others exist. There is an ongoing dispute over which Manneken Pis is the oldest ‚Äì the one in Brussels or the one in Geraardsbergen. Similar statues can also be found in the Belgian cities of Koksijde, Hasselt, Ghent, Bruges, in the town of Braine-l'Alleud (where it is called \\"Il Gamin Quipiche\\"), and in the French Flemish village of Broxeele, a town with the same etymology as Brussels. Internationally A Japanese variant of Manneken Pis on the station platform in Tokyo Since the 20th century, numerous copies or imitations of Manneken Pis have been created both in Belgium and abroad. It is necessary to distinguish the official copies offered by the City of Brussels from copies and imitations carried out privately by admirers of the little statue. Official copies were offered to: * Colmar, France (1921) * Osaka, Japan (1928) * Monaco (1951) * London, United Kingdom (1959) * Broxeele, France (1979) * Benalmadena, Spain (1991) * Nagoya, Japan (2015) In many countries, replicas in brass or fiberglass are common swimming or garden- pool decorations. Many copies exist worldwide as garden ornaments. Manneken Pis has also been adapted into such risqu√© souvenir items as ashtrays and corkscrews. A copy of the statue stands in the Danish town of Bogense. In September 2002, a Belgian-born waffle-maker set up a replica in front of his waffle stand in the Orlando Fashion Square mall, in Orlando, Florida. He recalled the legend as \\"the boy who saved Brussels from fire by extinguishing it with his urine\\" (confusing the legend with an incident in Gulliver's Travels perhaps). Some shocked shoppers made a formal complaint. Mall officials said that the waffle-shop owner did not follow procedures when he put up the statue and was therefore in violation of his lease. In contrast, there is a similar statue in Rio de Janeiro, in front of the quarters of Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, a famous Brazilian football club. There, the presence of the statue is taken lightly, and it has even been adopted as a mascot by the club. Fans usually dress it with the club's jersey, after important wins. A working replica of Manneken Pis stands on the platform of Hamamatsuch≈ç Station in Tokyo, Japan. The statue is a great source of pride for station workers who dress it in various costumes‚Äîtraditional and otherwise‚Äîat different times of year. Statues inspired by Manneken Pis Since 1987, Manneken Pis has had a female equivalent, Jeanneke Pis, located on the east side of a small alley called /, near /, representing a little girl squatting in the act of urinating. It feeds a small fountain. It is, however, less illustrious than its masculine counterpart. Het Zinneke, depicting a dog urinating against a marker, can be seen as a reference to Manneken Pis. It is, however, not associated with a fountain. Zinneke means bastard in the dialect of Brussels. File:Bruksela, Jeanneke Pis - SiusiajƒÖca dziewczynka.jpgJeanneke Pis statue in Brussels File:203-365 Zinneke Pis, Bruxelles.jpgHet Zinneke statue in Brussels In popular culture Books *Manneken Pis is granted a humorous tribute in the comic album Asterix in Belgium. For Asterix- related events taking place in Brussels, the sculpture has also been clad in Asterix's trademark garments.Manneken-Pis as Asterix (Asterix in Belgium) (May 31, 2017) Films *The 1968 film The Party, starring Peter Sellers, includes a reproduction of the statue in the house's extended water feature. The statue's peeing can be changed at an extended intercom panel, and Sellers, as Hrundi V. Bakshi, soaks a guest when he hits the wrong button. *In the 1986 film The Money Pit, the lead character, Walter Fielding, played by Tom Hanks, accidentally falls in a construction area where workers are renovating his home. In a sequence reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine, he stumbles through a window, across the roof, down a scaffold, finally into a wheeled bin in which he rolls down a hill and is dumped into a fountain resting directly under a replica of Manneken Pis. *Manneken Pis is a 1995 Belgian comedy-drama film, directed by Frank Van Passel and written by Christophe Dirickx. It premiered in May 1995 at the Cannes Film Festival. It received the Andr√© Cavens Award for Best Film and four awards at the Joseph Plateau Awards. The film was selected as the Belgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

She was awarded the Cholmondeley Award for Poets and won the Queen's Gold Medal for poetry. A play Stevie by Hugh Whitemore, based on her life, was adapted into a film starring Glenda Jackson. Life Stevie Smith, born Florence Margaret Smith in Kingston upon Hull, was the second daughter of Ethel and Charles Smith.(Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, p. 32. She was called \\"Peggy\\" within her family, but acquired the name \\"Stevie\\" as a young woman when she was riding in the park with a friend who said that she reminded him of the jockey Steve Donoghue. Her father was a shipping agent, a business that he had inherited from his father. As the company and his marriage began to fall apart, he ran away to sea and Smith saw very little of him after that.Smith, Florence Margaret (Stevie) (1902‚Äì1971), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Retrieved 22 March 2011 He appeared occasionally on 24-hour shore leave and sent very brief postcards (\\"Off to Valparaiso, Love Daddy\\"). When Stevie Smith was three years old, she moved with her mother and sister to Palmers Green in North London where she would live until her death in 1971. She resented the fact that her father had abandoned his family. Later, when her mother became ill, her aunt Madge Spear (whom Smith called \\"The Lion Aunt\\") came to live with them, raised Smith and her elder sister Molly and became the most important person in Smith's life. Spear was a feminist who claimed to have \\"no patience\\" with men and, as Smith wrote, \\"she also had 'no patience' with Hitler\\". Smith and Molly, raised in a family of women, became attached to their own independence, in contrast to what Smith described as the typical Victorian family atmosphere of \\"father knows best\\". When Smith was five, she developed tuberculous peritonitis and was sent to a sanatorium near Broadstairs, Kent, where she remained for three years.(Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, p. 33. She related that her preoccupation with death began when she was seven, at a time when she was very distressed at being sent away from her mother. Death and fear fascinated her and provide the subjects of many of her poems.(Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, p. 35. Her mother died when Smith was 16. When suffering from the depression to which she was subject all her life, Smith was so consoled by the thought of death as a release that, as she put it, she did not have to commit suicide. She wrote in several poems that death was \\"the only god who must come when he is called\\". Smith suffered throughout her life from an acute nervousness, described as a mix of shyness and intense sensitivity. In the poem \\"A House of Mercy\\", she wrote of her childhood house in North London: > It was a house of female habitation, Two ladies fair inhabited the house, > And they were brave. For although Fear knocked loud Upon the door, and said > he must come in, They did not let him in. Smith was educated at Palmers Green High School and North London Collegiate School for Girls. She spent the remainder of her life with her aunt, and worked as private secretary to Sir Neville Pearson with Sir George Newnes at Newnes Publishing Company in London from 1923 to 1953. Despite her secluded life, she corresponded and socialised widely with other writers and creative artists, including Elisabeth Lutyens, Sally Chilver, Inez Holden, Naomi Mitchison, Isobel English and Anna Kallin. After she retired from Sir Neville Pearson's service following a nervous breakdown she gave poetry readings and broadcasts on the BBC that gained her new friends and readers among a younger generation. Sylvia Plath became a fan of her poetry and sent Smith a letter in 1962, describing herself as \\"a desperate Smith-addict.\\" Plath expressed interest in meeting in person but committed suicide soon after sending the letter.(Barbera, Jack & McBrien, William, editors 1982) Me Again, Uncollected Writings of Stevie Smith, Virago Press Limited, p. 6. Smith was described by her friends as being naive and selfish in some ways and formidably intelligent in others, having been raised by her aunt as both a spoiled child and a resolutely autonomous woman. Likewise, her political views vacillated between her aunt's Toryism and her friends' left-wing tendencies. Smith was celibate for most of her life, although she rejected the idea that she was lonely as a result, alleging that she had a number of intimate relationships with friends and family that kept her fulfilled. She never entirely abandoned or accepted the Anglican faith of her childhood, describing herself as a \\"lapsed atheist\\", and wrote sensitively about theological puzzles;(Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, p. 39.\\"There is a God in whom I do not believe/Yet to this God my love stretches.\\" Her 14-page essay of 1958, \\"The Necessity of Not Believing\\", concludes: \\"There is no reason to be sad, as some people are sad when they feel religion slipping off from them. There is no reason to be sad, it is a good thing.\\" The essay was unveiled at a meeting of the Cambridge Humanist Society, affiliated to the British Humanist Association (now known as Humanists UK), which represented humanists. Smith died of a brain tumour on 7 March 1971. Her last collection, Scorpion and other Poems was published posthumously in 1972, and the Collected Poems followed in 1975. Three novels were republished and there was a successful play based on her life, Stevie, written by Hugh Whitemore. It was filmed in 1978 by Robert Enders and starred Glenda Jackson and Mona Washbourne.ODNB entry. Fiction Smith wrote three novels, the first of which, Novel on Yellow Paper, was published in 1936. Apart from death, common subjects in her writing include loneliness; myth and legend; absurd vignettes, usually drawn from middle-class British life; war; human cruelty; and religion. All her novels are lightly fictionalised accounts of her own life, which got her into trouble at times as people recognised themselves. Smith said that two of the male characters in her last book are different aspects of George Orwell, who was close to Smith. There were rumours that they were lovers; he was married to his first wife at the time.  Novel on Yellow Paper (Cape, 1936)  Smith's first novel is structured as the random typings of a bored secretary, Pompey. She plays word games, retells stories from classical and popular culture, remembers events from her childhood, gossips about her friends and describes her family, particularly her beloved Aunt. As with all Smith's novels, there is an early scene where the heroine expresses feelings and beliefs which she will later feel significant, although ambiguous, regret for. In Novel on Yellow Paper that belief is anti-Semitism, where she feels elation at being the \\"only Goy\\" at a Jewish party. This apparently throwaway scene acts as a timebomb, which detonates at the centre of the novel when Pompey visits Germany as the Nazis are gaining power. With horror, she acknowledges the continuity between her feeling \\"Hurray for being a Goy\\" at the party and the madness that is overtaking Germany. The German scenes stand out in the novel, but perhaps equally powerful is her dissection of failed love. She describes two unsuccessful relationships, first with the German Karl and then with the suburban Freddy. The final section of the novel describes with unusual clarity the intense pain of her break-up with Freddy. Over the Frontier (Cape, 1938) Smith herself dismissed her second novel as a failed experiment, but its attempt to parody popular genre fiction to explore profound political issues now seems to anticipate post-modern fiction. If anti-Semitism was one of the key themes of Novel on Yellow Paper, Over the Frontier is concerned with militarism. In particular, she asks how the necessity of fighting Fascism can be achieved without descending into the nationalism and dehumanisation that fascism represents. After a failed romance the heroine, Pompey, suffers a breakdown and is sent to Germany to recuperate. At this point the novel changes style radically, as Pompey becomes part of an adventure/spy yarn in the style of John Buchan or Dornford Yates. As the novel becomes increasingly dreamlike, Pompey crosses over the frontier to become a spy and soldier. If her initial motives are idealistic, she becomes seduced by the intrigue and, ultimately, violence. The vision Smith offers is a bleak one: \\"Power and cruelty are the strengths of our lives, and only in their weakness is there love.\\" The Holiday (Chapman and Hall, 1949) Smith's final novel was her own favourite, and is her most fully realised. It is concerned with personal and political malaise in the immediate post-war period. Most of the characters are employed in the army or the civil service in post-war reconstruction, and its heroine, Celia, works for the Ministry as a cryptographer and propagandist. The Holiday describes a series of hopeless relationships. Celia and her cousin Caz are in love, but cannot pursue their affair since it is believed that, because of their parents' adultery, they are half-brother and half-sister. Celia's other cousin Tom is in love with her, Basil is love with Tom, Tom is estranged from his father, Celia's beloved Uncle Heber, who pines for a reconciliation; and Celia's best friend Tiny longs for the married Vera. These unhappy, futureless but intractable relationships are mirrored by the novel's political concerns. The unsustainability of the British Empire and the uncertainty over Britain's post-war role are constant themes, and many of the characters discuss their personal and political concerns as if they were seamlessly linked. Caz is on leave from Palestine and is deeply disillusioned, Tom goes mad during the war, and it is telling that the family scandal that blights Celia and Caz's lives took place in India. Just as Pompey's anti- Semitism is tested in Novel on Yellow Paper, so Celia's traditional nationalism and sentimental support for colonialism are challenged throughout The Holiday. Poetry Smith's first volume of poetry, the self-illustrated A Good Time Was Had By All, was published in 1937 and established her as a poet. Soon her poems were found in periodicals. Her style was often very dark; her characters were perpetually saying \\"goodbye\\" to their friends or welcoming death. At the same time her work has an eerie levity and can be very funny though it is neither light nor whimsical. \\"Stevie Smith often uses the word 'peculiar' and it is the best word to describe her effects\\" (Hermione Lee). She was never sentimental, undercutting any pathetic effects with the ruthless honesty of her humour. \\"A good time was had by all\\" itself became a catch phrase, still occasionally used to this day. Smith said she got the phrase from parish magazines, where descriptions of church picnics often included this phrase.A Dictionary of Catch Phrases, by Eric Partridge This saying has become so familiar that it is recognised even by those who are unaware of its origin. Variations appear in pop culture, including \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" by the Beatles. Though her poems were remarkably consistent in tone and quality throughout her life, their subject matter changed over time, with less of the outrageous wit of her youth and more reflection on suffering, faith and the end of life. Her best-known poem is \\"Not Waving but Drowning\\". She was awarded the Cholmondeley Award for Poets in 1966 and won the Queen's Gold Medal for poetry in 1969.(Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, p. 39. She published nine volumes of poems in her lifetime (three more were released posthumously).Stevie Smith 1902-1971, Biography, Poetry Foundation As an occasional work, Smith wrote the text of the coffee-table book Cats in Colour (1959), for which she wrote a humorous series of captions to photographs imagining the inner lives of cats. Smith's poems have been the focus of writers and critics around the world. James Antoniou writes in The Australian that her 'apparent innocence masks such fierce complexities, such ambition and startling originality, that many people baulk at her work', while Michael Dirda affirms in the Washington Post that, 'certainly, an outward charm is part of Smith‚Äôs aesthetic strategy, though there‚Äôs nothing naive or whimsical beneath her surface.' Carol Rumens writes in The Guardian that Smith 'skewered formality, though formally deft, and challenged, with a Victorian school marm‚Äôs brisk tartness, the lingering shades of late-Victorian social hypocrisy.'

Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a forest fire, brush fire, bushfire (in Australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire, while wildland-fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use (WFU; these are also called monitored response fires). Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. The occurrence of wildfires throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna. Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions. Wildfires can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition, their physical properties, the combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire. Wildfires can cause damage to property and human life, although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation, animals, and ecosystems that have evolved with fire. Wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels, physical setting, and weather.Graham, et al., 12, 36National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management, 4‚Äì6. Analyses of historical meteorological data and national fire records in western North America show the primacy of climate in driving large regional fires via wet periods that create substantial fuels, or drought and warming that extend conducive fire weather. High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called \\"snag forest habitat\\"), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest. Many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction. Wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects. Wildfires are among the most common forms of natural disaster in some regions, including Siberia, California, and Australia.https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3918https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart- news/siberian-wildfires-cause-record-pollution-send-smoke- us-180975275/https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/community-safety/bushfire Areas with Mediterranean climates or in the taiga biome are particularly susceptible. Causes  Natural  Leading natural causes of wildfires include: * dry climate * lightning * volcanic eruption  Human activity  The most common direct human causes of wildfire ignition include arson, discarded cigarettes, power-lines arcs (as detected by arc mapping), and sparks from equipment. Ignition of wildland fires via contact with hot rifle- bullet fragments is also possible under the right conditions. Wildfires can also be started in communities experiencing shifting cultivation, where land is cleared quickly and farmed until the soil loses fertility, and slash and burn clearing. Forested areas cleared by logging encourage the dominance of flammable grasses, and abandoned logging roads overgrown by vegetation may act as fire corridors. Annual grassland fires in southern Vietnam stem in part from the destruction of forested areas by US military herbicides, explosives, and mechanical land-clearing and -burning operations during the Vietnam War.Karki, 4.  Prevalence  The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and land-conversion burning. In China and in the Mediterranean Basin, human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires. In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or arson). Coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world, such as those in Burning Mountain, New South Wales; Centralia, Pennsylvania; and several coal-sustained fires in China. They can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material. Person-caused wildfires account for 40% of wildfires in British Columbia, and are caused by activities such as open burning, the use of engines or vehicles, dropping burning substances such as cigarettes, or any other human-related activities that can create a spark or a heat source sufficient to ignite a wildfire. Hundreds of fires were burning in 2019 in British Columbia and a quarter of them were caused by humans. Spread A surface fire in the western desert of Utah, United States North Cascades, United States Forest fires visible from a distance in Dajti National Park, Tirana, Albania The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.Graham, et al., iv. Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by topography, as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: * Ground fires are fed by subterranean roots, duff and other buried organic matter. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as peat fires in Kalimantan and Eastern Sumatra, Indonesia, which resulted from a riceland creation project that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.Graham, et al., 9, 13 * Crawling or surface fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation on the forest floor such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.Graham, et al ., iv, 10, 14 This kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires (less than ) and may spread at slow rate, though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread. * Ladder fires consume material between low-level vegetation and tree canopies, such as small trees, downed logs, and vines. Kudzu, Old World climbing fern, and other invasive plants that scale trees may also encourage ladder fires. * Crown, canopy, or aerial fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a crown fire, termed crowning, is dependent on the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze.Graham, et al., iv, 8, 11, 15. Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the Amazon rain forest, damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions. In monsoonal areas of north Australia, surface fires can spread, including across intended firebreaks, by burning or smoldering pieces of wood or burning tufts of grass carried intentionally by large flying birds accustomed to catch prey flushed out by wildfires. Species implicated are Black Kite (Milvus migrans), Whistling Kite (Haliastur sphenurus), and Brown Falcon (Falco berigora). Local Aborigines have known of this behavior for a long time, including in their mythology. Physical properties Experimental fire in alt=A line of trees completely engulfed in flames. Towers with instrumentation are seen just beyond the fire's reach. A dirt road acted as a fire barrier in South Africa. The effects of the barrier can clearly be seen on the unburnt (left) and burnt (right) sides of the road. Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triforce come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.Graham, et al., 12. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management, 3. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts. A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material.Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology, 74. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of . Next, the pyrolysis of wood at releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at .de Sousa Costa and Sandberg, 229‚Äì230. Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to , which pre- heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below.Graham, et al., 10‚Äì11. Wildfires have a rapid forward rate of spread (FROS) when burning through dense uninterrupted fuels. They can move as fast as in forests and in grasslands.Billing, 5‚Äì6 Wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front, or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by backing.Graham, et al., 12 They may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands (hot wood embers) and other burning materials through the air over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks.Graham, et al., 16. Torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels around a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands.Graham, et al., 9, 16. Spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire. In Australian bushfires, spot fires are known to occur as far as from the fire front. The incidence of large, uncontained wildfires in North America has increased in recent years, significantly impacting both urban and agriculturally-focused areas. The physical damage and health pressures left in the wake of uncontrolled fires has especially devastated farm and ranch operators in affected areas, prompting concern from the community of healthcare providers and advocates servicing this specialized occupational population. Especially large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect: air rises as it is heated, and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new, cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal columns.National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management, 4. Great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds, strong winds, and fire whirls with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than .Graham, et al., 16‚Äì17.Olson, et al., 2 Rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of fire whirls, and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions.Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology, 69. The thermal heat from a wildfire can cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders, heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur, which may cause an object's structure to fail. Effect of climate Lightning- sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences during the dry summer season in Nevada. A wildfire in Venezuela during a drought Heat waves, droughts, climate variability such as El Ni√±o, and regional weather patterns such as high- pressure ridges can increase the risk and alter the behavior of wildfires dramatically. McKenzie, et al., 893 Years of precipitation followed by warm periods can encourage more widespread fires and longer fire seasons.Graham, et al., 2 Since the mid-1980s, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season, or the most fire-prone time of the year, in the Western United States. Global warming may increase the intensity and frequency of droughts in many areas, creating more intense and frequent wildfires. A 2015 study indicates that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human- induced climate change. A study of alluvial sediment deposits going back over 8,000 years found warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and stand-replacing fires and concluded climate was such a powerful influence on wildfire that trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future. Intensity also increases during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.de Souza Costa and Sandberg, 228 Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill. At night the land cools, creating air currents that travel downhill. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys.National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management, 5. Fires in Europe occur frequently during the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.San- Miguel-Ayanz, et al., 364. Wildfire suppression operations in the United States revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology, 73. In 2019 extreme heat and dryness caused massive wildfires in Siberia, Alaska, Canary Islands, Australia, and in the Amazon rainforest. The fires in the latter were caused mainly by illegal logging. The smoke from the fires expanded on huge territory including major cities, dramatically reducing air quality. As of August 2020, the wildfires in the year were 13% worse than in 2019. Climate change, and Deforestation are the main cause. The CO2 emissions were equal to those of the European Union. The fires are threatening the existence of the Amazon rainforest. According to Mike Barrett, Executive Director of Science and Conservation at WWF-UK, if this rainforest is destroyed \\"we lose the fight against climate change. There will be no going back.‚Äù  Emissions  Wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, black carbon, brown carbon, and ozone precursors into the atmosphere. These emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales. Wildfires also emit substantial amounts of volatile and semi-volatile organic materials and nitrogen oxides that form ozone and organic particulate matter. Direct emissions of toxic pollutants can affect first responders and local residents. In addition, the formation of the other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires. Ecology Global fires during the year 2008 for the months of August (top image) and February (bottom image), as detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite. Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna. Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods. Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and Southeast Asia, the veld in southern Africa, the fynbos in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the Mediterranean Basin. High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called ‚Äúsnag forest habitat‚Äù), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest. Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife. Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests. Post-fire logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts; the same is often true for post-fire seeding. Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the chaparral in southern California and lower-elevation deserts in the American Southwest. The increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent areas has upset natural cycles, damaged native plant communities, and encouraged the growth of non-native weeds.Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy, 3, 37.Graham, et al., 3. Invasive species, such as Lygodium microphyllum and Bromus tectorum, can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires. Because they are highly flammable, they can increase the future risk of fire, creating a positive feedback loop that increases fire frequency and further alters native vegetation communities.van Wagtendonk (2007), 14. In the Amazon Rainforest, drought, logging, cattle ranching practices, and slash-and-burn agriculture damage fire-resistant forests and promote the growth of flammable brush, creating a cycle that encourages more burning.Nepstad, 4, 8‚Äì11 Fires in the rainforest threaten its collection of diverse species and produce large amounts of CO2. Also, fires in the rainforest, along with drought and human involvement, could damage or destroy more than half of the Amazon rainforest by the year 2030.Nepstad, 4 Wildfires generate ash, reduce the availability of organic nutrients, and cause an increase in water runoff, eroding away other nutrients and creating flash flood conditions. A 2003 wildfire in the North Yorkshire Moors burned off of heather and the underlying peat layers. Afterwards, wind erosion stripped the ash and the exposed soil, revealing archaeological remains dating back to 10,000 BC. Wildfires can also have an effect on climate change, increasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and inhibiting vegetation growth, which affects overall carbon uptake by plants. In tundra there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain. Research in Alaska has shown fire-event return intervals, (FRIs) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter upland areas. Plant adaptation Ecological succession after a wildfire in a boreal pine forest next to Hara Bog, Lahemaa National Park, Estonia. The pictures were taken one and two years after the fire. Plants in wildfire-prone ecosystems often survive through adaptations to their local fire regime. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition. For example, plants of the genus Eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire- tolerant species.Fire. The Australian Experience, 5. Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures. Fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as embodied by pioneer species. Smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called serotiny. Exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing the production of the orange butenolide. Grasslands in Western Sabah, Malaysian pine forests, and Indonesian Casuarina forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire.Karki, 3. Chamise deadwood litter is low in water content and flammable, and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire. Cape lilies lie dormant until flames brush away the covering and then blossom almost overnight. Sequoia rely on periodic fires to reduce competition, release seeds from their cones, and clear the soil and canopy for new growth. Caribbean Pine in Bahamian pineyards have adapted to and rely on low-intensity, surface fires for survival and growth. An optimum fire frequency for growth is every 3 to 10 years. Too frequent fires favor herbaceous plants, and infrequent fires favor species typical of Bahamian dry forests. Atmospheric effects A thumb Most of the Earth's weather and air pollution resides in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere that extends from the surface of the planet to a height of about . The vertical lift of a severe thunderstorm or pyrocumulonimbus can be enhanced in the area of a large wildfire, which can propel smoke, soot, and other particulate matter as high as the lower stratosphere. Previously, prevailing scientific theory held that most particles in the stratosphere came from volcanoes, but smoke and other wildfire emissions have been detected from the lower stratosphere. Pyrocumulus clouds can reach over wildfires.Graham, et al., 17 Satellite observation of smoke plumes from wildfires revealed that the plumes could be traced intact for distances exceeding . Computer-aided models such as CALPUFF may help predict the size and direction of wildfire-generated smoke plumes by using atmospheric dispersion modeling. Wildfires can affect local atmospheric pollution, and release carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Wildfire emissions contain fine particulate matter which can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Increased fire byproducts in the troposphere can increase ozone concentration beyond safe levels. Forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes (0.89 and 2.83 billion short tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere, which is between 13%‚Äì40% of the annual global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. In June and July of 2019, fires in the Arctic emitted more than 140 megatons of carbon dioxide, according to an analysis by CAMS. To put that into perspective this amounts to the same amount of carbon emitted by 36 million cars in a year. The recent wildfires and their massive CO2 emissions mean that it will be important to take them into consideration when implementing measures for reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets accorded with the Paris climate agreement.The Effects of Wildfires on a Zero Carbon Future Atmospheric models suggest that these concentrations of sooty particles could increase absorption of incoming solar radiation during winter months by as much as 15%. The Amazon is estimated to hold around 90 billion tons of carbon. As of 2019, earth's atmosphere has 415 parts per million of carbon, and the destruction of the Amazon would add about 38 parts per million.

History Elk Bath, an award winning photograph of elk avoiding a wildfire in Montana The first evidence of wildfires is rhyniophytoid plant fossils preserved as charcoal, discovered in the Welsh Borders, dating to the Silurian period (about ). Smoldering surface fires started to occur sometime before the Early Devonian period . Low atmospheric oxygen during the Middle and Late Devonian was accompanied by a decrease in charcoal abundance. Additional charcoal evidence suggests that fires continued through the Carboniferous period. Later, the overall increase of atmospheric oxygen from 13% in the Late Devonian to 30‚Äì31% by the Late Permian was accompanied by a more widespread distribution of wildfires. Later, a decrease in wildfire-related charcoal deposits from the late Permian to the Triassic periods is explained by a decrease in oxygen levels.Pausas and Keeley, 594 Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous progymnosperm forests. Lepidodendron forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires. In Jurassic gymnosperm forests, there is evidence of high frequency, light surface fires. The increase of fire activity in the late TertiaryHistorically, the Cenozoic has been divided up into the Quaternary and Tertiary sub-eras, as well as the Neogene and Paleogene periods. The 2009 version of the ICS time chart recognizes a slightly extended Quaternary as well as the Paleogene and a truncated Neogene, the Tertiary having been demoted to informal status. is possibly due to the increase of C4-type grasses. As these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands.Pausas and Keeley, 595 However, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus and Sequoia, which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ pyriscence.Pausas and Keeley, 596 \\"Redwood Trees\\" . Human involvement Aerial view of deliberate wildfires on the Khun Tan Range, Thailand. These fires are lit by local farmers every year in order to promote the growth of a certain mushroom The human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes. Woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel, hunting, seed-gathering and planting.Pausas and Keeley, 597 In recorded human history, minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the Bible and by classical writers such as Homer. However, while ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Roman writers were aware of fires, they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred.Rackham, 229‚Äì230 Wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as early thermal weapons. From the Middle ages, accounts were written of occupational burning as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire. In Germany, regular burning was documented in 1290 in the Odenwald and in 1344 in the Black Forest. In the 14th century Sardinia, firebreaks were used for wildfire protection. In Spain during the 1550s, sheep husbandry was discouraged in certain provinces by Philip II due to the harmful effects of fires used in transhumance. As early as the 17th century, Native Americans were observed using fire for many purposes including cultivation, signaling, and warfare. Scottish botanist David Douglas noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers. Charcoal found in sedimentary deposits off the Pacific coast of Central America suggests that more burning occurred in the 50 years before the Spanish colonization of the Americas than after the colonization.* In the post-World War II Baltic region, socio-economic changes led more stringent air quality standards and bans on fires that eliminated traditional burning practices. In the mid-19th century, explorers from observed Australian Aborigines using fire for ground clearing, hunting, and regeneration of plant food in a method later named fire-stick farming.Fire. The Australian Experience, 7. Such careful use of fire has been employed for centuries in the lands protected by Kakadu National Park to encourage biodiversity.Karki, 27. Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related debris flow in alluvial fans of northeastern Yellowstone National Park was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the Medieval Warm Period. However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. Dendrochronological fire scar data and charcoal layer data in Finland suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.Pitk√§nen, et al., 15‚Äì16 and 27‚Äì30 Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts. University of Oregon Summary, accessed 2 February 2010 A meta-analysis found that 17 times more land burned annually in California before 1800 compared to recent decades (1,800,000 hectares/year compared to 102,000 hectares/year). According to a paper published in Science, the number of natural and human-caused fires decreased by 24.3% between 1998 and 2015. Researchers explain this a transition from nomadism to settled lifestyle and intensification of agriculture that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing. Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. conifers) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in monoculturesFires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industryThe Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests Some invasive species, moved in by humans (i.e., for the pulp and paper industry) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as Eucalyptus in CaliforniaPlant flammability list and gamba grass in Australia. Prevention A short video on managing and protecting the natural habitat between a town and the hillside, from the risk of fire. Wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread.Karki, 6. Prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources, and to affect future fires.van Wagtendonk (1996), 1156. North American firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated.Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy, 42. However, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in Europe are related to human involvement.San-Miguel-Ayanz, et al., 361. Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land- clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.Karki, 7, 11‚Äì19. 1985 Smokey Bear poster with part of his admonition, \\"Only you can prevent forest fires\\". In 1937, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires. Later posters of the program featured Uncle Sam, characters from the Disney movie Bambi, and the official mascot of the U.S. Forest Service, Smokey Bear. Reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire. Alteration of fuels is commonly undertaken when attempting to affect future fire risk and behavior. Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns. Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions. A prescribed burn in a Pinus nigra stand in Portugal Strategies for wildfire prevention, detection, control and suppression have varied over the years. One common and inexpensive technique to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires is controlled burning: intentionally igniting smaller less-intense fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire.Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy, entire textNational Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management, entire text Vegetation may be burned periodically to limit the accumulation of plants and other debris that may serve as fuel, while also maintaining high species diversity.Fire. The Australian Experience, 5‚Äì6.Graham, et al., 15. Jan Van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station, claims that Wildfire itself is \\"the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area.\\"van Wagtendonk (1996), 1164 While other people claim that controlled burns and a policy of allowing some wildfires to burn is the cheapest method and an ecologically appropriate policy for many forests, they tend not to take into account the economic value of resources that are consumed by the fire, especially merchantable timber. Some studies conclude that while fuels may also be removed by logging, such thinning treatments may not be effective at reducing fire severity under extreme weather conditions. However, multi-agency studies conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the School of Forestry and Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana, through strategic assessments of fire hazards and the potential effectiveness and costs of different hazard reduction treatments, clearly demonstrate that the most effective short- and long-term forest fire hazard reduction strategy and by far the most cost-effective method to yield long-term mitigation of forest fire risk is a comprehensive fuel reduction strategy that involves mechanical removal of overstocked trees through commercial logging and non-commercial thinning with no restrictions on the size of trees that are removed, resulting in considerably better long-term results compared to a non-commercial \\"thin below\\" operation or a commercial logging operation with diameter restrictions. Starting with a forest with a \\"high risk\\" of fire and a pre-treatment crowning index of 21, the \\"thin from below\\" practice of removing only very small trees resulted in an immediate crowning index of 43, with 29% of the post-treatment area rated \\"low risk\\" immediately and only 20% of the treatment area remaining \\"low risk\\" after 30 years, at a cost (net economic loss) of $439 per acre treated. Again starting with a forest at \\"high risk\\" of fire and a crowning index of 21, the strategy involving non-commercial thinning and commercial logging with size-restrictions resulted in an crowning index of 43 immediately post-treatment with 67% of the area considered \\"low risk\\" and 56% of the area remaining low risk after 30 years, at a cost (net economic loss) of $368 per acre treated. On the other hand, starting with a forest at \\"high risk\\" of fire and the same crowning index of 21, a comprehensive fire hazard reduction treatment strategy, without restrictions on size of trees removed, resulted in an immediate crowning index of 61 post-treatment with 69% of the treated area rated \\"low risk\\" immediately and 52% of the treated area remaining \\"low risk\\" after 30 years, with positive revenue (a net economic gain gain) of $8 per acre. Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure. Communities in the Philippines also maintain fire lines wide between the forest and their village, and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather.Karki, 14. Continued residential development in fire- prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism. The ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life. Detection Dry Mountain Fire Lookout in the Ochoco National Forest, Oregon, circa 1930 Fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting.San-Miguel-Ayanz, et al., 362. Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger. Fire lookout towers were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs. Aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager. During the Yellowstone fires of 1988, a data station was established in West Yellowstone, permitting the delivery of satellite- based fire information in approximately four hours. Currently, public hotlines, fire lookouts in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by operator fatigue, time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude \\"...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer\\". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by GIS data analyses. An integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via Global Positioning System (GPS) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless Incident Command Centers.\\"Evaluation of three wildfire smoke detection systems\\", 4 A small, high risk area that features thick vegetation, a strong human presence, or is close to a critical urban area can be monitored using a local sensor network. Detection systems may include wireless sensor networks that act as automated weather systems: detecting temperature, humidity, and smoke. These may be battery-powered, solar-powered, or tree-rechargeable: able to recharge their battery systems using the small electrical currents in plant material. Larger, medium-risk areas can be monitored by scanning towers that incorporate fixed cameras and sensors to detect smoke or additional factors such as the infrared signature of carbon dioxide produced by fires. Additional capabilities such as night vision, brightness detection, and color change detection may also be incorporated into sensor arrays.\\"Evaluation of three wildfire smoke detection systems\\", 6San-Miguel-Ayanz, et al., 366‚Äì369, 373‚Äì375. Wildfires across the Balkans in late July 2007 (MODIS image) Satellite and aerial monitoring through the use of planes, helicopter, or UAVs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large, low risk areas. These more sophisticated systems employ GPS and aircraft-mounted infrared or high- resolution visible cameras to identify and target wildfires. Satellite-mounted sensors such as Envisat's Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer and European Remote-Sensing Satellite's Along-Track Scanning Radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires, identifying hot spots greater than . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System combines remote-sensing data from satellite sources such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for detection of fire and smoke plume locations. However, satellite detection is prone to offset errors, anywhere from for MODIS and AVHRR data and up to for GOES data. Satellites in geostationary orbits may become disabled, and satellites in polar orbits are often limited by their short window of observation time. Cloud cover and image resolution may also limit the effectiveness of satellite imagery. In 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) which uses data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions. The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long-duration wildfires ‚Äì capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12‚Äì18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season. In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger. The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2‚Äì4 billion annually on wildfire suppression. Suppression A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.Karki, 16 In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. Silver iodide can be used to encourage snow fall, while fire retardants and water can be dropped onto fires by unmanned aerial vehicles, planes, and helicopters.Plucinski, et al., 6 Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of per year. Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 Mann Gulch fire in Montana, United States, thirteen smokejumpers died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire. In the Australian February 2009 Victorian bushfires, at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.  Costs of wildfire suppression  In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large. While costs vary wildly from year to year, depending on the severity of each fire season, in the United States, local, state, federal and tribal agencies collectively spend tens of billions of dollars annually to suppress wildfires.  Wildland firefighting safety  Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw Hopkinton, New Hampshire Wildland fire fighters face several life- threatening hazards including heat stress, fatigue, smoke and dust, as well as the risk of other injuries such as burns, cuts and scrapes, animal bites, and even rhabdomyolysis. Between 2000‚Äì2016, more than 350 wildland firefighters died on-duty. Especially in hot weather conditions, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or heat stroke. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and fitness, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome personal protective equipment. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress. Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland firefighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde, as well as particulates such as ash and silica. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash. Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Firefighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems. Other injury hazards wildland firefighters face include slips, trips, falls, burns, scrapes, and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures. =Firefighter safety zone guidelines= The U.S. Forest Service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame. US Forest Service  Efforts To Update Firefighter Safety Zone Guidelines Fire retardants Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents. The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire. In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure. Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers. Fire retardants may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive. Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant. Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems. There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation. The current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardants are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats). After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine a mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area. Modeling Fire Propagation Model Wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression, increase the safety of firefighters and the public, and minimize damage. Using computational science, wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including wind speed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and Huygens' Principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.G.D. Richards, \\"An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution\\", Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.. 30:1163‚Äì1179, 1990.Finney, 1‚Äì3. Extreme value theory may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires. However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.Alvarado, et al., 66‚Äì68 2003 Canberra firestorm Human risk and exposure Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire. Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human- induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands. Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health. Global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk. Airborne hazards The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans. Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene. Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5 ¬µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats. Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects. The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract through inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the air quality index (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range. Fire ecologist Leda Kobziar found that wildfire smoke distributes microbial life on a global level. She stated, \\"There are numerous allergens that we‚Äôve found in the smoke. And so it may be that some people who are sensitive to smoke have that sensitivity, not only because of the particulate matter and the smoke but also because there are some biological organisms in it.\\" Post-fire risks Charred shrubland in suburban Sydney (2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfires). After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into ash pits.  At-risk groups  = Firefighters= Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above OSHA-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5‚Äì10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants (a combination of particulate matter 3.5 ¬µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehyde) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits. Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; slips, trips, and falls; injuries from vehicle rollovers; heat-related illness; insect bites and stings; stress; and rhabdomyolysis. = Residents = Smoke from the 2020 California wildfires settles over San Francisco Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0‚Äì4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods. They are also at risk for future wildfires and may move away to areas they consider less risky. Wildfires affect large numbers of people in Western Canada and the United States. In California alone, more than 350,000 people live in towns and cities in \\"very high fire hazard severity zones\\". = Fetal exposure = Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes. In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas. This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&search;_mode=GeneralSearch&qid;=1&SID;=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&page;=2&doc;=16 Asthma is one of the most common chronic disease among children in the United States affecting estimated 6.2 million children. A recent area of research on asthma risk focuses specifically on the risk of air pollution during the gestational period. Several pathophysiology processes are involved are in this. In human's considerable airway development occurs during the 2nd and 3rd trimester and continue until 3 years of age. It is hypothesized that exposure to these toxins during this period could have consequential effects as the epithelium of the lungs during this time could have increased permeability to toxins. Exposure to air pollution during parental and pre-natal stage could induce epigenetic changes which are responsible for the development of asthma. Recent Meta-Analyses have found significant association between PM2.5, NO2 and development of asthma during childhood despite heterogeneity among studies. Furthermore, maternal exposure to chronic stressor, which are most like to be present in distressed communities, which is also a relevant co relate of childhood asthma which may further help explain the early childhood exposure to air pollution, neighborhood poverty and childhood risk. Living in distressed neighborhood is not only linked to pollutant source location and exposure but can also be associated with degree of magnitude of chronic individual stress which can in turn alter the allostatic load of the maternal immune system leading to adverse outcomes in children, including increased susceptibility to air pollution and other hazards.  Health effects  Animation of diaphragmatic breathing with the diaphragm shown in green Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes. Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact. Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM2.5 however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe. PM2.5 is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire. This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to the fine particles from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.  Asthma exacerbation  Smoke from wildfires can cause health problems, especially for children and those who already have respiratory problems. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma. An observational study of smoke exposure related to the 2007 San Diego wildfires revealed an increase both in healthcare utilization and respiratory diagnoses, especially asthma among the group sampled. Projected climate scenarios of wildfire occurrences predict significant increases in respiratory conditions among young children. Particulate Matter (PM) triggers a series of biological processes including inflammatory immune response, oxidative stress, which are associated with harmful changes in allergic respiratory diseases. Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with asthma related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of quick-relief medications, such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with asthma. In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids. More specifically, some people with asthma reported higher use of quick-relief medications (inhalers). After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for quick-relief medications in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence. There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.  Carbon monoxide danger  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headaches, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma, and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia. A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990‚Äì2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks. Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and phobias. In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.  Epidemiology  The western US has seen an increase in both the frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere. The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated. Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality. In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas has precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease. An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. Looking at the wildfires in Southern California in October 2003 in a similar manner, investigators have shown an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma symptoms while being exposed to peak concentrations of PM in smoke. Another epidemiological study found a 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.25%, 15%) increase in risk of respiratory related hospital admissions during smoke wave days with high wildfire-specific particulate matter 2.5 compared to matched non-smoke-wave days. Children participating in the Children's Health Study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use and physician visits. Recently, it was demonstrated that mothers who were pregnant during the fires gave birth to babies with a slightly reduced average birth weight compared to those who were not exposed to wildfire during birth. Suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire. Worldwide it is estimated that 339,000 people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each year. While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke. health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels. Cultural aspects Wildfires have a place in many cultures. \\"To spread like wildfire\\" is a common idiom in English, meaning something that \\"quickly affects or becomes known by more and more people\\". The Smokey Bear fire prevention campaign has yielded one of the most popular characters in the United States; for many years there was a living Smokey Bear mascot, and it has been commemorated on postage stamps. Wildfire activity has been attributed as a major factor in the development of Ancient Greece. In modern Greece, as in many other regions, it is the most common natural disaster and figures prominently in the social and economic lives of its people.

In statistics and statistical physics, the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution from which direct sampling is difficult. This sequence can be used to approximate the distribution (e.g. to generate a histogram) or to compute an integral (e.g. an expected value). Metropolis‚ÄìHastings and other MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high. For single-dimensional distributions, there are usually other methods (e.g. adaptive rejection sampling) that can directly return independent samples from the distribution, and these are free from the problem of autocorrelated samples that is inherent in MCMC methods. History The algorithm was named after Nicholas Metropolis, who authored the 1953 article Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines together with Arianna W. Rosenbluth, Marshall Rosenbluth, Augusta H. Teller and Edward Teller. This article proposed the algorithm for the case of symmetrical proposal distributions, and W. K. Hastings extended it to the more general case in 1970. Some controversy exists with regard to credit for development of the algorithm. Metropolis had coined the term \\"Monte Carlo\\" in an earlier article with Stanislav Ulam, was familiar with the computational aspects of the method, and led the group in the Theoretical Division that designed and built the MANIAC I computer used in the experiments in 1952. However, prior to 2003, there was no detailed account of the algorithm's development. Then, shortly before his death, Marshall Rosenbluth attended a 2003 conference at LANL marking the 50th anniversary of the 1953 publication. At this conference, Rosenbluth described the algorithm and its development in a presentation titled \\"Genesis of the Monte Carlo Algorithm for Statistical Mechanics\\". Further historical clarification is made by Gubernatis in a 2005 journal article recounting the 50th anniversary conference. Rosenbluth makes it clear that he and his wife Arianna did the work, and that Metropolis played no role in the development other than providing computer time. This contradicts an account by Edward Teller, who states in his memoirs that the five authors of the 1953 article worked together for \\"days (and nights)\\". In contrast, the detailed account by Rosenbluth credits Teller with a crucial but early suggestion to \\"take advantage of statistical mechanics and take ensemble averages instead of following detailed kinematics\\". This, says Rosenbluth, started him thinking about the generalized Monte Carlo approach ‚Äì a topic which he says he had discussed often with Von Neumann. Arianna Rosenbluth recounted (to Gubernatis in 2003) that Augusta Teller started the computer work, but that Arianna herself took it over and wrote the code from scratch. In an oral history recorded shortly before his death, Rosenbluth again credits Teller with posing the original problem, himself with solving it, and Arianna with programming the computer. In terms of reputation, there is little reason to question Rosenbluth's account. In a biographical memoir of Rosenbluth, Freeman Dyson writes: Intuition The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm can draw samples from any probability distribution P(x), provided that we know a function f(x) proportional to the density of P and the values of f(x) can be calculated. The requirement that f(x) must only be proportional to the density, rather than exactly equal to it, makes the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm particularly useful, because calculating the necessary normalization factor is often extremely difficult in practice. The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm works by generating a sequence of sample values in such a way that, as more and more sample values are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution P(x). These sample values are produced iteratively, with the distribution of the next sample being dependent only on the current sample value (thus making the sequence of samples into a Markov chain). Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next sample value based on the current sample value. Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)‚Äîthe probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function f(x) of the current and candidate sample values with respect to the desired distribution P(x). For the purpose of illustration, the Metropolis algorithm, a special case of the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm where the proposal function is symmetric, is described below. Metropolis algorithm (symmetric proposal distribution) Let f(x) be a function that is proportional to the desired probability distribution P(x) (a.k.a. a target distribution). # Initialization: Choose an arbitrary point x_t to be the first sample and choose an arbitrary probability density g(x\\\\mid y) (sometimes written Q(x\\\\mid y)) that suggests a candidate for the next sample value x, given the previous sample value y. In this section, g is assumed to be symmetric; in other words, it must satisfy g(x\\\\mid y) = g(y\\\\mid x). A usual choice is to let g(x\\\\mid y) be a Gaussian distribution centered at y, so that points closer to y are more likely to be visited next, making the sequence of samples into a random walk. The function g is referred to as the proposal density or jumping distribution. # For each iteration t: #* Generate a candidate x' for the next sample by picking from the distribution g(x'\\\\mid x_t). #* Calculate the acceptance ratio \\\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t), which will be used to decide whether to accept or reject the candidate. Because f is proportional to the density of P, we have that \\\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t) = P(x')/P(x_t). #* Accept or reject: # Generate a uniform random number u \\\\in [0, 1]. # If u \\\\le \\\\alpha, then accept the candidate by setting x_{t+1} = x', # If u > \\\\alpha, then reject the candidate and set x_{t+1} = x_t instead. This algorithm proceeds by randomly attempting to move about the sample space, sometimes accepting the moves and sometimes remaining in place. Note that the acceptance ratio \\\\alpha indicates how probable the new proposed sample is with respect to the current sample, according to the distribution P(x). If we attempt to move to a point that is more probable than the existing point (i.e. a point in a higher-density region of P(x)), we will always accept the move. However, if we attempt to move to a less probable point, we will sometimes reject the move, and the larger the relative drop in probability, the more likely we are to reject the new point. Thus, we will tend to stay in (and return large numbers of samples from) high-density regions of P(x), while only occasionally visiting low-density regions. Intuitively, this is why this algorithm works and returns samples that follow the desired distribution P(x). Compared with an algorithm like adaptive rejection sampling that directly generates independent samples from a distribution, Metropolis‚ÄìHastings and other MCMC algorithms have a number of disadvantages: * The samples are correlated. Even though over the long term they do correctly follow P(x), a set of nearby samples will be correlated with each other and not correctly reflect the distribution. This means that if we want a set of independent samples, we have to throw away the majority of samples and only take every nth sample, for some value of n (typically determined by examining the autocorrelation between adjacent samples). Autocorrelation can be reduced by increasing the jumping width (the average size of a jump, which is related to the variance of the jumping distribution), but this will also increase the likelihood of rejection of the proposed jump. Too large or too small a jumping size will lead to a slow-mixing Markov chain, i.e. a highly correlated set of samples, so that a very large number of samples will be needed to get a reasonable estimate of any desired property of the distribution. * Although the Markov chain eventually converges to the desired distribution, the initial samples may follow a very different distribution, especially if the starting point is in a region of low density. As a result, a burn-in period is typically necessary, where an initial number of samples (e.g. the first 1000 or so) are thrown away. On the other hand, most simple rejection sampling methods suffer from the \\"curse of dimensionality\\", where the probability of rejection increases exponentially as a function of the number of dimensions. Metropolis‚ÄìHastings, along with other MCMC methods, do not have this problem to such a degree, and thus are often the only solutions available when the number of dimensions of the distribution to be sampled is high. As a result, MCMC methods are often the methods of choice for producing samples from hierarchical Bayesian models and other high-dimensional statistical models used nowadays in many disciplines. In multivariate distributions, the classic Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm as described above involves choosing a new multi-dimensional sample point. When the number of dimensions is high, finding the suitable jumping distribution to use can be difficult, as the different individual dimensions behave in very different ways, and the jumping width (see above) must be \\"just right\\" for all dimensions at once to avoid excessively slow mixing. An alternative approach that often works better in such situations, known as Gibbs sampling, involves choosing a new sample for each dimension separately from the others, rather than choosing a sample for all dimensions at once. This is especially applicable when the multivariate distribution is composed of a set of individual random variables in which each variable is conditioned on only a small number of other variables, as is the case in most typical hierarchical models. The individual variables are then sampled one at a time, with each variable conditioned on the most recent values of all the others. Various algorithms can be used to choose these individual samples, depending on the exact form of the multivariate distribution: some possibilities are the adaptive rejection sampling methods, the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm a simple one-dimensional Metropolis‚ÄìHastings step, or slice sampling. Formal derivation The purpose of the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is to generate a collection of states according to a desired distribution P(x). To accomplish this, the algorithm uses a Markov process, which asymptotically reaches a unique stationary distribution \\\\pi(x) such that \\\\pi(x) = P(x). A Markov process is uniquely defined by its transition probabilities P(x' \\\\mid x), the probability of transitioning from any given state x to any other given state x'. It has a unique stationary distribution \\\\pi(x) when the following two conditions are met: # Existence of stationary distribution: there must exist a stationary distribution \\\\pi(x). A sufficient but not necessary condition is detailed balance, which requires that each transition x \\\\to x' is reversible: for every pair of states x, x', the probability of being in state x and transitioning to state x' must be equal to the probability of being in state x' and transitioning to state x, \\\\pi(x) P(x' \\\\mid x) = \\\\pi(x') P(x \\\\mid x'). # Uniqueness of stationary distribution: the stationary distribution \\\\pi(x) must be unique. This is guaranteed by ergodicity of the Markov process, which requires that every state must (1) be aperiodic‚Äîthe system does not return to the same state at fixed intervals; and (2) be positive recurrent‚Äîthe expected number of steps for returning to the same state is finite. The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm involves designing a Markov process (by constructing transition probabilities) that fulfills the two above conditions, such that its stationary distribution \\\\pi(x) is chosen to be P(x). The derivation of the algorithm starts with the condition of detailed balance: : P(x' \\\\mid x) P(x) = P(x \\\\mid x') P(x'), which is re-written as : \\\\frac{P(x' \\\\mid x)}{P(x \\\\mid x')} = \\\\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}. The approach is to separate the transition in two sub-steps; the proposal and the acceptance-rejection. The proposal distribution g(x' \\\\mid x) is the conditional probability of proposing a state x' given x, and the acceptance distribution A(x', x) is the probability to accept the proposed state x'. The transition probability can be written as the product of them: : P(x'\\\\mid x) = g(x' \\\\mid x) A(x', x). Inserting this relation in the previous equation, we have : \\\\frac{A(x', x)}{A(x, x')} = \\\\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}\\\\frac{g(x \\\\mid x')}{g(x' \\\\mid x)}. The next step in the derivation is to choose an acceptance ratio that fulfills the condition above. One common choice is the Metropolis choice: : A(x', x) = \\\\min\\\\left(1, \\\\frac{P(x')}{P(x)} \\\\frac{g(x \\\\mid x')}{g(x' \\\\mid x)}\\\\right). For this Metropolis acceptance ratio A, either A(x', x) = 1 or A(x, x') = 1 and, either way, the condition is satisfied. The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm thus consists in the following: # Initialise ## Pick an initial state x_0. ## Set t = 0. # Iterate ##Generate a random candidate state x' according to g(x' \\\\mid x_t). ## Calculate the acceptance probability A(x', x_t) = \\\\min\\\\left(1, \\\\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)} \\\\frac{g(x_t \\\\mid x')}{g(x' \\\\mid x_t)}\\\\right). ## Accept or reject: ### generate a uniform random number u \\\\in [0, 1]; ### if u \\\\le A(x' , x_t), then accept the new state and set x_{t+1} = x'; ### if u > A(x' , x_t), then reject the new state, and copy the old state forward x_{t+1} = x_{t}. ## Increment: set t = t + 1. Provided that specified conditions are met, the empirical distribution of saved states x_0, \\\\ldots, x_T will approach P(x). The number of iterations (T) required to effectively estimate P(x) depends on the number of factors, including the relationship between P(x) and the proposal distribution and the desired accuracy of estimation.Raftery, Adrian E., and Steven Lewis. \\"How Many Iterations in the Gibbs Sampler?\\" In Bayesian Statistics 4. 1992. For distribution on discrete state spaces, it has to be of the order of the autocorrelation time of the Markov process. It is important to notice that it is not clear, in a general problem, which distribution g(x' \\\\mid x) one should use or the number of iterations necessary for proper estimation; both are free parameters of the method, which must be adjusted to the particular problem in hand.  Use in numerical integration  A common use of Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is to compute an integral. Specifically, consider a space \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} and a probability distribution P(x) over \\\\Omega, x \\\\in \\\\Omega. Metropolis‚ÄìHastings can estimate an integral of the form of : P(E) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega A(x) P(x) \\\\,dx, where A(x) is a (measurable) function of interest. For example, consider a statistic E(x) and its probability distribution P(E), which is a marginal distribution. Suppose that the goal is to estimate P(E) for E on the tail of P(E). Formally, P(E) can be written as : P(E) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega P(E\\\\mid x) P(x) \\\\,dx = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\delta\\\\big(E - E(x)\\\\big) P(x) \\\\,dx = E \\\\big(P(E\\\\mid X)\\\\big) and, thus, estimating P(E) can be accomplished by estimating the expected value of the indicator function A_E(x) \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{1}_E(x), which is 1 when E(x) \\\\in [E, E + \\\\Delta E] and zero otherwise. Because E is on the tail of P(E), the probability to draw a state x with E(x) on the tail of P(E) is proportional to P(E), which is small by definition. The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm can be used here to sample (rare) states more likely and thus increase the number of samples used to estimate P(E) on the tails. This can be done e.g. by using a sampling distribution \\\\pi(x) to favor those states (e.g. \\\\pi(x) \\\\propto e^{a E} with a > 0). Step-by-step instructions Suppose that the most recent value sampled is x_t. To follow the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm, we next draw a new proposal state x' with probability density g(x' \\\\mid x_t) and calculate a value : a = a_1 a_2, where : a_1 = \\\\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)} is the probability (e.g., Bayesian posterior) ratio between the proposed sample x' and the previous sample x_t, and : a_2 = \\\\frac{g(x_t \\\\mid x')}{g(x' \\\\mid x_t)} is the ratio of the proposal density in two directions (from x_t to x' and conversely). This is equal to 1 if the proposal density is symmetric. Then the new state x_{t+1} is chosen according to the following rules. : If a \\\\geq 1{:} :: x_{t+1} = x', : else: :: x_{t+1} = \\\\begin{cases} x' & \\\\text{with probability } a, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_t & \\\\text{with probability } 1 - a. \\\\end{cases} The Markov chain is started from an arbitrary initial value x_0, and the algorithm is run for many iterations until this initial state is \\"forgotten\\". These samples, which are discarded, are known as burn-in. The remaining set of accepted values of x represent a sample from the distribution P(x). The algorithm works best if the proposal density matches the shape of the target distribution P(x), from which direct sampling is difficult, that is g(x' \\\\mid x_t) \\\\approx P(x'). If a Gaussian proposal density g is used, the variance parameter \\\\sigma^2 has to be tuned during the burn-in period. This is usually done by calculating the acceptance rate, which is the fraction of proposed samples that is accepted in a window of the last N samples. The desired acceptance rate depends on the target distribution, however it has been shown theoretically that the ideal acceptance rate for a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution is about 50%, decreasing to about 23% for an N-dimensional Gaussian target distribution. If \\\\sigma^2 is too small, the chain will mix slowly (i.e., the acceptance rate will be high, but successive samples will move around the space slowly, and the chain will converge only slowly to P(x)). On the other hand, if \\\\sigma^2 is too large, the acceptance rate will be very low because the proposals are likely to land in regions of much lower probability density, so a_1 will be very small, and again the chain will converge very slowly. One typically tunes the proposal distribution so that the algorithms accepts on the order of 30% of all samples ‚Äì in line with the theoretical estimates mentioned in the previous paragraph. The result of three Markov chains running on the 3D Rosenbrock function using the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm. The algorithm samples from regions where the posterior probability is high, and the chains begin to mix in these regions. The approximate position of the maximum has been illuminated. Note that the red points are the ones that remain after the burn-in process. The earlier ones have been discarded.

San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989. is a triangular impossible object, an optical illusion consisting of an object which can be depicted in a perspective drawing, but cannot exist as a solid object. It was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv√§rd in 1934. Independently from Reutersv√§rd, the triangle was devised and popularized in the 1950s by psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, prominent Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Sir Roger Penrose, who described it as \\"impossibility in its purest form\\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Description A rotating penrose triangle model to show illusion The tribar appears to be a solid object, made of three straight beams of square cross- section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the triangle they form. The beams may be broken, forming cubes or cuboids. This combination of properties cannot be realized by any three-dimensional object in ordinary Euclidean space. Such an object can exist in certain Euclidean 3-manifolds. In the chapter on the Penrose tribar, Francis attributes this observation to John Stillwell. There also exist three-dimensional solid shapes each of which, when viewed from a certain angle, appears the same as the 2-dimensional depiction of the Penrose triangle on this page (such as ‚Äì for example ‚Äì the adjacent image depicting a sculpture in Perth, Australia). The term \\"Penrose triangle\\" can refer to the 2-dimensional depiction or the impossible object itself. If a line is traced around the Penrose triangle, a 4-loop M√∂bius strip is formed. Depictions A 3D-printed version of the Reutersvard Triangle illusion M.C. Escher's lithograph Waterfall (1961) depicts a watercourse that flows in a zigzag along the long sides of two elongated Penrose triangles, so that it ends up two stories higher than it began. The resulting waterfall, forming the short sides of both triangles, drives a water wheel. Escher points out that in order to keep the wheel turning, some water must occasionally be added to compensate for evaporation.

Thought to have originated in northern China, this rodent has now spread to all continents except Antarctica, and is the dominant rat in Europe and much of North America. With rare exceptions, the brown rat lives wherever humans live, particularly in urban areas. Selective breeding of the brown rat has produced the fancy rat (rats kept as pets), as well as the laboratory rat (rats used as model organisms in biological research).

(1915) The Rat. pp. 13. it is not known for certain why the brown rat is named Rattus norvegicus (Norwegian rat), as it did not originate from Norway. However, the English naturalist John Berkenhout, author of the 1769 book Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain, is most likely responsible for popularizing the misnomer. Berkenhout gave the brown rat the binomial name Rattus norvegicus, believing it had migrated to England from Norwegian ships in 1728. By the early to middle part of the 19th century, British academics believed that the brown rat was not native to Norway, hypothesizing (incorrectly) that it may have come from Ireland, Gibraltar or across the English Channel with William the Conqueror.Friends' Intelligencer. (1858) Volume 14. William W. Moore, publisher. pp. 398. As early as 1850, however, a new hypothesis of the rat's origins was beginning to develop.Chambers, William and Robert Chambers. (1850) Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. pp. 132. The British novelist Charles Dickens acknowledged this in his weekly journal, All the Year Round, writing: > Now there is a mystery about the native country of the best known species of > rat, the common brown rat. It is frequently called, in books and otherwise, > the 'Norway rat', and it is said to have been imported into this country in > a ship-load of timber from Norway. Against this hypothesis stands the fact > that when the brown rat had become common in this country, it was unknown in > Norway, although there was a small animal like a rat, but really a lemming, > which made its home there.Dickens, Charles. (1888) All the Year Round. New > Series. Volume XLII, Number 1018. pp. 517. Academics began to prefer this etymology of the brown rat towards the end of the 19th century, as seen in the 1895 text Natural History by American scholar Alfred Henry Miles: > The brown rat is the species common in England, and best known throughout > the world. It is said to have travelled from Persia to England less than two > hundred years ago and to have spread from thence to other countries visited > by English ships.Miles, Alfred Henry. (1895) Natural History. Dodd, Mead & > Company. pp. 227 Though the assumptions surrounding this species' origins were not yet the same as modern ones, by the 20th century, it was believed among naturalists that the brown rat did not originate in Norway, rather the species came from central Asia and (likely) China.Cornish, Charles John. (1908) The Standard Library of Natural History. The University Society, Inc. Volume 1, Chapter 9. pp. 159  Description  Comparison of the physique of a black rat (Rattus rattus) with a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) The fur is coarse and usually brown or dark grey, while the underparts are lighter grey or brown. The brown rat is a rather large murid and can weigh twice as much as a black rat (Rattus rattus) and many times more than a house mouse (Mus musculus). The head and body length ranges from while the tail ranges in length from , therefore being shorter than the head and body. Adult weight ranges from . Exceptionally large individuals can reportedly reach but are not expected outside of domestic specimens. Stories of rats attaining sizes as big as cats are exaggerations, or misidentifications of larger rodents, such as the coypu and muskrat. In fact, it is common for breeding wild brown rats to weigh (sometimes considerably) less than .Leslie, P. H., Perry, J. S., Watson, J. S., & ELTON, C. (February 1946). The Determination of the Median Body‚ÄêWeight at which Female Rats reach Maturity. In Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (Vol. 115, No. 3‚Äê4, pp. 473‚Äì488). Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Brown rats have acute hearing, are sensitive to ultrasound, and possess a very highly developed olfactory sense. Their average heart rate is 300 to 400 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of around 100 per minute. The vision of a pigmented rat is poor, around 20/600, while a non-pigmented (albino) with no melanin in its eyes has both around 20/1200 vision and a terrible scattering of light within its vision. Brown rats are dichromates which perceive colors rather like a human with red-green colorblindness, and their colour saturation may be quite faint. Their blue perception, however, also has UV receptors, allowing them to see ultraviolet lights that some species cannot.  Biology and behavior  Brown rat skull The brown rat is nocturnal and is a good swimmer, both on the surface and underwater, and has been observed climbing slim round metal poles several feet in order to reach garden bird feeders. Brown rats dig well, and often excavate extensive burrow systems. A 2007 study found brown rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only found in humans and some primates, but further analysis suggested they may have been following simple operant conditioning principles.  Communication  Brown rats are capable of producing ultrasonic vocalizations. As pups, young rats use different types of ultrasonic cries to elicit and direct maternal search behavior, as well as to regulate their mother's movements in the nest. Although pups will produce ultrasounds around any other rats at 7 days old, by 14 days old they significantly reduce ultrasound production around male rats as a defensive response. Adult rats will emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to predators or perceived danger; the frequency and duration of such cries depends on the sex and reproductive status of the rat. The female rat will also emit ultrasonic vocalizations during mating. = Chirping = Rats may also emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic, socially induced vocalization during rough and tumble play, before receiving morphine, or mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct \\"chirping\\", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is too high in pitch for humans to hear without special equipment. Bat detectors are often used by pet owners for this purpose. In research studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp appears to decline. =Audible communication= Brown rats also produce communicative noises capable of being heard by humans. The most commonly heard in domestic rats is bruxing, or teeth-grinding, which is most usually triggered by happiness, but can also be 'self-comforting' in stressful situations, such as a visit to the vet. The noise is best described as either a quick clicking or 'burring' sound, varying from animal to animal. Vigorous bruxing can be accompanied by boggling, where the eyes of the rat rapidly bulge and retract due to movement of the lower jaw muscles behind the eye socket. In addition, they commonly squeak along a range of tones from high, abrupt pain squeaks to soft, persistent 'singing' sounds during confrontations.  Diet  The brown rat is a true omnivore and will consume almost anything, but cereals form a substantial part of its diet.Brown rat eating sunflower seeds Martin Schein, founder of the Animal Behavior Society in 1964, studied the diet of brown rats and came to the conclusion that the most-liked foods of brown rats include scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, raw carrots, and cooked corn kernels. According to Schein, the least-liked foods were raw beets, peaches, and raw celery. Foraging behavior is often population-specific, and varies by environment and food source. Brown rats living near a hatchery in West Virginia catch fingerling fish. Some colonies along the banks of the Po River in Italy will dive for mollusks, a practice demonstrating social learning among members of this species. Rats on the island of Norderoog in the North Sea stalk and kill sparrows and ducks.  Reproduction and life cycle  The brown rat can breed throughout the year if conditions are suitable, with a female producing up to five litters a year. The gestation period is only 21 days, and litters can number up to 14, although seven is common. They reach sexual maturity in about five weeks. Under ideal conditions (for the rat), this means that the population of females could increase by a factor of three and a half (half a litter of 7) in 8 weeks (5 weeks for sexual maturity and 3 weeks of gestation), corresponding to a population growing by a factor of 10 in just 15 weeks. As a result, the population can grow from 2 to 15,000 in a year. The maximum life span is three years, although most barely manage one. A yearly mortality rate of 95% is estimated, with predators and interspecies conflict as major causes. When lactating, female rats display a 24-hour rhythm of maternal behavior, and will usually spend more time attending to smaller litters than large ones. Brown rats live in large, hierarchical groups, either in burrows or subsurface places, such as sewers and cellars. When food is in short supply, the rats lower in social order are the first to die. If a large fraction of a rat population is exterminated, the remaining rats will increase their reproductive rate, and quickly restore the old population level. Females are capable of becoming pregnant immediately after giving birth, and can nurse one litter while pregnant with another. Females are able to produce and raise two healthy litters of normal size and weight without significantly changing their own food intake. However, when food is restricted, females can extend pregnancy by over two weeks, and give birth to litters of normal number and weight.  Mating behaviors  Males can ejaculate multiple times in a row, and this increases the likelihood of pregnancy as well as decreases the number of stillborns. Multiple ejaculation also means that males can mate with multiple females, and they exhibit more ejaculatory series when there are several oestrous females present. Males also copulate at shorter intervals than females. In group mating, females often switch partners. Dominant males have higher mating success and also provide females with more ejaculate, and females are more likely to use the sperm of dominant males for fertilization. In mating, female rats show a clear mating preference for unknown males versus males that they have already mated with (also known as the Coolidge effect), and will often resume copulatory behavior when introduced to a novel sexual partner. Females also prefer to mate with males who have not experienced social stress during adolescence, and can determine which males were stressed even without any observed difference in sexual performance of males experiencing stress during adolescence and not.  Social behavior  Rats commonly groom each other and sleep together. Rats are said to establish an order of hierarchy, so one rat will be dominant over another one. Groups of rats tend to \\"play fight\\", which can involve any combination of jumping, chasing, tumbling, and \\"boxing\\". Play fighting involves rats going for each other's necks, while serious fighting involves strikes at the others' back ends. If living space becomes limited, rats may turn to aggressive behavior, which may result in the death of some animals, reducing the burden over the living space. Rats, like most mammals, also form family groups of a mother and her young.Barnett, S. (1975). The Rat: a study in behavior (pp. 52‚Äì115). Chicago, MI: The University of Chicago Press. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are territorial animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self- grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.  Burrowing  Rats are known to burrow extensively, both in the wild and in captivity, if given access to a suitable substrate. Rats generally begin a new burrow adjacent to an object or structure, as this provides a sturdy \\"roof\\" for the section of the burrow nearest to the ground's surface.Calhoun, J. B. (1962) Bethesda, MD: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Burrows usually develop to eventually include multiple levels of tunnels, as well as a secondary entrance. Older male rats will generally not burrow, while young males and females will burrow vigorously. Burrows provide rats with shelter and food storage, as well as safe, thermo- regulated nest sites. Rats use their burrows to escape from perceived threats in the surrounding environment; for example, rats will retreat to their burrows following a sudden, loud noise or while fleeing an intruder. Burrowing can therefore be described as a \\"pre-encounter defensive behavior\\", as opposed to a \\"post-encounter defensive behavior\\", such as flight, freezing, or avoidance of a threatening stimulus.  Distribution and habitat  Possibly originating from the plains of Asia, northern China and Mongolia, the brown rat spread to other parts of the world sometime in the Middle Ages. The question of when brown rats became commensal with humans remains unsettled, but as a species, they have spread and established themselves along routes of human migration and now live almost everywhere humans are. The brown rat may have been present in Europe as early as 1553, a conclusion drawn from an illustration and description by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his book Historiae animalium, published 1551‚Äì1558.Freye, H.A., and Thenius, E. (1968) Die Nagetiere. Grzimeks Tierleben. (B. Grzimek, ed.) Volume 11. Kindler, Zurich. pp. 204‚Äì211. Though Gesner's description could apply to the black rat, his mention of a large percentage of albino specimens‚Äînot uncommon among wild populations of brown rats‚Äîadds credibility to this conclusion.Suckow et al. (2006) The Laboratory Rat, 2nd ed. Academic Press. pp. 74. . Reliable reports dating to the 18th century document the presence of the brown rat in Ireland in 1722, England in 1730, France in 1735, Germany in 1750, and Spain in 1800, becoming widespread during the Industrial Revolution. It did not reach North America until around 1750‚Äì1755.Nowak, Robert M. (1999) Walker's Mammals of the World. JHU Press. pp. 1521. . As it spread from Asia, the brown rat generally displaced the black rat in areas where humans lived. In addition to being larger and more aggressive, the change from wooden structures and thatched roofs to bricked and tiled buildings favored the burrowing brown rats over the arboreal black rats. In addition, brown rats eat a wider variety of foods, and are more resistant to weather extremes.Teisha Rowland. \\"Ancient Origins of Pet Rats\\" , Santa Barbara Independent, 4 December 2009. In the absence of humans, brown rats prefer damp environments, such as river banks. However, the great majority are now linked to man-made environments, such as sewage systems. East Village of New York City It is often said that there are as many rats in cities as people, but this varies from area to area depending on climate, living conditions, etc. Brown rats in cities tend not to wander extensively, often staying within of their nest if a suitable concentrated food supply is available, but they will range more widely where food availability is lower. It is difficult to determine the extent of their home range because they do not utilize a whole area but rather use regular runways to get from one location to another. There is great debate over the size of the population of rats in New York City, with estimates from almost 100 million rats to as few as 250,000. Experts suggest that New York is a particularly attractive place for rats because of its aging infrastructure and high poverty rates. In addition to sewers, rats are very comfortable living in alleyways and residential buildings, as there is usually a large and continuous food source in those areas. In the United Kingdom, some figures show that the rat population has been rising, with estimations that 81 million rats reside in the UK. Those figures would mean that there are 1.3 rats per person in the country. High rat populations in the UK are often attributed to the mild climate, which allow them higher survival rates during the winter. With the increase in global temperature and glacier retreat it is estimated that brown rat populations will see an increase. The only brown rat-free areas in the world are the continent of Antarctica, the Arctic, some isolated islands, the Canadian province of Alberta, and certain conservation areas in New Zealand.Perrow, Martin and A. J. Davy. (2002) Handbook of Ecological Restoration. Cambridge University Press. pp. 362‚Äì363. . Antarctica is almost completely covered by ice, making it uninhabitable by rats. The Arctic has extremely cold winters that rats cannot survive outdoors, and the human population density is extremely low, making it difficult for rats to travel from one habitation to another, although they have arrived in many coastal areas by ship. When the occasional rat infestation is found and eliminated, the rats are unable to reinfest it from an adjacent one. Isolated islands are also able to eliminate rat populations because of low human population density and the geographic distance from other rat populations. Faroe Islands The brown rat was first observed on the Faroe Islands in 1768. It is thought that the first individuals arrived on the southernmost island, Su√∞uroy, via the wreck of a Norwegian ship that had stranded on the Scottish Isle of Lewis on its way from Trondheim to Dublin. The drifting wreck, carrying brown rats, drifted northwards until it reached the village of Hvalba. Dispersion afterwards appears to have been fast, including all of Su√∞uroy within a year. In 1769, they were observed in Torshavn on the southern part of Streymoy, and a decade later, in the villages in the northern part of this island. From here, they crossed the strait and occupied Eysturoy during the years 1776 to 1779. In 1779, they reached Vagar. Whether the rats dispersed from the already established population in Su√∞uroy, or they were brought to the Faroe Islands with other ships, is unknown. The Northern islands were invaded by the brown rat more than 100 years later, after Norwegians built and operated a whaling station in the village of Hvannasund on Bor√∞oy from 1898 to 1920. From there, the brown rat spread to the neighbouring islands of Vi√∞oy and Kunoy. A recent genomic analysis reveals three independent introductions of the invasive brown rat to the Faroe Islands. Today the brown rat is found on seven of the 18 Faroese islands, and is common in and around human habitations as well as in the wild. Although the brown rat is now common on all of the largest Faroese islands, only sparse information on the population is available in the literature. An investigation for infection with the spirochaete Leptospira interrogans did not find any infected animals, suggesting that Leptospira prevalence rates on the Faroe Islands may be among the lowest recorded worldwide. Alaska Hawadax Island (formerly known as Rat Island) in Alaska was infested with brown rats following a Japanese shipwreck in 1780. They had a devastating effect on the native bird life. An eradication program was started in 2007 and the island was declared rat-free in June 2009. Alberta Alberta, Canada, is the largest rat-free populated area in the world. Rat invasions of Alberta were stopped and rats were eliminated by very aggressive government rat control measures, starting during the 1950s. The only species of Rattus that is capable of surviving the climate of Alberta is the brown rat, which can only survive in the prairie region of the province, and even then must overwinter in buildings. Although it is a major agricultural area, Alberta is far from any seaport and only a portion of its eastern boundary with Saskatchewan provides a favorable entry route for rats. Brown rats cannot survive in the wild boreal forest to the north, the Rocky Mountains to the west, nor can they safely cross the semiarid High Plains of Montana to the south. The first brown rat did not reach Alberta until 1950, and in 1951, the province launched a rat-control program that included shooting, poisoning, and gassing rats, and bulldozing or burning down some rat-infested buildings. The effort was backed by legislation that required every person and every municipality to destroy and prevent the establishment of designated pests. If they failed, the provincial government could carry out the necessary measures and charge the costs to the landowner or municipality. In the first year of the rat control program, of arsenic trioxide were spread throughout 8,000 buildings on farms along the Saskatchewan border. However, in 1953 the much safer and more effective rodenticide, warfarin was introduced to replace arsenic. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that was approved as a drug for human use in 1954 and is much safer to use near humans and other large animals than arsenic. By 1960, the number of rat infestations in Alberta had dropped to below 200 per year. In 2002, the province finally recorded its first year with zero rat infestations, and from 2002 to 2007 there were only two infestations found. After an infestation of rats in the Medicine Hat landfill was found in 2012, the province's rat-free status was questioned, but provincial government rat control specialists brought in excavating machinery, dug out, shot, and poisoned 147 rats in the landfill, and no live rats were found thereafter. In 2013, the number of rat infestations in Alberta dropped to zero again. Alberta defines an infestation as two or more rats found at the same location, since a single rat cannot reproduce. About a dozen single rats enter Alberta in an average year and are killed by provincial rat control specialists before they can reproduce. Only zoos, universities, and research institutes are allowed to keep caged rats in Alberta, and possession of unlicensed rats (including pet rats) by anyone else is punishable by a penalty of up to $5,000 or up to 60 days in jail. The adjacent and similarly landlocked province of Saskatchewan initiated a rat control program in 1972, and has managed to reduce the number of rats in the province substantially, although they have not been eliminated. The Saskatchewan rat control program has considerably reduced the number of rats trying to enter Alberta. New Zealand First arriving before 1800 (perhaps on James Cook's vessels), brown rats pose a serious threat to many of New Zealand's native wildlife. Rat eradication programmes within New Zealand have led to rat-free zones on offshore islands and even on fenced \\"ecological islands\\" on the mainland. Before an eradication effort was launched in 2001, the sub-Antarctic Campbell Island had the highest population density of brown rats in the world. Predator Free 2050 aims to eradicate rats from the entirety of New Zealand. Diseases Similar to other rodents, brown rats may carry a number of pathogens, which can result in disease, including Weil's disease, rat bite fever, cryptosporidiosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the United Kingdom, brown rats are an important reservoir for Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever, with seroprevalence for the bacteria found to be as high as 53% in some wild populations. This species can also serve as a reservoir for Toxoplasma gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, though the disease usually spreads from rats to humans when domestic cats feed on infected brown rats. The parasite has a long history with the brown rat, and there are indications that the parasite has evolved to alter an infected rat's perception to cat predation, making it more susceptible to predation and increasing the likelihood of transmission. Surveys and specimens of brown rat populations throughout the world have shown this species is often associated with outbreaks of trichinosis,Samuel et al. (2001) Parasitic Diseases of Wild Mammals. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 380‚Äì393. . but the extent to which the brown rat is responsible in transmitting Trichinella larvae to humans and other synanthropic animals is at least somewhat debatable. Trichinella pseudospiralis, a parasite previously not considered to be a potential pathogen in humans or domestic animals, has been found to be pathogenic in humans and carried by brown rats. They can also be responsible in transmitting Angiostrongylus larvae to humans by eating raw or undercooked snails, slugs, mollusks, crustaceans, water and/or vegetables contaminated with them. Brown rats are sometimes mistakenly thought to be a major reservoir of bubonic plague, a possible cause of the Black Death. However, the bacterium responsible, Yersinia pestis, is commonly endemic in only a few rodent species and is usually transmitted zoonotically by rat fleas‚Äîcommon carrier rodents today include ground squirrels and wood rats. However, brown rats may suffer from plague, as can many nonrodent species, including dogs, cats, and humans. The original carrier for the plague-infected fleas thought to be responsible for the Black Death was the black rat, and it has been hypothesized that the displacement of black rats by brown rats led to the decline of bubonic plague.See e.g., *John M. Last. \\"Black Death\\", Encyclopedia of Public Health, eNotes website. Retrieved 31 December 2010. *Ethne Barnes. Diseases and Human Evolution, University of New Mexico Press, 2007, , p. 247. This theory has, however, been deprecated, as the dates of these displacements do not match the increases and decreases in plague outbreaks.See e.g.: *Alfred J. Bollet. Plagues & Poxes: The Impact of Human History on Epidemic Disease, Demos Medical Publishing, 2004, , p. 23. *Tracy Hamler Carrick, Nancy Carrick, Lawrence Finsen.

In captivity Uses in science Selective breeding of albino brown rats rescued from being killed in a now-outlawed sport called rat baiting has produced the albino laboratory rat. Like mice, these rats are frequently subjects of medical, psychological and other biological experiments, and constitute an important model organism. This is because they grow quickly to sexual maturity and are easy to keep and to breed in captivity. When modern biologists refer to \\"rats\\", they almost always mean Rattus norvegicus. As pets The brown rat is kept as a pet in many parts of the world. Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are just a few of the countries that have formed fancy rat associations similar in nature to the American Kennel Club, establishing standards, orchestrating events, and promoting responsible pet ownership. The many different types of domesticated brown rats include variations in coat patterns, as well as the style of the coat, such as Hairless or Rex, and more recently developed variations in body size and structure, including dwarf and tailless fancy rats. Working rats A working rat is a rat trained for specific tasks as a working animal. In many cases, working rats are domesticated brown rats. However, other species, notably the Gambian pouched rat, have been trained to assist humans.

It consists of a two-dimensional figure which is instantly and subconsciously interpreted by the visual system as representing a projection of a three-dimensional object. In most cases the impossibility becomes apparent after viewing the figure for a few seconds. However, the initial impression of a 3D object remains even after it has been contradicted. There are also more subtle examples of impossible objects where the impossibility does not become apparent spontaneously and it is necessary to consciously examine the geometry of the implied object to determine that it is impossible. The unsettling nature of impossible objects occurs because of our natural desire to interpret 2D drawings as three-dimensional objects. This is why a drawing of a Necker cube would be most likely seen as a cube, rather than \\"two squares connected with diagonal lines, a square surrounded by irregular planar figures, or any other planar figure.\\" With an impossible object, looking at different parts of the object makes one reassess the 3D nature of the object, which confuses the mind. Impossible objects are of interest to psychologists, mathematicians and artists without falling entirely into any one discipline. Notable examples Notable impossible objects include: * Borromean rings ‚Äî although conventionally drawn as three linked circles in three-dimensional space, any realization must be non-circular * Impossible cube ‚Äì The impossible cube was invented by M.C. Escher for Belvedere, a lithograph in which a boy seated at the foot of the building holds an impossible cube. * Penrose stairs ‚Äì The Penrose staircase was created by Oscar Reutersv√§rd and later independently devised and popularised by Lionel Penrose and his son Roger Penrose. A variation on the Penrose triangle, it is a two-dimensional depiction of a staircase in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend yet form a continuous loop, so that a person could climb them forever and never get any higher. * Penrose triangle (Tribar) ‚Äì The Penrose triangle was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv√§rd in 1934. The mathematician Roger Penrose independently devised and popularised it in the 1950s, describing it as \\"impossibility in its purest form\\". * Impossible trident (or devil's tuning fork) ‚Äì The Blivet has three cylindrical prongs at one end which then mysteriously transform into two rectangular prongs at the other end. * L'egsistential Quandary ‚Äì Created by Roger Shepard in 1990, L'egsistential Quandary is a drawing of an elephant whose four feet are drawn at the bottom of the white space between legs, instead of on the legs themselves. History An early example of an impossible object comes from Apolin√®re Enameled, a 1916 advertisement painted by Marcel Duchamp. It depicts a girl painting a bed-frame with white enamelled paint, and deliberately includes conflicting perspective lines, to produce an impossible object. To emphasise the deliberate impossibility of the shape, a piece of the frame is missing. A 3D-printed version of the Reutersv√§rd Triangle illusion, its appearance created by a left Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv√§rd was one of the first to deliberately design many impossible objects. He has been called \\"the father of impossible figures\\". In 1934 he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. In Reutersv√§rd's version the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes. In 1956, British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, mathematician Roger Penrose, submitted a short article to the British Journal of Psychology titled \\"Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion\\". This was illustrated with the Penrose triangle and Penrose stairs. The article referred to Escher, whose work had sparked their interest in the subject, but not Reutersv√§rd, of whom they were unaware. The article was published in 1958. From the 1930s onwards, Dutch artist M.C. Escher produced many drawings featuring paradoxes of perspective gradually working towards impossible objects. In 1957, he produced his first drawing containing a true impossible object: Cube with Magic Ribbons. He produced many further drawings featuring impossible objects, sometimes with the entire drawing being an impossible object. Waterfall and Belvedere are good examples of impossible constructions. His work did much to draw the attention of the public to impossible objects. Some contemporary artists are also experimenting with impossible figures, for example, Jos de Mey, Shigeo Fukuda, Sandro del Prete, Istv√°n Orosz (Utisz), Guido Moretti, Tam√°s F. Farkas, Mathieu Hamaekers, and Kokichi Sugihara. Constructed impossible objects Although possible to represent in two dimensions, it is not geometrically possible for such an object to exist in the physical world. However some models of impossible objects have been constructed, such that when they are viewed from a very specific point, the illusion is maintained. Rotating the object or changing the viewpoint breaks the illusion, and therefore many of these models rely on forced perspective or having parts of the model appearing to be further or closer than they actually are. The notion of an \\"interactive impossible object\\" is an impossible object that can be viewed from any angle without breaking the illusion. See also   References Further reading * Bower, Gordon H.

He saw active service during the Second World War. Life before the war Stirling was born at his family's ancestral home, Keir House in the parish of Lecropt, Perthshire. He was the son of Brigadier General Archibald Stirling, of Keir, and Margaret Fraser, daughter of Simon Fraser, the Lord Lovat (a descendant of Charles II, King of Scots); hence Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat was a first cousin. His paternal grandparents were Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet and Lady Anna Maria Leslie-Melville. He was educated at the Catholic boarding school Ampleforth College, but attended only a year at Trinity College, Cambridge before departing to Paris to become an artist. A tall and athletic figure, he was training to climb Mount Everest when World War II broke out. Second World War and the founding of the SAS Stirling was commissioned into the Scots Guards from Ampleforth College Contingent Officer Training Corps on 24 July 1937. In June 1940, he volunteered for the new No. 8 Commando under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Laycock, which became part of Force Z (later named \\"Layforce\\"). On 1 February 1941, Layforce sailed for the Middle East, in support of the capture of Rhodes, but were soon disbanded after suffering heavy casualties in the Battle of Crete and the Battle of the Litani River. Stirling remained convinced that due to the mechanised nature of war, a small team of highly trained soldiers with the advantage of surprise could attack several targets from the desert in a single night. Believing that taking his idea up through the chain of command was unlikely to work, Stirling decided to go straight to the top. On crutches following a parachuting accident, he stealthily entered Middle East headquarters in Cairo (under, through, or over a fence) in an effort to see Commander-in-Chief General Claude Auchinleck. Spotted by guards, he abandoned his crutches and entered the building, only to come face-to-face with an officer with whom he had previously fallen out. Retreating rapidly, he entered the office of the deputy chief of staff General Ritchie. Stirling explained his plan to Ritchie, the latter immediately persuaded Auchinleck to allow Stirling to form a new special operations unit. The unit was given the deliberately misleading name \\"L Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade\\" to reinforce Dudley Clarke's deception of a parachute brigade existing in North Africa. They were short of equipment, particularly tents and related gear, at the outset when they set up base at Kibrit Air Base. The first operation of the new SAS was to relieve a nearby well-equipped New Zealand regiment of tents, bedding, tables, chairs, numerous other supplies, including a piano. After at least four trips, they had a well stocked camp. After a brief period of training, an initial attempt at attacking a German airfield by parachute landing on 16 November 1941 in support of Operation Crusader was disastrous. Of the original 55 men, some 34 were killed, wounded or captured far from the target after being blown off course or landing in the wrong area, during one of the biggest storms to hit the area. Escaping only with the help of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) who were designated to pick up the unit after the attack, Stirling agreed that approaching by land under the cover of night would be safer and more effective than parachuting. As quickly as possible he organised raids on ports using this simple method, often bluffing through checkpoints at night using the language skills of some of his soldiers. Under his leadership, the Lewes bomb, the first hand-held dual explosive and incendiary device, was invented by Jock Lewes. American Jeeps, which were able to deal with the harsh desert terrain better than other transport, were cut down, adapted and fitted with Vickers K machine guns fore and aft. He also pioneered the use of small groups to escape detection. Finding it difficult to lead from the rear, Stirling often led from the front, his SAS units driving through enemy airfields to shoot up aircraft and crew, replacing the early operational strategy of attaching bombs to enemy aircraft on foot. The first Jeep-borne airfield raid occurred soon after acquiring the first batch of Jeeps in June 1942, when Stirling's SAS group attacked Italian-held Bagush airfield along with two other Axis airfields all in the same night. After returning to Cairo, Stirling collected a consignment of more Jeeps for further airfield raids. His biggest success was on the night of 26‚Äì27 July 1942 when his SAS squadron with 18 jeeps raided the Sidi Haneish landing strip and destroyed 37 Axis aircraft, mostly bombers and heavy transport, for the loss of one man killed. After a drive through the desert and evading enemy patrols and aircraft, Stirling and his men reached the safety of their advance camp at Qaret Tartura on the edge of the Qattara Depression. These hit-and-run operations eventually proved Stirling's undoing; he was captured by the Germans in January 1943 having been dubbed \\"The Phantom Major\\" by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Although he escaped, he was subsequently re-captured by the Italians, who took great delight in the embarrassment this caused to their German allies. A further four escape attempts were made, before Stirling was finally sent to Colditz Castle, where he remained for the rest of the war. He arrived on 20 August 1944 and was given the task of setting up the Colditz British Intelligence Unit. After his capture Paddy Mayne took command of the SAS. In North Africa, in the fifteen months before Stirling's capture, the SAS had destroyed over 250 aircraft on the ground, dozens of supply dumps, wrecked railways and telecommunications, and had put hundreds of enemy vehicles out of action. Field Marshal Montgomery described Stirling as \\"mad, quite mad\\" but believed that men like Stirling were needed in time of war. Private military company Worried that Britain was losing its power after the war, Stirling organised deals to provide British weapons and military personnel to other countries, like Saudi Arabia, for various privatised foreign policy operations.Adam Curtis, The Mayfair Set Along with several associates, Stirling formed Watchguard International Ltd, formerly with offices in Sloane Street (where the Chelsea Hotel later opened) before moving to South Audley Street in Mayfair. Business was chiefly with the Gulf States. He was linked, along with Denys Rowley, to a failed attempt to overthrow the Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 1970 or 1971. Stirling was the founder of private military company KAS International, also known as KAS Enterprises. Watchguard International Ltd was a private military company, registered in Jersey in 1965 by Stirling and John Woodhouse. Woodhouse's first assignment was to go to Yemen to report on the state of the royalist forces when a cease-fire was declared. At the same time Stirling was cultivating his contacts in the Iranian government and exploring the chances of obtaining work in Africa. The company operated in Zambia and in Sierra Leone, providing training teams and advising on security matters, but its founders' maverick ways of doing business caused its eventual downfall. Woodhouse resigned as Director of Operations after a series of disagreements and Stirling ceased to take an active part in 1972.The SAS: Savage Wars of Peace: 1947 to the Present, by Anthony Kemp, John Murray, 1994, pp. 88-89 Great Britain 75 In mid-1970s, Stirling became increasingly worried that an \\"undemocratic event\\" would occur and decided to take action. He created an organisation called Great Britain 75 and recruited members from the aristocratic clubs in Mayfair; these were mainly ex-military men, and often former SAS members. The plan was that in the event of civil unrest result in the breakdown of normal Government operations, they would take over its running. He described this in detail in an interview from 1974, part of which is featured in Adam Curtis's documentary The Mayfair Set, episode 1: \\"Who Pays Wins\\". In August 1974, before Stirling was ready to go public with GB75, the pacifist magazine Peace News obtained and published his plans, and eventually Stirling ‚Äì dismayed by the right-wing character of many of those seeking to join GB75 ‚Äì abandoned the scheme. His biographer Alan Hoe rebutted the newspaper's disparaging portrayal of Stirling as a rightist 'Colonel Blimp'. Undermining trade unionism During the mid to late 1970s, Stirling created a secret organisation designed to undermine trade unionism from within. He recruited like-minded individuals from within the trade union movement, with the express intention that they should cause as much trouble during conferences as permissible. One such member was Kate Losinska, who was Head of the Civil and Public Services Association. Funding for this \\"operation\\" came primarily from his friend Sir James Goldsmith. Later life Transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers in 1947, Stirling was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel, a rank he retained on his retirement in 1965. Stirling was the founder of the Capricorn Africa Society, a society for promoting an Africa free from racial discrimination. Founded in 1949, while Africa was still under colonial rule, it had its high point at the 1956 Salima Conference. However, because of his emphasis on a qualified and highly elitist voting franchise, similar to Disraeli's \\"fancy franchises\\", educated Africans were divided on it. Consequently, the society's attempt to deal with the problem of different levels of social development in a non- racial way was ineffective, although it received a surprising validation when the South African Communist Party used Stirling's multi-racial elitist model for its 1955 \\"Congress Alliance\\" when taking over the African National Congress of South Africa.Bernard Leeman. Mandela, Sobukwe, Leballo and Mokhehle (Azania Press 2008), p. 32. Stirling resigned as Chairman of the Society in 1959. That year his younger brother William incurred huge gambling debts and was obliged to note to casino owner John Aspinall - I owe you ¬£173,500 in the accountant's ledger. One night in 1967, he lost a further ¬£150,000.Richard Davenport-Hines.

In 2002 the SAS memorial, a statue of Stirling standing on a rock, was unveiled on the Hill of Row near his family's estate at Park of Keir. Two bronze plaques were stolen from the statue sometime around the end of May 2014. The current Laird of the Keir estate is his nephew Archie Stirling, a millionaire businessman and former Scots Guards officer.

It is a simple wire-frame drawing of a cube with no visual cues as to its orientation, so it can be interpreted to have either the lower-left or the upper-right square as its front side. Ambiguity The Necker cube is an ambiguous drawing. Necker cube on the left, impossible cube on the right. The effect is interesting because each part of the picture is ambiguous by itself, yet the human visual system picks an interpretation of each part that makes the whole consistent. The Necker cube is sometimes used to test computer models of the human visual system to see whether they can arrive at consistent interpretations of the image the same way humans do. Humans do not usually see an inconsistent interpretation of the cube. A cube whose edges cross in an inconsistent way is an example of an impossible object, specifically an impossible cube (compare Penrose triangle). With the cube on the left, most people see the lower-left face as being in front most of the time. This is possibly because people view objects from above, with the top side visible, far more often than from below, with the bottom visible, so the brain \\"prefers\\" the interpretation that the cube is viewed from above. Another reason behind this may be due to the brain's natural preference of viewing things from left to right, therefore seeing the leftmost square as being in front. There is evidence that by focusing on different parts of the figure, one can force a more stable perception of the cube. The intersection of the two faces that are parallel to the observer forms a rectangle, and the lines that converge on the square form a \\"y-junction\\" at the two diagonally opposite sides. If an observer focuses on the upper \\"y-junction\\" the lower left face will appear to be in front. The upper right face will appear to be in front if the eyes focus on the lower junction. Blinking while being on the second perception will probably cause you to switch to the first one. This is an example of two identical necker cubes, the one on the left showing an intermediate object (blue bar) going in \\"down from the top\\" while the one on the right shows the object going in \\"up from the bottom\\" which shows how the image can change its perspective simply by changing which face (front or back) appears behind the intervening object. It is possible to cause the switch to occur by focusing on different parts of the cube. If one sees the first interpretation on the right it is possible to cause a switch to the second by focusing on the base of the cube until the switch occurs to the second interpretation. Similarly, if one is viewing the second interpretation, focusing on the left side of the cube may cause a switch to the first. The Necker cube has shed light on the human visual system. The phenomenon has served as evidence of the human brain being a neural network with two distinct equally possible interchangeable stable states. Sidney Bradford, blind from the age of ten months but regaining his sight following an operation at age 52, did not perceive the ambiguity that normal-sighted observers do, but rather perceived only a flat image. During the 1970s, undergraduates in the Psychology Department of City University, London, were provided with assignments to measure their Introversion- Extroversion orientations by the time it took for them to switch between the Front and Back perceptions of the Necker Cube. Apparent viewpoint The orientation of the Necker cube can also be altered by shifting the observer's point of view. When seen from apparent above, one face tends to be seen closer; and in contrast, when seen from a subjective viewpoint that is below, a different face comes to the fore. References in popular culture The Necker cube is discussed to such extent in Robert J. Sawyer's 1998 science fiction novel Factoring Humanity that \\"Necker\\" becomes a verb, meaning to impel one's brain to switch from one perspective or perception to another. The Necker cube is used to illustrate how vampires in Peter Watts' science fiction novels Blindsight (2006) and Echopraxia (2014) have superior pattern recognition skills. One of the pieces of evidence is that vampires can see both interpretations of the Necker Cube simultaneously which sets them apart from baseline humanity.

Urbanization (or urbanisation) refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas, the decrease in the proportion of people living in rural areas, and the ways in which societies adapt to this change. It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas. Although the two concepts are sometimes used interchangeably, urbanization should be distinguished from urban growth. Whereas urbanization refers to the proportion of the total national population living in areas classified as urban, urban growth strictly refers to the absolute number of people living in those areas. The United Nations has projected that half of the world's population will live in urban areas at the end of 2008. It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized. That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and Asia. Notably, the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2017 to 2030 will be by cities, with about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 10 years. Urbanization is relevant to a range of disciplines, including urban planning, geography, sociology, architecture, economics, and public health. The phenomenon has been closely linked to modernization, industrialization, and the sociological process of rationalization. Urbanization can be seen as a specific condition at a set time (e.g. the proportion of total population or area in cities or towns), or as an increase in that condition over time. Therefore, urbanization can be quantified either in terms of the level of urban development relative to the overall population, or as the rate at which the urban proportion of the population is increasing. Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the \\"potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.\\" Urbanization is not merely a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and historic transformation of human social roots on a global scale, whereby predominantly rural culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly urban culture. The first major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of hunter-gatherers into villages many thousand years ago. Village culture is characterized by common bloodlines, intimate relationships, and communal behavior, whereas urban culture is characterized by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations, and competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of people is forecast to continue and intensify during the next few decades, mushrooming cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago. As a result, the world urban population growth curve has up till recently followed a quadratic-hyperbolic pattern.Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.

Cities such as Tehran, Istanbul, Mexico City, S√£o Paulo, London, Moscow, New York City, Lagos, Los Angeles, and Cairo are, or soon will be, home to over 15 million people each. History Urbanization over the past 500 years A global map illustrating the first onset and spread of urban centers around the world, based on. From the development of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and Egypt until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the vast majority of the population who were engaged in subsistence agriculture in a rural context, and small centres of populations in the towns where economic activity consisted primarily of trade at markets and manufactures on a small scale. Due to the primitive and relatively stagnant state of agriculture throughout this period, the ratio of rural to urban population remained at a fixed equilibrium. However, a significant increase in the percentage of the global urban population can be traced in the 1st millennium BCE. Another significant increase can be traced to Mughal India, where 15% of its population lived in urban centers during the 16th‚Äì17th centuries, higher than in Europe at the time.Abraham Eraly (2007), The Mughal World: Life in India's Last Golden Age, p. 5, Penguin Books In comparison, the percentage of the European population living in cities was 8‚Äì13% in 1800. Urbanization of the human population accelerated rapidly beginning in the middle of the eighteenth century. With the onset of the British agricultural and industrial revolution in the late 18th century, this relationship was finally broken and an unprecedented growth in urban population took place over the course of the 19th century, both through continued migration from the countryside and due to the tremendous demographic expansion that occurred at that time. In England and Wales, the proportion of the population living in cities with more than 20,000 people jumped from 17% in 1801 to 54% in 1891. Moreover, and adopting a broader definition of urbanization, we can say that while the urbanized population in England and Wales represented 72% of the total in 1891, for other countries the figure was 37% in France, 41% in Prussia and 28% in the United States. As labourers were freed up from working the land due to higher agricultural productivity they converged on the new industrial cities like Manchester and Birmingham which were experiencing a boom in commerce, trade, and industry. Growing trade around the world also allowed cereals to be imported from North America and refrigerated meat from Australasia and South America. Spatially, cities also expanded due to the development of public transport systems, which facilitated commutes of longer distances to the city centre for the working class. Urbanization rapidly spread across the Western world and, since the 1950s, it has begun to take hold in the developing world as well. At the turn of the 20th century, just 15% of the world population lived in cities. According to the UN, the year 2007 witnessed the turning point when more than 50% of the world population were living in cities, for the first time in human history. Yale University in June 2016 published urbanization data from the time period 3700 BC to 2000 AD, the data was used to make a video showing the development of cities on the world during the time period. The origins and spread of urban centers around the world were also mapped by archaeologists. Causes Population age comparises between rural Pocahontas County, Iowa and urban Johnson County, Iowa, illustrating the flight of young adults (red) to urban centres in Iowa.based on 2000 U.S. Census Data The City of Chicago, Illinois is an example of the early American grid system of development. The grid is enforced even on uneven topography. Urbanization occurs either organically or planned as a result of individual, collective and state action. Living in a city can be culturally and economically beneficial since it can provide greater opportunities for access to the labor market, better education, housing, and safety conditions, and reduce the time and expense of commuting and transportation. Conditions like density, proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition are elements of an urban environment that deemed beneficial. However, there are also harmful social phenomena that arise, alienation, stress, increased cost of living, and mass marginalization that are connected to an urban way of living. Suburbanization, which is happening in the cities of the largest developing countries, may be regarded as an attempt to balance these harmful aspects of urban life while still allowing access to the large extent of shared resources. In cities, money, services, wealth and opportunities are centralized. Many rural inhabitants come to the city to seek their fortune and alter their social position. Businesses, which provide jobs and exchange capital, are more concentrated in urban areas. Whether the source is trade or tourism, it is also through the ports or banking systems, commonly located in cities, that foreign money flows into a country. Many people move into cities for economic opportunities, but this does not fully explain the very high recent urbanization rates in places like China and India. Rural flight is a contributing factor to urbanization. In rural areas, often on small family farms or collective farms in villages, it has historically been difficult to access manufactured goods, though the relative overall quality of life is very subjective, and may certainly surpass that of the city. Farm living has always been susceptible to unpredictable environmental conditions, and in times of drought, flood or pestilence, survival may become extremely problematic. In a New York Times article concerning the acute migration away from farming in Thailand, life as a farmer was described as \\"hot and exhausting\\". \\"Everyone says the farmer works the hardest but gets the least amount of money\\". In an effort to counter this impression, the Agriculture Department of Thailand is seeking to promote the impression that farming is \\"honorable and secure\\". However, in Thailand, urbanization has also resulted in massive increases in problems such as obesity. Shifting from a rural environment to an urbanized community also caused a transition to a diet that was mainly carbohydrate-based to a diet higher in fat and sugar, consequently causing a rise in obesity. City life, especially in modern urban slums of the developing world, is certainly hardly immune to pestilence or climatic disturbances such as floods, yet continues to strongly attract migrants. Examples of this were the 2011 Thailand floods and 2007 Jakarta flood. Urban areas are also far more prone to violence, drugs, and other urban social problems. In the United States, industrialization of agriculture has negatively affected the economy of small and middle-sized farms and strongly reduced the size of the rural labour market. Particularly in the developing world, conflict over land rights due to the effects of globalization has led to less politically powerful groups, such as farmers, losing or forfeiting their land, resulting in obligatory migration into cities. In China, where land acquisition measures are forceful, there has been far more extensive and rapid urbanization (54%) than in India (36%), where peasants form militant groups (e.g. Naxalites) to oppose such efforts. Obligatory and unplanned migration often results in the rapid growth of slums. This is also similar to areas of violent conflict, where people are driven off their land due to violence. Cities offer a larger variety of services, including specialist services not found in rural areas. These services require workers, resulting in more numerous and varied job opportunities. Elderly people may be forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can cater to their health needs. Varied and high-quality educational opportunities are another factor in urban migration, as well as the opportunity to join, develop, and seek out social communities. Urbanization also creates opportunities for women that are not available in rural areas. This creates a gender-related transformation where women are engaged in paid employment and have access to education. This may cause fertility to decline. However, women are sometimes still at a disadvantage due to their unequal position in the labour market, their inability to secure assets independently from male relatives and exposure to violence. People in cities are more productive than in rural areas. An important question is whether this is due to agglomeration effects or whether cities simply attract those who are more productive. Urban geographers have shown that there exists a large productivity gain due to locating in dense agglomerations.Borowiecki, Karol J. (2013) Geographic Clustering and Productivity: An Instrumental Variable Approach for Classical Composers, Journal of Urban Economics, 73(1): 94‚Äì110 It is thus possible that agents locate in cities in order to benefit from these agglomeration effects. Dominant conurbation The dominant conurbation(s) of a country can benefit to a greater extent from the same things cities offer, making them magnets for not just the non-urban population, but also urban and suburban population from other cities. Dominant conurbations are quite often primate cities, but do not have to be. For instance Greater Manila is rather a conurbation than a city: its 20 million overall population (over 20% national population) make it very much a primate city, but Quezon City (2.7 million), the largest municipality in Greater Manila, and Manila (1.6 million), the capital, are not. A conurbation's dominance can be measured by output, wealth, and especially population, each expressed as a percentage of an entire country. Greater Seoul is one conurbation with massive dominance over South Korea, it is home to 50% of the entire national population. Though Greater Busan-Ulsan (15%, 8 million) and Greater Osaka (14%, 18 million) exhibit strong dominance in their respective countries, they are losing population to their even more dominant rivals, Seoul and Tokyo respectively. Economic effects  BTS Station during the rush hour in Bangkok, Thailand As cities develop, effects can include a dramatic increase and change in costs, often pricing the local working class out of the market, including such functionaries as employees of the local municipalities. For example, Eric Hobsbawm's book The age of revolution: 1789‚Äì1848 (published 1962 and 2005) chapter 11, stated \\"Urban development in our period [1789‚Äì1848] was a gigantic process of class segregation, which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government, business, and the newly specialized residential areas of the bourgeoisie. The almost universal European division into a 'good' west end and a 'poor' east end of large cities developed in this period.\\" This is likely due to the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones. Similar problems now affect the developing world, rising inequality resulting from rapid urbanization trends. The drive for rapid urban growth and often efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development. Think tanks such as the Overseas Development Institute have proposed policies that encourage labor-intensive growth as a means of absorbing the influx of low-skilled and unskilled labor.Grant, Ursula (2008) Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets London: Overseas Development Institute One problem these migrant workers are involved with is the growth of slums. In many cases, the rural- urban low skilled or unskilled migrant workers, attracted by economic opportunities in urban areas, cannot find a job and afford housing in cities and have to dwell in slums. Urban problems, along with infrastructure developments, are also fueling suburbanization trends in developing nations, though the trend for core cities in said nations tends to continue to become ever denser. Urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend, but there are positives in the reduction of expenses in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity and diversity.Using the Gall-Peters Projection it is estimated that come 2015 the worlds urban population is set to exceed 4 billion, most of this growth is expected in Africa and Asia and China to be 50% urbanized. While cities have a greater variety of markets and goods than rural areas, infrastructure congestion, monopolization, high overhead costs, and the inconvenience of cross-town trips frequently combine to make marketplace competition harsher in cities than in rural areas. In many developing countries where economies are growing, the growth is often erratic and based on a small number of industries. For young people in these countries, barriers exist such as lack of access to financial services and business advisory services, difficulty in obtaining credit to start a business, and lack of entrepreneurial skills, in order for them to access opportunities in these industries. Investment in human capital so that young people have access to quality education and infrastructure to enable access to educational facilities is imperative to overcoming economic barriers. Environmental effects The existence of urban heat islands has become a growing concern over the years. An urban heat island is formed when industrial and urban areas produce and retain heat. Much of the solar energy that reaches rural areas is consumed by evaporation of water from vegetation and soil. In cities, where there are less vegetation and exposed soil, most of the sun's energy is instead absorbed by buildings and asphalt; leading to higher surface temperatures. Vehicles, factories, and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units release even more heat.Park, H.-S. (1987). Variations in the urban heat island intensity affected by geographical environments. Environmental Research Center papers, no. 11. Ibaraki, Japan: Environmental Research Center, The University of Tsukuba. As a result, cities are often 1 to 3 ¬∞C (1.8 to 5.4 ¬∞F) warmer than surrounding landscapes.\\"Heat Island Effect\\". Epa.gov (17 November 2010). Retrieved on 7 April 2014. Impacts also include reducing soil moisture and a reduction in reabsorption of carbon dioxide emissions. In his book Whole Earth Discipline, Stewart Brand argues that the effects of urbanization are primarily positive for the environment. First, the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate and keeps falling, reducing environmental stresses caused by population growth.Urbanization: An Environmental Force to Be Reckoned With Secondly, emigration from rural areas reduces destructive subsistence farming techniques, such as improperly implemented slash and burn agriculture. Urbanization may improve environmental quality as a result of numerous reasons. For instance, urbanization upsurges income levels which instigates the eco-friendly services sector and increases demand for green and environmentally compliant products. Furthermore, urbanization improves environmental eminence through superior facilities and better-quality living standards in urban areas as compared to rural areas. Lastly, urbanization curbs pollution emissions by increasing R&D; and innovations. In the book \\"Carbon Zero: Imagining Cities that can save the planet\\", Alex Steffen also speaks of the environmental benefits of increasing the urbanization level.Carbon Zero: Imagining Cities that can save the planet by Alex Steffen In July 2013 a report issued by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\\"World Economic and Social Survey (WESS) 2013\\" World Economic and Social Affairs. July 2013. warned that with 2.4 billion more people by 2050, the amount of food produced will have to increase by 70%, straining food resources, especially in countries already facing food insecurity due to changing environmental conditions. The mix of changing environmental conditions and the growing population of urban regions, according to UN experts, will strain basic sanitation systems and health care, and potentially cause a humanitarian and environmental disaster.Auber, Tamar (17 July 2013) \\"Climate change and rapid urban expansion in Africa threaten children‚Äôs lives.\\" UNEARTH News. Retrieved 10 August 2013.  Water quality  The occurrence of eutrophication in bodies of water is another effect large urban populations have on the environment. When rain occurs in these large cities, the rain filters down the pollutants such as CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the air onto the ground below. Then, those chemicals are washed directly into rivers, streams, and oceans, causing a decline in water quality and damaging marine ecosystems. Eutrophication is a process which causes hypoxic water conditions and algal blooms that may be detrimental to the survival of aquatic life. Harmful algal blooms, which produce dangerous toxins, thrive in eutrophic environments that are also rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. In these ideal conditions, they overtake surface water, making it difficult for other organisms to receive sunlight and nutrients. Overgrowth of algal blooms causes a decrease in overall water quality and disrupts the natural balance of aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, as algal blooms die, CO2 is produced, causing a more acidic environment, a process known as acidification. The ocean's surface also has the ability to absorb CO2 from the earth's atmosphere as emissions increase with the rise in urbanization. In fact, it is reported that the ocean absorbs a quarter of the CO2 produced by humans. This has been useful to the environment by decreasing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases, but also further perpetuates acidification. Changes in pH inhibit the proper formation of calcium carbonate, a crucial component for many marine organisms to maintain shells or skeletons. This is especially true for many species of mollusks and coral. Regardless, some species have been able to instead adapt or thrive in a more acidic environment  Food waste  Rapid growth of communities create new challenges in the developed world and one such challenge is an increase in food waste also known as urban food waste. Food waste is the disposal of food products that can no longer be used due to unused products, expiration, or spoilage. The increase of food waste can raise environmental concerns such as increase production of methane gases and attraction of disease vectors. Landfills are the third leading cause of the release of methane, causing a concern on its impact to our ozone and on the health of individuals. Accumulation of food waste causes increased fermentation, which increases the risk of rodent and bug migration. An increase in migration of disease vectors creates greater potential of disease spreading to humans.  Habitat fragmentation  Urbanization can have a large effect on biodiversity by causing a division of habitats and thereby alienation of species, a process known as habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation does not destroy the habitat, as seen in habitat loss, but rather breaks it apart with things like roads and railways This change may affect a species ability to sustain life by separating it from the environment in which it is able to easily access food, and find areas that they may hide from predation With proper planning and management, fragmentation can be avoided by adding corridors that aid in the connection of areas and allow for easier movement around urbanized regions. Depending on the various factors, such as level of urbanization, both increases or decreases in \\"species richness\\" can be seen. This means that urbanization may be detrimental to one species but also help facilitate the growth of others. In instances of housing and building development, many times vegetation is completely removed immediately in order to make it easier and less expensive for construction to occur, thereby obliterating any native species in that area. Habitat fragmentation can filter species with limited dispersal capacity. For example, aquatic insects are found to have lower species richness in urban landscapes. The more urbanized the surrounding of habitat is, the fewer species can reach the habitat. Other times, such as with birds, urbanization may allow for an increase in richness when organisms are able to adapt to the new environment. This can be seen in species that may find food while scavenging developed areas or vegetation that has been added after urbanization has occurred i.e. planted trees in city areas Health and social effects In the developing world, urbanization does not translate into a significant increase in life expectancy. Rapid urbanization has led to increased mortality from non- communicable diseases associated with lifestyle, including cancer and heart disease. Differences in mortality from contagious diseases vary depending on the particular disease and location. Urban health levels are on average better in comparison to rural areas. However, residents in poor urban areas such as slums and informal settlements suffer \\"disproportionately from disease, injury, premature death, and the combination of ill-health and poverty entrenches disadvantage over time.\\" Many of the urban poor have difficulty accessing health services due to their inability to pay for them; so they resort to less qualified and unregulated providers. While urbanization is associated with improvements in public hygiene, sanitation and access to health care, it also entails changes in occupational, dietary, and exercise patterns. It can have mixed effects on health patterns, alleviating some problems, and accentuating others. Nutrition One such effect is the formation of food deserts. Nearly 23.5 million people in the United States lack access to supermarkets within one mile of their home. Several studies suggest that long distances to a grocery store are associated with higher rates of obesity and other health disparities. Food deserts in developed countries often correspond to areas with a high-density of fast food chains and convenience stores that offer little to no fresh food. Urbanization has been shown to be associated with the consumption of less fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and a higher consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Poor access to healthy food and high intakes of fat, sugar and salt are associated with a greater risk for obesity, diabetes and related chronic disease. Overall, body mass index and cholesterol levels increase sharply with national income and the degree of urbanization.[40] Food deserts in the United States are most commonly found in low-income and predominately African American neighborhoods. One study on food deserts in Denver, Colorado found that, in addition to minorities, the affected neighborhoods also had a high proportion of children and new births.Stilley, Megan. The University of Colorado at Denver, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2012. 1509386. In children, urbanization is associated with a lower risk of under-nutrition but a higher risk of overweight.[39] Asthma Urbanization has also been associated with an increased risk of asthma as well. Throughout the world, as communities transition from rural to more urban societies, the number of people affected by asthma increases. The odds of reduced rates of hospitalization and death from asthmas has decreased for children and young adults in urbanized municipalities in Brazil. This finding indicates that urbanization may have a negative impact on population health particularly affecting people's susceptibility to asthma. In low and middle income countries many factors contribute to the high numbers of people with asthma. Similar to areas in the United States with increasing urbanization, people living in growing cities in low income countries experience high exposure to air pollution, which increases the prevalence and severity of asthma among these populations. Links have been found between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and allergic diseases. Children living in poor, urban areas in the United States now have an increased risk of morbidity due to asthma in comparison to other low-income children in the United States. In addition, children with croup living in urban areas have higher hazard ratios for asthma than similar children living in rural areas. Researchers suggest that this difference in hazard ratios is due to the higher levels of air pollution and exposure to environmental allergens found in urban areas. Exposure to elevated levels of ambient air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), can cause DNA methylation of CpG sites in immune cells, which increases children's risk of developing asthma. Studies have shown a positive correlation between Foxp3 methylation and children's exposure to NO2, CO, and PM2.5. Furthermore, any amount of exposure to high levels of air pollution have shown long term effects on the Foxp3 region. Despite the increase in access to health services that usually accompanies urbanization, the rise in population density negatively affects air quality ultimately mitigating the positive value of health resources as more children and young adults develop asthma due to high pollution rates. However, urban planning, as well as emission control, can lessen the effects of traffic- related air pollution on allergic diseases such as asthma. Crime Historically, crime and urbanization have gone hand in hand. The simplest explanation is that areas with a higher population density are surrounded by greater availability of goods. Committing crimes in urbanized areas is also more feasible. Modernization has led to more crime as well, as the modern media has raised greater awareness of the income gap between the rich and the poor. This leads to feelings of deprivation, which in turn can lead to crime. In some regions where urbanization happens in wealthier areas, a rise in property crime and a decrease in violent crime is seen.Shelley, L. I. (1981). Crime and modernization: The impact of industrialization and urbanization on crime. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press. Data shows that there is an increase in crime in urbanized areas. Some factors include per capita income, income inequality, and overall population size. There is also a smaller association between unemployment rate, police expenditures and crime.Gumus, E. (2004). Crime in urban areas: An empirical investigation. The presence of crime also has the ability to produce more crime. These areas have less social cohesion and therefore less social control. This is evident in the geographical regions that crime occurs in. As most crime tends to cluster in city centers, the further the distance from the center of the city, the lower the occurrence of crimes are.Bruinsma, G. J. (2007). Urbanization and urban crime: Dutch geographical and environmental research. Crime and Justice, 35(1), 453-502. Migration is also a factor that can increase crime in urbanized areas. People from one area are displaced and forced to move into an urbanized society. Here they are in a new environment with new norms and social values. This can lead to less social cohesion and more crime.Malik, A. A. (2016). Urbanization and Crime: A Relational Analysis. J. HUMAN. & Soc. Scl., 21, 68-69. Physical activity Although urbanization tends to produce more negative effects, one positive effect that urbanization has impacted is an increase in physical activity in comparison to rural areas. Residents of rural areas and communities in the United States have higher rates of obesity and engage in less physical activity than urban residents. Rural residents consume a higher percent of fat calories and are less likely to meet the guidelines for physical activity and more likely to be physically inactive. In comparison to regions within the United States, the west has the lowest prevalence of physical inactivity and the south has the highest prevalence of physical inactivity. Metropolitan and large urban areas across all regions have the highest prevalence of physical activity among residents. Barriers such as geographic isolation, busy and unsafe roads, and social stigmas lead to decreased physical activity in rural environments. Faster speed limits on rural roads prohibits the ability to have bike lanes, sidewalks, footpaths, and shoulders along the side of the roads. Less developed open spaces in rural areas, like parks and trails, suggest that there is lower walkability in these areas in comparison to urban areas. Many residents in rural settings have to travel long distances to utilize exercise facilities, taking up too much time in the day and deterring residents from using recreational facilities to obtain physical activity. Additionally, residents of rural communities are traveling further for work, decreasing the amount of time that can be spent on leisure physical activity and significantly decreases the opportunity to partake in active transportation to work. Neighborhoods and communities with nearby fitness venues, a common feature of urbanization, have residents that partake in increased amounts of physical activity. Communities with sidewalks, street lights, and traffic signals have residents participating in more physical activity than communities without those features. Having a variety of destinations close to where people live, increases the use of active transportation, such as walking and biking. Active transportation is also enhanced in urban communities where there is easy access to public transportation due to residents walking or biking to transportation stops. In a study comparing different regions in the United States, opinions across all areas were shared that environmental characteristics like access to sidewalks, safe roads, recreational facilities, and enjoyable scenery are positively associated with participation in leisure physical activity. Perceiving that resources are nearby for physical activity increases the likelihood that residents of all communities will meet the guidelines and recommendations for appropriate physical activity. Specific to rural residents, the safety of outdoor developed spaces and convenient availability to recreational facilities matters most when making decisions on increasing physical activity. In order to combat the levels of inactivity in rural residents, more convenient recreational features, such as the ones discussed in this paragraph, need to be implemented into rural communities and societies.  Mental health  Urbanization factors that contribute to mental health can be thought of as factors that affect the individual and factors that affect the larger social group. At the macro, social group level, changes related to urbanization are thought to contribute to social disintegration and disorganization. These macro factors contribute to social disparities which affect individuals by creating perceived insecurity. Perceived insecurity can be due problems with the physical environment, such as issues with personal safety, or problems with the social environment, such as a loss of positive self-concepts from negative events. Increased stress is a common individual psychological stressor that accompanies urbanization and is thought to be due to perceived insecurity. Changes in social organization, a consequence of urbanization, are thought to lead to reduced social support, increased violence, and overcrowding. It is these factors that are thought to contribute to increased stress. It is important to note that urbanization or population density alone does not cause mental health problems. It is the combination of urbanization with physical and social risk factors that contribute to mental health problems. As cities continue to expand it is important to consider and account for mental health along with other public health measures that accompany urbanization. Changing forms Different forms of urbanization can be classified depending on the style of architecture and planning methods as well as the historic growth of areas. Map showing urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006. In cities of the developed world urbanization traditionally exhibited a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area, the so-called in- migration. In-migration refers to migration from former colonies and similar places. The fact that many immigrants settle in impoverished city centres led to the notion of the \\"peripheralization of the core\\", which simply describes that people who used to be at the periphery of the former empires now live right in the centre. Recent developments, such as inner-city redevelopment schemes, mean that new arrivals in cities no longer necessarily settle in the centre. In some developed regions, the reverse effect, originally called counter urbanization has occurred, with cities losing population to rural areas, and is particularly common for richer families. This has been possible because of improved communications and has been caused by factors such as the fear of crime and poor urban environments. It has contributed to the phenomenon of shrinking cities experienced by some parts of the industrialized world. When the residential area shifts outward, this is called suburbanization. A number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as India. This networked, poly-centric form of concentration is considered by some emerging pattern of urbanization. It is called variously edge city (Garreau, 1991), network city (Batten, 1995), postmodern city (Dear, 2000), or exurb, though the latter term now refers to a less dense area beyond the suburbs. Los Angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization. In the United States, this process has reversed as of 2011, with \\"re-urbanization\\" occurring as suburban flight due to chronically high transport costs. Rural migrants are attracted by the possibilities that cities can offer, but often settle in shanty towns and experience extreme poverty. The inability of countries to provide adequate housing for these rural migrants is related to overurbanization, a phenomenon in which the rate of urbanization grows more rapidly than the rate of economic development, leading to high unemployment and high demand for resources. In the 1980s, this was attempted to be tackled with the urban bias theory which was promoted by Michael Lipton. Most of the urban poor in developing countries unable to find work can spend their lives in insecure, poorly paid jobs. According to research by the Overseas Development Institute pro-poor urbanization will require labour-intensive growth, supported by labour protection, flexible land use regulation and investments in basic services.' Urbanization can be planned urbanization or organic. Planned urbanization, i.e.: planned community or the garden city movement, is based on an advance plan, which can be prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or urban design reasons. Examples can be seen in many ancient cities; although with exploration came the collision of nations, which meant that many invaded cities took on the desired planned characteristics of their occupiers. Many ancient organic cities experienced redevelopment for military and economic purposes, new roads carved through the cities, and new parcels of land were cordoned off serving various planned purposes giving cities distinctive geometric designs. UN agencies prefer to see urban infrastructure installed before urbanization occurs. Landscape planners are responsible for landscape infrastructure (public parks, sustainable urban drainage systems, greenways etc.) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterwards to revitalize an area and create greater livability within a region. Concepts of control of the urban expansion are considered in the American Institute of Planners. As population continues to grow and urbanize at unprecedented rates, new urbanism and smart growth techniques are implemented to create a transition into developing environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable cities. Smart Growth and New Urbanism's principles include walkability, mixed-use development, comfortable high- density design, land conservation, social equity, and economic diversity. Mixed-use communities work to fight gentrification with affordable housing to promote social equity, decrease automobile dependency to lower use of fossil fuels, and promote a localized economy. Walkable communities have a 38% higher average GDP per capita than less walkable urban metros (Leinberger, Lynch). By combining economic, environmental, and social sustainability, cities will become equitable, resilient, and more appealing than urban sprawl that overuses land, promotes automobile use, and segregates the population economically.http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/foot-traffic- ahead.pdf See also Historical *Neolithic Revolution *Urban Revolution *Polis *Oppidum Regional *Urbanization in Africa *Urbanization in China *Urbanization in India *Urbanization in Pakistan *Urbanization in the United States References Further reading Bairoch, Paul.

Human migration Industrial Revolution Land use Urban development ","title":"Urbanization"},{"id":"56116","text":"Salting the earth, or sowing with salt, is the ritual of spreading salt on conquered cities to symbolize a curse on their re-inhabitation. It originated as a symbolic practice in the ancient Near East and became a well-established folkloric motif in the Middle Ages. Destroying cities The custom of purifying or consecrating a destroyed city with salt and cursing anyone who dared to rebuild it was widespread in the ancient Near East, but historical accounts are unclear as to what the sowing of salt meant in that process. Various Hittite and Assyrian texts speak of ceremonially strewing salt, minerals, or plants (weeds, \\"cress\\", or kudimmu, which are associated with salt and desolationWeinfeld, Moshe. Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School, 1992, , p. 110) over destroyed cities, including Hattusa, Taidu, Arinna, Hunusa, Irridu,Chavalas, Mark. The ancient Near East: historical sources in translation pp. 144‚Äì145. and Susa.Persians: Masters of Empire, by the editors of Time-Life Books. Alexandria, Va.: Time-Life Books, 1995. pp. 7‚Äì8. The Book of Judges (9:45) says that Abimelech, the judge of the Israelites, sowed his own capital, Shechem, with salt, c. 1050 BC, after quelling a revolt against him. This may have been part of a ·∏•ƒìrem ritual (see Salt in the Bible). At least as early as 1863, various texts claimed that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus plowed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after defeating it in the Third Punic War (146 BC), sacking it, and enslaving the survivors. The salting was probably modeled on the story of Shechem. Though ancient sources do mention symbolically drawing a plow over various cities and salting them, none mention Carthage in particular. The salting story entered the academic literature in Bertrand Hallward's article in the first edition of the Cambridge Ancient History, and was taken up by others. It was discredited by scholars in the 1980s. When Pope Boniface VIII destroyed Palestrina in 1299, he ordered that it be plowed \\"following the old example of Carthage in Africa\\", and also salted. \\"I have run the plough over it, like the ancient Carthage of Africa, and I have had salt sown upon it ...\\" The text is not clear as to whether he thought Carthage was salted. Later accounts of other saltings in the destructions of medieval Italian cities are now rejected as unhistorical: Padua by Attila (452), perhaps in a parallel between Attila and the ancient Assyrians; Milan by Frederick Barbarossa (1162); and Semifonte by the Florentines (1202). The English epic poem Siege of Jerusalem (c. 1370) recounts that Titus commanded the sowing of salt on the Temple,Hanna, Ralph and David Lawton, eds., The Siege of Jerusalem, 2003, line 1295 but this episode is not found in Josephus' account. Punishing traitors Stone memorial to the Duke of Aveiro's punishment in Santa Maria de Bel√©m, Lisbon. In Spain and the Spanish Empire, salt was poured onto the land owned by a convicted traitor (often one who was executed and their head placed on a picota, or pike, afterwards) after their house was demolished. This was done in Portugal as well. The last known event of this sort was the destruction of the Duke of Aveiro's palace in Lisbon in 1759, due to his participation in the T√°vora affair (a conspiracy against King Joseph I of Portugal). His palace was demolished and his land was salted.Joseph Hughes, An authentick letter from Mr. Hughes, a Gentleman residing at Lisbon ..., London 1759, p. 25 A stone memorial now perpetuates the memory of the shame of the Duke, where it is written: > In this place were put to the ground and salted the houses of Jos√© > Mascarenhas, stripped of the honours of Duque de Aveiro and others ... Put > to Justice as one of the leaders of the most barbarous and execrable > upheaval that ... was committed against the most royal and sacred person of > the Lord Joseph I. In this infamous land nothing may be built for all time. In the Portuguese colony of Brazil, the leader of the Inconfid√™ncia Mineira, Tiradentes, was sentenced to death and his house was \\"razed and salted, so that never again be built up on the floor, ... and even the floor will rise up a standard by which the memory is preserved (preserving) the infamy of this heinous offender ...\\" He suffered further indignities, being hanged and quartered, his body parts carried to various parts of the country where his fellow revolutionaries had met, and his children deprived of their property and honor. Legends An ancient legend recounts that Odysseus feigned madness by yoking a horse and an ox to his plow and sowing salt.The story does not appear in Homer, but was apparently mentioned in Sophocles' lost tragedy The Mad Ulysses: James George Frazer, ed., Apollodorus: The Library, II:176 footnote 2; Hyginus, Fabulae 95 mentions the mismatched animals but not the salt.

In the field of mergers and acquisitions, shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders, and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.For a description of a standard rights plan, see Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, The Share Purchase Rights Plan in Ronald J. Gilson & Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions (2d ed. Supp. 1999) at 10-18. The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an \\"option\\" or a \\"warrant\\" attached to existing shares, and only be revoked at the discretion of the board. History The poison pill was invented by mergers and acquisitions lawyer Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in 1982, as a response to tender-based hostile takeovers.Harvard Business School, Case Study 9-496-037, page 5 Poison pills became popular during the early 1980s in response to the wave of takeovers by corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn. The term \\"poison pill\\" derives its original meaning from a poison pill physically carried by various spies throughout history, a pill which was taken by the spies if they were discovered to eliminate the possibility of being interrogated by an enemy. It was reported in 2001 that since 1997, for every company with a poison pill which successfully resisted a hostile takeover, there were 20 companies with poison pills that accepted takeover offers.Poison Pill Popping - CFO Magazine - October 2001 Issue - CFO.com The trend since the early 2000s has been for shareholders to vote against poison pill authorization, since poison pills are designed to resist takeovers, whereas from the point of view of a shareholder, takeovers can be financially rewarding. Some have argued that poison pills are detrimental to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, Microsoft originally made an unsolicited bid for Yahoo!, but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO Jerry Yang threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, \\"They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place.\\" Yahoo has had a shareholders rights plan in place since 2001. Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from Carl Icahn. Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation. Poison pills saw a resurgence of popularity in 2020 as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. As stock prices plummeted due to the pandemic, various companies turned to shareholder rights plans to defend against opportunistic takeover offers. In March 2020, 10 U.S. companies adopted new poison pills, setting a new record. Overview In publicly held companies, \\"poison pills\\" refer to various methods to deter takeover bids. Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain control of a target company, either by soliciting proxies to get elected to the board or by acquiring a controlling block of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board. Once in control of the board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called \\"poison pills\\" because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well. Currently, the most common type of takeover defense is a shareholder rights plan. Because the board of directors of the company can redeem or otherwise eliminate a standard poison pill, it does not typically preclude a proxy fight or other takeover attempts not accompanied by an acquisition of a significant block of the company's stock. It can, however, prevent shareholders from entering into certain agreements that can assist in a proxy fight, such as an agreement to pay another shareholder's expenses. In combination with a staggered board of directors, however, a shareholder rights plan can be a defense.See The goal of a shareholder rights plan is to force a bidder to negotiate with the target's board and not directly with the shareholders. The effects are twofold:Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (6th ed.), Editions McGraw-Hill Ryerson, ¬ß23: Mergers and Acquisitions * It gives management time to find competing offers that maximize selling price. * Several studies indicate that companies with poison pills (shareholder rights plans) have received higher takeover premiums than companies without poison pills. This results in increased shareholder value. The theory is that an increase in the negotiating power of the target is reflected in higher acquisition premiums. Common types of poison pills = Preferred stock plan = The target issues a large number of new shares, often preferred shares, to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into a large number of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock. = Flip-in = A ‚Äúflip-in‚Äù permits shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. This provides investors with instantaneous profits. Using this type of poison pill also dilutes shares held by the acquiring company, making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult. = Flip-over = A ‚Äúflip-over‚Äù enables stockholders to purchase the acquirer's shares after the merger at a discounted rate. For example, a shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer, in subsequent mergers, at a two-for-one rate. = Back-end rights plan = Under this scenario, the target company re-phases all its employees' stock-option grants to ensure they immediately become vested if the company is taken over. Many employees can then exercise their options and then dump the stocks. With the release of the \\"golden handcuffs\\", many discontented employees may quit immediately after having cashed in their stock options. This poison pill is designed to create an exodus of talented employees, reducing a corporate value as a target. In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented human resources may result in a diluted or empty shell being left behind for the new owner. For instance, PeopleSoft guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival Oracle, and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses. While the acquisition ultimately prevailed, the hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion. = Voting plan = In a voting plan, a company will charter preferred stock with superior voting rights over that of common shareholders. If an unfriendly bidder acquired a substantial quantity of the target firm's voting common stock, it then still would not be able to exercise control over its purchase. For example, ASARCO established a voting plan in which 99% of the company's common stock would only harness 16.5% of the total voting power.Paul H. Malatesta (University of Washington) and Ralph A. Walking (Ohio State University), \\"Poison Pill Securities: Stockholder Wealth, Profitability, and Ownership Structure,\\" Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 20, January/March 1988, p. 355. In addition to these pills, a \\"dead-hand\\" provision allows only the directors who introduce the poison pill to remove it (for a set period after they have been replaced), thus potentially delaying a new board's decision to sell a company. Constraints and legal status The legality of poison pills had been unclear when they were first put to use in the early 1980s. However, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld poison pills as a valid instrument of takeover defense in its 1985 decision in Moran v. Household International, Inc. However, many jurisdictions other than the U.S. have held the poison pill strategy as illegal, or place restraints on their use. = Canada = In Canada, almost all shareholders rights plans are \\"chewable,\\" meaning they contain a permitted bid concept such that a bidder who is willing to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event. Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned. Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company. However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a white knight can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of Falconbridge Ltd. which at the time was the subject of a friendly bid from Inco and a hostile bid from Xstrata plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge. Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the Ontario Securities Commission ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, poison pills are not allowed under the Takeover Panel rules. The rights of public shareholders are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime. One disadvantage of the Panel's prohibition of poison pills is that it allows bidding wars to be won by hostile bidders who buy shares of their target in the marketplace during \\"raids\\". Raids have helped bidders win targets such as BAA plc and AWG plc when other bidders were considering emerging at higher prices. If these companies had poison pills, they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The London Stock Exchange itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the NASDAQ. The LSE's ultimate fate is currently up in the air, but NASDAQ's stake is sufficiently large that it is essentially impossible for a third party bidder to make a successful offer to acquire the LSE. Takeover law is still evolving in continental Europe, as individual countries slowly fall in line with requirements mandated by the European Commission. Stakebuilding is commonplace in many continental takeover battles such as Scania AB. Formal poison pills are quite rare in continental Europe, but national governments hold golden shares in many \\"strategic\\" companies such as telecom monopolies and energy companies. Governments have also served as \\"poison pills\\" by threatening potential suitors with negative regulatory developments if they pursue the takeover. Examples of this include Spain's adoption of new rules for the ownership of energy companies after E.ON of Germany made a hostile bid for Endesa and France's threats to punish any potential acquiror of Groupe Danone. Other takeover defenses Poison pill is sometimes used more broadly to describe other types of takeover defenses that involve the target taking some action. Although the broad category of takeover defenses (more commonly known as \\"shark repellents\\") includes the traditional shareholder rights plan poison pill. Other anti-takeover protections include: *Limitations on the ability to call special meetings or take action by written consent. *Supermajority vote requirements to approve mergers. *Supermajority vote requirements to remove directors. *The target adds to its charter a provision which gives the current shareholders the right to sell their shares to the acquirer at an increased price (usually 100% above recent average share price), if the acquirer's share of the company reaches a critical limit (usually one third). This kind of poison pill cannot stop a determined acquirer, but ensures a high price for the company. * The target takes on large debts in an effort to make the debt load too high to be attractive‚Äîthe acquirer would eventually have to pay the debts. * The company buys a number of smaller companies using a stock swap, diluting the value of the target's stock. * Classified boards with staggered elections for the board of directors. For example, if a company had nine directors, then three directors would be up for re-election each year, with a three-year term. This would present a potential acquirer with the position of having a hostile board for at least a year after the first election. In some companies, certain percentages of the board (33%) may be enough to block key decisions (such as a full merger agreement or major asset sale), so an acquirer may not be able to close an acquisition for years after having purchased a majority of the target's stock. As of December 31, 2008, 47.05% of the companies in the S&P; Super 1500 had a classified board. As of March 31, 2020, 27.1% of the companies in the S&P; Super 1500 had a classified board.http://www.dealpointdata.com Shareholder input An increasing number of companies are giving shareholders a say on poison pills. As of June 15, 2009, 21 companies that had adopted or extended a poison pill had publicly disclosed they plan to put the poison pill to a shareholder vote within a year. That was up from 2008's full year total of 18, and was the largest number ever reported since the early 1980s, when the pill was invented.

It is the county seat of Rio Arriba County. Tierra Amarilla is Spanish for \\"Yellow Earth\\". The name refers to clay deposits found in the Chama River Valley and used by Native American peoples. Tewa and Navajo toponyms for the area also refer to the yellow clay. History There is evidence of 5000 years of habitation in the Chama River Valley including pueblo sites south of Abiquiu. The area served as a trade route for peoples in the present-day Four Corners region and the Rio Grande Valley. Navajos later used the valley as a staging area for raids on Spanish settlements along the Rio Grande. Written accounts of the Tierra Amarilla locality by pathfinding Spanish friars in 1776 described it as suitable for pastoral and agricultural use. The route taken by the friars from Santa Fe to California became the Spanish Trail. During the Californian Gold Rush the area became a staging point for westward fortune seekers. Tierra Amarilla Grant The Tierra Amarilla Grant was created in 1832 by the Mexican government for Manuel Martinez and settlers from Abiquiu. The land grant encompassed a more general area than the contemporary community known as Tierra Amarilla. The grant holders were unable to maintain a permanent settlement due to \\"raids by Utes, Navajos and Jicarilla Apaches\\" until early in the 1860s. In 1860 the United States Congress confirmed the land grant as a private grant, rather than a community grant, due to mistranslated and concealed documents. Although a land patent for the grant required the completion of a geographical survey before issuance, some of Manuel Martinez' heirs began to sell the land to Anglo speculators. In 1880 Thomas Catron sold some of the grant to the Denver and Rio Grande Railway for the construction of their San Juan line and a service center at Chama. By 1883 Catron had consolidated the deeds he held for the whole of the grant sans the original villages and their associated fields. In 1950, the descendants of the original grant holder's court petitions to reclaim communal land were rebuked. Rio Arriba's county seat In 1866 the United States Army established Camp Plummer just south of Los Ojos (established in 1860) to rein in already decreased Native American activity on the grant. The military encampment was deserted in 1869. Las Nutrias, the site of the contemporary community, was founded nearby c.1862. The first post office in Las Nutrias was established in 1866 and bore the name Tierra Amarilla, as did the present one which was established in 1870 after an approximately two-year absence. In 1877 a U.S. Army lieutenant described the village as \\"the center of the Mexican population of northwestern New Mexico\\". The territorial legislature located Rio Arriba's county seat in Las Nutrias and renamed the village in 1880. The Denver and Rio Grande Railway's 1881 arrival at Chama, about ten miles to the north, had profound effects on the development of the region by bringing the area out of economic and cultural isolation. When Tierra Amarilla was designated as the county seat the villagers set about building a courthouse. This structure was demolished to make way for the present one, which was built in 1917 and gained notoriety fifty years later when it was the location of a gunfight between land rights activists and authorities. The neoclassical design by Isaac Rapp is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Courthouse raid The Alianza Federal de Mercedes, led by Reies Tijerina, raided the Rio Arriba County Courthouse in 1967. Attempting to make a citizen's arrest of the district attorney \\"to bring attention to the unscrupulous means by which government and Anglo settlers had usurped Hispanic land grant properties\\", an armed struggle in the courthouse ensued resulting in Tijerina and his group fleeing to the south with two prisoners as hostages. Eulogio Salazar, a prison guard, was shot and Daniel Rivera, a sheriff's deputy, was badly injured. The National Guard, FBI and New Mexico State Police successfully pursued Tijerina, who was sentenced to less than three years. Geography The Brazos Cliffs are a prominent nearby landmark and attraction. Also nearby are the artificial Heron Lake and El Vado Lake. Tierra Amarillas' Elevation is 7,524 feet above sea level. Layout The settlement is situated in a cluster of villages along United States Route 84 and the Chama River. The layout of the villages, including the one that became Tierra Amarilla, do not follow the urban planning principles of the Laws of the Indies.  Climate  Tierra Amarilla has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with very cold, snowy, though generally sunny winters, and summers featuring very warm to hot afternoons and cold to cool mornings. During the winter, mornings are frigid, with as many as 26.7 falling to or below , although maxima top freezing on all but nineteen afternoons during an average winter. The coldest temperature has been on January 6, 1971. Snowfall is much heavier than in more populated parts of New Mexico as Tierra Amarilla is located on a western slope rather than in a valley: the annual average is with a maximum of in January 1997 and a maximum annual total of between July 1996 and June 1997. The maximum snow depth has been on 30 November 1983. The spring season sees the sunniest weather of all and steadily warming temperatures, although over the year as a whole 224.9 mornings fall to or below freezing, with four freezes to be expected as late as June. The summer, although seeing diurnal temperature ranges of over , is the wettest period due to frequent monsoonal thunderstorms. The wettest months have been September 1927 and August 1967 which each saw of precipitation, the wettest calendar year 1986 with , and the driest 1956 with .

In the UK, the term refers to the acquisition of a public company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange, in contrast to the acquisition of a private company. Management of the target company may or may not agree with a proposed takeover, and this has resulted in the following takeover classifications: friendly, hostile, reverse or back-flip. Financing a takeover often involves loans or bond issues which may include junk bonds as well as a simple cash offers. It can also include shares in the new company.  Types   Friendly  A friendly takeover is an acquisition which is approved by the management of the target company. Before a bidder makes an offer for another company, it usually first informs the company's board of directors. In an ideal world, if the board feels that accepting the offer serves the shareholders better than rejecting it, it recommends the offer be accepted by the shareholders. In a private company, because the shareholders and the board are usually the same people or closely connected with one another, private acquisitions are usually friendly. If the shareholders agree to sell the company, then the board is usually of the same mind or sufficiently under the orders of the equity shareholders to cooperate with the bidder. This point is not relevant to the UK concept of takeovers, which always involve the acquisition of a public company.  Hostile  A hostile takeover allows a bidder to take over a target company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover. A takeover is considered hostile if the target company's board rejects the offer, and if the bidder continues to pursue it, or the bidder makes the offer directly after having announced its firm intention to make an offer. Development of the hostile tender is attributed to Louis Wolfson. A hostile takeover can be conducted in several ways. A tender offer can be made where the acquiring company makes a public offer at a fixed price above the current market price. An acquiring company can also engage in a proxy fight, whereby it tries to persuade enough shareholders, usually a simple majority, to replace the management with a new one which will approve the takeover. Another method involves quietly purchasing enough stock on the open market, known as a creeping tender offer, to effect a change in management. In all of these ways, management resists the acquisition, but it is carried out anyway. In the United States, a common defense tactic against hostile takeovers is to use section 16 of the Clayton Act to seek an injunction, arguing that section 7 of the act would be violated if the offeror acquired the target's stock. The main consequence of a bid being considered hostile is practical rather than legal. If the board of the target cooperates, the bidder can conduct extensive due diligence into the affairs of the target company, providing the bidder with a comprehensive analysis of the target company's finances. In contrast, a hostile bidder will only have more limited, publicly available information about the target company available, rendering the bidder vulnerable to hidden risks regarding the target company's finances. Since takeovers often require loans provided by banks in order to service the offer, banks are often less willing to back a hostile bidder because of the relative lack of target information which is available to them. Under Delaware law, boards must engage in defensive actions that are proportional to the hostile bidder's threat to the target company. A well-known example of an extremely hostile takeover was Oracle's bid to acquire PeopleSoft.Oracle's Hostile Takeover of People Soft (A) - Harvard Business Review As of 2018, about 1,788 hostile takeovers with a total value of US$28.86B have been announced.  Reverse  A reverse takeover is a type of takeover where a public company acquires a private company. This is usually done at the instigation of the private company, the purpose being for the private company to effectively float itself while avoiding some of the expense and time involved in a conventional IPO. However, in the UK under AIM rules, a reverse takeover is an acquisition or acquisitions in a twelve-month period which for an AIM company would: * exceed 100% in any of the class tests; or * result in a fundamental change in its business, board or voting control; or * in the case of an investing company, depart substantially from the investing strategy stated in its admission document or, where no admission document was produced on admission, depart substantially from the investing strategy stated in its pre-admission announcement or, depart substantially from the investing strategy. An individual or organization, sometimes known as a corporate raider, can purchase a large fraction of the company's stock and, in doing so, get enough votes to replace the board of directors and the CEO. With a new agreeable management team, the stock is, potentially, a much more attractive investment, which might result in a price rise and a profit for the corporate raider and the other shareholders. A well-known example of a reverse takeover in the United Kingdom was Darwen Group's 2008 takeover of Optare plc. This was also an example of a back-flip takeover (see below) as Darwen was rebranded to the more well-known Optare name.  Backflip  A backflip takeover is any sort of takeover in which the acquiring company turns itself into a subsidiary of the purchased company. This type of takeover can occur when a larger but less well-known company purchases a struggling company with a very well-known brand. Examples include: * The Texas Air Corporation takeover of Continental Airlines but taking the Continental name as it was better known. * The SBC takeover of the ailing AT&T; and subsequent rename to AT&T.; * Westinghouse's 1995 purchase of CBS and 1997 renaming to CBS Corporation, with Westinghouse becoming a brand name owned by the company. * NationsBank's takeover of the Bank of America, but adopting Bank of America's name. * Norwest purchased Wells Fargo but kept the latter due to its name recognition and historical legacy in the American West. * Interceptor Entertainment's acquisition of 3D Realms, but kept the name 3D Realms. * Nordic Games buying THQ assets and trademark and renaming itself to THQ Nordic. * Infogrames Entertainment, SA becoming Atari SA. * The Avago Technologies takeover of Broadcom Corporation and subsequent rename to Broadcom Inc..  Financing   Funding  Often a company acquiring another pays a specified amount for it. This money can be raised in a number of ways. Although the company may have sufficient funds available in its account, remitting payment entirely from the acquiring company's cash on hand is unusual. More often, it will be borrowed from a bank, or raised by an issue of bonds. Acquisitions financed through debt are known as leveraged buyouts, and the debt will often be moved down onto the balance sheet of the acquired company. The acquired company then has to pay back the debt. This is a technique often used by private equity companies. The debt ratio of financing can go as high as 80% in some cases. In such a case, the acquiring company would only need to raise 20% of the purchase price.  Loan note alternatives  Cash offers for public companies often include a \\"loan note alternative\\" that allows shareholders to take a part or all of their consideration in loan notes rather than cash. This is done primarily to make the offer more attractive in terms of taxation. A conversion of shares into cash is counted as a disposal that triggers a payment of capital gains tax, whereas if the shares are converted into other securities, such as loan notes, the tax is rolled over.  All share deals  A takeover, particularly a reverse takeover, may be financed by an all share deal. The bidder does not pay money, but instead issues new shares in itself to the shareholders of the company being acquired. In a reverse takeover the shareholders of the company being acquired end up with a majority of the shares in, and so control of, the company making the bid. The company has managerial rights.  All-cash deals  If a takeover of a company consists of simply an offer of an amount of money per share, (as opposed to all or part of the payment being in shares or loan notes) then this is an all-cash deal. This does not define how the purchasing company sources the cash- that can be from existing cash resources; loans; or a separate issue of shares.  Mechanics   In the United Kingdom  Takeovers in the UK (meaning acquisitions of public companies only) are governed by the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, also known as the 'City Code' or 'Takeover Code'. The rules for a takeover can be found in what is primarily known as 'The Blue Book'. The Code used to be a non-statutory set of rules that was controlled by city institutions on a theoretically voluntary basis. However, as a breach of the Code brought such reputational damage and the possibility of exclusion from city services run by those institutions, it was regarded as binding. In 2006, the Code was put onto a statutory footing as part of the UK's compliance with the European Takeover Directive (2004/25/EC). The Code requires that all shareholders in a company should be treated equally. It regulates when and what information companies must and cannot release publicly in relation to the bid, sets timetables for certain aspects of the bid, and sets minimum bid levels following a previous purchase of shares. In particular: * a shareholder must make an offer when its shareholding, including that of parties acting in concert (a \\"concert party\\"), reaches 30% of the target; * information relating to the bid must not be released except by announcements regulated by the Code; * the bidder must make an announcement if rumour or speculation have affected a company's share price; * the level of the offer must not be less than any price paid by the bidder in the twelve months before the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer; * if shares are bought during the offer period at a price higher than the offer price, the offer must be increased to that price; The Rules Governing the Substantial Acquisition of Shares, which used to accompany the Code and which regulated the announcement of certain levels of shareholdings, have now been abolished, though similar provisions still exist in the Companies Act 1985.  Strategies  There are a variety of reasons why an acquiring company may wish to purchase another company. Some takeovers are opportunistic ‚Äì the target company may simply be very reasonably priced for one reason or another and the acquiring company may decide that in the long run, it will end up making money by purchasing the target company. The large holding company Berkshire Hathaway has profited well over time by purchasing many companies opportunistically in this manner. Other takeovers are strategic in that they are thought to have secondary effects beyond the simple effect of the profitability of the target company being added to the acquiring company's profitability. For example, an acquiring company may decide to purchase a company that is profitable and has good distribution capabilities in new areas which the acquiring company can use for its own products as well. A target company might be attractive because it allows the acquiring company to enter a new market without having to take on the risk, time and expense of starting a new division. An acquiring company could decide to take over a competitor not only because the competitor is profitable, but in order to eliminate competition in its field and make it easier, in the long term, to raise prices. Also a takeover could fulfill the belief that the combined company can be more profitable than the two companies would be separately due to a reduction of redundant functions. Agency problems Takeovers may also benefit from principal‚Äìagent problems associated with top executive compensation. For example, it is fairly easy for a top executive to reduce the price of his/her company's stock ‚Äì due to information asymmetry. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in off-balance-sheet transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (i.e. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce the company's stock price. (This is again due to information asymmetries since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to window dress their company's earnings forecasts.) There are typically very few legal risks to being 'too conservative' in one's accounting and earnings estimates. A reduced share price makes a company an easier takeover target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) ‚Äì at a dramatically lower price ‚Äì the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce the company's stock price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a golden handshake for presiding over the fire sale that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work. (This is nevertheless an excellent bargain for the takeover artist, who will tend to benefit from developing a reputation of being very generous to parting top executives.) This is just one example of some of the principal‚Äìagent / perverse incentive issues involved with takeovers. Similar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes privatization. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis. This perception can reduce the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser) and make non-profits and governments more likely to sell. It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets.  Pros and cons  While pros and cons of a takeover differ from case to case, there are a few recurring ones worth mentioning. Pros: # Increase in sales/revenues (e.g. Procter & Gamble takeover of Gillette) # Venture into new businesses and markets # Profitability of target company # Increase market share # Decreased competition (from the perspective of the acquiring company) # Reduction of overcapacity in the industry # Enlarge brand portfolio (e.g. L'Or√©al's takeover of Body Shop) # Increase in economies of scale # Increased efficiency as a result of corporate synergies/redundancies (jobs with overlapping responsibilities can be eliminated, decreasing operating costs) # Expand strategic distribution network Cons: # Goodwill, often paid in excess for the acquisition # Culture clashes within the two companies causes employees to be less-efficient or despondent # Reduced competition and choice for consumers in oligopoly markets (Bad for consumers, although this is good for the companies involved in the takeover) # Likelihood of job cuts # Cultural integration/conflict with new management # Hidden liabilities of target entity # The monetary cost to the company # Lack of motivation for employees in the company being bought # Domination of a subsidiary by the parent company, which may result in piercing the corporate veil Takeovers also tend to substitute debt for equity. In a sense, any government tax policy of allowing for deduction of interest expenses but not of dividends, has essentially provided a substantial subsidy to takeovers. It can punish more- conservative or prudent management that does not allow their companies to leverage themselves into a high-risk position. High leverage will lead to high profits if circumstances go well but can lead to catastrophic failure if they do not. This can create substantial negative externalities for governments, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders.  Occurrence  Corporate takeovers occur frequently in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Spain. They happen only occasionally in Italy because larger shareholders (typically controlling families) often have special board voting privileges designed to keep them in control. They do not happen often in Germany because of the dual board structure, nor in Japan because companies have interlocking sets of ownerships known as keiretsu, nor in the People's Republic of China because the state owned majority owns most publicly listed companies.

In business, economics or investment, market liquidity is a market's feature whereby an individual or firm can quickly purchase or sell an asset without causing a drastic change in the asset's price. Liquidity involves the trade-off between the price at which an asset can be sold, and how quickly it can be sold. In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: one can sell quickly without having to accept a significantly lower price. In a relatively illiquid market, an asset must be discounted in order to sell quickly. Money, or cash, is the most liquid asset, because it can be \\"sold\\" for goods and services instantly with no loss of value. There is no wait for a suitable buyer of the cash. There is no trade- off between speed and value. It can be used immediately to perform economic actions like buying, selling, or paying debt, meeting immediate wants and needs. In an alternative definition, liquidity can mean the amount of cash and cash equivalents. If a business has moderate liquidity, it has a moderate amount of very liquid assets. If a business has sufficient liquidity, it has a sufficient amount of very liquid assets and the ability to meet its payment obligations. An act of exchanging a less liquid asset for a more liquid asset is called liquidation. Often liquidation means selling the less liquid asset for cash. An asset's liquidity can vary due to circumstances. An asset can be easier to sell in one location than another, or at different times of the year. The liquidity of a product can be measured as how often it is bought and sold. Liquidity is defined formally in many accounting regimes and has in recent years been more strictly defined. For instance, the US Federal Reserve applied quantitative liquidity requirements based on Basel III liquidity rules in fiscal 2012.Wyatt, Edward (20 December 2011) \\"Fed Proposes New Capital Rules for Banks\\" The New York Times Bank directors are required to know of, and approve, major liquidity risks personally. Other rules require diversifying counterparty risk and portfolio stress testing against extreme scenarios, which tend to identify unusual market liquidity conditions and avoid investments that are particularly vulnerable to sudden liquidity shifts. Overview This old church building for sale in Cheshire, England, has relatively low liquidity. It could be sold in a matter of days at a low price, but it could take several years to find a buyer who is willing to pay a reasonable price. A liquid asset has some or all of the following features: It can be sold rapidly, with minimal loss of value, anytime within market hours. The essential characteristic of a liquid market is that there are always ready and willing buyers and sellers. It is similar to, but distinct from, market depth, which relates to the trade-off between quantity being sold and the price it can be sold for, rather than the liquidity trade-off between speed of sale and the price it can be sold for. A market may be considered both deep and liquid if there are ready and willing buyers and sellers in large quantities. An illiquid asset is an asset which is not readily salable (without a drastic price reduction, and sometimes not at any price) due to uncertainty about its value or the lack of a market in which it is regularly traded. The mortgage-related assets which resulted in the subprime mortgage crisis are examples of illiquid assets, as their value was not readily determinable despite being secured by real property. Before the crisis, they had moderate liquidity because it was believed that their value was generally known. Speculators and market makers are key contributors to the liquidity of a market or asset. Speculators are individuals or institutions that seek to profit from anticipated increases or decreases in a particular market price. Market makers seek to profit by charging for the immediacy of execution: either implicitly by earning a bid/ask spread or explicitly by charging execution commissions. By doing this, they provide the capital needed to facilitate the liquidity. The risk of illiquidity does not apply only to individual investments: whole portfolios are subject to market risk. Financial institutions and asset managers that oversee portfolios are subject to what is called \\"structural\\" and \\"contingent\\" liquidity risk. Structural liquidity risk, sometimes called funding liquidity risk, is the risk associated with funding asset portfolios in the normal course of business. Contingent liquidity risk is the risk associated with finding additional funds or replacing maturing liabilities under potential, future stressed market conditions. When a central bank tries to influence the liquidity (supply) of money, this process is known as open market operations. Effect on asset values The market liquidity of assets affects their prices and expected returns. Theory and empirical evidence suggests that investors require higher return on assets with lower market liquidity to compensate them for the higher cost of trading these assets.Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson, \\"Asset Pricing and the Bid-Ask Spread.\\" Journal of Financial Economics 17, 1986. That is, for an asset with given cash flow, the higher its market liquidity, the higher its price and the lower is its expected return. In addition, risk-averse investors require higher expected return if the asset's market-liquidity risk is greater.Viral Acharya and Lasse Heje Pedersen, \\"Asset pricing with liquidity risk.\\" Journal of Financial Economics 77, 2005. This risk involves the exposure of the asset return to shocks in overall market liquidity, the exposure of the asset's own liquidity to shocks in market liquidity and the effect of market return on the asset's own liquidity. Here too, the higher the liquidity risk, the higher the expected return on the asset or the lower is its price.See a review in Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen, Market Liquidity, Cambridge University Press, 2013. http://www.cambridge.org/bus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521139656 One example of this is a comparison of assets with and without a liquid secondary market. The liquidity discount is the reduced promised yield or expected return for such assets, like the difference between newly issued U.S. Treasury bonds compared to off the run treasuries with the same term to maturity. Initial buyers know that other investors are less willing to buy off-the-run treasuries, so the newly issued bonds have a higher price (and hence lower yield). Futures In the futures markets, there is no assurance that a liquid market may exist for offsetting a commodity contract at all times. Some future contracts and specific delivery months tend to have increasingly more trading activity and have higher liquidity than others. The most useful indicators of liquidity for these contracts are the trading volume and open interest. There is also dark liquidity, referring to transactions that occur off-exchange and are therefore not visible to investors until after the transaction is complete. It does not contribute to public price discovery. Banking In banking, liquidity is the ability to meet obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. Managing liquidity is a daily process requiring bankers to monitor and project cash flows to ensure adequate liquidity is maintained. Maintaining a balance between short-term assets and short-term liabilities is critical. For an individual bank, clients' deposits are its primary liabilities (in the sense that the bank is meant to give back all client deposits on demand), whereas reserves and loans are its primary assets (in the sense that these loans are owed to the bank, not by the bank). The investment portfolio represents a smaller portion of assets, and serves as the primary source of liquidity. Investment securities can be liquidated to satisfy deposit withdrawals and increased loan demand. Banks have several additional options for generating liquidity, such as selling loans, borrowing from other banks, borrowing from a central bank, such as the US Federal Reserve bank, and raising additional capital. In a worst-case scenario, depositors may demand their funds when the bank is unable to generate adequate cash without incurring substantial financial losses. In severe cases, this may result in a bank run. Most banks are subject to legally mandated requirements intended to help avoid a liquidity crisis. Banks can generally maintain as much liquidity as desired because bank deposits are insured by governments in most developed countries. A lack of liquidity can be remedied by raising deposit rates and effectively marketing deposit products. However, an important measure of a bank's value and success is the cost of liquidity. A bank can attract significant liquid funds. Lower costs generate stronger profits, more stability, and more confidence among depositors, investors, and regulators. Stock market In the market, liquidity has a slightly different meaning. The market for a stock is said to be liquid if the shares can be rapidly sold and the act of selling has little impact on the stock's price. Generally, this translates to where the shares are traded and the level of interest that investors have in the company. Another way to judge liquidity in a company's stock is to look at the bid/ask spread. For liquid stocks, such as Microsoft or General Electric, the spread is often just a few pennies - much less than 1% of the price. For illiquid stocks, the spread can be much larger, amounting to a few percent of the trading price. Liquidity positively impacts the stock market. When stock prices rise, it is said to be due to a confluence of extraordinarily high levels of liquidity on household and business balance sheets, combined with a simultaneous normalization of liquidity preferences. On the margin, this drives a demand for equity investments. Proxies One way to calculate the liquidity of the banking system of a country is to divide liquid assets by short term liabilities.

Some of these species have grown as cereals for human consumption and some in pastures for animals. One species, Sorghum bicolor, was originally domesticated in Africa and has since spread throughout the globe. Seventeen of the 25 species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized in pasture lands. Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane). Cultivation and uses One species, Sorghum bicolor, native to Africa with many cultivated forms now, is an important crop worldwide, used for food (as grain and in sorghum syrup or \\"sorghum molasses\\"), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels. Most varieties are drought- and heat- tolerant, and nitrogen-efficient, and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people. These varieties form important components of forage in many tropical regions. S. bicolor is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth-most important cereal crop grown in the world. In the early stages of the plants' growth, some species of sorghum can contain levels of hydrogen cyanide, hordenine, and nitrates which are lethal to grazing animals. When stressed by drought or heat, plants can also contain toxic levels of cyanide and nitrates at later stages in growth.  Role in global economy  Global demand for sorghum increased dramatically between 2013 and 2015 when China began purchasing US sorghum crops to use as livestock feed as a substitute for domestically grown corn. China purchased around $1 billion worth of American sorghum per year until April 2018 when China imposed retaliatory duties on American sorghum as part of the trade war between the two countries. Species ;Accepted species ;Formerly included Many species once considered part of Sorghum, but now considered better suited to other genera include: Andropogon, Arthraxon, Bothriochloa, Chrysopogon, Cymbopogon, Danthoniopsis, Dichanthium, Diectomis, Diheteropogon, Exotheca, Hyparrhenia, Hyperthelia, Monocymbium, Parahyparrhenia, Pentameris, Pseudosorghum, Schizachyrium, and Sorghastrum.

History muslin Lakota tipi from the late 19th or early 20th century Siouan languages speakers may have originated in the lower Mississippi River region and then migrated to or originated in the Ohio Valley. They were agriculturalists and may have been part of the Mound Builder civilization during the 9th‚Äì12th centuries CE.Pritzker 329 Lakota legend and other sources state they originally lived near the Great Lakes: \\"The tribes of the Dakota before European contact in the 1600's lived in the region around Lake Superior. In this forest environment they lived by hunting, fishing and gathering wild rice. They also grew some corn but their locale was near the limit of where corn could be grown.\\" This may be conflation with the Algonquian groups typically in that region, though Siouan peoples probably migrated there later. \\"History of the Dakota Tribes\\"] In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Dakota-Lakota speakers lived in the upper Mississippi Region in present-day Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Dakotas. Conflicts with Anishnaabe and Cree peoples pushed the Lakota west onto the Great Plains in the mid- to late-17th century. Early Lakota history is recorded in their Winter counts (Lakota: wan√≠yetu w√≥wapi), pictorial calendars painted on hides or later recorded on paper. The Battiste Good winter count records Lakota history back to 900 CE, when White Buffalo Calf Woman gave the Lakota people the White Buffalo Calf Pipe.\\"Lakota Winter Counts.\\" Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Retrieved May 28, 2012. Around 1730, Cheyenne people introduced the Lakota to horses, called ≈°u≈ãkawaka≈ã (\\"dog [of] power/mystery/wonder\\"). After their adoption of horse culture, Lakota society centered on the buffalo hunt on horseback. The total population of the Sioux (Lakota, Santee, Yankton, and Yanktonai) was estimated at 28,000 by French explorers in 1660. The Lakota population was first estimated at 8,500 in 1805, growing steadily and reaching 16,110 in 1881. The Lakota were, thus, one of the few Native American tribes to increase in population in the 19th century.Bray, Kinglsy M.\\"Teton Sioux: Population History, 1655‚Äì1881.\\" Nebraska History.

After 1720, the Lakota branch of the Seven Council Fires split into two major sects, the Sa√¥ne who moved to the Lake Traverse area on the South Dakota‚ÄìNorth Dakota‚ÄìMinnesota border, and the Ogl√°la-Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu who occupied the James River valley. However, by about 1750 the Sa√¥ne had moved to the east bank of the Missouri River, followed 10 years later by the Ogl√°la and Brul√© (Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu). The large and powerful Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa villages had long prevented the Lakota from crossing the Missouri. However, the great smallpox epidemic of 1772‚Äì1780 destroyed three-quarters of these tribes. The Lakota crossed the river into the drier, short-grass prairies of the High Plains. These newcomers were the Sa√¥ne, well-mounted and increasingly confident, who spread out quickly. In 1765, a Sa√¥ne exploring and raiding party led by Chief Standing Bear discovered the Black Hills (the Paha Sapa), then the territory of the Cheyenne. Ten years later, the Ogl√°la and Brul√© also crossed the river. In 1776, the Lakota defeated the Cheyenne, who had earlier taken the region from the Kiowa. The Cheyenne then moved west to the Powder River country, and the Lakota made the Black Hills their home. Indian peace commissioners in council with the Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho, Fort Laramie, Wyoming Initial United States contact with the Lakota during the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804‚Äì1806 was marked by a standoff. Lakota bands refused to allow the explorers to continue upstream, and the expedition prepared for battle, which never came.The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, University of Nebraska. Some bands of Lakotas became the first Indians to help the United States Army in an Indian war west of the Missouri during the Arikara War in 1823.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 54.

Lakota 1851 treaty territory (Area 408, 516, 584, 597, 598 and 632) Nearly half a century later, after Fort Laramie had been built without permission on Lakota land, the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was negotiated to protect travelers on the Oregon Trail. The Cheyenne and Lakota had previously attacked emigrant parties in a competition for resources, and also because some settlers had encroached on their lands.Brown, Dee (1950) Bury My Heart at Wounded KneeMacmillan , The Fort Laramie Treaty acknowledged Lakota sovereignty over the Great Plains in exchange for free passage on the Oregon Trail for \\"as long as the river flows and the eagle flies\\". The United States government did not enforce the treaty restriction against unauthorized settlement. Lakota and other bands attacked settlers and even emigrant trains, causing public pressure on the U.S. Army to punish the hostiles. On September 3, 1855, 700 soldiers under American General William S. Harney avenged the Grattan Massacre by attacking a Lakota village in Nebraska, killing about 100 men, women, and children. A series of short \\"wars\\" followed, and in 1862‚Äì1864, as refugees from the \\"Dakota War of 1862\\" in Minnesota fled west to their allies in Montana and Dakota Territory. Increasing illegal settlement after the American Civil War caused war once again. The Black Hills were considered sacred by the Lakota, and they objected to mining. Between 1866 and 1868 the U.S. Army fought the Lakota and their allies along the Bozeman Trail over U.S. Forts built to protect miners traveling along the trail. Oglala Chief Red Cloud led his people to victory in Red Cloud's War. In 1868, the United States signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever. Four years later gold was discovered there, and prospectors descended on the area. The attacks on settlers and miners were met by military force conducted by army commanders such as Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer. General Philip Sheridan encouraged his troops to hunt and kill the buffalo as a means of \\"destroying the Indians' commissary.\\"Winona LaDuke, All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life, (Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 1999), 141. The allied Lakota and Arapaho bands and the unified Northern Cheyenne were involved in much of the warfare after 1860. They fought a successful delaying action against General George Crook's army at the Battle of the Rosebud, preventing Crook from locating and attacking their camp, and a week later defeated the U.S. 7th Cavalry in 1876 at the Battle of the Greasy Grass in the Crow Indian Reservation of 1868.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, pp. 998‚Äì1004. Custer attacked a camp of several tribes, much larger than he realized. Their combined forces, led by Chief Crazy Horse killed 258 soldiers, wiping out the entire Custer battalion in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and inflicting more than 50% casualties on the regiment. Their victory over the U.S. Army would not last, however. The U.S. Congress authorized funds to expand the army by 2,500 men. The reinforced US Army defeated the Lakota bands in a series of battles, finally ending the Great Sioux War in 1877. The Lakota were eventually confined onto reservations, prevented from hunting buffalo and forced to accept government food distribution. January 17, 1891: Young Man Afraid of His Horses at Camp of Oglala tribe of Lakota at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, 3 weeks after Wounded Knee Massacre, when 150 scattered as 153 Lakota Sioux and 25 U.S. soldiers died. Oglala Sioux tribal flag In 1877, some of the Lakota bands signed a treaty that ceded the Black Hills to the United States; however, the nature of this treaty and its passage were controversial. The number of Lakota leaders that actually backed the treaty is highly disputed. Low-intensity conflicts continued in the Black Hills. Fourteen years later, Sitting Bull was killed at Standing Rock reservation on December 15, 1890. The U.S. Army attacked Spotted Elk (aka Bigfoot), Mnicoujou band of Lakota at the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890, at Pine Ridge. Today, the Lakota are found mostly in the five reservations of western South Dakota: * Rosebud Indian Reservation, home of the Upper Siƒçh√°n«ßu or Brul√©. * Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Ogl√°la. * Lower Brule Indian Reservation, home of the Lower Siƒçha≈ã«ßu. * Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, home of several other of the seven Lakota bands, including the Mnik»ü√≥wo≈æu, It√°zipƒçho, Sih√°sapa, and O√≥henumpa. * Standing Rock Indian Reservation, home of the H√∫≈ãkpap»üa and to people from many other bands. Lakota also live on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation of northwestern North Dakota, and several small reserves in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Their ancestors fled to \\"Grandmother's [i.e. Queen Victoria's] Land\\" (Canada) during the Minnesota or Black Hills War. Large numbers of Lakota live in Rapid City and other towns in the Black Hills, and in metro Denver. Lakota elders joined the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) to seek protection and recognition for their cultural and land rights. Government United States LegallyThe Indian Reorganization Act and by treaty a semi-autonomous \\"nation\\" within the United States, the Lakota Sioux are represented locally by officials elected to councils for the several reservations and communities in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska. They are represented on the state and national level by the elected officials from the political districts of their respective states and Congressional Districts. Band or reservation members living both on and off the individual reservations are eligible to vote in periodic elections for that reservation. Each reservation has a unique local government style and election cycle based on its own constitutionOfficial Site of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Our Constitution & By-Laws or articles of incorporation. Most follow a multi-member tribal council model with a chairman or president elected directly by the voters. * The current President of the Oglala Sioux, the majority tribe of the Lakota located primarily on the Pine Ridge reservation, is Julian Bear Runner. * The President of the Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu Lakota at the Rosebud reservation is William Kindle. * The Chairman of the Standing Rock reservation, which includes peoples from several Lakota subgroups including the H√∫≈ãkpap»üa, is Mike Faith. * The Chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe at the Cheyenne River reservation, comprising the Mnik»ü√≥wo≈æu, It√°zipƒçho, Sih√° S√°pa, and O√≥henu≈ãpa bands of the Lakota, is Kevin Keckler. * The Chairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, which is home to the Lower Sicangu Lakota, is Boyd I. Gourneau. Tribal governments have significant leeway, as semi-autonomous political entities, in deviating from state law (e.g. Indian gaming). They are ultimately subject to supervisory oversight by the United States Congress and executive regulation through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The nature and legitimacy of those relationships continue to be a matter of dispute. Canada There are nine bands of Dakota and Lakota in Manitoba and southern Saskatchewan, with a total of 6,000 registered members. They are recognized as First Nations but are not considered \\"treaty Indians\\". As First Nations they receive rights and entitlements through the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada department. However, as they are not recognized as treaty Indians, they did not participate in the land settlement and natural resource revenues.Ottawa rejects claims by Dakota, Lakota First Nations, CBC News, August 1, 2007 The Dakota rejected a $60-million land- rights settlement in 2008.Dakota Nations reject $60.3 M settlement offer from Ottawa , The Brandon Sun, June 26, 2008 Independence movement Mildred \\"Midge\\" Wagner, a Lakota woman, singing at a pow wow in 2015 There have been numerous actions, occupations, and proposed independence movements, led by a variety of individuals and coalitions. In 1980, the Supreme Court decided in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians to award $122 million to eight bands of Sioux Indians as compensation for their Black Hills land claims. The Sioux have refused the money, because accepting the settlement would legally terminate their demands for return of the Black Hills. The money remains in a Bureau of Indian Affairs account, accruing compound interest. As of 2011, the account has grown to over $1 billion. In September 2007, the United Nations passed a non-binding Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand refused to sign.UBB Message ‚Äì ReaderRant On December 20, 2007, a small group of people led by American Indian Movement activist Russell Means, under the name Lakota Freedom Delegation, traveled to Washington D.C. to announce a withdrawal of the Lakota Sioux from all treaties with the United States government.\\"Descendants of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse break away from US\\" , Agence France-Presse news These activists had no standing under any elected tribal government, and Lakota tribal leaders issued public responses to the effect that, in the words of Rosebud Lakota tribal chairman Rodney Bordeaux, \\"We do not support what Means and his group are doing and they don't have any support from any tribal government I know of. They don't speak for us.\\"Lakota Sioux Have NOT Withdrawn From the US; in The Daily Kos; December 23, 2007; accessed March 28, 2016 Means then declared \\"The Republic of Lakotah\\" a sovereign nation with property rights over thousands of square miles in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana.Bill Harlan, \\"Lakota group secedes from U.S.\\" , Rapid City Journal, December 20, 2007.

Russell Means had previously run for president of the Oglala Sioux tribe and twice been defeated. Several tribal governments ‚Äì elected by the tribes themselves ‚Äì issued statements distancing themselves from the independence declaration, with some saying they were watching the independent movement closely. No elected tribal governments endorsed the declaration.  Current activism  The Lakota People made national news when NPR's \\"Lost Children, Shattered Families\\" investigative story aired.\\"Lost Children, Shattered Families\\" It exposed what many critics consider to be the \\"kidnapping\\" of Lakota children from their homes by the state of South Dakota's Department of Social Services (D.S.S.). Lakota activists such as Madonna Thunder Hawk and Chase Iron Eyes, along with the Lakota People‚Äôs Law Project, have alleged that Lakota grandmothers are illegally denied the right to foster their own grandchildren. They are currently working to redirect federal funding away from the state of South Dakota's D.S.S. to new tribal foster care programs. This would be an historic shift away from the state's traditional control over Lakota foster children. Another short film, Lakota in America, was produced by Square. The film features Genevieve Iron Lightning, a young Lakota dancer on the Cheyenne River Reservation, one of the poorest communities in the USA. Unemployment, addiction, alcoholism and suicide are all challenges for Lakota on the reservation. Ethnonyms The name Lakota comes from the Lakota autonym, Lakota \\"feeling affection, friendly, united, allied\\". The early French historic documents did not distinguish a separate Teton division, instead grouping them with other \\"Sioux of the West,\\" Santee and Yankton bands. The names Teton and Tetuwan come from the Lakota name th√≠t»üu≈ãwa≈ã, the meaning of which is obscure. This term was used to refer to the Lakota by non- Lakota Sioux groups. Other derivations include: ti tanka, Tintonyanyan, Titon, Tintonha, Thintohas, Tinthenha, Tinton, Thuntotas, Tintones, Tintoner, Tintinhos, Ten-ton-ha, Thinthonha, Tinthonha, Tentouha, Tintonwans, Tindaw, Tinthow, Atintons, Anthontans, Atentons, Atintans, Atrutons, Titoba, Tetongues, Teton Sioux, Teeton, Ti toan, Teetwawn, Teetwans, Ti-t‚Äô-wawn, Ti- twans, Tit‚Äôwan, Tetans, Tieton, and Teetonwan. Early French sources call the Lakota Sioux with an additional modifier, such as Sioux of the West, West Schious, Sioux des prairies, Sioux occidentaux, Sioux of the Meadows, Nadooessis of the Plains, Prairie Indians, Sioux of the Plain, Maskoutens- Nadouessians, Mascouteins Nadouessi, and Sioux nomades. Lakota Beaded Saddle Belt, made c. 1850 Today many of the tribes continue to officially call themselves Sioux. In the 19th and 20th centuries, this was the name which the US government applied to all Dakota/Lakota people. However, some tribes have formally or informally adopted traditional names: the Rosebud Sioux Tribe is also known as the Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu Oy√°te (Brul√© Nation), and the Oglala often use the name Ogl√°la Lak»ü√≥ta Oy√°te, rather than the English \\"Oglala Sioux Tribe\\" or OST. (The alternate English spelling of Ogallala is deprecated, even though it is closer to the correct pronunciation.) The Lakota have names for their own subdivisions. The Lakota also are Western of the three Sioux groups, occupying lands in both North and South Dakota. Reservations Akta Lakota Museum in Chamberlain, South Dakota Today, one half of all enrolled Sioux live off the Reservation.

Today, the Cheyenne people are split into two federally recognized Nations: the Southern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma, and the Northern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana. At the time of their first contact with the Europeans, the Cheyenne were living in the area of what is now Minnesota. At times they have been allied with the Lakota and Arapaho, and at other points enemies of the Lakota. In the early 18th century they migrated west across the Missouri River and into North and South Dakota, where they adopted the horse culture. Having settled the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Powder River Country of present-day Montana, they introduced the horse culture to Lakota bands about 1730. Allied with the Arapaho, the Cheyenne pushed the Kiowa to the Southern Plains. In turn, they were pushed west by the more numerous Lakota.Walker, James R. & DeMallie, Raymond J. \\"Lakota Society\\" 1992. The Cheyenne Nation or Ts√™h√©st√°no was at one time composed of ten bands that spread across the Great Plains from southern Colorado to the Black Hills in South Dakota. They fought their traditional enemies, the Crow and later (1856‚Äì79) the United States Army forces. In the mid-19th century, the bands began to split, with some bands choosing to remain near the Black Hills, while others chose to remain near the Platte Rivers of central Colorado. The Northern Cheyenne, known in Cheyenne either as Notameohm√©s√™hese, meaning \\"Northern Eaters\\" or simply as Ohm√©s√™hese meaning \\"Eaters\\", live in southeastern Montana on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Tribal enrollment figures, as of late 2014, indicate that there are approximately 10,840 members, of which about 4,939 reside on the reservation. Approximately 91% of the population are Native Americans (full or part race), with 72.8% identifying themselves as Cheyenne. Slightly more than one quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English. The Southern Cheyenne, known in Cheyenne as He√©v√¢hetaneo'o meaning \\"Roped People\\", together with the Southern Arapaho, form the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, in western Oklahoma. Their combined population is 12,130, . In 2003, approximately 8,000 of these identified themselves as Cheyenne, although with continuing intermarriage it has become increasingly difficult to separate the tribes. Cheyenne hide dress, ca. 1920, Gilcrease Museum Cheyenne beaded hide shirt, Woolaroc Cheyenne model tipi, buffalo hide, 1860 Name The Cheyenne Nation is composed of two tribes, the S√≥'taeo'o or S√≥'ta√©taneo'o (more commonly as Suhtai or Sutaio; singular: S√≥'ta√©tane) and the Ts√©ts√™h√©st√¢hese (more commonly as the Tsitsistas; singular: Ts√©ts√™h√©staestse), which translates to \\"those who are like this\\". These two tribes had always traveled together, becoming fully merged sometime after 1831, when they were still noted as having separate camps. The Suhtai were said to have originally had slightly different speech and customs from their traveling companions.Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, p. 2. The name \\"Cheyenne\\" may be derived from Lakota Sioux exonym for them, ≈†ah√≠yena (meaning \\"little ≈†ah√≠ya\\"). Though the identity of the ≈†ah√≠ya is not known, many Great Plains tribes assume it means Cree or some other people who spoke an Algonquian language related to Cree and Cheyenne. The Cheyenne word for Ojibwe is S√°hea'eo'o, a word that sounds similar to the Lakota word ≈†ah√≠ya. Another of the common etymologies for Cheyenne is \\"a bit like the [people of an] alien speech\\" (literally, \\"red-talker\\").Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 95 According to George Bird Grinnell, the Lakota had referred to themselves and fellow Siouan-language bands as \\"white talkers\\", and those of other language families, such as the Algonquian Cheyenne, as \\"red talkers\\" (≈†ah√≠yena). The etymology of the name Tsitsistas (technically Ts√©tsƒóh√©st»ßhese), which the Cheyenne call themselves, is uncertain. According to the Cheyenne dictionary, offered online by Chief Dull Knife College, there is no definitive consensus and various studies of the origins and the translation of the word have been suggested. Grinnell's record is typical; he states \\"They call themselves Tsistsistas [sic, Tsitsistas is the correct pronunciation], which the books commonly give as meaning \\"people\\". It most likely means related to one another, similarly bred, like us, our people, or us.Chief Dull Knife College, Cheyenne Dictionary \\"Ts√©-tsƒóh√©st»ßhese\\" The term for the Cheyenne homeland is Tsiihistano.\\" Language The Cheyenne of Montana and Oklahoma speak the Cheyenne language, known as Ts√™h√©sen√™stsest√¥tse (common spelling: Tsisinstsistots). Approximately 800 people speak Cheyenne in Oklahoma. There are only a handful of vocabulary differences between the two locations. The Cheyenne alphabet contains 14 letters. The Cheyenne language is one of the larger Algonquian-language group. Formerly, the S√≥'taeo'o (S√≥'ta√©taneo'o) or Suhtai (Sutaio) bands of Southern and Northern Cheyenne spoke S√≥'ta√©ka'ƒô¬ök√≥ne or S√≥'taenƒôstsest√¥tse, a language so close to Ts√™h√©sen√™stsest√¥tse (Cheyenne language), that it is sometimes termed a Cheyenne dialect. History Cheyenne woman photograph by Edward S. Curtis, 1930 The earliest known written historical record of the Cheyenne comes from the mid-17th century, when a group of Cheyenne visited the French Fort Crevecoeur, near present-day Peoria, Illinois. The Cheyenne at this time lived between the Mississippi River and Mille Lacs Lake. Their economy was based on the collection of wild rice and hunting, especially of bison, which lived in the prairies 70‚Äì80 miles west of the Cheyenne villages.Moore, John H. The Cheyenne. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Co., 1999, pp. 15‚Äì16 According to tribal history, during the 17th century, the Cheyenne had been driven by the Assiniboine (H√≥heeheo'o ‚Äì \\"wrapped ones or swaddled\\", adaptive from the Lakota/Dakota word H√≥he, meaning \\"rebels\\") from the Great Lakes region to present-day Minnesota and North Dakota, where they established villages. The most prominent of the ancient Cheyenne villages is Biesterfeldt Village, in eastern North Dakota along the Sheyenne River. The tribal history also relates that they first reached the Missouri River in 1676.Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, p. 1‚Äì8. A more recent analysis of early records posits that at least some of the Cheyenne remained in the Mille Lac region of Minnesota until about 1765, when the Ojibwe defeated the Lakota with firearms ‚Äî pushing the Cheyenne, in turn, to the Minnesota River, where they were reported in 1766.Moore, John H. The Cheyenne. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Co., 1999, p. 18 On the Missouri River, the Cheyenne came into contact with the neighboring Mandan, Hidatsa (Ts√©- he≈°e'√©m√¢he√≥nese, \\"people who have soil houses\\"), and Arikara people (√ìnoneo'o), and they adopted many of their cultural characteristics. They were first of the later Plains tribes into the Black Hills and Powder River Country. About 1730, they introduced the horse to Lakota bands (Ho'√≥homo'eo'o ‚Äì \\"the invited ones (to Cheyenne lands i.e. the Black Hills)\\"). Conflict with migrating Lakota and Ojibwe people forced the Cheyenne further west, and they, in turn, pushed the Kiowa to the south. By 1776, the Lakota had overwhelmed the Cheyenne and taken over much of their territory near the Black Hills. In 1804, Lewis and Clark visited a surviving Cheyenne village in what is now North Dakota. Such European explorers learned many different names for the Cheyenne, and did not realize how the different sections were forming a unified tribe. The Cheyenne Nation is descended from two related tribes, the Ts√©ts√™h√©st√¢hese / Tsitsistas (Cheyenne proper) and S√≥'taeo'o / S√≥'ta√©taneo'o (better known as Suhtai or Sutaio), the latter may have joined the Ts√©ts√™h√©st√¢hese in the early 18th century. Their oral history relays that both tribal peoples are characterized, and represented by two cultural heroes or prophets who received divine articles from their god Ma'heo'o (‚Ä≥Sacred Being, God‚Ä≥, commonly in English Maheo, Mahiu, this is a post-missionary term, formerly the plural Ma'heono was used), which the S√≥'taeo'o called He'emo (‚Ä≥Goddess, Female Sacred Being, God‚Ä≥, equivalent to Ma'heo'o in the Ts√©ts√™h√©st√¢hese dialect). The Ts√©ts√™h√©st√¢hese / Tsitsistas prophet Mots√©'e√≥eve (Sweet Medicine Standing, Sweet Root Standing, commonly called Sweet Medicine) had received the Maah√≥tse (in English known as Mahuts, a bundle of (Sacred) Arrows or the (Sacred) Arrows Bundle) at N√≥√°v√≥se (‚Ä≥medicine(sacred)-hill‚Ä≥, name for Bear Butte, northwest of Rapid City, South Dakota),Not to be confused with the Bear Butte, near Fort Meade, South Dakota, which was called N√°hk»Øh√©vose (\\"bear hill\\") which they carried when they waged tribal-level warHyde, George E.: Life of George Bent. Written From His Letters. Norman, 1987. Pp. 24 and 49.Grinnell, George Bird: \\"The Great Mysteries of the Cheyenne.\\" American Anthropologist.

He organized the structure of Cheyenne society, their military or war societies led by prominent warriors, their system of legal justice, and the Council of Forty-four peace chiefs, the latter was formed from four v√©hoo'o (chiefs or leaders) of the ten principal manaho (bands) and an additional four ‚Ä≥Old Man‚Ä≥ meeting to deliberate at regular tribal gatherings, centered around the Sun Dance. Sweet Medicine is the Cheyenne prophet who predicted the coming of the horse, cow, whiteman, etc. to the Cheyenne. He was named for mots√©'eon»Øtse (sweetgrass), one of the sacred plant medicines used by many Plains peoples in ceremonies. The Maah√≥tse (Sacred Arrows) are symbols of male power and the power of the √âsevone / H√≥hkƒóha'e (Sacred Buffalo Hat) is female. The Sacred Buffalo Hat and the Sacred Arrows together form the two great covenants of the Cheyenne Nation. Through these two bundles, Ma'heo'o assures continual life and blessings for the people. The S√≥'taeo'o prophet Tom»Øs√©vƒós√©he (\\"Erect Horns\\") had received the √âsevone (aka Is'siwun ‚Äì \\"Sacred (Buffalo) Hat Bundle\\") at Toh'nihvoos (‚Ä≥Stone Hammer Mountain‚Ä≥) near the Great Lakes in the present state of Minnesota. The √âsevone / H√≥hkƒóha'e (Sacred Buffalo Hat) is kept in the von»ßh√©ome (old term) or h√≥hkƒóha'√©ome (new term) (\\"Sacred Hat Lodge, Sacred Hat Tepee\\"). Erect Horns gave them the accompanying ceremonies and the Sun Dance. His vision convinced the tribe to abandon their earlier sedentary agricultural traditions to adopt nomadic Plains horse culture. They replaced their earth lodges with portable tipis and switched their diet from fish and agricultural produce, to mainly bison and wild fruits and vegetables. Their lands ranged from the upper Missouri River into what is now Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and South Dakota. The √âsevone / H√≥hkƒóha'e (\\"Sacred Buffalo Hat\\") is kept among the Northern Cheyenne and Northern S√≥'taeo'o. The Ts√©√°'en≈çv»ßhtse (‚Ä≥Sacred (Buffalo) Hat Keeper‚Ä≥ or ‚Ä≥Keeper of the Sacred (Buffalo) Hat‚Ä≥) must belong to the S√≥'taeo'o (Northern or Southern alike). In the 1870s tribal leaders became disenchanted with the keeper of the bundle demanded the keeper Broken Dish give up the bundle; he agreed but his wife did not and desecrated the Sacred Hat and its contents; a ceremonial pipe and a buffalo horn were lost. In 1908 a Cheyenne named Three Fingers gave the horn back to the Hat; the pipe came into possession of a Cheyenne named Burnt All Over who gave it to Hattie Goit of Poteau, Oklahoma who in 1911 gave the pipe to the Oklahoma Historical Society. In 1997 the Oklahoma Historal Society negotiated with the Northern Cheyenne to return the pipe to the tribal keeper of the Sacred Medicine Hat Bundle James Black Wolf.Reading Eagle November 26, 1997

(H√°ov»Øhn√≥v»ßhese or Nƒóstamen√≥oheo'o) were the ten principal bands that had the right to send four chief delegates representing them in the Council of Forty-Four. After the Masikota and Oo'k√≥hta'on√° bands had been almost wiped out through a cholera epidemic in 1849, the remaining Masikota joined the Dog Soldiers warrior society (Hotam√©taneo'o). They effectively became a separate band and in 1850 took over the position in the camp circle formerly occupied by the Masikota. The members often opposed policies of peace chiefs such as Black Kettle. Over time, the Dog Soldiers took a prominent leadership role in the wars against the whites. In 1867, most of the band were killed by United States Army forces in the Battle of Summit Springs. Due to an increasing division between the Dog Soldiers and the council chiefs with respect to policy towards the whites, the Dog Soldiers became separated from the other Cheyenne bands. They effectively became a third division of the Cheyenne people, between the Northern Cheyenne, who ranged north of the Platte River, and the Southern Cheyenne, who occupied the area north of the Arkansas River. Expansion on the Plains Portrait of Cheyenne chief Wolf-on-the-Hill by George Catlin, 1832. A band of Cheyenne visited Fort Pierre, South Dakota in 1832 where some were painted by Catlin during a westward expedition. After being pushed south and westward by the Lakota, the unified Cheyenne people began to create and expand a new territory of their own. Sometime around 1811 the Cheyenne made a formal alliance with the Arapaho people (Hetanevo'eo'o ‚Äì \\"People of the Sky\\", \\"Cloud People\\", because of their close interaction also known as H√©stanƒóheo'o ‚Äì \\"people, mankind, tribe of people\\"), which would remain strong throughout their history and into modern times. The alliance helped the Cheyenne expand their territory which stretched from southern Montana, through most of Wyoming, the eastern half of Colorado, far western Nebraska, and far western Kansas. As early as 1820, traders and explorers reported contact with Cheyenne at present-day Denver, Colorado and on the Arkansas River. They were probably hunting and trading in that area earlier. They may have migrated to the south for winter. The Hairy Rope band is reputed to have been the first band to move south, capturing wild horses as far south as the Cimarron River Valley.Berthrong, pp. 13‚Äì21 In response to the construction of Bent's Fort by Charles Bent, a friend of the Cheyenne who established a popular trading area for the Cheyenne, a large portion of the tribe moved further south and stayed around the area.Berthrong, pp. 24‚Äì26 The other part of the tribe continued to live along the headwaters of the North Platte and Yellowstone rivers. The groups became the Southern Cheyenne, known as S√≥won√≠ƒÉ (Southerners) and the Northern Cheyenne, known as O'm«ê's«ês (Eaters). The separation of the tribe was only a geographic one and the two divisions had regular and close contact. In the southern portion of their territory the Cheyenne and Arapaho warred with the allied Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache. Numerous battles were fought including a notable fight along the Washita River in 1836 with the Kiowa which resulted in the death of 48 Cheyenne warriors of the Bowstring society. In summer 1838, many Cheyenne and Arapaho attacked a camp of Kiowa and Comanche along Wolf Creek in Oklahoma resulting in heavy losses from both sides. Conflict with the Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache ended in 1840 when the tribes made an alliance with each other. The new alliance allowed the Cheyenne to enter the Llano Estacado in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and northeastern New Mexico to hunt bison and trade. Their expansion in the south and alliance with the Kiowa led to their first raid into Mexico in 1853. The raid ended in disaster with heavy resistance from Mexican lancers, resulting in all but three of the war party being killed. To the north the Cheyenne made a strong alliance with the Lakota Sioux, which allowed them to expand their territory into part of their former lands around the Black Hills. They managed to escape the smallpox epidemics, which swept across the plains from white settlements in 1837‚Äì39, by heading into the Rocky Mountains, but were greatly affected by the Cholera epidemic in 1849. Contact with Euro-Americans was mostly light, with most contact involving mountain men, traders, explorers, treaty makers, and painters. Enemies and warrior culture E.A Burbank, 1899.

Like many other plains Indian nations, the Cheyenne were a horse and warrior people who developed as skilled and powerful mounted warriors. A warrior was viewed by the people not as a maker of war but as a protector, provider, and leader. Warriors gained rank in Cheyenne society by performing and accumulating various acts of bravery in battle known as coups. The title of war chief could be earned by any warrior who performs enough of the specific coups required to become a war chief. Specific warrior societies developed among the Cheyenne as with other plains nations. Each society had selected leaders who would invite those that they saw worthy enough to their society lodge for initiation into the society. Often, societies would have minor rivalries; however, they might work together as a unit when warring with an enemy. Military societies played an important role in Cheyenne government. Society leaders were often in charge of organizing hunts and raids as well as ensuring proper discipline and the enforcement of laws within the nation.Greene 2004, p. 9. Each of the six distinct warrior societies of the Cheyenne would take turns assuming the leadership role within the nation.Hyde 1968, p. 336. The four original military societies of the Cheyenne were the Swift Fox Society, Elk Horn Scrapper or Crooked Lance Society, Shield Society, and the Bowstring Men Society. The fifth society is split between the Crazy Dog Society and the famous Dog Soldiers. The sixth society is the Contrary Warrior Society, most notable for riding backwards into battle as a sign of bravery.Chief Dull Knife College \\"Cheyenne Dictionary\\" 2007-09-05. Retrieved June 10, 2013 All six societies and their various branches exist among the Southern and Northern Cheyenne Nations in present times. Warriors used a combination of traditional weapons such as various types of war clubs, tomahawks, bows and arrows, and lances as well as non-traditional weapons such as revolvers, rifles, and shotguns acquired through raid and trade. The enemies of the Cheyenne included the Crow (√ìoetaneo'o ‚Äì \\"crow (bird) people\\"), Shoshone (S√≥sone'eo'o), Blackfeet (Mo'√¥ht√°v√™haht√°taneo'o, same literal meaning), Flathead (K»ßhkoests√©ataneo'o ‚Äì \\"flat-headed-people\\"), Nez Perce (Otaes√©taneo'o ‚Äì \\"pierced nose people\\"), Arikara, Gros Ventre (Hest√≥etaneo'o ‚Äì \\"beggars for meat\\", \\"spongers\\" or M√¥h√≥nooneo'o ‚Äì lit. \\"scouting all over ones\\"), Assiniboine, and Plains Cree (V√≥hkooh√©taneo'o ‚Äì \\"rabbit people\\") to the north and west of Cheyenne territory. By the help of the Medicine Arrows (the Mahuts), the Cheyenne tribe massacred a Crow camp in 1820.Hyde, George E.: Life of George Bent. Written From His Letters. Norman, 1987. Pp. 25‚Äì26. To the east of Cheyenne Territory they fought with the Sioux, Pawnee (Ho'n√©hetaneo'o ‚Äì \\"wolf people\\", possibly an adaptive from the Skiri/Skidi Pawnee or Wolf Pawnee), Ponca (On√©hao'o), Kaw (Oo'k√≥ht√¢x√©taneo'o ‚Äì \\"cut hair people\\"), Iowa, Ho-Chunk and Omaha (On√©hao'o). The Cheyenne lost the Medicine Arrows during an attack on a hunting camp of Pawnees around 1830.Dorsey, George A.: \\"How the Pawnee Captured the Cheyenne Medicine Arrows.\\" American Anthropologist, New Series. Vol. 5 (Oct. ‚Äì Dec. 1903), No. 4, pp. 644‚Äì658. South of Cheyenne territory they fought with the Kiowa (V√©tap√¢haet√≥'eo'o ‚Äì \\"greasy wood ones\\"), Comanche (≈†√©'≈°enovots√©taneo'o ‚Äì \\"snake people\\"), Ute (Mo'»Øht√°vƒóhetaneo'o ‚Äì \\"black (skinned) people\\"), Plains Apache (M»Øhts√©heonetaneo'o ‚Äì \\"occupied.comp- people\\"), Osage (Oo'k√≥ht√¢x√©taneo'o ‚Äì \\"cut hair people\\"), Wichita people, various Apache tribes and Navajo (Hotam√≥'keeho ‚Äì \\"Indians from out west\\"; collective name for tribes of the Southswest and Great Basin). Many of the enemies the Cheyenne fought were only encountered occasionally, such as on a long distance raid or hunt. Some of their enemies, particularly the Indian peoples of the eastern great plains such as the Pawnee and Osage would act as Indian Scouts for the US Army, providing valuable tracking skills and information regarding Cheyenne habits and fighting strategies to US soldiers. Some of their enemies such as the Lakota would later in their history become their strong allies, helping the Cheyenne fight against the United States Army during Red Cloud's War and the Great Sioux War of 1876. The Comanche, Kiowa and Plains Apache became allies of the Cheyenne towards the end of the Indian wars on the southern plains, fighting together during conflicts such as the Red River War. Relationship with the Arapaho The Cheyenne and Arapaho people formed an alliance around 1811 that helped them expand their territories and strengthen their presence on the plains. Like the Cheyenne, the Arapaho language is part of the Algonquian group, although the two languages are not mutually intelligible. The Arapaho remained strong allies with the Cheyenne and helped them fight alongside the Sioux during Red Cloud's War and the Great Sioux War of 1876, also known commonly as the Black Hills War. On the southern plains, the Arapaho and Cheyenne allied with the Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache to fight invading settlers and US soldiers. The Arapaho were present with the Cheyenne at the Sand Creek Massacre when a peaceful encampment of mostly women, children, and the elderly were attacked and massacred by US soldiers. Both major divisions of the Cheyenne, the Northern Cheyenne and Southern Cheyenne were allies to the Arapaho who like the Cheyenne are split into northern and southern divisions. The Southern Cheyenne and Southern Arapaho were assigned to the same reservation in Oklahoma Indian Territory and remained together as the federally recognized Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes after the reservation was opened to American settlement and into modern times. The Northern Arapaho were to be assigned a reservation of their own or share one with the Cheyenne however the government failed to provide them with either and placed them on the already established Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming with their former enemies the Shoshone. Treaty of 1825 In the summer of 1825, the tribe was visited on the upper Missouri by a US treaty commission consisting of General Henry Atkinson and Indian agent Benjamin O'Fallon, accompanied by a military escort of 476 men. General Atkinson and his fellow commissioner left Fort Atkinson on May 16, 1825. Ascending the Missouri, they negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with tribes of the upper Missouri, including the Arikara, the Cheyenne, the Crow, the Mandan, the Ponca, and several bands of the Sioux. At that time, the US had competition on the upper Missouri from British traders, who came south from Canada. The treaties acknowledged that the tribes lived within the United States, vowed perpetual friendship between the US and the tribes, and, recognizing the right of the United States to regulate trade, the tribes promised to deal only with licensed traders. The tribes agreed to forswear private retaliation for injuries, and to return stolen horses or other goods or compensate the owner. The commission's efforts to contact the Blackfoot and the Assiniboine were unsuccessful. During their return to Fort Atkinson at the Council Bluff in Nebraska, the commission had successful negotiations with the Ota, the Pawnee and the Omaha.Page 143, Francis Paul Prucha, American Indian treaties: the history of a political anomaly, University of California Press (March 15, 1997), trade paperback, 562 pages Effects of the Emigrant Trail Increased traffic of emigrants along the related Oregon, Mormon and California trails, beginning in the early 1840s, heightened competition with Native Americans for scarce resources of water and game in arid areas. With resource depletion along the trails, the Cheyenne became increasingly divided into the Northern Cheyenne and Southern Cheyenne, where they could have adequate territory for sustenance. During the California Gold Rush, emigrants brought in cholera. It spread in mining camps and waterways due to poor sanitation. The disease was generally a major cause of death for emigrants, about one-tenth of whom died during their journeys. Perhaps from traders, the cholera epidemic reached the Plains Indians in 1849, resulting in severe loss of life during the summer of that year. Historians estimate about 2,000 Cheyenne died, one-half to two-thirds of their population. There were significant losses among other tribes as well, which weakened their social structures. Perhaps because of severe loss of trade during the 1849 season, Bent's Fort was abandoned and burned.Berthrong, pp. 113‚Äì114 =Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851= Arapaho and Cheyenne 1851 treaty territory. (Area 426 and 477). Area 477 is the reserve established by treaty of Fort Wise, February 18, 1861. He was neutralized during an attack on a Pawnee hunting camp in 1852 In 1846, Thomas Fitzpatrick was appointed US Indian agent for the upper Arkansas and Platte River. His efforts to negotiate with the Northern Cheyenne, the Arapaho and other tribes led to a great council at Fort Laramie in 1851. Treaties were negotiated by a commission consisting of Fitzpatrick and David Dawson Mitchell, US Superintendent of Indian Affairs, with the Indians of the northern plains. To reduce intertribal warfare on the Plains, the government officials \\"assigned\\" territories to each tribe and had them pledge mutual peace. In addition, the government secured permission to build and maintain roads for European-American travelers and traders through Indian country on the Plains, such as the Emigrant Trail and the Santa Fe Trail, and to maintain forts to guard them. The tribes were compensated with annuities of cash and supplies for such encroachment on their territories. The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 affirmed the Cheyenne and Arapaho territory on the Great Plains between the North Platte River and the Arkansas. This territory included what is now Colorado, east of the Front Range of the Rockies and north of the Arkansas River; Wyoming and Nebraska, south of the North Platte River; and extreme western Kansas.Berthrong, pp. 106‚Äì123 =Punitive US expedition of 1857= In April 1856, an incident at the Platte River Bridge (near present-day Casper, Wyoming), resulted in the wounding of a Cheyenne warrior. He returned to the Cheyenne on the plains. During the summer of 1856, Indians attacked travelers along the Emigrant Trail near Fort Kearny. In retaliation, the US Cavalry attacked a Cheyenne camp on Grand Island in Nebraska. They killed ten Cheyenne warriors and wounded eight or more. Cheyenne parties attacked at least three emigrant settler parties before returning to the Republican River. The Indian agent at Fort Laramie negotiated with the Cheyenne to reduce hostilities, but the Secretary of War ordered the 1st Cavalry Regiment (1855) to carry out a punitive expedition under the command of Colonel Edwin V. Sumner. He went against the Cheyenne in the spring of 1857. Major John Sedgwick led part of the expedition up the Arkansas River, and via Fountain Creek to the South Platte River. Sumner's command went west along the North Platte to Fort Laramie, then down along the Front Range to the South Platte. The combined force of 400 troops went east through the plains searching for Cheyenne.Berthrong, pp. 133‚Äì140Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, pp. 111‚Äì121Hyde, pp. 99‚Äì105 Under the influence of the medicine man White Bull (also called Ice) and Grey Beard (also called Dark), the Cheyenne went into battle believing that strong spiritual medicine would prevent the soldiers' guns from firing. They were told that if they dipped their hands in a nearby spring, they had only to raise their hands to repel army bullets. Hands raised, the Cheyenne surrounded the advancing troops as they advanced near the Solomon River. Sumner ordered a cavalry charge and the troops charged with drawn sabers; the Cheyenne fled. With tired horses after long marches, the cavalry could not engage more than a few Cheyenne, as their horses were fresh. This was the first battle which the Cheyenne fought against the US Army. Casualties were few on each side; J.E.B. Stuart, then a young lieutenant, was shot in the breast while attacking a Cheyenne warrior with a sabre. The troops continued on and two days later burned a hastily abandoned Cheyenne camp; they destroyed lodges and the winter supply of buffalo meat.Berthrong, pp. 133 to 140Page 97-98, David Fridtjof Halaas and Andrew E. Masich, Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story Of George Bent ‚Äì Caught Between The Worlds Of The Indian And The White Man, Da Capo Press (March 15, 2005), hardcover, 458 pages, Sumner continued to Bent's Fort. To punish the Cheyenne, he distributed their annuities to the Arapaho. He intended further punitive actions, but the Army ordered him to Utah because of an outbreak of trouble with the Mormons (this would be known as the Utah War). The Cheyenne moved below the Arkansas into Kiowa and Comanche country. In the fall, the Northern Cheyenne returned to their country north of the Platte.Hyde, pp. 99 to 105 =Pike's Peak Gold Rush= Dull Knife (Cheyenne: V√≥√≥h√©h√©ve or Lakota: Tam√≠lap√©≈°ni), Chief of Northern Cheyenne at Battle of Little Bighorn Chief Black Kettle of the Southern Cheyenne, an advocate of peace among his people. Starting in 1859 with the Colorado Gold Rush, European-American settlers moved into lands reserved for the Cheyenne and other Plains Indians. Travel greatly increased along the Emigrant Trail along the South Platte River and some emigrants stopped before going on to California. For several years there was peace between settlers and Indians. The only conflicts were related to the endemic warfare between the Cheyenne and Arapaho of the plains and the Utes of the mountains. US negotiations with Black Kettle and other Cheyenne favoring peace resulted in the Treaty of Fort Wise: it established a small reservation for the Cheyenne in southeastern Colorado in exchange for the territory agreed to in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. Many Cheyenne did not sign the treaty, and they continued to live and hunt on their traditional grounds in the Smokey Hill and Republican basins, between the Arkansas and the South Platte, where there were plentiful buffalo.Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, pp. 124 to 158 Efforts to make a wider peace continued, but in the spring of 1864, John Evans, governor of Colorado Territory, and John Chivington, commander of the Colorado Volunteers, a citizens militia, began a series of attacks on Indians camping or hunting on the plains. They killed any Indian on sight and initiated the Colorado War. General warfare broke out and Indians made many raids on the trail along the South Platte, which Denver depended on for supplies. The Army closed the road from August 15 until September 24, 1864. On November 29, 1864, the Colorado Militia attacked a Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment under Chief Black Kettle, although it flew a flag of truce and indicated its allegiance to the US government. The Sand Creek massacre, as it came to be known, resulted in the death of between 150 and 200 Cheyenne, mostly unarmed women and children. The survivors fled northeast and joined the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican rivers. There warriors smoked the war pipe, passing it from camp to camp among the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho.Hyde, pp. 168 to 195 In January 1865, they planned and carried out an attack with about 1000 warriors on Camp Rankin, a stage station and fort at Julesburg. The Indians made numerous raids along the South Platte, both east and west of Julesburg, and raided the fort again in early February. They captured much loot and killed many European Americans. Most of the Indians moved north into Nebraska on their way to the Black Hills and the Powder River. (See Battle of Julesburg, Battle of Mud Springs, Battle of Rush Creek, Powder River Expedition, Battle of Platte Bridge) Black Kettle continued to desire peace and did not join in the second raid or in the plan to go north to the Powder River country. He left the large camp and returned with 80 lodges of his tribesmen to the Arkansas River, where he intended to seek peace with the US.Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, p. 188 =Battle of Washita River= Four years later, on November 27, 1868, George Armstrong Custer and his troops attacked Black Kettle's band at the Battle of Washita River. Although his band was camped on a defined reservation, complying with the government's orders, some of its members had been linked to raiding into Kansas by bands operating out of the Indian Territory. Custer claimed 103 Cheyenne \\"warriors\\" and an unspecified number of women and children killed whereas different Cheyenne informants named between 11 and 18 men (mostly 10 Cheyenne, 2 Arapaho, 1 Mexican trader) and between 17 and 25 women and children killed in the village. There are conflicting claims as to whether the band was hostile or friendly. Historians believe that Chief Black Kettle, head of the band, was not part of the war party but the peace party within the Cheyenne nation. But, he did not command absolute authority over members of his band and the European Americans did not understand this. When younger members of the band took part in raiding parties, European Americans blamed the entire band for the incidents and casualties. =Battle of the Little Bighorn= The Northern Cheyenne fought in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, which took place on June 25, 1876. The Cheyenne, together with the Lakota, other Sioux warriors and a small band of Arapaho, killed General George Armstrong Custer and much of his 7th Cavalry contingent of soldiers. Historians have estimated that the population of the Cheyenne, Lakota and Arapaho encampment along the Little Bighorn River was approximately 10,000, making it one of the largest gatherings of Native Americans in North America in pre-reservation times. News of the event traveled across the United States and reached Washington, D.C., just as the nation was celebrating its Centennial. Public reaction arose in outrage against the Cheyenne. =Northern Cheyenne Exodus= Little Coyote (Little Wolf) and Morning Star (Dull Knife), chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Cheyenne prisoners in Kansas involved in escape northward. From left to right: Tangle Hair, Wild Hog, Strong Left Hand, George Reynolds (interpreter), Old Crow, Noisy Walker, Porcupine, and Blacksmith. All prisoners were released free from charges. Following the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the US Army increased attempts to capture the Cheyenne. In 1879, after the Dull Knife Fight, when Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson, a few Cheyenne chiefs and their people surrendered as well. They were Dull Knife, Standing Elk and Wild Hog with around 130 Cheyenne. Later that year Two Moons surrendered at Fort Keogh, with 300 Cheyenne. The Cheyenne wanted and expected to live on the reservation with the Sioux in accordance to an April 29, 1868 treaty of Fort Laramie, which both Dull Knife and Little Wolf had signed.Brown, pp. 332‚Äì349 As part of a US increase in troops following the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Army reassigned Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie and his Fourth Cavalry to the Department of the Platte. Stationed initially at Camp Robinson, they formed the core of the Powder River Expedition. It departed in October 1876 to locate the northern Cheyenne villages. On November 25, 1876, his column discovered and defeated a village of Northern Cheyenne in the Dull Knife Fight in Wyoming Territory. After the soldiers destroyed the lodges and supplies, and confiscated the horses, the Northern Cheyenne soon surrendered. They hoped to remain with the Sioux in the north but the US pressured them to locate with the Southern Cheyenne on their reservation in Indian Territory. After a difficult council, the Northern Cheyenne eventually agreed to go South. When the Northern Cheyenne arrived at Indian Territory, conditions were very difficult: rations were inadequate, there were no buffalo near the reservation and, according to several sources, there was malaria among the people. On 9 September 1878, a portion of the Northern Cheyenne, led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife started their trek back to the north. On reaching the northern area, they split into two bands. That led by Dull Knife (mostly women, children and elders) surrendered and were taken to Fort Robinson, where subsequent events became known as the Fort Robinson tragedy. Dull Knife's group was first offered food and firewood and then, after a week and a half, they were told to go back to Indian territory. When they said no, they were then locked in the wooden barracks with no food, water or firewood for heat for four days. Most escaped in an estimated forty degrees below zero on January 9, 1879, but all were recaptured or killed. Eventually the US forced the Northern Cheyenne onto a reservation, in southern Montana.Maddux Albert Glenn, In Dull Knife's Wake: The True Story of the Northern Cheyenne Exodus of 1878, Horse Creek Publications (2003), Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyenne, pp. 398‚Äì427 Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation flag White Buffalo, a Northern Cheyenne chief who received the rank of sergeant in the United States Army. The Cheyenne who traveled to Fort Keogh (present day Miles City, Montana), including Little Wolf, settled near the fort. Many of the Cheyenne worked with the army as scouts. The Cheyenne scouts were pivotal in helping the Army find Chief Joseph and his band of Nez Perc√© in northern Montana. Fort Keogh became a staging and gathering point for the Northern Cheyenne. Many families began to migrate south to the Tongue River watershed area, where they established homesteads.\\"WE, THE NORTHERN CHEYENNE PEOPLE: Our Land, Our History, Our Culture\\", Chief Dull Knife College. Page 30. Accessed September 20, 2009 Map of Indian Reservations in the state of Montana including the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The US established the Tongue River Indian Reservation, now named the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, of by the executive order of President Chester A. Arthur November 16, 1884. It excluded Cheyenne who had homesteaded further east near the Tongue River. The western boundary is the Crow Indian Reservation. On March 19, 1900, President William McKinley extended the reservation to the west bank of the Tongue River, making a total of . Those who had homesteaded east of the Tongue River were relocated to the west of the river. The Northern Cheyenne, who were sharing the Lakota land at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were finally allowed to return to the Tongue River on their own reservation. Along with the Lakota and Apache, the Cheyenne were the last nations to be subdued and placed on reservations. (The Seminole tribe of Florida never made a treaty with the US government.) The Northern Cheyenne were given the right to remain in the north, near the Black Hills, land which they consider sacred. The Cheyenne also managed to retain their culture, religion and language. Today, the Northern Cheyenne Nation is one of the few American Indian nations to have control over the majority of its land base, currently 98%. Culture Cheyenne courting scenes, by Big Back, before 1882 Over the past 400 years, the Cheyenne have changed their lifestyles. In the 16th century, they lived in the regions near the Great Lakes. They farmed corn, squash, and beans, and harvested wild rice like other indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands. They migrated west in the 18th century and hunted bison on the Great Plains. By the mid-19th century, the US forced them onto reservations. The traditional Cheyenne government system is a politically unified system. The central traditional government system of the Cheyenne is the Arrow Keeper, followed by the Council of Forty-Four. Early in Cheyenne history, three related tribes, known as the Heviqsnipahis, the S√≥'taeo'o and the Masikota, unified themselves to form the Ts√©-ts√™h√©st√¢hese or the \\"Like Hearted People\\" who are known today as the \\"Cheyenne\\". The unified tribe then divided themselves into ten principal bands: * Heviksnipahis (Iviststsinihpah) * H√©vhaitanio (He√©v√¢hetaneo'o) * Masikota * Om√≠sis (√îhm√©s√™heseo'o, the Notameohm√©s√™hese proper) * S√≥'taeo'o (Suhtai or Sutaio, Northern and Southern) * Wot√°pio * Oivim√°na (O√©vemana, Northern and Southern) * His√≠ometanio (Hes√©'ome√©taneo'o or Issiometaniu) * Ohktounna (Oqt√≥guna) * H√≥nowa (H√°ov√¥hn√≥va) Each of the ten bands had four seated chief delegates; the remaining four chiefs were the principal advisers of the other delegates. Smaller bands or sub-bands had no right to send delegates to the council. This system also regulated the Cheyenne military societies that developed for planning warfare, enforcing rules, and conducting ceremonies. Anthropologists debate about Cheyenne society organization. On the plains, it appears that they had a bilateral band kinship system. However, some anthropologists reported that the Cheyenne had a matrilineal band system. Studies into whether, and if so, how much the Cheyenne developed a matrilineal clan system are continuing. Traditional Cheyenne plains culture While they participated in nomadic Plains horse culture, men hunted and occasionally fought with and raided other tribes.Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, Vol. 1, pp. 258‚Äì311 The women tanned and dressed hides for clothing, shelter, and other uses.Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, pp. 1‚Äì57 They also gathered roots, berries, and other useful plants.Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, Vol. 1, pp. 247‚Äì311 From the products of hunting and gathering, the women also made lodges, clothing, and other equipment.Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, Vol. 1, 209‚Äì246 Their lives were active and physically demanding.Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, Vol. 1, pp. 63‚Äì71, 127‚Äì129, 247‚Äì311 The range of the Cheyenne was first the area in and near the Black Hills, but later all the Great Plains from Dakota to the Arkansas River. Role models A Cheyenne woman has a higher status if she is part of an extended family with distinguished ancestors. Also, if she is friendly and compatible with her female relatives and does not have members in her extended family who are alcoholics or otherwise in disrepute. It is expected of all Cheyenne women to be hardworking, chaste, modest, skilled in traditional crafts, knowledgeable about Cheyenne culture and history and speak Cheyenne fluently. Tribal powwow princesses are expected to have these characteristics.Moore, pp. 154‚Äì156 Ethnobotany An infusion of the pulverized leaves and blossoms of tansy is used for dizziness and weakness.Grinnell, George Bird 1972 The Cheyenne Indians ‚Äì Their History and Ways of Life Vol.2.

Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether. The notion of a Noetherian ring is of fundamental importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both Noetherian rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals. This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for Noetherian rings beginning with the notion of the Krull dimension.  Characterizations  For noncommutative rings, it is necessary to distinguish between three very similar concepts: * A ring is left-Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on left ideals. * A ring is right-Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on right ideals. * A ring is Noetherian if it is both left- and right-Noetherian. For commutative rings, all three concepts coincide, but in general they are different. There are rings that are left- Noetherian and not right-Noetherian, and vice versa. There are other, equivalent, definitions for a ring R to be left-Noetherian: * Every left ideal I in R is finitely generated, i.e. there exist elements a_1, \\\\ldots , a_n in I such that I=Ra_1 + \\\\cdots + Ra_n.Lam (2001), p. 19 * Every non-empty set of left ideals of R, partially ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element. Similar results hold for right-Noetherian rings. The following condition is also an equivalent condition for a ring R to be left-Noetherian and it is Hilbert's original formulation: *Given a sequence f_1, f_2, \\\\dots of elements in R, there exists an integer n such that each f_i is a finite linear combination f_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n r_j f_j with coefficients r_j in R. For a commutative ring to be Noetherian it suffices that every prime ideal of the ring is finitely generated.  Properties  * If R is a Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring R[X] is Noetherian by the Hilbert's basis theorem. By induction, R[X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n] is a Noetherian ring. Also, , the power series ring is a Noetherian ring. * If is a Noetherian ring and is a two-sided ideal, then the quotient ring is also Noetherian. Stated differently, the image of any surjective ring homomorphism of a Noetherian ring is Noetherian. * Every finitely-generated commutative algebra over a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian. (This follows from the two previous properties.) * A ring R is left-Noetherian if and only if every finitely generated left R-module is a Noetherian module. * If a commutative ring admits a faithful Noetherian module over it, then the ring is a Noetherian ring. * (Eakin‚ÄìNagata) If a ring A is a subring of a commutative Noetherian ring B such that B is a finitely generated module over A, then A is a Noetherian ring. *Similarly, if a ring A is a subring of a commutative Noetherian ring B such that B is faithfully flat over A (or more generally exhibits A as a pure subring), then A is a Noetherian ring (see the \\"faithfully flat\\" article for the reasoning). * Every localization of a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian. * A consequence of the Akizuki-Hopkins-Levitzki Theorem is that every left Artinian ring is left Noetherian. Another consequence is that a left Artinian ring is right Noetherian if and only if right Artinian. The analogous statements with \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" interchanged are also true. * A left Noetherian ring is left coherent and a left Noetherian domain is a left Ore domain. * (Bass) A ring is (left/right) Noetherian if and only if every direct sum of injective (left/right) modules is injective. Every left injective module over a left Noetherian module can be decomposed as a direct sum of indecomposable injective modules. * In a commutative Noetherian ring, there are only finitely many minimal prime ideals. Also, the descending chain condition holds on prime ideals. * In a commutative Noetherian domain R, every element can be factorized into irreducible elements. Thus, if, in addition, irreducible elements are prime elements, then R is a unique factorization domain.  Examples  * Any field, including fields of rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, is Noetherian. (A field only has two ideals -- itself and (0).) * Any principal ideal ring, such as the integers, is Noetherian since every ideal is generated by a single element. This includes principal ideal domains and Euclidean domains. * A Dedekind domain (e.g., rings of integers) is a Noetherian domain in which every ideal is generated by at most two elements. * The coordinate ring of an affine variety is a Noetherian ring, as a consequence of the Hilbert basis theorem. * The enveloping algebra U of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} is a both left and right Noetherian ring; this follows from the fact that the associated graded ring of U is a quotient of \\\\operatorname{Sym}(\\\\mathfrak{g}), which is a polynomial ring over a field; thus, Noetherian. For the same reason, the Weyl algebra, and more general rings of differential operators, are Noetherian. * The ring of polynomials in finitely-many variables over the integers or a field is Noetherian. Rings that are not Noetherian tend to be (in some sense) very large. Here are some examples of non-Noetherian rings: * The ring of polynomials in infinitely-many variables, X1, X2, X3, etc. The sequence of ideals (X1), (X1, X2), (X1, X2, X3), etc. is ascending, and does not terminate. * The ring of all algebraic integers is not Noetherian. For example, it contains the infinite ascending chain of principal ideals: (2), (21/2), (21/4), (21/8), ... * The ring of continuous functions from the real numbers to the real numbers is not Noetherian: Let In be the ideal of all continuous functions f such that f(x) = 0 for all x ‚â• n. The sequence of ideals I0, I1, I2, etc., is an ascending chain that does not terminate. * The ring of stable homotopy groups of spheres is not Noetherian. The ring of stable homotopy groups of spheres is not noetherian However, a non-Noetherian ring can be a subring of a Noetherian ring. Since any integral domain is a subring of a field, any integral domain that is not Noetherian provides an example. To give a less trivial example, * The ring of rational functions generated by x and y/xn over a field k is a subring of the field k(x,y) in only two variables. Indeed, there are rings that are right Noetherian, but not left Noetherian, so that one must be careful in measuring the \\"size\\" of a ring this way. For example, if L is a subgroup of Q2 isomorphic to Z, let R be the ring of homomorphisms f from Q2 to itself satisfying f(L) ‚äÇ L. Choosing a basis, we can describe the same ring R as :R=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left.\\\\begin{bmatrix}a & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & \\\\gamma \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\, \\\\right\\\\vert\\\\, a\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, \\\\beta\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q},\\\\gamma\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This ring is right Noetherian, but not left Noetherian; the subset I‚äÇR consisting of elements with a=0 and Œ≥=0 is a left ideal that is not finitely generated as a left R-module. If R is a commutative subring of a left Noetherian ring S, and S is finitely generated as a left R-module, then R is Noetherian. (In the special case when S is commutative, this is known as Eakin's theorem.) However this is not true if R is not commutative: the ring R of the previous paragraph is a subring of the left Noetherian ring S = Hom(Q2,Q2), and S is finitely generated as a left R-module, but R is not left Noetherian. A unique factorization domain is not necessarily a Noetherian ring. It does satisfy a weaker condition: the ascending chain condition on principal ideals. A ring of polynomials in infinitely-many variables is an example of a non-Noetherian unique factorization domain. A valuation ring is not Noetherian unless it is a principal ideal domain. It gives an example of a ring that arises naturally in algebraic geometry but is not Noetherian.  Key theorems  Many important theorems in ring theory (especially the theory of commutative rings) rely on the assumptions that the rings are Noetherian. Commutative case *Over a commutative Noetherian ring, each ideal has a primary decomposition, meaning that it can be written as an intersection of finitely many primary ideals (whose radicals are all distinct) where an ideal Q is called primary if it is proper and whenever xy ‚àà Q, either x ‚àà Q or yn ‚àà Q for some positive integer n. For example, if an element f = p_1^{n_1} \\\\cdots p_r^{n_r} is a product of powers of distinct prime elements, then (f) = (p_1^{n_1}) \\\\cap \\\\cdots \\\\cap (p_r^{n_r}) and thus the primary decomposition is a direct generalization of prime factorization of integers and polynomials. *A Noetherian ring is defined in terms of ascending chains of ideals. The Artin‚ÄìRees lemma, on the other hand, gives some information about a descending chain of ideals given by powers of ideals I \\\\supseteq I^2 \\\\supseteq I^3 \\\\supseteq \\\\cdots . It is a technical tool that is used to prove other key theorems such as the Krull intersection theorem. *The dimension theory of commutative rings behaves poorly over non-Noetherian rings; the very fundamental theorem, Krull's principal ideal theorem, already relies on the \\"Noetherian\\" assumption. Here, in fact, the \\"Noetherian\\" assumption is often not enough and (Noetherian) universally catenary rings, those satisfying a certain dimension-theoretic assumption, are often used instead. Noetherian rings appearing in applications are mostly universally catenary. Non-commutative case *Goldie's theorem  Implication on injective modules  Given a ring, there is a close connection between the behaviors of injective modules over the ring and whether the ring is a Noetherian ring or not. Namely, given a ring R, the following are equivalent: *R is a left Noetherian ring. *(Bass) Each direct sum of injective left R-modules is injective. *Each injective left R-module is a direct sum of indecomposable injective modules. *(Faith‚ÄìWalker) There exists a cardinal number \\\\mathfrak{c} such that each injective left module over R is a direct sum of \\\\mathfrak{c}-generated modules (a module is \\\\mathfrak{c}-generated if it has a generating set of cardinality at most \\\\mathfrak{c}). *There exists a left R-module H such that every left R-module embeds into a direct sum of copies of H. The endomorphism ring of an indecomposable injective module is local and thus Azumaya's theorem says that, over a left Noetherian ring, each indecomposable decomposition of an injective module is equivalent to one another (a variant of the Krull‚ÄìSchmidt theorem).

The second of the comic's nine volumes was adapted in 1993 into a two-part anime original video animation titled Battle Angel for North American release by ADV Films and the UK and Australian release by Manga Entertainment. Manga Entertainment also dubbed Battle Angel Alita into English. A live-action film adaptation titled Alita: Battle Angel was released on February 14, 2019. The series is set in the post-apocalyptic future and focuses on Alita (\\"Gally\\" in the original Japanese version, and several other countries), a female cyborg who has lost all memories and is found in a junkyard by a cybernetics doctor who rebuilds and takes care of her. She discovers that there is one thing she remembers, the legendary cyborg martial art Panzer Kunst, which leads to her becoming a Hunter Warrior, or bounty hunter. The story traces Alita's attempts to rediscover her past and the characters whose lives she impacts on her journey. The manga series is continued in Battle Angel Alita: Last Order and Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle. Plot Battle Angel Alita tells the story of Alita, an amnesiac female cyborg. Her intact head and chest, in suspended animation, are found by cybermedic expert Daisuke Ido in the local garbage dump. Ido manages to revive her, and finding she has lost her memory, names her Alita after his recently deceased cat. The rebuilt Alita soon discovers that she instinctively remembers the legendary martial art Panzer Kunst, although she does not recall anything else. Alita uses her Panzer Kunst to first become a bounty hunter killing cyborg criminals in the Scrapyard, and then as a star player in the brutal gladiator sport of Motorball. While in combat, Alita awakens memories of her earlier life on Mars. She becomes involved with the floating city of Zalem (Tiphares in some older translations) as one of their agents, and is sent to hunt down criminals. Foremost is the mad genius Desty Nova, who has a complex, ever-changing relationship with Alita. The futuristic dystopian world of Battle Angel Alita revolves around the city of Scrapyard (Kuzutetsu in the Japanese and various other versions), which has grown up around a massive scrap heap that rains down from Zalem. Ground dwellers have no access to Zalem and are forced to make a living in the sprawl below. Many are heavily modified by cybernetics to better cope with their hard life. Zalem exploits the Scrapyard and surrounding farms, paying bounty hunters (called Hunter-Warriors) to hunt criminals and arranging violent sports to keep the population entertained. Massive tubes connect the Scrapyard to Zalem, and the city uses robots for carrying out errands and providing security on the ground. Occasionally, Zalemites (such as Daisuke Ido and Desty Nova) are exiled and sent to the ground. Aside from the robots and exiles, there is little contact between the two cities. The story takes place in the former United States. According to a map, printed in the eighth volume, Scrapyard/Zalem is near Kansas City, Missouri, and the Necropolis is Colorado Springs, Colorado. Radio KAOS is at Dallas, Texas. Figure's coastal hometown is Alhambra, California. Desty Nova's Granite Inn is built out of a military base‚ÄîNORAD at Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado. Battle Angel Alita is eventually revealed to take place in the 26th century. The sequel Battle Angel Alita: Last Order introduces a calendar era called \\"Era Sputnik\\" which has an epoch of AD 1957. The original Battle Angel Alita series begins in ES 577 (AD 2533) and ends in ES 590 (AD 2546), Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is mostly set roughly in ES 591 (AD 2547), and Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle currently alternates between ES 373‚Äì374 (AD 2329‚Äì2330) and ES 594 (AD 2550). Characters Battle Angel Alita features a diverse cast of characters, many of whom shift in and out of focus as the story progresses. Some are never to be seen again following the conclusion of a story arc, while others make recurring appearances. The one character who remains a constant throughout is Alita, the protagonist and title character, a young cyborg with amnesia struggling to uncover her forgotten past through the only thing she remembers from it: by fighting. Early on in the story, Daisuke Ido, a bounty-hunting cybernetic doctor who finds and revives Alita, plays a major role as well, but midway the focus begins to increasingly shift to Desty Nova, an eccentric nanotechnology scientist who has fled from Zalem. Desty Nova is the mastermind behind many of the enemies and trials that Alita faces, but does not make an actual appearance until more than two years into the story, although he is alluded to early on. Finally, Kaos, Desty Nova's son, a frail and troubled radio DJ with psychometric powers, also begins to play a crucial role after he comes in contact with Alita. He broadcasts his popular radio show from the wastelands outside the Scrapyard, staying away from the increasing conflict between Zalem and the rebel army Barjack. Production Alita was originally a female cyborg police officer named Gally in an unpublished comic called Reimeika (Rainmaker). Publishers at Shueisha liked her and asked Kishiro to make a new story with her as the main character. After he had come up with the plot for a storyline he was commissioned to make it a long-running series. Besides renaming Gally to Alita, older North American versions of the manga also changed the city of Zalem (meaning oppressor in Arabic and Persian) to Tiphares, after Tiferet. Since Kishiro also used the name Jeru for the facility atop Zalem, Jeru was renamed Ketheres in the translation, after Keter. More recent versions reverted the cities' names back to Zalem and Jeru. To further develop the Biblical theme in the original series, Zalem's main computer was named Melchizedek, \\"the king of Salem\\" and \\"priest to the Most High God\\".Genesis 14:18; Melchizedek was renamed \\"David\\" in the first North American release of Battle Angel Alita. Subsequent releases retain the original name. Media Manga The manga was first published in Shueisha's Business Jump magazine. It was then serialized from 1990 to 1995 in nine tank≈çbon. Yukito Kishiro moved from Shueisha to Kodansha in August 2010. The company acquired the license rights to Battle Angel Alita. In North America, Viz Media originally released the story in a 25-page comic book, after which it followed the same volume format as its Japanese counterpart. Along with the rest of the series, Kishiro's original Battle Angel Alita manga is licensed for North American publication through Kodansha USA. Battle Angel Alita was licensed for international release in a number of languages and regions. It was published in Spain by Planeta DeAgostini, in Brazil by Editora JBC, in France and Netherlands by Glenat, in Poland by JPF, in Germany by Carlsen, in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing and in Argentina by Editorial Ivrea. Another series titled was published in Ultra Jump from January 24, 1997, to December 19, 2006. It was released in a single volume on December 19, 2007. It is composed of four short side stories: Holy Night, Sonic Finger, Hometown and Barjack Rhapsody. The series has been licensed by Kodansha USA, who published it digitally on October 30, 2018 and as hardcover on November 20, 2018. A 6-volume special edition titled Gunnm: Complete Edition was released in Japan on December 23, 1998. The series was released in B5 format and contains the original story. Also included are rough sketches, a timeline and the first three Battle Angel Alita: Holy Night & Other Stories short stories. A novel was released on April 4, 1997, by JUMP j-BOOKS, as part of Shueisha. From October 5 to November 16, 2016, Kodansha republished Gunnm in B5 format. It was later reprinted in A5 format starting on November 21, 2018. OVA A two-episode OVA was released in 1993, incorporating elements from the second volume of the manga with changes to the characters and storyline. According to Kishiro, only two episodes were originally planned. At the time, he was too busy with the manga \\"to review the plan coolly\\" and was not serious about an anime adaptation. It remains the only anime adaptation of Battle Angel Alita to date and there are no plans to revive it. Alita as depicted in the 1998 CG movie clip A 3-minute 3D-CGI rendered movie clip is included in volume 6 of the Japanese Gunnm: Complete Edition (1998). It showcases Alita in a Third League Motorball race with players from two of her races such as \\"Armor\\" Togo, Degchalev, and Valdicci, and depicts events from both of those races. Cinematic adaptation Director James Cameron acquired film rights to Battle Angel. It was originally brought to Cameron's attention by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. Cameron is said to be a big fan of the manga, and he was waiting until CGI technology was sufficiently advanced to make a live-action 3D film with effects comparable to Avatar. The film would be a live-action adaptation of the first four volumes of the manga series; \\"What I‚Äôm going to do is take the spine story and use elements from the first four books. So, the Motorball from books three and four, and parts of the story of one and two will all be in the movie.\\" Alita was originally scheduled to be his next production after the TV series Dark Angel, which was influenced by Battle Angel Alita. After Avatar, he stated he would work on Avatar sequels before starting Alita. Cameron's producer Jon Landau said, \\"I am sure you will get to see Battle Angel. It is one of my favourite stories, a great story about a young woman's journey to self-discovery. It is a film that asks the question: What does it mean to be human? Are you human if you have a heart, a brain or a soul? I look forward to giving the audience the film.\\" Landau half-jokingly stated that the project may be titled Alita: The Battle Angel, because of Cameron's tradition in naming his films with either an \\"A\\" or a \\"T\\". In October 2015, it was reported that Robert Rodriguez would direct the film with Cameron and Landau producing. On April 26, 2016, both The Hollywood Reporter and Variety reported that Maika Monroe, Rosa Salazar, Zendaya and Bella Thorne were in the running for the lead role. Near the end of May 2016, Salazar was cast as Alita, and on February 7, 2017, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Jennifer Connelly would be joining the cast as one of the villains. On December 8, 2017, the first trailer for Battle Angel was released to the public, and the film, titled Alita: Battle Angel and directed by Robert Rodriguez, came out in 2019. Tie-in novel In November 2018, Titan Books published Alita: Battle Angel‚ÄîIron City, a prequel novel for the film. The novel was written by Pat Cadigan, a notable science fiction author.https://books.google.com/books?id=ompBDwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover#v=twopage&q;&f;=false Video game Gunnm: Martian Memory is an action RPG video game for the PlayStation by Banpresto. It is an adaptation of the manga, following Alita (Gally) from her discovery in the Zalem dump heap by Daisuke Ido up through and beyond her career as a TUNED agent. The story includes additional elements that Kishiro had conceived when he ended the original manga in 1995, but was unable to implement at the time, which involved Alita going into outer space. He then expanded the story, which formed the basis for the manga Battle Angel Alita: Last Order. Related works * Ashen Victor, a story set six years before the beginning of Battle Angel Alita.

About 10,000 BC, following the retreat of the great inland ice sheets, the earliest inhabitants migrated north into the territory which is now Norway. They traveled steadily northwards along the coastal areas, warmed by the Gulf Stream, where life was more bearable. In order to survive they fished and hunted reindeer (and other prey). Between 5,000 BC and 4,000 BC the earliest agricultural settlements appeared around the Oslofjord. Gradually, between 1500 BC and 500 BC, these agricultural settlements spread into the southern areas of Norway ‚Äì whilst the inhabitants of the northern regions continued to hunt and fish. The Neolithic period started in 4000 BC. The Migration Period caused the first chieftains to take control and the first defenses to be made. From the last decades of the 8th century Norwegians started expanding across the seas to the British Isles and later Iceland and Greenland. The Viking Age also saw the unification of the country. Christianization took place during the 11th century and Nidaros became an archdiocese. The population expanded quickly until 1349 (Oslo: 3,000; Bergen: 7,000; Trondheim: 4,000) when it was halved by the Black Death and successive plagues. Bergen became the main trading port, controlled by the Hanseatic League. Norway entered the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Sweden in 1397. After Sweden left the union in 1523, Norway became the junior partner in Denmark‚ÄìNorway. The Reformation was introduced in 1537 and absolute monarchy imposed in 1661. In 1814, after being on the losing side of the Napoleonic Wars with Denmark, Norway was ceded to the king of Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel. Norway declared its independence and adopted a constitution. However, no foreign powers recognized the Norwegian independence but supported the Swedish demand for Norway to comply with the treaty of Kiel. After a short war with Sweden, the countries concluded the Convention of Moss, in which Norway accepted a personal union with Sweden, keeping its Constitution, Storting and separate institutions, except for the foreign service. The union was formally established after the extraordinary Storting adopted the necessary amendments to the Constitution and elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway on 4 November 1814. Industrialization started in the 1840s and from the 1860s large-scale emigration to North America took place. In 1884 the king appointed Johan Sverdrup as prime minister, thus establishing parliamentarism. The union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Norwegians such as Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen carried out a series of important polar expeditions. Shipping and hydroelectricity were important sources of income for the country. The following decades saw a fluctuating economy and the rise of the labor movement. Germany occupied Norway between 1940 and 1945 during the Second World War, after which Norway joined NATO and underwent a period of reconstruction under public planning. Oil was discovered in 1969 and by 1995 Norway was the world's second-largest exporter. This resulted in a large increase of wealth. From the 1980s Norway started deregulation in many sectors and experienced a banking crisis. By the 21st century, Norway became one of the world's most prosperous countries with oil and gas production accounting for 20 percent of its economy. By reinvesting its oil revenues, Norway had the world's largest sovereign wealth fund in 2017. Prehistory Norway's coastline rose from glaciation with the end of the last glacial period about 12,000 B.C. The first immigration took place during this period as the Norwegian coast offered good conditions for sealing, fishing, and hunting.Stenersen: 7 They were nomadic and by 9300 B.C they were already settled at Mager√∏ya. Increased ice receding from 8000 B.C. caused settlement along the entire coastline. The Stone Age consisted of the Komsa culture in Troms and Finnmark and the Fosna culture further south. The N√∏stvet culture took over from the Fosna culture ca. 7000 BC,Stenersen: 8 which adapted to a warmer climate which gave increased forestation and new mammals for hunting. The oldest human skeleton ever discovered in Norway was found in shallow water off Sogne in 1994 and has been carbon dated to 6,600 BC. Ca. 4000 BC people in the north started using slate tools, earthenware, skis, sleds and large skin boats.Stenersen: 9 Rock carvings at Alta The first farming and thus the start of the Neolithic period, began ca. 4000 BC around the Oslofjord, with the technology coming from southern Scandinavia.Stenersen: 10 The break-through occurred between 2900 and 2500 BC, when oats, barley, pigs, cattle, sheep and goats became common and spread as far north as Alta. This period also saw the arrival of the Corded Ware culture, which brought new weapons, tools and an Indo-European dialect, from which the Norwegian language developed.Stenersen: 11 Nordic Bronze Age (1800‚Äì500 BC) The Bronze Age started in 1800 BC and involved innovations such as ploughing fields with ards, permanent farms with houses and yards, especially in the fertile areas around the Oslofjord, Trondheimsfjord, Mj√∏sa and J√¶ren. Some yields were so high that it allowed farmers to trade furs and skins for luxury items, especially with Jutland.Stenersen: 12 About 1000 BC, speakers of Uralic languages arrived in the north and assimilated with the indigenous population, becoming the Sami people. According to Ante Aikio the formation of the S√°mi language was completed in its southernmost area of usage (central Scandinavia, South S√°pmi) by 500 AD. A climate shift with colder weather started about 500 BC. The forests, which had previously consisted of elm, lime, ash and oak, were replaced with birch, pine and spruce. The climate changes also meant that farmers started building more structures for shelter. Knowledge of ironworking was introduced from the Celts, resulting in better weapons and tools. Nordic Iron Age (500 BC‚Äì800 AD) The Iron Age allowed for easier cultivation and thus new areas were cleared as the population grew with the increased harvests. A new social structure evolved: when sons married, they would remain in the same house; such an extended family was a clan. They would offer protection from other clans; if conflicts arose, the issue would be decided at a thing, a sacred place where all freemen from the surrounding area would assemble and could determine punishments for crimes, such as paying fines in food.Stenersen: 15 From the first century AD a cultural influence from the Roman Empire took place. Norwegians adapted letters and created their own alphabet, runes. Trading with Romans also took place, largely furs and skins in exchange for luxury goods. Some Scandinavians also served as Roman mercenaries. Some of the most powerful farmers became chieftains. They functioned as priests and accepted sacrifices from farmers which were again used to pay soldiers, creating a hird. Thus they were able to rule an area of several settlements and tribes.Stenersen: 16 The chieftains' power increased during the Migration Period between 400 and 550 as other Germanic tribes migrated northwards and local farmers wanted protection. This also resulted in the construction of simple fortifications. A plague hit southern Norway in the 6th century, with hundreds of farms being depopulated. Most were repopulated in the 7th century, which also saw the construction of several fishing hamlets and a boom in trade of iron and soapstone across the North Sea. Some chieftains were able to control most of the trade and grew in power throughout the 8th century.Stenersen: 17 = Archaeological findings = In February 2020, Secrets of the Ice Program researchers discovered a 1,500-year-old Viking arrowhead dating back to the Germanic Iron age and locked in a glacier in southern Norway caused by the climate change in the Jotunheimen Mountains. The arrowhead made of iron was revealed with its cracked wooden shaft and a feather, is 17 cm long and weighs just 28 grams. Viking Age Reconstruction of a longhouse at Lofoten The Viking Age was a period of Scandinavian expansion through trade, colonization and raids. One of the first raids was against Lindisfarne in 793 and is considered the beginning of the Viking Age.Stenersen: 19 This was possible because of the development of the longship, suitable for travel across the sea, and advanced navigation techniques.Stenersen: 20 Vikings were well equipped, had chain mail armor, were well trained and had a psychological advantage over Christian counterparts since they believed that being killed in combat would result in them going to Valhalla. In addition to gold and silver, an important outcome from the raids were thralls, which were brought to the Norwegian farms as a slave workforce. While the men were out at sea, the management of the farm was under the control of the women.Stenersen: 23 The lack of suitable farming land in Western Norway caused Norwegians to travel to the sparsely populated areas of Shetland, Orkney, the Faroe Islands and the Hebrides to colonize‚Äîthe latter of which became the Kingdom of the Isles. Norwegian Vikings settled on the east coast of Ireland circa 800 and founded the island's first cities, including Dublin. Their arrival caused the petty Celtic kings to ally, and by 900 they had driven out the Norwegians.Stenersen: 24 Petty kingdoms of Norway ca. 872 In the mid-9th century, the largest chieftains of the petty kingdoms started a major power struggle. Harald Fairhair started the process of unifying Norway when he entered an alliance with the Earls of Lade and was able to unify the country after the decisive Battle of Hafrsfjord (circa 870‚Äì900). He set up the very basics of a state administration with stewards in the most important former chieftain estates. Iceland, then uninhabited, was discovered by Norwegians during the late 9th century. By 930 the island had been divided among 400 Norse chieftains.Stenersen: 25 H√•kon the Good ‚Äì the son of Harald Fairhair ‚Äì assumed the crown in 930 and established two large things, assemblies in which the king met with the freemen to make decisions: Gulating for Western Norway and Frostating for Tr√∏ndelag. He also established the ledang, a conscription-based military. After his death in 960, war broke out between the Fairhair dynasty and the Earls of Lade in alliance with Danish kings.Stenersen: 28 Led by Erik the Red, a Norwegian-born man, a group of Icelanders settled on Greenland in the 980s. Erik's son, Leif Ericson, discovered Newfoundland in ca. 1000, naming it Vinland. Unlike Greenland, no permanent settlement was established there.Stenersen: 27 Middle Ages The Kingdom of Norway about 1265, at its greatest extent Christianization and the abolition of the rites in Norse mythology were first attempted by Olav Tryggvason, but he was killed in the Battle of Svolder in 1000.Stenersen: 29 Olav Haraldsson, starting in 1015, made the things pass church laws, destroyed heathen hofs, built churches and created an institution of priests. Many chieftains feared that Christianization would rob them of power as Go√∞ar in traditional Norse paganism. The two sides met in the Battle of Stiklestad, where Haraldsson was killed.Stenersen: 31 The church elevated Haraldsson to sainthood, and Nidaros (today Trondheim) became the Christian centre of Norway.Stenersen: 33 Within a few years the Danish rule had become sufficiently unpopular that Norway again became united.Stenersen: 34 From the 1040s to 1130 the country was at peace.Stenersen: 36 In 1130, a civil war era broke out over succession to the throne, which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. At times there were periods of peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 in an attempt to control the appointment of kings.Stenersen: 38 The church inevitably had to take sides in these conflicts, with the church's influence on the king also becoming an issue in the civil wars. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of H√•kon H√•konsson, who introduced clear succession laws.Stenersen: 39 He also managed to subject Greenland and Iceland to Norwegian rule; the Icelandic Commonwealth thus came to an end after the Age of the Sturlungs civil war resulted in a pro-Norwegian victory. The population increased from 150,000 in 1000 to 400,000 in 1300, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300 seventy percent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because farmers would borrow money in poor times and not being able to repay them. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.Stenersen: 37 14th century Bryggen in Bergen, once the centre of trade in Norway under the Hanseatic League trade network, now preserved as a World Heritage Site The 14th century is described as Norway's Golden Age, with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the High Middle Ages the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.Stenersen: 41 In 1349, the Black Death spread to Norway and within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more animal husbandry. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,Stenersen: 44 and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some to mere farmers. High tithes to the church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the Council of State.Stenersen: 45 The Hanseatic League took control of Norwegian trade in the 14th century and established a trading centre in Bergen. In 1380, Olaf Haakonsson inherited both the Norwegian and Danish thrones, creating a union between the two countries. In 1397, under Margaret I, the Kalmar Union was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegians, which resulted in a rebellion. However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.Stenersen: 46 Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark, because it had a greater population than Norway and Sweden combined.Derry p.75 Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of L√ºbeck in Bergen in return for recognition of her right to rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.Derry pp. 77-78 Even worse were the pirates, the \\"Victual Brothers\\", who launched three devastating raids on the port (the last in 1427).Derry p.77 Norway slipped ever more to the background under the Oldenburg dynasty (established 1448). There was one revolt under Knut Alvsson in 1502.Derry pp. 81-82 Norwegians had some affection for King Christian II, who resided in the country for several years. Norway did not take any part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the 1520s.Derry pp.83-84 Denmark‚ÄìNorway Sweden was able to pull out of the Kalmar Union in 1523, thus creating Denmark‚ÄìNorway under the rule of a king in Copenhagen. Frederick I of Denmark favoured Martin Luther's Reformation, but it was not popular in Norway, where the Church was the one national institution and the country was too poor for the clergy to be very corrupt. Initially, Frederick agreed not to try to introduce Protestantism to Norway but in 1529 he changed his mind. Norwegian resistance was led by Olav Engelbrektsson, Archbishop of Trondheim, who invited the old king Christian II back from his exile in the Netherlands. Christian returned but his army was defeated and Christian spent the rest of his life in prison. When Frederick died and a three-way war of succession broke out between the supporters of his eldest son Christian (III), his younger Catholic brother Hans and the followers of Christian II. Olaf Engelbrektsson again tried to lead a Catholic Norwegian resistance movement. Christian III triumphed and Engelbrektsson went into exile and, in 1536/1537, Christian demoted Norway from an independent kingdom to a puppet state.Derry pp.84-89 The Reformation was imposed in 1537, strengthening the king's power. All church valuables were sent to Copenhagen and the forty percent of the land which was owned by the church came under the control of the king. Danish was introduced as a written language, although Norwegian remained distinct dialects. Professional administration was now needed and power shifted from the provincial nobility to the royal administration: district stipendiary magistrates were appointed as judges and the sheriffs became employees of the crown rather than of the local nobility. In 1572, a governor-general was appointed for Norway with a seat at Akershus Fortress in Oslo. From the 1620s professional military officers were employed.Stenersen: 50 The 17th century saw a series of wars between Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Sweden. The Kalmar War between 1611‚Äì13 saw 8,000 Norwegian peasants conscripted. Despite lack of training, Denmark‚ÄìNorway won and Sweden abandoned its claims to the land between Tysfjord and Varangerfjord. With the Danish participation in the Thirty Years' War in 1618‚Äì48, a new conscription system was created in which the country was subdivided into 6,000 ledg, each required to support one soldier.Stenersen: 53 Denmark‚ÄìNorway lost the war and was forced to cede J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen to Sweden. The Second Northern War in 1657 to 1660 resulted in Bohusl√§n being ceded to Sweden. The Danish monarchy became an absolutist and hereditary one in Norway in 1661.Derry p. 100 A new administrative system was introduced. Departments organized by portfolio were established in Copenhagen, while Norway was divided into counties, each led by a district governor, and further subdivided into bailiwicks. About 1,600 government officials were appointed throughout the country.Stenersen: 56 Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenl√∏ve was the most famous viceroy of Norway (1664-1699).Derry p.102 Battle of Alv√∏en between the frigate and Norwegian gunboats near Bergen in 1808 The population of Norway increased from 150,000 in 1500 to 900,000 in 1800. By 1500 most deserted farms were repossessed. The period under absolutism increased the ratio of self- owning farmers from twenty to fifty percent, largely through sales of crown land to finance the lost wars. Crofts became common in the absolutism period, especially in Eastern Norway and Tr√∏ndelag, with the smallholder living at the mercy of the farmer.Stenersen: 57 There were 48,000 smallholders in 1800. Compared to Denmark, taxes were very low in Norway, typically at four to ten percent of the harvest, although the number of farms per legd decreased from four to two in the 1670s. Confirmation was introduced in 1736; as it required people to read, elementary education was introduced.Stenersen: 58 The Norwegian economy improved with the introduction of the water-driven saw in the early 16th century. Norway had huge resources of timber but did not have the means to exploit much of it in the Middle Ages as only hand-tools were available. The new saw mills which sprang up in the fjords changed this. In 1544 a deal was struck with the Netherlands (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and the Dutch controlled the export of Norwegian timber for the next 150 years. Amsterdam was built on piles from Norway. Tree-felling was done in the winter when farm-work was impossible and it was easy to get the felled trees across the snow to the rivers. In the spring, the logs floated down the rivers to the saw mills by the sea.Derry pp.91-92 By the mid-16th century the power of the Hanseatic League in Bergen was broken; though German craftsmen remained, they had to accept Danish rule.Derry pp.92-93 Many Norwegians earned a living as sailors in foreign ships, especially Dutch ones. The crews in both sides of the Anglo-Dutch Wars contained Norwegians.Derry pp.104-105 Norway benefitted from the many European wars of the 18th century. As a neutral power it was able to expand its share of the shipping market. It also supplied timber to foreign navies.Derry p.114 The entire period saw mercantilism as the basis for commerce, which involved import regulations and tariffs, monopolies and privileges throughout the county granted to burghers. The lumber industry became important in the 17th century through exports especially to England.Stenersen: 59 To avoid deforestation, a royal decree closed a large number of sawmills in 1688; because this mostly affected farmers with small mills, by the mid 18th century only a handful of merchants controlled the entire lumber industry.Stenersen: 60 Mining increased in the 17th century, the largest being the silver mines in Kongsberg and the copper mines in R√∏ros. Fishing continued to be an important income for farmers along the coast, but from the 18th century dried cod started being salted, which required fishermen to buy salt from merchants. The first important period of Norwegian shipping was between 1690 and 1710, but the advantage was lost with Denmark‚ÄìNorway entering the Great Northern War in 1709. However, Norwegian shipping regained its strength towards the end of the century.Stenersen: 61 Throughout the period, Bergen was the largest town in the country; its population of 14,000 in the mid 18th century was twice the size of Christiania (later Oslo) and Trondheim combined. Eight townships with privileges existed in 1660‚Äîby 1800 this had increased to twenty-three. During this period up to two-thirds of the country's audited national income was transferred to Copenhagen.Stenersen: 62 In the last decades of the century, Hans Nielsen Hauge started the Haugean movement, which demanded the right to preach the word of God freely.Stenersen: 64 The University of Oslo was established in 1811.Thuesen: 177 Union with Sweden The Constituent Assembly which approved the Constitution of Norway Denmark‚ÄìNorway entered the Napoleonic Wars on France's side in 1807. This had a devastating effect on the Norwegian economy as the Royal Navy hindered export by ship and import of food. Sweden invaded Norway the following year, but after several Norwegian victories a cease-fire was signed in 1809.Stenersen: 68 After pressure from Norwegian merchants license trade was permitted with corn from Denmark to Eastern Norway in exchange for Norwegian timber export to Great Britain.Stenersen: 69 Following the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, the Treaty of Kiel signed on 14 January 1814 ceded Norway to the king of Sweden.Stenersen: 71 Christian Frederik, heir to the Danish and Norwegian crowns, had since 1813 been governor-general of Norway. He spearheaded the Norwegian resistance against the Kiel Treaty and planned to claim the throne as the legitimate heir. He traveled to Trondheim to gain support for his person, and then assembled twenty-one prominent citizens at Eidsvoll on 16 February 1814 to discuss his plans. They rejected a new absolute monarchy and advised him instead to convoke a constituent assembly to draw up a liberal constitution and decide the form of government. Representatives from the entire country were elected to meet at Eidsvoll.Stenersen: 72 The 112 members of the Constituent Assembly gathered and, after six weeks of discussion, concluded the work on the Constitution of Norway on 17 May 1814. Power would be split between the king ‚Äî a position to which Christian Frederik was appointed ‚Äî and the Parliament of Norway.Stenersen: 74 The Swedish army under Crown prince Carl Johan of Sweden invaded Norway in late July; at the armistice Convention of Moss on 14 August Norway accepted to enter a personal union with Sweden on equal terms, while Sweden accepted the Norwegian Constitution and separate institutions in both states. King Christian Frederik agreed to convoke an extraordinary parliament to revise the Constitution accordingly, and then abdicate. The parliament was convened in Christiania on 7 October, and the necessary amendments were resolved on 4 November 1814. On the same day, king Charles XIII of Sweden was elected king of Norway, thereby establishing the Union.Stenersen: 75 Harvesting oats at Fossum in J√∏lster during the 1880s The Napoleonic Wars sent Norway into an economic crisis, as nearly all the merchants had gone bankrupt during the blockade. Recovery was difficult because of export tariffs and the country experienced high inflation. The Norwegian speciedaler was established as a currency by the Bank of Norway when it was established in 1816, financed through a silver tax which lasted until 1842.Stenersen: 77 Under threat of a coup d'√©tat by Carl Johan, Norway reluctantly paid the debt stated in the Treaty of Kiel, despite never having ratified it. Constitution Day on 17 May became an important political rally every year;Stenersen: 78 in 1829 the Swedish governor-general Baltzar von Platen resigned after he used force against demonstrators in the Battle of the Square.Stenersen: 79 The first half of the century was dominated by the ca. 2,000 officials,Stenersen: 80 as there were few bourgeois and no aristocracy following an 1821 decision to abolish nobility. From the 1832 election, farmers became more conscious of electing themselves, resulting in a majority of farmers in Parliament. This resulted in rural tax cuts and higher import tariffs, shifting the tax burden to the cities.Stenersen: 81 They also passed the Local Committees Act, which established elected municipal councils from 1838.Stenersen: 82 Cultural expression from the 1840s to the 1870s was dominated by the romantic nationalism, which emphasized the uniqueness of Norway. R√∏ros, a major copper mining town, in 1869 The textile industry started in the 1840s, which was followed up with mechanical workshops to build new machinery as the British embargo hindered import of textile machinery.Stenersen: 84 An economic crisis hit the country from 1848, resulting in Marcus Thrane establishing the first trade unions and demanding that quality for the law independent of social class. Parliament passed a series of laws abandoning economic privileges and easing domestic trade during the 1840s and 1850s.Stenersen: 85 Population increase forced the clearing of new land, although some of the growth came in the cities. The population of Christiania reached 40,000 in 1855.Stenersen: 83 By 1865 the population reached 1.7 million; the large increase was largely caused by better nutrition from herring and potatoes, a sharp decrease of infant mortality and increased hygiene. Emigration to North America started in 1825, with the first mass emigration commencing in the 1860s. By 1930, 800,000 people had emigrated, the majority settling in the Midwestern United States. Bridal Journey in Hardanger by Adolph Tidemand and Hans Gude, an example of romantic nationalism The population decrease resulted in a labor shortage in the agriculture, which again resulted in increased use of machinery and thus capital. The government stimulated the process through the creation of the Mortgage Bank in 1851 and the State Agricultural College eight years later.Stenersen: 89 The 19th century saw a large increase of road construction and steamship services commenced along the coast. The first railway, the Trunk Line between Christiania and Eidsvoll opened in 1854, followed a year later by the first telegraph line. Export industry commenced with steam-powered sawmills in the 1860s, followed by canned herring, wood pulp and cellulose. From 1850 to 1880 the Norwegian shipping industry enjoyed a large boom, stimulated by the abolishing of the British Navigation Acts. By 1880 there were 60,000 Norwegian seamen and the country had the world's third-largest merchant marine.Stenersen: 86 As the first coast-to-coast railway, the R√∏ros Line connected the capital to Trondheim in 1877. Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union in 1875 and introduced the Norwegian krone with a gold standard, along with the metric system being introduced.Thuesen: 224 The R√∏ros Line through Holt√•len in 1877 Annual parliamentary sessions were introduced from 1869 and in 1872 ministers were, though a constitutional amendment, required to meet in Parliament to defend their policies. The king, despite having no constitutional right to do so, vetoed the amendment in three successive parliaments. The 1882 election saw the first two parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, run for election, and subsequently the majority succeeded at impeaching the cabinet.Stenersen: 90 In 1884 the king appointed majority leader Johan Sverdrup as prime minister, thus establishing parliamentarism as the first European country.Stenersen: 91 The Liberal Party introduced a series of legal reforms, such as increasing the voting rights to about half of all men, settling the language conflict by establishing two official written standards, Riksm√•l and Landsm√•l, introduced juries, seven years of compulsory education and,Stenersen: 92 as the first European country, universal suffrage for men in 1889.Stenersen: 95 The 1880s and 1890s saw the rise of the labor movement and trade unions became common; the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions was established in 1899 and the Norwegian Employers' Confederation the following year. The Labor Party had its first parliamentary members elected in 1903. The women's issue became increasingly dominant through the 1880s and they were gradually permitted to take secondary and tertiary education.Stenersen: 93 Norwegian support of the union decreased towards the end of the 1890s, especially following the 1897 Swedish abolition of the free trade agreement and the lack of a Norwegian foreign minister. Negotiations of independence commenced, but were not effective because of shifting governments and the Swedish threat of war. Independence Industry along Akerselva in Oslo in 1912 With the four-party Michelsen's Cabinet appointed in 1905, Parliament voted to establish a Norwegian consular service. This was rejected by the king and on 7 June Parliament unanimously approved the dissolution of the union. In the following dissolution referendum, only 184 people voted in favor of a union. The government offered the Norwegian crown to Denmark's Prince Carl, who after a plebiscite became Haakon VII.Stenersen: 97 The following ten years, Parliament passed a series of social reforms, such as sick pay, factory inspection, a ten-hour working day and worker protection laws. Waterfalls for hydroelectricity became an important resource in this period and the government secured laws to hinder foreigners from controlling waterfalls, mines and forests.Stenersen: 100 Large industrial companies established in these years were Elkem,Thuesen: 248 Norsk Hydro and Sydvaranger.Thuesen: 252 The Bergen Line was completed in 1909, the Norwegian Institute of Technology was established the following yearThuesen: 258 and women's suffrage was introduced in 1913‚Äîas the second country in the world. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Norwegians carried out a series of polar expeditions. The most important explorers were Fridtjof Nansen, Roald Amundsen and Otto Sverdrup. Amundsen's expedition in 1911 became the first to reach the South Pole. Roald Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Sverre Hassel and Oscar Wisting (l‚Äìr) at Polheim, the tent erected at the South Pole on 16 December 1911 as the first expedition Norway adopted a policy of neutrality from 1905; during World War I the Norwegian merchant marine was largely used in support of the British, resulting in Norway being classified as The Neutral Ally. Half the Norwegian fleet was sunk and 2,000 seamen were killed by the German Atlantic U-boat Campaign. Some merchants made huge profits from trade and shipping during the war,Stenersen: 101 resulting in an increased division between the classes.Stenersen: 102 The interwar period was dominated by economic instability caused among other by strikes, lock-outs and the monetary policy causing deflation to compensate for too much money having been issued during the war and thus hindering investments.Stenersen: 103 Especially fishermen were hit hard in the period, while farmers retained market prices through organizing regulations. Unemployment peaked at ten percent between 1931 and 1933.Stenersen: 104 Although industrial production increased by eighty percent from 1915 to 1939, the number of jobs remained stable.Stenersen: 106 The Norwegian School of Economics was established in 1936.Thuesen: 300 Norway had nine governments between 1918 and 1935, nearly all minority and lasting an average eighteen months. The Agrarian Party was established in 1920, although this period saw a rise of support for the Conservatives.Stenersen: 107 The Labor Party split in 1921, with the left wing establishing the Communist Party.Stenersen: 110 Although strong during the 1920s, they were marginalized through the 1930s. A short-lived Labor Government reigned in 1928,Stenersen: 111 but did not establish a sound parliamentary support until the 1935 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet, based on an alliance with the Agrarian Party.Stenersen: 113 During the 1920s and 1930s, Norway established three dependencies, Bouvet√∏ya, Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land, annexed Jan Mayen and secured sovereignty of Svalbard through the Svalbard Treaty.Stenersen: 116 Norway's first civil airport, Stavanger, opened in 1937. World War II Scenes from the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 From the start of World War II in 1939, Norway maintained a strict neutrality.Stenersen: 117 Both Britain and Germany realized the strategic location; both made plans to invade Norway, regardless of Norwegian opposition. The Germans struck first and attacked Norway on April 9, 1940. After furious battles with the Norwegians and British forces, Germany prevailed and controlled Norway until the end of the war. The German goal was to use Norway to control access to the North Sea and the Atlantic, and to station air and naval forces to stop convoys from Britain to the USSR. Government in exile The government in exile, including the royal family, escaped to London. Politics were suspended and the government coordinated action with the Allies, retained control of a worldwide diplomatic and consular service, and operated the huge Norwegian merchant marine. It organized and supervised the resistance within Norway. One long-term impact was the abandonment of a traditional Scandinavian policy of neutrality; Norway became a founding member of NATO in 1949.Erik J. Friis, \\"The Norwegian Government-In-Exile, 1940-45\\" in Scandinavian Studies. Essays Presented to Dr. Henry Goddard Leach on the Occasion of his Eighty-fifth Birthday (1965), p422-444. Norway at the start of the war had the world's fourth largest merchant fleet, at 4.8 million tons, including a fifth of the world's oil tankers. The Germans captured about 20% of the fleet but the remainder, about 1000 ships, were taken over by the government. Although half the ships were sunk, the earnings paid the expenses of the government.I.C.B Dear and M.R.D. Foot, Oxford Companion to World War II (1995) pp 818-23Johs Andenaes, Norway and the Second World War (1966) Quisling regime Vidkun Quisling proclaimed himself prime minister and appointed a government with members from the National Unity Party.Stenersen: 121 He was quickly set aside and replaced by Josef Terboven, but reinstated in 1942. The Norwegian Campaign continued in Northern Norway and the government fled to London on 7 June.Stenersen: 122 The German occupation resulted in a brutalization of society and 30,000 people were imprisoned.Stenersen: 124 55,000 people joined the National Unity Party, which became the only legal party. But the nazification process failed after the Supreme Court resigned and both organized sports and bishops boycotted the new regime.Stenersen: 125 A resistance movement was established and was coordinated from London from 1943.Stenersen: 127 Stokker reports that hostile humour against the Germans helped maintain morale and build a wall against collaboration. Jokes made the rounds dripping with contempt for the oppressors, ridicule of Nazi ideology, stressing the cruelty of the Nazis and mocking their inflated self-image. People on the street asked, \\"Do you know the difference between the Nazis and a bucket of manure? The bucket.\\" In Post Office lines they explained, \\"It's rumored that we're getting new stamps bearing Quisling's likeness, but distribution has been delayed because no one knows which side to spit on.\\" The jokes worked to educate Norwegians about the occupation, and encourage a sense of solidarity.Kathleen Stokker, \\"Heil Hitler; God Save the King: Jokes and the Norwegian Resistance 1940-1945,\\" Western Folklore (1991) 50#2 pp. 171-190 in JSTOR At the time of German surrender on 8 May 1945, there were 360,000 German soldiers in the country.Stenersen: 130 Postwar 1945-1950 A legal purge took place in Norway after WWII in which 53,000 people were sentenced for treason and 25 were executed. The post-war years saw an increased interest in Scandinavism, resulting in Scandinavian Airlines System in 1946, the Nordic Council in 1952Stenersen: 143 and the Nordic Passport Union along with the metric system being introduced. Reconstruction after the war gave Norway the highest economic growth in Europe until 1950, partly created through rationing private consumption allowing for higher industrial investments. The Labor Party retained power throughout the period and maintained a policy of public planning.Stenersen: 134 The University of Bergen was created in 1946.Thuesen: 335 The 1950s saw a boom in construction of hydroelectricityStenersen: 137 and the state built the steel mill Norsk Jernverk and two aluminum works.Stenersen: 135 State banks such as the State Housing Bank, the State Educational Loan Fund and Postbanken allowed for governmental control over private debt. Oslo hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics.Stenersen: 138 Norway retained its neutrality policy until 1947, focusing on its membership in the United Nations,Stenersen: 140 where Trygve Lie had become the first secretary- general.Thuesen: 334 However, there was no enthusiasm for the UN at the time. Anti-communism grew with a Soviet proposal for joint control over Svalbard and especially after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, after which the Communist Party lost all influence. Norway started negotiations for the creation of a Scandinavian defense union, but instead opted to become a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). However, Norway never allowed permanently stationed foreign troops or nuclear weapons on Norwegian soil to avoid agitating the Soviet Union, with which Norway from 1944 shared a land border.Stenersen: 141 NATO financed large parts of the Norwegian military investments, which ultimately resulted in numerous airports being built during the 1950s and 1960s.Malm√∏: 66 Marshall Plan Norway joined the Marshall Plan (\\"ERP\\") in 1947, receiving US$400 million in American support. Given the business background of the Marshall Plan's American leaders, their readiness to work with the Norwegian Labor government's ERP Council disappointed the conservative Norwegian business community. It was represented by the major business organizations, the Norges Industriforbund and the Norsk Arbeidsgiverforening. While reluctant to work with the government, Norwegian business leaders also recognized the dangers of appearing to obstruct the implementation of the Marshall Plan. American acceptance of a role for government in economic planning reflected their New Deal reformist orientation. The opportunities for mediation between conservative Norwegian business interests and the government that arose in the course of administering the Marshall Plan helped establish a base for the emergence of Norwegian corporatism in the 1950s.Kai R.

Issn: 0346-8755  1950 to 1972  Trondheim in 1965 The sale of cars was deregulated in October 1960, and in the same year the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation introduced Norway's first television broadcasts.Stenersen: 145 Norway feared competition from Swedish industry and Danish agriculture and chose not to join any free trade organizations until 1960, when it joined the European Free Trade Association.Stenersen: 142 Throughout the post-war period both fishing and agriculture became more mechanized, the agricultural subsidies rose to the third-highest in the world and the number of small-scale farms and fishermen fell dramatically.Stenersen: 148 The Socialist People's Party was created in 1961 by former Labor politicians who disagreed with the Labor Party's NATO, nuclear and European policies. Following the Kings Bay Affair the right-wing Lyng's Cabinet ruled for a month.Stenersen: 146 The right-wing coalition Borten's Cabinet won the 1965 election, sat for six years and started a trend of shifting Labor and right-wing governments.Stenersen: 147 Norwegianization of Samis halted after the war and Sami rights became an increasing issue, with a council being established in 1964.Stenersen: 163 The completion of the Nordland Line to Bod√∏ in 1962 concluded the construction of new railway routes, while the first part of the Oslo Metro opened in 1966.Thuesen: 370 A social security net was gradually introduced after the war, with child allowances introduced in 1946 and the Social Care Act introduced in 1964. The 1960s saw good times for heavy industry and Norway became Europe's largest exporter of aluminum and the world's largest exporter of ferroalloys. The University of Trondheim and the University of Troms√∏ both opened in 1968, one year before a network of regional colleges started being opened. Influenced by American culture and similar actions abroad, youth and students started an uproar against cultural norms.Stenersen: 149 The 1960s saw an increased focus on environmentalism, especially through activism, based on ever-more conversion of waterfalls to hydro stations, pollution and the dilapidation of herring stocks. Rondane National Park was created as the country's first in 1962 and the Ministry of the Environment was the first in the world when it was established in 1972.Stenersen: 151 A network of regional airports were built in Western and Northern Norway in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Malm√∏: 67 Membership in the European Economic Community was rejected in a 1972 referendum.Stenersen: 152 Oil Age Statfjord oil platform Prospecting in the North Sea started in 1966 and in 1969 Phillips Petroleum found oil in the Ekofisk field‚Äîwhich proved to be among the ten largest fields in the world. Operations of the fields was split between foreign operators, the state-owned Statoil, the partially state-owned Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum. Ekofisk experienced a major blowout in 1977 and 123 people were killed when the Alexander Kielland accommodation rig capsized in 1980;Stenersen: 155 these incidents led to a strengthening of petroleum safety regulations. The oil industry not only created jobs in production, but a large number of supply and technology companies were established. Stavanger became the center of this industry. High petroleum taxes and dividends from Statoil gave high income from the oil industry to the government.Stenersen: 156 Norway established its exclusive economic zone in the 1970s, receiving an area of . A series of border disputes followed; agreements were reached with Denmark and Iceland in the 1990s,Stenersen: 158 but the border in the Barents Sea was not agreed upon until 2010. Between 1973 and 1981 the country was ruled by the Labor Party, who carried out a series of reforms such as new school system. Farmers received increased subsidies and from 1974 women were permitted to inherit farms. Abortion on demand was legalized in 1978.Stenersen: 159 Loans guaranteed in future oil income allowed Norway to avoid a recession during the mid-1970s. But by 1977 high wages had made Norwegian industry uncompetitive and a soaring forced cut-backs in public and private spending.Stenersen: 162 Fish farming became a new, profitable industry along the coast.Stenersen: 173 Alta Power Station, built despite massive protests An immigration surplus was established in the late 1960s, largely from Western Europe and the United States‚Äîfrom the 1970s increasingly expertise in oil. The period also saw an increased immigration of unskilled labor from developing countries, especially Pakistan, although regulations from 1975 slowed this significantly. Oslo became the center-point of immigration. The Alta controversy started in the 1970s when Statkraft planned to dam the Alta River. The case united the environmental and Sami interest groups; although Alta Power Station was built, the issue shifted the political climate and made large-scale hydroelectricity project difficult to built. The Sami Parliament was established in 1989.Stenersen: 164 The Conservative Party won the 1981 elections and carried out a large deregulation reform: taxes were cut, local private radio stations were permitted, cable television was established by private companies, regulations on borrowing money were removed and foreigners were permitted to buy securities. An economic crisis hit in 1986 when foreigners started selling Norwegian krone, which ultimately forced an increase in taxes and Prime Minister K√•re Willoch was forced to resign.Stenersen: 165 The Progress Party, located to the right of the Conservatives, had its break-through in the late 1980s.Stenersen: 167 The high wages in the oil industry made low-skill manufacturing industries uncompetitive and the Labor Party closed a number of public industrial companies which were receiving large subsidies.Stenersen: 168 The 1980s saw a trebling of people on disability, largely amongst the oldest in the workforce. Crime rates rose.Stenersen: 171 The subsea Vard√∏ Tunnel opened in 1982Thuesen: 394 and since the country has built subsea tunnels to connect island communities to the mainland.

Norsk Data, a manufacturer of minicomputers, became Norway's second largest company by 1985,Steine: 16 just to go bankrupt by 1993. Unemployment reached record-high levels in the early 1990s.Stenersen: 174 By 1990, Norway was Europe's largest oil producer and by 1995 it was the world's second-largest oil exporter. Membership in the European Union was rejected in a 1994 referendum, with Norway instead joining the European Economic AreaStenersen: 172 and later also the Schengen Area.Stenersen: 175 Large public investments in the 1990s were a new National Hospital and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen‚Äîconnected to the capital with Norway's first high-speed railway, the Gardermoen Line. A number of large government companies, such as Statoil, Telenor and Kongsberg were privatized. Lillehammer hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. The end of the Cold War resulted in cooperation with Russia and reduced military activity.Stenersen: 176 21st century Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik met with U.S. President George W.

It is the most populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011. The encompassing urban agglomeration population is around 1.68 million. Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is a major Information Technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's software exports as of 2016. Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi as the \\"Evergreen city of India\\", the city is characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills. The present regions that constitute Thiruvananthapuram were ruled by the Ays until their fall in the 10th century. The city was then taken over by the Chera dynasty. In the 12th Century, It was taken over by the Kingdom of Venad. In the 17th century the king Marthanda Varma expanded the territory and founded the princely state of Travancore and made Thiruvananthapuram its capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Travancore-Cochin state and remained so till the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956. Thiruvananthapuram is a notable academic and research hub and home to the University of Kerala, Kerala Technological University, the regional headquarters of Indira Gandhi National Open University, and many other schools and colleges. Thiruvananthapuram is also home to research centers such as the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Indian Space Research Organisation's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, National Centre for Earth Science Studies and a campus of the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research. The city is home to media institutions like Toonz India Ltd and Tata Elxsi Ltd, and is also home to Chitranjali Film Studio, one of the first film studios in Malayalam Cinema, and Kinfra Film and Video Park at Kazhakoottom, which is India's first Infotainment industrial park.

Thiruvananthapuram is a major tourist centre, known for the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, the beaches of Kovalam and Varkala, the backwaters of Poovar and Anchuthengu and its Western Ghats tracts of Ponmudi and the Agastyamala. In 2012, Thiruvananthapuram was named the best Kerala city to live in, by a field survey conducted by The Times of India. In 2013, the city was ranked the fifteenth best city to live in India, in a survey conducted by India Today. Thiruvananthapuram was ranked the best Indian city for two consecutive years, 2015 and 2016, according to the Annual Survey of India's City-Systems (ASICS) conducted by the Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy. The city was also selected as the best governed city in India in a survey conducted by Janaagraha Centre for citizenship and democracy in 2017.  Etymology  The city takes its name from the Malayalam word thiru-anantha- puram , meaning \\"The City of Lord Ananta\\", referring to the deity of the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple located in the city. Thiruvananthapuram is also known in the literature, and popular reference as Ananthapuri derived from the Sanskrit word Syanandurapuram, meaning \\"The City of Bliss\\" in Carnatic kirtanas composed by Swathi Thirunal, erstwhile Maharaja of Travancore. The city was officially referred to as Trivandrum until 1991 (Trivandrum being the anglicised name of the town), when the government decided to reinstate the city's original name Thiruvananthapuram.  History  Painting by Raja Ravi Varma depicting Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos being greeted by Visakham Thirunal, with Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore looking on, during Buckingham's visit to Thiruvananthapuram in early 1880 Padmanabhaswamy Temple is the richest temple in the world. The rulers of Travancore ruled the kingdom as the servants of Sri. Padmanabha Thiruvananthapuram is an ancient region with trading traditions dating back to 1000 BCE.De Beth Hillel, David (1832). Travels (Madras publication).Lord, James Henry (1977). The Jews in India and the Far East; Greenwood Press Reprint; . It is believed that the ships of King Solomon landed in a port called Ophir (now Poovar) in Thiruvananthapuram in 1036 BCE. The city was the trading post of spices, sandalwood and ivory. However, the ancient political and cultural history of the city was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of Kerala. The early rulers of the city were the Ays. Vizhinjam, which is now a region in the present-day Thiruvananthapuram, was the capital of the Ay dynasty. Vizhinjam was an important port city from as early as 2nd century BC. During the Ay dynasty rule, Thiruvananthapuram witnessed many battles in which the Chola and Pandyan dynasties attempted to capture the port town. After the death of king Vikramaditya Varaguna in 925 AD, the glory of the Ays departed and almost all their territories became part of the Chera dynasty. During the 10th century, the Cholas attacked and sacked Vizhinjam and surrounding regions. The port in Vizhinjam and the historic education center of Kanthalloor Sala were also destroyed by Cholas during this period. A branch of the Ay family, which had been controlling the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, merged with the Kingdom of Venad in the 12th century. In the late 17th century, Marthanda Varma who inherited the Kingdom of Venad expanded the kingdom by conquering the kingdoms of Attingal, Kollam, Kayamkulam, Kottarakara, Kottayam, Changanassery, Meenachil, Poonjar and Ambalapuzha. In 1729, Marthanda Varma founded the princely state of Thiruvithamkoor and Thiruvananthapuram was made the capital in 1745 after shifting the capital from Padmanabhapuram in Kanyakumari district. The kingdom of Travancore was dedicated by Marthanda Varma to the deity Sri. Padmanabha (Lord Vishnu). The rulers of Travancore ruled the kingdom as the servants of Sri. Padmanabha. The city developed into a significant intellectual and artistic centre during this period. The city's golden age was during the mid-19th century under the reign of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal and Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal. This era saw the establishment of the first English school (1834), the Observatory (1837), the General Hospital (1839), the Oriental Research Institute & Manuscripts Library and the University College (1873). The first mental hospital in the state was started during the same period. Sanskrit College, Ayurveda College, Law College and a second-grade college for women were started by Moolam Thirunal (1885‚Äì1924). The early 20th century was an age of tremendous political and social changes in the city. The Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, established in 1904, was the first democratically elected legislative council in any Indian state. Despite not being under the direct control of the British Empire at any time, the city featured prominently in India's freedom struggle. The Indian National Congress had a very active presence in Thiruvananthapuram. A meeting of the Indian National Congress presided by Dr Pattabhi Sitaramaiah was held here in 1938. Kowdiar Palace built-in 1915 was the official residence of the Travancore Royal Family. The Thiruvananthapuram Municipality came into existence in 1920. The municipality was converted into a corporation on 30 October 1940, during the period of Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma, who took over in 1931. The city witnessed multi-faceted progress during his period. The promulgation of \\"Temple Entry Proclamation\\" (1936) was an act that underlined social emancipation. This era also saw the establishment of the University of Travancore in 1937, which later became Kerala University. With the end of the British rule in 1947, Travancore chose to join the Indian union. The first popularly elected ministry, headed by Pattom Thanu Pillai, was installed in office on 24 March 1948. In 1949, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Thiru-Kochi, the state formed by the integration of Travancore with its northern neighbour, the Kochi. The king of Travancore, Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma, became the Rajpramukh of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1 July 1949 until 31 October 1956. When the state of Kerala was formed on 1 November 1956, Thiruvananthapuram became its capital. With the establishment of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1962, Thiruvananthapuram became the cradle of India's ambitious space programme. The first Indian space rocket was developed and launched from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in the outskirts of the city in 1963. Several establishments of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) were later established in Thiruvananthapuram. A significant milestone in the city's recent history was the establishment of Technopark‚ÄîIndia's first IT park‚Äîin 1995. Technopark has developed into the largest IT park in the geographical area, employing around 62,000 people in 450 companies.

It is the capital of the Province of Taranto and is an important commercial port as well as the main Italian naval base. Taranto was founded by the Spartans in the 8th century BC. During the period of Greek colonization on the coasts of Southern Italy, the city was among the most important in Magna Graecia and it became a cultural, economic and military power, which gave birth to philosophers, strategists, writers and athletes, such as Archytas, Aristoxenus, Livius Andronicus, Heracleides, Iccus, Cleinias, Leonidas, Lysis, and Sosibius. The seven-year rule of Archytas marked the apex of Taranto's development and the recognition of its hegemony over the other Greek colonies of southern Italy. During the Norman period, it became the capital of the Principality of Taranto, which covered almost all of the heel of Apulia. From the name of the city derives that of the species Lycosa tarantula, which originated the terms tarantella, tarantism and tarantula. Taranto is also known for the large population of dolphins and other cetaceans that historically live near the Cheradi Islands, located in front of the city. It is the third-largest continental city in southern Italy and an important commercial and naval port with well-developed steel and iron foundries, oil refineries, chemical works, naval shipyards, and food-processing factories. Around 500 BC the city was one of the largest in the world with population estimates up to 300,000 people. Overview Taranto naval base for the Italian Regia Marina's First Squadron, 1930s Taranto's pre-history dates back to 706 BC when it was founded as a Greek colony, established by the Spartans. The ancient city was situated on a peninsula; the modern city has been built over the ancient Greek city of which only a few ruins remain, including part of the city wall, two temple columns dating to the 6th century BC, and tombs. The Greek colonists from Sparta called the city Taras (; GEN Tarantos) after the mythical hero Taras, while the Romans, who connected the city to Rome with an extension of the Appian way, called it Tarentum. The islets of S. Pietro and S. Paolo (St. Peter and St. Paul), collectively known as Cheradi Islands, protect the bay, called Mar Grande (Big Sea), where the commercial port is located. Another bay, called Mar Piccolo (Little Sea), is formed by the peninsula of the old city and has flourishing fishing. At the end of the 19th century, a channel was excavated to allow naval ships to enter the Mar Piccolo harbour, and the ancient Greek city become an island connected to the mainland by bridges. The islets and the coast are strongly fortified and Mar Piccolo is a naval port with strategic importance. Because of the presence of these two bays, Taranto is also called \\"the city of the two seas\\". The comune of Taranto (red) within its province. The natural harbor at Taranto made it a logical home port for the Italian naval fleet before and during the First World War. During World War II, Taranto became famous for a November 1940 British air attack on the Regia Marina naval base stationed here, which today is called the Battle of Taranto. Taranto is also the origin of the common name of the Tarantula spider family, Theraphosidae, even though strictly speaking there are no members of Theraphosidae in the area. In ancient times, residents of the town of Taranto, upon being bitten by the large local Wolf Spider, Lycosa tarentula, would promptly do a long vigorous dance like a jig. This was done in order to sweat the venom out of their pores, even though the spider's venom was not fatal to humans. The frenetic dance became known as the Tarantella. In geology, Taranto gives its name to the Tarantian Age of the Pleistocene Epoch. Physical geography Taranto & harbor from ISS, 2017 Taranto faces the Ionian Sea. It is above sea level. It was built on a plain running north/north-west‚Äìsoutheast, and surrounded by the Murgia plateau from the north-west to the east. Its territory extends for and is mostly underwater. It is characterised by three natural peninsulas and a man-made island, formed by digging a ditch during the construction of Aragon Castle. The city is known as the \\"city of two seas\\" because it is washed by the Big Sea in the bay between Punta Rondinella to the northwest and Capo San Dante to the south, and by the vast reservoir of the Little Sea. Big Sea and Little Sea The view of the Little Sea from the Appian Way The Big Sea is frequently known as the Big Sea bay as that is where ships harbour. It is separated from the Little Sea by a cape which closes the gulf, leading to the artificial island. This island formed the heart of the original city and it is connected to the mainland by the Ponte di Porta Napoli and the Ponte Girevole. The Big Sea is separated from the Ionian Sea by the Capo San Vito, the Isole Cheradi of St Peter and St Paul, and the three islands of San Nicolicchio, which are completely incorporated by the steel plant. The latter form a little archipelago which closes off the arc creating the natural Big Sea bay. The Little Sea is considered to be a lagoon so it presents problems of water exchange. It is virtually divided into two by the Ponte Punta Penna Pizzone, which joins the Punta Penna to the Punta Pizzone. The first of these forms a rough triangle, whose corners are the opening to the east and the Porta Napoli channel linking it to the Big Sea in the west. The second half forms an ellipse whose major axis measures almost from the south-west to the north-east. The Galeso river flows into the first half. The two water bodies have slightly different winds and tides and their underwater springs have different salinities. These affect the currents on the surface and in the depths of the Big Sea and the two halves of the Little Sea. In the Big Sea and in the northern part of the Little Sea, there are some underwater springs called citri, which carry undrinkable freshwater together with salt water. This creates the ideal biological conditions for cultivating Mediterranean mussels, known locally as cozze. Climate The climate of the city, recorded by the weather station situated near the Grottaglie Military Airport, is typical of the Mediterranean with frequent continental features. The spring is usually mild and rainy, but it is not uncommon to have sudden cold spells from the north and east, which often cause snowfall. Average annual precipitation is fairly low (even for southern Italy), measuring just per year. The summer is hot and humid, with temperatures averaging . On 28 November 2012 a large F3 tornado hit the port of Taranto and damaged the Taranto Steel Mill where workers were protesting against the plant's pollution emissions; about 20 people were injured, and another man was reported missing. The tornado is one of nine to hit Italy since 1 October. It is classified as Geographical zone C and having a degree- day of 30. History Doric columns from the Temple of Poseidon in Taranto, legacy of its Greek origins. Taranto was founded in 706 BC by Dorian Greek immigrants hailing from Sparta, its origin are peculiar: the founders were Partheniae (\\"sons of virgins\\"), sons of unmarried Spartan women and Perioeci (free men, but not citizens of Sparta); these out-of-wedlock unions were permitted extraordinarily by the Spartans to increase the prospective number of soldiers (only the citizens of Sparta could become soldiers) during the bloody Messenian Wars, but later they were retroactively nullified, and the sons were then obliged to leave Greece forever. Phalanthus, the Parthenian leader, went to Delphi to consult the oracle: the puzzling answer designated the harbour of Taranto as the new home of the exiles. The Partheniae arrived in Apulia, and founded the city, naming it Taras after the son of the Greek sea god, Poseidon, and of a local nymph,. According to other sources, Heracles founded the city. Another tradition indicates Taras as the founder of the city; the symbol of the Greek city (as well as of the modern city) depicts the legend of Taras being saved from a shipwreck by riding a dolphin that was sent to him by Poseidon. Taranto increased its power, becoming a commercial power and a sovereign city of Magna Graecia, ruling over the Greek colonies in southern Italy. Its independence and power came to an end as the Romans expanded throughout Italy. Taranto won the first of two wars against Rome for the control of Southern Italy: it was helped by Pyrrhus, king of Greek Epirus, who surprised Rome with the use of war elephants in battle, a thing never seen before by the Romans. Rome won the second war in 272 BC. This subsequently cut off Taranto from the centre of Mediterranean trade, by connecting the Via Appia directly to the port of Brundisium (Brindisi). Ancient art Like many Greek city states, Taras issued its own coins in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The denomination was a Nomos, a die-cast silver coin whose weight, size and purity were controlled by the state. The highly artistic coins presented the symbol of the city, Taras being saved by a dolphin, with the reverse side showing the likeness of a hippocamp, a horse-fish amalgam which is depicted in mythology as the beast that drew Poseidon's chariot. Taras was also the centre of a thriving decorated Greek pottery industry during the 4th century BC. Most of the South Italian Greek vessels known as Basilican ware were made in different workshops in the city. Unfortunately, none of the names of the artists have survived, so modern scholars have been obliged to give the recognizable artistic hands and workshops nicknames based on the subject matter of their works, museums which possess the works, or individuals who have distinguished the works from others. Some of the most famous of the Apulian vase painters at Taras are now called: the Iliupersis Painter, the Lycurgus Painter, the Gioia del Colle Painter, the Darius Painter, the Underworld Painter, and the White Sakkos Painter, among others. The wares produced by these workshops were usually large elaborate vessels intended for mortuary use. The forms produced included volute kraters, loutrophoroi, paterai, oinochoai, lekythoi, fish plates, etc. The decoration of these vessels was red figure (with figures reserved in red clay fabric, while the background was covered in a black gloss), with overpainting (sovradipinto) in white, pink, yellow, and maroon slips. Often the style of the drawings is florid and frilly, as was already the fashion in 4th-century Athens. Distinctive South Italian features also begin to appear. Many figures are shown seated on rocks. Floral motifs become very ornate, including spiraling vines and leaves, roses, lilies, poppies, sprays of laurel, acanthus leaves. Often the subject matter consists of naiskos scenes (scenes showing the statue of a deceased person in a naos, a miniature temple or shrine). Most often the naiskos scene occupies one side of the vase, while a mythological scene occupies the other. Images depicting many of the Greek myths are only known from South Italian vases, since Athenian ones seem to have had more limited repertoires of depiction. World War II The Battle of Taranto took place on the night of 11‚Äì12 November 1940 during the Second World War between British naval forces, under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, and Italian naval forces, under Admiral Inigo Campioni. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft ship-to-ship naval attack in history, employing 21 obsolete Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea. The attack struck the battle fleet of the Regia Marina at anchor in the harbour of Taranto, using aerial torpedoes despite the shallowness of the water. 2006 municipal bankruptcy The Municipality of Taranto was declared bankrupt effective 31 December 2005, having accrued liabilities of ‚Ç¨637 million. This was one of the biggest financial crises which has ever hit a municipality. The bankruptcy declaration was made on 18 October 2006 by the receiver Tommaso Blonda. He was appointed following the resignation of the mayor, Rossana Di Bello, on account of her sixteen-month prison sentence for abuse of office and forgery of documents relating to investigations into the contract for the management of the city incinerator, awarded to Termomeccanica. Transport The two leaves of the 1887-built Ponte Girevole turning to open the waterway for a large ship Rail Taranto railway station connects the city with Rome, Naples, Milan, Bologna, Bari, Reggio di Calabria and Brindisi. Air Taranto-Grottaglie Airport is located 16 km away from Taranto, but does not offer any regularly schedules commercial services. The two closest airports that do offer regularly scheduled commercial services are in Brindisi and Bari, approximately 70 km and 90 km away, respectively. Other The Ponte Girevole (swing bridge), built in 1887, runs across the navigable ship canal that joins Mar Piccolo (Little Sea) with Mar Grande (Big Sea) and stretches along . When the bridge is open, the two ends of the city are disconnected. Environment In 1991 Taranto was declared a high environmental risk area by the Ministry of Environment. As a consequence of the pollutants discharged into the air by the factories in the area, most notably the ILVA steel plant, part of Gruppo Riva. 7% of Taranto's pollution is produced by the public; 93% is produced by factories. In 2005, the European Pollutant Emission Register estimated dioxin emissions from the Taranto ILVA plant were responsible for 83% of Italy's total reported emissions. Every year the city is exposed to of carbon monoxide and of carbon dioxide. In 2014, the Italian National Institute of Emissions and their Sources,Inventario nazionale delle emissioni e loro sorgenti (INES) stated that Taranto stands third in the world behind China's Linfen, and Cop≈üa MicƒÉ in Romania, the most polluted cities in the world due to factories' emissions. In particular, the city produces ninety-two percent of Italy's dioxin. This is 8.8 percent of the dioxin in Europe. Between 1995 and 2004, leukaemias, myelomas and lymphomas increased by 30 to 40 percent. Dioxin accumulates over the years. Over 9 kilos of dioxin have been discharged into the city's air by its factories. Grazing is banned within of the ILVA plant. In 2013, the ILVA plant was placed under special administration when its owner, the Riva family, was accused of failing to prevent toxic emissions, which caused at least 400 premature deaths. Emissions of both carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and dioxin have decreased. Animal species have returned that had left, including swallows, cranes, dolphins, seahorses and the coral reef. Main sites Palazzo del Governo facing the Lungomare, which was inaugurated in 1934 by Benito Mussolini Taranto has a number of sites of historic value. Situated at the angle of the canal, Big Sea and Piazza Castello, the Aragon Castle was built between 1486 and 1492 by orders of King Ferdinand II of Aragon to protect the city from the Turks' frequent raids.http://www.viaggareinpuglia.it/at/1/castellotorre/96/en/Taranto-Aragon-- Castle The castle, which was designed by Italian painter and architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini, replaced a pre-existing 9th-century Byzantine fortress, which was deemed unfit for 15th-century warfare. In 1707 it ceased to be used as a military fortress and was converted to a prison until under Napoleon Bonaparte it reverted to its original military function. To date it is the property of the Italian Navy and is open to the public. Twenty-first- century excavations revealed the castle's earlier Byzantine foundations which can be viewed. There are several Greek temple ruins - some from the 6th century BC - such as the remains of a temple dedicated to Poseidon, with its two surviving Doric columns still visible on Piazza Castello in the Citta Vecchia. The Promenade (lungomare), named after former Italian king Victor Emmanuel III, overlooks the Mar Grande, the natural harbour and commercial port. The Concattedrale Gran Madre di Dio, designed by Gio Ponti, was built in 1967‚Äì1971 in reinforced concrete and is one of the most significant late works by the architect. In 2018 it is in poor condition and defaced by graffiti.https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/gio-ponti-cathedral-taranto- italy In the modern districts, but above all in the central Borgo Umbertino, there are also the Fountain of the Rosa dei Venti, Monumento al Marinaio, the War Memorial and the Navy Yard, another symbol of the city, some archeological sites such as the Cripta del Redentore, churches like Maria Santissima del Monte Carmelo, San Pasquale and San Francesco di Paola and 18th- and 19th- century palaces such as Palazzo Magnini, Palazzo delle Poste, Palazzo del Governo, Palazzo degli Uffici and Palazzo Savino D'Amelio. On the outskirts and in the countryside there are several traditional ancient country houses called masseria, like Masseria Capitignano. Old Town Via Cava in Old Town. The painted red arched door of the old, multi-storied palazzo is an example of the street art that since 2013 became a feature of Old Town The Old Town or Citt√† Vecchia is where the Greeks built their acropolis. Today it retains the same street layout of 967, when the Byzantines under Nicephorus Phocas rebuilt what the Saracen troops led by the Slavic Sabir had razed to the ground in 927 AD. There are four main arteries (Corso Vittorio II, Via Duomo, Via di Mezzo and Via Garibaldi) which run in a straight direction however the side streets were purposely built narrow and winding to impede the passage of an invading army.Taranto - 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Incorporating the Aragon Castle, Doric Columns, City Hall, Clock Tower and Piazza Fontana, it is situated and entirely enclosed on the artificial island between the Big and Little Seas and is reached from the New Town by crossing the Ponte Girevole (swing bridge) from the south and the Ponte di Porta Napoli from the north. Almost rectangular in shape, it is divided into four pittaggi ( quarters) that are delineated by the cross formed between Via di Mezzo and postiliera Via Nuova. These are \\"Baglio\\" and \\"San Pietro\\" in the upper section which face the Big Sea; and \\"Turipenne\\" and \\"Ponte\\" in the lower part fronting the Little Sea. The nobility, clergy and military personnel made their homes in Baglio and San Pietro, whilst the artisans and fishermen dwelled in Ponte and Turipenne. An Armenian community was present in the 10th and 11th centuries having arrived in Taranto as troops in the Byzantine Army. The San't Andrea degli Armeni church in Piazza Monteoliveto, located in the Baglio quarter, stands as testimony to the neighbourhood where the Armenians made their homes. In 1746 the entire population of Taranto resided in Old Town. This resulted in the necessity of building additional stories on the narrow houses. It is still inhabited with a number of people living in juxtaposition to the old palazzi. By 2013 the population of the Old Town was just 1000\\"The Old Town of Taranto: Architectural Reading of the History Urban Form for the Correct Methodology for Restoration Project the Built Heritage in the Island\\".

Old derelict buildings in Via di Mezzo which forms the cross that divides the four pittagi There are a number of 17th and 18th-century palazzi in Old Town. For years, they served as the main residence of local aristocratic families and the clergy. These include Palazzo Cal√≤, Palazzo Carducci-Artenisio (1650), Palazzo Galeota (1728), Palazzo Gallo (17th century), Palazzo Latagliata, Palazzo Lo Jucco (1793), Palazzo D'Aquino, Palazzo Delli Ponti, Palazzo Gennarini, Palazzo d'Ayala, Palazzo Visconti, Palazzo Galizia, Palazzo Ciura and Palazzo Pantaleo. The 17th century de Beaumont-Bonelli-Bellacicco palace houses the Spartan Museum of Taranto - Hypogeum Bellacicco which extends below street and sea level to the hypogeum that is a crossroads with other hypogeum of Old Town which together form the system of subterranean Taranto. Churches include the San Cataldo Cathedral (10th century) in Piazza Duomo, San Domenico Maggiore (1302), Sant'Andrea degli Armeni (16th century), Sant'Agostino (1402), San Michele (1763), Sant'Anna, the Madonna della Salute sanctuary (1752), and San Giuseppe (16th century). Close to the San Agostino church, located near Pendio La Riccia, the buried remains of an ancient Greek temple were discovered. Beginning in 1934 Benito Mussolini embarked on a project of rejuvenation that involved the demolition of the working class Turipenne pittaggio along the Via Garibaldi and Discesa Vasto which contained the homes of local fishermen as well as the old Jewish quarter. The demolitions, which also razed the old medieval wall and three churches out of the four within the area, continued until the outbreak of World War II. Modern edifices and apartment blocks were erected to replace the demolished structures.Taranto, Archeologia, Storia, Architettura\\" In addition to the many palazzi, Old Town has myriad arched alleyways, saliti, vicoli and small streets, some of which are closed to traffic. Between 2013 and 2014 two Neapolitan urban artists Cyop and Kaf embarked on a project to decorate derelict buildings, walls and doors in the piazzi and vicoli with 120 representations of street art. It has since become a striking feature of Old Town which is described as the abandoned district of Taranto.\\"Street Art; un anno in Citt√† Vecchia\\". Corriere di Taranto.

As a result of the city's history, it is influenced by Greek, Vulgar Latin, French and many others. Sports * Taranto F.C. 1927 (Football)  Cuisine  Taranto's cuisine is characterised by local products, especially vegetables and fish like artichokes, eggplants, tomatoes, olives, onions, shrimps, octopus, sardines, squid and, above all, mussels. A very important role is also played by the olive oil and bread produced in the city and in all the villages of its province. Some PDO, PGI and PAT are made in the countryside of Taranto and in the villages around the city: among them we can find some extra-virgin olive oil like Terre Tarentine PDO and Terra d'Otranto PDO, fruits like Uva di Puglia PGI and Clementine del Golfo di Taranto PGI, vegetables like the Barattiere PAT, Pomodorino di Manduria PAT, types of cheese like Burrata di Andria PGI and Ricotta Forte PAT, a type of bread called Pane di Laterza PAT and the Capocollo di Martina Franca PAT, a type of capocollo.  Mussels of Taranto  Tarantinian mussels cooked in a pan A very important ingredient of the cuisine of Taranto is mussels. They are grown in the Big Sea and, above all, in the Little Sea (see above). They have been inserted in the list of Traditional Food Products by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies. The peculiar flavour of Tarantine mussels is given by the special conditions of salinity of the Little Sea which is crossed by the citri, submarine freshwater springs which manage to oxygenate the water, helping the development of the plankton and by the freshwater come from the Galeso river. The piles for the mussels were anciently made with wood from Sila Mountains in Calabria. During the Ancient Greek and Roman times, several authors described the richness and the goodness of the mussels of Taranto. After the tests about the pollution that is present in the first side of the Little Sea, the legal production of mussels has been moved to the second side. The tests and the classifications of the water are made by producers giving the possibility to certify the safety of the product. Some of the most traditional dishes of Taranto are mussels alla puppitegna (with garlic, extra-virgin olive oil and parsley) or the impepata (\\"full of pepper\\" in Italian) or spaghetti with mussels.

An ophthalmologist is a specialist in ophthalmology. The credentials include a degree in medicine, followed by additional four to five years of ophthalmology residency training. Ophthalmology residency training programs may require a one-year pre-residency training in internal medicine, pediatrics, or general surgery. Additional specialty training (or fellowship) may be sought in a particular aspect of eye pathology. Ophthalmologists are allowed to use medications to treat eye diseases, implement laser therapy, and perform surgery when needed. Ophthalmologists may participate in academic research on the diagnosis and treatment for eye disorders. Diseases A partial list of the most common diseases diagnosed and treated by Ophthalmologists include: *Cataract *Glaucoma *Macular degeneration *Diabetic retinopathy *Dry eyes *Strabismus (misalignment/deviation of eyes) *Proptosis (bulged eyes) *Excessive tearing (tear duct obstruction) *Uveitis *Eye tumors Diagnosis Retinal camera Fundoscopy by using 90 diopter lens with the slit lamp Eye examination Following are examples of methods of diagnosis performed in an eye examination *Visual acuity *Refraction *Ocular tonometry to determine intraocular pressure *Slit lamp examination *Retina examination Specialized tests Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical technological platform used to assess ocular structures. The information is then utilized by physicians/doctors to assess staging of pathological processes and confirm clinical diagnoses. Subsequent OCT scans are used to assess the efficacy managing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Ultrasonography of the eyes may be performed. Ophthalmic surgery An ophthalmologist performing Lasik Eye surgery, also known as ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa by an ophthalmologist. The eye is a fragile organ, and requires extreme care before, during, and after a surgical procedure. An eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions. Subspecialties Ophthalmology includes subspecialities which deal either with certain diseases or diseases of certain parts of the eye. Some of them are: * Anterior segment surgery * Cornea, ocular surface, and external disease * Glaucoma * Medical retina, deals with treatment of retinal problems through non-surgical means. * Vitreo-retinal surgery, deals with surgical management of retinal and posterior segment diseases. Medical retina and vitreo-retinal surgery sometimes together are called posterior segment subspecialisation. * Neuro-ophthalmology * Ocular oncology * Oculoplastics and orbit surgery * Ophthalmic pathology * Paediatric ophthalmology/strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) * Refractive surgery * Uveitis * Veterinary specialty training programs in veterinary ophthalmology exist in some countries. Etymology The Greek roots of the word ophthalmology are ·ΩÄœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºœåœÇ (ophthalmos, \\"eye\\") and -ŒªoŒ≥ŒØŒ± (-logia, \\"study, discourse\\"), i.e., \\"the study of eyes\\". The discipline applies to all animal eyes, whether human or not, since the practice and procedures are quite similar with respect to disease processes, while differences in anatomy or disease prevalence, whether subtle or substantial, may differentiate the two. History Ancient near east and the Greek period In the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt dating to 1550 BC, a section is devoted to eye diseases. The pre-Hippocratics largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than empiricism. They recognized the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by Alcamaeon (5th century BC) and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain by a tube. Aristotle advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He and his contemporaries further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull. The Greek physician Rufus of Ephesus (1st century AD) recognised a more modern eye, with conjunctiva, extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye. Rufus was the first to recognise a two-chambered eye, with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg white-like substance). Celsus the Greek philosopher of the 2nd century AD gave a detailed description of cataract surgery by the couching method. The Greek physician Galen (2nd century AD) remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a posterior chamber. Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after Vesalius. A ciliary body was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid, and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid, as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the tear ducts. Ancient India The Indian surgeon Sushruta wrote Sushruta Samhita in Sanskrit in about 6th century CE which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques.Bidyadhar, N.K. (1939), Sushruta's Ophthalmic Operations, Archives of Ophthalmology, 22, page 553.Agarwal, R.K. (1965), Ancient Indian Ophthalmology, The Ophthalmic Optician, 5(21),1093-1100 (the title of this journal was changed to Optometry Today in 1985), published by the Association of Optometrists, London, England. His description of cataract surgery was compatible with the method of couching.Roy, P.N., Mehra, K.S. and Deshpande, P.J. (1975), Cataract surgery performed before 800 BC, British Journal of Ophthalmology, 59, page 171 He has been described as one of the first cataract surgeons. Medieval Islam Anatomy of the Eye, 1200 CE Medieval Islamic Arabic and Persian scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge. Hunayn ibn Ishaq, and others beginning with the medieval Arabic period, taught that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye. This idea was propagated until the end of the 1500s. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), in his Book of Optics explained that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes. Ibn al-Nafis, an Arabic native of Damascus, wrote a large textbook, The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology, divided into two parts, On the Theory of Ophthalmology and Simple and Compounded Ophthalmic Drugs. Avicenna wrote in his Canon \\"rescheth\\" which means \\"retiformis\\" and Gerard of Cremona translated this around 1150 into the new word \\"retina\\". Modern Period Early Ophthalmology instruments In the 17th and 18th centuries, hand lenses were used by Malpighi, and microscopes by Leeuwenhoek, preparations for fixing the eye for study by Ruysch, and later the freezing of the eye by Petit. This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted, such as: why the pupil changed size (seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the posterior chamber, and the nature of the retina. Unaware of their functions, Leeuwenhoek noted the existence of photoreceptors, however, they were not properly discovered until Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus in 1834. Around 1750, Jacques Daviel advocated a new treatment for cataract by extraction instead of the traditional method of couching. Georg Joseph Beer (1763‚Äì1821) was an Austrian ophthalmologist and leader of the First Viennese School of Medicine. He introduced a flap operation for treatment of cataract (Beer's operation), as well as popularizing the instrument used to perform the surgery (Beer's knife). In North America, indigenous healers treated some eye diseases by rubbing or scraping the eyes or eyelids. Ophthalmic surgery in Great Britain The first ophthalmic surgeon in Great Britain was John Freke, appointed to the position by the Governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1727. A major breakthrough came with the appointment of Baron de Wenzel (1724‚Äì90), a German who became oculist to King George III of England in 1772. His skill at removing cataract legitimized the field. The first dedicated ophthalmic hospital opened in 1805 in London; it is now called Moorfields Eye Hospital. Clinical developments at Moorfields and the founding of the Institute of Ophthalmology (now part of the University College London) by Sir Stewart Duke- Elder established the site as the largest eye hospital in the world and a nexus for ophthalmic research. 19th and 20th centuries New York Ophthalmic Hospital, 1893 The prominent opticians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included Ernst Abbe (1840‚Äì1905), a co-owner of at the Zeiss Jena factories in Germany where he developed numerous optical instruments. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) was a polymath who made contributions to many fields of science and invented the ophthalmoscope in 1851. They both made theoretical calculations on image formation in optical systems and had also studied the optics of the eye. In Berlin, Albrecht von Graefe introduced iridectomy as a treatment for glaucoma and improved cataract surgery, he is also considered the founding father of the German Ophthalmological Society. Central Europe Numerous ophthalmologists fled Germany after 1933 as the Nazis began to persecute those of Jewish descent. A representative leader was Joseph Igersheimer (1879‚Äì1965), best known for his discoveries with arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis. He fled to Turkey in 1933. As one of eight emigrant directors in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Istanbul, he built a modern clinic and trained students. In 1939, he went to the United States, becoming a professor at Tufts University. German ophthalmologist, Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath is widely credited with developing the predecessor of laser coagulation, photocoagulation. In 1946, he conducted the first experiments on light coagulation. In 1949, he performed the first successful treatment of a retinal detachment with a light beam (light coagulation) by with a self-constructed device on the roof of the ophthalmic clinic at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf. Polish ophthalmology dates to the 13th century. The Polish Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1911. A representative leader was Adam Zamenhof (1888‚Äì1940), who introduced certain diagnostic, surgical, and nonsurgical eye-care procedures and was shot by the German Nazis in 1940. Zofia Falkowska (1915‚Äì93) head of the Faculty and Clinic of Ophthalmology in Warsaw from 1963 to 1976, was the first to use lasers in her practice. Professional requirements Ophthalmologists are physicians (MD/DO in the US or MBBS in the UK and elsewhere or D.O./DOMS/ DNB, not OD or BOptom) who have completed a college degree, medical school, and residency in ophthalmology. Ophthalmology training equips eye specialists to provide the full spectrum of eye care, including the prescription of glasses and contact lenses, medical treatment, and complex microsurgery. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer board certification, now a standard practice among all specialties. Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand, the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. The structured training system takes place over five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable. Bangladesh In Bangladesh to be an ophthalmologist the basic degree is an MBBS. Then they have to obtain a postgraduate degree or diploma in specialty ophthalmology. In Bangladesh, these are Diploma in Ophthalmology, Diploma in Community Ophthalmology, Fellow or Member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in ophthalmology, and Master of Science in ophthalmology. Canada In Canada, an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree which culminates in fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC). Subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC) in a variety of fields from anterior segment, cornea, glaucoma, vision rehabilitation, uveitis, oculoplastics, medical and surgical retina, ocular oncology, Ocular pathology, or neuro-ophthalmology. About 35 vacancies open per year for ophthalmology residency training in all of Canada. These numbers fluctuate per year, ranging from 30 to 37 spots. Of these, up to ten spots are at French-speaking universities in Quebec. At the end of the five years, the graduating ophthalmologist must pass the oral and written portions of the Royal College exam in either English or French. Finland In Finland, physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five-year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies. India In India, after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience are in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education. Nepal In Nepal, to become an ophthalmologist, three years postgraduate study is required after completing MBBS degree. The postgraduate degree in ophthalmology is called MD in Ophthalmology. This degree is currently provided by Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Tilganga, Kathmandu, BPKLCO, Institute of Medicine, TU, Kathmandu, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel and National Academy of Medical Science, Kathmandu. Few Nepalese citizen also study this subject in Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and other countries. All the graduates have to pass Nepal Medical Council Licensing Exam to become a registered Ophthalmologist in Nepal. The concurrent residency training is in the form of a PG student (resident) at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution according to the degree providing university's rules and regulations. Nepal Ophthalmic Society holds regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education. Ireland In Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 4.5 years of higher surgical training. Clinical training takes place within public, Health Service Executive-funded hospitals in Dublin, Sligo, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, and Cork. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in consultant posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain MSc, MD or PhD degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States. Pakistan In Pakistan, after MBBS, a four-year full-time residency program leads to an exit-level FCPS examination in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani and eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed. Moreover, a two-and-a-half-year residency program leads to an MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered. For candidates in the military, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi. The M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs. In addition to programs for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists, orthoptists, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmic technologists, and ophthalmic technicians in this field. These programs are being offered notably by the College of Ophthalmology and Allied Vision Sciences in Lahore and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar. Subspecialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of pediatric ophthalmology and vitreoretinal ophthalmology. King Edward Medical University, Al Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi, and Al- Ibrahim Eye Hospital Karachi have also started a degree program in this field. Philippines Ophthalmology is a considered a medical specialty that uses medicine and surgery to treat diseases of the eye. There is only one, duly recognized by the PMA and the PCS, professional organization in the country: the Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology (PAO). PAO and the state-standard Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (PBO) regulates ophthalmology residency programs and board certification. To become a general ophthalmologist in the Philippines, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have completed an internship in Medicine, have passed the physician licensure exam, and completed residency training at a hospital accredited by the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (accrediting arm of PAO). Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from the PBO is essential in acquiring privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in ophthalmology subspecialties, such as neuro-ophthalmology, retina, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, three colleges grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh grant MRCOphth/FRCOphth and MRCSEd/FRCSEd, (although membership is no longer a prerequisite for fellowship), the Royal College of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a specialist registrar and one of these degrees is required for specialization in eye diseases. Such clinical work is within the NHS, with supplementary private work for some consultants. Only 2.3 ophthalmologists exist per 100,000 population in the UK ‚Äì fewer pro rata than in any other nation in the European Union. United States In the United States, ophthalmologists must complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, one year medical or general surgical residency, three years of ophthalmology residency and optional one to two years of speciality training. Ophthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine that specialize in the eye and related structures. They perform medical and surgical eye care and can also write prescriptions for corrective lenses (glasses and contacts). They often deal with advanced forms of eye disease in patients with significant systemic illness. Physicians must complete the requirements of continuing medical education to maintain licensure and for recertification. Professional bodies like the American Academy of Ophthalmology and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery organize conferences, help physician members through continuing medical education programs for maintaining board certification, and provide political advocacy and peer support. Notable ophthalmologists The following is a list of physicians who have significantly contributed to the field of ophthalmology: 18th‚Äì19th centuries Albrecht von Graefe * Theodor Leber discovered Leber's congenital amaurosis, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Leber's miliary aneurysm, and Leber's stellate neuroretinitis. * Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812‚Äì1887), the elder (Austrian), proved that myopia is largely due to an excessive axial length, published influential textbooks on eye disease, and ran annual eye clinics in needy areas long before the concept of volunteer eye camps became popular. His name is still attached to some disease signs, e.g., von Arlt's line in trachoma. His son Ferdinand Ritter von Arlt, the younger, was also an ophthalmologist. * Jacques Daviel (France) claimed to be the founder of modern cataract surgery in that he performed cataract extraction instead of needling the cataract or pushing it back into the vitreous. He is said to have carried out the technique on 206 patients in 1752‚Äì53, of which 182 were reported to be successful. These figures are not very credible, given the total lack of both anaesthesia and aseptic technique at that time. * Franciscus Donders (1818‚Äì1889) (Dutch) published pioneering analyses of ocular biomechanics, intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and physiological optics. He made possible the prescribing of combinations of spherical and cylindrical lenses to treat astigmatism. * Joseph Forlenze (1757‚Äì1833) (Italy), specialist in cataract surgery, became popular during the First French Empire, healing, among many, personalities such as the minister Jean-√âtienne-Marie Portalis and the poet Ponce Denis Lebrun. He was nominated by Napoleon \\"chirurgien oculiste of the lycees, the civil hospices and all the charitable institutions of the departments of the Empire\\".Jan Ellen Goldstein, Console and Classify. The French Psychiatric Profession in the Nineteenth Century, Chicago Press, 2002, p. 63 He was known also for his free interventions, mainly in favour of poor people. Allvar Gullstrand * Albrecht von Graefe (1828‚Äì1870) (Germany) Along with Helmholtz and Donders, one of the 'founding fathers' of ophthalmology as a specialty. He was a brilliant clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence on the development of ophthalmology, and was a pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. He introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. He rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics and miotics. He also was the founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology). He was probably the most important ophthalmologist of the 19th century. * Allvar Gullstrand (Sweden) was a Nobel Prize-winner in 1911 for his research on the eye as a light-refracting apparatus. He described the 'schematic eye', a mathematical model of the human eye based on his measurements known as the 'optical constants' of the eye. His measurements are still used today. * Hermann von Helmholtz, a great German polymath, invented the ophthalmoscope (1851) and published important work on physiological optics, including colour vision (1850s). * Jos√© Rizal (Philippines) was a polymath who inspired the Philippine Revolution with his writings. * Julius Hirschberg (Germany) in 1879 became the first to use an electromagnet to remove metallic foreign bodies from the eye and in 1886 developed the Hirschberg test for measuring strabismus. * Peter Adolph Gad (1846 ‚Äì 1907), Danish ophthalmologist who founded the first eye infirmary in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. * Socrate Polara (1800‚Äì1860, Italy) founded the first dedicated ophthalmology clinic in Sicily in 1829, entirely as a philanthropic endeavor; later he was appointed as the first director of the ophthalmology department at the Grand Hospital of Palermo, Sicily, in 1831 after the Sicilian government became convinced of the importance of state support for the specialization. * Herman Snellen (Netherlands) introduced the Snellen chart to study visual acuity. 20th‚Äì21st centuries * Vladimir Petrovich Filatov (1875‚Äì1956) (Ukraine) contributed the tube flap grafting method, corneal transplantation, and preservation of grafts from cadaver eyes and tissue therapy. He founded the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy, Odessa, one of the leading eye-care institutes in the world. * Shinobu Ishihara (1879-1963) (Japan), in 1918, invented to Ishihara Color Vision Test, a common method for determining Color blindness. He also made major contributions to the study of Trachoma and Myopia. * Ignacio Barraquer (1884‚Äì1965) (Spain), in 1917, invented the first motorized vacuum instrument (erisophake) for intracapsular cataract extraction. He founded the Barraquer Clinic in 1941 and the Barraquer Institute in 1947 in Barcelona, Spain. *Ernst Fuchs (1851-1930) was an Austrian ophthalmologist known for his discovery and description of numerous ocular diseases and abnormalities including Fuchs' dystrophy and Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis. * Tsutomu Sato (Japan) Pioneer in incisional refractive surgery, including techniques for astigmatism and the invention of radial keratotomy for myopia. * Jules Gonin (1870‚Äì1935) (Switzerland) was the \\"father of retinal detachment surgery\\". * Sir Harold Ridley (United Kingdom), in 1949, may have been the first to successfully implant an artificial intraocular lens after observing that plastic fragments in the eyes of wartime pilots were well tolerated. He fought for decades against strong reactionary opinions to have the concept accepted as feasible and useful. * Charles Schepens (Belgium) was the \\"father of modern retinal surgery\\" and developer of the Schepens indirect binocular ophthalmoscope whilst at Moorfields Eye Hospital. He was the founder of the Schepens Eye Research Institute, associated with Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in Boston, Massachusetts. *Marshall M. Parks was the \\"father of pediatric ophthalmology\\". * Jos√© Ignacio Barraquer (1916‚Äì1998) (Spain) was the \\"father of modern refractive surgery\\". In the 1960s, he developed lamellar techniques, including keratomileusis and keratophakia, as well as the first microkeratome and corneal microlathe. * Frank M Polack (1929 ‚Äì 2007) was an American ophthalmologist who designed the Polack forceps for corneal transplants. * Frederick T. Fraunfelder (b. 1934), ocular oncologist * Tadeusz Krwawicz (Poland), in 1961, developed the first cryoprobe for intracapsular cataract extraction. * Svyatoslav Fyodorov (Russia) was the \\"father of ophthalmic microsurgery\\". He improved and popularized radial keratotomy, invented a surgical cure for cataract, and developed scleroplasty. * Charles Kelman (United States) developed the ultrasound and mechanized irrigation and aspiration system for phacoemulsification, first allowing cataract extraction through a small incision. * Ioannis Pallikaris (Greece) performed the first laser-assisted intrastromal keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery.

In the Bible, Nimrod is considered the creator of the Tower of Babel, and King Solomon built Solomon's Temple with the assistance of the architect Hiram. In Hinduism, the palaces of the gods were built by the architect and artisan Vivasvat. Moreover, Indian epic Mahabharata cites amazing work by architect 'Maya.' Architects also occur in modern fiction. Examples include Howard Roark, protagonist in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead; Bloody Stupid Johnson, a parody of Capability Brown who appears in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels; and Slartibartfast, designer of planets in Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Basil Al Bayati's novel The Age of Metaphors on the theme of Metaphoric Architecture is also replete with fictional architects. The main characters of Sa'ad, Shiymaa and Sa'im are all architects, as are a number of others who appear throughout the book. Many films have included central characters who are architects, including Henry Fonda's character \\"Juror 8\\" (Davis) in 12 Angry Men (1957), Charles Bronson's character in Death Wish (1974), John Cassavetes' character in Tempest (1982), Wesley Snipes' character in \\"Jungle Fever\\" (1991), Christopher Lloyd's character in Suburban Commando (1991), Tom Hanks' character in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), David Strathairn's character in The River Wild (1994), Michael J. Fox's character in The Frighteners (1996), Michael Keaton's character in White Noise (2005) and Jeremy Irons' character in High-Rise (2015). In television, Mike Brady, father of The Brady Bunch, is an architect; as is Wilbur Post, owner of Mister Ed; Ted Mosby, from How I Met Your Mother; and David Vincent from The Invaders. Adam Cartwright of Bonanza was an architectural engineer with a university education who designed the sprawling familial ranch-house on the Ponderosa Ranch. The character George Costanza pretends to be an architect named \\"Art Vandelay\\" in Seinfeld. Architect Halvard Solness is the protagonist of Henrick Ibsen's 1892 play The Master Builder.

The term is mostly found in science fiction. Reference to a \\"star-ship\\" appears as early as 1882 in Oahspe: A New Bible.; While NASA's Voyager and Pioneer probes have traveled into local interstellar space, the purpose of these uncrewed craft was specifically interplanetary, and they are not predicted to reach another star system (although Voyager 1 will travel to within 1.7 light years of Gliese 445 in approximately 40,000 years). Several preliminary designs for starships have been undertaken through exploratory engineering, using feasibility studies with modern technology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future. In April 2016, scientists announced Breakthrough Starshot, a Breakthrough Initiatives program, to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of small centimeter-sized light sail spacecraft named StarChip, capable of making the journey to Alpha Centauri, the nearest extrasolar star system, at speeds of 20% and 15% of the speed of light, taking between 20 and 30 years to reach the star system, respectively, and about 4 years to notify Earth of a successful arrival. In November 2018, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced that SpaceX was renaming the second stage and spaceship of the Big Falcon Rocket, a fully reusable launch vehicle and spacecraft system, to Starship. Though the spacecraft does not possess any reasonable interstellar capability, Musk defended the name by claiming that \\"later versions will.\\" Research Artist's conception of British Interplanetary Society's Project Daedalus (1978), a fusion powered interstellar probe To travel between stars in a reasonable time using rocket-like technology requires very high effective exhaust velocity jet and enormous energy to power this, such as might be provided by fusion power or antimatter. There are very few scientific studies that investigate the issues in building a starship. Some examples of this include: *Project Orion (1958‚Äì1965), mostly manned interplanetary spacecraft *Project Daedalus (1973‚Äì1978), unmanned interstellar probe *Project Longshot (1987‚Äì1988), unmanned interstellar probe *Project Icarus (2009‚Äì2014), unmanned interstellar probe *Hundred-Year Starship (2011), manned interstellar craft The Bussard ramjet is an idea to use nuclear fusion of interstellar gas to provide propulsion. Examined in an October 1973 issue of Analog, the Enzmann Starship proposed using a 12,000-ton ball of frozen deuterium to power pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the Empire State Building and assembled in- orbit, the proposed spacecraft would be part of a larger project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems. The NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program (1996‚Äì2002) was a professional scientific study examining advanced spacecraft propulsion systems. Theoretical types A common literary device is to posit a faster-than-light propulsion system (such as warp drive) or travel through hyperspace, although some starships may be outfitted for centuries-long journeys of slower-than- light travel. Other designs posit a way to boost the ship to near-lightspeed, allowing relatively \\"quick\\" travel (i.e. decades, not centuries) to nearer stars. This results in a general categorization of the kinds of starships: * Sleeper, which put their passengers into stasis during a long trip. This includes cryonics-based systems that freeze passengers for the duration of the journey. * Generation, in which the destination would be reached by descendants of the original passengers. * Relativistic, taking advantage of time dilation at close-to-light-speeds, so long trips will seem much shorter (but still take the same amount of time for outside observers). * Faster-than- light, which can move between places very quickly (using inter-dimensional shortcuts or wormholes). There is a theoretical means of achieving FTL (Faster-than-light) travel within our current understanding of physics however; it is also known as a \\"warp drive\\" and was introduced by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. The paper, entitled \\"The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity\\", showed that space itself could be topographically warped to create a local region of spacetime wherein the region ahead of the \\"warp bubble\\" is compressed, allowed to resume normalcy within the bubble, and then rapidly expanded behind the bubble creating an effect that results in apparent FTL travel. His paper showed that all this could be achieved within the pre-established confines of General Relativity, without the introduction of wormholes. Alcubierre, Miguel https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009013. Further work by Harold \\"Sonny\\" White of NASA's JSC has developed the initial mathematical models further and debuted those developments in 2011 in a paper titled \\"Warp Field Mechanics 101\\".White, Harold. \\"Warp Field Mechanics 101\\", NASA, Houston, TX. He is currently testing his improved models. Fictional elements Certain common elements are found in most fiction that discusses starships. Slower-than-light Fiction that discusses slower-than-light starships is relatively rare, since the time scales are so long. Instead of describing the interaction with the outside world, those fictions tend to focus on setting the whole story within the world of the (often very large) starship during its long travels. Sometimes the starship is a world, in perception or reality. Faster-than-light Travel at velocities greater than the speed of light is impossible according to the known laws of physics, although apparent faster-than-light (FTL) is not excluded by general relativity. The Alcubierre drive provides a theoretical way of achieving FTL, although it requires negative mass, which has not been discovered. Nevertheless, Harold G. White at NASA has designed the White‚ÄìJuday warp-field interferometer to detect a microscopic instance of a warping of space-time according to the Alcubierre drive. Fictional examples There are widely known vessels in various science fiction franchises. The most prominent cultural use and one of the earliest common uses of the term starship was in Star Trek: The Original Series.

The Star Wars science fiction universe, created by George Lucas, features dialogue that is not spoken in natural languages. The lingua franca of the franchise, for which the language the words are dubbed or written stand in, is Galactic Basic. Characters often speak languages other than Basic, notably Shyriiwook spoken by Chewbacca, droidspeak spoken by R2-D2 and BB-8, and Huttese spoken by Jabba the Hutt. The fictional languages were approached as sound design and developed largely by Ben Burtt, sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogy of films. He created alien dialogue out of the sounds of primarily non-English languages, such as Quechua, Haya, and Tibetan. This methodology was also used in The Force Awakens by Sara Forsberg. Lucas also insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the English alphabet as possible, and constructed alphabets were developed. The languages constructed for the films were criticized as not being true constructed languages, instead relying on creating the simple impression of a fully developed language. The usage of heavily accented English for alien characters was also criticized as contributing to the suggestion of racial stereotypes.  Development  Language development was approached as sound design and was handled by Ben Burtt, sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogies. He created the alien dialogue out of existing non-English language phrases and their sounds, such as Quechua for Greedo in the original Star Wars film and Haya for the character Nien Nunb in Return of the Jedi. He also used English, as in the original Star Wars where he synthesized originally English dialogue from a Western film until it sounded alien. Burtt said of the process: \\"It usually meant doing some research and finding an existing language or several languages which were exotic and interesting, something that our audience ‚Äî 99 percent of them ‚Äî would never understand.\\" This methodology to create the sound of alien languages was carried into production of The Force Awakens. Director J. J. Abrams asked Sara Forsberg, who lacked a professional background in linguistics but created the viral video series \\"What Languages Sound Like to Foreigners\\" on YouTube, to develop alien dialogue spoken by Indonesian actor Yayan Ruhian. Forsberg was asked to listen to \\"Euro-Asian languages\\", and she drew from Gujarati, Hindi, and other Asian languages as well as Indonesian and Sundanese, Ruhian's native language. She also listened to languages she did not understand to better structure the words and sentences to sound believable. During production of the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the English alphabet as possible and strongly opposed English-looking characters in screens and signage. In developing typefaces for use in Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, including Mandalorian and Geonosian scripts, graphic artist Philip Metschan created alphabets that did not have twenty-six letters like the English alphabet.  Galactic Basic  Galactic Basic, often simply Basic, is the lingua franca of the Star Wars universe, for which the language in which the works are dubbed or written acts as a stand-in.  Accents  Lucas intended to balance American accents and British accents between the heroes and villains of the original film so that each side had each. He also strove to keep accents \\"very neutral\\", noting Alec Guinness's and Peter Cushing's mid- Atlantic accents and his guidance to Anthony Daniels to speak in an American accent. In critical commentary on Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, Patricia Williams of The Nation felt there was a correlation between accent and social class, noting that Jedi speak with \\"crisp British accents\\" while the \\"graceful conquered women of the Naboo\\" and \\"white slaves\\" such as Anakin and Shmi Skywalker \\"speak with the brusque, determined innocence of middle-class Americans\\". To decide on the sound of Nute Gunray, a Neimoidian character portrayed by Silas Carson, Lucas and Rick McCallum listened to actors from different countries reading Carson's lines. Eventually, they chose a heavily Thai-accented English, and Carson rerecorded the dialogue to mimic the Thai actor's accent. Gunray's accent was described by critics to be \\"Hollywood Oriental\\" that contributed to criticism of Gunray as an Asian stereotype. Watto's accent was similarly criticized as lending to anti-Semitic and anti- Arab connotations.  Non-standard Basic  Yoda characteristically speaks a non-standard syntax of Basic, primarily constructing sentences in object- subject-verb word order rare in natural languages. This sentence construction is cited as a \\"clever device for making him seem very alien\\" and characterizes his dialogue as \\"vaguely riddle-like, which adds to his mystique\\". This tendency is noted to be written for an English-speaking audience; the word order is retained in Estonian subtitles, where it is grammatical but unusual and emphatic, and Yoda's dialogue is in subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb word order in Czech dubs. Gungan characters, notably Jar Jar Binks, speak in a heavily accented Basic dialect critics described as a \\"Caribbean-flavored pidgin\\", \\"a pidgin mush of West African, Caribbean and African-American linguistic styles\\", \\"very like Jamaican patois, albeit a notably reductive, even infantilized sort\\", and suggestive of stereotypical African-American culture. This was cited as a trait that led to criticism of the Gungan species as a racially offensive stereotype or caricature.  Aurebesh  Star Tours, in Tokyo Disneyland Aurebesh is a writing system used to represent spoken Galactic Basic and is the most commonly seen form of written language in the Star Wars franchise. The alphabet was based on shapes designed by Joe Johnston for the original trilogy, which are briefly featured in screen displays in Return of the Jedi. Johnston's design, called Star Wars 76, was created into a font and again used in Attack of the Clones by Metschan, who incorporated the font alongside the later Aurebesh version used in the spin-off products. In the early 1990s, Stephen Crane, art director at West End Games, became intrigued with the shapes as they appeared on the Death Star. He sought to develop them into an alphabet to be used in West End Games' licensed Star Wars products, primarily to allow players to render their characters' names, and received permission from Lucasfilm to do so as long as it was presented as one of many alphabets in the Star Wars galaxy, not the sole and exclusive alphabet. After copying the letters from screenshots by hand, he standardized the letters based on shapes similar to the Eurostile font. He named and assigned a value to each letter, and derived the name \\"Aurebesh\\" from the names of the first two letters: aurek and besh. Once Crane completed the alphabet, Lucasfilm requested a copy to distribute to other licensees. In anticipation of the December 2015 release of The Force Awakens, Google Translate added a feature to render text into Aurebesh in November 2015 and was subsequently removed in February 2016. Other languages  Dathomiri  With only some samples of archaic speech found in Season 3 of The Clone Wars, Dathomiri is spoken primarily by the Bakura species. Mother Talzin, a Witch of Dathomir, associated with the Nightsisters is found speaking this while exorcising Darth Maul on Dathomir. This unidentified language first appeared in April 1994 in Dave Wolverton's The Courtship of Princess Leia, when the young Teneniel Djo unleashes a Spell of Storm on Luke Skywalker and Prince Isolder of Hapes. Through retroactive continuity, though, the first real appearance of this language might be in the 1985 made-for-TV film Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. In this story, the witch Charal‚Äîwho was later retconned into a Nightsister‚Äîwas seen incanting over a crystal oscillator.  Droidspeak  Droidspeak is a language consisting of beeps and other synthesized sounds used by some droid characters, such as R2-D2 and BB-8. Burtt created R2-D2's dialogue in the original Star Wars with an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer and by processing his own vocalizations via other effects. In The Force Awakens, BB-8's dialogue was created by manipulating the voices of Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz with a talkbox running through a sound effects application on an iPad. Although droidspeak is generally unintelligible to the viewing audience, it appears to be understood by characters such as Luke Skywalker. Ewokese The Ewoks of the forest moon of Endor speak a \\"primitive dialect\\" of one of the more than six million other forms of communication that C-3PO is familiar with. Ben Burtt, Return of the Jedi‚Äôs sound designer, created the Ewok language. On the commentary track for the DVD of Return of the Jedi, Burtt identified the language that he heard in the BBC documentary as Kalmyk Oirat, a tongue spoken by the isolated nomadic Kalmyks. He describes how, after some research, he identified an 80-year-old Kalmyk refugee. He recorded her telling folk stories in her native language, and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman's voice in different styles. For the scene in which C-3PO speaks Ewokese, actor Anthony Daniels worked with Burtt and invented words, based on the Kalmyk recordings.Ben Burtt, DVD commentary on The Return of the Jedi. Marcia Calkovsky of Lethbridge University maintains that Tibetan language contributed to Ewok speech along with Kalmyk, starting the story from attempts to use language samples of Native Americans and later turning to nine Tibetan women living in San Francisco area, as well as one Kalmyk woman. The story of the choice of these languages is referenced to Burtt's 1989 telephone interview, and many of the used Tibetan phrases translated. The initial prayer Ewoks address to C-3PO is actually the beginning part of Tibetan Buddhist prayer for the benefit of all sentient beings, or so called brahmavihƒÅras or apramƒÅ·πáas, but also there is a second (out of four) part of the refuge prayer. People of the Tibetan diaspora were puzzled as many of the phrases they could make out did not correlate to events on screen.  Rodian  In the original Star Wars film, Greedo speaks an unspecified alien language, later identified as Rodian, which is understood by Han Solo, before the latter kills the bounty hunter. Bruce Mannheim described Greedo as speaking \\"morphologically well-formed\\" phrases of Southern Quechua, though the sentence is ultimately meaningless. Allen Sonnefrank, a Quechua speaker and linguistic anthropology student at University of California, Berkeley, claimed Lucasfilm contacted him to record Quecha dialogue for the film. Because he was told the dialogue was to be played backward for the film, Sonnefrank refused to record the dialogue, feeling it to be a \\"potentially exploitative move best made by one whose first language was Quechua, if at all\\". Huttese \\"Jabba's alphabet\\" from a Star Wars-themed Pizza Hut box. Another lingua franca in the Star Wars Universe that is spoken by many groups and species is Huttese, spoken on Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and other worlds in and around the Hutt Space (this is the name of the zone, in the galactic West, which is illegally controlled by the Hutts and, in the Star Wars Legends continuity, covers the dominions of the former Hutt Empire). It is spoken in the films by both non-humans (Jabba the Hutt, Watto, Sebulba and others) and humans. In fact, the whole Max Rebo Band communicates and sings in Huttese. Its phonology is said to be based on the Quechuan languages. Many Huttese alphabets are featured through the franchise (most notably Boonta alphabet and Nal Huttese), but the one considered \\"canonical\\" by fans is the one found on promotional Pizza Hut pizza boxeshttp://www.completewermosguide.com/huttese.html. Jawaese and Jawa trade language The Jawas, also found on Tatooine, speak in a high-pitched, squeaky voice. To speak to others of their species along with the voice they emit a smell showing their emotions. https://www.starwars.com/news/much-to- learn-you-still-have-7-things-you-might-not-know-about-jawas . When trading droids and dealing with non-Jawas they speak without the smell because many consider the smell \\"foul\\". A famous exclamation in Jawaese is \\"Utinni!\\", as screamed by a Jawa to the others in A New Hope, shortly after blasting R2-D2.  Mando'a  Attack of the Clones.alt=The letters and numerals of the Mandalorian alphabet A written form of the Mandalorian language was developed by Metschan for the display screens of Jango Fett's ship Slave I in Attack of the Clones, and it was later reused in The Clone Wars and Rebels. Composer Jesse Harlin, needing lyrics for the choral work he wanted for the 2005 Republic Commando video game, invented a spoken form, intending it to be an ancient language. It was named \\"Mando'a\\" and extensively expanded by Karen Traviss, author of the Republic Commando novel series. Mando'a is characterized as a primarily spoken, agglutinative language that lacks grammatical gender in its nouns and pronouns. The language is also characterized as lacking a passive voice, instead primarily speaking in active voice. It is also described as having three grammatical tenses‚Äîpresent, past, and future‚Äîbut it is said to be often vague and its speakers typically do not use tenses other than the present. The language is described as having a mutually intelligible dialect called \\"Concordian\\" spoken on the planet Concord Dawn, as stated in Traviss's novels Order 66 and 501st, and a dialect spoken on Mandalore's moon Concordia is heard in \\"The Mandalore Plot\\", a season two episode of The Clone Wars.  Sith  The Sith language, intended to be spoken by Sith characters, was created by Ben Grossblatt for the Book of Sith, published in February 2012. Development on the language and accompanying writing system began in November 2010. Grossblatt sought to create a pronounceable language that was not \\"cartoonish\\" and \\"would conform to the patterns of principles of language. He felt that it needed to \\"feel martial and mystical\\" and be a \\"suitable, aesthetically-pleasing vehicle for communication\\". He characterized the sound of the language as \\"tough‚Äîbut not barbarous\\" and as \\"convey[ing] a kind of confident, elegant cruelty\\". To achieve \\"formal, quasi-military\\" and \\"imposing, undeniable\\" qualities, he preferred closed syllables, creating brisk and choppy words, and constructed the language as agglutinative.  Shyriiwook  Shyriiwook, also known as Wookieespeak, is a language consisting largely of roars and growls spoken by Wookiee characters, notably Chewbacca. Non-Wookiee characters are capable of understanding Shyriiwook, such as Chewbacca's friend Han Solo. Chewbacca's dialogue was created from recordings of walruses, camels, bears, and badgers from Burtt's personal sound library. One of the most prominent elements was an American black bear living in the Happy Hollow Park & Zoo in San Jose, California. These sounds were mixed in different ratios to create different roars. Tusken Raiders The Tusken Raiders of Tatooine it is difficult for non-Tuskens to understand this language, although the The Mandalorian in the Disney+ series The Mandalorian was able to understand it and respond in sign language of what is presumably the same language according to the video game Knights of the Old Republic, speak a language of their own. In the game, a droid named HK-47 assists the player in communicating with the Tusken Raiders. In the novelizations Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they captured her in a raid. Generally, they utter roars and battle cries when seen in public.  Ubese  Ubese is a language heard in Return of the Jedi during a scene where a disguised Princess Leia bargains with Jabba the Hutt through translator C-3PO. Leia repeats the same Ubese phrase three times, translated differently in subtitles and by C-3PO each time. David J. Peterson, linguist and creator of constructed languages, cited his attempt as a young fan to reconcile this apparent impossibility as an example of how even casual fans may notice errors in fictional constructed languages. He characterized Ubese as a \\"sketch\\" of a language rather than a fully developed language and categorized it as a \\"fake language\\" intended to \\"give the impression of a real language in some context without actually being a real language\\". Ultimately, he criticized Ubese as \\"poorly constructed and not worthy of serious consideration\\".  Critical commentary  Ben Zimmer labeled the method of language construction in Star Wars \\"a far cry\\" from that of constructed languages like Klingon, Na'vi, and Dothraki, and he described the use of language as \\"never amount[ing] to more than a sonic pastiche\\". Linguistic anthropologist Jim Wilce summarized analyses of language in Star Wars conducted through the Society for Linguistic Anthropology's electronic mailing list. David Samuels described the approach to language as instrumental and compared the films to a Summer Institute of Linguistics convention, in which \\"there are no untranslatable phrases, and everyone can understand everyone else\\", and pointed out that the \\"idea that the Force is something that would be understood differently in the context of different grammars is never broached\\". Hal Schiffmann made five observations about language in Star Wars: all humans speak English and no other real-world language, there is \\"mutual passive bilingualism\\" in which characters speaking different languages understand one another, non-human creatures may have their own languages but are translated by C-3PO, certain non-English vocalizations serve to confuse or amuse the audience rather than serve as language, even non-English speaking characters are expected to understand English. Zimmer supported Schiffmann's claim that untranslated alien languages are not representations of real languages by pointing to the film's script, which describes the language of the Jawas as \\"a queer, unintelligible language\\" and that of the Tusken Raiders as \\"a coarse, barbaric language\\". Wilce also pointed out discussion on the usage of real non-English to create the \\"Otherness\\" of characters such as Jabba the Hutt, Greedo, and the Ewoks.

Its editorial collective sometimes has divergent views on the topics the magazine addresses but generally shares anarchist, anti- authoritarian outlook and a non-dogmatic, action-oriented approach to change. The title implies that the periodical is an alternative to the fourth estate (traditional print journalism). Fifth Estate is frequently cited as the longest running English language anarchist publication in North America, although this is sometimes disputed since it became only explicitly anti- authoritarian in 1975 after ten years of publishing as part of the 1960s Underground Press movement. The archives for the Fifth Estate are held at the Labadie Collection in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  History   Origin  Fifth Estate was started by Harvey Ovshinsky, a seventeen-year-old youth from Detroit. He was inspired by a 1965 summer trip to California where he worked on the Los Angeles Free Press, the first underground paper in the United States; Harvey's father, inventor Stan Ovshinsky, knew the editor of the Free Press, Art Kunkin, from their years as comrades in the Socialist Party.Proceedings. 1960 National Convention, Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation. The name \\"Fifth Estate\\" was inspired by The Fifth Estate coffee house on the Sunset Strip, where the Free Press had its office in the basement. The first issue was published on November 19, 1965‚Äî\\"That's what we really are‚Äîthe voice of the liberal element in Detroit\\", it said. It was produced on a typewriter and then reproduced by offset lithograph, in an 8-page tabloid newspaper format with two pages left blank. It featured a critical review of a Bob Dylan concert, a borrowed Jules Feiffer cartoon, alternative events listing and an announcement of a forthcoming anti-Vietnam War march. None of these things would have been included in contemporary newspapers. In 1966 Ovshinsky moved the office from his parents' basement to a Cass Corridor storefront near Wayne State University. Here the paper was saved from extinction by the Detroit Committee to End the War in Vietnam, John Sinclair's Artist Workshop, and other radicals, with Sinclair signing on as the paper's first music editor. Later in 1966 the paper moved to Plum Street where they also established a bookshop. Fifth Estate thrived in the late sixties, a period when over 500 underground papers emerged in the US. Thousands of copies were distributed locally with hundreds more being sent to GIs in Vietnam. Fifth Estate openly called on soldiers to mutiny. In 1967 the Fifth Estate offices were tear-gassed by the National Guard during the 12th Street riot. In this period the print run reached 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 copies, publishing biweekly in a tabloid newspaper format of 20 to 32 pages, with local ads and listings. The spirit of the paper during the first ten years of its existence was summed up in a Feb. 1, 1969, staff editorial: 1970s By 1972 the optimism of the sixties had worn off and the tone of the paper became more concerned with struggle than fun. Ovshinsky had left in 1969,The Underground Press in America by Robert J. Glessing (Indiana Univ. Press, 1970), p. 23. leaving a group of young people (teenagers or in their early twenties) to run the paper. Peter Werbe, a 29-year-old Michigan State dropout who had been with the paper since March 1966, took over as editor.\\"The underground press in America: A special report\\" by John Burks. Rolling Stone, Oct. 4, 1969, p. 11-33. The staff sent delegations to Vietnam, Cambodia and Cuba. The massive defeat of George McGovern and the election of Richard Nixon for a second term with an increased vote damaged the movement‚Äîmany underground papers stopped coming out and the alternative news services such as the Liberation News Service, and the Underground Press Syndicate collapsed. The Fifth Estate was mentioned in the national press when one of its reporters, Pat Halley, threw a shaving cream pie at Guru Maharaj Ji in 1973. Though the guru forgave him publicly, two of his followers attacked Halley a week later and fractured his skull. By 1975, Fifth Estate was lingering on‚Äîmany staff had burnt out through too much activism and they had their share of internal disputes. The debts were mounting. In August 1975, Vol. 11, No.1 declared \\"The issue you are now holding is the last issue of the Fifth Estate - the last issue of a failing capitalist enterprise‚Ä¶This is also the first issue of a new Fifth Estate.\\" This was the first explicitly anti-authoritarian issue of Fifth Estate. The paper had been taken over by the Eat the Rich Gang, a group that had successfully published several pamphlets and were particularly influenced by Fredy Perlman, Jacques Camatte, Jean Baudrillard, Council communism, and Left Communism, as well as the Situationists. They did not originally identify themselves as explicitly anarchist and had no contacts with the anarchist currents of the 1930s. However, they were contacted by veterans of that period who they saw as powerful role models. Those included Marcus Graham (publisher of the 1930s anarchist periodical Man!) and Spanish and Italian anarchist veterans. They also developed a close relationship with Black and Red Press, a radical printers/publishers group with which Lorraine and Fredy Perlman were involved. 1980s and 1990s By 1980, the paper had become more anti- technological and anti-civilisation, something for which it was well known throughout the 1980s. It was the focal point for the development of the political trend of anarcho-primitivism. Long-time contributor John Zerzan published his seminal essays on time, language, art, number and agriculture in the magazine. His articles were frequently accompanied by long critiques by George Bradford (n√©e David Watson) or Bob Brubaker, who developed different versions of primitivism. After Zerzan's 1988 article on agriculture, he started publishing his new essays in Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. Dismayed by what he saw as the excesses of Zerzan and others, Watson eventually repudiated primitivism in his 1997 essay \\"Swamp Fever\\".\\"Swamp Fever: Primitivism & the Ideological Vortex\\", Fifth Estate #350 (vol 32, #2), Fall 1997. pp 15‚Äì25 However, as of 2012, Zerzan began publishing articles in the Fifth Estate again on subjects as varied as the Black Bloc, the sea, and the Luddites. 2001 to present In 2002, the center of the magazine shifted from Detroit, Michigan to Liberty, Tennessee when long-time contributor Andrew Smith (who wrote under the name Andy Sunfrog) took over the main editorial duties of the magazine, although long-time Detroit staffers like Peter Werbe remained involved. In 2006, Fifth Estate decentralized their editorial group, and since then issues have been published that were primarily produced in Michigan, Tennessee, New York and Wisconsin. The current editorial collective has moved away from primitivism, does not endorse a specific political line and welcomes voices from disparate strains of anti- authoritarian thought. The group also continues to endorse anarchism as a specific ideology, but embraces a more inclusive, yet still radical, anti- capitalist perspective. Continuing to cover environmental and anti-capitalist resistance, articles have also appeared which address immigration, race, feminism, queer sexuality and transgender issues. Smith left the paper in 2009 to pursue an academic career at a Tennessee university, but still contributes an occasional article. The magazine shifted back to Detroit for final editing and production with Peter and Marilyn Werbe having responsibility for much of that plus the magazine's business functions. The collective now consists of the Werbes and several others throughout North America In 2008, long-time contributor Marius Mason was arrested as part of what some call the Green Scare. In February 2009, he was sentenced to almost 22 years for two acts of environmentally motivated property destruction. The Fifth Estate has run articles protesting both the labeling of his actions as \\"terrorism\\" as well as the long sentence he received.

It was based in the west of England and was originally known as George Parnall & Co. Ltd. History Memorial to the 52 killed in German air raids on 27 February 1941 at Parnall Aircraft in Yate In 1916, the Bristol based Parnall & Sons shopfitters started to manufacture aircraft at the Colliseum Works at Park Row in Bristol. During the First World War, the skilled staff were moved to sites around the city and in neighbouring South Gloucestershire producing planes to their own designs and, under contract, those of other companies. In 1919, the aircraft business was split from the parent company Parnall & Sons as George Parnall and Company. In the 1920s, aircraft manufacture was centralised at a factory in Yate close to an airfield used by the Royal Flying Corps. In the 1930s, gun turrets for bomber aircraft were produced. The site was a strategic target for Luftwaffe bombing and during 1941, over fifty people were killed during the raids. In 1935, Parnall Aircraft Limited was formed when George Parnall and Company amalgamated with the Hendy Aircraft Company and Nash and Thompson Limited.Jackson 1974, p. 89 After the Second World War as aircraft component manufacture reduced, domestic appliances were built at the site. To reflect this move away from aviation the company changed its name to Parnall (Yate) Limited in 1946. Aircraft Parnall Scout fighter prototype nearing completion The Parnall Scout was a prototype single-seat anti-airship wooden biplane fighter aircraft developed in the 1910s. It was too heavy and slow and never went into production. The Parnall Panther was a carrier-based wooden, single-bay biplane spotter and reconnaissance aircraft designed by Harold Bolas, who had joined Parnall and Sons after leaving the Admiralty's Air Department. It had a 230 hp Bentley BR2 rotary engine. Following contractual disputes production was transferred to the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The Parnall Puffin was an experimental amphibious fighter-reconnaissance biplane. The Parnall Plover single-seat naval fighter aircraft of the 1920s for use off the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers, was ordered into small-scale production, but after extensive evaluation, the Fairey Flycatcher was preferred for large- scale service. The Parnall Possum was an experimental triplane, with a single, central engine driving wing-mounted propellers via shafts and gears. Two of these aircraft were built in the mid-1920s. The Parnall Pixie was a low- powered single-seat monoplane light aircraft originally designed to compete in the Lympne, UK trials for motor-gliders in 1923, where it was flown successfully by Norman Macmillan. It had two sets of wings, one for cross- country flights and the other for speed; it later appeared as a biplane which could be converted into a monoplane.\\"Pixie.\\" Flight, 25 October 1923, pp. 653-654. Parnall Pixie IIIa G-EBJG is still in existence with the Midland Air Museum, Coventry, England. The remains are in deep store and are not generally on view to the public without prior arrangement. The Parnall Perch was a single-engined, side-by-side-seat aircraft designed as a general-purpose trainer. No contract on this specification was awarded and only one Perch was built. The Peto N181 The Parnall Peto was a small seaplane with folding wings for use as a submarine-carried reconnaissance aircraft.Flight 1929 The Parnall Pike was a two/three-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft, capable of operating off carrier decks or from water, built in 1927.\\"Parnall Pike\\" All- Aero. Retrieved 5 March 2015. Only one was constructed. The Parnall Pipit was a single-engine, single-seat naval fighter designed to an Air Ministry specification in 1927. Two prototypes were built but both were destroyed by tail flutter. The Parnall Imp was an unusual single-engine, two-seat biplane built in 1927. It had a straight cantilever lower wing which supported the markedly swept upper wing. Only one was built.Jackson 1974, p. 280 The Parnall Elf was a two-seat light touring biplane, three being built at Yate between 1928 and 1932. The Elf was the last aircraft designed by Harold Bolas before he left the company to go to the United States. The Parnall Prawn was an experimental flying boat built in 1930. Its single engine was fitted on a tilting mounting in the nose, so that the propeller could be kept clear of the water on takeoff and landing. Only one was built and it is not known whether it was ever flown. The Parnall Parasol was an experimental parasol winged aircraft design to measure the aerodynamic forces on wings in flight. Two were built and flown in the early 1930s. The Parnall G.4/31 was a 1930s general purpose aircraft which could operate as a day and night bomber as well as the reconnaissance, torpedo and dive-bombing roles. It was a large angular biplane powered by a 690 hp (515 kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 with a Townend ring. The Parnall Heck was designed by Basil B. Henderson as a single-engined, conventional low-wing cabin monoplane, built of spruce with a plywood covering, initially a two-seater in tandem layout. The prototype was originally flown as the Hendy Heck but by the time of its first public demonstration in July 1935, the companies had merged and the aircraft was renamed as the Parnall Heck. The Parnall 382 (also known as the Heck III), was a single-engined wooden monoplane trainer aircraft with two open cockpits. It first flew in 1939.
