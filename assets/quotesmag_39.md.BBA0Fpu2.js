It was isolated from a geothermally heated freshwater pool in the Valley of Geysers on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia in 1990. The species was originally named Anaerocellum thermophilum, but reclassified in 2010, based on genomic data.  Biofuel production  C. bescii is commonly used to generate microbiofuel. Although growth at temperatures up to 85 degrees Celsius have been noted, the optimum growth temperature is 75 degrees Celsius. C. bescii was originally grouped in the Anaerocellum thermophilum because of growth physiology, cell wall type and morphology. 16S rRNA sequencing later showed distinguishable differences that are responsible for placement in the Caldicellulosiruptor clade. C. besci is a Gram-positive, rod- shaped bacterium notable for its ability use a variety of polymeric carbohydrates and di- and monosaccharides to produce H2, acetate, lactate, and trace amounts of ethanol. C. bescii has been selected for study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Georgia's Department of Genetics for its ability to degrade cellulose. Through plasmid recombination the region for the gene encoding production of lactate dehydrogenase has been deleted causing the microbe to produce elevated levels of acetate and H2. Bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase genes from Clostridium thermocellum allow for the conversion of sugars to ethanol. This genetically modified strain is able to convert biomass composed of switch-grass to ethanol. Diversity C. bescii has the highest growth temperature out of nine different isolates in the genus of Caldicellulosiruptor. It can grow at temperatures up to 90¬∞ Celsius with an optimum growth temperature of 75¬∞ Celsius. In 1990, C. bescii was described formally and the type strain was deposited as DSM 6725. Shortly after, C. bescii was classified as a member of a new genus Anaerocellum and named Anaerocellum thermophilum, strain Z-1320. Studies were conducted to compare and contrast the strains. A study on the DSM 6725 strain with hemicellulose, cellulose and pectin showed notable differences compared to what was reported with strain Z-1320. The tests showed that DSM 6725 was able to grow on pectin and xylose, while it was previously shown that strain Z-1320 could not utilize xylose and pectin. Another notable difference was in the growth temperature of DSM 6725. DSM 6725 strain could grow up to 90¬∞ Celsius while Z-1320 can grow up to 83¬∞ Celsius. These differences in the strains lead to the grouping of C. bescii.

Like 2005's Wimbledon Green, The G.N.B. Double C was taken from Seth's sketchbooks. Seth describes it as a companion book and prequel to Green but its insistent \\"Canadianness\\" and lack of plot seem to place it more alongside another work of Seth's, George Sprott. \\"The Great Northern Brotherhood of Canadian Cartoonists\\" referred to in the title is a fictional organization serving the Canadian comics community. Seth takes readers on a tour of \\"The G.N.B. Double C\\" building in the fictional town of Dominion, Ontario, and gives an overview of Canadian comics history along the way. This history, although mostly fictitious, does mention real cartoonists like Doug Wright, Jimmy Frise, Arch Dale, and Peter Whalley, all of whom were supposedly members of the Brotherhood. In Seth's alternate world, \\"Unlike other countries, Canadians (and their leaders) loved and supported cartooning\\". Publication history Seth began working on The G.N.B. Double C before his 2005 graphic novel Wimbledon Green but became frustrated with it and abandoned the project before it was finished. Originally Seth intended this story to be a personal project and did not draw it with readers in mind so when Tom Devlin of Drawn and Quarterly suggested publishing it, he wasn't sure. Eventually Seth agreed but, because he wasn't happy with a lot of the book, redrew about two-thirds of it over a two-month period. Plot summary The story opens with Seth walking down Milverton Street in Dominion, a fictional Ontario town Seth has used in other works, such as Clyde Fans. Located on this street is the local branch of the Great Northern Brotherhood of Canadian Cartoonists, a once proud institution now in decline. Seth takes readers on a tour of the building describing the Brotherhood's many prominent members and recounting the history of Canadian comics and their place in Canadian society. \\"Unlike other countries,\\" he says, \\"Canadians (and their leaders) loved and supported cartooning\\". The last stop on the tour is the roof. The door to the roof used to be left open but, after two members jumped off the roof, it's been kept locked. Seth looks down on the courtyard ‚Äì the fountain is filled with garbage, the statue vandalized ‚Äì and he admits that he exaggerated his account of history. Canadians never gave cartoonists any more respect than anyone else. Seth wonders if \\"this graphic novel thing\\" will catch on and hopes it will bring new members to the club.

The rugby union squad currently plays in Primera C, the fourth division of the URBA league system. History In 1965 a group of young rugby players thought of establishing a place where to play the sport they loved. Finally they founded the club on April 28, 1965, naming Oscar Bottone as president. The first meetings of the club were celebrated at diverse high schools of Monte Grande. That meetings later defined the name, colors and the pet of the club Monte Grande. In August, 1965, the club asked Argentine Rugby Union to be registered, being supported in that requirement by Lomas Athletic and Olivos. In 1966 the team disputed a number of friendly matches (demanded by the rules of the UAR) and on March 24 the club is officially affiliated to that institution and the team began to dispute the third division championship. The first official lineup was: Corchio, Hosteter, Drew, Lasalle y Galan; M√©ndez y G√≥mez Dura√±ona; Cavatorta, Guida y Canegallo; Torres Y Ruiz; Bottone, Cordeiro y Hern√°ndez. That team faced Club Central de Buenos Aires, winning 19-11. By those years a women's field hockey team was formed as well. They played in the same field that rugby union team. In 1974 the matches had to be played at Club Vialidad Nacional of Ezeiza, Buenos Aires, which field was rented by Monte Grande. The next year all divisions of the club were disbanded therefore Monte Grande could not dispute the 1975 and 1976 seasons. After some failed attempts to merge with other clubs, in 1982 Monte Grande won the promotion to \\"Tercera de Ascenso\\" (third division) and the club acquired a 30 hectares land to build its sports installations, which were finally opened in 1987.

Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but R. debilis, like other species of Roscoea, grows in much colder mountainous regions.  Description  Roscoea debilis is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \\"pseudostems\\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. Plants are usually tall, occasionally as short or as tall as . It has five to seven leaves. The first two or three consist only of pinkish brown sheaths; the remaining leaves have blades usually long by wide. The blades are narrowed at the base, appearing to form a stalk. At the junction of the blade and sheath there is a small pinkish brown ligule, extending to about . Flowers appear in June to August in the wild. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike (inflorescence) is either held within the leaf sheaths or sometimes slightly extended from them. One to three flowers open together and are purple, red or white. The narrow bracts which subtend the flowers are long, longer than the calyx. Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, long, with a two-lobed apex. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube, longer than the calyx at , terminating in three lobes, a hooded upright central lobe, about long and two similarly sized side lobes. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright petals, which are about long with a narrowed base; two central staminodes are fused to form a lip or labellum, long by about wide. The labellum bends slightly downwards and has a narrowed base for about 5‚Äì6 mm (0.2 in) after which there are some white lines. It is split into two narrow lobes at the end. The single functional stamen has a white anther, about long, with long spurs formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther. The ovary is long. Taxonomy Roscoea debilis was first described scientifically by Fran√ßois Gagnepain in a publication which appeared in 1902. The specific epithet debilis means \\"weak\\"; Gagnepain described it as \\"remarkable for its slenderness\\". Two varieties are recognized. R. debilis var. debilis has leaf blades which are softly hairy (pubescent) on the underside; in R. debilis var. limprichtii they are hairless (glabrous). Evolution and phylogeny The family Zingiberaceae is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea may have evolved relatively recently and be a response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. Species of Roscoea divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a \\"Chinese\\" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. R. debilis falls into the area of distribution of the Chinese clade, although it was not included in the analysis by Ngamriabsakul et al. Distribution and habitat Roscoea debilis occurs in Yunnan, China, growing at altitudes of in grassland.

The sitter is unknown, but possibly, was Reynolds's great-niece, Theophila Gwatkin (who was three in 1785 and six in 1788), or Lady Anne Spencer (1773‚Äì1865), the youngest daughter of the 4th Duke of Marlborough, who would have been twelve in 1785 and fifteen in 1788. The painting was presented to the National Gallery in 1847 by Robert Vernon and has hung in the Tate Britain since 1951. Genre The painting is a character study, or, in eighteenth-century terms, a fancy picture. It was painted over another Reynolds work, A Strawberry Girl, perhaps because the earlier painting had suffered some paint losses. Only the hands remain in their original state. Since 1859, deterioration of the overpainting also has been documented. Popularity The Age of Innocence became a favourite of the public and, according to Martin Postle, \\"the commercial face of childhood\\", was reproduced countless times in prints and ephemera of different kinds. No fewer than 323 full-scale replicas in oil were made by students and professional copyists between 1856 and 1893. The catchy name given to the painting after Reynold's death originated with Joseph Grozer in 1794, when he used that title for his stipple engraving of the work.British Museum, The Age of Innocence.

It's Indiana, you know.\\" Freshman season In his freshman year at Indiana, the 2009-10 season, Watford had an immediate impact and was one of only two players to start all 31 games. He led the team in rebounding (6.0/game), total blocks (19) and double-doubles (4).

West Florida became G√°lveztown, supposedly under the command of Bernardo de G√°lvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana (New Spain). There are claims that she participated in the siege and capture of Pensacola in March 1781. However, documentary evidence suggests that she arrived in Philadelphia with cargo on 1 June 1780, and therefore could not have participated in this action in March 1781.Raymond J. Martinez, Rousseau: The Last Days of Spanish New Orleans, Pelican Publishing, 2003, p.15 Historic significance The vessel, described as a two-masted brigantine, square-rigged on the foremast, with fore-and-aft sails on the mainmast,Gilbert C.

She had taken several American rebel smugglers as prizes under Lieutenant John Payne, RN. As such she posed a threat to the expected shipment of arms and military supplies that Benjamin Franklin had contracted from the Spanish firm of Jos√© Gardoqui & Sons to ship: \\"215 bronze cannon, 4,000 field tents, 12,826 grenades, 30,00 [3,000 or 30,000?] bayonets, 30,000 uniforms, 51,314 musket balls, and 300,000 pounds of gunpowder from a French port by way of Bermuda to Boston\\". Spain also provided almost eight million re√°les (currency) with which all types of supplies were purchased and sent by way of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to General Washington and George Rogers Clark.Robert Thonhoff, The Vital Contribution of Spain in the Winning of the American Revolution: An Essay on a Forgotten Chapter in the History of the American Revolution After intercepting a secret communication to the British General, G√°lvez formulated a plan to attack the British forces once Spain declared war on Britain. After HMS West Florida took three boats that the Spanish claimed to be theirs, the Spanish Governor used this as a pretext and reacted by seizing eleven British vessels on the river at the time, claiming them to be smugglers. One of the vessels was a British- registered Norton, captained by a colonial William Pickles. Hiring American rebels to capture the British vessel, on 10 September 1779 Captain William Pickles in Morris,James L.

James Dunwoody Brownson De Bow, De Bow's review, > Volume 17, J.D.B.

Overhauling West Florida, Pickles ordered her to surrender. The English captain, Payne, laughed at him. Shots were exchanged simultaneously.Walter Adolphe Roberts, Lake Pontchartrain, 1946, p.97 Account of the action suggests the British crew put up a significant resistance and surrendered only after her commander, Lieutenant John Payne, was mortally wounded in the engagement. Although she was rigged as a sloop-of-war, the new Spanish owners converted her to a square-rigged brig sloop.Sheldon Gardner, The Galveztown was an important vessel in Revolutionary War. Florida Times Union, July 26, 2011 Some confusion exists as to whether it was the former West Florida that joined the Spanish squadron for the attack on Pensacola, and later participated in the capture of Mobile, Alabama.John C. Fredriksen, The United States Marine Corps: A Chronology, 1775 to the Present, ABC-CLIO,2011, p.8 Fate It seems that Pickles was ordered to collect cargo of tafia and sugar, and deliver this to Philadelphia, his home port, immediately after her capture.Raymond J. Martinez, Rousseau: The Last Days of Spanish New Orleans, Pelican Publishing, 2003, p.14 Soon after she arrived at Philadelphia in June 1780 she was judged unsuitable for navigation, and sold.Raymond J. Martinez, Rousseau: The Last Days of Spanish New Orleans, Pelican Publishing, 2003, p.15. However, some claim that on 23 April 1789, G√°lveztown was the only foreign ship in New York Harbor, and saluted the first inauguration of George Washington. One such report says, \\"The ships at anchor in the harbor, dressed in colors, fired salvos as it passed. One alone, the Galveston, a Spanish man-of-war, displayed no signs of gratulation, until the barge of the general was nearly abreast; when suddenly as if by magic, the yards were manned, the ship burst forth, as it were, into a full array of flags and signals, and thundered a salute of thirteen guns.\\"Washington Irving, Life of George Washington, Volume 4, G.P. Putnam's sons, 1857, p.471 Standing at Washington's side at the presidential inaugural parade was Spain's first ambassador to the United States, Diego de Gardoqui, and perhaps this claim was made to link the Spanish campaign in the South with the president. Replica A replica of the brig was laid down in 2009 in Astilleros Nereo shipyards, close to the Ba√±os del Carmen, outside M√°laga, Spain, and is scheduled for launching in 2011. Tons of live oak were shipped from the U.S. to Spain to be used in the replica, including 17 tons from the Galveston area from the thousands of trees felled by Hurricane Ike.

It was released in the UK by Independent Artists (Production) Limited.John Hamilton, The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70, Hemlock Books, 2013, p 107-11. The film was written by Rex Carlton based on an idea by Jeffrey Stone. Its US release was in April 1964.  Plot  Dr. Mark Davidson (John Neville), the narrator, is in fear for his life. His predecessor died under mysterious circumstances just after making a major breakthrough. The cause of death (\\"an explosion inside his brain\\") is being withheld by Secret Service agent Major Clarke (Patrick Newell). The scientists are working on a project involving spaceflight by the power of mental concentration. Dr. Mark Davidson has a new Swiss wife, Julie (played by Gabriella Licudi), in whom Maj. Clarke takes an interest. Julie has a number of unusual characteristics, such as sleeping with her eyes open, never blinking and having no pulse, which makes her husband suspect she is an alien. She also frightens children and can handle very hot objects with her bare hands. After frightening a whole schoolyard of children, though, it emerges she can cry, though the tears burn her cheeks. Maj. Clarke does a background check and finds she never existed before her life with the doctor. As a precaution, Dr. Mark Davidson is relieved of his lab duties. With nothing else to do he works on the problem his precessor had figured out. He is able to recover the lost formula. For security reasons, Maj. Clarke confiscates the notes but is struck dead in the same mysterious way. Eventually, Julie confesses that she is an alien sent to kill her husband and that she must leave because she has failed, as she has fallen in love with him. Despite his pleas, she vanishes, leaving only an empty dress. He rushes into his office and makes the tape which narrates the film, warning that aliens want to prevent the breakthrough. He is then interrupted by his secretary, who announces she is also an alien and she is there to finish the assignment. A scuffle ensues and she is pushed out of a window but only an empty dress lands on the pavement. The scientists rush downstairs and are quietly surrounded by a crowd of grim-visaged women, all of whom seem to be aliens.

Batman Beyond Main characters * Terry McGinnis (voiced by Will Friedle) - The current Batman and a former juvenile delinquent. Under the pretense of doing errands for Bruce, Terry fights crime as the new Batman. Terry was chosen to be the new Dark Knight as he shared a similar loss as Bruce had; that being the death of a parent. * Bruce Wayne (voiced by Kevin Conroy) - The original Batman, he is Terry's employer, mentor, and predecessor. During his final mission as Batman, Bruce suffered a heart attack that forced him to use a gun in self-defense; abhorred by this, he hung up his cape and cowl. * Maxine \\"Max\\" Gibson (voiced by Cree Summer) - A genius high schooler and friend of Terry's. She discovers his secret identity early on in the series, and from then on occasionally helps Batman in an \\"Alfred\\"-type role, though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor (but less so as time went on). Her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister. * Ace (voiced by Frank Welker) - Bruce Wayne's pet, the billionaire rescued and took in the stray Great Dane after the canine defended him from a Jokerz thug at Crime Alley during one of Wayne's annual visits there in memory of his slain parents. Fiercely loyal to Bruce, he eventually develops a bond with Terry. Terry's family * Warren McGinnis and Mary McGinnis (voiced by Michael Gross and Teri Garr) - Terry and Matt's divorced parents. Warren was murdered by Mr. Fixx at the start of the series. Terry moves in with his mother after his father's death. Mary believes that Terry works as an errand boy for Bruce. In the rebooted universe, Mary was killed during the Futures End crossover. * Matt McGinnis (voiced by Ryan O'Donohue) - Terry's younger brother. Always looking to get his brother in trouble, Matt is ironically a big fan of Batman. In the rebooted universe, Matt finds out about Terry's secret and becomes an invaluable ally to Batman. He eventually becomes the new Robin. Recurring characters * Dana Tan (voiced by Lauren Tom) - Terry's girlfriend. She had a hard time accepting his responsibilities as Bruce Wayne's employee initially, but became more understanding regarding his frequent absences. In both the original comics and the rebooted universe, she discovers Terry's secret. Later on, it is revealed during the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\" that Terry was going to propose to her. * Barbara Gordon (voiced by Stockard Channing in 1999-2000, Angie Harmon in 2000, Tara Strong as the young Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker) - The no-nonsense Gotham City police commissioner and the former Batgirl. She was the daughter of the former Gotham City police commissioner, James Gordon. No longer the beautiful, dashing young heroine she once was, having been hardened and determined through the years of personal tragedy to her friends, the new Commissioner Gordon is not entertained by the notion of Batman's heir and often clashes with Terry, though time helps her to realize his value to Neo-Gotham. Unlike most Batman universes, she has never lost the use of her legs or become the Oracle, although the event that in the comics led her to become the latter was referenced in the episode \\"A Touch of Curar√©\\". It is also implied that she had an affair with Bruce that ended badly. * Melanie Walker (voiced by Olivia d'Abo) - A member of the Royal Flush Gang by the name of Ten, she is an on-off love interest of Terry McGinnis, similar to Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, but without Melanie knowing that Terry is Batman. * Sam Young (voiced by Paul Winfield) - A Gotham district attorney and Barbara's husband. * Howard Groote (voiced by Max Brooks) - A nerdy student at Hamilton Hill High School and a friend of Terry. His design was based on producer Paul Dini. * Bobbi \\"Blade\\" Sommer (voiced by Melissa Disney) - A popular student at Terry's school. She never has a steady boyfriend and occasionally goes out with different boys. Blade is seen to be friends with Terry, Dana, Max and Howard. * Chelsea Cunningham (voiced by Yvette Lowental in 1999-2000, Rachael Leigh Cook in 2000) - Another Hamilton High student, she is the best friend of Dana and Terry and the former girlfriend and crush of Nelson. * Nelson Nash (voiced by Seth Green) - An athlete and bully at Terry's school, who eventually matures and becomes more friendly during the series. He seems to be popular with the girls, but never has a steady girlfriend. He is very similar, both physically and mentally, to Flash Thompson from the Spider- Man universe, given his adversarial-turned-friendly relationship with Terry and his admiration for Batman. Supporting characters * Justice League Unlimited - The series' incarnation of the Justice League. ** Superman (voiced by Christopher McDonald) - Kal-El, the Last Son of Krypton. The Man of Steel is still dedicating his life to fight for truth and justice, both in his superhero persona and as the mild-mannered journalist Clark Kent. In the rebooted universe, Superman is Clark's adult son Jonathan. ** Aquagirl (voiced by Jodi Benson) - Marina is the Atlantean princess and daughter of the now missing Aquaman. ** Big Barda (voiced by Farrah Forke) - A former member of the Female Furies of Apokolips . ** Green Lantern (voiced by Lauren Tom) - An Asian boy, Kai-ro, is the latest to be chosen by the Green Lantern Corps to protect Space Sector 2814. ** Micron (voiced by Wayne Brady) - An African American superhero who carries the legacy of Professor Ray Palmer, otherwise known as the Atom. This enables him to grow and shrink in size ** Warhawk (voiced by Peter Onorati) - Rex Stewart, the son of two of the League's founding members, John Stewart (Green Lantern) and Shayera Hol (Hawkgirl), and a successor of Hawkman. * Infiltration Unit Zeta (voiced by Gary Cole in the first appearance, Diedrich Bader in later appearances) - An assassination android who unexpectedly develops a conscience, Zeta gave up his killing ways after he realizes how precious life is, and goes on the run as a fugitive from the government. Zeta became the protagonist of a spin-off series, The Zeta Project. ** Rosalie \\"Ro\\" Rowen (voiced by Julie Nathanson) - A teenage runaway who joins Zeta in his quest to prove his innocence. Villains * Derek Powers / Blight (voiced by Sherman Howard) - A ruthless businessman, whose company Powers Technology merged with Wayne Enterprises years before, around the time of Wayne's retirement as Batman. After accidentally becoming exposed to a biological weapon of his own making, Powers is treated with radiation and becomes the radioactive supervillain known as Blight. ** Mr. Fixx (voiced by George Takei) Derek Powers' right-hand man who is responsible for Warren McGinnis' murder under his employer's orders. Fixx is killed in a plane crash. ** Paxton Powers (voiced by Cary Elwes in \\"Ascension,\\" Parker Stevenson in \\"King's Ransom\\") - The estranged son of Derek Powers, who takes over his father's position as Wayne-Powers CEO after he secretly arranges the public exposure that reveals the elder Powers' identity as the supervillain Blight; however, Paxton is also as ruthless and power-hungry as his father. Eventually, after numerous schemes Batman opposed, Powers was arrested after his collusion with the Royal Flush Gang was exposed and Bruce Wayne re-assumed control of his company. * The Jokerz - A violent street gang who dress and act out in the tradition of the infamous Joker; however, unlike the supervillain they emulate, they are merely teenage delinquents who enjoy vandalism and petty crime. They are usually apprehended by Batman quite easily and serve as more of an irritation to the hero than a genuine threat. Despite this, they are a genuine problem for the city of Gotham, and their criminal activities and constant harassment of innocent citizens are one of the first signs that show how much worse things have gotten for the city after the original Batman's retirement. There have been three different versions of the Jokerz. The first group of Jokerz seen was introduced in the series premiere \\"Rebirth\\", committing petty pranks and harassment before being framed for the murder of Terry's father. They have appeared throughout the series since. The second group of Jokerz was introduced in the episode \\"Hidden Agenda\\", shown committing more violent and arsonist acts than the first group. They have appeared throughout the series since, with the exception of Terminal. The third group of Jokerz was introduced in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker where they worked for what appeared to be the original Joker. They later appeared in an episode of Justice League Unlimited, now working for Chronos and enhanced with super powers. When Chronos is defeated, this timeline is erased. ** J-Man (voiced by Bruce Timm) - Dresses very similarly to the original Joker. Bruce Timm is the producer for the DCAU shows, and joked in the DVD commentary that his performance as J-Man was 'Emmy-Award winning material'. ** Dottie (voiced by Lauren Tom in the first appearance, Cree Summer in later appearances) - A member of the Jokerz who wears a polka-dot dress. She wields a rubber chicken with spikes on it. ** Smirk (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum) - J-Man's \\"right-hand clown.\\" ** Coe (voiced by Scott Valentine) - A member of the Jokerz who wears a jester's hat and a jacket with one of the sleeves ripped off. He wields a baseball bat. ** Spike (voiced by Joe Lala in the first appearance, Mark Slaughter in later appearances) - A member of the Jokerz who wears a green trench-coat and carries an acid-laced cream pie with him. ** Scab (voiced by Marc Worden) - A member of the Jokerz that wears a red single-coned jester's cap. Scab was possibly inspired by Harley Quinn. He wears a giant boxing glove on his right hand. ** Top Hat (voiced by Bruce Timm) - A member of the Jokerz that wears an outfit that is similar to the DCAU version of the Penguin. ** Lee (voiced by Ethan Embry) - A student at Hamilton Hill High School. He dropped out to join the Jokerz. When Scab and Coe stole an experimental aircraft during his initiation, he began to doubt his dreams to be a member of the Jokerz. When the reactor became unstable, he knocked out Scab and shut the reactor. Lee then left the Jokerz afterwards. ** Carter Wilson / Terminal (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum) - Carter Wilson is a popular and genius student at Hamilton Hill High School who was obsessed with being the best at everything he did. He led the second group of Jokerz in an attempt to kill Maxine Gibson, who had scored higher on an important test than he had, and was going to be voted Class Valedictorian instead of him. Terminal's vendetta against Max and the subsequent intervention by Batman led to Max's realization of Terry's secret identity. Terminal later appears in the rebooted universe trying to revive a dying Bruce Wayne in order to gain access to his Keytone data network. He disguises Bruce as the Joker in order to gain influence and control over the Jokerz. He is later killed by the real Joker, who had been aiding him in his scheme.Batman Beyond (vol. 8) #5 ** Trey (voiced by Omar Gooding) - Terminal's \\"right-hand clown.\\" He dropped out of school in the 6th grade to join the Jokerz. He used to be a member of J-Man's gang, but eventually joined up with Terminal's gang afterwards. ** Tayko (voiced by Cree Summer) - A member of Terminal's gang who is an amazing gymnast. ** Weasel (voiced by Will Friedle) - Known for his high-pitched holler, Weasel carries a flail around and has many other weapons in his jacket. He used to be a member of J-Man's branch of the Jokerz, but joined Terminal's branch later on. ** Bonk (voiced by Henry Rollins in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Adam Baldwin in Justice League Unlimited) - A powerful, but surly enforcer/muscleman in the Jokerz' ranks. Though amazingly strong, Bonk is not a thug who takes orders willingly (especially if it has to do with swiping what he calls \\"a lot of geek junk\\" instead of cash). He has a hair-trigger and is liable to start up with anyone who gets in his way, be it Batman or Bonk's own Jokerz allies. This is his undoing when he argues with the Joker, accusing him of being a fake. In return, the Joker murders him either with a venomous spear gun disguised as a BANG! flag gun, or with laughing gas (depending on the unedited or edited version of the film). He appears during the Justice League Unlimited multi-part episode \\"The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2\\" equipped with a massive hammer that comes out of his arm. He is able to deliver massive damage with this weapon. ** Chucko (voiced by Don Harvey) - Obese with tight-fitting pink clothes and a clown mask, he is a nasty bullying type who truly enjoys inflicting misery on others. A head enforcer for the Jokerz, he is a lot stronger and faster than his flabby gut would lead one to believe. True to his sadistic nature, Chucko's face is always hidden behind his mocking clown mask (aside from the heist at Wayne Enterprises, where he was wearing a gas mask). He uses a bazooka as a weapon. An alternate-time stream version of Chucko appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2\\". He appears here with a hovering ball instead of his normal legs and carries a lightsaber-like object. The ball offers more maneuverability than he previously had with his legs and the saber adds extra \\"oomph.\\" He betrays Chronos by tipping off the Justice League Unlimited and is sent back to the prehistoric age at the moment when the meteor that killed the dinosaurs arrived. This incident serves as a warning to the other members of the Jokerz. ** Dee Dee (voiced by Melissa Joan Hart) - The identical twin granddaughters of Harley Quinn and an unnamed individual. Delia and Deidre Dennis (often referred to by the collective name \\"Dee Dee\\" or simply, \\"the Deeds\\") are cute, charming, funny, and completely rotten to the core. They love the thrill of being part of the Jokerz and think it is a large charge to be working for the big man himself, the Joker. They use an acrobatics-based fighting style very similar to Harley's. They fight in unison, acting almost like one person controlling two bodies, even finishing each other's sentences. They are imprisoned at the end of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, but bailed out by their grandmother, the former Harley Quinn, whom they refer to as \\"Nana Harley.\\" They appear in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2\\" with the power to multiply themselves upon impact. They also carry an energy whip, which electrocutes the victim on contact. This whip is what led to Terry and Kai-Ro's alternate deaths until this timeline was erased. It had been assumed that they were the Joker's biological granddaughters; however, events that take place in Batman and Harley Quinn strongly suggest that they are in fact the biological granddaughters of Dick Grayson and Harley Quinn. ** Ghoul (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum impersonating Christopher Walken) - He wears ragged clothing and has grey skin, numerous stitching/scar marks and skull-like features; possibly he genetically altered his appearance to make himself look undead. His appearance vaguely mimics that of previous Batman nemesis the Scarecrow. A jaded young runaway from a wealthy home, Ghoul joined up with the Jokerz for kicks. He is heavily into techno-goth music and has adapted the horror look into his costume. Ghoul is never without his plastic Halloween pumpkin, which he keeps filled with a number of monster-inspired weapons and tricks. Ghoul eventually returned in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2\\". He is now armed with a spinning blade in his right arm, which he can deploy or retract at will. It is also revealed in this episode that he wet the bed until he was 14. ** Woof (voiced by Frank Welker in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Dee Bradley Baker in Justice League Unlimited) - Woof was just a nameless underling in the Jokerz until he decided to try gene-splicing. Infusing his cellular structure with that of a spotted hyena, Woof quickly transformed (some say devolved) into the giggling, bestial nightmare that he is today. Though he sometimes appears to be nothing more than the Jokerz' comical mascot, Woof's crushing jaws, sharp teeth, and razor-like claws make him a deadly adversary. He appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2\\". In this appearance, he is equipped with cybernetic arms, which allow him to run faster than he previously could. The arms are also able to gouge materials as hard as concrete and steel, as they are sharper and sturdier than his claws once were. * Inque (voiced by Shannon Kenny) - Treated with a mutagen, Inque has the ability to turn her body into a black ink-like liquid. She is a freelance saboteur. Inque is shown to be vulnerable to immersion in water (which can disperse her substance and hampers her ability to re-form) and freezing temperatures, the latter of which is how she is kept imprisoned after being apprehended. She is based on Clayface.https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/battles-7/inque-vs- clayface-19128/ She has a daughter named Deanna Clay (voiced by Azura Skye) from whom she is estranged. * Willie Watt (voiced by Scott McAfee) - A nerd at Hamilton Hill High who was constantly picked on by bullies at school, has unrequited feelings for Bobbi, and forced to deal with his overbearing father at home. Seeking revenge, he stole a mentally-controlled robot called the GoLeM (Galvanized Lifting Machine) from his father's construction company and used it to attack his tormentors, but the machine was destroyed by Batman and he was sent to juvenile detention for three years. However, his experience with the GoLeM caused him to develop powerful psychokinetic abilities, which he uses to bring terror to his fellow detainees and secretly leave and return to the facility at will. He attempted revenge on his schoolmates again by using his powers to convince everyone the school was haunted. Despite having been defeated by Batman once more, Willie's powers remain active. He is also somewhat friendly to Terry McGinnis since he was not one of his tormentors; not knowing that Terry and his enemy, Batman, are the same person. * Mister Freeze (voiced by Michael Ansara) - The tragic villain lives on as nothing but an immortal head preserved by Derek Powers; used as a test subject in an attempt to clone a new body for Powers. However, Freeze's new body begins to suffer the same symptoms as his previous body. After Powers' scientist tries to eliminate Freeze to study the problem, he seeks revenge, leading to a final battle with Derek Powers' alter ego, Blight, and Batman as well. Driven past the breaking point by losing his life a second time, Freeze finally commits suicide by overloading a reactor and sealing off the building, dying in the ensuing explosion. * The Terrific Trio: A group of scientists tragically transformed into superpowered beings during an apparent lab accident. At first, they tried to use their powers for the benefit of society, but their conditions slowly drove them into insanity. When they discovered that their mutations are irreversible and the accident had been set up by one of their coworkers, Doctor Hodges, they set out to get revenge. In the attempt, they were defeated by Batman, who trapped the 2-D Man and Freon in a ventilation system and used a water hose on Magma. The Terrific Trio are based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Fantastic Four. ** Doctor Mike Morgan / Magma (voiced by Robert Davi) - A hulking magma-like monster of a man. ** Mary Michaels / Freon (voiced by Laura San Giacomo) - A gaseous woman with ice-like powers. In the rebooted universe, Doctor Hodges resurrects Freon at the cost of his life. Freon attempts to get revenge on Gotham by turning the city's defense system against itself, but she is stopped by Batman, Shriek, and Hacker. ** Stewart Lowe / the 2-D Man (voiced by Jeff Bennett) - A flat individual with stretching capabilities. * Walter Shreeve / Shriek (voiced by Chris Mulkey) - Walter Shreeve is initially a sound engineer hoping to improve society with his inventions. He is led down a decidedly darker path by Derek Powers, who wants a return on his investment in Shreeve's research. He thus dubs him \\"Shriek\\", based on his special suit which allows him to generate destructive sound waves and manipulate sound in a wide variety of ways. During a fight with Batman, his suit is damaged, causing it to pick up sounds at such a high volume that Shreeve is rendered permanently deaf. Though he develops a special headset to hear normally, the incident drives him insane and vengeful against Batman, returning several times using his technology to seek revenge against him. Shriek later makes a cameo appearance in the Justice League Unlimited episode ‚ÄúEpilogue‚Äù as part of the Iniquity Collective. Voiced by Chris Mulkey. ** Ollie (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum) - A splicer of indetermiate species who serves as Shriek‚Äôs henchman and main ally in his crusade against Batman. Ollie is addicted to ‚Äúthe fork‚Äù, a tuning fork-like device invented by Shriek that stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain. In the rebooted universe, Shriek escapes prison after Brother Eye's world conquest and becomes the self-appointed protector of the people that still live in the tunnels. * Charlie \\"Big Time\\" Bigelow (voiced by Stephen Baldwin in the first appearance, Clancy Brown in the second appearance) A loudmouth hoodlum and a former friend of Terry McGinnis. Three years prior to Terry becoming Batman, Charlie was arrested for burglary and sentenced to three years in prison. It is revealed that Terry was also arrested during the burglary, but avoided prison because he was underage at the time, and that Terry's early life of petty crime was largely the result of Charlie's negative influence. Charlie attempts to reconnect with Terry after he is released, but is rebuffed due to his continuing criminal behavior. Charlie later becomes involved with a gang of thieves-for-hire who plan to rob a Wayne-Powers research lab to steal an experimental chemical for a rival company. During the robbery, Terry (as Batman) intervenes. Charlie is exposed to the chemical during the fight, and later mutates into a deformed super-strong giant; an event which leaves Terry wracked with guilt. Big Time later returns in ‚ÄúBetrayal‚Äù, trying to take over the Neo-Gotham underworld and kidnapping Terry so he could join him. Big Time falls to his apparent death during a fight with Batman at the end of the episode. He is based on the second Blockbuster. * Richard \\"Richie\\" Armacost (voiced by Robert Patrick) - A top executive at the agricultural company Agri-Chem who was jailed for insider trading. He met and befriended Big Time while in prison and talked him into a job. ** Karros (voiced by William H. Macy) - A mercenary and high-tech specialist employed by Agri-Chem. * The Royal Flush Gang - A future incarnation of the group. They are all Spades. This version of the Royal Flush Gang consists of a crime family of five members: ** Mr. Walker as King (voiced by George Lazenby) - ** Mrs. Walker as Queen (voiced by Amanda Donohoe and later by Sarah Douglas) - ** Melanie Walker as Ten (voiced by Olivia d'Abo) - See above. ** Jack Walker as Jack (voiced by Scott Cleverdon and later Nicholas Guest) - Son of Mr. and Mrs. Walker. ** Ace - An android who serves as their bodyguard. * Bane: In the years since Bruce Wayne's retirement from crimefighting, Bane's constant use of the super-steroid Venom has destroyed his body; leaving him a withered, wheelchair-bound husk of a man kept alive by the very drug that once gave him superhuman strength. When someone begins selling Venom-laced \\"slapper\\" patches to teenagers, it is discovered that Bane's personal attendant Jackson Chappell (voiced by Larry Drake) has the formula and is mass-producing it. During a battle with Batman, Chappell overdoses on the slapper patches, which put him into a coma. * Ira Billings / the Spellbinder (voiced by Jon Cypher) - Ira Billings is a bitter and underpaid psychologist at Terry's high school who commits crimes using sophisticated virtual reality systems and his knowledge of the human mind. In the rebooted universe, the Spellbinder brainwashes Terry after the latter's supposed death into becoming the new Rewire, while Tim Drake becomes the new Batman Beyond. He is eventually defeated by Drake. * The Society of Assassins - A secret group of assassins. ** The Master Assassin (voiced by Victor Rivers) - A man named Devon is the head of the Society of Assassins. ** Curar√© (vocal effects provided by Melissa Disney) - A member of the Society of Assassins, \\"their best\\" (according to Bruce Wayne, Curar√©'s at- the-time boss, and the FBI), who wields a laser-sharpened scimitar that can cut through any material and never speaks. After Batman foils her attempt to assassinate Gotham's DA, she ends up becoming a target of the Society herself, resulting in Curar√© ultimately killing every member of the Society of Assassins. In the rebooted universe, Curar√© arrives in Gotham to warn Batman about the League of Assassins' plans under the leadership of the new Ra's Al Ghul. Unlike the animated series, she does engage in conversation with her allies and opponents. ** Mutro Botha (voiced by Tim Curry) - The last surviving member of the Society of Assassins, who tries to blackmail Batman into protecting him from Curar√©. * Doctor Abel Cuvier (voiced by Ian Buchanan) - A doctor who starts a trend in infusing animal biology with human DNA known as \\"splicing.\\" Using his research to commit crimes before ending up on the wanted list, Cuvier mutates himself into a genetic chimera to battle Batman before getting a massive overdose that further mutates him into a monster and apparently dies when he accidentally ignites several gas tanks, causing a massive explosion. Though the technology of splicing becomes outlawed shortly after his presumed death, it continues to surface as an illegal subculture throughout the series. In the two-part episode \\"The Curse of the Kobra,\\" it is hinted that he is a member of Kobra. In the rebooted universe, he is one of Brother Eye's allies and battles Tim Drake. ** The Ramrod (voiced by Ice-T) - A delinquent spliced with ram DNA and one of Cuvier's henchmen.

The Earthmover later commits suicide by bringing down the cavern he resides in on top of himself. * Robert Vance (voiced by Stacy Keach) - After uploading his mind into his company's computer systems before his death, Robert Vance plans to resurrect himself by downloading his virtual consciousness into the body of one of his descendants. His consciousness is deleted and his mind regresses into nothing in a manner similar to HAL 9000. * The Stalker (voiced by Carl Lumbly) - An African big game hunter who was enhanced with cybernetic implants after an encounter with a black panther that broke his spine in five places. Finding wild animals too easy to hunt with his new body, he seeks Batman as the ultimate prey and proves to be one of his more difficult opponents. The Stalker was later used by Bennett to work with Batman in hunting False-Face. In the rebooted universe, the Stalker was hired by Payback to capture Batman. He only agreed to do so because his village was on the brink of extinction, thanks to Brother Eye's attacks. After aiding Batman in his fight against Payback, Terry brings Wayne Enterprises resources to the Stalker's village to save his people. * Mad Stan (voiced by Henry Rollins) - A rabidly anti-government terrorist who rebels against what he sees as a corrupt system.

He later kidnaps Dana, taking her to his home in the sewers and confessing his love for her, but she rebuffs him and he angrily commands an army of rats to kill her. After Batman saves her, he is caught in an explosion and presumed dead. * The Brain Trust: A group of villainous psychics who forcibly recruits children with mental talents. ** Bombshell (voiced by Kate Jackson) - A member of the infamous Brain Trust, Bombshell possesses the ability to fire projectiles from her hand.

Instead of helping troubled teenagers, however, he breaks their will by putting them in the ISO (an isolation room) and collects huge sums of money from their guardians.

He later realizes the error of his ways and assists Batman in defeating one of his employers before he is apparently sent to jail, although it is implied that his heroic actions will lead to a reduced sentence. Voiced by Dorian Harewood. * Ian Peek (voiced by Michael McKean) - The host of \\"The Inside Peek\\", a popular tabloid newscast, Ian Peek uses an experimental vibra-space belt that allows him to phase through solid objects, enabling him to uncover any celebrity's secrets and use them to boost ratings on his show. Ian exposed boxing trainer Jack Turley's affair with the champion's girlfriend, Jamie Jerald splicing herself with snake DNA to give herself a forked tongue, and Paxton Powers neglecting work. He nearly reveals both Terry and Bruce's secret lives as Batman, but the device alters his body's molecular structure, causing him to become permanently intangible and falling through the Earth despite Terry trying to save him. Bruce suspects that he will hit the Earth's core. * Ma Mayhem (voiced by Kathleen Freeman) - Ma Mayhem is the leader of a dysfunctional family of thieves. ** Carl and Slim (voiced by Mark Rolston and Andy Dick respectively) - The sons of Ma Mayhem. * Kobra - A terrorist organization bent on world domination.

It was discovered that April was in on it all along. ** Bullwhip (voiced by Jason Nash) - The leader of a gang of delinquents known by the fandom as the April Moon Gang, whose real name is Harold. He blackmailed Doctor Peter Corso into giving him and his friends cybernetic enhancements by kidnapping his wife; with Bullwhip receiving retractable metal whips in his wrists. After Corso discovers Bullwhip had an affair with his wife, Bullwhip comes back for an upgrade unaware of Corso's discovery and it is heavily implied Corso kills him. ** Terrapin (voiced by Ethan Embry) - A heavyset and muscular teenager and a member of the April Moon Gang. His enhancements enabled him to cover his body in a full suit of metal armor resembling a robot, though it restricted his mobility, agility, and sight.

The boy is able to build his own powered exoskeleton armed with an advanced laser cutter and takes the costumed persona of \\"Payback.\\" Believing himself to be a superhero standing up for children, Kenny tries to imitate his idol: Batman. In the rebooted universe, Kenny was sent to juvenile detention after being defeated by Batman.

Tim's kidnapping and torture by the Joker and Harley Quinn years ago as the Boy Wonder has left him traumatized and retired from crimefighting, leaving him struggling to keep his sanity intact from his ordeal. He now works as a communications engineer and has settled down with a wife and family. In the rebooted universe, a time-displaced Tim Drake from the Futures End timeline briefly succeeds Terry as the new Batman Beyond. Voiced by Dean Stockwell and Mathew Valencia as the young Tim Drake / Robin. Villains * The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) The evil and sly Clown Prince of Crime who only appears in the 2000 direct-to-video feature Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. In this feature, Joker kidnaps and then implants a microchip containing his DNA and consciousness in Tim Drake, allowing him to transform the former Boy Wonder into a clone of himself every bit as ruthless and cunning as the original. During the movie, the Joker's deepest ambition is revealed: to make Batman laugh as a sign of the respect he hungers for, but Terry McGinnis, the new Batman, freed Tim by destroying the microchip that the Joker implanted in Tim's mind. In the rebooted universe, the Joker survived his supposed final encounter with the original Batman and killed several members of the Jokerz for stealing his image. He recruits a couple of them and rebrands them as \\"the Throwbacks\\" to take on the new Batman and Robin. The Joker captures Robin and uses him to discover Bruce was the original Batman. He battles Bruce one last time in the Batcave before dying of a heart attack, but his corpse at the morgue was stolen by an elderly Harley Quinn. * Harley Quinn (voiced by Arleen Sorkin) - The henchgirl/lover of the Joker. Because of the Joker's death in the last confrontation with the original Batman and Batgirl, Harley went into hiding, which left her enemies to assume that she had died. She later reappears as an elderly woman, revealed to be the grandmother of Delia and Deidre Dennis (Dee Dee) and apparently reformed. Harley scolds Dee Delia and Deidre when they are released into her custody while awaiting trial. * Jordan Pryce (voiced by Mark Hamill) - An executive at the newly-rebuilt Wayne Enterprises, he harbors hatred towards Bruce Wayne because his return ruins Pryce's chance of taking over Wayne-Powers as its CEO.

Wanting revenge against the superhero community, Jatts tries to steal Mark Mandrill's metachem wand, but accidentally absorbs its energies into his hand, giving him the power to change elements by touch and becomes the new Matter Master. * The Joker King - Dana Tan's troubled brother who worships the late Clown Prince of Crime and desires to follow his footsteps. Doug Tan becomes a leader of the Jokerz, calling himself the Joker King and leading the Jokerz to cause chaos in Neo- Gotham City. The Joker King is also obsessed with triumphing over Batman, who had defeated his idol in the recent past and wants to rectify it by killing the victor. After the battle with Batman and his allies, the Joker King's reign of terror ends when his foot is caught by some rope and he falls off the ledge. The swing from the rope causes Doug's body to slam against the concrete wall of an unfinished building. The trauma inflicted to Doug's head kills him instantly. His liver is donated by his family to Bruce Wayne, who was dying at the time and in need of a transplant. * Rebel One - The secret leader of hacker collective Undercloud. She grew up on Level 2 of Neo-Gotham and resented the people that lived in the higher levels. Her father died from poison inhalation, working long hours at a Carbon Conversion Plant.

Her goal is to make everyone equal in poverty. * Rewire - Possessing the power to control his body's bioelectrical impulses, Davis Dusk, son of Gotham Mayor William Dusk, was secretly treated for mental illness to avoid political controversy for the Mayor. He deceives his doctors into thinking his therapy worked while actually planning the murder of his father by disrupting his pacemaker through a telephone. His powers are amplified by a mixture of Venom and Joker venom created by Ghoul. Davis is eventually brought down by a containment device that regulates the electrical impulses that his father had built before his death. In the rebooted universe, the Spellbinder brainwashes Terry into believing he is Davis Dusk and the new Rewire. * The Man-Bat - After the original Batman helped rescue his wife Francine from her own Man-Bat metamorphosis (see the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Terror in the Sky\\"), Kirk Langstrom had vowed to never again take the serum that had nearly destroyed his life. After he swore off genetic research, and with funding from Wayne Enterprises, both he and Francine became pioneers in the field of sonics and acoustics. Kirk somehow also discovered that Bruce Wayne was Batman years ago when he funded Kirk's sonic research. Though both Kirk and Francine were happily married for years and eventually had a son and a daughter named Max and Michelle, Francine eventually begins to suffer from Parkinson's disease and Kirk's relationship with his children begins to deteriorate.

I. cubes that are present in everyone's homes to turn Neo-Gotham against Batman, but fails and is put in Arkham Asylum when she sees herself as no one but the Scarecrow. Others * Doctor Nora Reid ( Elliot) - A granddaughter of the apparently- deceased Doctor Thomas Elliot, geneticist Doctor Nora Elliot-Reid seeks to amend her paternal grandfather's sins as the criminal mastermind Hush by working for Amanda Waller. Reid inadvertently created a successor who would carry on his legacy by cloning one of the original Batman's partners. It is believed that her grandfather died as Hush after his last battle with the original Dark Knight Detective. However, despite the official police report confirming the body's identity, Elliot's reputation as a master tactician and skilled surgeon had left his enemies in doubt of whether it really belonged to the villain. Because of the Elliot family's history of depravity and deception, many also doubt whether Doctor Reid is really as decent as she seems to be. * Undercloud - A collective of internet users who blackmail Max Gibson into joining. Undercloud is a loose collective of over 1,000 hackers, operating 'in the dark' so that no one member can endanger the entire collective. While the members think they are equal partners, the collective is secretly run by Rebel One.

Lucius Jr. now serves as Wayne's business partner after he and Wayne merged their companies as Wayne Incorporated. * Vigilante - Jake Chill is a great-grandnephew of Joe Chill, the mugger who murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill is also a former security guard of Wayne-Powers who worked under Derek Powers' right-hand-man Mr. Fixx. His employment by Powers had led Chill down the same path as his great-granduncle's: by killing Warren McGinnis under Mr. Fixx's orders, leaving him wracked with guilt towards the McGinnises and repeating history again by indirectly creating a Batman. After Bruce Wayne reclaimed his family's company, he fired Chill after he had been discovered to have worked at Powers' \\"Quiet Squad\\", aware of Chill's relation to his parents' killer and his possible involvement in Warren McGinnis' murder. His termination also drove Chill towards poverty. Seeing Batman as an inspiration, Chill sets to become a vigilante himself to atone for his family's sins.Batman Beyond Unlimited #5 (June 2012) He called himself Vigilante and worked with Batman to stop a Jokerz riot led by Doug Tan.Batman Beyond Unlimited #8 (September 2012) He is eventually killed by the Jokerz and the Phantasm (who was sent to kill him by Waller to prevent Batman from doing so after Terry discovered his identity). His death led to Terry ending his partnership with Bruce, as Bruce did not inform Terry about Chill's past.Batman Beyond 2.0 #25-31 * The Hacker - In the rebooted universe, Bo Han was a young technological genius who gained the ability to hack nearly any technology with his hands during Brother Eye's invasion. He becomes a new vigilante known as the Hacker and protects the Chinatown district of Neo-Gotham.Batman Beyond (vol. 7) #13 =Justice Lords= In the parallel universe where the Justice Lords reside, the original Lord Batman has long died after fighting Lord Superman, Lady Wonder Woman, and their tyrannical followers. In the future of that world, Bruce Wayne's absence affected those who were closest to him and, in addition, those who would have been if he was still alive: * Terrance \\"T\\" McGinnis (Justice Lords) - Terrence \\"T\\" McGinnis is in a relationship with the former Royal Flush Gang member Ten (Melanie Walker), and without Bruce Wayne‚Äôs guidance, he remains a delinquent and is a member of the Jokerz alongside his lover. After T. meets his heroic counterpart, he begins to question his purpose in life.Batman Beyond Universe #9 (April 2014) After the Justice Lords' defeat, T. is inspired to become the new Batman, with Dick Grayson as his mentor. Unlike his counterpart, T. is not driven by the tragic death of his father (whose murder never occurred in this world), but by Lord Superman's unjust actions upon the world.Batman Beyond Universe #12 (July 2014) * Mary McGinnis (Justice Lords) - Suffering former wife of Warren McGinnis and mother of T. McGinnis.Batman Beyond Universe #9 (April 2014) * Dick Grayson (Justice Lords) - Like his counterpart, Grayson also served as Lord Batman's partner as Robin and later Nightwing. However, due to the Joker being lobotomized by Lord Superman years before, Grayson never sustained an injury resulting in the loss of an eye, as did his counterpart. In turn, his successor Tim Drake never gave up being Robin and went on to become the Red Robin until Lord Batman's death forced both Grayson and Drake to retire from superheroics. In addition, Grayson married Barbara Gordon and worked as a high-ranking officer to the Justice Lords' task force. However, Dick did not allow Gotham to completely descend into a totalitarian state like the rest of the world.Batman Beyond Universe #9 (April 2014) Terry McGinnis' arrival inspired Grayson to continue his late mentor's mission and to groom McGinnis' counterpart into the new Batman.Batman Beyond Universe #12 (July 2014) * Barbara Gordon (Justice Lords) - Wife of Dick Grayson.Batman Beyond Universe #10 (May 2014) Like her husband, Barbara also previously served as Lord Batman's partner as Batgirl, but unlike her counterpart, Barbara was never romantically involved with Bruce Wayne (who was happily married to Wonder Woman prior to his death), and thus never indirectly caused the disintegration between Dick's bond with his mentor. She and Dick are happily married and they have a son. * John Grayson II - Young son of Dick Grayson and Barbara Gordon.Batman Beyond Universe #12 (July 2014) Learning of John's existence makes the mainstream universe's Dick Grayson envy the life his counterpart leads with his wife and he becomes more bitter towards Bruce, who indirectly caused the disintegration of his relationship with Barbara. * Warren McGinnis (Justice Lords) - Suffering former husband of Mary McGinnis and father of T. McGinnis.Batman Beyond Universe #12 (July 2014) * Zod - Genetically engineered son of Lord Superman and Lady Wonder Woman who joins the Justice League as the youngest member and under the tutelage of his father's benevolent counterpart, Superman.

View of the Hooghly River and Vidyasagar Setu from Prinsep Ghat Prinsep Ghat is one of the oldest recreational spots of Kolkata. People visit it in the evenings on weekends to go boating on the river, stroll along the bank and purchase food from stalls there. One stall selling ice-cream and fast food has been there for more than 40 years. A stretch of the beautified riverfront from Prinsep Ghat to Babughat (Baje Kadamtala Ghat) was inaugurated on 24 May 2012. It has illuminated and landscaped gardens and pathways, fountains and renovated ghats. One of the songs in the Bollywood film Parineeta was shot here on the ghats.

A typical route for legislation like this is to pass some version in both houses (so called companion billscompanion bill Senate Glossary), then refer the two bills to a conference committee, which would produce a single bill likely to pass both houses. These bills were motivated by concerns of copyright holders that their copyright protection in being undermined by the illegal dissemination of copyrighted information via the Internet. Opponents of the proposed legislation say that the proposed remedies are far worse than the problem they are intended to solve.  Economic impact of SOPA / PIPA  Negative impact on web hosting services Journalist Rebecca MacKinnon argued that making companies liable for users' actions could have a chilling effect on user-generated sites like YouTube. \\"The intention is not the same as China‚Äôs Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar\\". The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has warned that Etsy, Flickr and Vimeo all seem likely to shut down if the bill becomes law. According to critics, the bill would ban linking to sites deemed offending, even in search results and on services such as Twitter. Many cloud computing and Web hosting services may leave the US to avoid lawsuits. The Motion Picture Association of America claimed the act's effect on business would be slight, noting that at least 16 countries block websites, and the internet still functions in those countries. Denmark, Finland and Italy blocked The Pirate Bay after courts ruled in favor of music and film industry litigation, and a coalition of film and record companies has threatened to sue British Telecom if it does not follow suit. General threat to web-related businesses A news analysis in the information technology magazine eWeek stated, \\"The language of SOPA is so broad, the rules so unconnected to the reality of Internet technology and the penalties so disconnected from the alleged crimes that this bill could effectively kill e-commerce or even normal Internet use. The bill also has grave implications for existing U.S., foreign and international laws and is sure to spend decades in court challenges.\\" It was similarly claimed that, \\"any US consumer who uses a website overseas immediately gives the US jurisdiction the power to potentially take action against it.\\" On October 28, 2011, the EFF called the bill a \\"massive piece of job-killing Internet regulation,\\" and said, \\"This bill cannot be fixed; it must be killed.\\" Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, stated that \\"The bill attempts a radical restructuring of the laws governing the Internet,\\" and that \\"It would undo the legal safe harbors that have allowed a world-leading Internet industry to flourish over the last decade. It would expose legitimate American businesses and innovators to broad and open- ended liability. The result will be more lawsuits, decreased venture capital investment, and fewer new jobs.\\" A similar claim was made by CrowdFlower. Strategy& (Formerly Booz & Company) on November 16 released a study, funded by Google, finding that almost all of the 200 venture capitalists and angel investors interviewed would stop funding digital media intermediaries if the House bill becomes law. More than 80 percent said they would rather invest in a risky, weak economy with the current laws than a strong economy with the proposed law in effect. If legal ambiguities were removed and good faith provisions in place, investing would increase by nearly 115 percent.  Civil liberties issues with SOPA / PIPA  There were concerns that the bills were too vague and could be used for prior censorship. If WikiLeaks were accused of distributing copyrighted content, U.S. search engines could be served a court order to block search results pointing to WikiLeaks. Requiring search engines to remove links to an entire website altogether due to an infringing page would raise free speech concerns regarding lawful content hosted elsewhere on the site. proxy servers, such as those used during the Arab Spring, can also be used to thwart copyright enforcement and therefore may be made illegal by the act. The bills could allegedly be used to block any web site with a page that was identified in the U.K. or France as containing hate speech or violations of celebrities' privacy. The Center for Democracy and Technology warned, \\"If SOPA and PIPA are enacted, the US government must be prepared for other governments to follow suit, in service to whatever social policies they believe are important‚Äîwhether restricting hate speech, insults to public officials, or political dissent.\\" From the other side, the AFL-CIO's Paul Almeida stated that free speech was not a relevant consideration, because \\"The First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.\\" Floyd Abrams said ‚ÄúThe Protect IP Act neither compels nor prohibits free speech or communication‚Ä¶ the bill sets a high bar in defining when a website or domain is eligible for potential actions by the Attorney General‚Ä¶‚Äù.Letter from Floyd Abrams, to Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and Senator Hatch, (May 23, 2011), Letter of Support (accessed June 23, 2011) Google chairman Eric Schmidt has stated that the measures called for in the PROTECT IP Act are overly simple solutions to a complex problem, and that the precedent set by pruning DNS entries is bad from the viewpoint of free speech and would be a step toward less permissive Internet environments, such as China's. A group of Law professors said that the PROTECT IP and Stop Online Piracy bills could have the opposite of the intended impact, by driving users to unregulated, alternative DNS systems, and it could hinder the government from conducting legitimate Internet regulation. They question the constitutionality of both bills, believing they could have potentially disastrous technical consequences and would make US internet law more like the laws of repressive regimes. Both bills provide \\"nothing more than ex parte proceedings‚Äîproceedings at which only one side (the prosecutor or even a private plaintiff) need present evidence and the operator of the allegedly infringing site need not be present nor even made aware that the action was pending against his or her 'property.' This not only violates basic principles of due process by depriving persons of property without a fair hearing and a reasonable opportunity to be heard, it also constitutes an unconstitutional abridgement of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.\\"  Technical issues regarding SOPA / PIPA  The DNS filtering provisions in the bill \\"raise serious technical and security concerns\\" and would \\"break the Internet\\", according to whitepaperPROTECT IP Technical Whitepaper; May 12, 2011 by five Internet engineers. Other engineers and proponents of the act have called those concerns groundless and without merit.Debunking DNS Filtering Concerns; High Tech Forum; June 24, 2011Engineers: Protect IP Act would break DNS; PC World - Australia; July 15, 2011Stopping the Pirates Who Roam the Web; The New York Times; June 17, 2011 One particular concern expressed by network experts was that hackers would offer workarounds to private users to allow access to government-seized sites, but these workarounds might also jeopardize security by redirecting unsuspecting users to scam websites. Supporters of the bill argued that widespread circumvention of the filtering would be unlikely. The DNS provisions were compared to car door locks, noting that while they aren't foolproof against thieves, we should still use them.Internet Bill Could Help Hackers, Experts Warn ; NationalJournal; July 14, 2011 A browser plugin called MAFIAAFire Redirector already exists that redirects visitors to an alternative domain when a site's primary domain has been seized.

History The temple was founded, in 1849, by members of the Cantonese population of San Francisco. In 1854, the temple was renamed Kong Chow Clan Association, to stress the social activities planned by the temple. The Association provided social welfare and religious needs for the community. Like many buildings in the area, it was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and the community worked together to rebuild it at its original location, 520 Pine, near St. Mary's Square. The Kong Chow Family Association and Temple was designed by architect Gilbert Leong. Bess Truman's visit Bess Truman visited the temple in 1948, where she prayed for positive results for her husband, Harry S. Truman's presidential run. While there, she also asked for a prediction about the results, due to the public's prediction that he would lose. While there, she held a container of Kau cim sticks, and shook them until one of the sticks fell to the ground. This stick was then exchanged for a piece of paper, which told a story, offering insight to her question. The prediction was favorable, and Truman would go on to win the presidential election. The prediction slip that was given to her is displayed in the temple.  Protests  In 1968 and 1969, while in her nineties, Charlotte Ah Tye Chang led protests against plans to demolish the old Kong Chow Temple. Her niece, artist Nanying Stella Wong, joined her efforts. Chang did not live to see the old temple demolished, or the new Kong Chow Temple erected at another location in 1977. Today Sign detail In 1977, the temple moved to its current building on Stockton Street in Chinatown, known as the Kong Chow Building. The association works closely with the elderly population, offers scholarships and other charitable projects for the neighborhood. They also organize prayer sessions, and participates in the Qing Ming Festival. Inside of the temple is a sculpture of Guan Di, which serves as the main altar.

Efforts are also made to make the learning environment as stress-free as possible. In the natural approach, language output is not forced, but allowed to emerge spontaneously after students have attended to large amounts of comprehensible language input. The natural approach has become closely associated with Krashen's monitor model, and it is often seen as an application of the theory to language teaching. Despite this perception, there are some differences, particularly Terrell's view that some degree of conscious grammar study can be beneficial. The syllabus focuses on activities which Terrell sees as promoting subconscious language acquisition. He divides these activities into four main areas: content activities, such as learning a new subject in the target language; activities which focus on personalizing language, such as students sharing their favorite music; games; and problem-solving activities.  Background  The natural approach was originally created in 1977 by Terrell, a Spanish teacher in California, who wished to develop a style of teaching based on the findings of naturalistic studies of second-language acquisition. After the original formulation, Terrell worked with Krashen to further develop the theoretical aspects of the method. Terrell and Krashen published the results of their collaboration in the 1983 book The Natural Approach. The natural approach was strikingly different from the mainstream approach in the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s, the audio-lingual method. While the audio-lingual method prized drilling and error correction, these things disappeared almost entirely from the natural approach. Terrell and Krashen themselves characterized the natural approach as a \\"traditional\\" method and contrasted it with grammar-based approaches, which they characterized as new inventions that had \\"misled\\" teachers. The natural approach shares many features with the direct method (itself also known as the \\"natural method\\"), which was formulated around 1900 and was also a reaction to grammar- translation. Both the natural approach and the direct method are based on the idea of enabling naturalistic language acquisition in the language classroom; they differ in that the natural approach puts less emphasis on practice and more on exposure to language input and on reducing learners' anxiety.  Outline  The aim of the natural approach is to develop communicative skills, and it is primarily intended to be used with beginning learners. It is presented as a set of principles that can apply to a wide range of learners and teaching situations, and concrete objectives depend on the specific context in which it is used. Terrell outlines three basic principles of the approach: * \\"Focus of instruction is on communication rather than its form.\\"Terrell, cited in * \\"Speech production comes slowly and is _never_ forced.\\" * \\"Early speech goes through natural stages (yes or no response, one- word answers, lists of words, short phrases, complete sentences.)\\" These principles result in classrooms where the teacher emphasizes interesting, comprehensible input and low-anxiety situations. Lessons in the natural approach focus on understanding messages in the foreign language, and place little or no importance on error correction, drilling or on conscious learning of grammar rules. They also emphasize learning of a wide vocabulary base over learning new grammatical structures. In addition, teachers using the natural approach aim to create situations in the classroom that are intrinsically motivating for students. Terrell sees learners going through three stages in their acquisition of speech: comprehension, early speech, and speech emergence. In the comprehension stage Terrell focuses on students' vocabulary knowledge. His aim is to make the vocabulary stick in students' long term memory, a process which he calls binding. Terrell sees some techniques as more binding than others; for example, the use of gestures or actions, such as in total physical response, is seen to be more binding than the use of translation. According to Terrell, students' speech will only emerge after enough language has been bound through communicative input. When this occurs, the learners enter the early speech stage. In this stage, students answer simple questions, use single words and set phrases, and fill in simple charts in the foreign language. In the speech emergence stage, students take part in activities requiring more advanced language, such as role-plays and problem- solving activities.  Theory  Although Terrell originally created the natural approach without relying on a particular theoretical model, his subsequent collaboration with Krashen has meant that the method is often seen as an application to language teaching of Krashen's monitor model. Krashen outlined five hypotheses in his model: # The acquisition-learning hypothesis. This states that there is a strict separation between conscious learning of language and subconscious acquisition of language, and that only acquisition can lead to fluent language use. # The monitor hypothesis. This states that language knowledge that is consciously learned can only be used to monitor output, not to generate new language. Monitoring output requires learners to be focused on the rule and to have time to apply it. # The input hypothesis. This states that language is acquired by exposure to comprehensible input at a level a little higher than that the learner can already understand. Krashen names this kind of input \\"i+1\\". # The natural order hypothesis. This states that learners acquire the grammatical features of a language in a fixed order, and that this is not affected by instruction. # The affective filter hypothesis. This states that learners must be relaxed and open to learning in order for language to be acquired. Learners who are nervous or distressed may not learn features in the input that more relaxed learners would pick up with little effort. Despite its basis in Krashen's theory, the natural approach does not adhere to the theory strictly. In particular, Terrell perceives a greater role for the conscious learning of grammar than Krashen. Krashen's monitor hypothesis contends that conscious learning has no effect on learners' ability to generate new language, whereas Terrell believes that some conscious learning of grammar rules can be beneficial.  Syllabus  Terrell outlines four categories of classroom activities that can facilitate language acquisition (as opposed to language learning): * \\"Content (culture, subject matter, new information, reading, e.g. teacher tells interesting anecdote involving contrast between target and native culture.)\\" * \\"Affective- humanistic (students' own ideas, opinions, experiences, e.g. students are asked to share personal preferences as to music, places to live, clothes, hair styles, etc.)\\" * \\"Games [focus on using language to participate in the game, e.g. 20 questions: I, the teacher, am thinking of an object in this room. You, students, have twenty questions to guess the object. Typical questions: is it clothing? (yes) is it for a man or a woman? (woman) is it a skirt? (yes) is it brown? (yes) is it Ellen's skirt? (yes)]\\" * \\"Problem solving (focus on using language to locate information, use information, etc., e.g. looking at this listing of films in the newspaper, and considering the different tastes and schedule needs in the group, which film would be appropriate for all of us to attend, and when?)\\"  Reception  The natural approach enjoyed much popularity with language teachers, particularly with Spanish teachers in the United States. Markee (1997) puts forward four reasons for the success of the method. First, he says that the method was simple to understand, despite the complex nature of the research involved. Second, it was also compatible with the knowledge about second-language acquisition at the time. Third, Krashen stressed that teachers should be free to try the method, and that it could go alongside their existing classroom practices. Finally, Krashen demonstrated the method to many teachers' groups, so that they could see how it would work in practice.

A rotating mass, or rotor, is said to be out of balance when its center of mass (inertia axis) is out of alignment with the center of rotation (geometric axis). Unbalance causes a moment which gives the rotor a wobbling movement characteristic of vibration of rotating structures.  Causes of unbalance  ; Distortion from stress: Routine manufacturing processes can cause stress on metal components. Without stress relief, the rotor will distort itself to adjust. ; Thermal distortion: Thermal distortion often occurs with parts exposed to increased temperatures. Metals are able to expand when in contact with heat, so exposure to warmer temperatures can cause either the entire piece of machinery to expand, or just certain parts, causing distortion. ; Buildups and deposits: Rotating parts involved in material handling almost always accumulate buildup. Moreover, when exposed to oil, these parts can be very easily distorted. Without adhering to a maintenance routine or implementing an inspection process, oil can seep into the parts, causing unbalance. Effects of unbalance * Vibration * Noise * Decreased life of bearings * Unsafe work conditions * Reduced machine life * Increased maintenance Units used to express unbalance * In terms of the mass eccentricity e: ¬µm, mm, cm, ...; ¬µin, mil, in, ... * In terms of mass m at a given radius: ¬µg, mg, g, kg, ...; moz, oz, ... * In terms of mass √ó radius moment (mR): mg-mm, g-mm, mg-cm, g-cm, kg-mm, ...; oz-in, g-in, ... Types of balance Static balance A static balance (sometimes called a force balance) occurs when the inertial axis of a rotating mass is displaced from and parallel to the axis of rotation. Static unbalances can occur more frequently in disk-shaped rotors because the thin geometric profile of the disk allows for an uneven distribution of mass with an inertial axis that is nearly parallel to the axis of rotation. Only one plane receives balance correction. : U = m \\\\times r where U = balance, m = mass, r = distance between unbalance and the centre of the object Couple balance A couple balance occurs when a rotating mass has two equal unbalance forces that are situated 180¬∞ opposite each other. A system that is statically balanced may still have a couple unbalance. Couple unbalance occurs frequently in elongated cylindrical rotors. : U = m \\\\times r \\\\times d where d = distance between the two unbalance forces along the rotation axis. Dynamic balance In rotation an unbalance when the mass/inertia axis does not intersect with shaft axis then it is called dynamic balance. Combination of static and couple balance is dynamic unbalance. It occurs in virtually all rotors and is the most common kind of unbalance. It can be fixed by correcting the weight on at least two planes. How to correct or compensate balance * Mass addition. * Mass removal. * Mass shifting. * Mass centering. The measurement of existing vibration and calculation of the change of mass required is typically carried out using some form of balancing machine. Grades ISO 21940 classifies vibration in terms of G codes. Unfortunately, it is the theoretical value assuming the rotor was spinning in free space so it does not relate to actual operating conditions. Rotors of the same type having permissible residual specific unbalance value eper, varies inversely with the speed of the rotor. : eper √ó œâ = Constant, where œâ = angular velocity (radians per second) eper = permissible residual specific unbalance This constant is quality grade G. Balance Grades are used to specify the allowable residual imbalance for rotating machinery. The ISO 1940 standard defines balance grades for different classes of machinery. A rotor balanced to G2.5 will vibrate at 2.5 mm/s at operating speed if rotating in a suspended state with no external influences. : Uper = (9.54 √ó G number √ó mass)/rpm Where Uper = balance tolerance (or) residual imbalance Important formulas : F = U \\\\omega^2 : U = mass(unbalance) r : e = \\\\frac{U}{m(rotor)} Where F = force due to unbalance, U = unbalance. œâ = angular frequency. e = specific unbalance. m = mass. r = distance between unbalance and the axis of rotation of the object.

It is commonly found as a motorcycle's right handlebar grip to control the throttle, but is sometimes found elsewhere, such as on a bicycle as a gearshift, and in helicopters. History The Roper steam velocipede of 1867-69. Drawings from 1884 showed a twist grip belt tensioner, complex steering linkage and used a belt drive. The working model had a simple handlebar and used a pinion gear drive. Indian The first use of the twist grip throttle control was on the Roper steam velocipede of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point in favor of the Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel in the manner of a clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes. Glenn Curtiss, unlikely to have been aware of the prior uses of the twist grip, used it in his 1904 motorcycle land-speed record machine, and is sometimes credited as the inventor of the device. Indian claimed in their advertisements, also for their 1904 models, to have invented the twist grip. Whether Curtiss, Gottlieb Daimler, or Roper, were the true inventors, the 1904 Indian would be the earliest use of the device on a production motorcycle. Motorcycle throttles are spring-loaded to cut the engine power back to idling when the twistgrip is released. Formerly some motorcycle throttle twistgrips had a screw that could be screwed in to make the twistgrip stay still when released (e.g. for the rider to signal right turn), but a ruling from Brussels forbad that on safety grounds.

Punjabi music is very popular in the Sri Ganganagar. The impact of the Saraiki dialect can be observed in Arora, Raisikhs and Saraiki Muslim communities. Now this dialect, Saraiki is losing ground in the northern part of the district. Bagri is spoken only in Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts and in some tehsils of neighbouring Punjab and Haryana. A number of writers of the district have made contributions to Rajasthani literature, through Bagri. Culture Rural kutcha homes with folk art can be seen in some remote villages, but this art is losing ground. Punjabi and Bagri cultures dominate the district. The embroidered Odhni (mostly red in colour) is a symbol of Bagri women. A long shirt and ghaghro (long frock type clothes) and borlo (a head ornament) is the traditional dress of Bagri women. Punjabi women wear a suit and salwar with chunni (cloth on head). This attire has also become popular with women of other communities. Some women of the Hindu and Muslim Seraiki people still wear ghaggra (long frock). The Purdah (or veil) is mainly in vogue among Bagri women. Men mainly wear a pant-shirt, kurta-payjama and dhoti (Punjabis call it the chadara-kurta).¬ß Traditional Sikh and Rajasthani devotional music is popular.

However, there's also an uninvited houseguest in Bharat's household; Amita, a young, beautiful girl who works at a call center and often likes to hitch a ride with Bharat on his scooter, when he is not busy dropping his wife to her school. Contrary to his wife's wishes, Bharat's sole ambition in life is to graduate from his role as 'Hanuman' to 'Lord Ram' someday. However, that puts him at loggerheads with Sattu Tripathi, the younger brother of the local MLA and a bad actor playing 'Lord Ram', who is perpetually annoyed at being upstaged by 'Hanuman'. His older brother, MLA Manku also has his share of problems with Bharat, who refuses to let out an extra room to him for his re-election campaign. Bharat's happy little haven is disturbed rudely one day when the local 'havaldaar' Kushwaah comes knocking at his door, claiming to have caught a thief, Chunnu Farishta, who purportedly stole a fan from his house, a theft that Bharat has no idea about, though the local 'panwala', Bachhu Gulukand, is a sworn witness. Virtually ordered to come to court, Bharat finds himself suddenly dealing with made-up testimonies, lazy judges, and crooked characters of all sorts, trapped in the system that plagues the country today.

It is one of the best known butterflies in South America. Its genome is nearly identical to D. plexippus, but the two are incompatible, and therefore considered separate species.Hay-Roe, M.M., Lamas, G. & Nation, J.L. (2007). Pre- and postzygotic isolation and Haldane rule effects in reciprocal crosses of Danaus erippus and Danaus plexippus (Lepidoptera: Danainae), supported by differentiation of cuticular hydrocarbons, establish their status as separate species.

Danaus erippus is included with other Nymphalidae, the largest family of butterflies with about 6000 species distributed throughout most of the world. It has a reduced pair of forelegs, is brightly coloured, and is included with popular species such as the emperors, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. Its wingspan reaches about , with an easily recognizable orange and black pattern. Until 2007, this butterfly was treated as a subspecies of Danaus plexippus. These species are very similar, but D. erippus usually has an orange trailing edge of the forewings, while in D. plexippus it is black. The lineages of the two species are thought to have separated about 2 million years ago. The colour of the wings in males of the southern monarch is paler than in the females. Migration Though, not as well known as the eastern North American monarch migratory phenomenon, it has been observed to move in a consistent spring/autumn manner by flying south in the autumn towards colder latitudes for the winter.Hayward, K.J.

In 1951, at 24, Ramdeen was introduced to the Trinbagonian national audience by Landy de Montbrun, a leading local comic at the time. He told a joke, slightly nervous that he was crossing the boundary of taste. But the crowd was elated. \\"They were very happy to see a (dark-skinned) fella,\\" Agitation later remarked. From there, Agitation became a regular on Radio Trinidad, particularly the Horace James Comedy Hour, Sunday Serenade (hosted by Sam Ghany) and the Aunty Kay Children's Show. The latter was sponsored by Bermudez Biscuit Company Limited for decades. He performed in many venues in Trinidad and Tobago as the headline performer, often to sold-out shows. Throughout his life he was an avid hunter, as his home was in the rural, still-forested area of Cumuto, with a large population of agouti and brocket deer. He farmed oranges, mandarins, tangelos, portugals (clementines) and grapefruit on his 10-acre estate. He was the first candidate to run on a United National Congress (UNC) ticket: he contested and won a 1989 by-election in the Sangre Grande Regional Corporation for the Guaico-Cumuto district, thus becoming the first comedian in the Commonwealth of Nations to win an election. Agi, as he was known in Trinbago, retired, lived on his public service pension, but still performed occasionally until his death in 2018. In 2003, Ramdeen \\"John Agitation\\" Ramjattan was awarded the Hummingbird Medal (Silver) by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, for his more than five-decade-long work to preserve Trinbagonian and Caribbean folklore via comedic storytelling.

Football career Thompson was born in Maltby, South Yorkshire, the son of George Thompson, the York City (and later Southampton) goalkeeper. His brother, Des, also played as a goalkeeper, for York City, Burnley and Sheffield United. Thompson's professional career started when he signed for Chesterfield in June 1947. He spent three years at Saltergate without making a first-team appearance. In June 1950, he joined Scunthorpe & Lindsey United for their first season in the Third Division North of the Football League, making his debut on the opening day of the season on 11 August 1950 against Shrewsbury Town, also newly elected to the Football league. Thompson kept a clean sheet as the match finished 0‚Äì0. Over the next two seasons, he became a first team fixture, making 92 league appearances for Scunthorpe. In October 1952, Thompson joined Preston North End, replacing Malcolm Newlands, and made his debut in a 5‚Äì2 victory at Portsmouth on 25 October. He made 30 appearances during the 1952‚Äì53 season, keeping ten clean sheets, as Preston finished runners-up to Arsenal for the First Division title. On 14 February 1953, Preston North End were playing Sheffield Wednesday at Deepdale; Derek Dooley was chasing a long pass from Albert Quixall when he collided with Thompson just as he made contact with the ball, breaking the centre-forward's leg in two places. Dooley never recovered from his injuries with gangrene setting into his leg, and as a result had to have his right leg amputated just above the knee, thus ending his playing career. In the 1953‚Äì54 season, Thompson made 39 league appearances and was part of the Preston team which reached the final of the FA Cup. In the match against West Bromwich Albion, on 1 May 1954, led 2‚Äì1 thanks to goals from Angus Morrison and Charlie Wayman. A penalty conceded by Tommy Docherty and a late goal from Frank Griffin who slipped the ball under Thompson turned the game which ended 3‚Äì2. Thompson played regularly over the next two seasons before losing his place to the younger Fred Else. Thompson's last Preston match came on 24 March 1956 in a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Portsmouth. In all he made 155 appearances for Preston in four years. During his time at the Deepdale club, Thompson also won England 'B' honours; his international appearance came on 22 May 1954 when he was a half-time substitute for Ray King in a 2‚Äì0 defeat by their Swiss equivalents. Thompson joined Manchester City in June 1956 as understudy to Bert Trautmann, making only two first-team appearances in his year at Maine Road. In the summer of 1957, Thompson joined Carlisle United where he stayed for five seasons making 206 appearances before retiring in 1962, dropping down to non-league football with Morecambe.

Its closure came with the merging with the former Toa Payoh Hospital and was renamed as the Changi General Hospital, which relocated new operations to nearby Simei, not far from Changi. It began winding down activities in February 1997 (completely abandoned in December that year) and remains abandoned to this day but due to the original hospital buildings being out of bounds to the public, Universal Studios Singapore (USS) has built a small replica of the ex-Changi Hospital in its theme-park to raise awareness of the famous haunted building, which becomes popular amongst visitors especially during the Halloween period. Since its abandonment, many horror stories and paranormal tales have emerged from the place, ranging from tales of an alleged nurse roaming the compound to poltergeists haunting the old hospital. However, there is almost no substantial proof to back these up, aside from several photos or videos taken outside or within the abandoned hospital. History What is now the abandoned Changi Hospital was first built by the British government in 1935 to complement other military installations like armouries and barracks in Changi, which was then an area with a large British military base that was intended to defend the eastern end (coastal areas) of the Johor Strait. The currently-empty hospital included two main military buildings constructed by the British colonial government, namely Block 24 and Block 37, both on a prominent hill (almost rarely referred to as Barrack Hill (pre-WWII) or FEAF (Far East Air Force) Hill (postwar)) overlooking the eastern Johor Straits and the nearby Pulau Ubin about a kilometre across the sea. Both blocks were a part of Kitchener Barracks, housing the British Army's Royal Engineers, and it is believed that Block 37 was commissioned and used as a small medical facility serving the barracks there. It is also speculated that not only did it serve the engineers barracked there, but artillery soldiers of the Royal Artillery in Roberts Barracks (currently Fairy Point Hotel) and the Gordon Highlanders in Selarang Camp (now the Singapore Army's 9th Division HQ Base), were also provided for at Block 37. These three British military units were based nearby from the hospital in the Changi area. During the period of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, the compound of Kitchener Barracks was operated for use as a military hospital (mainly for service to wounded Japanese military personnel and some Allied prisoners-of-war (POWs)) and was also a component of a major prison-area in Changi which was handled by the notorious Kempeitai (the Japanese military police, which also played the role of that of a secret police). Even so, much of the Changi area where Allied and some civilian POWs were held were generally regarded as almost-autonomous in its administration, with prisoners allowed to roam around much of the area, albeit under constant Japanese supervision. In Blocks 24 and 37 of Kitchener Barracks, it is alleged that the Kempeitai also used it as a torture centre (this unfounded rumour was based on the unconfirmed claim that a particular small room with high and narrow windows, in which thick chains hanging on the walls and what was supposedly the remnants of an old torture-device, with alleged bloodstains left on the old floor, served as the infamous torture-chamber in the hospital) aside from its original purpose as a medical centre. The prison's medical facilities at Kitchener Barracks were later deemed inadequate and was temporarily shifted to Roberts Barracks. The medical centre moved back to its original premises at Block 37 following the end of the Second World War in 1945. Two years later, the British Royal Air Force (RAF), based at the nearby RAF Changi airfield, set up RAF Hospital Changi in Blocks 24 and 37. In 1962, a new building was added to complement the two prewar-era blocks that made up the then-current hospital. Block 161, a large modern addition-structure, was constructed between Blocks 24 and 37 to join them together over FEAF Hill, which prior to that divided the two buildings, making access between them difficult. From 1947 until 1971, the RAF used the hospital to serve not only its service-personnel, but foreign troops from the Commonwealth, not least Australian and New Zealand troops, as well as even UN soldiers during the Korean War too (between 1950 and 1953). This arrangement continued until Singapore claimed full independence in August 1965. From that time on, the British commenced a gradual withdrawal of their military presence from Singapore, following their East of Suez policy, which called for the eventual British departure from Southeast Asia. The hospital was renamed as the ANZUK Hospital in 1971, following the large-scale exit of British troops based in Singapore before that year and served ANZUK (Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom (UK)) servicemen. The ANZUK unit was disbanded in 1975 and it was renamed the UK Military Hospital, even though British forces were almost no longer present in Singapore anymore (excluding only a very-small token force). In December of that same year, the British finally withdrew the last of their troops and the hospital was handed over to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and renamed as Singapore Armed Forces Hospital. The SAF Hospital catered to medical care of SAF personnel and their immediate families. Gradually, the hospital's services was also extended to members of the public, and rates were charged to the same as other government-run public hospitals elsewhere in Singapore. The SAF Hospital later merged with the nearby 36-bed Changi Chalet Hospital in 1976 and renamed as Changi Hospital after the former was handed over to the Ministry of Health. This arrangement lasted until 15 December in 1997, when Changi Hospital was shut down after merging with Toa Payoh Hospital to form Changi General Hospital, after which, the old hospital ceased operations and was left empty ever since, with the ownership of the old hospital being transferred to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) which originally had posted security-guards and their guard-dogs to protect the old hospital from trespassers (at this time, the compound was not fenced up yet and many trespassers, both locals and foreigners, often enter the abandoned premises to conduct activities such as ghost-hunting, vandalism (both graffiti vandalism and outright damaging of the property), consumption of drugs and even Satanic worshipping). In 2006, the SLA put up the entire site for commercial-based leasing. The tender put up was won by Bestway Properties, which proposed to build a luxurious spa-resort in the old hospital by the first half of 2008. The project fell through and was never commenced (partly due to financial difficulties during the recession at that period of time) and the site was returned to the SLA in 2010, which has since fenced up the entire compound and installed security-cameras and motion-sensors in multiple locations in and around the abandoned hospital to replace the security personnel needed to guard the area (even so, a few, mainly teens and the general youth, still attempt to sneak inside the hospital despite the risk of being arrested). Prosegur is the security company charged by SLA to protect Changi Hospital, which continues to remain abandoned to this day. Hauntings The vacated hospital compound was popular with film-makers after the Singapore Land Authority commenced a short-term rental programme of the abandoned and derelict buildings that was once Changi Hospital. Many popular MediaCorp television series such as Growing Up, The Crime Hunters, C.I.D. and Incredible Tales were partly filmed at the now-abandoned hospital, which by the 2000s was already badly damaged and entirely desecrated by hundreds of vandals, criminals, drug-users and possible Satanists. Around this time, Old Changi Hospital, as it is popularly known, was famously declared by many Singaporeans, young and old alike, to be one of the most haunted locations in the whole country. The buildings are said to be haunted by the souls of the victims of the Japanese Occupation, homeless ghosts and the spirits of those who died in the hospital. In 2017, a video of sightings of a nurse carrying a baby in the haunted hospital circulated around the Internet, sparking debate on its authenticity and the spookiness of the former hospital and the supposed paranormal activities inside. Until now, the authenticity of this video has not yet been proven. The once-abandoned and derelict buildings and its ghostly reputation were the basis for the 2010 mockumentary Haunted Changi, which, using found-footage, told of a small group of paranormal investigators going inside the hospital to learn of its horrifying past and ended with terrifying outcomes to each member. Some of the more prominent areas of the old hospital that was famous for hauntings include the old mortuary which has since been demolished, the tile-walled operating theatre and the old hospital's Accident- and-Emergency (A&E;) building (located below the hill from where the main hospital is located at has long been demolished already). There is also a widespread belief of the presence of supposed underground bunkers beneath Changi Hospital (from the days when it was a military base), although there is currently no available access to them and their alleged entry-points (rumoured to be 3) are also closed off. A picture had been taken at Changi Aloha Chalet near the hospital and allegedly showed what was seen as a ghost. According to the owners of the photo, their room was located right opposite Changi Hospital and the abandoned (and infamously-haunted) Aloha Changi Resort.

The brigade was formed on 13 December 2011 by amalgamating the 2nd Land Force Group and 3rd Land Force Group. Its establishment formed part of the 'Army 2015' package of reforms. Previous 1st Brigades in the New Zealand Army have included a brigade in the Middle East and France, 1916‚Äì19, a home defence formation active during the Second World War (part of the North Island home defence 1st Division), and a 1 Brigade / Integrated Expansion Force formed to direct three Territorial Force- formed battalions in the 1970s and 1980s. First World War The 1st Brigade came into being in Egypt in early 1916, when the New Zealand and Australian Division was re-organised in the wake of the Gallipoli Campaign, and the New Zealand Division was formed. Under the command of Brigadier General Harry Fulton, the brigade initially consisted of four infantry battalions, being the 1st Battalions of the Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington Regiments. In this configuration, the brigade was transferred to the Western Front in Europe, and fought through the Battle of the Somme before the New Zealand Division was restructured. This saw the brigade reconfigured, swapping its two South Island battalions (the 1st Canterbury and 1st Otago) with the two North Island battalions (2nd Auckland and 2nd Wellington) of the 2nd Brigade. This placed all the North Island battalions in the 1st Brigade while all the South Island formations were in the 2nd Brigade. Following this, the brigade fought in the Battle of Messines and the Third Battle of Ypres during 1917, before helping to turn back the German Spring Offensive in early 1918, and then taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive in the final months of the war. After the armistice, the brigade was committed briefly to post war occupation duties until the New Zealand Division disbanded in early 1919.  Second World War  The 1st Infantry Brigade was re-established prior to the Second World War as a Territorial Force formation manned by part-time reservists. At the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, it formed part of the field force for the Northern District. At this time it commanded the 1st Hauraki Regiment (headquartered at Paeroa), 1st North Auckland Regiment (Whangarei) and 1st Waikato Regiment (Hamilton). On 1 November 1941, the 1st Brigade became part of the newly formed Northern Division in the Northern Military District. The division's two brigades were the 1st and 12th Brigade Groups. Later the Northern Division became the 1st Division. The 12th Brigade Group was one of the new headquarters, and both these units continued to be manned by reservists. During early 1942, camps were constructed for the 1st Brigade Group in South Auckland and the 12th Brigade Group at Kaikohe. The 1st Brigade subsequently moved to a camp near Warkworth. After the threat of invasion passed, the 1st Brigade and the other home defence formations were reduced in size during 1943. By the end of the year the seven brigade (including 1st Brigade) and three divisional headquarters comprised a total of 44 personnel, with the soldiers assigned to the Territorial Force units they once commanded having been demobilised. All of these headquarters were disbanded on 1 April 1944. In 1950, Northern Military District directed four subordinate Area Headquarters, being Area 1 (HQ Auckland), Area 2 (HQ Tauranga), Area 3 (HQ Whangarei), and Area 4 (HQ Hamilton).  Combat Brigade Group 1963 In 1963, the Combat Brigade Group (1st Brigade) was established, based on the Northern Military District headquarters at Auckland. Headquarters Northern Military District was disestablished in 1970 and the headquarters became home to Field Force Command.

He moved to Providence, Rhode Island where he became an attorney and was suspected by the authorities of involvement in the Gaspee Affair. At the start of the American Revolutionary War he formed Hitchcock's Regiment of infantry in the Rhode Island Army of Observation. He was first appointed lieutenant colonel in command of the regiment when it marched to serve in the Siege of Boston in 1775. His regiment was renamed the 11th Continental Regiment during 1776. That year, he led his troops at Long Island, Harlem Heights, and White Plains. He was promoted to colonel in November 1776. His regiment was renamed the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment at the start of 1777. He led a small brigade of Rhode Island troops at Assunpink Creek and Princeton. At the latter action on 3 January 1777, George Washington publicly thanked him for his efforts. He died ten days later of tuberculosis at Morristown, New Jersey.  Early life  Not much is known of Daniel Hitchcock's early life. He was born on February 15, 1739 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was the youngest of 14 children from Lieutenant Ebenezer and Mary Hitchcock. In 1761, Hitchcock graduated from Yale University, and he went on to practice law in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hitchcock moved to Providence, Rhode Island in 1771. Hitchcock was thought by authorities to be affiliated with the Gasp√©e Affair, a sinking of a British ship and a lead up to the American Revolutionary War. Hitchcock, along with other lawyers, were forced to testify in front of the Rhode Island Court. Hitchcock, however, denied any involvement in the Affair.  American Revolution  Engraving depicting the British evacuation of Boston during the Siege of Boston In June 1775, Hitchcock authorized the Providence County Regiment, which was organized as eight companies of volunteers from Providence County of the colony of Rhode Island. The Regiment's first battle was the Siege of Boston, the opening battle of the American Revolutionary War. At the start of 1776, the Regiment was renamed to the 11th Continental Regiment. The colonists were victorious on May 17, 1776, and the British were removed from the town of Boston, Massachusetts. Hitchcock's next battle was the Battle of Long Island. The British landed in Long Island on August 22 ready to attack American troops. Hitchcock's Regiment had 368 men. He and six other Regiments were sent to Long Island on August 25, when it was clear that was the British target. The battle took place two days later, and the British won in a decisive victory. This battle was the first major battle in the American Revolutionary War following the United States Declaration of Independence, the largest battle of the entire conflict, and the first battle in which an army of the United States engaged, having declared itself a nation only the month before. On September 15, 1776, the British moved part of their troops to Kip's Bay, Manhattan. The following day, the Battle of Harlem Heights happened. The British were losing, and started to retreat. George Washington sent various troops, including Hitchcock's Regiment, to pursue them. By the time the units got there, the British brought in more reinforcements. The British troops ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat a second time. The Americans kept up a close pursuit until it was heard that British reserves were coming, and Washington, fearing a British trap, ordered a withdrawal, and the Americans won the battle. Battle of Trenton, by H. Charles McBarron, Jr., 1975 Hitchcock's next battle was the Battle of White Plains. Following the retreat of George Washington's Continental Army northward from New York City, British General William Howe landed troops in Westchester County, intending to cut off Washington's escape route. Alerted to this move, Washington retreated farther, establishing a position in the village of White Plains but failed to establish firm control over local high ground. Howe's troops drove Washington's troops from a hill near the village; following this loss, Washington ordered the Americans to retreat farther north. Later British movements chased Washington across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. Washington then crossed the Delaware and surprised a brigade of Hessian troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton. Hitchcock led a Brigade of an estimated 822 men. He, along with several other units, stayed away from the Battle and were used at backups in case Washington needed them. The Americans won in a decisive victory, which proved to be great for American moral throughout the colonies. The American troops were expecting a counter-attack from the British, so the Army established a defensive position south of the Assunpink Creek. On December 31, Washington learned that an army of 8,000 men under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton. The Battle of the Assunpink Creek, which Hitchcock's Regiment fought in, took place on January 2, 1777. Cornwallis' advance was significantly slowed due to defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand, and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times, and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided to wait and finish the battle the next day. Washington, attacked during the night, and the Battle of Princeton happened on January 3, 1777. Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army clashed with two regiments under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood of the British Army. Mercer and his troops were overrun and Washington sent some militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help him. The militia, on seeing the flight of Mercer's men, also began to flee. Washington rode up with reinforcements and rallied the fleeing militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood's troops, driving them back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton. Hitchcock was infected with dysentery during the battle, however, he commanded the \\"New England Brigade\\", which helped the Americans win the battle. Washington personally thanked Hitchcock for his efforts during the War in front of the entire Continental Army. Hitchcock would die on January 13, 1777 at a camp in Morristown, and he was buried January 14.

Context and influence The sources used by Gonzalo de Berceo were various collections of tales about the miracles written in Latin He made use of the characteristic resources of the minstrels (see Mester de Juglar√≠a). It is important to note that Gonzalo de Berceo belonged to the Mester de Clerec√≠a. The book helped to promote Marian devotions among the people by making the subject easier to understand for the people of his time, but it contains many unorthodox elements that give Mary powers of resurrection or the ability to save sinners from Divine Judgement. http://www.bibliotecagonzalodeberceo.com/berceo/pamelabastante/berceoymariedefrance.htmSaugnieux, Jo√´l.

It is set in an idealized natural scene, which symbolizes the virtues and perfections of the Virgin. The introduction is followed by twenty-five miracles performed by the Virgin for her devotees. At the end of each story there is a moraleja (moral) or teaching to make the advantages of devotion to Mary apparent to the listener or reader. These miracles can be categorised into three different types: * Miracles in which Mary rewards or punishes men, e.g. La casulla de San Idelfonso. * Miracles in which the Virgin forgives and assures the salvation of her devotees, e.g. El sacrist√°n imp√∫dico, El Judezno, Milagro de Te√≥filo. * Miracles in which the characters suffer a spiritual crisis which Mary helps them to solve, e.g. La abadesa encinta.

Character and materials The form of the symphony, along with those of its predecessors, owes a great debt to the symphonies of Sibelius . A second influence came from Renaissance architecture, particularly the churches of Filippo Brunelleschi. Davies explains that his use of Fibonacci numbers to proportion the symphony was modelled directly on Brunelleschi's structures . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (second doubling alto flute, third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. Unlike the preceding two symphonies, the only percussion instruments employed in the Third are the timpani. Here they often assume a soloistic role (even more than in the Second Symphony) in order to emphasize the focal pitch classes . Analysis The symphony is in four movements: # Lento ‚Äì Adagio ‚Äì Andante ‚Äì Moderato ‚Äì Allegretto ‚Äì Allegro moderato ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Allegro alla breve # Scherzo I: Allegro # Scherzo II: Allegro vivace: scorrevole e bisbigliando # Lento ‚Äì Adagio flessibile Each of these movements is based on the same architectural outline, but expresses it with a different constructional technique. In addition, this same outline informs the construction of the symphony as a whole, and is also used as the basis of subdividing sections of each movement . The symphony begins with a movement approximating the traditional sonata-allegro form . It begins in slow tempo in the tonality of D, quoting in the flutes a plainsong addressed to the Archangel Michael, \\"Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in praelio\\", and the movement becomes progressively faster until the opening material and tonality returns and \\"the music is blown right away, as if it were on scurrying air-currents\\" . The pitches of the chant are first \\"sieved\\" by to retain only the first occurrence of pitch classes. This results in a seven- note sequence, which is expanded to an eight-note set by the arbitrary addition of D. This set is then arranged in an 8 x 8 transposition square (where the row is transposed successively to begin on each of its eight pitches), and this square is manipulated according to the 64-element Magic Square of Mercury . At the same time, durations are built according to Fibonacci numbers descending from 21 downwards, with each number representing a multiple of a breve unit . Within this process of acceleration the pitch material converges onto a centre of F which, together with B and A-flat, forms an alternative tonal centre to the tonic D throughout the symphony . The second and third movements are a pair of scherzos. The composer likens the second movement to the visual experience of contemplating a Brunelleschi church nave from a fixed central point. In addition, there was a ‚Äúphysical inspiration‚Äù, of nesting seabirds wheeling around a towering cliff face . The second of the pair of scherzos distorts the perspective of the first, as if the same nave were being seen from one side. In this movement, the composer consciously borrows a device from the \\"Burlesque\\" movement of Mahler's Ninth Symphony, \\"where the tumult stops and the composer lets in 'windows'\\", through which slow passages of the adagio finale are glimpsed . The form of the third movement affects the finale in three ways. First, the \\"windows\\" disrupt the musical continuity of the previous two movements, and thereby \\"reducing, but not totally avoiding, the likelihood of an archetypal formal design being used in the finale\\" . Second, the windows' tonality of C, the modal dominants G and F, and the diatonic dominant A (all established by the timpani), anticipate the finale. Thirdly, the windows sections, characterised by texture rather than by motif, recur twice in the finale (; ). The finale then returns to the material of the first movement, and develops it more amply . On the largest scale, the four movements of the symphony combine into a single, overarching ‚Äúmeta-sonata form‚Äù . All four movements, however, resist structural closure by denying the tonic's usual function of asserting its superiority at the end, and an important aspect of the formal unfolding of the entire work is the oscillation between sections having tonal focus on the one hand with others of a tonally ambiguous polyphony .

The album paired the music of The Notorious B.I.G. with the debut album of The xx and was named \\"the best mashup album of 2010\\"by The Guardian. He has released three albums and has performed with artists including Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, and Taking Back Sunday. Early life Born in Palo Alto, California, Kubal began DJing at age 15 while attending Crystal Springs Uplands School in a suburb outside San Francisco, California, both playing in the band Jubala and DJing parties. He began producing music when he moved to New York to attend Columbia University in 2004. While studying English literature and psychology there, he recorded and produced hip hop from his dorm room, and hosted a hip hop show on WBAR college radio. Later he took courses under Brad Garton and Terry Pender at the Computer Music Center with other Columbia musicians, including Reni Lane. Given 24-hour access to the 125th St. studio, he created his first sample- based tracks in 2008 in Digital Performer and later in Logic Pro. The notorious xx Upon graduating in 2008, Kubal moved back to San Francisco, where he was employed at Google on the Calendar team and played a handful of local shows before beginning work on the notorious xx in early 2010. He created the record over a period of three weeks in January 2010 while he was traveling, creating it on flights and airports while in Williamstown, Aspen, New Orleans, Zurich, London, Denver, Chicago and finally in his San Francisco apartment. Following its release on March 25, 2010, the album attracted the attention of New York Magazine, Prefix Magazine, Sputnik, and The Guardian. Within ten days of the album's release, several of the tracks were voted to the top of The Hype Machine's popular chart, and it received one million downloads. On April 6, 2010 he received a takedown request from Warner Music Group and was forced to remove official download links from his site. This is real life (mixtape) Shortly after the takedown, he began work on material for a live set and a mixtape, eventually releasing this is real life on August 31, 2010. He asked fans to call and leave him voicemails at a Google Voice number (347-WTWHT-01) to be sampled on the record, and in two weeks received messages from dozens of countries that he cut up to create the intro and interludes on the mixtape. Additionally, he created the mixtape as a pay what you want project on Bandcamp, with all profits going to Dave Eggers' youth writing non-profit, 826 Valencia. As of September 2011, he had raised $8500 for the organization. The mixtape paired a number of hip hop artists with indie rock tracks in an A vs. B style, and included vocals from 50 Cent, DMX, Eminem, Jagged Edge, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz, Lupe Fiasco, Mase, Nas, Nelly, Obie Trice, P Diddy, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, and The-Dream paired with instrumentals from Crystal Castles, DFA, Justice, LCD Soundsystem, Madonna, MGMT, MIA, Miike Snow, OneRepublic, Phoenix, Placebo, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Say Hi, Sleigh Bells, Something Corporate, The Big Pink, The Notwist, and The Swell Season. To accompany the mixtape's release, he headlined a sold-out show with fellow Google employee Hoodie Allen at Kimo's in San Francisco, marking the first time he incorporated drummer Will Paulus into the live show. 2010-11 touring In the week following the release of this is real life, Kubal left Google to attend graduate school at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He finished the year by performing in Toronto for Fashion Week and at a club in Kigali, Rwanda, and sold out another San Francisco warehouse show. In 2011 he played in Portland at Lewis & Clark College's Sunburn Music Festival with Astronautalis and Andrew Jackson Jihad, headlined Public Assembly in Brooklyn and bed supperclub in Bangkok, Thailand, and played all three days of The Bamboozle festival at Giants Stadium with Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, and Taking Back Sunday.

Pakistan constitutionally is a democratic parliamentary republic with its political system based on an elected form of governance. Since the establishment of the current system in 2003, Pakistan is one of the youngest democracies in the world. The democratic elections held in 2008 were the first to conclude a complete 5-year term in the nations' political history. Currently Pakistan is the 4th largest democracy and the largest Majoritarian democracy. It is also the largest non-liberal democracy in the world. History  It was one of the earliest and largest ancient human civilisations alongside Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, Anatolia and ancient China, known for its highly developed, sophisticated and urbanised culture and much later also old Greece which had some form of democratic rule. Historians and social scientists studying the civilisation's social structure observe that the Indus Valley had an organised planning system, including standard architecture, civic controls, consistent grid layouts and uniformed sanitary facilities. This well-disciplined lifestyle and a common Rule of Law extending throughout a large area leads some historians to believe and suggest the Indus Valley civilisation in Pakistan as possibly the earliest cradle and model of democracy; one which was based on a \\"popular rule by the people\\" based on the conceptions of Welfare State and Rule of law (and hence the presence of some form of Democracy) which even predated old Greece.The Indus Valley civilization ‚Äì cradle of democracy?Did Democracy Begin in the Indus Valley? In the wake of intensifying political instability, the civilian bureaucracy and military assumed governing power in 1958. Since its independence, Pakistan's naked system has fluctuated between civilian and military governments at various times throughout its political history, mainly due to political instability, civil-military conflicts, political corruption, and the periodic coup d'√©tats by the military establishment against weak civilian governments, resulting in the enforcement of martial law across the country (occurring in 1958, 1977 and 1999, and led by chief martial law administrator-generals Ayub Khan, Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf respectively). Democracy in Pakistan, however imperfect, has been allowed to function to varying degrees. Until 2013, Pakistan did not experience even one democratic transfer of power from one democratically elected government that had completed its tenure to another. All of its previous democratic transitions have been aborted by military coup .Aqil Shah, The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan (Harvard University Press, 2014), p. 1.

A professional school, North Pacific had pharmacy, dental, and optometry programs. The dental program was purchased by the state of Oregon and merged into the University of Oregon School of Medicine and now exists as the Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry. The optometry school was merged into Pacific University and still exists as the Pacific University College of Optometry. History The foundations of the school started in the 1890s in Tacoma, Washington, when physicians in that city sought to compete with Seattle by opening a dental school before the University of Washington could establish their own school. Meanwhile, in Portland, Dr. Herbert C. Miller had been asked by the University of Oregon to lead a group to investigate adding a dental school to the School of Medicine in Portland. While Miller's group decided it was premature to start a school in Portland, the Tacoma group founded the Tacoma College of Dental Surgery in 1893. Soon after, the Tacoma school moved to Portland, while Dr. Miller and a group of Portland dentists founded the Oregon College of Dentistry in 1898. After competing for a short time, the two dental schools merged in 1900 to create the North Pacific College of Dentistry. First located at northwest Fifteenth Avenue at Couch Street, the first class graduated in 1900 with five graduates. The school added the North Pacific College of Pharmacy in 1908, and moved into a new building in 1910 at the corner of northeast Sixth Avenue and Oregon Street. Also in 1908, the school changed its name to North Pacific College. The pharmacy school added a chapter of Kappa Psi (Beta Iota) in 1913. The school's building was expanded in 1921. That year, the North Pacific College of Optometry was added to the college. In 1940, alumnus Dr. Newton Uyesugi and Dr. Roy Clunas purchased the College of Optometry from Dr. Harry Lee Fording. After America's entry into World War II in 1941, the optometry school was closed in 1942 as Dr. Uyesugi was of Japanese ancestry and he was forced to relocate due to the Japanese exclusion orders. During World War II, the dental school was part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and in 1941 the pharmacy school closed. Another reason the optometry school was suspended in 1942 was that the head of the school joined the Navy. School founder Dr. Herbert Miller Dr. Miller, who headed the school from the beginning, had approached the state about the dental school becoming affiliated with the University of Oregon School of Medicine on many occasions. Then the American Dental Association, in an effort to raise standards for dental schools, denied continued accreditation for the dental school in 1944. Part of the reasoning was the lack of affiliation with a full-university, an issue Dr. Miller had long advocated for a solution by joining the University of Oregon. During the 1945 session of the Oregon Legislature, the assembly passed a law to allow for the school to join the University of Oregon. The school was then sold to the state for no cost, with the main provision being that the dental school remain in northeast Portland for at least five years. On July 1, 1945, North Pacific Dental College joined the University of Oregon. On August 1 of that same year the optometry program joined Forest Grove's Pacific University. The School of Optometry was located at northeast 41st Avenue and Sandy Boulevard. Legacy North Pacific College of Dentistry, Portland, Oregon, 1914 During its operation, the dental school graduated more than 3,300 dentists. The dental school still exists as the Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry. The optometry school still exists as the Pacific University College of Optometry. After the merger of the dental school into the University of Oregon‚Äôs medical school, a controversy arose over the relationship between the dental school and the university. Eventually members of the Oregon State Dental Association sued the Oregon State Board of Higher Education for a declaratory judgment on the interpretation of Chapter 160 of Oregon Laws 1945.State ex rel. Oregon State Dental Ass‚Äôn et al. v. Smith et al. (1954), 201 Or. 288; 270 P.2d 142. That law had merged the North Pacific College of Oregon‚Äôs dental program into the state‚Äôs medical school, and with it, established an advisory board made up of members of the Oregon State Dental Association to advise the state board on operating the school. The issue was whether the dental school was a subdivision of (the former) Oregon University System, or was it a subdivision of the University of Oregon. In 1954, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the dental college was a subdivision the higher education system, and not directly under the control of the University of Oregon.

The species is known from the late Eocene to early Oligocene sediments exposed in the state of Alaska, USA. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Macrantha. History and classification Acer dettermani is represented by a series of fossil specimens that were recovered from late Eocene to early Oligocene outcrops of the lower Meshik Volcanics, formerly called the Meshik Formation. The rocks were first named in 1929 by R.S. Knappen for material exposed along the Meshik River near Meshik Lake. In 1996 the sequence was reexamined and subsequently renamed the Meshick Volcanics by Robert L. Detterman and a group of researchers, to better reflect the lithology of the rocks. The age of the formation is considered to range from approximately to approximately . The rock section from which the fossils of Acer dettermani and a number of other plant fossils were recovered is a tuff layer that is exposed on the south flank of Mount Aniakchak's crater. Wolfe and Tanai interpreted the floral assemblage of Aniakchak as being a cool mesothermal forest composed of broad-leaf plants. The species was described from a pair of type specimens, the holotype leaf, specimen USNM 396014, and one paratype leaf, specimen USNM 396015. Both of the type specimens are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. dettermani in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name dettermani is in recognition of Robert L. Detterman for his many contributions to the understanding of the Alaska Peninsula's Tertiary stratigraphy. Description Leaves of Acer dettermani are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure, and are generally widely elliptic in shape. The leaves are shallowly three-lobed with the lateral lobes being about one half as long as the median lobe and all lobes being triangular in outline. The leaves have three primary veins, seven to eight secondary veins, and range between an estimated long by wide in overall dimensions. The overall morphology of A. dettermani suggests placement into the Acer section Macrantha. This is based on the shallow lobing with small uniformly sized teeth and the vein structure of the leaves.

Along with its armed wing, the South Sudan Defence Army (SSDA), rebelled against the government of South Sudan led by President Salva Kiir Mayardit and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement.Small Arms Survey - HSBA Baseline Assessment, Armed Groups: Athor Formation & First Rebellion The Movement was formed in 2010 by controversial former Sudan People's Liberation Army general George Athor after he failed to win the governorship of Jonglei in what was then the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan in the state of Jonglei as well as neighbouring Upper Nile in the Republic of South Sudan. Due to Athor's access to military support from the Sudanese & Eritrean Governments, he was able to attract other dissenting SPLA commanders such as Gatluak Gai in Unity State, David Yau Yau in Pibor county, and Shilluk commanders John Uliny and Alyuak Ogot in Upper Nile.SSDM/A-Athor Whilst the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) accused the North Sudanese government of supporting the SSDM, SPLA officials did not elaborate on what role they believe Khartoum's backing has played. Athor later signed a ceasefire agreement with the Government of South Sudan in January 2011, although the talks broke down and fighting re-erupted in February 2011. Other factions of the SSDM/A would later sign ceasefire agreements with the GOSS, with Yau Yau's faction signing one in June 2011, and Gai's in July 2011. Gai was allegedly murdered by his deputy in July 2011, although it is widely believed the SPLA were responsible, whilst Yau Yau, who had been stationed in Juba awaiting re-integration, would later defect to Khartoum in June 2012 and resume his factions insurgency in Jongeli in July 2012. Athor himself was killed on 19 December 2011 in Equatoria by South Sudanese troops whilst allegedly attempting to cross into South Sudan from Uganda, resulting in Peter Kuol Chol Awan becoming SSDM/A Commander-in-Chief. The South Sudanese Government announced that the SSDM/A had signed a peace deal in February 2012, and SSDM/A Commander-in-Chief Peter Kuol Chol Awan travelled to Juba and surrendered to the SPLA on 8 March 2012. This agreement was not accepted by all SSDM/A factions however, and John Uliny's faction in Upper Nile rejected the agreement, with John Uliny claiming leadership of the SSDM, and remaining active until mid 2013. Small remnants of Athor's original force in Pigi County also rejected the agreement, remaining active until August 2013. The bulk of Athor's forces - some 1,300 - had been disarmed, trained, and were awaiting formal re-integration in Oinykibol training centre in Eastern Equatoria in late September 2013. Structure Many SSDM fighters are from the Murle, a minority tribe that has long disputed herds of livestock and pasturing grounds with a fellow cattle ranching tribe, the Lou Nuer. Under Athor's leadership, Murle tribesmen repeatedly clashed with the Lou Nuer and the armed forces of South Sudan throughout much of 2011. SSDM/A - Cobra Faction The flag of the SSDA - Cobra Faction; a splinter of the wider SSDA, led by David Yau Yau. David Yau Yau had been one of the members of the original SSDM/A rebellion, joining following his failure to win a seat in the Jongeli state legislature in the 2010 elections. His main motivation was claimed to be the underdevelopment of Pibor County in Jonglei and the lack of local power-sharing with the Bor government. In the first SSDM/A rebellion Yau Yau's force was relatively small, with ~200 receiving presidential pardons following peace negotiations in June 2011. Yau Yau later returned to Pibor in July 2012 to restart his rebellion, having been dissatisfied with the integration package offered, and being opposed to the ongoing political marginalization of Murle people in Pibor county. The Cobra Faction later signed a peace agreement on 30 January 2014 which established the semi- autonomous Greater Pibor Administrative Area.http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/fileadmin/docs/working-papers/HSBA- WP35-Greater-Pibor.pdf In February 2015 a splinter from the Cobra Faction; the Greater Pibor Forces, joined with the forces of Riek Machar in the ongoing South Sudanese Civil War. In September 2016, however, the Cobra Faction was declared restored by some of its commanders and declared that it had resumed its struggle against the government. SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction The SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction was led by Shilluk commanders John Uliny and Alyuak Ogot, and was initially driven largely by disputes between the Shilluk community and the Upper Nile state government over land and county boundaries. Later motivations included revenge over the 2010 disarmament campaign, in which it was claimed the SPLA's 7th Division committed large scale abuses. The South Sudanese Government has claimed the Upper Nile Faction is linked with SPLM-DC, although SPLM-DC leader Lam Akol denies this.

The group was created in response to the Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which held that corporations have a First Amendment right to make expenditures from their general treasuries supporting or opposing candidates for political office, arguing that the Court's decision disrupts the democratic process by granting disproportionate influence to the wealthy. Move to Amend advocates for the \\"We the People\\" Amendment, currently in Congress as , to establish that constitutional rights are reserved for natural persons only and require the regulation and disclosure of spending in U.S. elections.  Background  In 2009, several national organizations including the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Program on Corporations, and Democracy (POCLAD) and Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County (DUHC) submitted an amicus curiae authored by former Massachusetts assistant attorney general Jeff Clements to the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a U.S. constitutional law case concerning the regulation of independent political expenditures by corporations, which the non-profit organization Citizens United challenged on the grounds of violating the First Amendment‚Äôs freedom of speech. The brief argued against Citizens United and called for the court to reverse its precedents on corporate personhood, citing the 1886 case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. that preceded the extension of constitutional protections to corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment. When the Court ruled to allow for corporations to make political expenditures from their general treasuries under the First Amendment's free speech rights in January 2010, several organizers and attorneys from those organizations behind the brief launched Move to Amend as a national campaign to overturn the Citizens United ruling, arguing that the Court‚Äôs decision disrupts the democratic process by granting disproportionate influence to the wealthy with the intent of promoting corporate power at the expense of ordinary citizens.  Resolutions and Ballot Campaigns  Move to Amend's strategy has included grassroots organizing to lobby elected officials and candidates to pass local resolutions and ordinances through municipalities, which call on state and federal representatives to support a 28th Amendment and may include holding a \\"Democracy Day\\" public hearing. As of July 2019, over 800 local governments and 20 states have passed resolutions and ordinances supporting a constitutional amendment to address the ‚Äò‚ÄôCitizens United‚Äô‚Äô ruling. Over 300 resolutions were passed by voters via ballot initiatives, including statewide initiatives in Colorado, Montana, California and Washington. Local affiliates of Move to Amend have helped pass many such resolutions supporting the language of the We the People Amendment, including the Los Angeles City Council which voted unanimously to end constitutional rights for corporations in 2011. In Ohio, local ordinances supporting the amendment and creating a \\"Democracy Day\\" public hearing to examine the local impact of political influence by corporations have been passed by municipal governments and voters via ballot initiatives, including Cleveland and Toledo. In Wisconsin, over 100 municipalities have passed resolutions, comprising 55% of Wisconsin residents.

It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussi√®lgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers Heugel and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris in 1880, Le M√©nestrel became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.Ellis (2007), pp. 2 and 25. Publishing history In 1827, Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis had founded La Revue musicale, France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834, it had two serious competitors, Le M√©nestrel established in 1833, and Maurice Schlesinger's Gazette Musicale, established in 1834. Le M√©nestrel was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussi√®lgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.Gautier (1995), p. 156; Le M√©nestrel (1 December 1833). In 1835, Schlesinger bought La Revue musicale from F√©tis and merged the two journals into La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris. Until La Revue et gazette ceased publication in 1880, Le M√©nestrel was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.Ellis (2007), p. 2. E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of Le M√©nestrel in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic Jules Lovy, who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836, Le M√©nestrel had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as Katharine Ellis pointed out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 cabinets de lecture, private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library, popular in early 19th-century France, where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.Ellis (2007), pp. 1-2 and 268‚Äì269.Martyn Lyons, Books: A Living History (Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011), p. 105.Harry Earl Whitmore, The \\"Cabinet de Lecture\\" in France, 1800‚Äì1850, in The Library Quarterly, vol. 48 no. 1 (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press). In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of Jacques-L√©opold Heugel and Jean-Antoine Meissonnier acquired Le M√©nestrel. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian Joseph d'Ortigue. Later editors-in-chief included Arthur Pougin who served from 1885 to 1921.Watanabe (1948). However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the masthead. When Jacques-L√©opold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.Le M√©nestrel, 3 February 1933, p. 52; Feurzeig (1994), p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001). Le M√©nestrel was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The Franco-Prussian War caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of World War I, with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that, following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the Paris Conservatory, the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.Le M√©nestrel, 24 May 1940. Original text: \\"Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, √† l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes impos√© pendant la premi√®re phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause imp√©rissable de la pens√©e et de l'art fran√ßais.\\" In the end, it proved to be the last issue of Le M√©nestrel. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to √âditions Alphonse Leduc. Notable people who wrote for the journal include Henri Duponchel, Max d'Ollone, Alphonse Royer and Paul Collin.

Lake founded the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa and was its first chairman and president. He was influenced by the healing ministry of John Alexander Dowie. Life and career Hezmalhalch was born to English parents in Paterson, New Jersey. His father operated a munitions foundry and young Hezmalhalch made shells for use by the Union soldiers during the American Civil War. After the Civil War he spent time in Leeds, England, where he ministered as a preacher of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. He married Charlotte Best and started a family while there. The Hezmalhalch's returned to California in 1884. Hezmalhalch purchased a property in Verdugo, now part of Glendale. He became the secretary to the local land improvement association. After returning to the United States he joined the Holiness Movement as a preacher and was baptized in the Holy Spirit during the summer of 1906. He recounted the experience that one night while riding on a horse he experienced the presence of God and began speaking in an unknown tongue. Hezmalhalch's missionary career began after he had an adulterous relationship with a fellow Pentecostal in Los Angeles. To rehabilitate him, William Seymour sent him in early 1907 to Zion, Il, where Charles Parham had established a Pentecostal community. This group of several hundred worshippers had been deserted by Parham, and Hezmalhalch's authority was soon established.B. Morton, \\"John G Lake's Formative Years: the Making of a Con Man\\", May 2014. John G. Lake and Fred Bosworth were prominent members of the \\"Parhamites\\", with the former rising to a position of co-leadership by mid-1907. After Parham's arrest for \\"the commission of an unnatural offense\\", the group descended into disorganization.Vinson Synan. The Holiness‚ÄìPentecostal Tradition: Charismatic Movements in the Twentieth Century. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1997, p. 106 n. Eventually, three members died gruesome deaths during botched exorcisms. Due to the massive outrage caused by these manslaughters, the Parhamites were forced to flee from Zion. Hezmalhalch, Lake, and Bosworth decamped to Indianapolis, where they assumed a leadership role amongst the local Pentecostals in late 1907. Once in Indianapolis, Hezmalhalch and Lake created several new narratives about their pasts in order to cover up their involvement in recent events. One of these narratives involved being called to go start a ministry in Africa. William Seymour gave his assent to this mission, and helped Hezmalhalch and Lake stage a fund-raising event in January/February 1908 in Indianapolis. The group raised the necessary funds, and the mission left in April. Lake and Hezmalhalch started their ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group and many who attended the first services were Zionists. These services formed the start of the Apostolic Faith Mission denomination (AFM) in South Africa. Most of the initial members were former Zionists who had been part of John Alexander Dowie's Zionist church. At the first meeting of the executive council of the new denomination on 27 May 1909, Hezmalhalch was elected chairman of the AFM. Lake was the real power in the AFM, and replaced him following a falling out in late 1909. Hezmalhalch, along with some other Pentecostals, accused Lake of a number of misdoings. Because Lake controlled the AFM executive, he quashed the charges, and Hezmalhalch was demoted to the provinces. Hezmalhalch was not a great preacher but he had a great influence on the early Pentecostal movement in South Africa. After a couple of desultory years following his demotion, he returned to the United States in 1912.

Early life Cr√≠spulo, was the son of Kapitan Carlos Aguinaldo and Trinidad Famy. He had five brothers namely (Primo, Benigno, Esteban, Ambrosio, and Emilio) and two sisters (Tomasa and Felicidad). He was known as 'Pulong' by his family members, he finished his early studies in his hometown and took up a Bachelor of Arts degree at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He was married to Irenea Arazaso of Kawit, in which they had seven children. Among their children, only one was named after him because it was his only son. He was a freemason and a Capitan Municipal Of Kawit, Cavite before the revolution. Revolutionary He joined the Katipunan, and his troops participated in the Battle of Binakayan on November 11, 1896. They were assigned at the rear position together with his cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo. They had defeated the Spanish forces headed by Governor General Ramon Blanco and Colonel Marina. He was also responsible in the insurgents in attacking the Spanish forces in Muntinlupa, Taguig and Pateros in Rizal Province. In February 1897, he joined his brother, Emilio, who was defending the town of Dasmari√±as, Cavite, from the troops of General Lachambre of the division of Captain-General Camilo Polavieja. The Spaniards were victorious in this battle, after which the Filipino forces evacuated the town after days of fighting. General Lachambre and General Antonio Zabala who was the commander of the Spanish forces in Dasmari√±as led the attack on Salitran, it was where Gen. Zabala and Cr√≠spulo met in a hand-to-hand combat which resulted in the death of Gen. Zabala.  Tejeros Assembly and death Cr√≠spulo attended the Tejeros Assembly on March 22, 1897, in San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), where his brother Emilio was voted as the president of the reorganized revolutionary government. Colonel Vicente Riego de Dios was sent by the assembly to fetch General Emilio Aguinaldo who was then in Pasong Santol. The General refused to come, so Cr√≠spulo was then sent to talk to his brother. He greeted his brother and explained his purpose, but Emilio was hesitant to leave because of the pending attack of the Spanish forces in Dasmari√±as and Imus. Cr√≠spulo didn't want to return to Tejeros without his brother, so he volunteered himself to stay behind in the area and promised that no Spaniard will take over Pasong Santol; that they would only take it over his dead body. On March 24, two days after Emilio left Pasong Santol, the Spaniards defeated the outnumbered Filipino defenders. Although wounded, Crispin fought gallantly and was killed during the battle at the age of 33.

During his reign, the Reformation was introduced in Lippe. Life Simon V was the fifth child and eldest son of Bernard VII \\"the Bellicose\\" and Anna of Holstein-Pinneberg and inherited Lippe after his father's death, around 1511. In 1528, he was raised to Imperial Count and Lippe became one of about 140 Imperial Counties. Since 1518, the Reformation had prevailed, first in Lemgo and then in other cities in Lippe. An open conflict arose in 1530 when Protestant hymns were sung during a Catholic Easter Mass. Simon, who remained a Catholic all his life, was outraged, and spoke of insurgent farmers who refuse to endure any authority over themselves. He was, however, a vassal of two liege lords: the Bishop of Paderborn and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, who had been a Lutheran since 1524. This limited his freedom to act. The cities in Lippe, in particular Lippstadt and Lemgo, also favoured a closer relationship with the Lutheran faith. Philip of Hesse urged the citizens of Lemgo to redress their dispute with Simon V; nevertheless, Lutheranism continued to spread in the cities. When in 1533, Simon sought support for military action against Lemgo, Philip intervened and mediated. Later that year, Lemgo adopted the Church Order and thus officially became Lutheran. In 1535, Simon V and Duke John III of Cleves invaded Lippstadt, which had turned Protestant. The city surrendered to its liege lord. The citizens of Lemgo were afraid that Simon V and John III would invade Lemgo as well, however, due to Philip's ongoing mediation, this did not happen.

This was the first story by Don Rosa story to be published in Finland, in 1990. Plot Donald's Nephews are practicing their animal identification skills for a field trip with the Junior Woodchucks. This gives Donald an idea: he wants to see his nephews meet an animal they can't identify, so he can claim to have been a better scout. Donald and his nephews go on a trip to the woods to spot wild animals. Donald heads to Grandma Duck's farm, disguises various animals as fantastical creatures from his own, wild imagination, and sends them off to meet the boys. However, the boys are able to identify each of them as mythological animals. The identifications were: a Gulon, a Mi'raj, a Basilisk, a Catoblepas, a Peryton, a Shadhahvar, an Eale, and a Barometz. Frustrated at this, Donald becomes obsessed with getting to humiliate his nephews, so he runs to Grandma's farm and begins disguising her horse. However, he has mistaken Grandma's new, more sanguine horse for her old, calmer one, and when the horse kicks Donald out of annoyance, everything goes out of control. The boys expect to see perhaps a griffin or a chimaera, but what they do see is a complete jumble of animal parts. Having to admit that they have finally seen an animal they can't identify, the boys end their trip and head back home. The story ends with Donald claiming he can show his nephews something they certainly can't identify: a genuine rustled-feathered, broken-jacketed Duckburgian peabrain. Notes According to Don Rosa, every single creature the boys identify the animals as really exists in some European or Asian mythology.

Task 13 was part of the IEA Solar Heating and Cooling Programme, to test the designs and techniques, and to monitor their performance. On average, the houses were designed to require 44 kWh/m¬≤, 75% lower than the average 172 kWh/m¬≤ that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards. (Analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60% ).

It takes its name from the Karst Plateau ().  Geographical distribution  The name of the dialect is somewhat misleading because its use is not limited to the Karst Plateau, nor does it encompass the entire Karst Plateau. It is spoken only in the northwestern parts of the Karst Plateau, in a line from the villages of Prosecco and Contovello near Trieste, west of Sgonico and Dutovlje. East of that line, the Inner Carniolan dialect is spoken.

Built in five parts as a set-piece residential development in the rapidly growing seaside resort, the main part of the crescent was designed between 1843 and 1847 by prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds and is one of his most distinctive compositions. Extra houses were added at both ends of the crescent in the mid-1850s. Unlike most other squares, terraces and crescents in Brighton, it does not face the sea‚Äîand the view it originally had towards the South Downs was blocked within a few years by a tall terrace of houses opposite. Montpelier was an exclusive and \\"salubrious\\" area of Brighton, and Montpelier Crescent has been called its \\"great showpiece\\". Wilds's central section has been protected as Grade II* listed, with the later additions listed separately at the lower Grade II. The crescent is in one of the city's 34 conservation areas, and forms one of several \\"outstanding examples of late Regency architecture\\" within it. History Brighton (originally known as Brighthelmston) developed as a large fishing and agricultural village on the English Channel coast. Despite intermittent periods of decline and destitution, it was the largest town in the county of Sussex by 1600. In the mid-18th century, the damaging economic effects of a terminal decline in the fishing industry were reversed by the new fashion for sea-bathing, and the town's new role as a seaside resort began.Berry, Sue (1988): Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography, in Northwest of the old town, around the parish church and the road leading to Devil's Dyke and on to London, was an expanse of gently sloping downland known as Church Hill. It was given over to sheep-grazing and was owned by two prominent locals: MP Thomas Kemp and John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. Helped by royal patronage (particularly from the Prince Regent) and good transport links to London and other important towns, Brighton grew rapidly in the early 19th century, and high-class suburbs were laid out. The completion in 1841 of the main railway line from London provided a further stimulus.Berry, Sue (1988): Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography, in By this time, Church Hill‚Äîideally situated close to the sea and the town's main attractions, largely undeveloped and with a pleasant southwesterly aspect‚Äîwas developing as a high-class residential area called Montpelier. Montpelier Road was laid out from 1820 as a major road running from the seafront to the Ditchling Road, past the house built in 1819 for the late Thomas Kemp's son Thomas Read Kemp. Prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds is believed to have designed it, although his father Amon Wilds may have been involved. ammonite capitals. Thomas Read Kemp's finances were overstretched by his involvement with the Kemp Town estate east of Brighton, and by the time he fled to France in 1837 he had sold or given away most of his landholding in the Montpelier area. Parcels of land were bought by builders and speculators, and a series of carefully planned \\"set-piece\\" residential developments were laid out. Work on Montpelier Crescent started in 1843, on and behind a stretch of Kemp's land previously occupied by a cricket pitch. The Lillywhite's Ground (also known as the Temple Fields Ground) was in use between 1831 and 1844 and was one of Brighton Cricket Club's venues. Amon Henry Wilds was commissioned to design the first set of houses; in view of the vast scale he worked to, which was unusual on a site so far inland from the coast, the crescent has been called \\"the grandest of his many works\\". The houses lacked a sea view, as they faced northwest towards the open land of the South Downs. The crescent was completed in 1847; within ten years, the downland vista had been obscured by the construction of Vernon Terrace opposite. This \\"impressive\\" set of four-storey terraced houses, dating from between 1856 and the mid-1860s, lined the west side of the former Montpelier Road, which by this stage had been renamed except for the stretch south of Denmark Villas. Between the east side of Vernon Terrace and the crescent, a curved area of green space was retained. The section completed in 1847, consisting of paired and tripartite groups of linked villas (a unique arrangement within Brighton), comprised house numbers 7 to 31 inclusive. Two wings flanking the original crescent were added in the mid-1850s, taking the number of houses to 38. They had a different, slightly less elaborate design: for example, they lacked the tall Classical-style pilasters and Wilds's characteristic ammonite capitals, as seen on the earlier houses. All houses were comparatively plain inside: features included characteristic Victorian decorative mouldings and wooden staircases. The crescent has changed little since its construction, although some buildings at the north end (adjacent to the present number 1) were demolished in the late 19th century to allow Seven Dials, a major road junction, to be built. The buildings are shown in a steel engraving dated approximately 1856, which also suggests that the crescent was closed at one end with railings which also continued around the gardens. Heritage \\"Very pleasant\\" open space survives in front of the crescent. The older central section of Montpelier Crescent (incorporating numbers 7‚Äì31) was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. The mid-1850s section were separately listed at the lower Grade II in four parts, covering numbers 1‚Äì3, 4‚Äì6, 32‚Äì33 and 34‚Äì38. Montpelier Crescent forms part of the Montpelier & Clifton Hill Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This area was designated by the council in 1973. Describing the crescent as \\"one of the architectural set-pieces for which [it] is rightly renowned\\" and \\"probably one of Brighton's most famous landmarks\\", the council has identified several features by which Montpelier Crescent contributes to the character of the conservation area. Good tree cover, both in the back gardens and in front of the crescent on the \\"very pleasant\\" green, the use of pale cream-coloured paint to improve the architectural harmony of the fa√ßades, the existence of a rare \\"Edward VII\\"-style pillar box, and the relationship with the \\"imposing\\" Vernon Terrace opposite, create \\"a townscape of outstanding quality\\". Architecture 1‚Äì3 Montpelier Crescent 4‚Äì6 Montpelier Crescent 32 and 33 Montpelier Crescent 34‚Äì38 Montpelier Crescent Work took place over the course of more than 10 years (Wilds completed the central section in 1847, and the other parts were added in about 1855), and the differences in design make the crescent \\"difficult to appreciate as a single composition\\". Despite this lack of coherence, the overall effect is of a \\"magnificent sweeping crescent\\". Each unit was designed as a villa-style mansion and was linked to its neighbours under large pediments. The development took place at the point in Brighton's development when Regency architecture was evolving into the Victorians' interpretation of the Italianate style. Amon Henry Wilds designed four landmark residential crescents, of which Montpelier Crescent was the third; the others were Hanover Crescent (Brighton), Park Crescent (Brighton) and Park Crescent (Worthing). Architectural historians have noted that Montpelier Crescent's inland-facing orientation \\"surprises\\": most squares and crescents in Brighton and Hove were built facing the sea, and its layout was accordingly unusual. Hanover Crescent was another example of a west/northwest- facing development, which may have encouraged Wilds to try the layout again. 1‚Äì3 Montpelier Crescent These three houses rise to three storeys and form a slightly outward-curving nine-bay composition whose outermost bays (containing the entrances for numbers 1 and 3) are recessed. The curved effect is much less pronounced than in the centre of the crescent. At first-floor level, a cast iron balcony supported on brackets spans the other seven bays. The houses are topped by a parapet which is supported on a modillion cornice and which continues round the side elevation of number 1, which faces Clifton Hill. Each house has a three-window range; those at first-floor level have architraves of various styles (flat cornices, curved pediments and triangular pediments), while at the top floor original sash windows survive. The doors, which are four-panelled and have decorative fanlights, are set in porches flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. The ground-floor walls are heavily rusticated. The roof has chimneys at the sides and is hidden behind the continuous parapet. 4‚Äì6 Montpelier Crescent Similar to their neighbours at the end of the crescent, these three houses have three windows to each of three storeys and have stuccoed, partly rusticated fa√ßades which curve outwards slightly. There are differences as well: the outer bays of the outermost houses are not recessed, every window is set in a moulded surround with pedimental architraves and \\"unusual\\" wreath-shaped decoration, and the slate-tiled roof (a hipped mansard) is visible behind the low parapet and cornice. The roof also has dormer windows. 7‚Äì31 Montpelier Crescent The 25 houses in the original section of the crescent form a northwest-facing concave curve. The composition consists of ten \\"blocks\\", each linked to the next by a recessed one- or two-storey wing and each with either two or three houses (a layout found nowhere else in Brighton). From north to south (starting at number 7) the pattern is 3‚Äì3‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì3. Each house is clad with stucco and painted pale cream. The crescent rises to three storeys throughout, except for the smaller linking bays, and most houses have parapets which hide their tiled roofs. Amon Henry Wilds did not use a consistent design for each building, and he used various decorative elements such as moulded wreaths and his characteristic ammonite capital design. Invented by George Dance the Younger but popularised by Wilds, the shell-shaped volutes of the capitals recall ammonite fossils. Other Wilds-built houses in Castle Place, Western Terrace, Oriental Place, Hanover Crescent, Old Steine and Montpelier Road display them. Each house has three windows to each storey (except numbers 24 and 25, with four each); in some cases, original sash windows survive, and window surrounds vary between straight-headed and round-arched. Many are flanked by small pilasters supporting an entablature. Each block is capped by a large pediment supported on full-height fluted Corinthian pilasters. Many of these pilasters are topped with ammonite capitals, and there are some slight differences: the pilasters at number 29 lack fluting, and those at number 30 have a panelled pattern. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. Some houses have cast iron balconies at either first- or ground-floor level; the latter are more intricate and are later additions. 32‚Äì33 Montpelier Crescent This pair of stucco-fronted houses are not symmetrical: number 32 (the more southerly of the two) has three windows to each storey, but number 33 has four. They are both flat-fronted with no curve, and share a slate mansard roof in which small dormer windows are inset. This spans the central five bays; the outermost bays are set back, have partly vermiculated quoins on their inner sides, and have an entrance (with a fanlight and a segmental arch) at ground-floor level. There are cast iron balconies at ground- and first- floor level; the former runs across the width of the building, whereas each first-floor window has an individual balcony. Some windows have decorative pediments and architraves. 34‚Äì38 Montpelier Crescent The northern end of Montpelier Crescent curves outwards and ends (at number 38) in a large projecting bay. At ground-floor level across the whole width of the five-house terrace is heavy rustication. The roof is hidden behind a parapet with a modillion cornice and a fourth (attic) storey with another cornice. Most of the windows have architraves or pediments (either curved or triangular) and are straight-headed. A continuous cast-iron balcony, supported on brackets and separated at intervals by stuccoed piers, spans the houses at first-floor level. Number 38's entrance faces Dyke Road at Seven Dials and has a two- storey entrance porch with decorative mouldings and pilasters.

Early life Dzhundrin was born in what is now the town of Rakovski. After the fourth section, he was sent to study in the Yambol seminary, from 1931 to 1934. After finishing school, he joined the Plovdiv Seminary. In 1939, he went to France and spent a year completing his novitiate under the Augustino- Assumptionist Fathers in the city of Nozeroy. From 1940 to 1944 he studied philosophy and theology. For health reasons, he moved to and continued his education in Lyon, where he received his priestly ordination on June 4, 1944. Career In 1947 he returned to Bulgaria to teach in St. Augustine college in Plovdiv. The government liquidated the college in 1948, causing him to move to Northern Bulgaria with Father Chonkov Assen. Bishop Eugene Bossilkov appointed him parish priest of the villages Bardarski Geran and Bregare. Father Assen was put on trial in 1952 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Father Dzhundrin returned to Plovdiv with him. Assen served his sentence in camps at Belene and Stara Zagora, and left in 1961. In Plovdiv, Samuel found that there was no spiritual work available. Thanks to a former acquaintance, he was accommodated in the village of Kaloyanovo as assistant parish priest. There, on December 14, 1978 he received the papal appointment to Bishop of Diocese of Nikopol. He was ordained on May 27, 1979 in St. Peter's Basilica by Pope John Paul II, with Cardinals Duraysami Lourdusami Simon and Eduardo Martinez Somaly. For 15 years he managed the diocese, until he retired in 1994 due to health issues.

IdeaPad K1 The IdeaPad K1 Tablet was announced in July 2011. The IdeaPad K1 tablet offered the following specifications: * Processor: NVIDIA Tegra T20 1.0 GHz * Operating system: Android 3.1 * Dimensions (inches): 10.4 x 7.4 x 0.5 * Weight: less than 1.7 pounds * Battery life: up to 10 hours * RAM: up to 1GB DDR2 * Storage: up to 64GB SSD * Connectivity: Bluetooth, 802.11b/g/n WiFi * Slots: MicroSD card reader * Ports: mini HDMI, optional docking port * Camera: 2 megapixel (front), 5 megapixel (rear) * Colors ‚Äì Black, White, Red * Full Flash support * Integrated cloud storage (2GB free) * Support: 1-year base system warranty, 2-year warranty extension plan More than 30 free apps were pre-loaded on the IdeaPad, including Angry Birds HD, Need for Speed: Shift, Kindle for Android, Documents To Go, and Norton Mobile Security. In its review, Gizmodo appreciated the value that the IdeaPad K1 represented, with the offer of a 32GB tablet for only $499. The reviewer described the Tablet as one of the most attractive that Gizmodo had reviewed, with its ‚Äúmatte, chrome-colored side and back trim and deep red back panel‚Äù. The IdeaPad K1 tablet featured interface improvements as compared to other Android 3.1 tablets. Gizmodo indicated that the battery life was above average for Android Tablets: 8 hours and 3 minutes, despite continuous Web surfing over Wi-fi. The IdeaPad K1 was summarized by LAPTOP Magazine as offering ‚Äúa strong mix of style, performance, and uniquely compelling enhancements to the Android 3.1 UI‚Äù. IdeaPad A1 The IdeaPad A1 Tablet was announced in September 2011. The PCWorld review indicated that the A1 would be the first 7-inch tablet prices at $200 or less. The reviewer stated that the low price was achieved through a reduction in storage capacity, not functionality. The basic unit offered 2GB of internal storage and other variants with more storage would be made available. The A1 contained a Micro SD card slot, which allowed expansion of up to 32GB. The A1 tablet was powered by a single-core 1 GHz Cortex A8 processor. It was suggested by the reviewer that the \\"single- core CPU may be the reason why no Honeycomb is on board, and may explain how Lenovo can achieve its aggressive price\\". A feature indicated to be \\"most notable for a tablet at this price\\" was the capacitive touch screen. This was in contrast to the resistive touch screen found on value tablets. The display also offered a higher-than average resolution, of 1024x600 pixels and 170 pixels per inch (ppi). The ppi value made the display sharper than even that of the Apple iPad 2, which offered only 132 ppi on a 9.7-inch screen. The fact that the A1 included Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) as opposed to Android 3.2 (Honeycomb), was indicated to be a point of concern. The reviewer said that those companies which did incorporate Android 2.2 or 2.3 only achieved this by making significant customizations to the on-board apps as well as the interface. At the time of announcement, Lenovo had not provided information on what customizations had been made, if any. The IdeaPad A1 tablet was 0.47 inches thin and weighed 0.88 lbs. The A1 offered four different colors: white, black, pink, and light blue. A feature of the A1 announced by Lenovo was the inclusion of a magnesium alloy roll cage, which protected internal components through bumpers. Another key feature of the A1 was the GPS which did not require a data connection to be used. IdeaPad P1 The IdeaPad P1 Tablet was different from both the IdeaPad K1 and ThinkPad Tablets in that it featured Windows 7 as the operating system instead of Android 3.1. Additionally, unlike the K1 and ThinkPad Tablets, the P1 Tablet included an Intel Atom processor as opposed to an NVIDIA Tegra processor. Lenovo IdeaPad P1 Windows tablet also preloaded with Adobe Flash Player 10.3, Lenovo App Shop, Microsoft Security Essentials and Lenovo App Manager for switch from entertainment to productivity apps like send email, games, or watch the online movies. The specifications of the IdeaPad P1 are as follows: * Processor: Intel Atom 1.5 GHz * Operating system: Windows 7 * Display: 10.1 inch, 1280x800 capacitive touchscreen with support for an optional capacitive stylus * RAM: up to 2GB DDR2 * Storage: up to 64GB SSD * Connectivity: Bluetooth, optional 3G, WiFi * Camera: 2MP front-facing webcam * Ports: USB 2.0, docking port * Slots: Micro SD * Audio: 1.5W speaker, microphone, headset connectors * Weight: 1.75 lbs * Dimensions (inches): 10.9 x 0.57 x 7.24 * Battery life: 6 hours  References   External links  * IdeaPad Tablets Android (operating system) devices IdeaTab tablets Tablet computers Windows 7 ","title":"IdeaPad tablets"},{"id":"34189018","text":"Brad Gilbert was the defending champion, but did not take part in the U.S. National Indoor tennis tournament that year.

Life  He was the son of Landgrave Balthasar of Thuringia and his first wife, the Hohenzollern princess Margaret of Nuremberg. His father had received the Landgraviate of Thuringia in the 1382 Division of Chemnitz and was able to largely extend his territories in several skirmishes with the local nobility. After the death of his first wife Margaret in 1391, he secondly married the Ascanian princess Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg. Landgrave Balthasar planned to marry his son off to Elizabeth of G√∂rlitz, a grand- daughter of the late Luxembourg emperor Charles IV; nevertheless, these attempts had already failed, when Frederick succeeded his father in 1406. One year later he married Countess Anna (d. 1431), the daughter of Count G√ºnther XXX of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg. Their marriage remained childless. Frederick is considered a relatively weak ruler, who was at times very dependent on the influence of his wife and her relatives. To finance his lavish court, he sold more and more land and titles. In 1436, he had all Jews expelled from Thuringia. After Frederick's death without heirs, Thuringia was inherited by his two Wettin cousins, Elector Frederick II of Saxony and his brother William III. He had already sold them the more remote areas of Meissen some years earlier for . The succession led to the 1445 Division of Altenburg and the subsequent Saxon Fratricidal War.

He joined the Soviet partisans behind the German front lines in September 1941. Rejoining the Red Army after two years with the partisan, Colonel Basanets was appointed commanding officer of the 235th Rifle Division in 1943 and commanding officer of the 192nd Rifle Division in 1944-1945. Promoted to major-general on 6 May 1945, he led the 192nd Rifle Division during the Soviet invasion of Japanese Manchuria (Manchukuo) in August 1945. Biography Luka Basanets was born in 1898 in the Chernigov Governorate village of Kushkyne (Kushkino) in the Russian Empire (now in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine). He was an ethnic Ukrainian from a peasant family.Lurye, V. M. & V. Ya. Kochik (2002). GRU: Dela i Lyudi. Moscow: OLMA. p. 343. . Basanets entered the military during World War I, having been conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army for service as a private in February 1917. He joined the newly formed Red Army of Soviet Russia in 1918 and became a member of the Bolshevik Party in 1919. Basanets fought on the Western Front of the Russian Civil War from August 1918 until February 1920, then went on to Moscow to attend the Red Army's 1st Moscow Infantry Course from February 1920 to July 1920. He later attended infantry courses in Kyiv in 1921-1923 and the Vystrel Higher Infantry Officers' Courses in 1928-1929. A platoon and company commander in the 1920s, he was promoted to battalion commander in 1929 and studied at the Frunze Military Academy in 1932-1936. Basanets worked in the military intelligence service after his graduation from the Frunze Military Academy, serving at the disposal of the Intelligence Directorate of the Red Army Staff in May 1936. Awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1937, he was next named an assistant of the commanding officer of the 51st Rifle Division in December 1938. He was relieved of his assignment with the 51st Rifle Division to take control of the 140th Rifle Division as commanding officer in August 1939. Part of the 36th Rifle Corps of Lieutenant- General Ivan Muzychenko's 6th Army at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the 140th Division sustained heavy casualties in early July 1941. The division was subsequently encircled and destroyed by the Germans, though Basanets managed to escape, joining the Soviet partisans to fight behind the German front lines in September 1941. He managed to cross through the German lines after two years with the partisans, rejoining the regular army in 1943. Colonel Basanets was named commanding officer of the 235th Rifle Division of Lieutenant-General Konstantin Golubev's 43rd Army in July 1943 in place of Colonel Alexey Kubasov, who was reassigned to take charge of the 269th. He was succeeded as commander of the 235th by Colonel Andrey Yatsun in October 1943. In October 1944, Colonel Basanets succeeded the wounded Colonel Konstantin Popov as commander of the 192nd Rifle Rifle Division of Lieutenant-General (later Colonel-General) Ivan Lyudnikov's 39th Army. Alongside the rest of the 39th Army, the division took part in the East Prussian Offensive in the East Prussia Province of Germany as part of Army General Ivan Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front in late 1944 - early 1945. Promoted to major-general, on 6 May 1945, Basanets led the 192nd Rifle Division during the Soviet war with Imperial Japan in the August 1945 invasion of Manchuria (Manchukuo), for which the 39th Army crossed the Greater Khingan on the Mongolia-Manchukuo border, fighting as part of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's Transbaikal Front. Major-General Basanets remained with the 192nd Rifle Division until its return to the Soviet Union in October 1945, a month after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Major-General Basanets retired after the war. He died in Odesa in 1962.

The genus and species were described by L√©ger & Duboscq in 1909L√©ger & Duboscq 1909 C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 149, 364 The specific name is derived from the appearance of the trophozoites which possesses aspects of both the coccidia and gregarines. Description The mechanism by which the parasites enter the gasterointestinal tract of the lobster is not known this stage may (or may not) involve an intermediate host. Within the lobster the trophozoites are vermicular in form similar those of the gregarines. These enter an entrocyte, divide three times to give rise to an octonucleate schizont. The schizont divides and gives rise to eight merozoites which then invade other entrocytes. There may be several rounds of asexual reproduction. At some point smaller merozoites are formed. These are of two sizes one smaller than the other. The smaller merozoites invade the entrocytes, and become octoploid. These then divide and give rise to eight vermicular microgameocytes. These gametocytes invade entercyets and there undergo multiple divisions which are released into the lumen as microgametes. The larger merozoites divide within the lumen of the gut twice giving rise to a four nucleated schizont. The schizont divides into four macrogametocytes which then invade the cells of the gut wall where they mature into macrogametes. Fertilization occurs and a zygote is formed. Sporogony does not appear to occur in this genus.

It was invented by Lars Ahlfors * Algebra: a major part of pure mathematics centered on operations and relations. Beginning with elementary algebra, it introduces the concept of variables and how these can be manipulated towards problem solving; known as equation solving. Generalizations of operations and relations defined on sets have led to the idea of an algebraic structure which are studied in abstract algebra. Other branches of algebra include universal algebra, linear algebra and multilinear algebra. * Algebraic analysis: motivated by systems of linear partial differential equations, it is a branch of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that uses methods from sheaf theory and complex analysis, to study the properties and generalizations of functions. It was started by Mikio Sato. * Algebraic combinatorics: an area that employs methods of abstract algebra to problems of combinatorics. It also refers to the application of methods from combinatorics to problems in abstract algebra. * Algebraic computation: see symbolic computation. * Algebraic geometry: a branch that combines techniques from abstract algebra with the language and problems of geometry. Fundamentally, it studies algebraic varieties. * Algebraic graph theory: a branch of graph theory in which methods are taken from algebra and employed to problems about graphs. The methods are commonly taken from group theory and linear algebra. * Algebraic K-theory: an important part of homological algebra concerned with defining and applying a certain sequence of functors from rings to abelian groups. * Algebraic number theory: a part of algebraic geometry devoted to the study of the points of the algebraic varieties whose coordinates belong to an algebraic number field.

The game was released for download through DSiWare on May 9, 2011 in North America and May 27, 2011 in Europe. It was the last game officially released for the Nintendo DS in Japan. Gameplay Mighty Milky Way tasks players with guiding Luna, a French-speaking extraterrestrial, safely towards a portal at the end of each level while avoiding enemies and electric barrels. Each level is filled with small planets, each with their own center of gravity, which Luna walks around clockwise at a speed controlled by the player. By kicking off of planets, in some cases destroying them, Luna can propel herself through space in a specific direction, sometimes swayed by a planet's gravity. Kicking off a planet also causes any enemies on it to fly off its orbit, which can be used to destroy other obstacles. By collecting pieces of candy, Luna can create additional planets to help her navigate difficult sections. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewing for IGN, Lucas M. Thomas praised the game's unusual design, and described the game as challenging. Thomas said the game requires repeated attempts for each level but that \\"Mighty Milky Way's frustrations almost always feel like the good kind\\".

She was also the mother of U.S. Senator Max Baucus of Montana and longtime matriarch of the Baucus family. Her work as a historian focused primarily on the history of Montana and the American West. Life and work Baucus was born Jean Sheriff on July 7, 1917, in Helena, Montana, the daughter of Frederick B. and Bernice F. Sheriff. Her paternal grandparents were Court and Mary (Hooper) Sheriff and her maternal grandparents were Henry and Alberta (Gordon) Sieben. In 1896, her maternal grandfather, Henry, purchased a ranch approximately twenty miles north of Helena, which stretches from Missouri River to Little Prickly Pear Creek. The land, which became known as the Sieben Ranch, remains a property of the Baucus family, owned by her son and daughter- in-law, John and Nina Baucus. Jean Sheriff was raised in both Helena and the Sieben Ranch. She attended Hawthorne School and graduated from Helena High School. She received her bachelor's degree in economics in 1939 from Stanford University. In 1941 she gave birth to Max Sieben Enke, and later, her second child, Karen, with her first husband, Stephen Enke, Ph.D., a demographer and economist. When Max was two years old, Jean Sheriff left California and returned to Montana. Baucus married her second husband, John J. Baucus, in 1946 and had a child with him, John. Her oldest son, Max, took his stepfather's last name and, as Max Baucus, entered politics, eventually becoming a U.S. senator from Montana. She was widowed in 1996. Baucus authored four nonfiction books focusing on the history of Helena and Montana including \\"Helena: Her Historic Homes, Vols. 1 and 2\\", which were released during the late 1970s, and \\"Gold in the Gulch,\\" published in 1981. Another work, \\"Helena: An Illustrated History,\\" which she co-authored with editor Vivian Paladin, was first published in 1983 by the Montana Historical Society. Baucus also wrote \\"Henry Sieben, 1846-1937: Legacy of Livestock and Land\\", a biography of her grandfather. Her arts patronages included Holter Museum of Art in Helena.

This genus and family was created in 1984 for the species Eimeria funduli because of morphological differences in the sporocyst suggested that it was not a typical member of the genus Eimeria.Overstreet RM, Hawkins WE, Fournie JW (1984) The Coccidian Genus Calyptospora n. g. and Family Calyptosporidae n. fam. (Apicomplexa), with members infecting primarily fishes. J Euk Micro 31 (2) 332‚Äì339 The type species is Calyptospora funduli. Life cycle These parasites infect the livers of their fish hosts which they appear to reach via the gastrointestinal tract. They have an obligatory intermediate host - usually a shrimp - in which they infect the enterocytes of the shrimp gut. The life cycle appears to be as follows: infected fish excrete the parasites from their gastrointestinal tract into which they are secreted with the bile. An intermediate host such as a shrimp ingests the parasite which then decysts and infects the gut wall of the shrimp. The shrimp is then ingested by a fish whereupon the parasite is released and invades the fish's gut wall. The parasites then travel via the blood stream to the liver wherein they mature. Description The sporocyst lacks Stieda bodies and sub-Stieda bodies, has a veil supported by sporopodia and has an anterior apical opening. A suture may be present but if present it does not completely divide the sporocyst into two valves. Phylogenetics This clade appears to be monophyletic and a sister group to the genus Eimeria.Whipps CM, Fournie JW, Morrison DA, Azevedo C, Matos E, Thebo P, Kent ML (2012) Phylogeny of fish-infecting Calyptospora species (Apicomplexa: Eimeriorina).

Life  Born in Prague, John was the third son of Emperor Charles IV (1316‚Äì1378) from his fourth marriage with the Griffin princess Elizabeth (c.1347‚Äì1393), daughter of Duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania. He was baptized Johann to commemorate his grandfather King John of Bohemia. At the age of three, he was given the titles of a margrave of Moravia and Brandenburg, however, these lands were actually ruled by his uncle John Henry and his elder half-brother Wenceslaus. In 1377, one year before his death, Emperor Charles IV provided for his younger son the bailiwick of G√∂rlitz in the Bohemian crown land of Upper Lusatia, which he raised to a duchy in its own right. John's ducal lands also comprised the eastern areas of adjacent Lower Lusatia and southern parts of the Brandenburg Neumark territory. John remained the first and only duke (Herzog) of this newly established duchy. He was raised at the Praguel court under the tutelage of his elder half-brother Wenceslaus, elected King of the Romans in 1376 and Charles' successor on the Bohemian throne in 1378. Coming of age, he took his residence in G√∂rlitz, then a prosperous city and member of the Lusatian League. In 1385 King Wenceslaus consigned him administration of Brandenburg, then formally under the rule of John's half- brother Sigismund and given in pawn to their cousin Margrave Jobst of Moravia three years later. Between 1386 and 1388, he was also administrator of the Duchy of Luxembourg. In his G√∂rlitz duchy, John turned out to be a capable rule. After pogroms in Prague in 1389, however, he issued a decree expelling the Jews, contrary to the privilege granted to the Jews in the neighbouring Bautzen (Budissin) area by bailiff Bene≈° Berka z Dub√© in 1383. His chancellor and closest confidant during his entire reign was Olbram of ≈†kvorec, the Archbishop of Prague. Duke John remained a loyal supporter of King Wenceslaus, whose position in the Empire increasingly attenuated. When during the struggles with his cousin Jobst of Moravia in 1394, Wenceslaus was arrested and kept prisoner (8 May - 1 August) in Austria, he was only set free after John occupied Prague, raised an army at Kutn√° Hora (Kuttenberg), and campaigned the lands of the insurgent Rosenberg family to intervene for his brother. Wenceslaus was finally released after he signed a treaty in benefice of the German princes and returned to Bohemia. Left without any reward for his loyalty, John soon after turned away from Wenceslaus and retired to his G√∂rlitz duchy. Marriage and issue On 10 February 1388 in Prague, John married Richardis Catherine (d. 1400), a daughter of Duke Albert III of Mecklenburg, who ruled as King of Sweden from 1364 to 1389. Their only child was a daughter, Elizabeth of G√∂rlitz (1390-1451), Duchess of Luxembourg upon the death of Jobst of Moravia in 1411, who married firstly, in 1409, Duke Anthony of Brabant (1384-1415) and after his death, in 1418 the Wittelsbach duke John III of Bavaria. John died suddenly at the age of 25, probably poisoned, while he stayed at Neuzelle Abbey in Lower Lusatia.Paul Fahlisch: Chronik der Stadt L√ºbbenau im Spreewald, 2nd printing, L√ºbbenau, 1928, p. 12 After his death, his duchy was dissolved and the pre-1377 borders were restored.

History  In 1656, during the Qing Dynasty, Shih Tsu Fu Lin called on the famous shaman Wukang Yu Lin, and let him live in Wanshan Hall (). Due to their similar interests, they quickly became friends. They only regretted that they had not met sooner. After that, Fu Lin bestowed the name \\"Buddhist Monk Dajue\\" () on Yu Lin, and later Yu Lin was elevated to \\"Universal and Benevolent Emperor's Teacher Dajue\\" (). In 1675, the aged emperor's teacher Yu Lin wandered alone. He stayed for the night in Ciyun Temple in Huai'an House and died there. Eventually, the temple got its new name \\"Ciyun Buddhist Temple\\" because of Yu Lin's arrival.  Present condition  At present, the rebuilt Shanmen Hall () has an inscription of \\"Ciyun Buddhist Temple\\" written by Kulapati Zhao Puchu (), the chairman of the Buddhist Association of China. Hall of the Heavenly King (), Tripitaka Hall () and Hall of the Emperor's Teacher () have been completely renovated. The original storehouses were reconstructed into the Holy Triad Hall (), Ti-tsang Hall (), Kwan-yin Hall (), mediation abodes, a dining hall, and dormitories for monks. The rebuilt Ciyun Temple was officially opened to the public in 1994. Master Jueshun (), with the other masters and kulapatis, has retaken Ciyun Street ().

At high school Thompson formed the Southern Melody Boys, who made a recording which led from a radio session. \\"I Feel the Blues Coming On\\" was sung by Thompson and gave them another radio appearance on the \\"Louisiana Hayride\\" show. Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi. He relocated to Memphis, Tennessee and made an unreleased recording in 1956. \\"Love My Baby\\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside Sonny Burgess and Billy Lee Riley. The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to Chicago, Illinois, where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue. Thompson's recording of \\"$16.88\\" for Kapp Records sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album. Here's Hayden Thompson was released in 1967. Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.

The original Kingscote Park was demolished in 1951. Both houses formed part of the manor of Kingscote which was held by the Kingscote family from the 12th century and is mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Chingescote'.

In April 1829, the grounds were described in The Gardener's Magazine as 'A fine place; the pleasure-grounds extensive, and within the last five years greatly improved'. In 1914, Frank Henry, writing of Colonel Sir Robert Nigel Fitzhardinge Kingscote, who owned Kingscote Park until his death in 1906, describes 'one of the finest racecourses in England' being in the estate grounds, 'although it has not been used for that purpose since 1825'. Also, of 'a secluded dell in the Park' where 'many prize fights were contested'. In 1915, the house was described as 'a large and handsome building of stone, in a well-wooded park of about 300 acres'. The owner was Nigel Richard Fitzhardinge Kingscote, of 4 Southwich Crescent, Hyde Park, but the estate was leased to John Jameson Cairness, who resided there. Following the Second World War the house was neglected and fell into disrepair. It was demolished in 1951, with building materials being re- used in new buildings in the Kingscote area. The stables, built in 1862, and former coach house remain and are grade II listed. The former walled garden is now part of a small housing development. Kingscote Cottage The cottage's origins date to a building, possibly a farmhouse, from the 18th century. It was enlarged in the 1790s and then extended, again, in the mid-1800s. It was the dower house to the original Kingscote Park. In the 1820s, the cottage was home to the family of John Wedgwood, founder of the Royal Horticultural Society. In the 1930s and 40s, Lieut-Col. Ardern Arthur Hulme Beaman, High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, occupied the cottage, which he called 'Kingscote Grange',A. A. H.

History The chancel The Grade II* listed church is dedicated to Mary Magdalene and is described as a small building in the Perpendicular style, \\"nobly lying on raised ground\\". The current building dates to the 16th century and was restored by S. S. Teulon in 1855 and Arthur Blomfield in 1890. It is considered to be a noteworthy example of a carrstone building. It is located in the park and is approached from Sandringham House through the garden by \\"an avenue of fine old Scotch firs\\". Much of the decoration and the church's stained glass in the east window was created by Charles Eamer Kempe whom King Edward VII had also commissioned in 1903 to create a stained glass window for Buckingham Palace of his eldest son, Prince Albert, Duke of Clarence. The church's silver altar and reredos were presented to Queen Alexandra by the American department store owner, Rodman Wanamaker, as a tribute to Edward VII. He also presented her with the silver pulpit and a silver 17th-century Spanish processional cross. Of note also is a Florentine marble font and a Greek font dating to the 9th-century.

The 28-acre initial site was built with $40 million in private funds and opened on September 27, 2011. It is projected to take 40,000 long haul trucks off Long Island roads and handle 1 million tons of freight a year by 2016. It includes 13,000 feet of new track, with three tracks for construction material, such as asphalt and concrete, and six tracks for merchandise, such as flour and biodiesel. Operations Train operations on the site are handled by U.S. Rail of New York, LLC (reporting mark USRNY), a Class III shortline railroad formed to operate the facility. Two EMD GP38 locomotives are used for on-site switching, while rail cars are delivered and picked up by the New York and Atlantic Railroad which operates over the Long Island Rail Road Main Line. The site was chosen to minimize residential and traffic impacts: it is close to exit 66 on the Long Island Expressway and 1/4 mile from the nearest home. (A proposal for a similar facility at the former Pilgrim State Hospital, 18 miles to the west, was stymied by local opposition.) Adjacent tracts totaling an additional 93 acres are available for further expansion, including possible facilities for intermodal containers and refrigerated storage. The facility expected to handle over 10,000 railcars in its first full operating year. The Town of Brookhaven originally tried to stop the project claiming in 2007 that BRT had not received proper approvals from the town nor environmental impact review. However in 2010 the town settled with the developers after being advised that the federal Surface Transportation Board likely had jurisdiction over the project. The settlement included mitigation measures, such as dust controls, storm water retention, a visual landscape barrier, replanting 30% of the property, and $1 million in payments to the town. Under the agreement, the site is not to be used for loading or processing solid waste.Brookhaven Rail Terminal closes on adjacent property, Linda Leuzzi, The Long Island Advance, January 26, 2012 As of mid-2012, the facility is handling three commodities, construction aggregate, flour and biodiesel.

BRT intends to build track on its additional property in the form of a stub-end loop, with trainload and terminal facilities along three sides of the loop. In March 2014, the Town of Brookhaven filed a lawsuit attempting to stop work on BRT‚Äôs planned expansion. BRT, in response, asked the Surface Transportation Board for a declaratory order that the new rail track under construction is a spur track, and therefore is under the STB‚Äôs exclusive jurisdiction and is not subject to licensing requirements or environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act. According to BRT‚Äôs filing, the facility has experience strong traffic growth and its original 28-acre parcel is close to capacity, with all tracks in use. In 2014 BRT has averaged 130 rail cars per month and has 11 major customers. Commodities include lumber and building supplies for Home Depot and other companies, flour for several commercial bakeries, and biodiesel. Two tracks are used for arrival and departure trains, with a third \\"runner track\\" which allows the NY&A; locomotives that deliver a train to return to the inbound end of the departing train. Four 1100-foot stub tracks and a track to the Home Depot facility are used for freight unloading.

The school believes that \\"Every Child is born Creative\\". The basic purpose of the system is to develop the child's intrinsic learning processes. Based on the information processing model of learning, it attempts to develop seven basic competencies called Core Creative Competencies (C3): concentration, power of observation, memory, thinking, imagination, emotional management, and communication/expression power. The system is based in traditional Yogic cultural practices, but integrates them into modern learning systems. The content of learning is selected specifically for each child, taking into account the child's personality, family, and social environment. Through the use of monitoring and evaluation, the materials are regularly adapted to the child's strengths and weaknesses. The system used by the school is published in the book Creative Learning: A Handbook for Teachers & Trainers, by Shri Vijoy Prakash, Founding Executive President of APCL.

Biography He was educated at the Latin school and gymnasium in Bremen, and at the theological academy of Groningen. Having received a call to the Dutch church of Kingston, New York, he was ordained on 31 March 1763, and sailed for New York with Jacob R. Hardenbergh. In 1764 he was compelled by the civil authorities to take the oath of allegiance to Great Britain. Meyer found the church divided by the old quarrel of the Coetus and Conferentie parties as to whether ordination should take place in this country or in the Netherlands. He sympathized with the Coetus party in favor of a ministry trained in America, and his pungent preaching caused dissatisfaction. The ecclesiastical difficulties culminated in his suspension from active duties by an illegal body of Conferentie ministers in 1766, and for nearly seven years he remained in Kingston, preaching to his adherents in private houses. He was a member of the convention of 1771, which reunited his church. In 1772, he moved to New Jersey as pastor at Pompton and Totowa (now Paterson). The general synod elected him to two chairs in their theological institution ‚Äî that of Hebrew in 1784, and that of lector in divinity in 1786, which he held until his death. In 1789 he received the degree of D.D. from Queen's College (now Rutgers). He left in manuscript a Latin translation of the Psalms of David, with commentaries and emendations. Family On May 25, 1764, he married Rachel Hardenbergh of Rosendale, New York. They had four children.

Population: predominantly Chechen. History It was the first settlement of Chechen-Akkints in the Kumyk Plain. It was previously known as Shircha-Akka, Shircha-Evla, Yurt-Evla, and Yurt-Aukh. Yurt-Aukh, as it was then called, was until 1944 a part of the Aukh District. In 1944, during the deportation of Chechens to Central Asia, the locals were deported and Avars from the neighboring selo of Almak settled in their place. In 1956, the Chechens were allowed to return to the Caucasus, but the local authorities prohibited their return directly to their ancestral villages in former Aukhovsky District. Only several years later the Chechens were able to start buying back their houses from the Avars. On August 27, 2007, a clash between over one hundred Chechens and Avars took place in Kalininaul, resulting in eight people injured.

History  To celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the new (Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception) of Linz, bishop Franz-Josef Rudigier asked Bruckner for a cantata. Bruckner responded enthusiastly with the composition of the Festive Cantata Preiset den Herrn (Praise the Lord) on a text of the theologian Maximilian Pammesberger. On 1 May 1862 the foundation stone was laid. To celebrate the event the cantata was performed by the choir Frohsinn, invited guest singers and the brass band of the Infantry Regiment Freiherr von Bamberg No. 13 under the baton of Engelbert Lanz.J.

It is published in volume XXII/2 no. 6 of the .Gesamtausgabe ‚Äì Kantaten und Chorwerke mit Orchester The Festive Cantata, WAB 16, is the first notable religious work that Bruckner composed after his strenuous study period by Sechter. It will be followed one year later by Psalm 112 (1863), and again one year later by the secular cantata Germanenzug and the first great mass, Mass No. 1 in D minor (1864).  Text  The cantata uses a text of the theologian Maximilian Pammesberger. :{  style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"Praise the Lord, Sing the praises of His holy name!

This is the house of the Immaculate, In which the source of grace Arises and streams rich and pure Into the country. The tribes from all the districts of the country Go on a devout pilgrimage to the cathedral Of our blessed Lady; They greet her times without number And find salvation in the room of grace By faith and trust. Praise the Lord, Sing the praises of His holy name, Praise Mary, The mighty helper. Amen. }  Setting  The 241-bar long work in D major for men's chorus, male solo quartet, bass soloist, and wind band (2 flutes, 2 oboes, 4 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 bass tuba and timpani),Anton Bruckner Critical Complete Edition - Cantatas and choral works with orchestra is composed of eight short parts: # Opening choir: \\"Preiset den Herrn\\", D major veering to F minor - Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell # Aria: \\"Taue deine Kraft und St√§rke\\", A major veering to F major - Solo quartet a cappella, choir repeat with woodwinds (flute, clarinet and bassoon) - Langsam, bittend # Bridging choir: \\"Preiset den Herrn\\", D major - Bewegt, nicht zu schnell # Arioso: \\"Aus der Erde Scho√ü\\", G major - Bass soloist - Langsam, nicht schleppend # Aria: \\"Das ist der Unbefleckten Haus\\", E major - Solo quartet a cappella with internal repetition ‚Äì Langsam bewegt # Prelude by reed instruments (clarinets and bassoons), E major veering to G major # Chorale: \\"Des Landes St√§mme wallen fromm\\", a cappella, G major # Final choir \\"Preiset den Herrn\\", D major - Bewegt, nicht zu schnell Total duration: 10 to 13 minutes. The opening choir with its starting octave leap in unison, as in the Overture in G minor, and its reminiscence to the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus from H√§ndel‚Äôs Messiah - on which Bruckner often made improvisations - is majestic and solemn. It thereafter evolves in a fugato on \\"Grund und Eckstein bist du, o Herr\\". To bind the work together the solemn opening choir is repeated twice, in the third and eight parts.  Selected discography  A commercial recording in full accordance with the original score edited by the critical Gesamtausgabe is still awaited. Out of the seven commercial recordings, Fiala's live performance - with trombones colla parte during the choir repeat of part 2 (mm. 70-82) - is the most in accordance with the original score. Kerbl's live recording - with organ colla parte for a cappella parts 2, 5 and 7 - is, according to Hans Roelofs, also a convincing performance.Roelofs' critical discography of Bruckner's Festkantate The Festive Cantata has undergone several adaptations: for choir, only with organ accompaniment, for mixed choir with a different text ... The two recordings by Track follow his own adaptations, one for male-voice choir (1990), the other as Festkantate zur Weihnacht (festive Christmas cantata) for mixed choir with Herbert Vogg‚Äôs text \\"Ehre sei Gott in der H√∂he\\" (1996). :In the version for male-voice choir the Arioso (part 4) is skipped. Parts 2 and 5 are accompanied by organ, part 7 is sung a cappella. :In the version for mixed choir (Festkantate zur Weihnacht) part 4 is sung by the male voices with the original instruments, parts 2, 5 ‚Äì converted to C major ‚Äì and 7 are sung by the whole choir with organ. Because of the female voices and the organ accompaniment this version sounds smoother than the original version. * Martin L.

Prior to the early 20th century, the Finnish Spitz and the Karelo- Finnish Laika were considered the one breed and were common across the Karelia region of eastern Finland and north-western Russia. The events of the Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War and the Winter War saw large parts of Karelia ceded to Soviet Russia and much bitterness on both sides of the border, Russian advocates of the breed renamed dogs on their side of the border the Karelo-Finnish Laika. In the 1950s, Russian breeders imported 2 male and 1 female Finnish Spitz dogs and crossed them with the red-coated spitzes found in southern Karelia - the Olonets Laika and the Karelian Laika. These dogs had a conformation very similar to the Finnish Spitz and proved good at hunting. Later, other Russian breeders would import Finnish Spitzes for further crossings. The offspring fell into two classes - hunters would be rebred for hunting, and the non-hunters would be kept for show dogs. Whilst a popular breed of hunting dog in its home region, it is virtually unknown to the outside world and is not recognised as an independent breed by any kennel club. Since the renaming of the Karelo-Finnish Laika there has been a very slight divergence from the Finnish Spitz, whilst the Finnish Spitz is only solid red in colour, the Karelo-Finnish Laika can also be fawn or black and can have white markings on the head, chest, legs and tail. The breed has a very fox-like head, a heavy protective coat and a distinctive spitz curled tail, it is described as cheerful, energetic and always eager to please its human handlers. The breed is used by local hunters to hunt a variety of game including grouse, pheasant, duck, squirrel, hare, fox, marten and bear; it is said to be an extremely enthusiastic hunter capable of working in deep snow.

() was a car manufacturer located in the Jiangning District's Economic & Technological Development Zone in the city of Nanjing (People's Republic of China). The company was founded with an investment of 3 billion Yuan in April 1999 as a joint venture between Fiat Auto S.p.A. and the Nanjing Automobile Group. Around 30,000 up to 35,000 vehicles were manufactured annually for the Chinese market by Nanjing Fiat. History The production began in November 2001 with the Fiat Palio. It was followed by the Fiat Siena in September 2002 and the Fiat Palio Weekend and Fiat Dobl√≤ in June 2003. The production of the Fiat Perla was launched in July 2006. The Perla was the last model launched by Nanjing Fiat. Another model, the Fiat Linea, was developed by Nanjing Fiat in cooperation with Tofa≈ü A.≈û. and the Fiat do Brasil Ltda. The launch was scheduled for November 2006, but it never came because the Nanjing Automobile Group had forced to stop the car production until the end of the year, so the collaboration was officially terminated in order. In October 2006, Fiat had terminated their production in its Chinese facility. Nanjing Fiat was replaced by Roewe, the Chinese successor of the British Rover Group. Most of Nanjing Fiat's tooling was acquired by Zotye in 2008. Zotye started building the Fiat Multipla as the Zotye Mutiplan in 2009 and an updated version of the Palio/Siena as the Zotye Z200 in 2011. In July 2012, Fiat had founded a new Chinese joint venture.

The film's plot revolves around an American martial artist named Casey Bowman, who is asked by his sensei to travel to New York City and protect the Yoroi Bitsu, an armored chest that contains the weapons of the last K≈çga ninja. Ninja: Shadow of a Tear, a sequel to the film, made its premiere at the 2013 Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. Plot Casey Bowman is an American orphan who was adopted into a martial arts dojo in Japan. Because of his perseverance and desire to master bushido, he earns the respect of his sensei Takeda and his daughter Namiko. However, the dojo's top student Masazuka becomes bitter over Namiko's friendship with Casey. One morning, during a sparring match, he loses his temper and nearly kills Casey by throwing a katana at him. In self-defense, Casey scars Masazuka below his right eye. As a result of his actions, Masazuka is expelled from the dojo by sensei Takeda. Years later, Masazuka becomes a contract killer of an organization called Temple Industries, which itself runs an underground criminal cult known as \\"The Ring\\". He returns to his former dojo and claims the succession as soke, but sensei Takeda turns him down. Anticipating an invasion by Masazuka, sensei Takeda assigns Casey and Namiko to guard an old chest called the \\"Yoroi Bitsu\\", which contains the suit and weapons of an ancient ninja. Before Masazuka storms the dojo and murders sensei Takeda, Casey and Namiko manage to take the \\"Yoroi Bitsu\\" to New York City, where they keep it safe at Triborough University's vault with the help of sensei Takeda's friend, Professor Garrison. They are tracked down by Masazuka, who sends Temple's thugs to take down the couple. While Casey and Namiko are on the run, they are framed for the murder of Professor Garrison and arrested. During their interrogation, Casey is ridiculed by Detective Traxler. Masazuka, disguising himself as Namiko's lawyer, slips into the station and cuts the power. He takes down several police officers in the dark before incapacitating Namiko. In the midst of the chaos, Casey saves Traxler from being gunned down by Masazuka, who leaves with Namiko. After receiving a tip-off through a member of Temple's thugs, Casey storms Temple Industries, retrieving Masazuka's phone number from the firm's president. He calls Masazuka and sets up a meeting place to exchange the \\"Yoroi Bitsu\\" for Namiko's life. Casey then rushes to the university to retrieve the chest and don the ninja suit and the arsenal. At a construction site, Masazuka releases Namiko once the \\"Yoroi Bitsu\\" is lowered from a crane, only to discover the chest empty. The two men prepare for a final showdown, but members of The Ring stage an ambush under Temple's orders to kill the trio. Together, Casey, Namiko and Masazuka beat the thugs. Masazuka uses a blowgun to shoot a poison dart at Namiko and taunts Casey with the antidote bottle. Masazuka, however, drops the bottle, forcing Casey into a fit of rage. As an NYPD helicopter flashes its spotlight on the fight, Masazuka uses a ninjutsu technique to blind Casey with the reflections from his katana and disappears in front of him. Casey uses his instincts to counter-attack and impales Masazuka from behind. Casey is saddened that he is unable to save Namiko. However, upon remembering his sensei's teachings of a ninja's katana possessing the power to both kill and heal, he discovers the antidote inside the handle of his katana. Within seconds, the antidote neutralizes the poison as Namiko awakens. Before they leave, Casey decapitates Masazuka.

It is the northernmost Buddhist temple in Russia. History In 1909, Agvan Dorzhiev got permission from the Tsar to build a large and substantial Buddhist datsan or temple in Saint Petersburg which he hoped would become the residence of the first Buddhist ruler of Russia. However, the Russian Orthodox Church campaigned strongly against construction of this \\"pagan\\" temple across the country, which considerably delayed its construction. However, the first service was held on 21 February 1913, and construction was completed by 1915, when Tsar Nicholas II confirmed the arrival of a staff of nine lamas: three from Transbaikalia, four from Astrakhan Province, and two from Stavropol Province. The stained glass windows were commissioned from Nicholas Roerich. A second large service was held on 9 June 1914 to consecrate a large gilded copper statue of the sitting Buddha Shakyamuni, which was a gift from King Rama VI of Siam (Thailand), and a standing Buddha Maitreya, a gift from G. A. Planson of the Russian Council in Bangkok. The consecration of the datsan was held on 10 August 1915, when it was given the name of Gunzechoinei, or 'The source of the Buddha's Religious Teaching that has Deep Compassion for All Beings.'Ostrovskaya-Junior, Elena A. \\"Buddhism in Saint Petersburg.\\" After 1917, the building was ransacked and used for many purposes. It was briefly taken over and damaged by a Red Army detachment in 1919. Some repairs were carried out in 1922, major restoration was undertaken about 1926 but soon after there was a general persecution of Buddhism throughout the Buryat-Mongol Republic and the Kalmyk Autonomous Region, and monasteries were closed and their property including sacred books, altar ornaments, etc., seized, and lamas heavily repressed. The Leningrad temple, because of its foreign connection remained relatively immune for a while. In late 1933 the last Buddhist service was held at the temple in honour of the recently deceased Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama of Tibet, who had died 17 December 1933. By 1935 a large group of lamas was arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to 3 to 5 years hard labour. In 1937 the remaining Buddhists in the city were arrested and shot the same day.Andreev (1991), p. 221 The temple was spared from bombing during the Siege of Leningrad thanks to the lobbying by the Buddhist sympathizers within Ahnenerbe. In 1989 the Buddhist community in Saint Petersburg was officially recognised. That year a service was held by the Most Reverend Lama Kushok Bakula Rinpoche. That was the first service in 50 years. On 14 July 2004, the 150th birthday of Agvan Dorjiev was celebrated at the Buddhist temple in Saint Petersburg, a memory plate was unveiled, and a talk given by the American Buddhist scholar, Robert Thurman.Ocean of wisdom :: gallery As of 2013, the temple is actively maintained and a place of practice for scholars and students of the Tibetan Gelugpa school.

Biography He was probably born Jonas Joannis Michielsz in Hoorn.MICHA√ãLIUS (Jonas) in Van der Aa et al., Biographisch Woordenboek der Nederlanden He studied at the University of Leyden from 1600-1605, and worked as a clergyman in various towns in Brabant from 1607-1612, from 1612-14 in \\"Nieuwbokswoude\\" (modern Nibbixwoud), and from 1614-1624 in Hem. He married in 1614.MICHA√ãLIUS (Jonas) in the Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek In 1624 he traveled, presumably with the fleet of Piet Hein, to Salvador, Brazil, where he served until the town was recaptured by the Portuguese in May 1625. From there he crossed the Atlantic to Guinea where he stayed until 1627. After briefly returning to the Netherlands, he went to New Amsterdam in January 1628, and was thus the first minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in what would become the United States. He organized a consistory, and administered the sacraments, but returned to Holland in a few years, probably before the arrival of his successor, Everardus Bogardus, in 1633. Micha√´lius' wife died in New Amsterdam shortly after his arrival.Much of what we know about Michaelius is learned from a lengthy letter he wrote to a fellow-minister, Adrian Smoutius, quoted in full in both Dutch and English in Ecclesiastical Records, State of New York, Vol. 1, ed. Edward Tanjore Corwin. p.49ff. The classis of Amsterdam wished to send Micha√´lius back to America in 1637, but he did not return owing to political opposition from New Amsterdam.Narratives of New Netherland, 1609-1664, ed. J. Franklin Jameson. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1909. p. 120. It was long supposed that Bogardus was the first Reformed Church clergyman in the future United States, but the precedence of Micha√´lius was established by a letter from him to Adrian Smoutius, dated New Amsterdam, 11 August 1628, which was found in the late 19th century in the Dutch archives at The Hague. In this letter he describes the degraded state of the natives, and proposes to educate their children without trying to redeem the parents. The letter is printed in an appendix to Mary L.

Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Beatrice Allard was a fireballing right-hander, with a deceptive sidearm delivery, whose promising career was cut short by an injured shoulder after being forced to change her delivery. Born in Muskegon, Michigan, Allard learned to play sandlot ball with other neighborhood kids when she was a youngster. She became an avid fan of the Muskegon Lassies and did not miss a single one of the team's home games during their first three seasons in All American Girls Professional Baseball League. One day she decided to assist a tryout to help a friend catcher by tossing a few balls sidearm, gradually increasing the distance each time, even though she had no intention of playing in the league. But she had a fine throwing arm, and league's president Max Carey spotted her as a potential pitcher, so he signed her to a contract.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Allard joined the league in 1949 with her beloved Lassies. In the season opener in Muskegon, against the Kenosha Comets, she was called by team's manager Carson Bigbee to relieve in the top of the ninth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out. \\"The manager tossed me a ball and said 'Okay kid, see what you can do'\\", Allard explained in an interview. She struck out the first two batters and the third popped out to preserve the win and earn her a save. She was used again the next night, this time as a starter. \\"I pitched five good innings and was able to hit a triple first time up and a single later\\", she remembered.1949 Muskegon Lassies. Retrieved 2019-03-25. As the year progressed, Allard was going along fine until a sore arm midway through the season quickly dimmed her performance. They tried to change my delivery and I got all messed up, she said. I didn't complain, I didn't want to be a baby, she added. Allard finished the season with her arm in a sling and decided to go to a doctor, who told her that she had a dead arm and her playing days were over. After her baseball career ended, Allard joined the U.S. Army as a cryptographer and was stationed in San Francisco for three years. Afterwards, she returned to Michigan and worked in the Grand Rapids Employment Office for 31 years. In 1988, Allard became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual personality. It was not really a well known fact until filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her 1992 film A League of Their Own, which was a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL. Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty and Rosie O'Donnell, this film brought many of the real AAGPBL former players a rebirth of celebrity.

Commissioned in 1916 she was sunk in a friendly fire incident by the Q-ship Cymric in October 1918. Career Under her first commanding officer, Max Horton, J6 was launched on 9 September 1915 and commissioned on 25 January 1916. She and the other Js were members of the 11th Submarine Flotilla. She served in the North Sea chiefly in operations against German destroyers and U-boats. The closest she got to sinking the enemy was firing a torpedo at U-61 , but it missed its target. On 1 December 1917 Horton was replaced as commanding officer of J6 by Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Warburton. In April 1918, Warburton spotted the German High Seas Fleet which had put to sea in an attempt to hunt down an Allied convoy. Warburton did not identify the fleet as German and did not report his sighting to the Admiralty, had he done so it is possible that another full scale naval battle may have occurred. Loss On 15 October 1918 J6 was on patrol off the Northumberland coast when she was spotted by the Q-ship Cymric. The captain of the Cymric Lieutenant F Peterson RNR mistook the identity lettering on the conning tower of J6 for U6. Assuming U6 to indicate a German U-boat, Peterson raised the White ensign and opened fire on J6. After a number of direct hits, J6 sank. It was only after the survivors were seen in the water that Peterson and the crew of Cymric realised their mistake and recovered the survivors. Of the crew of J6 15 were lost; a subsequent court of enquiry found that no action should be taken against Peterson. Late in 2011 it was announced that divers had discovered her wreck off Seahouses. In the summer of 2013, the Polish Navy salvage ship ORP Lech, searching for the wreck of the Polish submarine ORP Orze≈Ç, surveyed and officially confirmed an identity of J6.

The election occurred in the middle of Democratic President Jimmy Carter's term. Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress. The Democrats lost three seats in the United States Senate to the Republican Party. Democrats won the nationwide popular vote for the House of Representatives by a margin of 8.9 percentage points, but lost fifteen seats to Republicans. The elections represent the most recent instance in which the president's party retained control of both houses of Congress in a mid-term election, although the 2002 elections saw Republicans retain the House and win control of the Senate. In the gubernatorial elections, Republicans picked up six seats. Among the newly elected governors was future president Bill Clinton from Arkansas. Clinton's eventual successor as president, George W. Bush, ran as the Republican nominee in Texas's 19th congressional district but was defeated by Democrat Kent Hance. Though Republicans gains were relatively modest for a midterm election, the election set the stage for the Reagan Revolution. Many of the newly elected members of Congress were more conservative than their predecessors, and most supported tax cuts that would eventually be implemented in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. The election also ended the possibility of a ratification of the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union. Carter's move to the center after this election encouraged a 1980 Democratic primary challenge by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy.

Their headquarters is located in Fairfield, Connecticut, United States. Save the Children USA was formed in 1932 to help children in the Appalachian mountains during the Great Depression, and modeled on the Save the Children Fund which had been established in Britain in 1919. Save the Children USA is part of the global Save the Children movement, with operations in over 120 countries around the world. Save the Children received a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator between 2001 and 2014, a 3-star rating between 2015 and 2017, and a 4-star rating in 2018. A National Report Card on Protecting Children During Disasters In 2008, when Save the Children conducted its initial review of disaster preparedness standards for child care facilities and K‚Äì12 schools in all 50 states, Louisiana met none of the standards. Louisiana has since revised its regulations to require that all regulated child care centers and homes have written disaster plans for evacuation and relocation and for parent-child reunification following a disaster as well as specific plans to meet the needs of children with disabilities and those with access and functional needs during emergencies. Louisiana joins a list of only 17 states that meet all four disaster preparedness standards. Controversies Sponsorship scandal (1998) In March 1998, Save the Children USA became embroiled in a scandal that was investigated by the Chicago Tribune. The investigation uncovered two dozen donors were making contributions to dead children. The scandal resulted in the dismissal of an employee that was based in Mali. Three additional employees were reprimanded for allowing these deaths to go unreported. An American family with the surname \\"Dixon\\" was sending $20/month to a child by the name of Abdoul Kone who died of a donkey cart accident nearly 3 years earlier. Mugs with traces of lead (1998) In October 1998, Save the Children USA recalled approximately 2,000 mugs when it was revealed that their lead content, while in compliance with Federal guidelines, exceeded the levels in a voluntary standard to be introduced in California the following year.

(Ed.) (2005). \\"Classification and nomenclator of gastropod families\\". Malacologia 47(1-2). . 397 pp. In 2009, John K. Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio proposed elevating the subfamily Conilithinae (previously placed in the family Conidae) to the rank of family. This was based on a cladistic analysis of anatomical characters, including the radular tooth, the morphology (i.e. shell characters), as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies, all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees. In their phylogeny, Tucker and Tenorio noted the close relationship of the various species within the genera in the Conilithidae; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by Puillandre et al..N. Puillandre, S. Samadi, M. Boesselier, A. Sysoev, Y. Kantor, C. Cruaud, A. Couloux, & P. Bouchett (2008), Starting to unravel the toxoglossan knot: molecular phylogeny of the \\"turrid\\" (Neogastropoda: Conoidea), Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 47:1122-1134. Tucker and Tenorio's proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies (and the other clades of Conoidean gastropods) is set forth at Tucker & Tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009. Like other species in the superfamily Conoidea, these snails are predatory and venomous, able to inject neurotoxins into their prey with their radula. The species in this family are capable of \\"stinging\\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. Genera Proposed genera within the Conilithidae include: *Bathyconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Californiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Conasprella Thiele, 1929 *Dalliconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Fusiconus da Motta, 1991 *Globiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Jaspidiconus Petuch, 2004 *Kohniconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Lilliconus Raybaudi Massilia, 1994 *Parviconus Cotton & Godfrey, 1932 *Perplexiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Profundiconus Kuroda, 1956 *Pseudoconorbis Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Quasiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Viminiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 *Ximeniconus Emerson & Old, 1962 *Yeddoconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 Significance of \\"alternative representation\\" Prior to 2009, all cone species were placed within the family Conidae and were placed in one genus, Conus. In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Recent published accounts of the family Conilithidae and its genera include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), Tucker & Stahlschmidt (2010), Tucker, Tenorio & Stahlschmidt (2011), Bouchet et al.

However, as of December 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

As of 2019, he is the President of PTI Punjab. Chaudhary was previously a member of Jamaat-e-Islami where he spent 35 years of his political career before leaving the party, by 2007 Chaudhary had joined Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. He has served as Imran Khan's chief political advisor, and served as the Punjab President of the party from 2013-15. After becoming Punjab President he serves on both the Central executive committee and Core committee (Politburo) Chaudhary is a former deputy mayor of Lahore. In 2018, he was a candidate for PTI in NA-133 (Lahore-XI) but lost to Muhammad Pervaiz Malik. Following the elections, he served as additional secretary general of PTI on a national level. He was again appointed to the position of President of PTI (Punjab) in 2019. Early life Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary was born in one of the Kamboh families of Lahore. He went to boarding school to Cadet College Kohat from where he did his Matriculation and F.Sc. He then did BSc in Civil Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology Lahore. Chaudhary is highly regarded by the Kamboh caste of Zamindars (traditional landowners) his popularity in local politics has helped elect PTI officials as MPA's in Lahore, specifically in PP-147 and PP-148 where those caste's form a majority. Personal life  Chaudhary married Salma Ejaz in 1984, his wife is the daughter of Mian Tufail Mohammad one of the original founding members and leader of Jamaat-e-Islami. Much of Chaudhary's early political career was in the Jamaat. Chaudhary is the founder and the chief executive officer of Kisan Care (pvt ltd) providing agricultural chemicals.  Political career Early career: Jamaat-e- Islami Chaudhary started his political career in the Jamaat-e-Islami student wing and had gradually progressed up the ranks of the party; he became national leader of the Jamaat student wing. Chaudhary and General Zia-ul-Haq were initially on good terms as Zia was keen to placate the religious right. However Chaudhary fast became disillusioned with Zia's undemocratic ways and as leader of the youth wing, Chaudhary dissented from the majority of the senior leadership as he opposed the regime of dictator General Zia-ul-Haq. Chaudhary organised protests in his native Lahore as national leader of the Jamaat's youth wing, General Zia soon ordered repression of the protests and Chaudhary along with his leaders and followers were tortured and imprisoned by the regime police and security services. The death of General Zia in 1988 breathed new life into Pakistan's faltering democracy; during this period Chaudhary served as deputy mayor of Lahore in the early 1990s. Chaudhary continued to rise in the party's ranks and by 1998 he was appointed to the Central Executive Committee (the top decision-making body of the party) Chaudhary continued to dissent in the 1990s from official party line on many cases; he voted against the Jamaat forming a coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League (N) for the 1999 elections while on the Central Executive Committee; however, the Jamaat formed an alliance; by this time Chaudhary had become disillusioned with the Jamaat as he felt that the party had lost its way in protecting the national interests of Pakistan, he left the party in 2006. Upon the death of Qazi Hussain Ahmed (the man who Chaudhary fell out with over his moderate approach compared to Ahmed's more conservative approach) it became evidently clear the two men had managed to reconcile their differences at some point while Chaudhary had still defected to PTI. Chaudhary's political views are frequently described as moderate, based on the principals of Islam and of communal tolerance. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf: 2007‚Äìpresent By September 2007, Chaudhary joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf after receiving a personal invitation from Khan himself to join the party. Since then has risen through the party's ranks serving as Punjab vice- president, chief political advisor, spokesperson on religious affairs and Punjab President. Then Vice-president Ejaz Chaudhary is on the right, Imran Khan (centre), on the left is Ahsan Rasheed (former Punjab President, Chaudhary defeated Rasheed in the 2013 intra-party elections) He served as the spokesperson for religious affairs, former central vice-president (Punjab) of the party, currently President of Punjab and is also currently responsible for organising PTI in southern parts of Punjab province. By mid-2012, Chaudhary's efforts had paid off and PTI became the dominant party in the southern parts of Punjab province, reflected in polls by International Republican Institute which showed the gap between PTI and PML-N had close significantly in Punjab, a direct result of the vice-president's efforts. By July 2012, the vice- president began to focus efforts in his native city of Lahore to ensure the gap between PTI and the other parties closes even more by the approaching general election. Chaudhary won the PTI intra-party elections, scoring victories in three out of four regions in Punjab province, electing him to the higher position of President of PTI in Punjab and his panel including Dr Yasmeen Rashid as general secretary in Punjab. On 2 February 2014, Chaudhary made it evidently clear that Imran Khan would not be negotiating for the Taliban in the peace process; he stated that Khan, himself and PTI were happy to facilitate the process but could not get involved directly because PTI did not have the constitutional legitimacy to lead the process, which was to be led by PML-N. He also stated that the Taliban should not require Imran Khan to negotiate on their behalf, but rather members of the Taliban should involve themselves because the peace talks were more likely to come to fruition. A bill against Domestic violence had been sent by Chaudhary to the Punjab assembly, which after pending a vote for 3 years was approved by the government and opposition. Chaudhary, along with Yasmin Rashid were instrumental in making PTI the first political party both in Pakistan and the sub-continent to have audited ISO-9000 certificates issued by an international firm, further bolstering the PTI's claim to be an anti-corruption party. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf: Past contributions Shortly after joining Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Chaudhary took charge of establishing the Insaf Students Federation (ISF). After successfully preparing the student youth wing structure in Pakistan's important universities, he supported the youth wing's position while Punjab president of PTI. Ejaz Chaudhary also co-founded the Kisan Insaf Mahaz (KAM) which servesas a platform for empowering the farmers' community in Pakistan, his role in Pakistan's agriculture reflected his family's heritage as well as his power as PTI leader in Punjab regions Following the scandal after an attempted assassination on Hamid Mir and the Geo-ISI rivalry, Ejaz Chaudhary challenged Geo's journalist Ifitkhar Ahmed to a debate over Geo's allegations against the ISI and on the role of rigging in elections. Iftikhar Ahmed has not responded to the challenge Chaudhary and fellow party ally Shah Mehmood Qureshi were influential in getting the PML-Q and the MWM (Pakistan's main Shia party) to support the PTI on a campaign against election rigging. Philanthropy In his early career Ejaz Chaudhary worked for the Jamaat-e-Islami charities in 1985 he was appointed head to the Majlis Khidmat e Islami (the main Jamaat-e-Islami) charity, they provided free medical aid, blood transfusion's and ambulance to the poor in Lahore also the charity helped to provide emergency relief to those who suffered from natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, furthermore Chaudhary has been vocally advocating for improved conditions in the Pakistani jail system, which is closely linked to the justice system. In August 2012 Chaudhary strongly condemned the attacks against Pakistan's Shia' community in Gilgit-Baltistan which killed 25 Shia Muslims.

He mainly devoted himself to landscape and portraits painting, as well as murals. He is one of the founders of Neorealism in Armenian art. Art critic Shahen Khachatrian referred to Melkonian as \\"an artist of the generation of the 1960s that provided a new impetus to the development of Armenian art. Reality is a characteristic feature of Ashot's art\\"., in Armenian, AZG daily. Honorary artist of Armenia Hakob Hakobian referring to Melkonian wrote \\"a brilliant composer of scenes, an author of exquisite portraits and landscapes, a master of gentlest and subtlest painting ... Melkonian is the pride of our painting school.\\" According to art critic L.S. Zinger (Moscow), Melkonian's art is \\"a mix of humanistic tradition and his Armenian outlook.\\"  Life and art education  Ashot Melkonian was born in Rostov-on-Don, USSR in 1930. He started modeling his artistic identity rather early. He grew up in Leninakan (nowadays Gyumri), Armenia, where his family moved in 1935 when he was 5. His mother, who was an artist and a teacher, taught him to love and understand music, and his uncle, who was a stage designer, introduced him to painting. During World War II, Melkonian studied in S. Merkurov art school and at the same time worked in the theater of Gyumri doing stage design. In those years, he greatly benefited from the powerful influence of Melikset Svakchyan, one of the most brilliant Armenian artists and stage designers. Thereafter in 1946 the young artist moved to Yerevan. He first attended P.Terlemezian Art College (1946‚Äì50) and then graduated from Yerevan Academy of Arts (1956). In those years, he became an ardent student of national cultural heritage and the world masters. Deep love towards the culture and music of his native people made him dedicate his diploma to Komitas. The painting, which depicts, against a scenic background, Komitas in the midst of boys and girls, immediately caught the eye with its rhythmical color scheme, harmonious composition and delicate hues. Ashot Melkonian was a member and in 1973 was elected to the board of the Union of Artists of Armenia. He was a lecturer of Fine arts in Yerevan State Pedagogical University. Ashot Melkonian was awarded the title of Honorary Artist of Armenia in 1977. In 1997, he moved to Fresno, California, where he participated in several exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York and Fresno. On December 9, 2009, he died of heart failure at Fresno at the age of 79, and is buried in the Armenian Masis Cemetery of Fresno. Art career Melkonian's early works with their subtle glow and wistful lyricism defined the scope of his interest and his admiration for things simple and unpretentious. He hears graceful and tender melody of scenes where a mother nurses her child, girls rest in stacks of hay carrying jugs of water, a youth plays a pipe, or boys admire a white stag by a stream. His \\"Family\\", painted somewhat later in 1967, amplified the most characteristic features of his art and epitomized his spiritual quest. This painting, central to Melkonian's art, is both a genre painting and a group portrait. The concentration of spirited faces, the harmony of silver-blue hues create a soft introspective ambiance. The trees and the flowers in the painting are viewed as symbols of tenderness that unite the family. The \\"Family\\" came as a proof of Melkonian's artistic maturity. Its most characteristic features are the precise simplicity of drawing, the richness of substance and bold statement of values adopted by the new school of Armenian painting that emerged in the 1960s. \\"Boy with a book\\" painted in 1970, a small portrait, followed the tone set by the artist in his \\"Family\\". The artist once more arrests the viewer's attention with the ambiance of the painting, taking him to the world of youth, communicating its spirit and inviting to listen to the melody of the human soul. Along with individual features of his models, Melkonian's paintings reflect grasp and relate all that is essentially human and universal. These portraits are simple in composition, melodic in lines and delicate in hues. The artist easily communicates with his models and, most importantly, creates an emotionally charged and captivating mood that gets hold of the viewer. In 2008 the album of Ashot Melkonian's art collection was published in Aleppo., in Armenian  Portraits  \\"Armen\\" portrait made in 1972 presents an honest, straightforward and wistful youth. The lyrical character of the model is sharply yet tenderly revealed. The charm of the youth is in his palpably dignified pose, arresting confidence and open gaze. Melkonian's portraits start with an impression inspired by the model. Then comes the second stage, where the model does not have to be physically present. As the artist draws the features of the face, he explores and refines the idea of the portrait and finds the hues that would best reflect his idea and render its substance and meaning. The image gains the unique features of the model and at the same time serves to implicitly affirm the author's aesthetic, moral and civil stance. Only such portraits are valuable and important for the artist.  Landscapes  Melkonian uses the same approach when working on his thematic paintings and landscapes. A finished work is preceded by numerous sketches, used to bring the perfection that is in the artist's eye. The vibrant layer of hues and meticulous attention to detail charged the paintings with depth, emotion and wistful substance.  Murals  Parallel to his painting, Melkonian also created beautiful murals in Yerevan, Echmiadzin and Gyumri. The motive and rationale are the same, a man and his inner world. In 1969, on the occasion of Komitas' 100th anniversary, the dome of Echmiadzin seminary (then Museum) was painted with murals, a series of scenes depicting the themes of Komitas' songs. The idea belonged to Ashot Melkonian. His co-workers were Hakob Hakobian, Henrik Siravian and Rafayel Sargsyan. Melkonian's art is pure, lucid and lyrical. The large mural still captures with its simplicity, purity, loftiness and harmony of hues and lines. Exhibitions *From 1957 to 1978, participated in various national and international exhibitions in Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Prague and Korea. *In 1975, participated in an exhibition \\"Sarian and 13 Armenian Artists\\" in Bologna and Bari, Italy. *In 1976, participated in the exhibition of Armenian Artists in Buenos Aires. *In 1977‚Äì78, participated in \\"Soviet Armenia\\" exhibition in Denmark and an exhibition of contemporary Armenian art in Lisbon. *From 1980 to 1987, participated in several international exhibitions, including 5th International Biennale in Kosice, Czechoslovakia, exhibition of Armenian Art in Moscow and Leningrad, 4th International Triennal of Contemporary portrait in Radom, Poland.

Built in 1927, it was added to the register in 1989. It was the last of numerous Portland firehouses to be designed by fire chief and architect Lee Gray Holden, who died of a stroke while visiting the No. 7 firehouse in 1943. The building continued to be used by the city's Fire Department until the 1980s, when it was sold off and used as an automobile garage. It was acquired by a local developer in 2009, and was restored and remodeled for office and retail use. Architecture Exterior The building is located at 1036 SE Stark Street in the Buckman neighborhood of southeast Portland. It comprises two main elements--the original 1927 masonry firehouse, and an adjacent wood-faced garage constructed to the east in 1964. The firehouse and garage together have a footprint of approximately by , of which the masonry building contributes roughly . The exterior features of the masonry firehouse include a gable roof, a central gable dormer with a multi- pane oval window, skylights, and a red brick chimney. The firehouse, which has a full basement, rests on a concrete foundation. Two bays with garage doors and one bay with windows dominate the north face of the ground floor. Three second-floor bays match the first-floor bays, except that all have windows instead of doors. Two more doors open into the firehouse at the south end of the east fa√ßade. Many of the windows on both floors are paired. The 1.5-story addition east of the firehouse originally housed a mechanic's garage, but the addition is not included in the historic registry listing. Interior The original structure was divided into office, dormitory, and vehicle areas. The first floor was used mainly for parking and servicing fire trucks and other vehicles, but included space for a handball court with an electronic scoreboard. Fire department staff lived on the second floor, with some personnel--presumably the chief and other senior staff--maintaining their own separate quarters. History Fire Station No. 7 is associated with Lee Gray Holden (1865‚Äì1943), a nationally renowned designer of firehouses. Built in 1927, the station was intended to serve as a state-of-the-art facility to house the fire department's headquarters on Portland's East Side. It originally housed the headquarters' administrative and service functions, and was used as the service center for East Side fire vehicles. The building was the largest and last of the 24 firehouses designed by Holden, who served as battalion chief for the southeast sector of the city. It followed a semi- standardised layout that he had devised for his firehouses, with dormitories above the first-floor working space. Eleven of his firehouses still stand, of which No. 7 is the largest. In 1943, Holden died of a stroke while visiting the building. The fire department continued to use the building for many years after Holden's death. It was expanded in the 1970s, and was used as a repair center and garage for the entire department until it was sold off in the 1980s. It was subsequently used as an automotive garage, before being abandoned in the late 2000s. Much of the interior is still intact; surviving features include the original partitioning walls and booths resembling telephone boxes which enclose the firemen's poles. The scoreboard and other fixtures of the handball court are also still in place. In 2009, Portland developer Venerable Development and partners acquired the property with a plan to renovate it and turn it into modern offices and retail space. The project incorporated both the original masonry building and the 1960s garage next door. The work, which took place between August 2009 and March 2010 at a cost of $3.8 million, restored the masonry building's exterior appearance to its historical condition and preserved the surviving interior fittings. The non- historical south-facing roll-up garage doors have been replaced with historically-accurate carriage doors, based on period photographs. The building is now used by small office and retail businesses. The adjoining garage extension, which is not part of the protected historic property, has undergone more drastic changes in the course of its redevelopment for use as the headquarters of Bremik Construction. The original plywood facade has been replaced with a new masonry and storefront system, while its interior tongue- and-groove fir siding has been restored, and an expanded mezzanine has been constructed.

Gateway to Knowledge, Vol. 1. North Atlantic Books. p. 23.Herbert V. Guenther & Leslie S. Kawamura, Mind in Buddhist Psychology: A Translation of Ye-shes rgyal-mtshan's \\"The Necklace of Clear Understanding\\" Dharma Publishing. Kindle Edition. (Kindle Locations 386-392). CetanƒÅ is identified within the Buddhist teachings as follows: * One of the seven universal mental factors in the Theravada Abhidharma. * One of the Ten mahƒÅ-bh≈´mika in Sarvastivada Abhidharma. * One of the five universal mental factors in the Mahayana Abhidharma * The most significant mental factor involved in the creation of karma. Definitions Theravada Bhikkhu Bodhi states: : Cetana...is the mental factor that is concerned with the actualization of a goal, that is, the conative or volitional aspect of cognition. Thus it is rendered volition. The Commentaries explain that cetana organizes its associated mental factors in acting upon the object. Its characteristic is the state of willing, its function is to accumulate (kamma), and its manifestation is coordination. Its proximate cause is the associated states. Just as a chief pupil recites his own lesson and also makes the other pupils recite their own lessons, so when volition starts to work on its object, it sets the associated states to do their tasks as well. Volition is the most significant mental factor in generating kamma, since it is volition that determines the ethical quality of the action.Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), p. 80 The AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (I, Part IV, Chapter I, 111) states that cetanƒÅ has the characteristic of coordinating the associated dhammas (citta and the other cetasikas) on the object and that its function is 'willing'. We read: : ...There is no such thing as volition in the four planes of existence without the characteristic of coordinating; all volition has it. But the function of 'willing' is only in moral (kusala) and immoral (akusala) states...It has directing as manifestation. It arises directing associated states, like the chief disciple, the chief carpenter, etc. who fulfil their own and others' duties.Gorkom (2010), Definition of volition Mahayana Geshe Tashi Tsering states: :Intention [...] is also called volition. This is the element that coordinates and directs the activity of each of the other elements within the main mind in respect to the object. Once feeling is present, intention moves our mind in a certain direction. :Intention is the factor that actualizes what feeling has initiated. If the feeling generated upon contact with an object is attraction, intention moves the mind forward toward the object. For example, I smell a ripe mango in a shop I am passing, and the feeling of attraction arises. Intention is the shift in the mental process toward buying it. The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is cetanƒÅ? It is a mental activity that propels the mind forward. It has the function of making the mind settle on what is positive, negative, or indeterminate. Herbert Guenther explains: : It is a mental event that arouses and urges the mind with its corresponding events on towards an object. From among all mental events, it is said to be the most important because the force of this mental event sets the mind and any mental event on to the object. Just as iron cannot but be attracted by a magnet, so also the mind cannot be but set on an object by this mental event. Alexander Berzin states: : An urge (sems-pa) causes the mental activity to face an object or to go in its direction. In general, it moves a mental continuum to cognitively take an object. A mental continuum (sems-rgyud, mind-stream) is an individual everlasting sequence of moments of mental activity.Berzin (2006) Mipham Rinpoche states: : Cetana describes the process of mind [attention] moving towards and becoming involved with an object. In terms of support, there are six, such as cetana upon meeting of the eye [i.e. between object, sense faculty and consciousness], and so forth. CetanƒÅ operates with six supports, or along six channels: # CetanƒÅ occurring in visual situations # CetanƒÅ occurring in auditory situations # CetanƒÅ occurring in olfactory situations # CetanƒÅ occurring in gustatory situations # CetanƒÅ occurring in tactile situations # CetanƒÅ occurring in thought situations Relation to karma In the Buddhist tradition, cetana is considered the most important mental factor in the generation of karma. Bhikkhu Bodhi states (from the Theravada point of view): :Volition is the most significant mental factor in generating kamma, since it is volition that determines the ethical quality of the action. Alexander Berzin explains (from the Mahayana point of view): : [According to Asanga's] view, karma (Tibetan: las) is a mental impulse. It is synonymous with the mental factor of an urge (Tibetan: sems-pa). An urge is a mental factor that accompanies every moment of our experience. It is the mental factor that brings us in the direction of a particular experience, either simply to look at or to listen to something, or, in this case, to do something with or to it, to say it, or to think it. Whether it is physical, verbal, or mental karma, the karmic impulse is the mental factor of an urge to do, say, or think something. It is like the impulse to hit someone, to tell the truth, or to think longing thoughts about a loved one. It is also the mental urge to continue doing, saying, or thinking something, as well as the mental urge to stop engaging in them and to do, say, or think about something else. Usually, we are not at all aware of these mental urges or impulses. In Western terminology, we would say they are usually \\"unconscious.\\"Berzin (2008) Alternate translations * Attraction (Erik Pema Kunsang) * Directionality of mind (Herbert Guenther) * Urge (Alexander Berzin) * Volition (Bikkhu Bodhi) See also * Karma in Buddhism * Mental factors (Buddhism) References Sources * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Berzin, Alexander (2008), Clearing Away Extraneous Conceptions about Karma * Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, Pariyatti Publishing  Guenther, Herbert V. & Leslie S.

She was a close aide of J. Jayalalithaa, the late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, who headed the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) from 1989 until her death in 2016. After Jayalalithaa's death, the party's general council elected her as the secretary general of AIADMK. She is the aunt of T.T.V. Dhinakaran, general secretary of AMMK. She was arrested along with Jayalalithaa on 7 December 1996 and was remanded to judicial custody for 30 days in connection with the Colour TV scam. During Jayalalithaa's three tenures as Chief Minister, Sasikala was alleged to have laundered huge amounts of wealth amassed by Jayalalitha. On 14 February 2017, a two-bench Supreme Court jury pronounced her guilty and ordered her immediate arrest in a disproportionate-assets case, effectively ending her chief ministerial ambitions.  Early life  Sasikala was born in a Tamil family from Thiruthuraipoondi who later moved to Mannargudi. Her marriage to M. Natarajan was presided over by DMK leader M. Karunanidhi. Her husband, was a public relations officer in the Government of Tamil Nadu, who worked closely with the District Collector of Cuddalore, V. S. Chandralekha, who in turn was very close to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran. This helped Sasikala in gaining the friendship of Jayalalithaa and shaped her further life.  Career   Meeting with Jayalalithaa  In the early 1980s, through V. S. Chandralekha, who was then the District Collector of South Arcot, and a friend of M.Natarajan, Sasikala gained acquaintance with Jayalalithaa, who was then the Propaganda Secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Since Sasikala helped in video coverage of party meetings and distribution of policies of AIADMK through CD's, Sasikala and Jayalalithaa gradually became very close.  Temporary expulsion from AIADMK  On 19 December 2011, Jayalalithaa expelled Sasikala Natarajan and 13 others including Sasikala's husband M. Natarajan, T. T. V. Dhinakaran, their relatives, and Jayalalithaa's foster son V. N. Sudhakaran from the AIADMK. This act of Jayalalithaa was considered a way to prove that she was not under the influence of Sasikala and her family. The matter was resolved by 31 March 2012, when Sasikala Natarajan was reinstated as a party member after issuing a written apology.  General Secretary of AIADMK  In a meeting held on 29 December 2016 ‚Äì the first meeting after Jayalalithaa's death on 5 December 2016 ‚Äì the AIADMK general council appointed Sasikala as the party's general secretary.  Chief Minister Elect of Tamil Nadu  On 5 February 2017, Sasikala was unanimously elected as the AIADMK Legislature Party Leader by a meeting of all the MLAs in the party. Tamil Nadu Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao accepted the resignation of Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on 6 February 2017, and instructed him to continue to function as acting Chief Minister \\"until alternate arrangements are made\\". The Governor delayed announcing VK Sasikala as the new Chief Minister, waiting for the verdict of the misappropriation case on her. On February 14, 2017, VK Sasikala was convicted and sentenced to 4 years sentence in Bangalore Parapana Jail and gave her 24 hours to surrender. The governor, then rejected her claims to become Chief Minister. VK Sasikala then convened the party's MLA council in her capacity as the General Secretary. There, Mr. Edpappadi K. Palaniasamy was unanimously elected as the new Chief Minister and he was sworn in the next day.  Expulsion  On August 21, 2017, Sasikala was expelled from the AIADMK and removed from her post of General Secretary. Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam The expulsion of Sasikala and her family led to the new party Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam._ T. T. V. Dhinakaran was appointed as the general secretary and Sasikala became the president of Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam.  Conviction  On 14 February 2017, the Supreme Court of India found Sasikala and her co-accused ‚Äî Ilavarasi (her sister-in- law) and V. N. Sudhakaran (her nephew) ‚Äî guilty of conspiring, laundering and amassing illicit wealth worth about in the 1990s in a criminal conspiracy with Jayalalithaa. The three were sentenced to a four-year jail term. This restored in toto her earlier conviction in the case delivered on 27 September 2014, sentencing a four-year jail term to her and her relatives, in addition to imposing a fine of each. The judgment stipulated that she and her accomplices would serve an additional 12 months in prison if they failed to pay the fine. The Supreme Court refused her plea to surrender after a fortnight and to be allowed to have food from home, so Sasikala and Ilavarasi presented themselves for imprisonment on 15 February 2017.  In media  Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has announced that he is planning a film covering Sasikala's early life and the things she did to gain entry into Tamil Nadu politics.

In the 1980s he changed his style into a form of abstract expressionism influenced by Native American and tribal cultures as well as outsider art. Drawing inspiration from outsider and tribal art, Havard stands within a tradition that includes such notable artists as Paul Gauguin, Cy Twombly, Jean Dubuffet, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Joseph Beuys.Sasse, James Havard, 3, 24-25.  Life and work  James Pinkney Havard was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1937. He received a bachelor of science degree in art from Sam Houston State College (now Sam Houston State University) in Huntsville, Texas, in 1959. From 1961 to 1965 he studied at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he was influenced by realist painters Ben Kamihira and Hobson Pittman. His career can be divided into three broad periods: realism (1960s), abstract illusionism (1970s), and abstract expressionism with tribal and outsider influences (1980s and beyond). ‚ÄúHis early work was . . . realistic and traditional, including landscapes, churches, and figuration much in the same styles as Camille Corot, √âdouard Manet, and Edgar Degas.‚ÄùSasse, James Havard, 9. Beginning in 1967, he broke away from realism and went through a period of experimentation with various abstract and contemporary styles (e.g., monochromatic paintings).Sasse, James Havard, 10-11. By the late 1970s Havard was considered one of the founders of abstract illusionism along with Al Held, Jack Lembeck, John Clem Clarke, George D. Green, and Tony King. His work during this period is characterized by pastel colors, ‚Äúoptical illusions and combinations of gesso wipes, chalk scrawls, incised lines, and squirts of paint directly from the tube.‚ÄùSasse, James Havard, 13. In 1976, one art critic wrote of his paintings, \\"Though conveived to fool the eye, Havard's paintings are at once daring and subtle, complex in scheme and simplistic in symbolic reference.\\"Janet Kutner, Arts Magazine 51, no. 2 (Oct. 1976), 9. He moved to New York in 1977 and took frequent trips to Santa Fe, New Mexico, beginning in 1978. In New York, his color palette darkened and his works became richer in texture. He began including Native American images and Native American words (e.g., mimbres) inscribed in loose script as well as random numbers.Sasse, James Havard, 16. During the 1980s Havard‚Äôs paintings began to include thicker layers of paint, more collage elements, and fewer squiggles of paint and optical illusions. He moved to Santa Fe in 1989 where he continued to develop his style, ultimately freeing himself from all references to abstract illusionism. His later paintings have fewer overt tribal references and are smaller in size than many of his earlier pieces. One critic accused Havard's paintings of \\"display[ing] the female body with what comes off as a misogynistic vigor.\\"Arlene McKanic, \\"The Figure 2001,\\" ARTnews 101, no. 3 (Mar. 2002),121-122. Havard began to use an encaustic medium that allowed him to incise the surface of the painting which gave them a carved, luminous appearance.Sasse, James Havard, 24. His palette varies from dark, rich, and contrasting colors to bright blues and reds. Rich textures and visually arresting but crudely rendered figures define his work. Many of his paintings seem visually dense. One collector of Havard's paintings remembered his initial uniformed response to them: \\"What a mixed up mess these are.\\"Norman Kolpas, \\"Expert Guidance,\\" Southwest Art 29, no. 3 (Aug. 1999), 77). In 2006 Havard suffered a stroke but continues to paint.http://www.artltdmag.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id;=1247005854&archive;=&start;_from=&ucat;=18& This well-trained artist who for many years was inspired by outsider art has become an outsider himself in the sense that he now paints with the constraints of a physical handicap. Due to Havard's limited mobility, his most recent works are small in scale, but \\"are nonetheless extremely powerful, perhaps even more so because the reduced format concentrates them.\\"http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2016/09/james-havard-paintings/ Havard's work is in the permanent collection of many museums around the world, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York), Smithsonian Institution (Washington, D.C.), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Museum of Modern Art (Stockholm, Sweden), Tucson Museum of Art (Arizona), and the Los Angeles County Museum (California).Sasse, James Havard, 232. Havard has been married three times: Charlotte Lisle (1958‚Äì61), Elizabeth Corson Beardsley (1965‚Äì74), and Catherine Bruni (1985‚Äì89). He has two children, Inga Renee Havard (b. 1960) and Houston James Havard (b. 1985), from his first and third marriages respectively.  Selected bibliography  * Sasse, Julie. James Havard.

As of 2017, the current Director of Archives is Mr. Danjuma Dambring Fer.  History  Professor Kenneth Onwuka Dike did a survey of Nigerian public records from 1951 to 1953. Based on what was found, he made a recommendation to have a public record office. This led to the founding of the Nigerian Record Office on April 1, 1954. In 1957, the Public Archives Ordinance No. 43 was enacted and became effective on November 14, 1957. It changed the name of the archives to become the National Archives of Nigeria.

Plot In 1641 the pirate captain Jeremy Flynn and his crew are sailing around Tortuga when the compass breaks. Drifting off course they reach the pirate Redberd's base on Devil's Island where they get attacked. Redbeard's men kidnap the crew and take all valuables while Flynn manages to hide from them. It is now up to him to rescue his crew, get back his treasures and escape Devil's Island. Gameplay Flynn in the Skull-Grotto stage. The player takes the role of Jeremy Flynn, who is controlled using a joystick and the keyboard. The joystick is used for movement (running, jumping, ducking, crawling), using the primary weapon (a dagger at first), operating switches/levers and carrying boxes. Additionally a parachute can be deployed for slowing down descent as larger falls can kill Flynn. The weapon does not work while in the air and is replaced by a ground-stomp used to destroy breakable blocks. The keyboard's arrow keys are used to navigate through Flynn's inventory while the Space key uses/activates the selected inventory item. The Escape key kills Flynn in case the player fell into a trap he/she can't escape from through other means. Flynn starts with a life meter of five units (which can be extended) and three extra lives. Touching enemies, enemy projectiles or environmental hazards (poison, spikes) will reduce the life meter depending on the specific enemy. When the life meter reaches zero Flynn will lose a life, the game ends when the last life is lost. The game has four stages and the player will be given a password between each of them which can be used to continue a game after shutting it off or losing all of the lives. However, the password only provides level access and does not save any score or other inventory items. The life meter can be filled by picking up potions or buying food. Additionally Flynn can pick up fruit from defeated enemies and pots which fill a \\"Vitamins\\" gauge which, when full, is reset to zero and rewards one life point. During the game Flynn can pick up treasure such as silver/gold coins and money bags. They are found in treasure chests, dropped by enemies, lying in the open or in secret coin-collection bonus stages (which are started by hitting a hidden block with the head). The stages contain shops where the player can use the gold to purchase a variety of items, including stronger weapons (with more power and/or better range), food to restore health, an item to extend the life meter and bombs to blow up walls. The player can also find parts of treasure maps. When six parts are collected a bonus game starts where gems must be collected. At the end of the stage the player receives gold depending on how many gems were picked up and also at least one additional extra life.

The runic text directly refers to an estate held in an allodial title. Description The inscription on U 130 consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on a serpent that forms a circle. A cross is in the center of the inscription. The inscription, which is on a rock-face and is 1.9 meters tall by 1.54 meters wide, is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond- shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. This stone is considered to be a \\"good example\\" of an inscription in style Pr4. p. 123. Based upon stylistic analysis, the inscricption has been attributed to a runemaster with the normalized name of √Ösmund K√•resson. √Ösmund was active in the first half of the 11th century in Uppland. The runic text states that the inscription was a memorial sponsored by a man named Bj√¥rn in memory of his brother √ìleifr, who died as a result of some form of betrayal. The brother's death took place in Finnhei√∞r or Finnveden, which is a former district in Sm√•land. Other runestones that mention Finnveden include Sm 35 in Repl√∂sa and Sm 52 in Forsheda allm√§nning. p. 35. U 130 is also a public record which resolves the legal issue of the inheritance of a farm located in Elgjasta√∞ir or the modern village of √Ñlgesta in Husby-√Ñrlinghundra parish, which the text states was held through an allodial title by Bj√¥rn as the family inheritance from his father Finnvi√∞r. Under an allodial right, a member of a family had first rights to purchase a farm, and if the farm was sold to a stranger a family member could within a certain number of years redeem the property at the original sale price plus the cost of any improvements. It has been suggested that the inscription at Nora means that the two brothers owned two farms, one at Nora and the other thirty kilometers north at √Ñlgesta. pp. 279-280. The runes suno on the stone, which translate as \\"sons at,\\" follow the rule that double letters are represented with only a single letter, even if one of the two letters are at the end of one word and the second is at the beginning of the next word. The transliteration of the runic text for these words, suno o, shows word divisions and a separate o-rune for each of the two words. The inscription is known locally as the Norah√§llen. Bj√¥rn, the sponsor of U 130, would later raise another runestone, U 433 which was found at the church in Husby-√Ñrlinghundra, in memory of himself.

By the Golden Bull of 1356 he was acknowledged as Elector of Saxony and Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire. Life Rudolf was the eldest son of the Saxon duke Albert II (c. 1250 ‚Äì 1298), who initially ruled jointly with his brother John I but gradually concentrated on the Ascanian Saxe-Wittenberg territory. Rudolf's father consolidated his position by marrying the Habsburg princess Agnes (1257‚Äì1322), a daughter of King Rudolf I of Germany, whom he had elected King of the Romans in 1273. Upon the death of Margrave Henry III of Meissen in 1288, Duke Albert II applied at his father-in-law King Rudolf for the enfeoffment of his son and heir with the Saxon County palatine on the Unstrut river, which ensued a long lasting dispute with the eager clan of the Wettin dynasty. Albert's attempts to secure the succession in the lands of the extinct Saxon counts of Brehna were more successful: when their fiefs were reverted to the Empire in 1290, the king enfeoffed Albert's son Rudolf . After Rudolf of Habsburg had died, Duke Albert II on 27 April 1292 wielded the Saxon electoral vote, electing Adolf of Nassau. In 1295 he could again enlarge his Saxon territories, when he acquired the County of Gommern. In 1296 the Ascanian lands were finally divided into the duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Lauenburg. Upon King Adolf's deposition and death in 1298, Albert II again exercised the Saxon electoral dignity by voting for his brother-in-law Albert I of Habsburg. Accession Still a minor when his father died on 25 August 1298, Rudolf I succeeded as Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg under the tutelage of his mother Agnes of Habsburg acting as guardian and regent. She gradually introduced him to the business of government at the court of her brother, King Albert I, in preparation for his role as ruling duke. Rudolf's first official act as holder of the electoral dignity of the Imperial Archmarshal (Archimarescallus) was the consent to King Albert's request to enfeoff the duchies of Austria and Styria to Albert's sons Rudolf III, Frederick the Fair and Leopold. When in February 1300, King Albert I tried to grant his eldest son Rudolf sole possession of Austria, the ecclesiastical prince-electors refused and a military conflict erupted. Young Rudolf of Saxe-Wittenberg, however, was not involved in this conflict; he remained under the care of his mother until 1302. Imperial election of 1308: the Seven Electors voting for Henry, Rudolf (3rd from right) wielding the Saxon vote (Codex Balduini Trevirorum, c. 1340) In 1302, Rudolf finally assumed the rule over Saxe-Wittenberg himself. Initially, he was anxious to further strengthen the country's sovereignty. To achieve this, he first of all had to make his Saxe-Lauenburg relatives, John II, Eric I, and Albert III agree that he, and not his eldest cousin John II, had inherited his father's rank as Saxon elector. Of great importance was Rudolf's vote in the Imperial election of 1308, upon the assassination of his uncle Albert I of Habsburg. After some time of back and forth negotiations, Count Henry of Luxembourg was elected on 27 November 1308. Duke Rudolf I voted for Henry and also assisted him by providing money and troops, earning him the goodwill of the newly elected emperor. Double election of 1314 Nevertheless, Henry of Luxembourg died on 23 August 1313 and the next election of the King of the Romans was held on 19 October 1314 in Sachsenhausen near Frankfurt. For the first time, two candidates in the election claimed to have won it, the Wittelsbach duke Louis the Bavarian and Rudolf's Habsburg cousin Frederick the Fair. Louis had received five of the seven votes, to wit that of Duke John II of Saxe-Lauenburg, rivallingly claiming the Saxon electoral dignity, Archbishop Baldwin of Trier, the legitimate King John of Bohemia, Archbishop Peter of Mainz, and the Ascanian margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg. Rudolf's preferred candidate, the anti-king Frederick the Fair, received in the same election four of the seven votes, one each from the deposed King Henry of Bohemia, thereby illegitimately assuming electoral power, Archbishop Henry II of Cologne, Louis's brother Count Palatine Rudolf of Bavaria, and Rudolf I himself, also claiming the Saxon electoral power. The two kings met in the Battle of M√ºhldorf on 28 September 1322; Louis of Bavaria emerged victoriously as the German king, he was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. As a supporter of the Habsburg side, Rudolf I had to face the consequences: when in 1320, the Ascanian rulers of Brandenburg became extinct with the death of Margrave Henry the Younger, Rudolf I, who had administered Brandenburg as regent since 1319, claimed the margraviate as an Ascanian fief. King Louis, however, held that he could not grant the fief to an elector who had voted against him, and gave it to his own son, Louis V, to strengthen his dynasty's position. With the Margraviate of Brandenburg, Louis V also received the electoral vote and the post of an Imperial arch-chamberlain. Imperial politics Dynastic domains in the Holy Roman Empire 1273‚Äì1378 After these and other sanctions by the Wittelsbach emperor, Duke Rudolf I decided to subordinate himself and his brother Wenceslas to Louis for tactical reasons and attempted to prove himself as a true support. From then on, he acted as mediator in the ongoing disputes between various princes, which allowed him to build up useful connections. For example, he organised a meeting between six of the prince-electors promulgating the constitutional Declaration of Rhense in 1338. Rudolf, on the other hand, had a friendly relationship with Pope Benedict XII, who had declared the emperor excommunicated. Thereafter, Louis finally changed his opinion of Rudolf and leased parts of the March of Lusatia, including the cities of Brietz, F√ºrstenwalde and Beeskow to him for a 12-year period. Under his mother's influence, he began the expulsion of Jews from Wittenberg, which continued until the middle of the 14th century. Rudolf also outlawed the Slavic languages originally spoken in his territory. He founded the All Saints' Monastery in Wittenberg, from which the later All Saints' Church evolved. Around 1340, he built Wittenberg Castle as a suitable residence for himself and his descendants. In the 16th century, his Wettin successor Frederick III constructed a Renaissance castle on the foundations of Rudolf's castle. To cover the increasing cost of his Imperial policies, he began to sell rights, such as market rights, coinage rights, low justice, customs and escort rights. These rights were the roots of the first communal structures in the Wittenberg area. In 1306, he organised defensive and offensive alliances with several cities; the cities expanded these alliances in subsequent years. Charles IV During his mediations, Rudolf also built up a close relationship with the Bohemian court in Prague, which became apparent with the election of King John's son and heir, the Luxembourg prince Charles IV (1316-1378) as King of the Romans on 11 July 1346. Charles was crowned in Bonn on 26 November 1346, and Duke Rudolf I was the only elector who was present at this solemn ceremony. His close ties to Charles IV were rewarded when he received the Altmark territory in 1347, whereby the Elbe river became the boundary between Saxony and Brandenburg. In addition, he received the Imperial Forestry at Frankfurt an der Oder in 1348, as compensation for his expenses as elector. Under his direction, the Mecklenburg lords John I and Albert II became Dukes and Imperial Princes. However, his relation with Charles deteriorated when in 1350 Charles confirmed the Wittelsbach margrave Louis V as Elector of Brandenburg and Margrave of Lusatia. This confirmation aroused Rudolf's indignation and he temporarily withdrew from the Prague court. Both reconciled after Charles IV gave Rudolf the Walchenhof Court in the Mal√° Strana district of Prague. Rudolf's greatest success came on 4 October 1355 when the emperor drafted the Golden Bull, the bulla aurea Saxonica, defining the future law of the Empire. This bull stipulated primogeniture for all electorates: they were declared indivisible; the eldest son inherits the entire principality, or, if an elector has no sons, an elector's younger brother inherits. A prince-elector could cast his vote from the age of 18 and rule the electorate from the age of 21. The Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg was confirmed as the Elector of Saxony. In return, the Saxe-Lauenburg branch of the House of Ascania finally lost all claims to the electoral vote and to the associated dignity of Imperial Archmarshal as well as the right to carry a sword in the imperial diet. Rudolf I died on 12 March 1356 in Wittenberg and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son Duke Rudolf II (c. 1307 ‚Äì 1370). He was initially buried in the Wittenberg Franciscan Church; in 1883, his mortal remains were transferred to the All Saints' Church. The Saxe-Wittenberg branch of the Ascanian dynasty became extinct with the death of Rudolf's grandson Duke Albert III in 1412, whereafter the Wittenberg estates and the Saxon electoral dignity passed to the Wettin margraves of Meissen.  Marriage and issue  Electoral arms of the dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg Rudolf I married three times: In 1298 he married Margravine Jutta (Brigitte) of Brandenburg (died: 9 May 1328 in Wittenberg), a daughter of Margrave Otto V of Brandenburg. They had the following children: # Albert (died young, on 4 July 1329) # John (died young, in Wittenberg) # Anna (mentioned in 1309 ‚Äì died in Wittenberg in 1328 or 1329), married Bernard of Poland (died ) # Rudolf II ( - 6 December 1370), married Countess Elizabeth of Lindow and Ruppin # Elisabeth (died 1353), married before 22 June 1344 with Prince Waldemar I of Anhalt-Zerbst (died 3 September 1367) # Agnes (died 4 January 1338), married Prince Bernhard III of Anhalt-Bernburg ( - 20 August 1348) # Otto (died 30 March 1350), married Elizabeth of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (d. 1384), a daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and Hedwig of Ravensberg; their son was Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of L√ºneburg # Beatrix (died in the Coswig Convent, after 26 February 1345), married on 27 January 1337 to Prince Albert II of Anhalt-Zerbst (1306 - 1362) Rudolf married Kunigunde of Poland on 28 August 1328 ( - 9 April 1333 in Wittenberg), the daughter of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high of Poland and Hedwig of Kalisz.

Life and work Thomas Treadwell Stone was born on February 9, 1801 in Waterford, Maine to Solomon Stone and Hepzibah Treadwell Stone. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Treadwell, served with the Minutemen and was at the battle of Bunker Hill with Colonel William Prescott's regiment.Thomas T. Stone, Letter to his Brother, August 23, 1894, Bolton, Massachusetts Historical Society At that time Waterford was an area of new and sparsely populated farmland, and Solomon Stone made his living as a farmer. Thomas attended Bridgton Academy and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1820. Early Career and Marriage Thomas married Laura Elizabeth Poor in January 1825 in Andover, Maine . Laura's brother Henry Varnum Poor was a financial analyst and founder of H.V. and H.W. Poor Co., which later evolved into the financial research and analysis bellwether, Standard & Poor's. Thomas and Laura's marriage produced 7 sons (Thomas, Walter, Henry, Lincoln, Alfred, George, and William) and five daughters (two Lauras, Mary, Martha, and Elizabeth). After studying theology and performing missionary work in Oxford County, Maine, he was ordained in at the Orthodox Congregational Church in Andover, a traditional Congregational church. In this most northwesterly town then organized in Maine, he served under a Dr. Tappan from 1824 to 1830.National Cyclopedia of American Biography, V. 2 (New York, NY, James T. White, 1921) From 1830 to 1832 he headed Bridgton Academy in Maine.Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, v.5 (New York. NY. Appleton and Company, 1866). Among his students was John Albion Andrew, the radical abolitionist, who would become Governor of Massachusetts during the Civil War years. Formation of Anti-slavery sentiment From 1832 to 1846 Stone and his family resided in East Machias, Maine, where he was pastor of the Union Church. As seen by his writing and lectures during this time, Stone became an early convert to abolitionism. As early as the 1830s Thomas Stone was exhorting his congregation that slavery was a national problem. \\"It was the duty of all Christians\\", according to Stone, \\"to do our utmost in resisting [slavery], through the Spirit of Christ.\\"Lou Falkner Williams, introduction to \\"Bitter Freedom: William Stone's Record of Service in the Freedmen's Bureau,\\" edited by Suzanne Stone Johnson and Robert Allison Johnson (2008),p. xiii. East Machias was home to many intellectuals at that time, and his church members included many who later took on theological leadership positions in New England educational institutions. Among them were Samuel Harris (President of Bowdoin College and Professor of Theology at Yale Divinity School), Roswell Dwight Hitchcock (President, Union Theological Seminary), Ezra Abbott (Harvard Divinity School), George Harris (Andover Theological School), and Arlo Bates (professor at MIT).George Williis Cooke. A Theoretical and Biographical Introduction to Accompany \\"The Dial\\", (Cleveland, 1902 Reprint, Bolton Historical Society), 89. Stone lectured for the Massachusetts England Anti-slavery Society, and was a delegate to the 1839 annual meeting of that group. His sermon The Martyr of Freedom, a discourse delivered at East Machias, in 1837, condemned the killing of Elijah Lovejoy, Stone's friend and an anti-slavery publisher in Illinois. Lovejoy was a Presbyterian minister editing anti-slavery newspapers in Missouri until his presses were destroyed by mobs. Lovejoy was killed during an attempt to burn his office in Alton, Illinois. In his sermon Stone urged his listeners to \\"proclaim the truth of slavery, not only to peers, but to the slaveholder.\\" Slavery, he stated, not only destroys those who witness truth but the nation and slaveholder as well.Thomas T. Stone, The Martyr of Freedom (Boston, Isaac Knapp, 1838), 22-28. These strong abolitionist viewpoints led to Stone's ousting as a Congregationalist minister in 1844. In 1846 he moved his family from Maine to Massachusetts to become pastor of the First Church of Salem (Massachusetts, Unitarian), where he served until 1852.First Church In Salem website, http://www.firstchurchinsalem.org/ministers-23.html, retrieved Mar 2012 During this time he was able to build his anti-slavery fervor, as evidenced by frequent visits by the elite of the movement, including Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Greenleaf Whittier, William Lloyd Garrison, and Wendell Phillips.George Williis Cooke. A Theoretical and Biographical Introduction to Accompany \\"The Dial\\", (Cleveland, 1902 Reprint, Bolton Historical Society), 91. Reactions among many New Englanders to the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was mixed, but to those who opposed slavery it was fierce. Discontent among Stone's parishioners at First Church in Salem rose as he became more involved with the fugitive slave issue. In August 1851, Stone was formally terminated. His fate was similar to other New England theologians, many who resigned or were dismissed for supporting the anti-slavery cause. In December 1851 Stone addressed the Salem Female Anti- Slavery Society in Salem, of which his wife, Laura Poor Stone, was a member (an abolition quilt she created there is owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.Salem Women's History website, http://www.salemwomenshistory.com/First_Church_in_Salem.html, retrieved Mar 2012). During this last recorded public address, he emphasized that slavery was irreconcilable with man being created in God's image, and urged his listeners to know the effects of slavery and pray for its end. During this speech he acknowledged the sadness and pains suffered by the anti-slavery community by being rejected, denounced and ridiculed by friends, family and church, and thanked them for standing firm for the cause. Stone and his family moved to Bolton, Massachusetts in November, 1852 where he became the 7th minister of the First Parish of Bolton.Bolton Center Historic Neighborhood Blog, http://boltoncenter.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/street-of-stories/, retrieved Mar 2012 Transcendentalism Thomas Treadwell Stone, though lesser-known than the other New England Transcendentalists, \\"had religious, literary, and reform connections to nearly all of the major Transcendentalists and contributed to the DIAL magazine in the early 1840s.\\"Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism, by Tiffany K.

Family and Civil War years In 1859 Thomas and his wife Laura moved to Brooklyn, Connecticut and became pastor of the Unitarian Universalist Church there in 1860. The Civil War's anti-slavery theme must have given hope and courage to Stone. Four of his sons enlisted in the Army of the Potomac, three at the outset and one later. His son William was wounded at Antietam in September 1862, and again at Gettysburg in 1863 as part of the Nineteenth Massachusetts. William had obvious abolitionist fervor as well, as he was appointed to the Freedmen's Bureau in March 1866, \\"probably because of his whole-hearted commitment to black rights\\".Williams, ibid., p. xvii William also served briefly as the Attorney General for South Carolina. Thomas's son Lincoln Ripley Stone, was a Surgeon in the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Infantry (the first black regiment). He later practiced medicine in Newton, Massachusetts. Son George Herbert Stone served as a Private in Co. I, 38th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and died in service in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1863. Son Henry served as 2d Lieutenant in the 1st Wisconsin Volunteers, and later as Lieutenant Colonel of the 100th U. S. Colored Troops. His son Alfred was a noted architect in Providence, RI. Final years In 1866 Stone received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Bowdoin, his Alma Mater. During his later years he preached and gave lyceum lectures occasionally.National Cyclopedia and Appleton's Cyclopedia. Stone returned to Bolton in 1871 where he spent his final years writing.

The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Fusiconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is fusiform in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral, the spire is scalariform. The anal notch is deep. The early and middle spire whorl are ornamented with a single cord. The body whorl is conspicuously ornamented with has evenly spaced cords or sulci that continue the entire length.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Fusiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones.

Construction of the first section started in 1856, and the 37-house terrace was complete in the early 1860s. Architecturally, the houses divide into five separate compositions, although all are in a similar late Regency/Italianate style. This was characteristic of houses of that era in Brighton, and especially in the Montpelier area‚Äîwhere the Regency style persisted much later than elsewhere. Standing opposite is the landmark Montpelier Crescent, which had a view of the South Downs until Vernon Terrace blocked it. Three groups of houses in the terrace have been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for their architectural and historical importance. History Brighton (originally known as Brighthelmston) developed as a large fishing and agricultural village on the English Channel coast. Despite intermittent periods of decline and destitution, it was the largest town in the county of Sussex by 1600. In the mid-18th century, the damaging economic effects of a terminal decline in the fishing industry were reversed by the new fashion for sea-bathing, and the town's new role as a seaside resort began.Berry, Sue (1988): Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography, in Northwest of the old town, around the parish church and the road leading to Devil's Dyke and on to London, was an expanse of gently sloping downland known as Church Hill. It was given over to sheep-grazing and was owned by two prominent locals: MP Thomas Kemp and John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. The flat-fronted numbers 1‚Äì6 are the oldest part of Vernon Terrace. The bow-fronted houses at 7‚Äì16 Vernon Terrace were finished in 1857. Helped by royal patronage (particularly from the Prince Regent) and good transport links to London and other important towns, Brighton grew rapidly in the early 19th century, and high-class suburbs were laid out. The completion in 1841 of the main railway line from London provided a further stimulus.Berry, Sue (1988): Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography, in By this time, Church Hill‚Äîideally situated close to the sea and the town's main attractions, largely undeveloped and with a pleasant southwesterly aspect‚Äîwas developing as a high-class residential area called Montpelier. Montpelier Road was laid out from 1820 as a major road running from the seafront to the Ditchling Road, past the house built in 1819 for the late Thomas Kemp's son Thomas Read Kemp‚Äîwho had become the main landowner in the area by inheriting his father's land. Just north of Kemp's house was a large nursery and market garden owned by Parsons and Sons, described at the time as \\"well-known florists on the Western Road\\". The gardens were opposite Montpelier Crescent, a South Downs-facing development built between 1843 and 1847. In 1856, a trade directory stated that 16 houses had been built on the west side of the former Montpelier Road, which by that time had been renamed along most of its length: the stretch opposite Montpelier Crescent had been called Vernon Terrace. Not all houses had residents at that stage, and four were in use as schools: numbers 7, 13, 15 and 16. (Mid 19th-century Brighton was well known for its large number of educational establishments, especially boarding schools: it was sometimes nicknamed \\"School Town\\".) The terrace was added to in the early 1860s when more houses were built to the north as far as the junction with Goldsmid Road, where a slightly older house (now numbered as 37 Vernon Terrace) already stood. This junction was remodelled in the late 19th century and became Seven Dials, a major roundabout where seven roads meet. By 1876, when the area was mapped by the Ordnance Survey, almost all of the formerly agricultural land of Church Hill had been built upon; but some fields remained immediately behind Vernon Terrace. This was filled in during the 1890s when the Edwardian-style red-brick houses of Vernon Gardens were built. Notable residents of Vernon Terrace have included Eleanor Marx, daughter of Karl Marx, who lived at number 6 during the 1870s. By the early 21st century, all of the houses had become multiple-occupancy flats, but their modest front gardens survive. Heritage 37 Vernon Terrace stands next to Seven Dials. Three parts of Vernon Terrace have been listed at Grade II by English Heritage. This status is awarded to \\"nationally important\\" buildings of \\"special interest\\"; as of February 2001 they made up three of 1,124 such buildings in the city. Numbers 1‚Äì6 and 7‚Äì16 were listed on 20 August 1971; number 37, at the north end of the terrace, was listed on 26 August 1999. Numbers 17 to 36 inclusive are not listed. Vernon Terrace forms part of the Montpelier & Clifton Hill Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This area was designated by the council in 1973. Brighton & Hove City Council's report on the area's character states that Vernon Terrace is \\"an imposing terrace of houses\\" which together with Montpelier Crescent \\"form[s] a townscape of outstanding quality\\". Vernon Terrace is immediately opposite the crescent; its construction meant that Montpelier Crescent's previously uninterrupted views of the South Downs were permanently blocked. Architecture The houses at the south end of the terrace (1‚Äì6) date from between 1856 and 1857, and those at numbers 7‚Äì16 are contemporary. Numbers 1, 6 and 7‚Äì16 rise to four storeys; the other houses have only three. All are stucco-clad and have cast iron balconies at first- floor level. The end house, number 1, has a two-window range and an entrance in Windlesham Avenue (with a three-storey canted bay window next to it. Numbers 2‚Äì6 each have three windows to each storey, but other differences include the detailing of the entrance porches: there are various combinations of single or double entablatures, pilasters, architraves and rustication, and the placement of the porches also varies. Continuous rustication spans all six ground-floor walls, though. Some windows are set in moulded architraves with pediments of various designs. A cornice runs above the top floor, but is not continuous and changes in style from flat to modillion. At numbers 7‚Äì16, standard features include straight-headed entrance porches, ground-floor rustication, three windows to each storey, many set in architraves with decorative moulding, and a continuous cornice and parapet. Number 8 has extra balconies at second- and third-floor level. The unlisted houses at 17‚Äì36 have simple canted fa√ßades with sash windows. They date from the 1860s. At the north end, 37 Vernon Terrace is an older house (dating from 1850 or earlier) which was incorporated into the terrace. The main five-window fa√ßade is on Vernon Terrace, but there are two other elevations facing Seven Dials and Goldsmid Road; these have a canted bay window and architrave-framed windows respectively. The centrally placed entrance is set in an elaborate doorcase with pilasters, an entablature and a Doric frieze with triglyphs. All windows contain original sashes, and those to the first floor are set in architraves. The two bays to the left of the entrance form a full-height bow. Included in the English Heritage listing are the garden walls with a continuous balustrade and square piers at intervals.

He is known for his one-man show, Oscar Remembered, which tells the story of the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde as seen from the perspective of his lover and nemesis, Lord Alfred Douglas. Mazumdar is the founder of the Phoenix Theatre in Montreal, Quebec, as well as the Provincial Drama Academy and the Stephenville Theatre Festival in Stephenville, Newfoundland. Early life Maxim Mazumdar was born 27 January 1952 to Millicent and Dr. Mark Mazumdar, a dentist. He grew up in their family home at Charni Road, Mumbai, India. He attended Campion School in Mumbai. During this time, he had roles in several school productions, including Apsalom, Ordeal by Battle, and Oliver Twist, where he played the role of Fagin. In 1969, upon the death of his father, Mazumdar immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, along with his mother and brother, Malcolm. Mazumdar enrolled in Loyola College (now part of Concordia University) in Montreal and graduated in 1972, with a BA degree in Communication Arts. Career Towards the end of his last year at Loyola, Mazumdar joined Janet Barkhouse, Jordan Deitcher and Sharron Wall in founding Raven Productions, which over a period of two years presented Shakespeare, Wilde, Coward and Beckett in both traditional venues and as \\"Salon Theatre\\" around Montreal. Their 1973 production of Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, in which Mazumdar played Martha as a man, gained international notoriety after its closing by the author was written about in the New York Times and elsewhere. Later, Mazumdar co-founded the now-defunct Phoenix Theatre in Montreal. The theatre was intended for English productions. While at Phoenix, he directed and acted in his own works, as well as works by No√´l Coward. It was while at Phoenix, that he wrote Oscar Remembered, a two- act play that examined the friendship between Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas. He performed his monologue across the US and Canada, including at the Stratford Festival. After leaving the Phoenix Theatre, he continued to write and direct his own plays, including Rimbaud and Dance for Gods. His works explored various aspects of gay history. In 1979, while adjudicating at the Newfoundland and Labrador Drama Festival, Mazumdar was impressed with the quality of the local productions and decided to establish the Provincial Drama Academy in Stephenville, Newfoundland, offering theatre training to local youth. That same year, he established the Stephenville Theatre Festival with the aim of bringing a professional theatre experience to the people in western Newfoundland. The Stephenville Theatre Festival was the first professional theatre festival in Newfoundland and Labrador. Over the next nine years, Mazumdar served as artistic director to the festival. During this time, he led the production of several performances in collaboration with director Edmund MacLean and executive producer Cheryl Stagg. Notable productions included Macbeth, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Man Who Came To Dinner, and Cyrano de Bergerac. Mazumdar united once again with director Jordan Deitcher for two shows in New York City, playing King Lear in Raven's 1984 production at the Park Royal Theatre, and writing and appearing in the 1985 Off-Broadway world premiere of The Bentley Variations (aka Unholy Trinity), a cabaret about the role and treatment of the visionary in society, based on the works of Eric Bentley.  Death  Mazumdar died of AIDS in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 28 April 1988. Following his death, his play, Oscar Remembered, was revived at Stratford in 2000. In Mazumdar's honour, the Alleyway Theatre in Buffalo, New York grants the annual Maxim Mazumdar New Play Competition Award, in remembrance of his contributions to the early growth of Alleyway.

Our instincts have not had time to adapt to the rapid changes of modern life. The book takes its title from Nikolaas Tinbergen's concept in animal ethology of the supernormal stimulus, the phenomena by which insects, birds, and fish in his experiments could be lured by a dummy object which exaggerated one or more characteristic of the natural stimulus object such as giant brilliant blue plaster eggs which birds preferred to sit on in preference to their own.

Built between 1870 and 1874, the buildings have been the meeting place for both chambers of Parliament since 16 June 1874, and a former site of Colonial administration of Barbados. It consists of two buildings in the neo-Gothic architectural style, and are reminiscent of the Victorian era of Great Britain. The buildings are situated along the north bank of the Constitution River and are bordered by Upper Broad Street and National Heroes Square to the south; strategically at the heart of the capital city Bridgetown. Prior to the establishment of the buildings the legislature met at the Town Hall building on Coleridge Street. In 1989 the Public Buildings were officially renamed the Parliament Buildings by Act of Parliament. In 2011 both buildings were designated as UNESCO protected properties within the World Heritage Site of Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison area.  History  Although Parliament was established in 1639, these buildings which house the Parliament were only constructed in the late 19th century. The reason behind the erection of these buildings was twofold. Firstly, there was the need to find a safe place to store the island's public records, which prior to the construction of the Parliament buildings, were stored in various government offices located around Bridgetown. Secondly, the island's legislature needed an appropriate place to convene. From the establishment of the House of Assembly in 1639 to the erection of the Parliament buildings, the legislature shifted from building to building around Bridgetown, and at several instances it actually met at taverns and alehouses. This of course was frowned upon by many of the island's previous Governors, several of whom proposed that money be voted for the erection of an appropriate building to house Parliament.Historic Bridgetown, Warren Alleyne, 2003 Several plans were made for the erection of a building for Parliament. In 1701 a house was constructed within James Fort, but it was later used as the island's Common Gaol. In 1844, there were plans to erect a Sessions House but these plans were later abandoned when a great fire in Bridgetown allowed Government to find a more suitable site. In 1857 John Glasglow Grant, a member of the House of Assembly, tabled a motion for the erection of the public buildings. A Public Buildings Erection Committee was appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly whose members included Grant. The committee proposed that not only should the buildings house Parliament but also the Custom House, the Marshal's Office, the Post Office and the Prothonotary's Office.  Construction  The construction of the buildings was met with several delays. However, in 1860 there was yet another fire in Bridgetown, the Government decided to purchase the land which they believed would be an even better site than the one upon which they had previously agreed. After requesting and unanimously accepting the design of John F. Bourne, the then Superintendent of Public Works, the Committee invited tenders for the construction of the west building. The Assembly decided on the tender of ¬£13,750 submitted by a Mr Benjamin L. Harris. Construction of the west building was completed in late 1871 and was presented to the Government at the beginning of 1872. Although Mr Harris had also presented a tender for the East building to the tune of ¬£15,750, the Assembly accepted the tender of Mr Richard F. Roberts for ¬£11,750. The east wing was handed over to Government two years later.  East wing  The east-wing of the Parliament of Barbados, completed in 1873. The East Wing was completed in late 1873. It still houses the Chambers and offices of the once Legislative Council (now the Senate) and the House of Assembly. The Attorney-General, Solicitor-General and the Chief Parliamentary Council also had offices there. Several offices were located on the ground floor of the East Wing at various periods. These included: *The Public Library *The Public Work's Department *The Master-in-Chancery (later known as the Registrar) *The Legal Draftsman (later known as Chief Parliamentary Counsel) *The Income Tax Department *The Post Office *some offices of the Central Bank The east wing has undergone several renovations: In 1970 the East Wing was extended to facilitate a separate entrance to the Public gallery of the House of Assembly from the courtyard; in 1977 a mezzanine floor was then constructed in the central area of the East Wing; in 1986 the chamber of the House of Assembly was comprehensively renovated, starting on 7 May. A separate mezzanine floor was established for the Public Gallery. A sound and vision system was also installed. New furniture, made exclusively of Barbadian mahogany wood was also heralded. The stained glass windows to the chamber were also re-leaded and otherwise restored. The walls (formerly plastered) were stripped and grouted and otherwise restored to display their natural sawn Barbadian limestone look. New lighting was also upgraded using the purely decorative original gas chandeliers which are still in place; in September 1988 renovations of the Senate Chamber commenced using the same applications as in the work for the House of Assembly, except the ceiling was aesthetically restored to its original finish; also in 1988 the ground floor of the East Wing was fully renovated to allow for the whole east wing to be available for parliamentary purposes. Notable features: The stained glass windows in the House of Assembly show the British sovereigns spanning from James I to Queen Victoria. The glass windows within the Senate show the armorial bearings not only of past Presidents of the Council but also past Speakers of the House of Assembly.  West wing  The west-wing of the Parliament of Barbados, completed in 1872. The West Wing was finished in 1872 and over the centuries has accommodated several principal public offices: *The Colonial Secretary *The Government Savings Bank *The Colonial Treasurer *The Auditor-General *The Accountant-General *The Postmaster-General *The Comptroller of Customs *The Provost Marshal *The Director of Education Also located there were the offices of the first elected Ministers (there were 5 in all) from 1954. During late 1885 to 1886 the clock and bells of the tower once found in the East Wing were relocated to the West Wing. (See more about the clock further down the page.) On the main stairways of this wing, one can also see two stained glass windows which bear the Biblical quote \\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's...\\". () In November 2006 the West Wing of Parliament was refurbished to mark the island's 40th year of Independence. Among other things, the newly refurbished West wing houses a National Heroes Gallery as well as a Museum of Parliament. A ceremony was held to commemorate the reopening of the west wing and was attended by dignitaries as well as the general public.  Notable features of the Parliament Buildings  In addition to its beautiful architecture, the Parliament buildings have several notable architectural features. The green colour cast iron railing surrounding the courtyard of the Parliament Buildings was made by a British firm called Messrs Andrew Handyside & Co. Ltd. Another notable feature of the building itself is many of the windows of the buildings have louvreed shutters for blocking out direct-sun light. During the months of November and December the city of Bridgetown has an annual national lighting ceremony. During this time the Parliament Buildings are often elaborately illuminated in the colours of the National Flag (in November) or Green/Red for Christmas (by the middle of December).  The Clock tower  Parliament illuminated at night A prominent feature of the coral-limestone structures is the clock tower attached to the west-wing. The Tower located in the west wing can be seen from several vantage points around Bridgetown and is complemented by a four faced clock on each side. The Barbadian flag flying triumphantly on top of it. However, the clock tower was not always located in the west wing. A clock tower with a peal of bells was previously attached to the east-wing where both the Senate and House of Assembly chambers are located,Public buildings, Bridgetown, Barbados 1879-80, The Royal Collection Trust however poor soil conditions destabilised the clock-tower's base causing it to begin sinking. Within ten years of its construction, the clock tower had sunk by ten feet into the ground. The tower was dismantled in 1884 and a clock tower was later constructed at the west wing where it stands today. The clock was designed and manufactured by John Moore & Sons of Great Britain (1875). It was designed to run for 8 days and is designed to continue operating even when being wound. In 2010 the clock was damaged during Tropical Storm Tomas causing the hands to become ceased on 2:12. Smith of Derby Group, England was contracted to refurbish the clock.

He was the creator and host of The Magic of Oil Painting (1974‚Äì82) television series that ran on PBS in the United States. He co-wrote The Art of Bill Alexander and ‚Ä¶ (1987‚Äì95), a series of books on wet-on-wet oil painting, based on different PBS series of the same form. He also taught the television painter Bob Ross his signature \\"quick\\" wet-on-wet technique. Early life Wilhelm Alexander was born in East Prussia (in what is now Poland). His family fled to Berlin during World War I. Career Apprenticed as a carriage maker, Alexander was drafted into the Wehrmacht during World War II. Captured by Allied troops, he painted portraits of Allied officers' wives and he soon made his way to the United States. After World War II, Alexander was a refugee and became a professional painter. He pioneered the modern \\"quick\\" version of the 15th century wet-on-wet technique, and moving to North America. Later, known as Bill Alexander, he began hosting television shows focused on painting education and his methods. He is best known for the television program The Magic of Oil Painting which ran on PBS in the US from 1974 to 1982. He teamed with other artists on several different PBS series of the format The Art of Bill Alexander and ‚Ä¶ that ran from 1984 to 1992. These artists started with Lowell Speers and included Robert Warren, Sharon Perkins and Diane Andr√©. Alexander and the second featured artist would alternate episodes, with both painters using the wet-on-wet method. This series was turned into a series of books \\"as seen on television\\". Relations with Bob Ross TV host and prolific painter Bob Ross studied under Alexander, from whom he learned his wet-on-wet technique, a method of painting rapidly using progressively thinner layers of oil paint. Ross mentioned in the very first episode of the The Joy of Painting that he had learned the technique from Bill Alexander, calling it \\"the most fantastic way to paint that you've ever seen\\". Ross also dedicated the first episode of the second season to Alexander, explaining that \\"I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you [the viewer]\\". As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained. In a 1991 interview with The New York Times, Alexander said of Ross, \\"He betrayed me. I invented 'wet on wet'. I trained him, and he is copying me -- what bothers me is not just that he betrayed me, but that he thinks he can do it better.\\" Alexander refers here to the fact that Bob Ross used some of his individual patter like \\"happy little trees\\" and borrowed some of his unique peculiarities. Art historians have pointed out that the \\"wet-on-wet\\" (or alla prima) technique actually originated in Flanders during the 15th century, and was used by Frans Hals, Diego Vel√°zquez, Caravaggio, Paul Cezanne, John Singer Sargent, and Claude Monet, among many others. But actually, Alexander invented the step of priming the canvas with a liquid white paint (before starting to paint) and he also designed the style of palette knife employed, which is larger, firmer, and has one straight edge. Both inventions are fundamental for his wet-on-wet technique.

It can be seen from nearby U.S. Route 101 and is \\"Healdsburg's abiding structural symbol\\". Description The Healdsburg Memorial Bridge is a Pennsylvania (Petit) truss bridge. This once-popular design, named for the Pennsylvania Railroad, has since fallen out of favor. The Healdsburg bridge is one of only two bridges of this design still carrying vehicle traffic in California, and one of only 13 in the United States. The bridge has two truss spans, each with ten panels. The entire bridge is long; the longer of its two spans is long. Its deck is wide, with a vertical clearance of ; because its narrow deck does not meet modern safety standards, it is classified as functionally obsolete.. The bridge carries 7400 vehicles/day on Healdsburg Avenue (a local road in Healdsburg) as well as pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The east end of the bridge lies in Healdsburg Veterans Memorial Beach Park;. another truss bridge carrying a railroad line crosses the river nearby to the north and also ends within the same park. History The point on the river now used by the bridge was used as a ford by settlers to Sonoma County since the 1850s. The memorial bridge was built in 1921 by the American Bridge Company to carry the historic Redwood Highway; when built it was the only steel bridge across the Russian River. At that time an annual temporary dam built downriver from the bridge created a swimming area; the same part of the river still remains popular for swimming. When U.S. Route 101 was built, on a new alignment crossing the river farther to the west, most of the traffic formerly carried by the memorial bridge was diverted. The original bridge design included decorative lights, which were removed in the 1950s. A structural report in 1979 showed the bridge as being near collapse.How We Got Here ‚Äì 1921-2007, healdsburgmemorialbridge.com, accessed 2011-12-26. The land containing the bridge was annexed by Healdsburg in 1980. In 1985, the bridge was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, despite which the Healdsburg city government began planning to replace it in 1990. After negative reaction from the community, no action was taken. In 2000 the city again made plans for the bridge, involving a seismic retrofit. In 2007, errors in the 1979 report were discovered, and a new report in 2008 showed that the bridge remained structurally sound. It was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 2011, and in December 2011, state and federal funding for restoration was approved, contingent on the city providing funds for ongoing maintenance of the bridge. The retrofitting and restoration was completed in 2015. The work involved construction of a new mid-river pier, installation of isolation bearings, reinforcement of truss members, and replacement of the deck.

Stretching close to 2 miles long and bringing between 250,000 and 300,000 attendees in a single day, it has been called the oldest and largest street festival in the San Francisco Bay Area and the \\"world's biggest block party\\". In 2001, The Library of Congress's American Folklife Center in Washington, D.C. designated the festival as a \\"National Local Legacy\\". History The Solano Stroll began in 1974 by the Thousand Oaks Merchant Association, a small business guild started by Ira Klein and co-headed by Lisa Burnham. Klein owned and managed \\"The Iris\\", a Solano clothing and jewelry store formerly based on Shattuck Avenue that sold dress goods made primarily by local fashion designers, among the earliest including Laurel Burch. Lisa Burnham (n√©e Liesel Hirsch), an Austrian national and Holocaust survivor, owned \\"Northumbrian Antiques\\", an interior design business on Solano from the 1950s to the 1970s. Klein conceived the festival as both a \\"thank you party\\" to customers and to promote the avenue's family-owned business community. According to a Patch.com interview with son Gabe Klein, the elder Klein's three creative influences included his childhood in New York City, the culture of Telegraph Avenue while he attended UC Berkeley in the 1960s, and his maternal cousin, George Schindler, a noted magician and film actor. Klein had been involved with the fair's planning, promotion and organizing until closing his business in 1998. Event organizer Lisa Bullwinkel directed the event for 16 years, from 1989-2005. Burnham died in 2001 in Berkeley, and Klein in 2007 in Springfield, Oregon. Current Citizens for East Shore Parks president and former Albany mayor Robert Cheasty, a civil attorney who runs a law firm on the avenue, is a ranking organizer of the Solano Stroll, being involved with the festival since 1984 and having served as the Solano Avenue Association's (SAA) president from 1989 to 1991. The first festival began on a Friday evening and included only the Thousand Oaks Berkeley portion of Solano Avenue before expanding to Albany a few years later and switching to Sunday. By this time, the \\"Thousand Oaks Merchant's Association\\" would become the \\"Solano Avenue Association\\". Initially an after-hours reception for local businesses, the fair would include attractions such as magician booths, live bands, street theatre, jugglers and fire eaters by the late 1970s. Although the event has always been funded by Solano businesses, larger sponsors have included Safeway, Andronico's, Mechanic's Bank, BART as well as the city governments of Albany and Berkeley. The Solano Stroll Parade and grand marshals The Solano Stroll begins with an 8am breakfast served at Memorial Park, near Albany High School, before the fair's parade begins at the Eastern end of Solano Avenue in Berkeley at 10am. Since the 1980s, a grand marshal has been chosen to head the parades; previous leaders have included Buffalo Bob Smith (of 1950's NBC television show Howdy Doody) in 1996, 1972 Olympian and sports writer Craig Van Collie in 1998, sixties counterculture icon Wavy Gravy in 2000, and former Noah's Bagels CEO/founder Noal Alper in 2010, whose namesake deli still has a location on Solano Avenue. In addition to city politicians and personnel, the parade also includes marching bands and cheerleaders from high schools across the Bay Area and various performance artists or dance troupes. Festival After the parade closes, the street opens to pedestrians and remains closed to traffic until 6pm. Various forms of entertainment include taiko, belly dancing, karate tournaments, vintage car shows, puppet shows, clowns, stilt walkers, improvisational theater, magicians, face painting, dunk tanks, fun houses and most recently amusement rides. Music Local music groups, in addition to school bands, perform songs during the festival. Styles have included jazz, folk rock, alternative rock, Klezmer, Scottish folk dance, bluegrass, hip hop, R&B;, soul, zydeco, roots rock and tribute/cover. Famous past acts at the Solano Stroll have included The Uptones, Operation Ivy, Rancid and Pirahna (during the 1980s); and bands (or creative members of) Blue √ñyster Cult, Blind Illusion, Heathen, Alphabet Soup, Primus, The Charlie Hunter Trio, Furthur, RatDog and Country Joe and the Fish during the 1990s and 2000s (decade). From the late 1980s onward, band selection has been conducted via a jury process and fee decided by SAA members. In 2000, Country Joe McDonald said of the fair: Cuisine Over 50 food vendors have booths at the festival, most selling carnival- related American fare like corn dogs, pizza, deep fried pastries and cotton candy, but also more international choices like Thai, Cambodian, Caribbean barbecue, Latin American, Middle Eastern kebab and falafel pitas. Chez Panisse owner Alice Waters, pioneer of the slow food movement, was recognized during the 2000 Solano Stroll's \\"Local Legacies on Parade.\\" Political and financial issues Although the Solano Stroll continues the original objective of celebrating local entrepreneurship, the event has had a more political theme in the last decade, featuring social activism and get out the vote booths of a mostly liberal leaning. On election years, the festival falls two months before November polls. During the 2004 festival, the Daily Cal reported that two anti-gay marriage protesters were yelled at and sprayed with silly string. In 2007, an anti-abortion protester was cited by police after spilling a pile of fetus pictures from a wheelbarrow onto the street. The same year, U.S. Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA-9) participated in the parade but left early due to excessive heckling by onlookers, apparently in relation to her sole \\"Nay\\" vote against AUMF following the attacks on September 11, 2001. In 2000, Lee was responsible for inducting the Solano Stroll into the Library of Congress' Local Legacies Project campaign. In addition to the politically related controversies, the event has recently been affected by the financial shake-ups of various Solano businesses, including long-time Stroll sponsor Andronico's, the upscale supermarket chain which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Andronico's first location opened on Solano Avenue in 1929 as \\"Andronico's Park and Shop\\". Before the 2011 festival, the East Bay Express reported that live musicians would either take a pay cut or have to play for free due to the recession and lack of revenue generated from The Solano Avenue Association. The article reported that only two bands withdrew from the 2011 Solano Stroll, which was held on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and ran on a theme of \\"unsung heroes\\".

He was imprisoned from 2008 to 2010 on a charge of \\"being an accomplice to unlawful confinement\\". Amnesty International called the charges against him politically motivated and named him a prisoner of conscience. Tuot Saron served as a commune chief of Pong Ro commune, Baray District, Kampong Thom Province. In the months leading up to Cambodia's 2008 General Election, Tuot Saron and three colleagues were allegedly asked to protect an SRP candidate, Tim Norn, who had come under pressure to join the ruling Cambodian People‚Äôs Party (CPP). Following the candidate's later defection to the CPP, Tuot Saron was arrested on 18 March on charges of having abducted the candidate. On 20 March 2009, he was brought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Several international human rights groups protested his arrest. Human Rights Watch described the arrest as \\"dubious\\" and \\"part of a ruling party campaign to weaken political rivals prior to national elections\\". Amnesty International called the charges \\"baseless and politically motivated\\" and stated that they were filed \\"in order to intimidate other opposition party activists\\". The organization named Tuot Saron a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. Tuot Saron was released on 26 November 2010, following a Royal Pardon decree.

Biography At an early age he devoted himself to the study of the natural sciences, and in 1830/31 he visited Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and other provinces of the Turkish empire. He embarked for South America in 1834, traversed the greater part of that continent, and in 1836 returned to Europe by the way of Cape Horn. In 1841 he visited Arabia, Armenia, Persia, and the coast of Malabar, and in 1846 he visited the United States. After passing hurriedly through Canada, the United States, the Antilles, and Venezuela, he went to Quito, and thence started on an expedition to the Napo, a tributary of the Amazon. After several days' march he was abandoned by his native guides, but he succeeded in reaching the Napo alone, after a journey across a wide expanse of unsettled country and through trackless forests. He suffered for food, and during two weeks subsisted on palm leaves and a single kind of fruit. In 1848 he returned to Europe with a rich collection. He published Esplorazione delle regioni equatoriali lungo il Napo ed il fiume delle Amazzoni. Frammento di un viaggio fatto nelle due Americhe negli anni 1846-47-48 (Milan, 1850 first edition, 1854 second edition).

He is known for his promotion of general and clinical medicine and of Darwinian medicine. Perino first practised in rural areas of France. He then went to Central Africa where he practised tropical medicine . He later lived in South China for two years. In 1990, Perino resumed his practice in France and then started to teach clinical medicine and Human and Social Sciences at the University of Lyon, highlighting his classes with his broad experience. Perino plays the medical doctor in the movie The Consultation shot in 2007 by H√©l√®ne de Crecy, a one-hour and half documentary taking place behind closed doors in the office of a general practitioner. Books Perino is the author of several essays and novels the main topics of which are medicine and biology, anthropology and the history of science: *Les nouveaux paradoxes de la m√©decine (new paradox of medicine), 2012 *A quoi sert vraiment un m√©decin? (What good is a doctor?), 2011 *Une br√®ve histoire du m√©dicament (A short story of drugs), 2009. An essay about drugs and their history, ranging from the remote times of Homo Sapiens, when they resorted to magic and the divine to the new scientific market dominated by the invading and intrusive drug industry which influences the medical thinking and everyone's behavior. *Darwin viendra-t-il (Will Darwin Come?), 2008. The setting is Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860, a few months after the astonishing publication of Charles Darwin's ¬´ On the Origin of Species ¬ª. The British Science Association has set up a debate between the representatives of the Anglican Church and the Science Academy, both hostile to the natural selection theory promoted by Darwin. The author takes advantage of this debate to draw a gallery of portraits of Victorian scientists, religious and public figures. *Humeurs m√©dicales (Medical humour), 2006 *La sagesse du m√©decin (The Physician's Wisdom), 2004. The practice of a medical doctor can be seen as an iniatory journey and a way to discover oneself and the world. Each case leaves the physician pondering over life and Perino shows through many examples how simple questions has led him to thinking far from what he had been taught at the Medical school. *Carnets de sant√© (Medical Record), 2004 *Le Bobologue, 2001. A neologism which could be translated as ¬´ Physician of scratches, sores and pains ¬ª. Today the healing roles of a physician are multiple : psychiatrist, confessor, healer of many sores and wounds. In the end, the author is inclined to think that after 10.000 years a clinical physician is for his patients a shaman or a wizard.

In Afrikaans they are generally known as krompokkels, roughly meaning \\"little fat hunchbacks\\"; this name refers to their arched dorsal profile. The genus is indigenous to Sub-Saharan Africa. It includes the following species: * Plangia albolineata * Plangia deminuta * Plangia compressa * Plangia graminea * Plangia guttatipennis * Plangia karschi * Plangia laminifera * Plangia nebulosa * Plangia ovalifolia * Plangia segonoides * Plangia unimaculata * Plangia venata * Plangia villiersi Typical Plangia species are moderate-sized katydids, fairly effective green leaf mimics, that lay their fairly large, flattened oval eggs under bark, or in individual incisions in the edges of leaves of their food plants. They make the incisions into the leaf parenchyma, between, and parallel to, the dorsal and ventralleaf epidermis. The ovipositor is specialised for the purpose and it has a peculiar shape rather like the curved blade of a field hockey stick. In this respect the ovipositor differs from most other katydids, that tend to have straight, sometimes very long, ovipositors. The best-known pest species is Plangia graminea, a lightly built katydid; it is not of much commercial or agricultural importance, seldom worth controlling, but sometimes causes damage to foliage in vineyards and gardens.
