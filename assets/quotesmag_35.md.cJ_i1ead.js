Stassen Chair in International Affairs at the University of Minnesota. Inspired by his time as a member of the Israel Defense Forces, as a research consultant for Human Rights Watch, and as a research consultant for the International Red Cross, Ron asks: \\"what explains why states use different kinds of violence in some cases and not others?\\" For Ron, institutional distinctions and international norms are key to explaining diverse repertoires of state violence against similar victims.  Summary  In Frontiers and Ghettos, James Ron argues that states use different methods and degrees of coercion against perceived national enemies as a result of variation in institutional contexts. When a targeted group is ghettoized, they are likely to become victims of severe, police-style repression but not ethnic cleansing or murder. Contrarily, when a targeted group exists on a frontier, they are more likely to become victims of cleansing and death instead of repression. This is because in ghettos, states have unrivaled control but are also bound by international and domestic legal and moral obligations to its inhabitants. Along frontiers, states have less control as well as fewer and weaker moral obligations. According to Ron, the more that a state controls a given territory, the more it feels a ‚Äúbureaucratic, moral, and political sense of responsibility‚Äù for the fate of those within it.Ron, J. (2003). Frontiers & Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel. University of California Press. This sense of responsibility leads states to choose less overtly violent modes of repression in ghettos as compared to when states target populations exist on the periphery.  Case Studies  James Ron examines five cases of ethnic violence and ethnic policing in two States, Serbia and Israel, over similar periods of time. The cases are as follows: # Serbian ethnic cleansing on the Bosnian frontier from 1992-1993. # Serbian ethnic policing against non-serbs in the Sandzak and Vojvodina from 1992-1993. # Serbian switch from ethnic policing in Kosovo from 1990-1997 to ethnic cleansing in 1998-1999. # Israeli repression of Palestinians during The First Intifada in the West Bank and Gaza in 1988. # Israeli destruction of PLO forces and Palestinian refugees during the 1982 Lebanon War. Ron uses field interviews, newspaper reports and academic publications to illustrate the importance of institutional context for explaining repertoires of state violence. He argues that Serbia engaged in ethnic cleansing in Bosnia because in 1992, Bosnia became a frontier. On the other hand, Israel policed Palestinians in 1988 because Palestine at the time was a ghetto, even though the threat posed by Palestinians during the 1988 uprising was greater. The more states controlled territories and peoples, the less likely their security forces were to ethnically cleanse perceived national enemies.  Reception  Frontiers and Ghettos was favorably received by many sociologists and political scientists as well as human rights organizations working on issues related to state violence. For example, the historian L. Carl Brown, writing for Foreign Affairs magazine, wrote that the book offered \\"a well-documented study of Ron's chosen examples and a sophisticated framework for understanding other such situations.\\"Brown, L. Carl. (2003). Review of Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel in Foreign Affairs. Sociologist Anthony Obserschall compliments Ron for his \\"engaging and promising\\" hypothesis as well as his \\"fascinating\\" use of detail that make the footnotes as pleasurable to read as the main text.\\"Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel by James Ron. Review by: Anthony Oberschall. Social Forces, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1657-1659 However, Obserschall also critiques Ron on several grounds. For example, he argues that (1) the ethnic policing versus cleansing distinction is too crude for legal and normative evaluations of state violence, and (2) the frontier concept is applied inconsistently for the comparisons Ron wishes to make. In the former critique, Obserschall notes how 750 Palestinians were killed during The First Intifada, 13,000 were wounded, hundreds lost their homes, and thousands were arrested and detained. In the latter critique, Obserschall writes that the Lebanese frontier and Bosnian frontier are not as comparable as Ron makes them out to be. Bosniaks in Bosnia were unarmed and defenseless whereas Palestinian paramilitaries in South Lebanon were heavily armed and frequently engaged in cross-border military actions against Israelis. Political Scientist Darius Rejali writes that Ron argues \\"persuasively\\" why it is important to study not just why violence is done, but how. He adds, \\"[Ron's] \\"study of the practice shows that international norms are far more robust than political scientists normally imagine\\".Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel by James Ron.

The Social Liberal Forum originated as a group that represented the centre-left within the British Liberal Democrats, but membership is now open also to people who are not members of the Liberal Democrats but who share the SLF's values and principles; since 2018 this has included liberal progressives of all parties and none. The SLF regularly organises fringe events at the Liberal Democrat Federal Conference and, increasingly, provides speakers to events elsewhere. Overview The SLF was launched in February 2009. The book Reinventing the State: Social Liberalism for the 21st Century has been said to be influential on the thinking of those who created the SLF. The SLF did not take a corporate position on the suitability of the Coalition Government between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives and campaigned for many changes to Coalition policy on issues such as NHS reforms, economic policy and cuts to welfare spending. The SLF advances social liberal policies, theory and thought leadership within British politics, often in opposition to free market fundamentalism. It takes inspiration from the political ideas of William Beveridge, John Maynard Keynes, Thomas Hill Green, Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse, David Lloyd George, Jo Grimond and Charles Kennedy amongst others. The SLF has supported a wide range of socio-economic policies including the introduction of a universal basic income, opposition to welfare reforms and support for wealth taxation, economic democracy and Keynesian economics. Conference and Lecture Every July since 2011, the SLF has held a one-day annual conference; and since 2012, this includes a William Beveridge Memorial Lecture.

Christian existential apologetics may also be distinguished from Christian existentialism and from experiential apologetics. The former is a philosophic outlook concerned with the human condition in general; the latter consists of evidential argumentation based on religious experience. Existential apologetics Christian existential apologetics is ‚Äúthe demonstration that Christian faith is justified because it satisfies certain emotional and spiritual needs.‚ÄùClifford Williams, Existential Reasons for Belief in God: A Defense of Desires and Emotions for Faith (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2011) p. 13. It typically consists of ‚Äúexistential arguments for believing in God‚Äù that are expressed as follows: # Humans have certain ‚Äúexistential‚Äù needs. N. T. Wright lists four such needs: ‚Äúthe longing for justice, the quest for spirituality, the hunger for relationships, and the delight in beauty.‚Äù N. T. Wright, Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense (New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2006), p. x. Clifford Williams lists thirteen: ‚ÄúWe need cosmic security. We need to know that we will live beyond the grave in a state that is free from the defects of this life, a state that is full of goodness and justice. We need a more expansive life, one in which we love and are loved. We need meaning, and we need to know that we are forgiven for going astray. We also need to experience awe, to delight in goodness and to be present with those we love.‚ÄùWilliams, Existential Reasons for Belief in God, p. 32. # Faith in God satisfies these needs. # Therefore, faith in God is justified. Williams states that this argument is not the same as an evidential argument: \\"A person who is convinced of an existential argument says, 'I believe because I am satisfied when I do.' A person who is convinced of an evidential argument says, 'I believe because there is a good reason to do so.'\\"Williams, Existential Reasons for Belief in God, p. 45. He also states that the argument is different from C. S. Lewis‚Äôs argument from desire, which argues that there is an explanation of the source of the existential needs: ‚ÄúIf I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.‚ÄùC.

It was moved from its earlier location in Sneek in 2011 where it was known as the Himmole. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 22914. It is fully functional and can be used to help drain the adjacent polder. History The original windmill was built in the eighteenth century and located near Grou and called Minne Finne. The mill was moved to Sneek in 1982 and renamed Himmole, though the Minne Finne was in such a bad state of repair that its relocation was in fact a reconstruction with no or very few parts of the original windmill being reused. The new mill was also quite a bit larger than the old mill. The mill was built here as compensation for the loss of the windmill 't Op of Oppenhuizen (part of Sneek) that was moved to Koudum. The new location near Sneek deteriorated from growing trees, nearby buildings and a new road. In 2011 the windmill was moved again, this time to IJlst, only 300 metres from timber windmill De Rat. This is the location where the first Terpensmole was built some time before 1832 and stood into the twentieth century, so the moved mill has been given this historic name. Description Mill and miller in November 2011 The Terpensmole is what the Dutch describe as a \\"spinnenkop\\". It is a small hollow post mill winded by a winch. The four common sails have a span of and are carried on a wooden windshaft.

Silverio, Sr. It operated under a technical tie-up with Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan,Doner, p. 43 but also produced its own range of small off-roaders called the \\"Delta Mini Cruiser\\". Delta was founded in 1962 and continued to be Toyota's local assembler and distributor until 1984. History In addition to assembling Toyotas for the local market, Delta also used their own name to market the \\"Mini Cruiser\\", a little off- roader appearing a lot like a scaled-down 40-series Toyota Land Cruiser and using Toyota engines and other technology. It was developed in the mid- seventies especially for the Philippine Army as the M-1777, but was also sold commercially. The Mini Cruiser (sometimes called the Explorer) was even exported, to Colombia, Papua New Guinea, the Middle East and to Italy.Doner, p. 316 In Italy it was sold by Gandin Auto from 1980. Imported by Plan Motor Italia of Turin, the car was marketed by Gandin Auto in Treviso. The engines originally offered were a Philippine-built Toyota 1587 cc four-cylinder (12R) with 69 PS, or the Isuzu C190 1951 cc diesel engine with 63 PS. After a reintroduction and some changes first presented at the 1984 Expofuoristrada in Turin, the diesel was replaced by VM Motori's 2393 cc \\"HR492\\" turbodiesel (100 PS) which was installed by the importer. 1984 prices ranged from 15,024,000 for 4AG-engined version to 19,972,000 lira for the turbodiesel (p. 163). About 500 units were sold in Italy until supplies dried up in 1986, following Delta's untimely bankruptcy in 1984. The now rare Delta Mini Cruiser also became available as a two-seater pickup truck, estate, van, and as a five-seater jeep in the 1980s. An interesting development was one of the first \\"Asian Utility Vehicles\\" (AUV), the Toyota Tamaraw. This little utilitarian car was based on the Indonesian Kijang, and the \\"Tamaraw\\" name continues to be used in the Philippine market today, also becoming a colloquial term for any AUV. Toyota themselves refer to this car as a BUV, for \\"Basic Utility Vehicle\\". The BUV was intended to be a general-purpose vehicle for developing countries, designed to meet local needs and facilitate technology transfers in order to respond to the domestic production policies of various Asian countries. Philippine assembly began in December 1976. Delta also built Toyota's 12R engine, the tools and die-sets for which were acquired through the Philippine National Bank (PNB) as part of Japan's war reparations to the Philippines. Long wheelbase Delta Mini Cruiser belonging to the Philippine Army The end Silverio fell out of favor with then Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos during the Philippine economic downturn in the early eighties. Operations came to a halt in December 1983 and by March 1984 Toyota cancelled their tie-up. The company was dissolved in 1988, with 35% of its assets going to Toyota and Mitsui and the remaining 65% going to the Philippine National Bank.

An avid traveler and jazz aficionado, Brown and his wife, Sylvia, have given millions to various charitable causes under the aegis of the Baltimore-based Eddie C. and C. Sylvia Brown Family Foundation.The Boule Journal, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Volume 75/Number 2/Summer 2011  Early life  Brown was born to 13-year-old Annie Mae Brown in Apopka, Florida, a rural hamlet in the central part of the state where agriculture dominated the local economy and Jim Crow laws kept blacks and whites rigidly ensconced in their separate, unequal, worlds. Brown‚Äôs mother left town when she was 15. From that point forward, Brown‚Äôs grandparents Jake and Mamie Brown Sr. and his uncle, Jake Brown Jr. ‚Äì took over his socialization. Brown‚Äôs proclivity for academic excellence first manifested itself in elementary school, prompting his grandmother to pay for a typewriter and typing lessons for her grandson. She was determined to have him avoid performing manual labor in the Apopka citrus groves that supported his grandparents. To this day, Brown still types proficiently enough to dash out 60 error-free words per minute. When Brown was six, his entrepreneurial Uncle Jake taught him how to drive a flatbed truck, enabling fruit pickers to load boxes of oranges, grapefruit, and tangerines in Apopka‚Äôs citrus groves. Jake also ran a thriving moonshine enterprise in central Florida and under his tutelage, Brown was piloting hotrods filled with white lightning by the time he was 11. A disapproving relative quietly contacted Brown‚Äôs mother, who snatched her son out of Apopka and relocated him to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Brown attended an integrated high school in Allentown where he continued to be a top academic performer. He graduated with honors from Allentown High School, one of five African Americans out of a class of 760 students. Still Brown had no realistic prospect of attending college, until a white Allentown woman who owned a casket making business offered to subsidize his higher education. Brown never met his benefactor, whose offer was made through a proxy. One of his lifelong regrets is never having thanked her face-to-face. But her legacy lives on because her kindness triggered in Brown a passionate interest in philanthropy. His benefactor‚Äôs largesse allowed Brown to earn a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1961, which he received from Howard University, in Washington, D.C.  Career  After matriculating from Howard, Brown worked for a few months with defense contractor Martin Marietta in Orlando, Florida, where he did quality control work on Titan Intercontinental ballistic missiles. That ended after Brown was called into Army service as a lieutenant at Ft. Monmouth County, New Jersey, to satisfy a military obligation Brown incurred when he joined the Army Reserve Officers‚Äô Training Corps program at Howard University. Following two years on active duty as a Signal Corps officer, Brown joined IBM‚Äôs Systems Development Division in Poughkeepsie, New York. Brown spent five years designing computer circuits for large mainframe computers while employed by IBM, and also earned a master‚Äôs degree in electrical engineering from New York University. During his time at IBM Brown became increasingly fascinated with finance and investing, so he opted to take advantage of an IBM management development program that allowed him to earn an MBA degree from Indiana University in 1970.2006 Marylander Of Distinction/Maryland You Are Beautiful program Eager to learn everything he could about wealth creation and use it for his family‚Äôs benefit, Brown joined Irwin Management Co., in Columbus, Indiana, eventually becoming a member of the money management firm‚Äôs marketable securities group. In 1973 Brown moved to Baltimore to take a position as a portfolio manager with investment firm T. Rowe Price. A decade later Brown left to start Brown Capital Management, which initially operated out of his suburban Baltimore home. A valuation-conscious investor, Brown put his company‚Äôs focus on stocks offering growth-at-a- reasonable-price, or GARP. Brown Capital Management caters to high-net-worth individuals, pension and profit sharing plans, charitable organizations and corporations.http://investing.businessweek.com, retrieved Oct. 25, 2011 In the early years of Brown Capital Management, Brown‚Äôs ability to attract investors received a welcome boost when he became a regular panelist on the PBS financial television program Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser, which was popular during the 1980s and 1990s. ‚ÄúEd is one of the most careful, and successful, students of securities alive today, and he gives us the specifics of what‚Äôs on his list,‚Äù Rukeyser noted.Louis Rukeyser‚Äôs Wall Street newsletter, February 1996 Brown Capital Management celebrated its 30th year in business in 2013, occupies a three-story building at 1201 North Calvert Street in downtown Baltimore and employs 37 workers. Brown continues to find money management a compelling and invigorating exercise, and remains an active and highly engaged participant in the day-to-day operations of the company he founded. ‚ÄúThis is the kind of business that, if you really enjoy it, like I do, it‚Äôs not like work, it‚Äôs like fun,‚Äù Brown says.  Personal life  Brown married his college sweetheart from Howard University, the former Sylvia Thurston, on Aug. 11, 1962, in King William, Virginia. The Browns have two daughters and three grandsons. Possessing a longtime interest in aviation, Brown tried to attend helicopter flight school while he was a lieutenant in the Army, but was rejected after the vision in one eye failed to pass visual acuity standards. Years later Brown got a private pilots license for civilian fixed-wing aircraft, but stopped flying after his flights started to become too infrequent for him to remain proficient. A golf enthusiast who's also an avid photographer, Brown is a major collector of African-American art. Brown‚Äôs primary residence is in suburban Baltimore, and he also maintains homes in Florida and Maine.  Recognition  Brown has received an impressive number of awards and encomiums, to include the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.Correspondence from Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara A.

It is a generalist animal, being able to exploit numerous different habitats and foodstuffs. The American black bear is listed by the IUCN as least concern, due to the species widespread distribution and a large global population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Bobcat Bobcat Order: Carnivora, Family: Felidae Occurrence: Open forests, brushy areas - C The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American mammal of the cat family, Felidae. With twelve recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, forest edges and swampland environments. It persists in much of its original range and populations are healthy. Cougar Cougar Order: Carnivora, Family: Felidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests - C The cougar (Puma concolor), also known as puma, mountain lion, mountain cat, catamount or panther, depending on the region, is a mammal of the family Felidae, native to the Americas. This large, solitary cat has the greatest range of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere, extending from Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes of South America. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in every major American habitat type. It is the second heaviest cat in the American continents after the jaguar. Although large, the cougar is most closely related to smaller felines. Coyote Coyote Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Forests, grasslands - C The coyote ( or )coyote - Definitions from Dictionary.com (Canis latrans), also known as the American jackal or the prairie wolf,prairie wolf. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07 is a species of canid found throughout North and Central America, ranging from Panama in the south, north through Mexico, the United States and Canada. It occurs as far north as Alaska and all but the Arctic portions of Canada. Elk The subspecies Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) occurs in the park. Elk Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Open forests, meadows - C The elk, or wapiti (Cervus canadensis), is one of the largest species of deer in the world and one of the largest mammals in North America and eastern Asia. In the deer family (Cervidae), only the moose, Alces alces (called an \\"elk\\" in Europe), is larger, and Cervus unicolor (the sambar deer) can rival the C. canadensis elk in size. Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Mountain goat The mountain goat is an introduced species within the park. The park and Forest Service are undertaking projects to relocate mountain goats to the Cascade mountains. ountain goat Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Bovidae Occurrence: High peaks and meadows - CL, I The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), also known as the Rocky Mountain goat, is a large- hoofed mammal found only in North America. Despite its vernacular name, it is not a member of Capra, the genus of true goats. It resides at high elevations and is a sure-footed climber, often resting on rocky cliffs that predators cannot reach. Mule deer Black-tailed deer The black-tailed deer sub- species (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) is found in the park. Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Open forests, meadows, often at high elevations - C The mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is a deer whose habitat is in the western half of North America. It gets its name from its large mule-like ears. Adult male mule deer are called bucks, adult females are called does, and young of both sexes are called fawns. The black-tailed deer is considered by some a distinct species though it is classified as a subspecies of the mule deer. Unlike its cousin, the white-tailed deer, mule deer are generally more associated with the land west of the Missouri River. The most noticeable differences between whitetails and mule deer are the color of their tails and configuration of their antlers. The mule deer's tail is black tipped. Gray wolf (historical) Although native to the park, the gray wolf was extirpated from the park in the 19th Century. Their former dens are now home to coyotes. Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests - E Northwestern wolf is a subspecies of a gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus), often known simply as the wolf which is the largest wild member of the family Canidae. It is an ice age survivor originating during the Late Pleistocene around 300,000 years ago.Nowak, R. 1992. Wolves: The great travelers of evolution. International Wolf 2(4):3 - 7. DNA sequencing and genetic drift studies reaffirm that the gray wolf shares a common ancestry with the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Although certain aspects of this conclusion have been questioned, the main body of evidence confirms it. A number of other gray wolf subspecies have been identified, though the actual number of subspecies is still open to discussion. Gray wolves are typically apex predators in the ecosystems they occupy. Red fox The red fox is an introduced species within the park. Red fox kits Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Grasslands, open forest - R, I The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a small canid native to much of North America and Eurasia, as well as northern Africa. It is the most recognizable species of fox and in many areas it is referred to simply as \\"the fox\\". As its name suggests, its fur is predominantly reddish-brown, but there is a naturally occurring grey morph known as the \\"silver\\" fox. The red fox is by far the most widespread and abundant species of fox, found in almost every single habitat in the Northern Hemisphere, from the coastal marshes of United States, to the alpine tundras of Tibetan Plateau.

J. O'Shee, was an Irish nationalist politician, solicitor, labour activist and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland representing the constituency of West Waterford from 1895 until 1918.Maume, Patrick in: McGuire, James and Quinn, James (eds): Dictionary of Irish Biography, From the Earliest Times to the Year 2002. Royal Irish Academy; Vol. 7, pp. 946‚Äì47: O'Shee, James John; Cambridge University Press (2009) Elected as an Anti-Parnellite member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he was one of the more socially radical members of the party.Maume, Patrick: The Long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, \\"Who's Who\\" p. 239, Gill & Macmillan (1999) He co-founded and was secretary from 1894 of the Irish Land and Labour Association Origins O'Shee was born as John James Shee on 3 November 1866 at Newtown, near Carrick-on-Suir Co. Tipperary as the youngest of four sons of John Shee, a farmer, and his wife Mary (n√©e Britton). He had five sisters all of whom became nuns. He attended the local national school, completing his education at Rockwell College and University College Dublin. He first served as a law apprentice with James O'Sullivan in Carraig- on-Suir before qualify as a solicitor in 1890. He subsequently opened his own practice in the town, establishing a branch office later in Clonmel. Shee changed his name in 1900 to O'Shee. Political activist While still an apprentice he became politically active and won a considerable reputation as a public speaker and man of action. In 1894 in alliance with D. D. Sheehan he co-founded the Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA), chaired by Sheehan with O'Shee as secretary. They campaigned for radical changes in land and labour laws, in particular the granting of smallholdings to rural labourers. The Irish Party leaders suspected this independent organisation from the beginning.Maume, Patrick: p.71 A year later in 1895 O‚ÄôShee was elected as an anti-Parnellite to represent the constituency of West Waterford at Westminster, which seat he held until 1918.Walker, Brian M. (ed.): Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801‚Äì1922, Royal Irish Academy Press, Dublin (1978) From 1898 Sheehan put all his energies into building up the ILLA, which spread across Munster and by 1904 peaked 144 branches.Bradley, Dan: Farm Labourers: Irish struggle 1900‚Äì1976, Ch.2: Farm Labourer Organisations in Co. Cork before 1919 pp.24‚Äì37, (1988) Athol Books Although Sheehan was a Parnellite when elected MP for Mid-Cork in 1901, the Sheehan-O'Shee's alliance reflected how the Parnell split could be bridged by seeking co-operation in an independent organisation. Sheehan speaking of O'Shee wrote that ‚Äú we co-operated heartily in and out of Parliament in making the Labour organisation a real and vital force, and our relations for many useful years, ‚Äì were of the most cordial and kindly kind\\".Sheehan, D. D., Ireland since Parnell, p.178, Daniel O'Connor, London (1921) The Irish Party leadership on the other hand, refused to consider direct Parliamentary representation to the Land and Labour Association, an indication of the middle-class determination with maintaining its hold over national politics.Lane, P√°draig G., The Land and Labour Association 1894‚Äì1914, Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, Vol.98, p.92, (1993), Cork City Council Library  Party politics  With the introduction of the Wyndham Land Purchase Act of 1903 won by William O'Brien MP, O'Shee achieved some notable successes in negotiating land purchase, the Bessborough (Ponsonby) estates being remembered as a particular triumph. However the leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP), John Dillon and Joseph Devlin strongly opposed the O'Shee-Sheehan ILLA alliance, particularly after Sheehan grew closer to the dissident O'Brien when he was alienated from the party in 1904 after his policy of conciliation was rejected by its leaders. O'Shee aligned himself with the leadership of John Redmond. Dillon decided to intervene and set about splitting the ILLA in 1905, forming a new \\"original\\" ILLA group, strictly subservient to the Party, under the loyal \\"Redmonite\\" O'Shee. Purpose: ‚Äì to confine Sheehan's movement, otherwise \\"the whole of Munster will be poisoned and no seat safe on vacancy\\".O'Brien, Joseph: William O'Brien and the course of Irish politics p.170, University of California Press (1976), O‚ÄôShee's organisation was forthwith the only one recognised by the Party and permitted to attend Irish Party or United Irish League conventions. O'Shee was mainly supported by the ILLA branches in Tipperary and Wexford. Sheehan's stronghold was in Cork, acting as O'Brien's backbone organisation, Kerry and Limerick were divided. Attempts at a reunion were thwarted by O'Shee's insistence that Sheehan must step down. In the long run the Party's intervention weakened Sheehan's renamed LLA group, and the labour movement in general.  Multiple career  O'Shee found it difficult initially to combine his responsibilities as a solicitor with those of his political career, and was in fact reprimanded by Redmond in 1903 for his failing to attend parliament regularly. This was alleviated when his brother became a solicitor, joined his practise and took over much of O'Shee's workload. This enabled him to extend his practise across Kilkenny, Waterford and Tipperary synergising it with supporting negotiations in land purchase. His legal knowledge also proved valuable in his parliamentary work on social legislation. He was one of the few members of the IPP who took a singular course in many matters. In 1913 he supported a woman's suffrage bill, despite instructions to vote against it (which Redmond did). At the outbreak of the Great War he actively recruited in support of Ireland's involvement in the war, but after the 1916 Rising he urged that a more nationalistic approach be taken. At the outset of the Irish Convention he joined Arthur Lynch and four other MPs in signing a declaration that no partition based settlement would be acceptable. He regarded the idea of separation as absurd because Ireland was dependent on the British market.  After years  His tenacity saw him take his stand in the 1918 Irish general election, where he was defeated by Sinn F√©in's Cathal Brugha in the new West Waterford constituency. On 1 June 1921 O'Shee married Anne Mary (Nancy), daughter of Thomas B. Naughton, farmer of Mullinahone, Co. Tipperary. They had two sons and four daughters. James John O'Shee continued to practise law in Clonmel until he retired in 1935. He moved some time later to Pembroke Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin, where he died on 1 January 1946.Obituaries: Irish Independent, 2 January 1946; Waterford Star, 4 January 1946  Notes  References * Sheehan, D.

Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya‚Äôaqobi during some unrelated digging near Maoz Haim, it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211 The synagogue was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for Jews there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89 Layout The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.◊ê◊§◊®◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ò◊®◊ü. ◊ê◊†◊¶◊ô◊ß◊ú◊ï◊§◊ì◊ô◊î ◊î◊ó◊ì◊©◊î ◊ú◊ó◊§◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊®◊õ◊ô◊ê◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the Tabernacle.Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199 The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards Jerusalem. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195 This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary. Apse The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a chancel screen which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222 Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised bima area is what shows that this was no exception.Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87 The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as Hebrew letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was Shalom; the remainder of the inscriptions were in Greek. Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88 Mosaic Floor There were many interesting mosaics which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a menorah, an etrog, a shofar and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367 In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of geometric patterns. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards. Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

The collision resulted in a fire and explosion that damaged Carroll College and other nearby structures, knocked out power to most of the town, and led to the evacuation of residents within an area of due to concerns of possible toxic chemical release. The event occurred during a severe cold snap, with temperatures below that morning and with a wind chill factor of as much as , which froze the water that firefighters used to attempt to extinguish the fire. Event In the early morning of February 2, 1989, during a record cold snap, a Montana Rail Link freight train picked up three extra \\"pusher\\" locomotives in Helena, Montana, to help move the train over Mullan Pass. The train then traveled west from Helena. Halfway up the pass, the lead engine developed an electrical problem that caused a loss of power and at about the same time was stopped by a malfunctioning signal. The train crew then parked the train at the Austin siding, on the east side of Mullan Pass. While waiting for the signal to be fixed, the crew uncoupled the engines from the 48-car train to switch the order of the locomotives, setting the air brakes but not the hand brakes on the cars. At about 5:30 a.m., record cold temperatures caused the air brakes to fail on the decoupled cars. The cars then rolled backwards downhill, uncontrolled, into Helena, crashed into a parked work train near the Benton Avenue crossing and Carroll College, caught fire, and exploded. The explosion awakened many local residents, some of whom thought it was an earthquake. The blast caused extensive damage to Carroll College, shaking St. Charles Hall, a classroom and dormitory building, and shattering most of the windows in Guadelupe Hall, the women's dormitory. A piece of a railroad car landed in the college library, which was vacant at the time due to the early hour of the day. Other buildings damaged in Helena included the scagliola columns and other interior features of the Cathedral of St. Helena, located over away. No one was killed, but the explosion disabled electric service to much of the community, as well as to some residents outside Helena, including rolling brownouts extending as far north as Great Falls, Montana, approximately away. It shattered windows distant, ejected debris for blocks, and increased concerns about toxic gases spreading through the community. Neighborhoods within a radius of were evacuated. Weather The temperature at the time of the accident was about and the resulting power outage disabled heat for a significant number of community residents. Later consequences included water damage to buildings resulting from frozen plumbing and other difficulties that necessitated expensive repairs and plagued local residences for years. The event headlined a three-minute story on winter weather on NBC News that evening. The cold snap that ran from January 30 to February 4 was ranked number 4 on the NOAA's list of Montana's Top Weather/Water/Climate events of the 20th century. The temperature remained colder than for 84 hours. A record low, , occurred on February 4. Wind chill was as low as . Firefighters were hampered by water freezing as they attempted to use hoses to extinguish the blaze. Hazardous materials First responders were concerned about the potential for exposure to toxic chemicals, as they did not know at the time what materials were being transported by the freight cars. The explosion was later determined to have been caused by a tanker carrying isopropyl alcohol, which caught fire and caused an explosion in another nearby car containing hydrogen peroxide. This was deemed a hazardous materials release. The accident, particularly due to the chemical release, has been used as an example of the risks inherent in rail transportation, particularly by those assessing the risks of rail transportation of nuclear materials. This derailment was part of a 2003 study of highway and train derailment accidents by the United States Department of Energy on accident sequence and nuclear risk.

Life Born at Hetherset, Norfolk, he was descended from William Master of Cirencester. He was admitted to Corpus Christi College in 1731; graduated B.A. in 1734, M.A. in 1738, B.D. in 1746; and was fellow and tutor of the college from 1738 to 1750. On 14 May 1752, he was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He continued to reside in college till he was presented by that society to the rectory of Landbeach, Cambridgeshire, in 1756. Matthias Mawson, bishop of Ely, collated him to the vicarage of Linton, which he resigned for that of Waterbeach in 1759. This latter benefice he with the bishop's permission resigned in 1784 to his son William, for whom he built a house. Masters was in the commission of the peace for Cambridgeshire, and acted as deputy to William Compton, LL.D., chancellor of the diocese of Ely, who resided abroad. In 1797, he resigned the living of Landbeach in favour of Thomas Cooke Burroughes, senior fellow of Caius College, who, immediately upon his presentation, married Mary, Masters's second daughter. Masters continued to reside in the parsonage with his son-in- law and daughter until his death on 5 July 1798. He was buried at Landbeach, where a monument was erected to his memory. Works His major work is: The History of the College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary (commonly called Bene't) in the University of Cambridge, from its foundation to the present time. It was published in two parts by Cambridge University Press: the first part appeared in 1753, followed in 1755 by the second part, containing the lives of members of the college and an appendix of documents. An expanded edition by Dr. John Lamb appeared at Cambridge in 1831.

The test was developed in 1944 by Al Steiner of Underwriters Laboratories, and has been incorporated as a reference into North American standards for materials testing as tests ASTME84, NFPA255, UL723 and ULCS102. These standards are in widespread use for the regulation and selection of materials for interior building construction throughout North America. The test may be carried out inside a dedicated, instrumented test apparatus. The test itself involves an assembly of the tested material, fabricated into an otherwise noncombustible horizontal box or tunnel as the tunnel's roof, in a section long and wide. The tunnel is as wide and long as the test specimen, and high. The apparatus is equipped with two gas burners providing a flame intensity of 89 kilowatts, and air and combustion products are moved through the tunnel by a ventilation system at a controlled velocity of per minute. The progress of the flame front across the test material is measured by visual observation, while the smoke emitted from the end of the test assembly is measured as a factor of optical density. A flame spread index (FSI) and a smoke-developed index are calculated from these results. Both indices use an arbitrary scale in which asbestos-cement board has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. The tunnel test does not measure the ignitability of materials, nor does it properly assess the behavior of thermoplastic materials which may tend to melt and drip from the assembly, or for materials with slow flame spread properties. It likewise does not give a true assessment of the smoke emanating from very thin materials. Other tests, such as the \\"critical radiant flux\\" test (ASTM E648/NFPA 253) are more suitable for establishing ignitability. The \\"methenamine pill test\\" (ASTM D 2859) is used to judge the ignitability of flooring carpet.

He is mainly remembered today for the murderous assault on him by Sir James Keating, the Prior of Kilmainham, in 1462. Career He was the son of Luke Dowdall of County Louth. The Dowdalls were a Derbyshire family who originated at Dovedale, and came to Ireland in the thirteenth century, where they were mainly based at Newtown and Termonfeckin.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. A History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble 1993 p. 116 Later members of the family included George Dowdall, Archbishop of Armagh, James Dowdall, the Catholic martyr, and his cousin, also James Dowdall, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Dovedale, Derbyshire He was appointed King's Serjeant in 1435 and Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1438; he held that office until his death in 1482. He was Deputy Treasurer of Ireland in 1461 and was knighted the same year. He married Anne Wogan of Rathcoffey, County Kildare, in 1454. He resided mainly at Clontarf near Dublin.Ball F. Elrington The Judges in ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.i, p. 177 He was a companion of the Brotherhood of Saint George, a short-lived military order founded by King Edward IV in 1474 for the defence of the Pale. Attempted murder Dowdall is chiefly remembered for the murderous assault on him in 1462 by Sir James Keating, Prior of the Knights Hospitallers. At Pentecost 1462, Dowdall, who was making a pilgrimage to a holy well near Kilmainham, County Dublin, was attacked by Keating with a sword and was put in fear of his life.Thomas D'Arcy McGee A Popular History of Ireland from the Earliest Times to Catholic Emancipation Montreal 1862 3 Volumes There seems no reason to doubt that the Prior meant to kill him. Dowdall prosecuted Keating before the Irish Parliament, which found the Prior guilty of assault. He was fined ¬£100, and ordered to pay Dowdall 100 marks as compensation, but was apparently able on technical grounds to evade making either payment.McGee History of Ireland The motive for the attack is unknown: Elrington Ball, comparing it to the murder of James Cornwalsh, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, twenty years earlier, argued that crimes of violence were endemic medieval Ireland.Ball, p.100 However, equally savage crimes took place in contemporary England, such as the murder in 1455 of the respected lawyer Nicholas Radford by Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon.Ross, Charles Edward IV Methuen London 1974 p. 390 Such incidents demonstrate a general breakdown of law and order in both kingdoms in the mid-fifteenth century, which greatly weakened the authority of the English Crown. Keating, despite his clerical office, was clearly a violent and turbulent individual, who dealt with an attempt to remove him as Prior by throwing his intended successor, Marmaduke Langley, into prison, where he died. He was disgraced many years later for his part in the attempt to put the pretender Lambert Simnel on the throne of England, and died in wretched poverty in about 1491.

As with many later Flynn features, the tangled production history is arguably more interesting: Marshall, the co-producer and husband of Micheline Presle, began shooting in France with no experience as a director and without realizing that French law required a parallel French-language version. Robert Florey, who had directed Flynn in his last bit part in 1935, was hired as an uncredited \\"consultant\\". The same year Marshall and Flynn also produced the unreleased Hello God. Premise An ambitious girl (Micheline Presle) uses a sea captain (Errol Flynn) to climb the social ladder in old New Orleans. Cast * Errol Flynn as Captain Fabian * Micheline Presle as Lea Mariotte * Vincent Price as George Brissac * Agnes Moorehead as Aunt Jezebel * Victor Francen as Henri Brissac * Jim G√©rald as Commissioner Germain * H√©l√©na Manson as Josephine * Howard Vernon as Emile * Roger Blin as Philippe Production The film was originally known as The Bargain and was based on a script by Errol Flynn himself. Flynn entered into a multi-picture deal with William Marshall to produce the film, among others, in July 1949. It was to be produced independently with a distributor sought later. Micheline Presle was borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play the female lead. G√©rard Philipe was to be in the cast but did not appear in the end. (Presle and Marshall later married.) At one stage the film was also known as Bloodline and New Orleans Adventure. Filming started on July 15, 1950 in Paris under the title of The Bargain. Exteriors representing New Orleans were recreated in the city of Villefranche with studio scenes shot at the Victorine Studios in Nice and the Billancourt Studios in Paris. The film was meant to be shot in French and English versions but Marshall persuaded the French government to allow it to be made in English only. Robert Florey started the English production but not long after shooting began Marshall took over.Tony Thomas, Rudy Behlmer & Clifford McCarty, The Films of Errol Flynn, Citadel Press, 1969 p 174-175 Under Errol Flynn's contract with Warner Bros, he was allowed to make one \\"outside\\" film a year until 1962, provided it had a major distributor. Flynn later claimed that during filming, William Marshall \\"secretly\\" committed the film to being released by Republic Pictures, one of the smaller studios. Both Warner Bros and MGM, who had films starring Flynn awaiting release, were unhappy with this. Flynn worried that Warner Bros would use this as an excuse to cancel their contract with him on the basis that Republic was not a major. On 18 December 1950 he filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court asking them to stop Republic from releasing the film and to stop Warner Bros from cancelling the contract until the court could determine that Republic was a \\"major\\" distributor. Release Box Office The film was reasonably successful at the box office in France. Critical reception The Los Angeles Times said that the film \\"is much in need of both editing and shortening. It will draw approval for the colourfulness of its settings and interesting costuming. The audience seemed to enjoy it though there was a tendency towards laughter for scenes not especially designed for comedy... One cannot conclude that this picture in its present shape hangs together satisfactorily.\\" Filmink magazine wrote that \\" It's not a terribly accomplished screenplay ‚Äì it constantly changes protagonists, not in an interesting way... and is confusing ‚Äì but at least it has ambition\\" adding that \\"the quality of the cast is high\\" and \\"there's always something happening on screen, the production values are decent (costumes, sets), and its ambition is endearing. \\" Proposed sequels The movie was meant to be the first of two films from Flynn and Marshall, the second which was to be The Man Who Cried, a psychological thriller about the perfect crime set over a four-hour period, but this wasn't made due to a dispute between Marshall and Flynn over Hello God. Lawsuits In November 1951, Charles Gross, an associate of Flynn's, sued claiming payments due for working on the screenplay. In January 1952, Flynn asked a court to formally end the partnership with Marshall. In 1954, Vincent Price sued Flynn and Marshall for $15,000 in unpaid wages, claiming he had been promised a fee of $35,000. A court awarded in his favour in 1957.

It is the only United States patent ever registered to a President of the United States. Lincoln conceived the idea of inventing a mechanism that would lift a boat over shoals and obstructions when on two occasions the boat on which he traveled got hung up on obstructions. The original documentation of this patent was rediscovered in 1997. This device was composed of large bellows attached to the sides of a boat that were expandable due to air chambers. His successful patent application led to his drafting and delivering two lectures on the subject of patents while he was President. Lincoln was at times a patent attorney and was familiar with the patent application process as well as patent lawsuit proceedings. Among his notable patent law experiences was litigation over the mechanical reaper; both he and his future Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, provided counsel for John Henry Manny.. Background The invention stemmed from Lincoln's experiences ferrying travelers and carrying freight on the Great Lakes and some midwestern rivers. In 1860, Lincoln wrote his autobiography and recounted that while in his late teens he took a flatboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from his home in Indiana to New Orleans while employed as a hired hand. The son of the boat owner kept him company and the two went out on this new undertaking without any other helpers. After moving to Macon County, Illinois, Lincoln made an additional trip a few years later on another flatboat that went from Beardstown, Illinois, to New Orleans. He, John D. Johnston (his stepmother's son) and John Hanks were hired as laborers by Denton Offutt to take a flatboat to New Orleans. They were to join Offutt at Springfield, Illinois. In early March 1831, the boys purchased a large canoe and traveled south on the Sangamon River. When they finally found him, they discovered Offutt had failed to secure a contract for a freight trip in Beardstown. Thus, purchasing the large canoe was an unnecessary expense. They then tried to cut their losses and worked for Offutt for twelve dollars per month cutting timber and building a boat at the Old Sangamon town (fifteen miles northwest of Springfield) on the Sangamon River. The new boat carried them to New Orleans based upon the original contract with Offutt. As William Horman first wrote, \\"necessity is the mother of invention.\\" Before Offutt's flatboat could reach the Illinois River, it got hung up on a milldam at the Old Sangamon town. As the boat was sinking, Lincoln took action, unloading some cargo to right the boat, then drilling a hole in the bow with a large auger borrowed from the local cooperage. After the water drained, he replugged the hole. With local help, he then portaged the empty boat over the dam, and was able to complete the trip to New Orleans. At the age of 23, Lincoln started his political career in New Salem. Near the top of his agenda was improvement of navigation on the Sangamon River. Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William H. Herndon, also reports an additional incident at the time: a boat Lincoln was on got stranded on a shoal; the boat gradually swung clear and was dislodged after much manual exertion. This event, along with the Offutt's boat/milldam incident, prompted Lincoln to start thinking about how to lift vessels over river obstructions and shoals. He eventually came up with an idea for inflatable flotation. Called \\"Buoying Vessels Over Shoals,\\" Lincoln envisioned a system of waterproof fabric bladders that could be inflated when necessary to help ease a stuck ship over such obstacles. When crew members knew their ship was stuck, or at risk of hitting a shallow, Lincoln's invention could be activated, which would inflate the air chambers along the bottom of the watercraft to lift it above the water's surface, providing enough clearance to avoid a disaster. As part of the research process, Lincoln designed a scale model of a ship outfitted with the device. This model (built and assembled with the assistance of a Springfield, Ill., mechanic named Walter Davis) is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. After reporting to Washington for his two-year term in Congress (beginning March 1847), Lincoln retained Zenas C. Robbins, patent attorney. Robbins most probably had drawings done by Robert Washington Fenwick, his apprentice artist. Robbins processed the application, which became patent No. 6,469 on May 22, 1849. However, it was never produced for practical use. There are doubts as to whether it would have actually worked: It \\"likely would not have been practical,\\" stated Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the National Museum of American History, \\"because you need a lot of force to get the buoyant chambers even two feet down into the water. My gut feeling is that it might have been made to work, but Lincoln's considerable talents lay elsewhere.\\" About that time, Lincoln took his son Robert Todd to the Old Patent Office Building model room to view the displays, sowing one of the youngster's fondest memories. Lincoln himself continued to have a special affinity for the site. Patent Lincoln's patent drawings for patent No. 6,469 The registered patent No. 6,469 starts, Lincoln's patent ends with this claim, Lincoln's reflections on patents Lincoln's exposure to the patent system, as an inventor and as a lawyer, engendered deep beliefs in its efficacy. In the United States, patent law has a constitutional foundation, was supported by the country's founders, and was viewed as an indispensable engine for economic development. It led him to deliver two lectures on the subject, and was reflected in his approach as president. Lincoln had an attraction to machinelike accessories all his life, which some say was hereditary and handed down to him from his father's interest in labor- saving equipment. He made speeches on inventions before he became president. He said in 1858, Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship. Lincoln admired the patent law system because of the reciprocal benefits it furnished both the inventor and society. In 1859 he noted that the patent system \\". . . has secured to the inventor, for a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of new and useful things.\\" He described the discovery of America as the most important development \\"in the world's history,\\" followed second by the technology of printing and third by patent laws. Lincoln was himself a patent lawyer. reaper and twine binder in 1884 that was part of the McCormick Reaper patent case Early in his legal career, he won an unreported patent infringement case for the defendant, styled Parker v. Hoyt. A jury found that his client's waterwheel did not infringe the patent. His second largest professional fee came from successful participation in the \\"Reaper Case\\", McCormick v. Manny. He was co-counsel for the defendant with two aggressive and preeminent Pennsylvania patent attorneys, George Harding, and Edwin M. Stanton. Although Lincoln was prepared and well-paid, his co-counsel thought him too \\"ungainly and unpresentable to be allowed to participate\\" and present the argument. Although he was sent home unheard, Manny won the case in an opinion authored by Supreme Court Justice John McLean. (U.S. District Court of Ohio record) Upon Lincoln's taking office, he offered Harding the job of Commissioner of Patents, which was refused. He later offered the position of United States Secretary of War to Stanton, who accepted and served. Lincoln's final patent case was Dawson v. Ennis. It occurred between his presidential nomination and the election. His electoral triumph was juxtaposed with a litigation loss for his client. History of the model and letters patent The original 1846 patent drawing was discovered in the United States Patent Office director's office in 1997. Its only omission is the usually required inventor's autograph in the lower right corner. The Smithsonian Institution acquired about 10,000 patent models, including Lincoln's. The Engineering Collection includes about 75 maritime inventions; its Maritime Collections holds a replica, the original being deemed too fragile to loan.

Joanna was introduced as the younger half-sister of established character, Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies). She made her first on screen appearance on 26 May 1995. Following Davies' departure from Neighbours in 1996, rumours began that Harrison's character would be written out of the show. However, the actress signed a new long-term contract with Neighbours a few months later. In February 1997, producers decided to write Joanna out of the show. A reporter for the Daily Mirror said Harrison was written out due to rows with the producers over her poor acting. Joanna departed on screen on 15 April 1997. In 2005, Harrison was invited to return to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episode, but she did not appear. Joanna comes to Erinsborough to meet Annalise and introduce her to their father, Tony (Michael Carman). The sisters display different personalities; Annalise is high maintenance, while Joanna is uncomplicated and down to earth. The author of Neighbours: the first 10 years said Joanna was vacuous and branded her as bright as a glowworm. Writers for the Daily Mirror called her glamorous and said she was as just as stunning as her sister. Joanna and Annalise set up their own public relations company, but their first client turns out to be a con man. Joanna's next job was as an aerobics instructor. She followed this with a stint as co-owner of the Chez Chez bar. Joanna has a brief relationship with her sister's ex-fianc√©, Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan), before marrying Rob Evans (Graham Harvey). Joanna splits from Rob for a short time when she realises their marriage is loveless, but she decides to leave Erinsborough to reunite with him. Creation and casting When Harrison auditioned for a role on Neighbours, she was unaware the character she was reading for was Annalise Hartman's (Kimberley Davies) long lost sister, Joanna. Harrison told the Daily Mirror, \\"I was thrilled ‚Äì and doubly excited when I read the script that had me stealing her TV boyfriend. That was a real bonus.\\" The character of Joanna was Harrison's first major television role, following a successful modelling career. She relocated from Queensland to Melbourne for the part. Joanna was introduced as a replacement for Davies' character, but Harrison said she was determined \\"not to become a Kimberley clone.\\" The actress revealed it took ten months for her to feel comfortable in her new role and she said \\"When you start in a show like this, where everyone is very busy, you have to make your mark quickly. It's a case of sink or swim.\\" Following Davies' departure from the show, rumours circulated that Harrison and her character would be written out of the show. However, the actress signed a new long-term contract with Neighbours. In February 1997, producers told Harrison they were writing her out of Neighbours. Chris Hughes of the Daily Mirror reported Harrison was written out due to rows with the producers, who claimed her acting was not good enough. A show inside told Hughes, \\"She was called in to see the bosses and told that her acting was bad. They've always been harsh on models, but she had little ability and the role went to her head. When she started it was suggested she take acting lessons but after a while she stopped. She had decided she didn't need them any more. A lot of us felt she had become a prima donna.\\" In 2005, Harrison was invited back to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episode, but she did not appear. Development Characterisation Joanna is the daughter of Caitlin and Tony \\"Tarquin\\" Hartman (Michael Carman). She grew up in Yallingup. Joanna is made aware of her half-sister, Annalise, by Fiona Hartman (Suzanne Dudley) and she decides to go to Erinsborough to meet her. The BBC said the sister's have very different personalities. Joanna is \\"uncomplicated\\", while Annalise is high maintenance. Joanna is also \\"down to earth\\" and Annalise becomes jealous of her sister's stable home life. Joanna was more accepting of their father's job as a female impersonator, but Annalise became embarrassed by it. Of Joanna's personality, Josephine Monore, author of Neighbours: the first 10 years, said \\"Jo was even more vacuous than her blond looks would have you stereotype her. She was dizzy, forgetful and about as bright as a glowworm.\\"Monroe, Josephine, p.37 Fiona Parker of the Daily Mirror said Joanna was \\"glamorous\\", while a colleague called her a siren and said she was as \\"equally-stunning\\" as her sister. Tony Johnston, author of Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street, said Joanna was so \\"chirpy and over- helpful\\" that she drove everyone crazy.Johnston, Tony, p.185 In July 1996, Harrison commented on Joanna's development saying \\"When I started with Neighbours I came in as the little confused sister of Annalise but now Joanna Hartman is developing as a solid confident character.\\" She also said that she and Joanna were complete opposites. Harrison called her character \\"quite immature\\" and obsessed with men. Career When Tony gives Joanna and Annalise some money, the sisters decide to set up their own public relations company from their living room. Joanna and Annalise decide to combine their names and they call the company Anna-Jo Promotions. Inside Soap said the name was the best thing about the company. While Joanna has some experience promoting her father's act, Annalise does not know a lot about PR. However, the girls do attract a client, Roger Reynolds (Roger O'Connor), who asks Joanna and Annalise to get him some publicity for his magazine publishing business. Unbeknownst to the girls, Roger is a con man and he manages to cheat them out of everything they have. Inside Soap commented on the situation saying, \\"An experienced crook like Reynolds can sniff out easy targets like the Hartman sisters a mile away.\\" The police tell the girls what has happened and they go undercover to catch Roger. After Anna-Jo Promotions comes to an end, Joanna takes a job as an aerobics instructor. She is offered the position by the owner of the local fitness centre, Bruce Styles (Paul El Deir), who is impressed by her efforts. Joanna later becomes a co-owner of Chez Chez with Cheryl Stark (Caroline Gillmer), a role which prompted a writer for the Daily Record to comment \\"Joanna is thrilled to be part of Chez Chez - but proves to be anything but a silent partner.\\" Relationships Joanna begins dating Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan), which displeases Annalise as she was once engaged to him. Joanna becomes obsessed with Mark and he is forced to admit that their relationship is only a fling. Joanna eventually realises that the relationship is going nowhere and ends it. Joanna meets Rob Evans (Graham Harvey), a rich businessman, at an aerobics class. Rob sends Joanna a note and they get to know each other better, they then begin a relationship. Of Joanna and Rob, Harrison told Amanda Ruben of TV Week \\"It all happens very quickly, but Joanna is really drawn to Rob's energy and she thinks he's gorgeous. I think it's true love. She really does fall head over heels.\\" Joanna considers leaving Australia to work with her father in Asia, but when she realises she is in love with Rob, she turns the job down. Joanna worries about revealing her true feelings to Rob because she ruined her relationship with Mark by moving too quickly. She decides to tell him about the job offer to see if he feels the same way about her, but she starts to feel like she has waited for too long for a reply. A writer for Inside Soap said \\"Jo's really shocked at Rob's indifference to the thought of her leaving and, in typical Jo style, she breaks down and blurts out all her feelings.\\" Joanna flees from Rob in tears and prepares to leave and join her father abroad, but she then finds Rob on her doorstep begging for her hand in marriage. Joanna accepts his proposal and she shocks everyone when she reveals she is engaged to Rob after only knowing him for a short time. Joanna's visions of a \\"rosy future\\" are shattered when Rob reveals that he has been hiding something from her for a while. He explains that he had a vasectomy and cannot have children. Despite setting her heart on having a family, Joanna stays with Rob and their wedding is \\"a beautiful, lavish affair\\", though it does not go without a hitch. The gazebo that is being built for the ceremony is not finished in time and Joanna is not pleased with the dress Danni Stark (Eliza Szonert) has made for her. It is too revealing and not what Joanna wants at all. Joanna and Rob are married on 21 June 1996. Joanna leaves Rob when she realises their marriage is loveless, but she later decides to reunite with him. Storylines Joanna arrives in Erinsborough to meet Annalise Hartman. She reveals they are half-sisters, but Annalise does not believe her. She eventually realises Joanna is telling the truth and she tries to accept her. Annalise cancels her trip overseas to stay and get to know her sister. Joanna realises Annalise has not met their father, Tony, and she arranges for them to meet. Annalise is shocked that Tony is a female impersonator called \\"Tarquin Sequin\\" and Joanna becomes upset when her sister cannot see past her father's job. She begs Annalise to give him a chance, but Annalise is set against it as Tony had humiliated her in public. Joanna becomes desperate to get them to reconcile, as Tony plans to leave. She succeeds and Annalise makes friends with her father. Joanna then leaves with Tony. Joanna later returns to Erinsborough to spend more time with Annalise. The sisters become close and after reading an article Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) has written about their father, the girls get revenge on her. Joanna and Annalise go into business together and call their company Anna-Jo Promotions. Joanna moves into Number 24 and gets off on the wrong foot with landlady Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) and Cody Willis (Peta Brady). Joanna and Annalise's first client turns out to be a criminal and the police ask them to go undercover to catch him. Joanna begins dating Annalise's ex-fianc√©, Mark Gottlieb. Joanna worries Mark still has feelings for Annalise, but he convinces her she is the only girl he is interested in. Joanna begins to get obsessed with Mark and her friends became worried for her. When Mark tells her their relationship is just a fling, Joanna breaks down and realises she needs help. After her relationship with Sam Kratz (Richard Grieve) ends, Annalise leaves Erinsborough for good. Joanna is sad when she is left behind, but she helps Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engelman) get into a Performance Arts course at University and finds employment at the gym as an aerobics instructor. Joanna meets Rob Evans and he employs her as his personal trainer. They begin a relationship and Rob proposes to Joanna. Joanna asks Danni Stark to make her wedding dress, but she is horrified at the result. Joanna becomes difficult and unpleasant to be around and she later realises she has let the wedding plans get on top of her. She asks Danni to make her another dress and she is delighted when Rob arranges for Tony to return for the wedding. Following the wedding, Joanna becomes disappointed in married life. She dislikes Rob going away on business all the time and she decides to become a silent partner in Chez Chez. Rob returns and tells Joanna they are moving to Europe because of his job. Joanna says goodbye to her friends and leaves. Joanna returns a few months later and announces she and Rob have broken up. Luke Handley (Bernard Curry) allows Joanna to move into Number 30. She goes on a date with Malcolm Kennedy (Benjamin McNair), but he realises they have nothing in common and he tells her he is not interested in pursuing a relationship with her. Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) purchases Joanna's shares in Chez Chez and Joanna decides to invest in Debbie Martin's (Marnie Reece-Wilmore) coffee shop. Joanna also turns her attentions to Lou's used car business. Joanna and Rob's love letters are made public and Joanna decides to contact her husband. The next day, Joanna leaves Erinsborough to reunite with Rob. Reception For her portrayal of Joanna, Harrison earned a nomination for Most Popular New Talent at the 1996 Logie Awards. At the Inside Soap Awards, Harrison was nominated for Best Newcomer, while Joanna was nominated for Biggest Bitch in Soap. The BBC said Joanna's most notable moment was \\"Her marriage to Rob Evans.\\" Matthew Clifton, writing for entertainment website Heckler Spray, included Joanna in his list of \\"The Best Ever Mid-90s Neighbours Characters\\". He said \\"Annalise's mental, annoying sister had really strange facial features and once lived under her desk in Lassiters, like George Costanza in Seinfeld.\\" Sue Malins of the Daily Mirror said Annalise and her \\"bubbly\\" sister Joanna turned up the temperature by having relationships with the same man. Andrew Mercado branded Joanna \\"a blonde-bombshell-in-training.\\"Mercado, Andrew, p.222 Discussing Joanna and Rob, a reporter from Soap World wrote \\"these two wed in haste and had lots of ups and downs.\\" References External links * Joanna Hartman at the BBC * Joanna Hartman at Neighbours.com Neighbours characters Television characters introduced in 1995 Fictional bartenders Fictional female businesspeople Fictional people from Victoria (Australia) Fictional personal trainers Female characters in television ","title":"Joanna Hartman"},{"id":"34160387","title":"Pauline Wong"},{"id":"34160399","text":"Riccardo Dane Chanase (October 21, 1894 - July 15, 1975) was an American painter and printmaker.

Born into an elite Sephardic Jewish family in Morocco, Levy migrated to Gibraltar as a child and later established himself as a slave merchant in the Caribbean with extensive business dealings in England, Europe, and the Americas. After amassing a fortune, Levy ended his business career in favor of a life centered on philanthropic causes. In 1821 he immigrated to the Florida Territory in the United States where he established a large agrarian refuge for Jews who were suffering under repression in Europe. Although the number of Jews fell far short of expectations, at least five Jewish families made their way to Levy's Pilgrimage Plantation--located in north central Florida--making this the first agrarian Jewish settlement in the United States (1822-1835). The plantation was destroyed by fire during the onset of the Second Seminole War (1835-1842). Levy, a slaveholder, was also unusual in his advocacy of the gradual emancipation of slaves. He wrote \\"A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery\\" while in London in 1828, achieving celebrity during the height of the antislavery campaign. Even more importantly, Levy was instrumental in leading an unprecedented series of inter-religious debates in elite venues where he challenged Christians to end antisemitism. Since Jews had never before entered the public sphere in England, and certainly never openly questioned the status quo, these public meetings created a furor in London. Widespread international press coverage referred to these protests as the \\"Extraordinary Movement of the Jews.\\" Levy can now be seen as a Jewish social activist without parallel in early nineteenth-century Britain and America. Life Moses Levy was the son of Eliahu Ha-Levi ibn Yuli (death circa 1800), a courtier and royal merchant, and his wife, Rachel, one of three wives in a plural marriage. The Ibn Yuli family were √©lite Sephardi Jews who served as court officials and advisers to the sultans of Morocco. In 1790, the family fled to Gibraltar, where Moses Levy grew to young adulthood. At eighteen Levy‚Äîhaving dropped the Yuli surname‚Äîleft the region for the Danish Virgin Islands, where he established himself as a leading merchant and shipper in Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas. In 1803 he married Hannah Abendanone (1786‚Äì1872), the daughter of a local merchant, David Abendanone, and his wife, Rachel. They had four children. The youngest, David Levy Yulee (1810‚Äì1886), became the first Jew elected to the United States Senate, representing Florida. Moses Levy's firm of Levy & Benjamin pursued an extensive trade throughout the Caribbean. Philip Benjamin, one of his partners, was the father of Judah P. Benjamin, future Confederate Secretary of State. Levy eventually left this firm and ran his own business centered in San Juan, Puerto Rico and then Havana, Cuba. His friendship with Alejandro Ramirez, the superintendent of Cuba and the Floridas, was influential in expanding Levy's business horizons. At one time Levy supplied General Pablo Morillo's massive expeditionary forces in Venezuela with food, munitions, and other supplies. Influenced by evangelical culture, in 1816 Levy underwent a spiritual epiphany, an event that was at least partially attributable to a rancorous and long-failing marriage. After a rare, formal divorce granted by the Danish king (1818) Levy abandoned a flourishing business in favor of a life devoted to what he called the \\"sacred cause\\" of reform. His plans included an \\"asylum\\" for Jews who were then suffering extensive abuse in post-Napoleonic Europe. His colonization attempts in frontier East Florida, entirely self-funded, were beset by difficulties and in 1825 he departed for England, where he hoped to elicit support. (To be expanded, please be patient.) In London, Levy took on an activist role during 1827‚Äì28 and his writing and oratory became well known in the metropolis. His initial celebrity can be largely attributed to the enthusiastic backing of influential Christians‚Äîparticularly the editors of the evangelical newspaper The World as well as the leadership of the Philo-Judaean Society. Philo- Judaeans were ostensibly devoted to the material and educational welfare of London's impoverished Jews but nevertheless harbored conversionist goals. In contrast Levy sought tangible relief for his fellow Jews, most of whom dwelt in the East End slums, but steadfastly rejected the tactics of conversion. Striking an unprecedented diplomatic balance, Levy was able to rise within the reform ranks and still retain a staunchly Jewish persona. His prominent Philo- Judaean supporters included the radical evangelical and former Tory MP Henry Drummond; the decorative glass manufacturer Apsley Pellatt; and the Anglican clergyman Hugh McNeile (also M'Neile). Levy's first major address before the organization, held at Freemasons' Hall in May 1827, stressed the commonality of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, condemned antisemitism, and challenged Christians to end \\"the persecution of contempt.\\" (The World (London), 20 June 1827) Positive press coverage presented Levy as an admired orator, philanthropist, and promoter of inter-faith relations. Millennialist zeal contributed to Levy's notoriety and some viewed his actions as \\"extraordinary signs of the times\\" and proof that \\"something most singular is approaching\\" (ibid., 9 January 1828). Previously any public notice among Anglo-Jewry was purposely avoided and debates with gentiles were considered anathema‚Äîa passive strategy that emerged after centuries of Old World oppression. Levy's agenda for reform also included the gradual abolition of slavery and he frequently expounded the subject in England. His pamphlet A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery, Consistently with the Interests of All Parties Concerned (1828) was praised for addressing pragmatic issues that other abolitionists avoided. Despite the publication's anonymity Levy's authorship was well known in reform circles. His anti-slavery philosophy evolved from his background as a sugar planter in the New World‚Äîpractical experience that few abolitionists could equal. From his perspective immediate emancipation would be calamitous since blacks were not only psychologically injured by slavery but were also hampered by illiteracy. Consequently Levy‚Äîan actual slave-owner in Florida‚Äîadvocated universal education for slave children, a system that would stress reading, writing, and science fundamentals as well as farming skills. Freedom would be awarded at the age of twenty-one and each family would be given land for cultivation. Levy envisaged a \\"united association\\" of philanthropic businesses that would put his tenets into practice. Despite Levy's rather utopian outlook his ideas received wide recognition. The London Literary Chronicle recommended his anti-slavery pamphlet \\"to the serious attention of the legislature and the public\\" (cited in The World, 20 August 1828); The World devoted a lengthy column to the treatise, in which the author's 'great benevolence of soul, and deep and enlightened piety' (ibid., 9 July 1828) were particularly stressed; and a new anti-slavery society, organized at Salvador House, Bishopsgate, London, took up Levy's far-ranging abolitionist creed. Levy chaired a series of impassioned and much publicized \\"public meetings of the Jews\\" held at the City of London Tavern. These meetings condemned Jewish persecution in Russia‚Äîthen one of Britain's prime military allies. He was a prolific writer, contributing articles and letters to the newspapers almost daily. His Letters Concerning the Present Condition of the Jews, being a Correspondence between Mr. Forster and Mr. Levy(1829) was published in London with an evangelical co- author, John Forster of Southend. Levy can be seen as a Jewish social activist without parallel in early nineteenth-century Britain. His outsider status allowed for a certain freedom of action, but his transnational standing also marginalized his contributions after he returned to the United States in the summer of 1828. Full recognition has only been recently accorded to him by historians. Upon his return to the slave-holding south, Levy curtailed his abolitionism. But other elements of his reform agenda could be safely broached, and from his residence in St. Augustine, Florida, he led the first campaign for free education in public schools in the territory. His appointment as education commissioner by the governor (1831) reflected a growing acceptance of Levy's call to action. However, the onset of the Second Seminole War (1835) and the resultant devastation put an end to his reform career‚Äîas well as his communal farming settlement, Pilgrimage‚Äîand, in combination with legal challenges to his extensive land holdings, caused great economic hardship. By 1849 Levy had regained much of his former wealth after his claim to nearly 100,000 acres was validated by state and federal courts. Levy died while on a summer excursion to the White Sulphur Springs resort in Virginia on 7 September 1854. Note: Moses Levy never commissioned a portrait of himself and so, unfortunately, there is no visual likeness available.

The aircraft had an unconventional design: it had a set of delta wings, in front of which were a set of short conventional wings. It had a fixed front landing gear and the cockpit was further back than usual. Design and development In 1935 the prolific aircraft designer Roland Payen developed a radical tandem-wing configuration aircraft which he dubbed the \\"Fl√©chair\\" (Arrow). The PA 22/1R was to be powered by an early form of ramjet known as the Melot 1R engine. This design was to participate in the 1939 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe air race. Unfortunately the Melot engine was not able to develop the required thrust and the 1939 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe was cancelled due to the start of World War II.Payen PA-22 / PA-112, All-Aero.com. Retrieved April 11, 2015 Payen redesigned the aircraft around a Regnier 180 hp 6B-01 six-cylinder, air- cooled inverted in-line engine, which was designated PA 22/2, and was completed in 1939. While being tested in the wind tunnel at Chalais-Meudon (Paris), the Germans invaded France and confiscated it. The German occupation forces were intrigued by the design and completed the wind tunnel testing. Redesignated the PA 22 V5, painted in German colors and coded BI+XB, the aircraft was transferred to Villacoublay. In October 1942 Payen's test pilot Jacques Charpantier, completed the first flight. A flight test program was started, but before it was completed Payen convinced the German authorities that modifications were necessary and had the prototype returned to his factory at Juvisy. Improvements including a variable-pitch propeller and supplementary fuel tanks were started but in 1943 an Allied air raid on the Juvisy railway yard also struck the factory, destroying the PA 22.

He is best known for providing public diplomacy services, political consultancy, and barbecue catering to the North Korean government. Early life and education Egan is the son of Walter Egan, a former U.S. Army bomb disposal technician who served in the Korean War and later went to work as a tar roofer. He grew up in Fairfield, New Jersey. According to Egan, he mowed lawns for drug trafficker and securities fraudster Bobby Vesco and was, at one point, approached by the FBI to become an informant. As a youth, Egan experienced problems with drug addiction. He graduated in 1976 from West Essex High School. Career Cubby's In 1982, after several years of working as a roofer, Egan opened Cubby's, a roadside barbecue restaurant in Hackensack, New Jersey. Egan partnered with longtime friend, Leonard Wehrle, on the establishment, as well as Wehrle's parents. In 1996 Egan filed a civil rights lawsuit against the City of Hackensack, claiming police officers had attempted to extort free food and money from his restaurant through a protection racket. Though his claims were ultimately dismissed, the city settled a separate claim Egan had made against police for $300,000. Egan continued to be a strong critic of city police chief Ken Zisa. When Zisa was arrested for insurance fraud in 2010, Egan programmed Cubby's electronic billboard to scroll ‚ÄúPOLICE CHIEF KEN ZISA ARRESTED FOR FRAUD HASTA LA¬¨VISTA CHIEF ZISA GOOD BYE GOOD RIDDANCE\\". Egan was offered the opportunity by the North Korean government to open a branch location of Cubby's in the DPRK in the mid-1990s but declined the offer. Diplomacy According to Egan, Cubby's became popular with Vietnamese diplomats assigned to that nation's permanent mission to the United Nations in the 1980s. During this time Egan was still living with his parents. In his autobiography, Egan says that his father at one point discovered, in his room, communist literature given to him by staff of the Vietnamese delegation and expelled him from the family home. Egan's interactions with Vietnamese officials continued through the 1980s and, in 1990, he traveled to Vietnam for the first time. Two years later Vietnamese diplomat Le Quang Khai attempted to defect to the United States. Though the U.S. government declined his request for asylum, Egan provided housing to the diplomat and helped generate enough negative publicity that the decision was reversed. In the early 1990s, Egan was introduced to members of the North Korean delegation to the United Nations by his Vietnamese contacts. According to Egan, the North Koreans requested he help them improve their reputation and standing within the United States. Egan arranged for the diplomats to attend a New York Nets game and to tour the team's locker room. Later, during the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Egan catered for the DPRK women's soccer team and also attempted to secure a sponsorship for the team with a sports drink manufacturer. Egan's relationship with the DPRK delegation became increasingly cordial and he began to frequently organize hunting and fishing trips for North Korean diplomats. Egan traveled to North Korea in 1994 and, again, in 1996. To provide cover for the trips, he was appointed ‚Äì by the DPRK government ‚Äì president of a non-existent entity known as the USA-DPRK Trade Council. In 2002 Egan contacted the New York Times at the behest of the DPRK mission to arrange an exclusive interview with North Korean ambassador Han Song Ryol, about that country's nascent nuclear weapons program. Egan also arranged, via a friend who was an oral surgeon, for a secure operating theater for Han when the ambassador needed to have a dental operation. During this time he made additional trips to the DPRK and offered advice on negotiating with the United States to the North Korean government, though the seriousness with which this advice was considered has been a matter of dispute. According to Egan, in addition to providing political advice and catering services to the North Korean UN delegation, he has also regularly collected information about DPRK diplomatic staff for U.S. intelligence agencies. Following the death of Kim Jong-il, Egan advised North Korean officials against the elevation of Kim Jong-un to a higher leadership post in the DPRK. He later opined that \\"I think His Excellency [Kim Jong-il] will be remembered as someone who opened the door to the West, and that‚Äôs something we didn‚Äôt have under his father\\". =Other contacts= According to Egan, he was also friends with Nizar Hamdoun, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations under Saddam Hussein; Hamdoun and Egan's daughters reportedly took karate lesson together. =Criticism= Jack Pritchard, a former staff member at the National Security Council who has been involved in negotiations in which Egan has participated, has criticized him for \\"inserting himself into affairs of state ‚Äì in the diplomacy and negotiations\\". According to Pritchard, he stopped associating himself with Egan after he learned Egan had been taping their conversations, a claim which Egan has confirmed. Egan himself claims he has been threatened \\"repeatedly\\" by the U.S. government with prosecution under the Logan Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act. Writing In 2010 Egan co- wrote Eating with the Enemy with Kurt Pitzer. The book, which details his diplomatic maneuvers, was published in 2010. Eating with the Enemy was optioned to HBO and turned into a screenplay by Pat Healy. James Gandolfini, who had been slated to star in the movie, died before production could begin and work on the movie was suspended. Personal life John McCreary, a former U.S. Senate committee staffer who once interviewed Egan, has described him as friendly and generous and said \\"he just makes friends easily\\".

Early legal career Voros served as general counsel to Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho from 1978 to 1981, leaving that position to clerk for Dallin H. Oaks of the Utah Supreme Court. He practiced commercial litigation with the Salt Lake City law firm of Prince, Yeates & Geldzahler, and later at the firm of Poole & Associates. Voros joined the Criminal Appeals Division of the Utah Attorney General's Office in 1991 and worked as Division Chief of the Criminal Appeals Division from 1999 until he was appointed to the bench in 2009. During his time in the Attorney General's Office, Voros taught appellate advocacy at the S.J. Quinney College of Law for ten years, receiving the Peter W.

Judicial career Voros was appointed to the Utah Court of Appeals by Governor Gary Herbert in December 2009. His appointment came after the retirement of Judge Judith Billings, who had been on the court since its creation in 1987. Of his appointment, Herbert stated, \\"Fred brings a great deal of knowledge and experience to the Utah Court of Appeals. He has significant experience in all areas of the law, especially at the appellate level, and will be a good complement to the six sitting judges.\\" Along with Utah Court of Appeals Judge Stephen L.

Oltmanns, 2012 UT App 230, 285 P.3d 802http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/appopin/fire_insurance081612.pdf Judge Voros wrote a concurring opinion discussing the propriety of citing Wikipedia as a source of authority in court opinions. The case dealt with the interpretation of the words \\"jet ski\\" in an insurance contract. Looking to Wikipedia and several dictionaries, the majority opinion concluded that the term \\"jet ski\\" was ambiguous and could refer either to all personal watercraft or only those of the stand-up variety. Judge Voros discussed the pitfalls and promise of using Wikipedia in such situations. Ultimately, he endorsed the use of Wikipedia to determine the common usage of words, with the caveat that the source should be viewed critically to guard against manipulation of Wikipedia entries for purposes of litigation.

Peterson, who co-founded the firm with Allred in 1984, owned 36.37% of the company. The parties could not reach an agreement on a fair value of the shares and took the case to trial. Experts for both parties each determined values for Peterson's shares with Peterson's expert valuing them at $505,625 and the expert of the remaining shareholders valuing them at $224,639. The court determined a \\"fair value\\" of $459,000. Both sides appealed. Judges McHugh, Voros and Roth affirmed the court's decision.

Their ancestors migrated to the central Appalachian region in the late 18th to mid 19th centuries, with origins likely in colonial Virginia, similar to other migrants on the frontier.Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians Website The Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians were recognized by name for their civic contributions by a resolution of the Kentucky General Assembly. In June 2013 the Pine Mountain Indian Community, LLC, announced that the Ridgetop group would be renamed as the Ridgetop Shawnee, to serve as the heritage arm of this nonprofit organization. Within this new management structure, the Ridgetop Shawnee will concentrate on preservation and protection of the heritage of the region. The Pine Mountain Indian Community will take the lead with regard to economic development and community development in Southeastern Kentucky. Historical claims In the late 18th to mid-19th centuries, many multiracial families migrated to southwestern Virginia; extreme southeastern Kentucky, particularly Harlan County; and northeastern Tennessee. In the 1870 federal census for Harlan County, Kentucky, for instance, numerous families were classified as Indian. Families with the surnames of Sizemore, Callahan, Eldridge, and Cole have had a tradition of Native American ancestry, as well as European and African. Often such families moved to the frontier for less expensive land, as well as to avoid racial caste discrimination in more settled areas of slave states. Remnant members of tribes intermarried with their neighbors and a multiracial group of settlers formed. Beginning in 1913, the Pine Mountain Settlement School educated some of the local children in Harlan County. For nearly 20 years it operated as a progressive boarding school for elementary age children in the Appalachian region; in the 1930s, it shifted to operate as a boarding high school. Modern achievements Since the late 20th century, the Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe have worked to strengthen and preserve Native American traditions and culture. They contributed to passage of local ordinances that prohibit digging, or artifact hunting, on county and city lands. One such ordinance was passed by the Harlan County, Kentucky fiscal court in 2006. The only such ordinance in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it has decreased illegal artifact hunting and helped preserve prehistoric sites. The Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians were instrumental in the creation of the Harlan County Native American Site Protection Office. The group members work with state, city and county officials to protect Native American cultural resources in Eastern Kentucky. They gained agreement from the city of Ashland, Kentucky to put a protective fence around prehistoric earthworks in a park; the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Indian Mounds in Central Park. In addition, the tribe has developed a database of persons documented as Native Americans in southeastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia and northeastern Tennessee, to make it easier for other persons to trace their ancestry. By December 2011, the Kentucky Native American Databank held basic genealogical data for more than 1,000 names; it is hosted on the free genealogy site, Rootsweb.William Shackleford, \\"Kentucky Native American Databank\\", Rootsweb, accessed 15 January 2012 The tribe is seeking to preserve the Shawnee language, a Central Algonquian language that was traditional for many of its ancestors. Today it is spoken primarily by people of the Shawnee Nation in Oklahoma. In 2009 and 2010, the State House of the Kentucky General Assembly recognized the Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians by passing, unopposed, House Joint Resolutions 15 or HJR-15 in 2009 and HJR-16 in 2010. These acknowledged civic contributions of the group by this name: their long history in the state, their efforts to preserve Native American heritage, as well as to help its elderly and young people. Membership The Ridgetop Shawnee require that prospective members prove documented descent from multiracial settlers in the region from 1790‚Äì1870, and also have Y-DNA or MtDNA showing direct-line Native American ancestry. Y-DNA and or MtDNA may be used only to show descent from individuals who are documented as eligible for enrollment.Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians, Official Website In 2012 the Ridgetop Shawnee began the Express Enrollment program for descendants of several family lines of mixed-Native American heritage, who have been well- documented as migrating to Southeastern Kentucky, Northeastern Tennessee, and Southwestern Virginia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. These families and lines are: Sizemore (KY); Fields (KY, VA); descendants of Hawkins Bowman (KY, VA); descendants of Ezekiel Bennett (KY, TN); descendants of John Cole (KY, VA); and descendants of Porter Jackson (KY, VA). In June 2012, the tribe limited new enrollment to individuals who qualified to use Express Enrollment. Historical Shawnee people Europeans reported encountering Shawnee over a widespread geographic area. The earliest mention of the Shawnee may be a 1614 Dutch map showing the Sawwanew just east of the Delaware River. Later 17th-century Dutch sources also place them in this general location. Accounts by French explorers in the same century usually located the Shawnee along the Ohio River, where they encountered them on forays from Canada and the Illinois Country.Charles Augustus Hanna (1911) The Wilderness Trail, esp. chap.

Its goal is to preserve and spread miller knowledge and skills to ensure the availability of enough millers who can responsibly operate all functional windmills in Frisia. For this purpose it offers a volunteer miller training program. Furthermore, it organises the Frisian mills day, excursions and together with De Fryske Mole () publishes a quarterly magazine De Utskoat .  History  The Gild Fryske Mounders (Frisian Guild) was founded in 1975 when it broke away from the Gilde van Vrijwillige Molenaars (), mostly out of discontent with the education and exam procedures of the Gilde van Vrijwillige Molenaars (Dutch Guild) and the exam committee of De Hollandsche Molen. After some years of internal turmoil and discussion with the Dutch Guild it became clear that consensus could not be reached and the Frisian Guild existed independently with its own training program and exam. The number of members gradually increased from 30 at the start to 150 in 1994 though with a constant worry about the low number of millers in training. In 1998 a merger was attempted between the two volunteer miller guilds. The Frisian Guild merged with the Frisian branch of the Dutch Guild and all Frisian diplomas were converted to Dutch certificates. In the end disagreement about the contents of education program and the exam procedures turned out to be too great and in 2003 the Frisian Guild became independent again.  Volunteer miller training  On average half a day per week prospective millers are taught the theory and practice of operating a windmill by a miller at an appointed training mill. The training takes at least one and a half years (though often longer) so the apprentice miller experiences all types of weather common in the Netherlands. The examination committee consists of the teaching miller and two independent experienced millers. The volunteer miller certificates of the Frisian and Dutch guilds are not officially recognised. There are plenty of active millers without a certificate, however mill organisations do often require it.

These roads are now either parts of other routes or no longer carry a route number. __TOC__ Highway 8 South Dakota Highway 8 was one of only two single digit state highway numbers known to be used in South Dakota. It was a state route across north central and northwest South Dakota, generally following what is now South Dakota Highway 20. The first designation of this route, in 1926, was South Dakota Highway 18. By the late 1920s, U.S. Highway 18 was established across southern South Dakota. The existence of two highway 18's was corrected around 1935, when the northern highway was redesignated as South Dakota 8. This number remained in use until the late 1960s, when SD 20 was extended west across the Missouri River, absorbing the SD 8 alignment. Highway 9 South Dakota Highway 9 was a designation that was used twice. This road went from Minnesota west to Sioux Falls. When the U.S. highway system was implemented in 1926, th road was designated as part of U.S. Highway 16. After a short period of dual signage, the SD 9 designation was dropped. South Dakota Highway 9 was a short state route in Marshall County. It was one of only two known single digit state highway numbers used in South Dakota. When highways were first numbered in the 1920s, this route was the northern end of South Dakota Highway 25. Around 1935, that route was realigned east from Britton to what is now South Dakota Highway 27. The old route became Highway 9, and linked up with the corresponding North Dakota Highway 9. SD 9 was dropped around 1950, and is currently unnumbered. Highway 12 South Dakota Highway 12 was a state route that ran across north central and northeast South Dakota. South Dakota 12 was one of the numbers assigned to the Glacier Trail. In 1926, U.S. Highway 12 was implemented, and ran 15 or to the south (US 12 was South Dakota 16 before that). Because the two Highway 12 routes were so close, the state highway was redesignated as South Dakota Highway 10 in 1927. Highway 16 South Dakota Highway 16 was a state route running across much of northern South Dakota. South Dakota 16 was designated in the 1920s, as a number for the Yellowstone Trail across the state. When the U.S. highway system was implemented in 1926, this road was designated as part of U.S. Highway 12. After a short period of dual signage, the SD 16 designation was dropped. Highway 18 South Dakota Highway 18 was a state route located in northwest and north central South Dakota. South Dakota 18 was first designated in the mid-1920s, running from the Montana border to near Mobridge. Shortly afterward, U.S. Highway 18 was implemented across the southern portion of the state. The northern highway 18 was redesignated as South Dakota Highway 8 around 1935. It is currently part of South Dakota Highway 20. Highway 24 South Dakota Highway 24 was a state route located in west central and northwest South Dakota. When initially established in the mid-1920s, the western terminus of South Dakota 24 was at Whitewood, west of Sturgis. It traveled east along what is now South Dakota Highway 34 to near Marcus, then northward to Faith. This northward segment was shifted east around 1931, to what is now South Dakota Highway 73; it became part of the latter's alignment in 1936. Around 1940, the western terminus was pushed a bit further, to U.S. Highway 85. A branch of SD 24, called South Dakota Highway 24A, extended northwest from Whitewood to Belle Fourche. The mainline SD 24 was rerouted over this branch around 1948, to its new terminus at Belle Fourche. A further extension was made in the early 1950s west from Belle Fourche to the Wyoming border. Between 1957 and 1960, the route was eliminated by a westward extension of SD 34. Highway 24A South Dakota Highway 24A was a state route located in the northern Black Hills of South Dakota. SD 24A was implemented around 1940, as a branch off SD 24 to Belle Fourche. By 1948, the mainline South Dakota 24 was rerouted onto this alignment when U.S. Highway 14 was realigned. This route is currently part of South Dakota Highway 34. Highway 27 South Dakota Highway 27 (SD 27) was a state highway that existed in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of South Dakota. It was established in 1926 from SD 50, northeast of Tabor, to U.S. Route 18 (US 18), west of Olivet. By 1936, it was redesignated as part of SD 35\\\\. Highway 35 South Dakota Highway 35 was a state route located in southeast South Dakota. This route was established around 1935, as a renumbering of South Dakota Highway 27. At that time, SD 27's northern terminus was at U.S. Highway 18; SD 35 was extended north to South Dakota Highway 42. The route was deleted in 1976. The segment south of U.S. 18 became part of a split South Dakota Highway 25; the segment to the north is unnumbered. Highway 41 South Dakota Highway 41 was a state route located in eastern South Dakota. South Dakota 41 was the original designation of U.S. Highway 281 in the state. When assigned in the mid-1920s, SD 41 ran nearly the entire length of the state north to south. A gap existed between U.S. Highway 14 and South Dakota Highway 34 east of Wessington Springs; this was completed by 1929. When U.S. 281 was assigned in the early 1930s, it was routed along the SD 41 alignment between the North Dakota border and U.S. 14. SD 41 remained separate south from there, as U.S. 281 continued south via Huron and Mitchell. By 1933, this segment of U.S. 281 was moved onto SD 41 as well, southward to U.S. Highway 16 at Plankinton. Around 1936, the dual signage was dropped, and the northern terminus of SD 41 was located at Plankinton. No changes took place in the 1940s, however, in the early 1950s, another alignment change in U.S. 281 took over the remainder of SD 41, and the number was discontinued. Highway 54 South Dakota Highway 54 was a short state route in southeast Gregory County, South Dakota. South Dakota 54 was implemented around 1926 as part of the state highway network. Its western terminus was at South Dakota Highway 50 (present day U.S. Highway 18) at Bonesteel. It ran south and east through Fairfax to the Nebraska border. By 1935, it was pulled back to Fairfax, at the intersection with the new U.S. Highway 281. Around 1953, due to the pending flooding of its old alignment, U.S. 18 was rerouted south onto this route, and SD 54 was limited to a segment north of the border. This last segment was eliminated around 1960, when U.S. 281 was rerouted onto it. Highway 59 South Dakota Highway 59 was a state route in south central South Dakota. South Dakota 59 was implemented in 1927 as a renumbering of part of South Dakota Highway 63, which was truncated. Its northern terminus was at U.S. Highway 16 in Murdo, and traveled south via White River to Mission (South Dakota Highway 50, present day U.S. Highway 18). The southern terminus was extended to the Nebraska border north of Valentine, Nebraska, by 1929. Around 1932, U.S. Highway 183 was implemented along the entire alignment of SD 59. The dual signage was removed by 1935. The road became part of U.S. Highway 83 in the 1940s, when the alignments of U.S. 83 and U.S. 183 were swapped. Highway 298 South Dakota State Highway 298 served the former Black Hills Ordnance Depot at Igloo, in far southwest South Dakota (Fall River County). South Dakota 298 extended from the depot to South Dakota Highway 471 northeast of Igloo. It was decommissioned in 1998.

The ability to directly photoimage the printed layers means that the technology can provide the high line and gap resolution required by high frequency planar components.D. Stephens, P. R. Young, and I. D. Robertson, \\"Design and characterization of 180GHz filters in photoimageable thick-film technology\\", IEEE MTT-S Int. Microwave Symp. Dig., 2005, pp. 451‚Äì454.C. Y. Ng, M. Chongcheawchamnan, M. S. Aftanasar, I. D. Robertson, and J. Minalgience, \\"X-band microstrip bandpass filter using photoimageable thick-film materials\\", IEEE MTT-S Int. Microwave Symp. Dig., Vol. 3, 2002, pp. 2209‚Äì2212. It provides a feasible fabrication process to produce circuits operating at microwave and millimetre-wave frequencies. Circuits made using this technology meet the modern requirements for high density packaging, whilst yielding the high quality components required for very high frequency applications, including wireless communication, radar and measurement systems. This technology also enables both single-layer and multi-layer filters to be produced conveniently. Recent research workR.A. Tacken, D. Mitcan, and J. Nab, \\"Combining fine line photoimageable with multi-layer thick film for improved circuit density\\", CICMT Proceedings, 2017. has investigated the combination of conventional thick film and fine line photoimageable technologies, in order to accommodate fine pitch and high density applications on the ceramic substrates. Furthermore, previous workC.-M. Tsai, and K. C. Gupta, \\"A generalized model for coupled lines and its applications to two-layer planar circuits\\", IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory & Techniques, Vol. 40, No. 12, 1992. has shown that this technology is capable of realizing the circuit quality necessary for high performance microwave components.  Benefits of choosing this structure  Comparison of thick film processes for fine lineEdge coupled band-pass filters were chosen for this study as they are one of the most common and useful microwave and millimetre-wave planar components. The filter performance is based on the coupling between the resonant sections and controlled by the size of the gap.[2] T. C. Edwards, and M. B. Steer, Foundation of Interconnect and Microstrip Design, J. Wiley & Sons, 2000. This characteristic makes edge coupled band-pass filters very sensitive to fabrication errors. Another reason of choosing this structure in a multi-layer form is due to limitation on the structure when it has been fabricated on a single layer. The gap between the two resonant structures becomes very small and cannot easily be fabricated due to the limitations of low-cost fabrication technologies. In multi-layer circuits, the coupling between resonant sections is achieved by overlapping conductors which are separated by a thin dielectric layer. However, to some extent the problem of fabricating small gaps has been exchanged for that of achieving high alignment between the conductor layers. Normally a modern mask aligner will be needed to achieve the required degree of resolution.  Application  The target market for photoimageable thick film pastes is the thick film (hybrid) circuit and component industries plus LTCC and HTCC activities. The technology allows extremely fine lines and structures to be produced with minimal investment in a simple process and use of special paste materials. Most of the production steps needed are already used by the industry. Only two extra production steps are required. No extra clean room requirements are needed. No special lighting is required. No chemicals are required. This can be advantageous for sections of the thick film circuits community which would allow them to offer greater added value, fine line products to compete with other thick film, thin film and PCB technologies. * High Density Interconnect ** 15 Œºm line/20 Œºm space with high yield on alumina ceramic substrates. ** 30 Œºm line/40 Œºm space with 50 Œºm vias for multilayers. ** 20 Œºm lines/30 Œºm space within LTCC & HTCC structures. *RF and microwave (up to 200 GHz is reported) * Sensor elements (narrow conductors and windows in dielectric and MEMS with ceramic/dielectrics). 10 Œºm lines/15 Œºm spaces at 10 Œºm fired thickness are possible. * Components, such as fuses & inductors * Plasma displays and RF shielding on glass  Thick films for microwave applications  Advantages of 'conventional' thick film over thin film * Through hole metallisation easy for small holes * A range of resistors is possible * Low cost process technology * Added advantages of photoimageable thick film * Very fine lines with precise geometry, sharp edges * Low resistivity of fine lines  References   External links  * Aurel Fine Line Equipment, Manufacturer Electronics manufacturing ","title":"Photoimageable thick-film technology"},{"id":"34161174","text":"The Smith‚ÄìElisha House, sometimes known just as the Elisha House or the Christmas Tree House, is located on West Main Street (State Highway 82) in Aspen, Colorado, United States. It is a wood frame structure in the Queen Anne style built in the late 19th century. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is considered one of the best Queen Anne houses in the city. Eben Smith, its original owner, was a mine owner during Aspen's boomtown years who worked to improve mine safety. Mansor Elisha, its other titular owner, was an accidental owner of the Hotel Jerome who later became mayor. Since those times it has remained intact. Buildings and grounds The house is located on the north side of West Main, between North Second and North Third streets. The neighborhood, two blocks west of downtown Aspen, is primarily residential, with multiple-unit dwellings of more modern construction giving way to the older single-family houses of the city's West End. Terrain is level, midway between the slopes of Aspen Mountain to the south and the Roaring Fork River to the north. There is, in addition to the house, a barn and carriage house in the rear with a cupola on its cross-gabled roof. The barn is considered a contributing resource to the Register listing. A block to the north is the D.E. Frantz House, also listed on the Register. The Matthew Callahan Log Cabin, one of the few original such structures left in Aspen, is a block away on South Third Street, and Pioneer Park is to the northwest at the same distance. Both, too, are listed. The main house is a two-and-a-half-story wood frame structure on a stone foundation. It is irregular in plan and topped by several steeply pitched shingled gables, with a tall decorative chimney piercing the rear roof. The first story is sided in clapboard while the upper stories are done in shingles. A shed-roofed porch wraps around the southeast corner, where the main entrance is located, ending at a large projecting bay on the east facade. It is supported by turned posts with latticework between them at the upper ends and a simple balustrade at the deck. In front of it the steps are sheltered by a gabled hood with a shingled pediment supported by similar posts. A decorative wooden railing runs up them. At the second story the shingled section flares outward slightly at the bottom. Above the main entrance is a hip roofed balcony also supported by decorative wooden posts. It is topped by a small gabled dormer window on the attic level. Another dormer tops the projecting bay. Most windows on the house are one-over-one double-hung sash with plain wooden surrounds. In the dormers, and on the east facet of the projecting bay, the windows are paired. A large oculus with crossed muntins and keystones is in the western gable apex on the south (front) facade, above a triple window. Two paired casement windows with decorative patterned glass are on the second story just south of the projecting bay, the only windows on that side of the second story. History In the late 1880s, Aspen was booming. Its mines produced silver in quantity, selling primarily to the U.S. government, required by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to buy the metal to support the dollar. What had a decade earlier started as a primitive encampment of tents and log cabins was now a bustling settlement of almost 10,000 with luxury hotels and other amenities. Those who had grown rich from the boom built large houses for themselves in the city's West End. Eben Smith was one. His mines in Aspen were among many he owned or co-owned in the state, and he did a lot to improve safety in the industry. Around 1890 he erected the house in the then-popular Queen Anne style. Two years later he left the city. The Panic of 1893 ended the city's early growth. Congress repealed the Sherman Act to combat inflation. With the market no longer so sustained, the price of silver dropped and many mines became unprofitable and closed. Miners then went to work elsewhere. The houses that had been built fell vacant as the city entered a period now known as its \\"quiet years\\" when its population dwindled to ultimately less than a thousand by 1930. During this period, Mansor Elisha, a Lebanese immigrant, came to Aspen. He managed to thrive despite the economy, and in 1911 became the owner of the Hotel Jerome, the only hotel in the city left from the early years. He did well enough that he was able to buy Smith's house for his family, preserving it from the neglect which led many other old buildings from the 1880s in the city to burn or collapse. Elisha and his descendants owned or operated the Jerome for the next 50 years. During the latter half of that time, prosperity gradually began to return to Aspen as it developed into a ski resort and popular retreat for celebrities and corporate executives. The Aspen Skiing Company leased the hotel and let Laurence Elisha, Mansor's son, manage it until his death in 1968. His widow Svea sold the hotel but kept the house until her own death in the mid-1980s. At that time, her estate objected to its listing on the Register along with other properties in the city's multiple property submission, and it was not listed until 1989. The following year it won an award from Colorado Preservation for excellence in the adaptive reuse of a residential structure. It was remodeled and has been used as offices for several businesses since then.

He was previously a member of the Regional Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania (1963‚Äì73). He is a graduate of Columbia University (BA) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, MS & PhD (Geography). He served as a US Navy officer from 1956 to 1959. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and AAAS. He has been a fellow at the Russell Sage Foundation, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral and Social Sciences, and the Woodrow Wilson Center and has been a Guggenheim fellow. Wolpert is a nationally cited scholar in the fields of location theory, urban development, migration, public and social services, and the analysis of charity, philanthropy, and the nonprofit sector, and has testified before Congress about the regulation of philanthropy. He has challenged conservatives who advocate for charitable rather than public service approaches to social policy. Wolpert served as Vice President, then President of the Association of American Geographers and Vice President of the Regional Science Association and the American Geographical Society and was elected to the American Institute of Certified Planners. Wolpert's earliest research focused on testing social, behavioral, and economic theory based upon spatial data, productivity gaps related to environmental risk and imperfect information, the migration decision, spatial sampling, the relation between commuting and migration, siting and closing amenity and \\"nimby\\" facilities, and disaster evacuation, and the effects of sprawl on regional development. More recently, his studies concerned the nonprofit marketplace in cities, nonprofit service representation and saturation of neighborhoods, locational variations in generosity, distributional effects of foundations, the fiscal viability of nonprofits, and methods for planning and evaluating nonprofit organizations and foundations.

The two women allegedly lured Velazquez to their Pilsen home, where he was shot to death and his body was wrapped in a tarp and set on fire. Following the murder, the two teenagers gained national notoriety when they became fugitives from justice, although they were separately apprehended in 2002 after their story was broadcast on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted. They were each convicted of first-degree murder in 2004. Murder On June 6, 2000, Regina DeFrancisco called her boyfriend of three weeks, 22-year-old Oscar Velazquez, to her home. The sisters' friend Veronica Garcia was also at their home. According to Garcia, she had given Margaret her boyfriend's gun, a .38 caliber semi-automatic pistol, believing that the gun was to be used for armed robbery. Margaret reportedly used the gun to shoot Oscar Velazquez once in the back of the head, instantly killing him. Following the murder, Regina and Margaret reportedly robbed the victim, Oscar Velazquez, of $600. After that, the sisters drove Oscar's body in his Camaro Z28 to a vacant lot, where Regina used nail polish remover to ignite his body. An anonymous caller phoned 911 to report the fire, and after finding Oscar Velazquez's body in the fire, he called 911 again. The sisters tried to sell the Camaro, but were unsuccessful, so they abandoned the vehicle and set it on fire. Regina and Margaret were immediately questioned by police as suspects in the murder of Oscar Velazquez, but their stories did not match up. Before the sisters could be arrested for murder, both fled from the police. Captures After almost two years spent evading police, Margaret DeFrancisco was captured in Rockford, Illinois on March 24, 2002. An anonymous tip following a broadcast of America's Most Wanted led to her capture at an apartment complex where she was staying with relatives. She was arrested for and charged with the murder of Oscar Velazquez and for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. On October 18, 2002, Regina DeFrancisco was arrested in Dallas, Texas. Chicago FBI reported that she was taken into police custody following a traffic stop and high-speed chase. Like her sister Margaret, she was charged with murder and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. She was later extradited to Illinois to stand trial for the crimes. Trials Regina and Margaret DeFrancisco's trial began in July 2004. The women pleaded not guilty by reason of self-defense. Veronica Garcia was the star witness for the sisters' prosecution; she had cut a deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to the lesser charge of concealment of a homicide in exchange for a short prison sentence and her testimony. On the witness stand, Garcia claimed to have had no foreknowledge of the murder, and claimed that she provided her boyfriend's gun to the sisters, which she believed would be used in a robbery. Garcia maintained that she did not see Margaret DeFrancisco kill Oscar Velazquez, and testified that Velazquez was apparently armed, although neither the murder weapon nor Velazquez's weapon were found. Garcia's testimony was corroborated by prosecution witnesses Jessica Benitez, Luciana Macias, and Maria Constantino. Benitez testified that both sisters confessed to having killed Oscar Velazquez, and that Margaret had kicked the victim in the head \\"so he could die faster\\". Constantino testified that she saw Regina, Margaret, and Veronica Garcia loading Oscar Velazquez's body in the back of his Camaro, and stated that Regina had confessed to orchestrating the crime. On July 7, 2004, Margaret DeFrancisco was called to the witness stand. She maintained that she killed her sister's boyfriend in self-defense. She stated how Velazquez was angry because the sisters had tricked him out of $1,000, and that she shot him to protect Regina. Although Margaret also claimed that she did not remember the actual shooting. She also testified that she did not tell the initial officers the truth because \\"We would've got in trouble\\" and \\"If I told the truth, I would've been there longer\\". Regina DeFrancisco also took the stand at her trial. She stated that after coming out of her bedroom, Velazquez was in the living room shouting and cursing at her. She claimed that Velazquez pulled a gun on her, and that she was curled up in the fetal position begging for her life. She then stated that she heard a gunshot before seeing Margaret holding a gun. Lastly, Regina testified that it had been Veronica Garcia's idea to dispose of Velazquez's body. After six-and-a-half hours of jury deliberations, Regina DeFrancisco was found guilty of murder during an armed robbery. However, Margaret DeFrancisco's jury was unable to convict her. Reportedly, there was an 11 to 1 deadlock in favor of conviction, but one juror held out for acquittal. The alleged reason was that the juror could not believe how someone so young could commit murder. One day after Regina's conviction, Margaret was released from custody on bail to await retrial. The re-trial of Margaret DeFrancisco began in November 2004, four months after her first trial. In a repeat of Margaret's first trial, Veronica Garcia testified for the prosecution, giving the same testimony. However, after this trial, Margaret DeFrancisco was convicted of first-degree murder. Aftermath On September 9, 2004, Regina DeFrancisco was sentenced to 35 years in prison. On December 14, 2004, Margaret DeFrancisco was sentenced to 46 years in prison. Both women are incarcerated at the Logan Correctional Center. Each has filed appeals, but all have been unsuccessful. For her role in the murder, Veronica Garcia was sentenced to 5 years. She served her time and was released. The DeFrancisco's murder of Velasquez was dramatized on Deadly Women.

On April 17, 2009, head of the IMF Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression. \\"The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today.\\" The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronized by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries. The chief economist of the IMF, Dr. Olivier Blanchard, stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. \\"Long- term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the US, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression.\\" The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928-1929.The Telegraph (UK), 2010 Sept. 14, \\"IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis: America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned,\\" https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF- fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html In the United States Dow Jones Industrial Average figures for percentage lost in 1937-1943 vs 2008-2011 (based on initial 1937 and 2008 DJIA month end amount, respectively) Although some casual comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression have been made, there remain large differences between the two events. Actually, if the magnitude of initial shocks was the same in both cases, the recovery from the latest one would be earlier. The consensus among economists in March 2009 was that a depression was not likely to occur. UCLA Anderson Forecast director Edward Leamer said on March 25, 2009 that there had not been any major predictions at that time which resembled a second Great Depression: > \\"We've frightened consumers to the point where they imagine there is a good > prospect of a Great Depression. That certainly is not in the prospect. No > reputable forecaster is producing anything like a Great Depression.\\" Differences explicitly pointed out between the recession and the Great Depression include the facts that over the 79 years between 1929 and 2008, great changes occurred in economic philosophy and policy, the stock market had not fallen as far as it did in 1932 or 1982, the 10-year price-to-earnings ratio of stocks was not as low as in the 1930s or 1980s, inflation-adjusted U.S. housing prices in March 2009 were higher than any time since 1890 (including the housing booms of the 1970s and 1980s), the recession of the early 1930s lasted over three-and-a-half years, and during the 1930s the supply of money (currency plus demand deposits) fell by 25% (where as in 2008 and 2009 the Fed \\"has taken an ultraloose credit stance\\"). Furthermore, the unemployment rate in 2008 and early 2009 and the rate at which it rose was comparable to most of the recessions occurring after World War II, and was dwarfed by the 25% unemployment rate peak of the Great Depression. However, syndicated columnist and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Paul Craig Roberts claimed in a 2012 column that if all discouraged workers were included in U.S. unemployment statistics, the actual unemployment rate would be 22%, comparable to rates during the Great Depression. Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Paul Krugman predicted a series of depressions in his The Return of Depression Economics (1999), based on \\"failures on the demand side of the economy.\\" On January 5, 2009, he wrote that \\"preventing depressions isn't that easy after all\\" and that \\"the economy is still in free fall.\\" In March 2009, Krugman explained that a major difference in this situation is that the causes of this financial crisis were from the shadow banking system. \\"The crisis hasn't involved problems with deregulated institutions that took new risks... Instead, it involved risks taken by institutions that were never regulated in the first place.\\" On February 22, 2009, NYU economics professor Nouriel Roubini said that the crisis was the worst since the Great Depression, and that without cooperation between political parties and foreign countries, and if poor fiscal policy decisions (such as support of zombie banks) are pursued, the situation \\"could become as bad as the Great Depression.\\" On April 27, 2009, Roubini expressed a more upbeat assessment by noting that \\"the bottom of the economy [will be seen] toward the beginning or middle of next year.\\"'I Am Not Dr. Doom', Washington Post. On April 6, 2009 Vernon L. Smith and Steven Gjerstad offered the hypothesis \\"that a financial crisis that originates in consumer debt, especially consumer debt concentrated at the low end of the wealth and income distribution, can be transmitted quickly and forcefully into the financial system. It appears that we're witnessing the second great consumer debt crash, the end of a massive consumption binge.\\" In his final press conference as president, George W. Bush claimed that in September 2008 his chief economic advisors had said that the economic situation could at some point become worse than the Great Depression. A tent city in Sacramento, California was described as \\"images, hauntingly reminiscent of the iconic photos of the 1930s and the Great Depression\\" and \\"evocative Depression-era images.\\" The Austrian School of economics view is that the size of a bust is based, at least in part, on the size of the preceding credit boom. A check of debt levels prior and during the Great Depression shows debt levels prior to the Great Depression at about 200% of GDP, with a rise to about 300% due to massive government intervention to combat the Depression. The debt outstanding metric indicates that the Great Recession was not over by mid-2012 and would be worse than the Great Depression; only the first part of that projection turned out to be true by mid-2014. Current US debt levels are around 400% of GDP and well over the levels seen either before or during the Great Depression. According to economist Irving Fisher, the two dominant factors in a depression are over-indebtness to start with and deflation soon after. Fed policy to prevent deflation at all costs has been greatly influenced by Fisher's work. In the United Kingdom On 10 February 2009, Ed Balls, Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families of the United Kingdom, said that \\"I think that this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy.\\" On 24 January 2009, Edmund Conway, Economics Editor for The Daily Telegraph, had written that \\"The plight facing Britain is uncannily similar to the 1930s, since prices of many assets ‚Äì from shares to house prices ‚Äì are falling at record rates [in Britain], but the value of the debt against which they are held remains unchanged.\\" References  External links  * Barry Eichengreen; Kevin H O‚ÄôRourke (2010).

Blue light is an archaic signal, the progenitor of modern pyrotechnic flares. Blue light consists of a loose, chemical composition burned in an open, hand-held hemispherical wooden cup, and so is more akin to the flashpan signals of the Admiral Nelson era than the modern, encased signal flares, often launched by mortar or rifle and suspended by parachute. Widely used during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for signaling by the world's military forces, and for general illumination in the civilian sector, blue light was remarkable for its use of poisonous arsenic compounds (realgar and orpiment), which contributed to its replacement by safer flares in the early twentieth century. Confusion with blue-colored lanterns Blue light was famously mentioned in accounts of the H.L. Hunley, the Confederate submarine which became the first to sink an enemy vessel, the , on February 17, 1864, during the Civil War.Proceedings of the Naval Court of Inquiry on the Sinking of the Housatonic NARA Microfilm Publication M 273, reel 169, Records of the Judge Advocate General (Navy) Record Group 125J.N. Cardozzo, Reminiscences of Charleston (Charleston, 1866) p. 124. Google Book search Dec. 10, 2011 Such blue light has been repeatedly misidentified by authors and researchers of the Hunley story as a blue lantern, since they failed to realize the 1864 meaning of \\"blue light\\" as it was known to eyewitnesses who testified to its use during the battle between the Hunley and Housatonic.Noah Webster, International Dictionary of the English Language Comprising the issues of 1864, 1879 and 1884,ed. Noah Porter, p. 137 at www.archive.org/details/webstersinternat01webs Accessed Dec. 10, 2011 Pyrotechnic blue light was commonly used by the vessels of the Federal South Atlantic Blockading Squadron off of Charleston, South CarolinaReport of Lieutenant-Commander W.D. Whiting (commanding the USS Ottawa off Charleston, 22 January 1863); ORN I, 13, PP. 525-526 and would have been a familiar sight to both Union and Confederate soldiers and sailors. Recipes for blue light appear in early chemistry texts and often included antimony or copper compounds meant to add a blue color, but by the time of the American Civil War, standard military texts listed recipes for blue light which lacked any such coloring agent. While the generic moniker \\"blue light\\" was retained, the pyrotechnic signal was meant to burn with a vivid, white light. Modern authors have been confused by the generic name of blue light, and have imagined incorrectly that the signal which was seen during the Hunley - Housatonic encounter was blue. The oil lantern which archeologists at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center recovered from the Hunley submarine has a clear, not a blue, glass lens, further evidence which discounts the modern \\"blue lantern myth\\" of the Hunley. Blue light as made in 1864 has been reproduced according to the two recipes listed in period textsOrdnance Manual, p.307Benton, p.369 and has been tested with success over the same distances involved in the Hunley engagement. Decline Blue light has been obsolete for signaling since early in the twentieth century, but pyrotechnic lighting is still popular for celebratory fireworks displays, and its synonyms \\"Bengal light\\" and \\"Bengal fire\\" can still be found in modern pyrotechnic manuals. Such displays were also popular in nineteenth century civilian life: two hundred blue lights were used in the first illumination of Niagara Falls during the 1860 North American visit of the Prince of Wales. As a nickname \\"Blue Light\\" was a derisive nickname given to military officers of the 18th and 19th centuries, whose evangelical Christian zeal burned as brightly as its namesake signal, to the chagrin of those less ardent.Gareth Atkins, review of Evangelicals in the Royal Navy, 1775-1815: Blue Lights and Psalm-Singers by Richard Blake (review no. 799) accessed Dec. 24, 2011 at www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/799 During the American Civil War, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson carried the nickname \\"Old Blue Lights\\" because of his overt religiosity; the nickname is referenced in the lyrics of \\"Stonewall Jackson's Way\\" (penned circa 1862).

The TRPN gene was given the name no mechanoreceptor potential C (nompC) when it was first discovered in fruit flies, hence the N in TRPN. Since its discovery in fruit flies, TRPN homologs have been discovered and characterized in worms, frogs, and zebrafish. Structure A structure of NOMPC was published in 2017, solved using electron cryo- microscopy. X-ray crystallography studies of channel segments cloned from fruit flies and zebrafish have led to the hypothesis that multiple ankyrin repeats at TRPN's N-terminus are involved in the gating of the channel pore. Crystallography studies of TRPY1, a yeast TRP homolog, have shown that aromatic residues conserved across TRP family members, including TRPN, in the sixth transmembrane domain are critical to the gating mechanism as well. Function As a mechanoreceptor, TRPN responds to impinging mechanical forces. Studies in TRPN deficient adult fruit flies and larvae have shown that these null mutants have severe difficulty moving, which suggests a role for TRPN in proprioception. This hypothesis is further strengthened by immunostaining studies in fruit flies that have shown TRPN localization in the cilia of campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs in Johnston's organ. Further immunostaining studies in fruit flies have identified, with higher resolution techniques, that TRPN is localized at the distal end of motile mechanosensory cilia in Johnston's organ. However, TRPN is not required for transduction of mechanical stimuli in larvae or adult flies, suggesting that the TRPV channels nanchung and inactive may also serve a mechanosensory function. Studies in worms have shown that TRPN mutants have locomotion defects, as well as a decreased basal slowing response, which is a reduction in rate of motion that is induced by contact with a food source. This result further strengthens the hypothesis that TRPN is vital to proprioception. Electrophysiological studies of single channels in worms have shown that TRPN responds to mechanical stimuli and has a preference for sodium ions, although a complete ion selectivity profile has yet to be identified. Studies in zebrafish larvae have also shown that morpholino-mediated knockdown of TRPN function result in deafness as well as imbalance, suggesting a dual role in hearing as well as proprioception. Immunostaining studies in frog embryos have shown localization of TRPN at the tips of mechanosensory cilia in the lateral line, hair cells and ciliated epidermal cells, suggesting a role in a variety of mechanosensory functions. TRPN localizes to the kinocilia, not stereocilia, of amphibian hair cells, suggesting the presence of two distinct classes of mechanosensitive channel. TRPN has the capability of performing a variety of roles in mechanosensory systems. Genes Genomic data from a variety of organisms show that TRPN is present in most animals, but it is absent in all amniotes.. In most animals the number of ankyrin repeats is between 28 and 29. The following is a list of genes encoding TRPN organized by the organism in which they are found. Gene names are specific to the organism and to the way in which they were discovered, which is why the gene name may not explicitly be \\"TRPN\\".

A superstition associated with the Fairy Bridge is that passers-by must greet the fairies as they cross it; it is considered bad luck not to greet them. Superstitions A superstition is to greet the fairies (an English term for the Mooinjer Veggey (\\"Little People\\"); historically never called fairies or ferrish by the Manx and not of similar disposition to the English fairies) when crossing the Fairy Bridge; it is considered unlucky not to greet them. From the 1950s it was reportedly the custom to advise a visitor of the myth on the journey south from Douglas or north from the airport. This was timed so that one was required to say \\"Good morning Fairies!\\" just as the teller and his guest(s) crossed the Fairy Bridge. This would subsequently be repeated by the same or other tellers, leaving visitors perplexed as to the tellers' beliefs. Buses passing the Fairy Bridge make an automatic announcement before passing the bridge saying Please serve the Manx tradition, and say Hi Fairies as we cross the Fairy Bridge. Like many local superstitions on the Isle of Man, the Fairy Bridge myth is changing with the influx of new residents. It has always been a whimsical practice, never taken too seriously by residents, despite food writer A.A. Gill's repetition in London newspaper \\"The Times\\" of an urban myth that taxi drivers will stop if the passenger does not greet the fairies. Motorcycle racers and spectators at the annual TT and Manx Grand Prix races tend to take the ritual seriously, in most cases making a point of visiting the bridge before setting up for practice and the races. In an example of confirmation bias, mishaps and crashes are readily attributed to the fairies' displeasure; likewise lucky escapes. It has been suggested that the location was on the boundaries of the land of the nearby Rushen Abbey, and the greeting is a folk memory of crossing oneself at the sight of the crucifix marking the boundary of the monastery's land. This superstition may possibly have arisen at this location during the 19th century in response to the large number of tourists visiting the Island.

Approximately 200,000 barrels of crude oil were leaked into the ocean.\\"Wafra\\" . Incident News. Retrieved 23 December 2011.\\"Cape Agulhas, South Africa: Incident Summary\\" . Incident News. 27 February 1971. Retrieved 23 December 2011. The larger part of the ship was refloated, towed out to sea, and then sunk by the South African Air Force to prevent further oil contamination of the coastline. Grounding and sinking Wafra left Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia on 12 February 1971 bound for Cape Town, South Africa, with a cargo of (63,174 tonnes) of Arabian crude oil on board. Half the cargo was owned by Chevron Oil Sales Co., and the other half by Texaco Export, Inc. The ship was rounding the southern tip of Africa at 6:30 am on 27 February 1971 when the piping that brought seawater on board to cool her steam turbine failed. The engine room flooded, incapacitating the ship. She was taken under tow the following day by the Russian steam tanker Gdynia, which ‚Äì finding the task too difficult ‚Äì handed the tow over to Pongola off Cape Agulhas, later the same day. The tow cable subsequently broke, and Wafra grounded on a reef near Cape Agulhas at 5:30 pm on 28 February. All six of the port cargo tanks, as well as two of the six center tanks, were ruptured, resulting in approximately 26,000 tonnes of oil leaking at the grounding site, of which 6,000 tonnes washed up at Cape Agulhas. Another source estimated that nearly 14 million gallons of oil was lost in the event (approx 45500 tonnes). A by oil spill resulted, which affected a colony of 1200 African penguins on Dyer Island near Gansbaai. Beaches from Gansbaai to Cape Agulhas were oiled by the slick. American newspapers reported that the slick was up to 35 miles long. Almost 4,000 gallons of detergent was sprayed onto the slick in efforts to prevent it washing ashore or harming marine life. The ship was refloated and pulled off the reef on 8 March by the German tug Oceanic, but started to break apart. To prevent further oil contamination of the coastline, the larger section was towed out to sea to the edge of the continental shelf (), leaving a oil slick in her wake. On 10 March 1971, Buccaneer aircraft of the South African Air Force attempted to sink her with AS-30L missiles, but succeeded only in starting a fire. The ship burned for two days before a Shackleton aircraft was eventually able to sink it with depth charges in of water. If Wafra had been a twin screw, two engine room ship, loss of an engine would most likely not have caused the loss of the whole ship. At the time, the oil spill was in the top twenty most disastrous tanker spills on record. Aftermath In the wake of the accident, the South African Department of Transport realised that despite many Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) using the Cape sea route each year, the authorities did not have ocean-going tugs that were able to assist them in distress, and to protect sensitive marine areas by breaking up oil spills with chemical dispersants. They therefore set up an oil spill prevention service known as Kuswag (Coastwatch) and commissioned two new salvage tugs, John Ross and Wolrade Woltemade. The two tugs, with their engines, held the record as the world's largest salvage tugs. The incident is featured in the 1975 book Supership by Noel Mostert.

History The first division of senatorial districts occurred in 1917, and came as a result of the signing of the Jones-Shafroth Act. This act allowed for Puerto Ricans to elect their first Senate and provided for the appropriate distribution of the municipalities for their representation in the Senate. Originally, the island was divided in seven senatorial districts.Jones-Shafroth Act on LexJuris Through the years, the distribution of the districts has been revised several times. Although in most cases, the revisions are minor, there have been cases where the changes have been significant. For example, in the redistribution of 1952, an eight district was added.

Only one was built but it set several records in the under class both as a landplane and a floatplane. Design and development The Peyret-Mauboussin PM X was the first of three designs to come from the firm formed by Pierre Mauboussin and Louis Peyret in 1928. It was designed to be as simple, inexpensive and cheap to run as possible to encourage more people to fly and was originally intended to compete at the September 1928 Orly International Lightplane Competition (Concourse d'avions l√©gere) but was not completed in time. It had a one-piece wing, straight-tapered in plan out to elliptical tips and mounted on top of the fuselage. It also tapered outwards in thickness, with a horizontal lower surface, and had reflexed camber or double curvature. Its aspect ratio of 10 was high for the period. Structurally, the all-wooden wing was built around two box spars, ribs and three-ply skin. There were narrow-chord, full-span ailerons, each divided into two parts, the outer section conventional and the inner serving as a camber-changing flap. The PM X was powered by a ABC Scorpion II flat-twin engine, mounted in the nose with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Its fuel tanks were in the wing. The fuselage was a strikingly short, flat-sided, rectangular section structure, formed by four spruce longerons and double ply covered, with the pilot's enclosed cabin under the wing leading edge; the PM X's tapered nose gave him a good forward view. Behind him there was a luggage space, capable of accommodating a passenger seat. Access to the cabin was via a port-side door. Behind the cabin the fuselage tapered markedly to a vertical tail, the shape of which became a Mauboussin trademark. It was tall, strongly straight-tapered to a rounded tip and carried a deep unbalanced rudder. The horizontal tail was also strongly straight-tapered, with an unbalanced one-piece elevator and mounted on the fuselage underside, clear of the bottom of the rudder. Its landing gear was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, cranked axles mounted on a central inverted strut-pyramid from the lower fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was . The PM X had a short, castering tailskid. Operational history The PM X was first flown on 7 December 1928, piloted by Charles Fauvel. In September 1929, flying from le Bourget, he began to set a series of world records for light aircraft in the under empty weight 4th category. On 4 September he covered at and the following day reached an altitude of . On the 6 September he covered on a closed circuit and on the 10th flew a straight line record of . A year later he extended the circuit record to and added a duration record of 12 h 3 m. The M.10 was then modified into a seaplane (Hydravion in French), equipped with a pair of floats. Renamed the H.10, it first flew on 23 November 1930 and set more records in its new class. It was withdrawn from use after an accident on 24 October 1932.

Despite its large size, the Regiment of Artillery comprises number of regiments stationed with corps and divisions. The Regiment of Artillery was initially part of the Regiment of Artillery of Indian Army, but linked itself with Royal Artillery and later integrated with Royal Indian Artillery. However, its modern history started in 1947 with the establishment of Pakistan. First founded as Royal Pakistan Artillery, it was re-designed on 23 March 1956, and since then it is known as Corps of Artillery. In 1947, the Corps inherited only eight gun regiments, one survey battery, an air observation post flight and two formation headquarters. Its earlier commanders were from British Army. However, in 1955, with the help and assistance received by United States Army's Field Artillery Branch through the U.S. aid, the corps completely abolished its British Army organisation, with many of its officers called British Army system, a \\"Complex and Non-rationale\\". The regiments in the British system were equipped with 24 guns held in three batteries, further divided in two troops of 4 guns each. Pakistan adopted US system of 18 guns in each regiment, divided in three batteries of 6 guns each. Gun troop was done away with. The Corps first earned renown in Indo-Pakistani war of 1947, and also actively participated in Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 with approximately 550 guns have participated. However its performance was criticised in Bangladesh Liberation War, followed by Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, where it failed to produce any effective results. After the 1971 conflict, the Corps was re-organised and more advance courses were introduced. Since 1971, the Regiment has emerged as one of the potent combatant arms in the Pakistan Army. It participated in notable operations and wars involving Pakistan at numerous occasions and time intervals. Right after joining artillery, the officers and personnel are sent to School of Artillery which was established by Pakistan Army in 1947 at Nowshera. From period 1947-1955, massive re-organization and re-establishment took place and, on 11 November 1958, the research and development cell was placed, followed by a Physics and Mathematics division was also established the same year. Since its inception, all personnel and officers are made mandatory to attend and pass these courses with advanced grades, before reaching to a commissioned service and active duty. * Regiments ** Field Regiment ** Mountain Regiment ** Medium Regiment ** Heavy Regiment ** Self Propelled (Med) Regiment ** Self Propelled (Heavy) Regiment ** Met and Locating Regiment ** Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher Regiment ** Multiple Launching Rocket System Regiment References Media Gallery Regiment of Artillery: History *Regiment of Artillery: Present war Military units and formations established in 1948 1947 establishments in Pakistan ","title":"Pakistan Army Artillery Corps"},{"id":"34162517","title":"Delilah (musician)"},{"id":"34162639","title":"1993 Federation Cup Europe/Africa Zone"},{"id":"34162662","text":"Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG or QEEG) is a field concerned with the numerical analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data and associated behavioral correlates.  Details  Techniques used in digital signal analysis are extended to the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG). These include wavelet analysis and Fourier analysis, with new focus on shared activity between rhythms including phase synchrony (coherence, phase lag) and magnitude synchrony (comodulation/correlation, and asymmetry). The analog signal comprises a microvoltage time series of the EEG, sampled digitally and sampling rates adequate to over-sample the signal (using the Nyquist principle of exceeding twice the highest frequency being detected). Modern EEG amplifiers use adequate sampling to resolve the EEG across the traditional medical band from DC to 70 or 100 Hz, using sample rates of 250/256, 500/512, to over 1000 samples per second, depending on the intended application. QEEG can be performed by open-source toolboxes such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox. Several QEEG products have received Class 2 FDA medical device clearance and the method has received some medical acceptance for use in epilepsy patients. However QEEG has not been endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology or the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society. Barrett, Stephen, M.D. (2015). \\"How Useful Is a Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG)?\\"  Fourier analysis of EEG  The Fourier decomposes the EEG time series into a voltage by frequency spectral graph commonly called the \\"power spectrum\\", with power being the square of the EEG magnitude, and magnitude being the integral average of the amplitude of the EEG signal, measured from(+) peak-to-(-)peak), across the time sampled, or epoch. The epoch length determines the frequency resolution of the Fourier, with a 1-second epoch providing a 1 Hz resolution (plus/minus 0.5 Hz resolution), and a 4-second epoch providing ¬º Hz, or plus/minus 0.125 Hz resolution. : f(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-2 \\\\pi ix \\\\xi}\\\\, dx Where Œæ = frequency Wavelet analysis of EEG A wavelet is a time-frequency transformation that allows analysis of EEG signals in the time extension that is not possible with Fourier analysis. : X(a,b) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\overline{\\\\Psi\\\\left(\\\\frac{t - b}{a}\\\\right)} x(t)\\\\, dt Where a = scaling; b = time  Uses  QEEG has been accepted for clinical application in some areas, such as cerebro-vascular disorders and epilepsy, though it remains yet to be accepted in other clinical areas, such as diagnosing mild traumatic brain injury or psychiatric disorders. The use of qEEG techniques in investigations in clinical and research settings are on going. QEEG has also been utilized to provide neurofeedback, which is a form of biofeedback, wherein electrical activity in the brain is monitored by a computer program, which is applied to modulate visual or auditory stimuli - These stimuli, in turn, are designed to be controlled by the user.

Life Zorard was born around 980 in Opatowiec, a small village in Poland. A tradition in the small village of Tropie holds that in his youth he lived near there as a monk. At around the year 1000, at about the age of 20, he began living as a hermit and a missionary, evangelizing in Olawa, Silesia (modern Poland). At some time, he also traveled to northern Hungary (Slovakia) Around the year 1003 Zorard settled in Hungary, becoming a Benedictine monk at the St. Hippolytus Monastery on Mount Zobor near Nitra - then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. He took the name \\"Andrew\\". There he became the spiritual guide of Benedict of Szkalka. Andrew and Benedict, with the permission of their superior Philip, later left the monastery and became hermits in a cave along the V√°g River near Trenƒç√≠n in modern Skalka nad V√°hom. Andrew died of natural causes around 1009. He practiced such severe austerities that, according to legend, the iron chain, which he wore wrapped around the belt, eventually grew into his body. Benedict continued to live in the cave for three years until he was murdered by a gang of thieves looking for treasure. In 1083 Andrew's relics were transferred to St. Emmeram's Cathedral in Nitra where they remain to this day. A biography of Benedict and Andrew was written by St. Maurus, Bishop of P√©cs, in which it says that Andrew led a hermit life living in a small cave near the monastery. The cave has since been called Svoradova. Feast Day and veneration Saint Andrew Zorard Andrew is venerated especially in Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but also in the United States. His feast day is 17 July, but in some calendars he is venerated together with Benedict on 13 June. King G√©za I of Hungary declared him one of the patron saints of Hungary. Andrew died around 1009. Duke G√©za, as early as 1064, took the first steps towards his canonization, although the cult of the saint was officially confirmed in July 1083 by Pope Gregory VII, thanks to the Hungarian King Ladislaus I.

Early life and education Adolf Dehn, Olds, and unidentified, with Reginald Marsh facing camera, . 1937 (Archives of American Art) Olds was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to a middle-class family. Olds's mother was an art historian, and her mother exposed Olds and her sister, Eleanor, to art through visits to the Walker Art Center and Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Olds's art was first documented in her high school yearbook, featuring a cartoon sketch of a goose at tea. She studied Home Economics and Architectural Drawing at the University of Minnesota from 1916-1918, and received a scholarship to study at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design from 1918-1921. In 1921, Olds received another scholarship to study at the Art Students League of New York where she studied under George Luks. Career Early works The early style of Olds reflects Luks's influence on her art. The pair experimented with the style and themes of the Ashcan school, visiting the Lower East Side of New York to observe the exotic urban immigrant. During the summers from 1923-1925, Olds was invited to the circles of The Roots and their friends and the Percy Saunders of Clinton, New York. In 1925, with the help of Elihu Root and some bankers, Olds was funded to travel to France. While in France, she observed and sketched the famous circus family, the Fratellini family, and their show, ‚ÄúCirque d‚ÄôHiver.‚Äù Olds later joined the troupe as a trick bareback rider. In 1926, Olds became the first woman awarded with the Guggenheim Fellowship, and was granted further travel in Europe. Great Depression Two Boys, a painting by Elizabeth Olds for the United States Works Progress Administration Olds was fairly sheltered from the Great Depression when she returned to the U.S. in 1929. In 1932, Olds viewed Jos√© Clemente Orozco‚Äôs nearly finished murals at Dartmouth College, and was inspired by his expressive use of form and political themes. The same year, she moved to Omaha, Nebraska to paint portraits of the family of Samuel Rees, a local industrialist. Olds completed the project, but she became frustrated with the monotony of painting portraits. At the same time Olds was studying the basics of lithography at Rees's printing business. From 1933-1934, Olds was invited to join the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) in Omaha. Under the PWAP, Olds created a series of lithographs featuring the bread lines, shelters, and clinics of the Great Depression. Olds‚Äôs break from portraiture was fruitful as she developed her style and content, which like Orozco‚Äôs murals, used broad, expressive lines and portrayed political themes. Later, Olds studied at a meat packing plant, which inspired her ‚Äò'Stockyard Series‚Äô‚Äô. \\"Sheep Skinners,\\" one of the ten black-and-white lithographs, was exhibited in 1935 in the Weyhe Gallery in New York as one of the ‚ÄúFifty Best Prints of the Year.‚Äù From 1935 until the early 1940s, Olds was a nonrelief employee for the Works Progress Administration- Federal Art Project (WPA-FAP) in the Graphic Arts Division in New York, where she helped younger artists in the silkscreen unit. She also joined the American Artists‚Äô Congress, Artists Union, and other groups with similar interests. Olds became friends with Harry Gottlieb, another nonrelief artist who also focused on industrialism. Together, they observed the mining and steel industries of New York, and their research lead to Olds's creation of her award-winning print, \\"Miner Joe.\\" Olds used both silkscreen and lithography for the prints for ‚Äò‚ÄòMiner Joe,‚Äô‚Äô but it was her lithograph that won first place for the Philadelphia Print Club competition in 1938. Olds and Gottlieb experimented with silkscreen printing as a fine arts medium.Watrous, James. American Printmaking: A Century of American Printmaking, 1880-1980. Madison: UP Art College of Wisconsin, 1984. p:107 They accomplished this with a few other artists in the silkscreen unit of the Graphic Arts Division of the WPA-FAP in New York. From 1939 until 1941, Olds and Gottlieb opened and ran the independent Silk Screen School for students interested in learning the newest printmaking technologies.Langa, Helen. Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York. Oakland: UC Press, 2004. p:32 Her work was included in the 1940 MoMA show American Color Prints Under $10. The show was organized as a vehicle for bringing affordable fine art prints to the general public. Olds submitted and reproduced 10 prints in The New Masses in 1936 and 1937, a leftist magazine at the time. In the United American Artists under the Public Use of Art Committee, Olds and other artists worked to produce murals along New York City Subway walls, but the murals were never installed. Olds‚Äôs art reflected her leftist political views, but also her social and political awareness at the time. As a WPA-FAP employee, Olds‚Äôs prints were intended to go to the government for their purposes, but she selectively sent her leftist prints to George C. Miller, an independent lithographer. Later works After the war, Olds redirected her skills and began experimenting with watercolor, collage, and woodblock prints. Her silk screen, \\"Three Alarm Fire\\" (1945), prompted Roberta Fansler to suggest that Olds should illustrate children's books. From 1945-1963, Olds wrote and illustrated six children's books. In three of her books, Olds wrote about firefighters, trains, and oil, educating her readers about industrialism. In the early 1950s, Olds was hired as an illustrator-reporter for The New Republic and Fortune (magazine). In the summers of the 1950s and 1960s, Olds was awarded artist-in-residence positions at the artists‚Äô colonies of Yaddo near Saratoga Springs in New York and McDowell in Peterborough, New Hampshire.\\"Elizabeth Olds (1896‚Äì1991)\\".

In 1853 he became a preparateur of geology at the Sorbonne, later obtaining his doctorate with a thesis titled M√©moire sur les terrains primaires de la Belgique, des environs d'Avesnes et du Boulonnais (1860). He later taught high school physics and chemistry in Bordeaux, afterwards serving as an instructor of natural history at the Faculty of Poitiers. In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of geology at the recently established Faculty of Lille. In 1913 he became a non-resident member of the Academy of Sciences.

The creative Director of the show is Kshonish Palit and Associate Creative Director is Mohammad Faizan. The show concluded with a finalist face off between the two teams, in which Nabeel Shaukat Ali from Pakistan won the title.  Format  The contestants are judged by the jury members based on their performance and are awarded marks which is either a zero or a ten. Meaning that if the jury likes the performance they will give a 10 otherwise a 0. The marks of individual contestants are then added team wise and the team with the higher score wins and the captain of the winning team gets to choose a participant to compete for the finalist chairs in a face off. After four episodes the face off takes place and the winner of the face off gets a finalist chair which means straight entry to the finals, while the losing captain has to eliminate one of its contestants.  Finalists  There were 5 finalist chairs at the start of the show. Sara Raza Khan was the first contestant to sit on a finalist chair based on the decision of the jury. Mulazzim Hussain became the second finalist after winning the face off. Yashraj Kapil sat on the third finalist chair as the captain Himesh Reshammiya left it up to the judges to decide the third finalist from his team. Budhaditya Mukherjee became the fourth finalist after winning the face off for the fourth chair. The battle for the fifth chair proved to be the most exciting as Nabeel Shaukat Ali from Pakistan and Diljaan from team India went head to head in the face off. There was a lot of drama after the face off as both the contestants sang really well and it became very tough for the jury members to decide who should be the fifth finalist Asha Bhosle wanted Diljaan to be the finalist while Abida Parveen wanted Nabeel Shaukat Ali to be the fifth finalist. The neutral judge Runa Laila refused to take the decision and threatened to walk out of the show. After much drama it was finally decided that there would be six finalists instead of five and hence both Diljaan and Nabeel Shaukat Ali made it to the finals. And in the finales Nabeel Shaukat Ali from Pakistan won the title by beating Diljaan in the face-off round.Nabeel Shaukat Ali wins Sur Kshetra Retrieved on 29 Dec 2012  Eliminations  Shahzad Ali from team India was the first to be eliminated.

As Diljaan and Nabeel Shaukat Ali were chosen as the contestants to face off for the fifth finalist chair, Aman Trikha and Nadeem Abbas were eliminated. Finally there were six finalists on the bench. Three from Pakistan and Three from India. In the Pre-finals it was announced that two finalists with minimum marks would be eliminated and remaining four participants would go through to the Grand Finals. Sara Raza Khan was unable to compete in the last two pre-finals because of her health so she along with Buddhaditya was eliminated as they had the lowest marks.

Fossils are known from the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group. The type species of Sintocephalus, S. alticeps, was first named in 1913 as a species of Dicynodon. The genus was erected in 1934, but in subsequent years its species were often regarded as members of other dicynodont genera. Description Compared to other dicynodonts, Sintocephalus is distinguished by the thickness and upward curve of its temporal arch behind the eyes. It also has a sharply sloped snout, large eye sockets, and tusks that are positioned forward in the upper jaw. The intertemporal region at the top of the skull between the two temporal fenestrae is very wide. History The type species S. alticeps was first named by paleontologists Robert Broom and Sidney H. Haughton in 1913. Broom and Haughton regarded it as a species of Dicynodon, calling it D. alticeps. In 1934, paleontologist E. C. N. van Hoepen considered D. alticeps to be distinct from other Dicynodon, and placed it in its own genus Sintocephalus. Van Hoepen also reassigned Dicynodon gilli, Dicynodon jouberti, and Dicynodon woodwardi to this genus. S. gilli and S. woodwardi were later considered valid species of Dicynodon (although they are currently classified in the genera Dinanomodon and Basilodon), and S. jouberti has since been transferred to the genus Diictodon. In 1986, paleontologist A. S. Brink synonymized the type species S. alticeps with Dicynodon lacerticeps. Because a genus is defined by its type species, the abandonment of S. alticeps implied that the name Sintocephalus was no longer valid. However, Brink kept the name Sintocephalus for S. gilli. Most other paleontologists have abandoned the use of Sintocephalus altogether. Following a phylogenetic analysis of dicynodonts by Christian F. Kammerer, Kenneth D. Angielczyk, and J√∂rg Fr√∂bisch in 2011, Sintocephalus was reinstated as a valid genus including the species S. alticeps. The holotype specimen of S. alticeps was distinguished from D. lacerticeps material, and the species was found to be separate from the Dicynodon clade (which included only D. lacerticeps and D. huenei). S. alticeps was placed in the family Lystrosauridae, with its closest relative being Basilodon woodwardi.

It is located west of Bralorne on the northeastern flank of the Mount Meager massif. With an elevation of , it lies on the steep northern face of Plinth Peak, a high volcanic peak comprising the northern portion of Meager. The vent rises above the western shoulder of the Pemberton Valley and represents the northernmost volcanic feature of the Mount Meager massif. At least eight volcanic vents compose the Meager massif, with the Bridge River Vent being the most recent to form. It is the only vent of the massif to exhibit volcanic activity in the past 10,000 years and one of the several vents in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt to erupt since the end of the last glacial period. The crater constitutes a bowl-shaped depression overlain by glacial ice and volcanic debris that were deposited during volcanic activity. Its breached northern rim has been a pathway for lava and ash flows that have traveled throughout the nearby Pemberton Valley. Eruptive history Background Volcanic activity of the Mount Meager massif is caused by subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. This is a long fault zone running off the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500 years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake. Bridge River eruption The Bridge River Vent was formed during an onset of eruptive activity about 2,350 years ago that ended a long period of dormancy at the Mount Meager massif. Substantially, the Bridge River event was explosive in nature, ranging from Plinian to Pel√©an activity. This is one of the most recent eruptions in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and the largest known explosive eruption in Canada in the past 10,000 years. It had similarities to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in the U.S. state of Washington and the continuous eruption of Soufri√®re Hills on the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. The eruption, which was likely VEI-5 in nature, included a series of eruptive episodes that created a variety of volcanic deposits. They are exposed in cliff sections near the long Lillooet River and comprise the Pebble Creek Formation. =Plinian phase= At the start of the eruption, a large Plinian column rose above the Bridge River Vent, creating its bowl-shaped volcanic crater. This explosive eruption might have been followed by the collapse of a former lava dome based on the existence of a thick cover of welded vitrophyric breccia. The Plinian column is estimated to have had a height of to . Its height has been calculated by comparing the size and density of rugged pumice fragments away from the vent area. However, the eruption column was likely higher than the estimated data indicates because it does not include the highest portions of the column. During this time of the eruption, tephra spread into the stratosphere and parts of the mushroom-shaped ash column collapsed, devastating nearby areas with heavy pyroclastic fall which deposited tephra on Meager's steep flanks. A pyroclastic fall deposit up to thick consists largely of light grey pumice grains that range in diameter from to . About 1‚Äì5% of the pumice grains contain white to dark grey bands. About 1‚Äì2% of the grains comprising the thick pyroclastic fall deposit were derived from the older Plinth Assemblage as the energetic Plinian column blasted the surrounding rock of Plinth Peak. These clasts are relatively minor to the abundant pumice grains. At least four other minor grain types make up less than 1% of the pyroclastic fall deposit. The most common is a somewhat inflated grey grain petrographically similar to the grey pumice grains. Ignimbrite forms a less common, but significant genetic grain. It includes level to extremely rounded pieces of white pumice that are normally to in diameter and are enclosed by a red to pink, fine-grained, consistent matrix. Another grain, consisting of extremely rounded but glacially dissected quartz monzonite, is another small but widespread element of the pyroclastic fall deposit. The most infrequent of the four minor grain types is interpreted to be heated and burnt clay-rich soil. All four minor grain types are widespread in the pyroclastic fall deposit and are not restricted to any one portion or extent. Strong high-altitude winds carried material east-northeasterly from the Plinian column to as far as Alberta, away from the vent to produce a large volcanic ash deposit. This widespread ash deposit, known as the Bridge River Ash, overlies older ash deposits from other large explosive eruptions in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, such as the 3,400‚Äëyear‚Äëold Yn Ash from Mount St. Helens and the 6,800‚Äëyear‚Äëold Mazama Ash from the catastrophic collapse of Mount Mazama. After this took place, a major pyroclastic flow deposited blocks of rounded pumice to in diameter on pyroclastic fall deposits of the collapsed Plinian column. The pyroclastic flow burnt and buried Meager's forested slopes in place. Remnants of this catastrophe are exposed south and east of the Bridge River Vent along the Lillooet River. At the vent area, the thickness of this pyroclastic flow ranges from to . =Pel√©an phase= After the first major pyroclastic flow, a hot block and ash flow was erupted off the face of an advancing lava dome. This deposited of brittlely jointed welded breccia on top of the first major pyroclastic flow deposit. The slightly divided joints associated with the block and ash flow deposit range in a pattern from irregular to radial, indicating that the block and ash flow was rapidly quenched by water. These features might represent the first evidence of water reaction during the eruption and are mainly located near the high Keyhole Falls along the Lillooet River. The welded block and ash flow deposit is enclosed by a grey weathering glassy matrix. A pyroclastic flow deposit forming the foreground canyon wall on the Lillooet River. The Bridge River Vent is at the upper right corner. The second and final major pyroclastic flow occurred when another pulse of gas-rich magma was erupted. This deposited of tephra on the earlier block and ash flow. In contrast to the first major pyroclastic flow, this pyroclastic flow was smaller and less energetic. Also, no burnt wood has been observed. Fine-grained volcanic ash, crystal and rock fragments comprise the matrix of the second major pyroclastic flow deposit. A second hot welded block and ash flow erupted off the face of an advancing lava dome into the Lillooet River valley, forming a pyroclastic dam at least high. This block and ash flow deposited irregularly welded, monolithologic and vitophyric breccia that ranges from thick at Keyhole Falls to thick between two creeks further downstream. About 50% of the breccia consists of thick black glassy angular blocks of porphyritic lava, some of which are flow banded. The breccia grains range in size from a few centimetres to about in length. Infrequent welded breccia grains in the thickest portion of the block and ash flow deposit adjacent to Keyhole Falls include grey spherulites and lithophysae. The third and final block and ash flow deposited breccia more than thick. It was also erupted off the face of an advancing lava dome. In most locations the deposit is deeply eroded and forms recessively weathered slopes covered with vegetation. =Failure of volcanic dam= Damming of the Lillooet River from the second block and ash flow resulted in the creation of a lake just upstream. This lake continued to fill when the third block-and-ash flow was erupted, eventually reaching a maximum elevation of and a depth of at least . As the lake continued to rise from inflow of the Lillooet River, the variably welded, poorly indurated pyroclastic dam failed catastrophically, releasing lake water down the Pemberton Valley to produce an outburst flood. Large volcanic blocks derived from the pyroclastic dam were carried downstream for where they were deposited in the water-saturated debris. An image of Keyhole Falls. The foreground cliff consists of welded breccia that formed the competent portion of the pyroclastic dam but was eroded by the flood waters during the eruption about 2,350 years ago. Additionally, the pyroclastic dam was still hot and poorly indurated when the flood waters rapidly cut through the pyroclastic material. Headward erosion of the dam created a wide and long canyon. The flood was significant enough to leave volcanic blocks above the pre-existing valley floor downstream of the dam failure. However, the flood was not long or large enough to complete headward erosion through the entire sequence of pyroclastic material. Subsequent erosion by the Lillooet River has created a wide and deep gorge in the competent portion of the pyroclastic dam from which Keyhole Falls cascades down. =Extrusion of lava flow= The final event of the eruption was the extrusion of a small thick glassy dacite lava flow. Although it has been heavily overgrown by vegetation, its original form is still well preserved. This lava flow was poor in volcanic gas, indicating that minor or no explosivity occurred when it was erupted. It is long and varies in thickness from to . The southern margin of the lava flow cooled into well preserved columnar joints. Subsequent erosion of the lava flow by Fall Creek has created a waterfall. Later eruptions In 1977, J. A. Westgate of the University of Toronto suggested that a smaller eruption may have occurred at the Bridge River Vent after the eruption 2,350 years ago, sending tephra to the southeast. A tephra deposit overlying the Bridge River Ash at Otter Creek shows strong genetic relationships with the Bridge River Ash, differing only by its absence of biotite. In earlier publications, this tephra is classified as part of the Bridge River Ash. However, it has been dated to be about 2,000 radiocarbon years old, indicating that this tephra is a few hundred years younger than the Bridge River Ash. Apparent absence of biotite and occurrence well to the south of the Bridge River Ash likewise favour a separate identity.

Sewall Reed, likely made in San Francisco prior to the departure of the Cal Hundred for the East. James \\"J\\" Sewall Reed is best remembered as an organizer of a few hundred Californians who fought in the eastern battlefields of the American Civil War as part of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry while most soldiers from California were assigned to Union Army outposts west of the Mississippi River. Early years James was the eldest of three sons of John Reed and Miranda Barker. He was born in Milton, Massachusetts on 3 April 1832. At the age of 17, James and his younger brother George left Boston for the California Gold Rush. The teen-agers arrived in San Francisco Bay in March, 1850, and mined gold in Nevada City, California, until 1852. James became a member of the 1856 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, and traveled Central America and South America before joining the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858. He returned to Boston in 1859 where he met and married Hattie L. Wales. James returned to San Francisco with his bride in September, 1859; and their son Walter Sewall Reed was born there on 25 January 1861. Civil War Reed joined the California State Militia First Light Dragoons of San Francisco in November, 1861. The Dragoons' patrols of the Central Overland Route seemed unexciting in comparison to the newspaper accounts of civil war battles in the east. In the fall of 1862, a group of Californians from the northeastern United States approached Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew proposing to supply a company of 100 cavalry volunteers. The governor accepted the volunteers with the stipulation the men would pay for their uniforms, equipment, and ship passage east. A Massachusetts enlistment bounty defrayed part of those costs, and citizens of San Francisco donated some equipment. Reed resigned his commission with the 1st Dragoons to become captain of the California Hundred. Pre-Civil War image of J. Sewall Reed as a member of the California First Light Dragoons. The California Hundred sailed from San Francisco aboard the steamship Golden Age on 10 December 1862. After traveling across the isthmus of Panama and arriving in New York aboard the Ocean Queen, the California Hundred were designated company A of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry commanded by Colonel Charles Russell Lowell. Reed and his men went into combat in Virginia in April, 1863. Subsequent California volunteers were designated companies E, F, L, and M of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. Men from Massachusetts formed seven more companies. Reed's company participated in a series of engagements with the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry commanded by John S. Mosby. Reed was one of five Californians killed at the Second Dranesville battle on 22 February 1864.

He was abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of Pannonhalma between around 1029 and 1036, and bishop of P√©cs from year 1036 until his death around year 1075. He wrote the Legend of Saints Benedict and Andrew Zorard, two hermits who lived in the region of Nitra in modern-day Slovakia. Maurus's own cult was confirmed by Pope Pius IX in 1848. Life Maurus was born around 1000. J√°nos Kar√°csonyi and other historians have suggested that he was born in the region of Nyitra, but he himself does not refer to it as his place of birth in his work on the two hermits from the same region. The Legend of Saint Emmeric relates that Maurus was still a child when his parents sent him to the Benedictine abbey at Pannonhalma. The Legend also reveals that Maurus was on friendly terms with Emeric, the saintly crown prince of Hungary. For instance, Maurus was the only monk whom Emeric greeted with seven kisses on the occasion of one of his visits in the monastery, demonstrating his conviction that Maurus had respected his vow of chastity. Emeric's father, Stephen I, the first king of Hungary appointed Maurus abbot of the monastery in 1029 at the latest. According to the Greater Legend of Saint Gerard, Maurus sent four monks from Pannonhalma to assist Gerard, the first bishop of Csan√°d (now Cenad, Romania) in organizing the new diocese. The Annales Posonienses narrates that Maurus was appointed the second bishop of P√©cs in 1036. Maurus was the prelate who finished the construction of the earliest cathedral in P√©cs in the reign of Stephen I's successor, Peter I. He was one of the three bishops who survived the pagan uprising that put an end to King Peter's rule, thus the three bishops together celebrated the coronation of the new king, Andrew I in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in 1046. Maurus's prestige in the new king's court is demonstrated by the deed of founding of the Benedictine Tihany Abbey from 1055 on which his signature is only preceded by that of the archbishop of Esztergom. The contemporary Palatine of the kingdom, Rad√≥ also bequeathed a part of his possessions to Maurus and the bishopric of P√©cs in his last will in 1056. The Palatine's will was confirmed by both King Andrew I and his brother and successor, B√©la I. Following B√©la I's death, Maurus succeeded in mediating a peace between the late king's sons, G√©za and Ladislav and King Andrew I's son, Solomon who celebrated their agreement in P√©cs on Easter in 1064. Here G√©za and Ladislav accepted Salamon's right to the throne. Although the cathedral and the bishop's palace was burnt on the next day, around that time Prince G√©za asked the elderly Maurus to write a biography of Benedict and Andrew-Zorard, two hermits from the region of Nitra. In addition to a narration of abbot Philip of Zobor, Maurus could base his work on his conversations with Benedict in his youth in the abbey of Pannonhalma. His cult began shortly after his death. Based on the continuous tradition of Maurus's local veneration, his cult was confirmed by the Holy See on July 22, 1848. Pope Pius IX emphasized that \\"there are mass-books from 1499 which sing Blessed Maurus's praises, and his name was also recorded in Martyrologies\\". He was initially celebrated in the Diocese of P√©cs on the fourth Sunday of each October, but October 25 became his feast day in 1913.

The line stretches nearly 1,000 kilometres linking the port city of Townsville, Australia to the mining town of Mount Isa in north-west Queensland. Along with a passenger service called the Inlander, it is a major freight route connecting the Mount Isa Mines to the Townsville Port. In 2010 the line moved 5.8 million tonnes of cargo, and this is expected to increase significantly in coming years.Mount Isa System Rail Infrastructure Master Plan Queensland Rail, retrieved 25 December 2011 History Originally approved in 1877,Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications 1990 its construction over nearly thirty years along with the building of other lines in Queensland was dictated by the pressing need to transport minerals and wool from isolated inland areas to the coast for shipment. To the goldfields In Townsville‚Äôs case it was given impetus by the discovery of gold at Ravenswood, Queensland and Charters Towers, Queensland in 1868 and 1872 respectively. The first section of the railway opened on 20 December 1880 and followed a southerly path to Reid River via small sidings at Stuart, Antill Plains, Toonpan, Woodstock and Calcium. The line then turned westward and climbed the Haughton Range using 1 in 25 (4%) grades and ~65 m (3.5 chain) radius curves in order to minimise construction costs. The line opened on 9 November 1881 to Ravenswood Junction (renamed Mingela in 1931 after closure of the Ravenswood branch railway). On 24 July 1882 the line opened to the Burdekin River at Macrossan (named after John Murtagh Macrossan) and via Sellheim reached Charters Towers railway station on 4 December 1882. Trains took more than five hours to cover roughly 140 kilometres from Townville. The line proved so successful that the original Haughton Range section was deviated in 1887 with a 6 km line with 1 in 50 (2%) grades to improve the tonnage that could be hauled on the section. The original 1-in-25 alignment is now used by the Flinders Highway. In 1899, the first bridge over the Burdekin River was replaced by the Burdekin River Rail Bridge designed by chief railway engineer, Henry Charles Stanley. Although replaced by a third bridge in 1964, the second bridge remains and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. West for wool In 1881 the Queensland Parliament approved a trebling of the line further west to Hughenden. The significant extension was again opened in stages - on 11 February 1884 to Homestead via sidings at Southern Cross, Powlathanga, Balfe‚Äôs Creek, Mungunburra and Thalanga; on 6 October 1884 to Pentland via Kimburra and Cape River; on 5 October 1885 to Torrens Creek via Warrigal and Burra; on 3 January 1887 to Prairie via Wareah and Karoon and, finally, on 19 October 1887 via Tindo, Jardine Valley and Poorooga sidings to Hughenden. The line proved very profitable and a daily mixed train took about thirteen hours to complete the journey from Old Townsville railway station. Although by 1892 inland trunk routes extended as far west as Hughenden, Longreach, Queensland and Charleville, Queensland, those termini were still a long way from Queensland‚Äôs western border and the State Government was keen to encourage settlement in the largely dry and remote central and southern far west. With this in mind, an extension from Hughenden south-west to Winton was approved in 1896 and 1897. Construction was undertaken in three stages. The line opened via Watten, Alba and Warianna sidings to Stamford on 13 December 1897, via Chinbi, Whitewood and Tarvano to Corfield (previously Manuka) on 15 October 1898 and via sidings at Olio, Lana, Prubi, Oondooroo and Rangelands to Winton on 5 July 1899. Winton passengers could make it to Townsville in about seventeen hours whilst an additional mixed service ran between Winton and Hughenden. Further west to the copper fields Cloncurry had been proposed as the destination of the railway from Normanton, but that was diverted to Croydon when gold was discovered there. The economic depression of the 1890s meant that the next proposal for a railway to Cloncurry was delayed by a decade. Having linked Winton to Townsville, copper mining around Cloncurry and vast numbers of sheep and cattle prompted extension of the line directly west from Hughenden. First section constructed was the 110 km to Richmond in 1902. About two-thirds of the section opened to Marathon on 15 December 1903 with tiny sidings established at Ballindallock, Boree, Dunluce and Munu. The speed on the line was limited to . Only six months later on 1 June 1904 Richmond was reached via Barabon and Moselle. Transport of livestock, wool and passengers were thus connected to Townsville. Another extension of nearly 150 kilometres was approved to Julia Creek, Queensland in late 1905 and in December 1906 so too was the remaining 130 kilometres to Cloncurry. Work did not get underway until September 1906 but proceeded rapidly, with temporary crossings of the dry river beds being made ahead of bridge construction so track laying was not delayed. In this arid region that was not a problem for most of the time, and explains the large time difference between the arrival of the first train and the official opening of a section. 85 km of rail that had been sent to Normanton and not used when the line was diverted to Croydon was used to construct part of the line that finally reached Cloncurry. It was railed from Croydon (where it had been stored) back to Normanton, then shipped around Cape York Peninsula to Townsville and railed to the new construction. The first train ran to Julia Creek in June 1907 although the line officially opened on 29 February 1908. As before, sidings were installed at Gemoka (), Maxwelton, Nonda, Nelia () and Quarells to serve nearby sheep and cattle stations. Cloncurry welcomed its first train on 14 December 1907 but it was 13 December 1908 before the official opening took place. Sidings on this section were at Eddington, Gilliat, Tibarri, Bookin, Oorindi, Undina, Pymurra, Kaampa and Oonoomurra. The weekly mail train from Townsville took nearly twenty-four hours to reach Cloncurry. Beyond Cloncurry The route to later connect Cloncurry with Mount Isa was a creature of history. Any extension beyond Cloncurry was overwhelmingly to be dictated by mining interests. The first section went south, with the second section going south west and the final section going north west. Firstly came the Selwyn Branch Railway (Dajarra and Selwyn railway lines) that opened on 15 December 1910 and ran south from Cloncurry to the Hampden and Mt Elliott mines. Smelted copper was railed east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Next in 1911 came construction work on the Dajarra Branch Railway south-west of the Selwyn Branch. It branched from the Selwyn branch at Malbon and opened to Duchess on 21 October 1912 and to Dajarra on 16 April 1917. In 1923 vast silver and lead deposits were discovered at Mount Isa 121 kilometres by road from Cloncurry, 150 kilometres by road north of Dajarra but only 87 kilometres north of Duchess. There was an urgent need to connect rail to the area but the Government was reluctant to invest in what could be a limited life of operation. However the mining company guaranteed any losses on the line and construction began in 1926. Sidings appeared at Myubee, Woonigan, Kurbayia and Rifle Creek and the line opened at last on 27 May 1929. It brought construction of the Great Northern Railway to an end and gave Mount Isa a crucial link to the eastern seaboard. Contrary to the Government‚Äôs doubt, the Mount Isa mine became one of the world‚Äôs most successful operations that continues to this day. Branch lines Ravenswood Junction - Ravenswood Opened on 1 December 1884, the Ravenswood Branch ran via Kirk River some 39 kilometres from Ravenswood Junction to access silver mining operations to the south-east. Although silver smelting faltered in 1886, the line operated for more than thirty years carrying passengers, cattle, minerals and firewood. Ravenswood had the unfortunate distinction however of being the first Queensland town to lose its railway in November 1930, and the junction station was renamed Mingela. Most of its buildings and mining infrastructure are now classified by National Trust. Hughenden - Winton Opened 1899, closed 2008, this was originally part of the Great Northern line until the section west of Hughenden became the main line. Cloncurry - Mt Cuthbert (later Kajabbi) line, opened between 1914 - 1917 to service mining areas. The Oona - Mt Cuthbert section closed in 1949, the Kajabbi - Dobbyn section in 1961 and Cloncurry - Kajabbi closed in 1994, having been a livestock transport line for the final 33 years. Cloncurry - Selwyn Opened in 1910 to serve a mining area, it was funded 20% by the Hampton mine, 30% by the Mt Elliot mine and 50% by the government on the basis the line might be extended further west, which happened the following year from a junction at Malbon. The Cloncurry - Malbon section is now part of the main line. The Malbon - Selwyn branch closed in 1961. Devoncourt - Ballara Built by the Hampton mine as a 35 km private line to the Wee Macgregor mine, it opened in 1915 and connected to a 3 km 610mm (2') gauge tramway. The ore was soon exhausted and the line closed in 1926. Flynn - Phosphate Hill Opened in 1976 to serve a large deposit of phosphate rock for fertiliser. Built to main line standards with 47 kg/m rail and grades of 1 in 125 (0.8%). Duchess - Dajarra Opened 1913 - 1917 as part of the Great Western Railway proposal, closed 1993. Juenburra - Trekalano Opened 1918, a 12 km spur from the Dajarra line to serve a mine, closed 1943  2019 floods  In February 2019 flooding damaged of track between Cloncurry and Hughenden with over 204 places suffering serious erosion and 16 bridges damaged. The repair work needed of ballast and 10,000 new sleepers. The flooding caused the derailment of a Pacific National freight train with 81 wagons at Nelia. A rail deviation was constructed around the derailment. Services When the line reached Hughenden in 1887, the journey by mixed train from Townsville took 12 hours 45 minutes. When the line was extended to Winton, 3 mail trains per week ran, taking 17 hours. When the Hughenden-Cloncurry line opened, the mail train took that route and Winton service became a sleeper attached to the connecting train. A Travelling Post Office was introduced in 1899, and remained part of the consist of the mail train until 1932, when it was removed as an economy measure. One of the first buffet cars was introduced in 1912, attached at Mingela to save hauling it up the Haughton Range. In 1929 the Mt Isa Mail (including Dining Car) made the weekly run from Townsville in 30 hours. That year 41,000 ton of coal was railed to Mt Isa, and 38,000 ton of lead bullion was railed out. The first air-conditioned train in Queensland (including the first air-conditioned sleeping cars in Australia), the Inlander was introduced in February 1953, bringing a new level of comfort and cleanliness to a hot and dusty area of the State. As of 2018, the Inlander takes 21 hours to complete the journey from Townsville to Mt Isa. Contemporary role Today known as the Mt Isa line by Queensland Rail, the line continues to predominantly service mineral traffic. Constructed as a development line, it was upgraded in the 1960s to main line standard. A deviation east of Mingela eased the grade from 1 in 50 (2%) to 1 in 90 (1.1%), and other deviations were made to increase the flood resistance of the line, especially between Cloncurry and Duchess. A major advantage of the line was the efficient use of wagons, hauling coal west to Mt Isa and metal ingots east for export. When the Mica Creek Power Station was converted to gas fuel in 2000, some of the coal traffic ceased, adversely affecting wagon efficiency.

Early life in Spain As a young man Martin studied Latin in his hometown of Granollers. In 1829 he entered a junior seminary in Vic where he concentrated on mathematics and logic. He then graduated to the major seminary in Barcelona and undertook seven years of theological training concluding in 1839. The last six years were accredited by the University of Cervera. Following the completion of his theological studies he was unable to be ordained. The liberal and anticlerical Spanish government had published a ban on ordination in 1835 to reduce the size of the Catholic Church's clerical body, which in the previous century had reached approximately 200,000. During the time he was unable to fulfill his vocation to become a priest, Griver studied medicine and surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Barcelona. He was awarded a bachelor's degree in philosophy specialising medicine in July 1845 and then in the same month received a bachelor's degree in medicine and surgery. Finally, after much perseverance, in December 1847 he was ordained for the diocese of Girona. He was ordained for this diocese as he received a small benefice, a land holding for the support of clergy, from a previous employer the Marquis of Milan that was located within that diocese. He was also granted a licence to exercise his ministry in the diocese of Barcelona. After a brief period as a curate in his home parish of San Esteban he volunteered for Western Australia. Travelling from Spain with Joseph Serra, Griver arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, and applied his knowledge of medicine together with his religious fervour from Albany to Geraldton, as well as across Perth. An 1846 establishment of a Benedictine mission in New Norcia by Griver's compatriot, Rosendo Salvado, was not supported by Serra and created tensions in the sprawling colony. Appointed Administrator of the Diocese, Griver was charged with the responsibility for to separating the activities of the mission with the diocese and facilitating equitable access to funding for Church schools. In 1865, as administrator, Griver completed the first stage of construction of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (St Mary's), Perth. Bishop of Perth Travelling to Rome for the First Vatican Council In 1869, Griver was appointed Titular Bishop of Tlos and consecrated the following year; changing to Perth following the death of Brady in 1871. During 1885 Griver attended the first Plenary Council of Australasia along with fourteen other bishops and fifty-two theologians. During the Council he advocated for the establishment of the Kimberley region as an apostolic vicariate. Due to his age and health, while in Sydney he also proposed three possible candidates for the position of co- adjutor bishop of Perth. The proposed names included Father Matthew Gibney, the future third Bishop of Perth. He died while in office on 1 November 1886 and was buried in St Mary's Cathedral.  Exhumation  During 2006, as part of the restoration of St Mary's, Bishop Griver's remains were exhumed from a brick lined grave by a group of archaeologists under the supervision of Fr Robert Cross and Dr Shane Burke. His successor Bishop Matthew Gibney was buried beside him.

As a source for historians it provides a valuable insight into the interior workings of the French governments of Paul Reynaud and Edouard Deladier from the perspective of an outsider. Prelude to Dunkirk The first volume is titled Prelude to Dunkirk and covers the period from August 1, 1939 to May 31, 1940. The book opens with an idyllic description of luncheon with the Churchills at Chartwell on August 1, 1939 and introduces a theme which becomes extremely important throughout the work: Spears' great admiration for Winston Churchill. The description of a sunny, enjoyable afternoon is contrasted with the discussion of the impending war in which Spears is careful to note all Churchill's (eventually correct) predictions about the coming war. The Fall of France The second volume, The Fall of France takes up the narrative from the June 1st and continues it until Spears' half-humorous, half-tragic account of the departure of his departure from France with General Charles de Gaulle on June 17.

Early years Moving with his family to Southern California, Bill attended South Pasadena High School, where he graduated in 1952. In 1953, Bill attended Northrop Aero Institute, and graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduation, Bill accepted a position in the research and development department of Frebank Co., based in Glendale, California. During Bill's tenure in this position, he led the design and development of a snap action mechanism for a pressure switch that was utilized by NASA in the production of the Saturn V launch vehicle.https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/app-e.htm Bill VanTichelt - raising the dust Career In 1960, Bill along with his father, Bill VanTichelt, Sr., formed VanTech Engineering, located in Visalia, California. VanTech initially began as a design and production shop of specialized hardware for the missile industry.Cycle (September 1967) \\"VanTech\\" page 78 However, in the early sixties, Bill became interested in karting and began applying his engineering background to build a faster kart. Bill VanTichelt, Sr. and Jr. Bill then developed and VanTech produced speed equipment for kart engines. Particularly, Bill developed a reed valve intake manifold for the McCulloch kart engines in 1961.Cycle (September 1967) \\"VanTech\\" page 79http://vintagekartclubofamerica.com/accessories/photo- galleries.html?func=viewcategory&catid;=88&startpage;=4 In 1962, Bill and his father spontaneously decided to build a small pseudo-dirt bike. Their self- designed VanTech frame was paired with bicycle wheels and one of the McCulloch kart engines with the souped-up VanTech manifold. This little prototype however, was the start of bigger things.VMX No. 36 (2008) \\"VanTech -America's First Dirt Bike?\\" page 18 In early 1963, Ray Hook, the creator of Blendzall Racing Oil, hired VanTech to create a special bike for one of Blendzall's sponsored riders, which bike went on to win every 100cc race it was entered into.VMX No. 36 (2008)\\"VanTech -America's First Dirt Bike?\\" page 18 With that success, Bill went on to design, fabricate and build two production bikes.VMX No. 36 (2008)\\"VanTech -America's First Dirt Bike?\\" page 18 Motorcycles Prototype VanTech Hodaka 90 owned by Paul Stannard - restored by Lee Fabry The first model was \\"The Scrambler\\" and was developed as an out-and-out racing machine powered by a McCulloch MAC7 kart engine (99cc to 125cc models fit the VanTech mounts). The second model was the \\"Trials 80\\". This bike was identical to the Scrambler but was powered by a Yamaguchi (now known as Hodaka) motorcycle engine (originally 80cc). The Scrambler and the Trials 80 gained VanTech a reputation as a builder of sturdy, light and well-machined frames. Bill was a stickler for detail - all of the frames were hand-crafted and jig- built, for precise alignment, and the joints where the tubes meet were all milled to fit. The rear suspension was a conventional swing arm set-up and the front was leading link. Bill in an interview with Cycle World in 1963, stated that he was uncertain what combination of rake and trail would produce the handling characteristics he wanted, so he reviewed all the Cycle World road tests of scramble style bikes to identify those with the desired handling combination and went from there - not exactly the most scientific process, but it produced the desired results - excellent handling.Cycle World (May 1964) \\"VanTech Scrambler And Trials 80\\" VanTech Road Racer - restored by Lee Fabry The MAC Scrambler was also the beginning of the VanTech Leading Link Fork.

During this period of production, VanTech was the only other manufacturer besides Harley Davidson producing motorcycles in the United States. The bikes were considered well- made, fast and quite exciting to ride given their small-displacement engines.Cycle (September 1967) \\"VanTech\\" pages 77-80 Southern California Desert Racer, restored by Lee Fabry, owned by Gary Parker The Kits In late 1966, Dick MacCoon of Grant Industries (known for its famous Grant piston rings), contacted Bill to discuss joining forces to create what is now known as the \\"Grant-VanTech Kits\\". A first of its kind, the kits gave riders the ability to convert a variety of lightweight motorcycles to a scrambler, road racer or TT special, or to build their own customized bike.VMX No. 36 (2008) \\"VanTech -America's First Dirt Bike?\\" page 20 VanTech Honda 90 Cafe Racer owned by Rudy Pock, restored by Scott Turner, Team Scott Racing Grant VanTech Kits The Grant VanTech Kit Program resulted in an assortment of chassis parts that enabled 100cc Honda, Yamaha or Bridgestone owners to build a serious bike very economically, including the VanTech Harley Baja 100. The Van Tech frame was lighter, stronger and handled better than any other small- bore machines of the day. Bob Braverman, technical editor of Cycle Guide and an avid motorcycle enthusiast, wrote a series of how-to articles based on various project bikes he completed, such as the VanTech Honda 160 'a go go', the VanTech Honda 450 and the VanTech-framed BSA 441 (441cc) unit single dirt bike.Bob Braverman, Cycle Guide (November 1967) \\"VanTech Honda\\" page 35Bob Braverman, Motorcycle Performance Handbook (May 1968) \\"Building The VanTech Honda 450\\" page 75Bob Braverman, Cycle Guide (April 1970) \\"441 BSA/VanTech\\" page 70 Bill's reputation for his superior VanTech frames was well known in the industry and led to a collaboration with Gordon Jennings from which they created a prototype VanTech Frame for a Bridgestone 350 GTR.

He has achieved success in broadcast journalism, prime time entertainment, interactive educational & museum exhibits and documentaries. He is the winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. Early life Scott Goldstein was born in the Washington Heights (now Hudson Heights) neighborhood of Manhattan. He attended PS 187, Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, and Lake Forest College. His father, Meyer Goldstein, manufactured women's sportswear in New York's garment district. In the early 1950s, facing unauthorized work stoppages by the Teamsters Union, he was approached by and became a reluctant partner with Philadelphia mobster Harry Rosen (a.k.a. ‚ÄúNig‚Äù Rosen) a lieutenant of underworld boss Meyer Lansky. His wife, Lenore Goldstein, was a longtime bookkeeper. Their eldest son, Laurence, was a book critic for The New York Times, a reporter for UPI, a producer for ABC News and NBC News, and co- author of Into Film with Jay Kauffman. He was killed at the age of 36 in a freak electrical accident while adjusting a television set at home in Leonia, New Jersey, on Feb 12, 1972. Career Career in news While a senior at Columbia Grammar, Mr. Goldstein worked after school as a production assistant and writer of the 1am sign-off news at WABC-TV. This led to summer employment as a field producer for ABC news anchor Peter Jennings at the violent demonstrations in Grant Park at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and later as an assistant producer for the ABC News global pool coverage of the first Moon landing. After graduating Lake Forest College as a philosophy major, he worked for the international news film agency Visnews (later Reuters Television) in London where he wrote and edited news stories syndicated to over one hundred countries. After returning to the U.S., he was hired by KING- TV in Seattle as a writer, producer of the noon news, reporter and film critic. In 1973 he was hired by KNBC-TV in Los Angeles as a writer for Tom Brokaw, Tom Snyder and Jess Marlow. Between 1974 and 1976, he produced and wrote the weekend news, election coverage and special projects for KGO-TV San Francisco and served as the station's key producer on the Patty Hearst kidnaping. He wrote and produced the special \\"Patty Hearst : A Case of Coercive Persuasion\\" that aired immediately after her trial ended. In 1976 he was named Special Projects producer for WMAQ-TV Chicago. His ‚ÄúLast Deadline: The Death of the Chicago Daily News‚Äù was nominated for a Chicago Emmy award in 1977 as best news special. In 1978 he returned to Los Angeles as West Coast Producer for the Today Show where he produced and wrote pieces for Jack Perkins, Boyd Matson, Tom Brokaw and Jane Pauley. In 1981 he was named Producer, then Supervising Producer, of the Today Show in New York. He also field produced many of Today's specials including the Royal Wedding of Princess Diana, Today in Prime Time and Today Goes to College at the University of Michigan and Brown University. Primetime television In 1986 he made the switch from broadcast news to prime time drama. For three years he served as producer of the critically acclaimed hit show ‚ÄúLA Law‚Äù; winning two Emmy and Golden Globe awards. He then joined Steven Bochco Productions in launching Doogie Howser, M.D. He was the program's supervising producer for the entire length of the series and directed numerous episodes with star Neil Patrick Harris. After the show ended its run in 1993, Mr. Goldstein formed Scott Goldstein Productions (later SgpMedia). Its first project was a co-venture with the Museum of Television and Radio (now the Paley Center): Science Fiction: A Journey into the Unknown. The two-hour Fox network special, hosted by Dean Cain, Carrie Fisher, Leonard Nimoy, and William Shatner, was the definitive history of science fiction on television and focused on how the genre sheds light on the real world. In 2002, he created one of the first live PBS Interactive Specials, Endgame: Ethics and Values In America, hosted by Carol Marin with Michael Josephson. It enabled viewers to enter the lives of fictional characters forced to make critical decisions with profound moral, ethical or social implications. The program was a combination of a dramatic film, a live studio audience and panel, interactivity on the Web, and sync-to-broadcast technology. It drew its inspiration from ‚ÄúThe Point of View Diner‚Äù; an interactive exhibit he previously created for the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles Multi-media and interactive museum exhibits Mr. Goldstein created most of the core multi-media exhibits for the Simon Wiesenthal Center‚Äôs Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance and New York Tolerance Center. These highly interactive exhibits empower the museum visitors to weigh in on important ethical and political issues. More than 350,000 people, many of them students, visit the museum every year. The exhibits take many shapes and forms: ‚ÄúThe Point of View Diner\\": an interactive experience set in a 1950s style diner with computer input terminals designed as juke boxes. The interactive films deal with situational ethics involving issues ranging from teen age drunk driving to free vs hate speech to gay bullying in high schools. \\"The Millennium Machine\\": a multi-media exhibit set in a futuristic ‚Äútime machine‚Äù. The videos examine the global abuse of women and children, the plight of political refugees, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. ‚ÄúIn Our Times‚Äù: a multi screen look at global genocide throughout the ages with emphasis on human rights abuses in contemporary society, Documentaries Mr. Goldstein produced, wrote and directed the documentary Holocaust for the New York Tolerance Center. The film, narrated by Joe Mantegna, examines the reasons behind the mass slaughter of Jewish citizens and questions how Germany, arguably the world's most technologically sophisticated nation, could be reduced to barbarism. In 2008, he produced, wrote, and directed the documentary Where I Stand: The Hank Greenspun Story. The film, narrated in the first person by Anthony Hopkins, tells the previously untold story of Hank Greenspun, who was one of the last the fire breathing, give-‚Äôem-hell crusading newspaper publishers. His exploits included being P.R. man for Bugsy Siegel at the Flamingo Hotel; a convicted heavy arms runner to the Yishuv during 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War; and an indictment to incite, through his news column, the murder of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Using previously classified government records, the film reveals how Greenspun brought Howard Hughes into Las Vegas to buy out the mob and his secret relationship with the billionaire that led to a break-in at his Las Vegas Sun office by the Watergate burglar s. The film has won best documentary at numerous film festivals. Personal life Mr. Goldstein is married to Susan Tick. The two met in Chicago covering the Presidential election of Jimmy Carter in 1976 and were married two years later. Ms. Tick was formerly a news anchor/reporter for WMAQ and WFYR radio in Chicago.

She was instrumental in having the group investigated by the police in Victoria, Australia. She later wrote a book about her experiences in The Family. Early life and education Moore's biological mother was an unmarried teenager who put her daughter up for adoption in 1969. Moore was adopted by Anne Hamilton-Byrne, a charismatic yoga teacher who gathered a number of followers around her who believed that she was the incarnation of Christ. Moore was meant to be one of the \\"inheritors of the earth\\" after a holocaust took place.Unseen Unheard Unknown, Sarah Hamilton-Byrne (Penguin) 1995, p.1. Hamilton-Byrne had many followers who worked in the medical and nursing professions, and who manipulated the adoption process so that 14 children were adopted by her. These children‚Äîincluding Moore‚Äîwere told that Hamilton-Byrne was their biological mother. Along with the other adopted children, Moore was brought up in houses that were owned by Hamilton-Byrne, who had several properties in various countries (Moore later estimated that Hamilton-Byrne might have been worth $150 million). Moore spent the first four to five years of her life at a house called \\"Winberra\\" in the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, Victoria. After that, she was moved to \\"Kai Lama\\", a group house at Lake Eildon also in Victoria. Life for the children at \\"Kai Lama\\" was unremittingly strict and even brutal. Hamilton-Byrne herself was usually not there, so the children were supervised by women from The Family who were known as \\"aunties\\". These women disciplined the children by inflicting severe beatings for the most trivial reasons or no reason at all.Unseen Unheard Unknown, pp. 46‚Äì64. Another common disciplinary measure was food deprivation. The children lived in fear and were deprived of all love and affection. Despite this, they always hoped for some show of affection from Hamilton- Byrne, who they believed was their mother, and who visited \\"Kai Lama\\" from time to time. They were also led to believe that the world outside was an evil and dangerous place and that they would end up in the gutter or worse if they ever left The Family. Another common form of discipline was the administration of prescription drugs that were obtained by the followers in the medical and nursing professions. These drugs were routinely used to pacify the children. When they were older, they could also be forced to take the hallucinogenic drug LSD as a kind of religious ritual. This was known as \\"going-through\\", and was supposed to promote self-awareness, helping the person to let go of blocks. Moore was forced to \\"go-through\\" in 1984, when she was 15. The experience took place at a property owned by The Family in England, and went on for some days because she was given repeated doses of the drug. She found it a traumatic experience and was later convinced that she had suffered lasting damage from the drug.Unseen Unheard Unknown, pp.139‚Äì150 As Moore grew up, she became more assertive and began arguing with those who supervised the children, including Hamilton-Byrne herself. After arguing once too often, she was expelled from The Family in 1987, at the age of 17. She was then taken in by a family she had met. After a time, she was introduced to a private investigator, known only as \\"Helen D\\", who had been investigating The Family for several years. From Helen D, Moore learnt that Anne Hamilton-Byrne was a fraud and that she herself was not Hamilton-Byrne's daughter at all; she had in fact been adopted.Unseen Unheard Unknown, pp. 168‚Äì169. Helen D introduced Moore to two policewomen who won her confidence; this eventually led to a police raid on \\"Kai Lama\\" on 14 August 1987. A number of children were taken into custody, then placed in care, along with Moore. A number of the \\"aunties\\" faced criminal charges and were eventually convicted of fraudulently obtaining money from the Department of Social Security. In 1990, former group solicitor Peter Kibby started co-operating with police and confessed to forging birth records on orders from Hamilton-Byrne. Former auntie Patricia McFarlane gave information to police about adoption scams. Hamilton-Byrne and her husband Bill were overseas at the time; they were extradited from the United States in 1993 and faced criminal charges, but were only convicted of making false statements in regard to the adoption of Moore and other children. They were each fined $5,000. Career Moore wrote a book‚ÄîUnseen Unheard Unknown‚Äîdetailing her experiences in The Family; it was published by Penguin in 1995. She went on to study medicine and became a qualified doctor, working at a number of Melbourne hospitals. As a doctor, she did extensive volunteer work in India and Thailand (where she worked with Karen refugees on the Thai‚ÄìBurma border), but still returned to Australia, where she carried on a medical practice in the Dandenong Ranges. Legal issues Moore was charged with forging prescriptions of pethidine. In July 2005, she avoided a jail sentence at Ringwood Magistrate's Court in Victoria. She was allowed to remain free as long as she maintained good behaviour for four years and to do community service. She had pleaded guilty to forging prescriptions to obtain pethidine between November 2004 and April 2005. Moore was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Eventually, Moore set up a charity called Barefoot Basics, which aims to provide health assistance to indigenous and displaced people in countries like India. The charity was approved for tax deductible purposes. She did charity work overseas whenever she could afford to make the trip. Personal life In December 2008, Moore was in hospital and lost her left leg as a result of what she considered to be mistreatment by hospital staff after a suicide attempt. She used a wheelchair for the rest of her life. In August 2009, Moore had an emotional reunion with Hamilton-Byrne which was covered by the Herald Sun newspaper. Hamilton-Byrne, who was then 87 years old, said she was now \\"ready to die\\" after being reunited with her \\"favourite daughter\\". The reunion took place at Hamilton- Byrne's sprawling compound at Olinda, Victoria. Hamilton-Byrne said that people who accused her of mistreating the children were \\"lying bastards\\" and she would love to \\"put them right\\" but could not. She stated that she could have sued her critics but had decided against it. Moore said that she loved Hamilton-Byrne but had mixed feelings about her, still regarded her as being responsible for the abuse of the children. Hamilton-Byrne blamed the Aunties. That was as far as Hamilton-Byrne would go in acknowledging any wrongdoing, Moore said; otherwise she was unrepentant. She described Hamilton-Byrne as a powerful and charismatic person and thought that she initially meant well in creating the cult and collecting the children. These acts, she thought, were Hamilton-Byrne's compensation and \\"delusional repair\\" for her own childhood, which involved having an absent father and a psychotic mother. In a 2009 blog post, Moore said that she had decided to see Hamilton-Byrne again after going through a form of therapy called the Hoffman Process, after which she thought it was important to forgive. Moore became a Buddhist in 2009 after meeting a Buddhist lama who inducted her into the belief system of Buddhism. She said this brought her enormous relief and joy and meant that she was now rid of her burden. She felt she now had the support of a teacher/guru (the Buddha), the dharma (a word usually translated as \\"righteousness\\", and denoting the righteous or spiritual path) and the community of Buddhists. This new belief system made sense of her life and gave her a perspective on things, particularly where she had gone wrong by taking on too much, spiritually and emotionally. Having found a guru whom no-one could find fault with, she felt that she had a psychological and spiritual support that she had lacked since she was expelled from The Family. Moore died in May 2016 of heart failure. At her Buddhist-themed funeral, fellow survivors from The Family spoke on her behalf.

GetVidya was founded in April 2007 http://itnewswave.com/their-package-interchange-young- being-deccan-version/ by few students of IIT Bombay and IT BHU. The website is no longer accessible as of June - 2016. GetVidya was an organisation committed to spread education amongst underprivileged and special children of different statures of the society in order to bring them on a common platform with the rest of the society. History GetVidya started with an aim to promote free education to engineering entrance aspirants preparing for IIT JEE, AIEEE, etc. and continued to do so until mid-2010. During this time it gave free study material, online coaching, free tests/quizzes, information on books and exams along with answering doubts of young students online from their hostel rooms. It made several hundreds of videos freely available for students. It got close to 30,000 registered users during this time. Around mid-2010 it started to develop training programs and tools to keep underprivileged children interested in studies. GetVidya developed an interactive educational software, Kiddo, that helps teachers create innovative quizzes and then use it to interactively teach various subjects through computers. The software is highly flexible and the teachers can create their own content, questions, answers etc. This leaves a long lasting impression on the mind of the child and help him retain the information much longer as compared to books. GetVidya distributes this software free of cost and conducts free teacher training sessions so that the teachers can use the software to its fullest potential. It has given this software to a couple of NGOs and more than 40 schools across India. GetVidya also developed another software called Autisto that asks questions and provides answers using only images, animations and sound. This software is targeted to help teach kids with Autism. Autistic kids have significant problems in reading and hence they need special means of teaching through images and sound. GetVidya distributes Autisto free of cost to Autism centers and schools catering to children with special needs. As the software is open source the teacher has immense flexibility to put any image or sound she wishes. This makes learning very empathetic. The teachers can put images related to the kid's parents, siblings and home which helps the kid to relate to these teaching fairly easily. GetVidya has given this software to about 17 autism centers in Bangalore, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. It also does extensive training of the teachers of the centers to ensure they are enabled to fully use the software. Products Kiddo, Autisto, Screamer Team GetVidya was essentially a student run enterprise turned into an organisation focused to help the young kids. The team consisted of young professionals and primarily students from IITs. GetVidya had about 50,000 registered members and had recorded about 1 million page views in September 2011. Recognition GetVidya was praised by many national newspapers such as Deccan Chronicle, Rajasthan Patrika, Indian Express, etc. and other leading social organisations for its work towards needy children.

Sometimes called ferocious water bugs, these brown insects typically are between long, although the dwarf species A. immaculatus (syn. A. cantralli) only is about , making it the smallest North American belostomatid and possibly worthy of separation in its own genus. Otherwise the different Abedus species are very similar and can often only be separated with a microscope. They will bite in self-defense, which is painful but not dangerous. Behavior Members of this genus generally do not fly, and at least some species, including A. herberti, have a greatly reduced flight apparatus and are completely flightless. Despite being essentially aquatic Abedus may travel some distance overland and have been known to abandon streams after heavy rainfalls, allowing them to avoid being swept along in flash floods. Breeding Several Abedus herberti, including both males with eggs on their back and individuals without eggs Giant water bugs exhibit male parental care. In Abedus and other species in the subfamily Belostomatinae (but not subfamily Lethocerinae), the female glues the eggs onto the male's back and the male tends them until the eggs hatch. The eggs are initially yellow-white but gradually change to gray-brown. They can be quite large compared to the size of the adult; in the up to A. herberti of highland streams in Arizona and northwestern Mexico each egg can measure as much as when fully developed. After hatching, the nymphs go through five instar stages before adulthood. Because of the unusual breeding behavior, especially A. herberti is often displayed in zoos, sometimes together with the sunburst diving beetle. These two species also occur together in the wild. Feeding Abedus are sit-and- wait predators that catch small animals, especially invertebrates such as other aquatic insects and snails, but also small vertebrates such as young fish and tadpoles. Small and medium-sized prey items are caught with their strong front legs and stabbed with the proboscis, which injects a saliva that both incapacitates the prey and dissolves it. The largest food category (in A. herberti, animals or more in length) are mostly scavenged. The only prey they regularly catch alive (not just scavenge) in the largest category is nymphs of their own species. Adults are generally highly cannibalistic towards their nymphs and older nymphs often eat younger; adults however only rarely cannibalize other adults.

It involves using green parakeets which are trained to pick up Tarot like fortune cards. The parakeets are trained specifically for this. Fortune telling process A parrot astrologer/fortune teller typically sits beneath a tree to call or by the side of the road where people congregate. He has a cage which contains one or two trained parrots. The tarot like cards are either spread out or stacked in front of him. They are 27 in number representing the Indian cosmic system. Each card contains the image of a Hindu deity and some cards contain images of Buddha or Virgin Mary with Infant Jesus. When a patron sits before the fortune teller, the latter opens the cage and lets the parrot out. He instructs the parrot to pick a card for the patron. The parrot walks over to the cards, picks one from the stack or the spread with its beak and gives it to the astrologer. It then walks back inside its cage. The astrologer opens the card and based on the image tells the fortune of the patron. The practice of Parrot astrology is diminishing in Tamil Nadu due to lack of patronage. In Singapore it is a tourist attraction in Little India along the Serangoon Road. A variant is practiced in Pakistan.

Burma Chronicles () is a 2007 Canadian graphic novel written and illustrated by Guy Delisle. Burma Chronicles is a travelogue about Delisle's time spent in Burma with his young son, Louis, and his wife, Nad√®ge, an administrator for M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF). Originally written in French, the book was translated into English by Helge Dascher and published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2008. Summary The book recounts Guy Delisle's trip to the southeast Asian country which is officially recognized by the United Nations as Myanmar but that is referred to as Burma by countries that do not recognize the military junta that controls it. Delisle went with his infant son, Louis, and his wife, Nad√®ge, an administrator for M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF). At the beginning of the trip, the family must stay in an MSF guest house while they search for more permanent housing. Guy stays home and takes care of Louis while Nad√®ge is frequently absent on MSF business. Guy takes Louis on frequent walks around the neighborhood in his stroller and interacts with local people in Burma. Background Delisle had previously documented his traveling to countries under oppressive regimes in the graphic novels Shenzhen and Pyongyang, which focused on his extended trips to China and North Korea, respectively. Style and themes Burma Chronicles, like Delisle's other graphic travelogues, features a simple drawing style and an acute attention to detail. The book tells mostly slice-of-stories and does not focus on politics. Reception Burma Chronicles was generally well received. The New Yorker, in a short review, praised the book's simple and lively art style and noted Delisle's keen observation of the unexpected. Rory MacLean, in a review for The Guardian, also praised the book's \\"fantastic verve\\" and called it \\"the most enlightening and insightful book on Burma in years.\\" In a review for the Literary Review of Canada, Jeet Heer called Burma Chronicles Delisle's best book. Heer contrasted Delisle's style of travel writing favorably to the \\"hit- and-run style\\" of writers like Thomas Friedman. Steve Duin of The Oregonian also praised the book, saying at the end of his review, \\"Because I've never been to Burma, I don't know that Burma Chronicles is the perfect travel guide to this land of sweltering heat and monsoons. But it is a marvelous graphic memoir of a year in the life in a remote world that is beyond the ability of most readers to grasp.\\" Kirstin Butler of The Atlantic included Burma Chronicles on a list of ten masterpieces of graphic nonfiction. Edith Mirante of The Irrawaddy was more critical of the book, calling Delisle's grasp on Burmese politics \\"literally sketchy\\" and saying that Delisle lacked \\"the black and white bravura of other graphic storytellers such as Marjane Satrapi... or Alison Bechdel...\\".

The stems tend to sprawl along the ground, with the ends densely leafed and upturned. These aloes are centred on the drier western portion of South Africa, and the far south of Namibia. Here they inhabit open, rocky areas and have consequently evolved their decumbent sprawling habit of growth.Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The Aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. Pg 370.

Early life Clark was born in 1882 in Montgomery, Alabama to Robert Clark, a railroad worker originally from Belfast, and Estelle Goodman Clark, a Jewish music teacher originally from New Orleans. The family lived in New Orleans, Louisiana and Pass Christian, Mississippi before moving to Richmond, Virginia in 1894. Clark attended the Virginia Randolph Ellett School and, at age 19, worked as a stenographer to fund art classes at the Art Club of Richmond. In 1906, she went to the New York School of Art on a scholarship, studying under artists including Robert Henri, William Merritt Chase, and Kenneth Hayes Miller. Activism Clark's activist career began in 1909, when she and 18 other women, including Nora Houston, Ellen Glasgow, Lila Meade Valentine, Kate Waller Barrett, and Mary Johnston, founded the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia; she served as its secretary for one year, and also as a committee chair and head of the group's lobby in the Virginia General Assembly. In 1910, she was a delegate to the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Washington, D.C. Clark and Nora Houston would set up also set up their easels at the corner of Fifth and Broad Streets in downtown Richmond to share their \\"street corner sketches\\"‚Äîchalk drawings on rolls of paper that illustrated their oratory. \\"Lots of people made speeches, but we were the only ones sketching, and that really drew crowds,\\" Clark once remembered. During their chalk talks, Clark and Houston spoke about women's suffrage and handed out leaflets to people who approached. When the Art Club of Richmond dissolved in 1917, Clark and Houston opened a studio together. The professional space became known as the \\"Atelier,\\" and its class offerings‚Äîincluding art history, painting, and drawing‚Äîfostered the talents of a new generation of artists, including the painter Theresa Pollak. Two years later, Clark and Houston founded the Virginia Academy of Fine Arts and Handicrafts. In the months before the 1920 elections, when there were threats and rumors of spurious challenges against black women voters, Clark and Houston invited black leaders to their studio to plan ways to confront the issue. They decided that the white suffragists would patrol polling locations in cars. Clark and Houston continued to be involved in the interracial movement after this election. They also participated in art-related activism, campaigning for the resurrection of the Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts, which opened in 1930 as the Richmond Academy of Arts and later became the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. When women were given the vote in 1920, the Equal Suffrage League became the Virginia League of Women Voters, and Clark was its first chair before becoming president the next year. She was its president from 1921 to 1925, and then again from 1929 to 1944. Clark was elected to the board of the National League of Women Voters in 1924 as a regional director, and in 1925 she was elected Second Vice-President, a position she held until 1928. Also in 1928, Clark and Houston bought a house together on Chamberlayne Avenue in Richmond, which came to be known as \\"The Brattery.\\" Government and educational positions Clark also held positions in a number of government and educational bodies, including secretary of Governor E. Lee Trinkle's Commission on the Simplification of State and Local Government and of Governor Harry F. Byrd's Liberal Arts College for Women Commission, and dean of women at the College of William and Mary. During the New Deal, she was a field supervisor for the National Reemployment Service before becoming, in 1936, the director of the Virginia Arts Project in the Works Progress Administration. She was on the Virginia Arts Commission from 1941 to 1964, having helped establish it in 1916. Clark, who also put her campaign for women's suffrage into her artistic work, commented that her art and her activism were related, saying, \\"I've always tried to combine my interest in art with my interest in government.\\" Statue of Adele Clark included in the Virginia Women's Monument. Personal life She met fellow artist Nora Houston at the Art School of Richmond, where she had previously taken classes under Lillie Logan and where she taught after returning to Virginia. Houston became Clark's lesbian life partner until her death in 1942. Soon after Nora Houston died in 1942, Clark's cousin Willoughby Ions, also an artist, moved in with Clark at the Chamberlayne Avenue house she had shared with Houston. Clark, an Episcopalian, converted to Roman Catholicism, Houston's religion, on November 21, 1942.

It began during the Spanish Era until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when Spain finally began to subjugate the Moro people after centuries of failing to do so. Wars during the 1600s Background The Spanish initiated the conflict by conquering the Philippines and invading Moro territory in an effort to subjugate the region to their rule since the 1500s. When the Spanish conquered the Muslim Kingdom of Maynila, a vassal of the Sultanate of Brunei, the Islamic rajah, Rajah Sulayman resisted the Spanish. Manila then became the capital of the Spanish Philippines after the conquest, with the Spanish forcibly converting people to Catholicism. The Spanish‚ÄìMoro Wars started with the Castille War, a war between Spaniards and the Sultanate of Brunei. (The term Moro at this time included Muslim Tagalogs who were ruled by the Sultanate of Brunei). Following the reconquista, a period during which Spanish and Christian culture were restored to those areas of Spain invaded by the Umayyad Caliphate, the Inquisition required Jews and Muslims to convert to Roman Catholicism, or face exile or the death penalty. Thus, the Spaniards tried to suppress Islam in areas they conquered. To this end, they attacked the Moro Muslim sultanates in the south at Mindanao. The Moro Datus and sultans raided and pillaged Spanish towns in the northern Philippine islands in retaliation for Spanish attacks, and terrorized the Spanish invaders with constant piracy. The Spanish were prepared to conquer Mindanao and the Moluccas after establishing forts in 1635, but the Chinese threatened the Spanish with invasion, forcing them to pull back to defend Manila. Several thousand Chinese who were evicted by the Spanish joined the Moros. A source of problems during the Spanish times until the early years of Americans control were the juramentados, referring to Moro swordsmen who attacked and killed aggressors. Although the Spanish defeated the Sultanate of Brunei in 1578, the Spanish did not establish effective control over the Moro sultanates until the late 19th century. The Chinese dominated the economy of the Moro sultanates in the 19th century, controlling trading centers and the shipping trade between other parts of South East Asia and Mindanao. The Chinese sold weapons to the Moro sultanates during this time and the Spanish imposed a blockade to try to stop the supply of rifles from the Chinese to the Moros. Though already diminishing through the years, the Moros maintained their autonomy up to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, after which they fought the Americans in a long insurgency. The Chinese had also rebelled several times against Spanish rule in the Philippines during this period, and the Spanish and Christian Filipinos engaged in massacres against the Chinese out of hatred of the Chinese economic dominance and their numbers. In 1773, desiring to promote better relations between the Spaniards and the new sultan of Jolo, Anda proposed free trade and Spanish help to expel the British from the Moro territory without interference with the internal government of the sultan, but the Spanish officer failed to observe his instructions and nothing beneficial resulted except further irritation of the Moros. About 4,000 Chinese expelled from Manila in 1758 joined the Jolo Moros. Jihad against Spanish invasion The followers of Morog declared a jihad against the Spanish and Filipino Christians, to defend themselves against the Spanish invaders who tried to take over Moro territory. The Moros retaliated with major pillaging campaigns and enslaved Filipino Christians after totally razing their villages. Several Moro sultans led these jihads. They defeated Spanish attempts to conquer Mindanao. The Spanish had use their massive numbers to force the Moros to withdraw. A \\"culture of jihad\\" emerged among the Moros due to the centuries long war against the Spanish invaders. Chinese threat to the Spanish and 1663 Chinese rebellion In 1662, Koxinga's Chinese forces raided several towns in the Philippines and demanded tribute from the Spanish colonial government, threatening to attack Manila if his demands were not met. The Spanish refused to pay the tribute and reinforced the garrisons around Manila, but the planned attack never took place due to Koxinga's sudden death in that year after expelling the Dutch on Taiwan. Koxinga's threat to invade the Philippines and expel the Spanish resulted in the Spanish failure to conquer the Islamic Moro people in Mindanao. The threat of Chinese invasion forced the Spanish to stop their conquest of the Moros and withdraw their garrisons to Manila. Koxinga's death resulted in the invasion being canceled.(Original from the University of Michigan) The Spanish retreated occurred in 1663. Zamboanga and Mindanao became devoid of Spanish soldiers after the Chinese threat against Manila.(the University of Michigan) The Chinese threat effectively destroyed the Spanish plan to conquer and colonize the Moros in Zamboanga.(the University of Michigan) Governor Bobadilla was the one who conducted the evacuation. Mindanao was just about to be colonized by Christians before Koxinga's planned conquest of the Philippines destroyed the entire Spanish plan to conquer Mindanao. Iligan and Zamboanga were given up by the Spanish.(the University of Michigan) Throughout 1656, 1657, 1660, and 1662, the Moros attacked and pillaged towns on Spanish-controlled islands, sailing around the area in order to raid. They defeated Spanish attempts to take the fort of Sultan Kudarat.(the University of Michigan) The Spanish had been on the verge of victory over the Moros, before Koxinga's threat and the subsequent Chinese rebellion against the Spanish resulted in the Spanish forces fleeing from the battle with the Moros to defend Manila against the Chinese. The Spanish Governor General Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera brought soldiers from Peru and Mexico and had defeated the Moro Sultan Kudarat and built forts in Moro territory in Zamboanga, reversing previous Moro successes. The people of Manila were celebrating the victories of the Spanish. Koxinga's threat to the Spanish led to Spanish troops in Moro land being withdrawn by Governor Sebastian Manrique de Lara. After this, the Moros essentially had a free rein to attack the Spanish.(the University of Michigan0 Zamboanga became devoid of Spanish as they fled to Luzon to defend against the threatened invasion. The Spanish and the Moros had signed the Jolo treaty to stop hostilities decades before renewed Spanish-Moro hostilities during Koxinga's planned invasion. Despite the Jolo treaty, the Jolo dato, Salicala, and a dato from Borneo ravaged the Visayan coast. The force of the latter was defeated by Monforte near Masbate, and Salicala returned to Jolo. Monforte destroyed several towns and 300 boats in Borneo. In 1655 trouble again broke out between Corralat and the Spanish forces, the Moros sacking numerous towns in the Calamianes and one town near Zamboanga. In 1656 a fleet dispatched by De Sara, the new captain-general, burned Corralat's town and some Moro towns in Sibuguey Bay, destroying also a Dutch fleet allied with the Moros. The Moros at the same time were ravaging the coasts of Mindoro and Marinduque, and succeeded also in repulsing the attack on the fort at Corralat, forcing the Spaniards to return to Sabonilla and Zamboanga. In 1657 Salicala scoured the Philippine seas, capturing over 1,000 native prisoners, entering the Bay of Manila during the raid. In 1660 Moros from Jolo and Tawi-Tawi, taking advantage of an insurrection in Luzon, raided the costs of Bohol, Leyte, and Mindoro. In 1662 a Chinese rebellion embarrassed the Spaniards, and at this time several datos from the Jolo and Tawi-Tawi islands sacked and burned a great many towns in the Visayas. Following these inroads, Bobadilla, governor of Zamboanga, was ordered to evacuate that station, which was done in January, 1663. For the next half century Moro raids on the Mindanao and Visayan settlements marked each year, and many fights were chronicled between the fleets of praus and the Spanish fleet known as the \\"Armada de los Pintados\\". The Jesuits had endeavored in 1666 and 1672 to have the fort of Zamboanga rebuilt, but it was not until 1712 that the Spanish king ordered its reestablishment, and even then the project was not realized until 1718,(Princeton University) While Governor-General Lara was in office another Chinese invasion threatened. A Chinese chieftain named Koxinga, who had been driven forth from his own country by the Tartars, was the leader of it. When the Tartars overran China, about the middle of the seventeenth century, Koxinga and many of his followers refused to submit. They went to Formosa, drove out the Dutch people, and settled there. Later Koxinga laid a plan to take the Philippine Islands and set up his kingdom there. Koxinga's chief adviser was an Italian friar named Riccio. This friar he had appointed a high mandarin, or nobleman. He now sent him to Manila, dressed in the garb of his office, to demand tribute from the Philippine government. Naturally this demand caused amazement and alarm in Manila. The Spaniards were aghast at the idea of a Catholic priest demanding tribute from a Catholic country, in the name of a heathen ruler. Later the authorities at Rome called the friar to account for his conduct. At this time, however, the Spanish were at a loss how to act. They did not dare send the priest-mandarin away, nor could they give him any answer. They therefore kept him waiting in Manila while they made up their minds what to do. As was usual, when trouble arose, the government thought that the Chinese in Manila were plotting to take the city. They felt sure that these men would be ready to help Koxinga when he came, so everything was made ready for another attack upon the Chinese in Luzon. All government troops, both Spanish and native, were collected at Manila. So great was the fear, that three important forts were torn down, and the soldiers stationed there were brought to Luzon. Only the fort at Caraga, Mindanao, was left standing. This one they did not dare to give up; the soldiers there were all that kept the Moros from destroying the settlements on that coast. A massacre of the Chinese by the Spanish and Filipinos followed during the rebellion. About 5,000 Chinese remained in Manila after the rebellion and massacre. After peace was made, Riccio was allowed to go back to Formosa, to tell Koxinga what had been done. He found the chieftain getting ready to come to Manila with an army to take the country, and Riccio told him what had happened. Koxinga's rage was great when he heard his mandarin's story. He planned to go at once to the islands to punish this wicked cruelty to his countrymen. He fell ill, however, and died of fever before he could start. Thus Manila escaped the fate that must almost surely have fallen upon the city if the Chinese chief and his great army had reached the bay. The foolish attack upon the Chinese took so many Spanish soldiers from the southern islands that the Moros now had free swing along the coasts of Mindanao and the Visayas.(Harvard University) Exalted by his success against European arms, Koxinga resolved upon the conquest of the Philippines. He summoned to his service the Italian Dominican missionary, Ricci, who had been living in the province of Fukien, and in the spring of 1662 dispatched him as an ambassador to the governor of the Philippines to demand the submission of the archipelago. Manila was thrown into a terrible panic by this demand, and indeed no such danger had threatened the Spanish in the Philippines since the invasion of Limahong. The Chinese conqueror had an innumerable army, and his armament, stores, and navy had been greatly augmented by the surrender of the Dutch. After Koxinga's ultimatum, the Spanish proceeded to order all Chinese to leave the Philippines. The Chinese suspected that the Spanish planned to massacre them, so the Chinese rebelled and assaulted Manila to fight the Spanish and Filipinos. The Chinese either died in battle or, escaping by frail boats, joined the Chinese colonists on Formosa. The Spanish razed their own churches and convents in Manila to prevent Chinese from taking shelter in them.(Harvard University) \\"During this period the raids of the Moros continued. These pirates did much damage. This led to efforts on the part of Spain to conquer these warlike people, which resulted in the conquest of Jolo and the establishment of a stronghold at Zamboanga. In 1662 Koxinga, a Chinese pirate, demanded the surrender of Manila. This danger was so great that the Spaniards concentrated all their efforts to resist the threatened invasions and abandoned some of their strongholds in the south. The Chinese in Manila were suspected of feeing in the plot. They assaulted Manila but many were slain and the remainder left the city. The threatened invasion never was carried out for Koxinga died. The effects of the events cited above left Spanish prestige at a low ebb. Manila was no longer the principal commercial centre of the East and never again recovered that position. The century that followed from 1663‚Äì1762 has been described as one of obscurity for the Philippines.\\"(Harvard University)(Harvard University) \\"Another event of importance during the seventeenth century resulted from the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty in China by the Manchus. During the change of power and consequent disorders there, a Chinese adventurer, Koxinga, raised a pirate army in south China and drove the Dutch out of Formosa. He then sent an ambassador to Manila demanding the surrender of the Islands to him. The colony was weak and unprepared for defense, and consequently terrified. There were twenty-five thousand Chinese living in Pari-an, north of the Pasig River, in Manila. Fearful lest these Chinese cooperate in the designs of Koxinga, they were all ordered to leave the Islands. Unable to do so at once, and fearful of massacre, they arose in rebellion and assaulted the city of Manila. The result was a terrible massacre, which cost the lives of twenty-two thousand of the Chinese; the remaining three thousand built frail boats and fled to Formosa. The death of Koxinga occurred before his expedition reached the Philippines.\\"(the University of Michigan) Koxinga's threat to Spain effectively destroyed the Spanish plan to colonize and conquer Molo territory in Mindanao. It was only in 1718 when they came back to the fort which they evacuated. Mindanao was all Moro after the Spanish left.(the University of Michigan)(the University of Michigan) The Sulu Sultanate was also saved due to Koxinga, the Span ish had left La Caldera Fort.(the University of California) In 1662 a Chinese rebellion embarrassed the Spaniards, and at this time several datos from the Jolo and Tawi-Tawi islands sacked and burned a great many towns in the Visayas. Following these iuroads, Bobadilla, governor of Zamboanga, was ordered to evacuate that station, which was done in January, 1663.(Harvard University)(the University of Michigan) For three centuries, intermittent attempts were made by the Spaniards to destroy the homes of tihe Moro pirates, who, almost without exception, raided the Spanish colonies throughout the Philippine Islands, south of Luzon, and even occasionally on that island. Many reverses and some successes were met with by the Spanish expeditions against the JoJo ami Mindanao Moros. The names of some of the Spanish Captains-General who figured in these conflicts, and of the Moro chiefs, would convey no significance to those English-speaking people who have not, during the last six or seven years, participated in Moro campaigns. In 1637 Corcuero inaugurated a new conquest of Jolo and of Mindanao. His force consisted of 76b Europeans. He made a landing at Jolo. The following year, he landed at Zamboanga and proceeded past Cattobats up the Rio Grande against the Dato Corralat and the Datos of Buhayen and Basilan. The following year, Corcuero and Almonte built a fort at Sabonflla, now called Malabang, on Plana Bay. During 1639, Spanish soldiers and priests, under the warlike Recoleto friar, Augustin de San Pedro, led a party of 560 against the Lanao Moros, where Camps Vicars and Keithley now stand. In 1642, Generals Corcuero and Almonte made peace with Corralat, but piratical depredations by the Moros continued; Chinese rebellions embarrassed the Spaniards, who evacuated manv places, and many fights were chronicled between the Moro fleets of Praus and the Spanish fleets.(the New York Public Library) Koxinga's son did not take up the task of invading the Philippines after Koxinga's death.(the University of California) Building of fort on Zamboanga The Spanish built a fort called Real Fuerza de San Jose in Zamboanga under Captain Juan de Chavez in 1635 who led a Christian Spanish Filipino army. Construction started on June 23 of that year.(the University of Michigan) Issue 1 of Ethnology monographs Wars in the 1700s In 1662 a Chinese rebellion embarrassed the Spaniards, and at this time several datus from the Jolo and Tawi-Tawi islands sacked and burned a great many towns in the Visayas. Following these inroads, Bobadilla, governor of Zamboanga, was ordered to evacuate that station, which was done in January, 1663. For the next half century Moro raids on the Mindanao and Visayan settlements marked each year, and many fights were chronicled between the fleets of praus and the Spanish fleet known as the \\"Armada de los Pintados\\". The Jesuits had endeavored in 1666 and 1672 to have the fort of Zamboanga rebuilt, but it was not until 1712 that the Spanish King ordered its reestablishment, and even then the project was not realized until 1718, in which year the present fort, with four bastions, was built and the city walls protected. The place was defended by 61 pieces of artillery. The reestablishment of the Zamboanga station caused great discontent among the Moros. It was besieged for two months in 1720 and 1721 by 5,000 Moros under the dato of Butig. The resistance, directed by the governor, Amorrea, was successful, and the siege abandoned, the Moros turning their efforts to raids on Mindoro and the Calamianes, where great damage was done. In 1724 the Jolo sultan made a treaty of peace with the Spaniards, ceding the island of Basilan. But this same year Manaol, in Mindoro, and Cateel, in Mindanao, were attacked. In 1730 Tay-Tay was sacked and burned by Tawi-Tawi Moros. and the fort at that place unsuccessfully attacked. In 1731 a punitive expedition was sent to Jolo and a number of Moro towns destroyed. In 1734 the Tawi-Tawi Moros attacked and nearly succeeded in capturing Zamboanga. In the same year, and again in 1735, Tay-Tay was again attacked, but the Moros were severely punished in these engagements. In the same year another surprise was attempted at Zamboanga. These actions were supplemented by numerous minor engagements, and were temporarily terminated by a new peace treaty in 1737 with the new sultan of Jolo. In 1746 letters from King Philip V, addressed to the sultans of Jolo and Tamontaca (Mindanao), requesting that the Christian religion be allowed to be preached in their domains, were received, and upon sending embassies to the sultans the project was apparently well received. In 1748 two Jesuit priests took their station at Jolo, but on account of a family quarrel Bantilan. brother of the Sultan, proclaimed himself as ruler of Jolo during the absence of the sultan at Zamboanga. The deposed Sultan came to Manila in 1749, and in 1750 professed a desire to become a Christian. The archbishop of Manila did not believe in his sincerity, but he was baptized at Paniqui, in another diocese. In 1751 the sultan returned to Jolo, escorted by a Spanish force under Antonio de Abad, with the intention of overthrowing Bantilan. The expedition was unsuccessful and returned to Zamboanga. In the meantime a letter was intercepted from the Sultan of Sulu to the Sultan of Mindanao, and its contents established the infidelity and disloyalty of the Sultan Ali Mudin. He, his family, and his followers, numbering over 200, were imprisoned in Manila and Cavite, and a second expedition was sent against Jolo without result. During the succeeding two years the Jolo Moros were unmerciful in their raids, which were most extensive. Paragua. Leyte, the north coast of Mindanao, Romblon, Tayabas, Ticao. Mindoro, Culion. and the Calamianes suffered severely. Two towns in Zambales Province were reached by the Moros. In 1754 the raids were repeated in Mindoro, Leyte, and Mindanao, and extended to Cebu. Negros, and Panay; this year Albay and Batangas provinces also were reached. The Spanish had success in these years. In 1753 a fleet of 150 praus was destroyed, with about 2,000 Moros, and 500 captives liberated. In 1754 the fort at Misamis was built. In 1756 it is reported that 2,500 Moros were killed in an attack on a Spanish galley off Batangas. In 1757 the Moros burned the town of Mariveles, in Manila Bay, as well as several towns in the southern islands and the Calamianes, but lost a fleet from Tuboc in an encounter with Spanish galleys. During these five years the Moro attacks were so persistent and successful that in many of the Visayan towns 50 percent of the inhabitants were killed or enslaved. In 1762 the British captured Manila, and, due to this and the rising of the natives of the northern provinces, the Moros renewed their attacks on the southern islands. Continuing for several years, they sacked and burned towns in Sorsogon, Tablas, Sibnyan, Mindoro, Bataan, and Leyte, and in Surigao and Misamis provinces in Mindanao. Even Manila suffered from the raids during this period, 20 captives being secured in Malate. Malabon and Paranaque were also attacked. In 1771 de Anda, the new captain- general, reorganized the Armada de los Pintados, but the incursions continued. In this year a Spanish friar was captured by a Moro fleet at Aparri, Cagayan. About this time Israel, the son of Ali Mudin, was established in the sultanate of Jolo by the British. In 1773 Anda, desiring to promote better relations between the Spaniards and the new sultan of Jolo, proposed free trade and Spanish help to expel the British from the Moro territory without interference with the internal government of the sultan, but the Spanish officer failed to observe his instructions and nothing beneficial resulted, save further irritation of the Moros. About 4.000 Chinese expelled from Manila in 1758 joined the Jolo Moros; also a number of Englishmen, the leader of whom, named Brun, was put in charge of the defense. In 1775 the Moros destroyed the British colony on Balambangan, led by the dato, Teteng, who later in the year made an attempt against Zamboanga and, upon its being frustrated, committed great ravages upon the coast of Cebu, and continued this for two years. From 1776 to 1778, during the rule of Governor Pedro Sarrio, the Moros harassed the coast as never before. At this time the Sultan Israel, of Jolo was poisoned by AH Mudin, his cousin. In 1778 the \\" Light Fleet\\" dislodged theMoros from their fort at Mamburao, Mindoro, and traffic between Luzon and the southern islands, which had been practically paralyzed for ten years, began to revive. The Sultan of Jolo asked for peace in 1781. In 1781. also, the Mindanao Moros invaded the Visayan Islands, but were defeated. In 1785 the Moros burned several towns in the Visayas and captured a prau in Bulacan Province, near Manila. In 1789 the captain-general, Mariquina, informed the King that constant war with the Moros was an evil without remedy. The governor of Iloilo reported more than 400 persons made captives in two towns. In 1792 Boljoon in Cebu and another town in Leyte were burned and 120 of the inhabitants made prisoners. In 1794 expeditions visited Mindoro. and the Jolo Moros became more peaceful, but the Illanaos, living on the bay of Tubug, in Mindanao, and the natives of Tampassooc, on the west coast of Borneo, made constant raids, not only in the Philippines, but also upon the Dutch islands of Banca and Malacca. In 1794 Siroma, in the Camarines, was attacked and many natives of Daet, in the same province, were carried off. In 1796 the shipyard of San Bias. Mexico, was transferred to Cavite for building the vessels required in the Moro campaigns. From this resulted the naval arsenal at Cavite. In 1796 the naval lieutenant, Arcillos, was captured and put to death at Sibuguey, and the next year Caraga was attacked by the Moros. In 1798 Zamboanga was attacked by the British fleet: and in the same year 500 Moros, with 25 praus, fell upon Baler, Casiguran, and Palanan, east coast of Luzon, capturing 450 people. The headquarters of the pirates for years was on Burias Island, from whence they descended upon the neighboring towns. The Spanish ship San Jose was also captured at Tawi-Tawi by the brother of the Sultan of Jolo. and part of its crew sacrificed. In 1803 the Moros had so ravaged Mindoro that the greater part of the people abandoned the towns for the mountains. In 1793 to 1794 no headway was made against the pirates, while some of their boats made a landing on the coast of Zambales, north of Manila Bay, and escaped without loss. At a meeting of the authorities in Manila and persons of the southern islands, it was shown that each year the Moros captured and enslaved about 500 persons. The expenses from 1778 to the end of 1793 amounted to 1,519,209 pesos fuertes. Six divisions were formed, each of six gunboats and one panco\\" or prau, and the forts of the Visayas, Mindoro, Tayabas, Batangas, and Zamboanga were repaired. Privateering against the Moros was also made permanent.(Harvard University)(the University of Michigan) Wars in the 1800s Map of the approximate extents of the Moro Sultanates in Mindanao in the late 19th century, showing the Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Maguindanao, and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao. In 1805 a treaty was made between the Sultan of Jolo and the Spanish Government whereby it was agreed that no foreign resident would be permitted in Sulu without the consent of the Spanish Government, and that in case of war between Spain and any foreign country the Sultan's ports would be closed against Spain's enemies. From 1806 to 1815 detailed accounts of piratical raids are infrequent. In 1813 a royal order incorporated the privateer fleet of the Philippines with the royal fleet. In 1815 the raiders took 1.000 natives prisoners and captured several Spanish, British, and Dutch vessels. In 1818 twenty-three Moro praus were captured or destroyed in a naval action off the coast of Albay. but later attacks were made by pirates upon Catanduanes Island and some towns of Albay and Camarines. In 1824, at Pilas. 21 miles west of Basilan. a Moro fort was taken and severe losses inflicted upon its defenders, among the dead lying the Dato Ipoypo, called \\"the lash of the Visayas,\\" who each year had carried off more than 500 persons. The expedition also destroyed piratical boats at Jolo, Illana Bay, Polloc, and other parts of Mindanao. From 1827 to 1835 the records respecting Moro conflicts are meager. In 1836, under Salazar, a treaty (mainly commercial) was made with the Sultan of Jolo. In this same year hostile Moros were dislodged from Masbate. In 1842 a fort was erected in Basilan. In April 1843, a convention between the Sultan and the French emissary was made. It stipulated for equal rights of trade between the French and Joloan ports, and a later treaty, dated February 20, 1845, ceded the island of Basilan to Franco for the sum of 100,000 pesos. In 1844 the French war ship Sabine arrived at Zamboanga, and the commander notified the Spanish governor, Figueroa, that he had come to investigate the capture of some of his crew by the Maluso Moros: and later three other French vessels, under Vice-Admiral Cecille, arrived and blockaded the island of Basilan, the offender being the Dato Usak. A Spanish force under Bocalan went immediately to Zamboanga, and soon the French raised the blockade. A Spanish fort was built at Pagsanjan, Basilan. Later the Davao country was ceded to the Spaniards by the Sultan of Mindanao. The Davao settlement was made by Jose Oyanguren, who, in 1849, took the fort of Hi jo. In 1845 a Spanish frigate left Manila for Zamboanga, and from there proceeded to the island of Balanguingui, of the Samales group, where an anchorage was made at the principal port. Colonel Penaranda, secretary to the civil governor of the Philippines, tried to communicate with the dato of the island, but in place of this was ordered to leave at once, and the Moro fort fired upon the Spanish frigate. A landing was made, but the party was obliged to retire with the loss of some men and Commander Rodriguez. At this time this island was the center of piracy in the archipelago, and the visit of the Spanish vessel was to ascertain its means of defense. In 1848 the English-built steam gunboats El Cano, Magallanes, and Reina de Castilla, with three barkentines, carrying three companies of troops, went to Balanguingui, which was still a center of piracy. The expedition, headed by Claveria in person, anchored off Balanguingui, and an attack was made. After a cannonade from the vessels, three companies and 150 Zamboanga volunteers assaulted the walls and carried the fort after a desperate resistance, the Moros losing 100 killed. The Spanish lost 7 killed and 50 wounded. The next day another fort was captured in the same manner. 340 Moros being killed and 150, mostly women and children, being taken prisoners. The Spaniards lost 1 officer and 15 men killed, 224 wounded, and 22 contused. Seventy-nine pieces of artillery were captured in the two forts and 30 captives rescued. Two smaller forts were also taken, and the towns of Buasugan, Suitan, Pahat, and Padanan destroyed. In 1848 two Dutch corvettes, being denied the return of some captives by the Sultan of Jolo, cannonaded the forts there for twenty-four hours. In 1849 the British war ship HMS Meander, Captain Kepple, with Sir James Brooke, the founder of Sarawak, on board, made a treaty with the Sultan of Jolo in which the Sultan promised not to recognize any other power as his suzerain without the consent of Great Britain. Later in 1849, 3,000 Moros from Jolo attacked the fort of Isabela de Basilan, but were repulsed. The prisoners taken were conducted to Zamboanga and a notice was sent to the Sultan of Jolo concerning the capture and punishment of his subjects. A Moro fleet from Tonquil, together with some praus, in 1850, raided the islands of Samar and Camiguin, carrying off 75 natives. The old and the children were thrown overboard as useless. A Spanish fleet then went to Jolo. The place was defended by five cotas or forts. It was also fortified by a wall and was well supplied with cannon. The population numbered some 7,000 people, of whom 500 were Chinese. Two officers sent to arrange an interview were fired upon by Moros after embarking. The place was deemed to be too strong for attack by the force present and the Spanish commander decided to return and await reinforcements: but the forts, without notice, opened a general fire upon the fleet at anchor, killing 7 and wounding 4 sailors. The fleet replied, but soon returned to Zamboanga. The El Cano was sent to Manila with the news. Reinforcements arrived and the expedition returned to Jolo, capturing the place after a spirited action. The Spanish lost 3 killed and 92 wounded, while the Moros had 300 killed and lost over 100 cannon. The fall of Jolo was not without effect. Numerous small expeditions to various Mindanao datos and sultans were well received. In April 1850, the governor of Zamboanga went to Jolo, and on the 19th the Spanish flag was raised. The same day, in a treaty, the Sultan acknowledged the sovereignty of Spain, and agreed not to make treaties, conventions, and alliances with European powers, companies, persons, corporations, nor with any sultan or chief, and all treaties previously made with other powers were declared null and void. The Sultan also agreed to use no flag but that of Spain, and the Spanish governor guaranteed to respect the religion of the Moros. Piracy was also declared to be prohibited. A salary of 1,500 pesos was allowed to the Sultan, 600 pesos to 3 datos, and 360 pesos to the \\"sheriff\\" for his services to the Spanish Government. This treaty was dated and signed April 19, 1851. Notwithstanding the promises of the Sultan, pirate vessels continued to scour the remote parts of the archipelago. Five small Spanish vessels encountered a Moro fleet of 4 praus on the southwest coast of Paragna. One of the Spanish vessels was blown up, but the pirates were defeated with a loss of 100 dead. The Spaniards lost 14 killed and 12 wounded, but rescued 20 captives from the Moros. In 1852 a general rebellion broke out in Sugut near Polloc. The Spanish attacked the fort and killed 50 of the Moros. In January 1854, a company of the Principe Regiment was ambushed in Basilan and nearly all killed. In this same year a town on Capul, near Jolo, was burned by the Spaniards from Basilan; but in 1855 the Moros from Sulu made a dash upon Zamboanga and burned the best part of the town. In 1856 a Spanish expedition burned a town of Jolo for piracy, also one in the islands of Simisa and one on Basilan. In 1857 the gunboat Reina de Castillo, 150 soldiers, and 50 Zamboanga volunteers destroyed 2 villages near Zamboanga. In 1858 General Norzagaray offered premiums to whomsoever should kill any pirate wherever found, but this was of no important result. In this year the \\"light fleet\\" of Isabela de Basilan sailed for Simisa, where it surprised the Moros and after a hard fight put them to flight. Seventy-six captives were rescued and 116 prisoners taken, among them the families of two powerful datos. In view of the state of the island and the captivity of their people the two chiefs presented themselves at Basilan with 60 captives, one a priest and another a European woman, and in view of their submission the governor made an exchange of prisoners. In 1860 the Moros established themselves on the islands of Catanduanes and Biti and others belonging to the province of Albay, the governor of the province being unable to dislodge them. They also infested the straits of San Bernardino between Luzon and Samar, their number being between 400 and 500, where they killed some 16 persons, captured 10, and carried off a vessel. The same year two piratical datos of Dong-Dong in Tawi-Tawi were killed by the dato Alip and their heads carried to Zamboanga. In 1860 the Moros attempted to seize a vessel lying at anchor at Tuluyan, and in the attempt 3 of them were killed. The Spanish officer wrote an arrogant letter to the Sultan demanding the return of 2 Spaniards and 200 natives within six days, and the Sultan acceding Bent 12 vessels to Tawi-Tawi to repress some of the pirate datos. In 1861, 18 steam gunboats were purchased in England, and it was due to these boats that the almost continued piracy which had existed up to that time was soon reduced to insignificance. In 1862 Samales Moros made raids on the Zamboanga coast, but the raids ceased when a small gunboat sank a large prau with all of its crew. At the same time a small fleet forced the Sultan of Mindanao to hoist a Spanish flag at Polloc. The Moros met reverses in loss of fleets near Guimaras and Tugubanjan islands and in the destruction of the four towns Ponugan, Bugamputi, Patan, and Caneanga. In September 1864 an expedition was sent from Polloc against the Rio Grande Moros, who had built defenses on that river from Cotabato to Tumbao. The fort at Pagalungan was captured, with a severe loss to the Moros. In the report of this assault honorable mention was made of Ensigns Cervera and Montijo, afterwards Spanish admirals. In this year the Talayan Moros were proceeded against, the Spanish being aided by a force under Dato Uto, son of the Sultan of Buhayan, but during the attack Uto joined the Talayan Moros, and the expedition failed. A second expedition also failed, and the outlying fort at Bongao was abandoned. In 1866 the Moros of Supangan and Simuay rose in rebellion, and the governor of Mindanao, with a force and four gunboats, proceeded against the fortified towns of Supuangan, Dulugan, and Sanditan. The expedition was entirely successful, with but slight loss. In 1870 a raid was made by Tawi-Tawi Moros on the east coast of Paragua. The town of Santa Monica, or Batacalan, was destroyed and all of its inhabitants carried away. Two years later a garrison of native troops was placed at Puerto Princesa. In this year a naval blockade of Jolo was established, and in 1873 two German vessels were seized while carrying contraband of war to the Jolo Moros. In 1874 this fleet did considerable damage to the Moros of the islands from Jolo to TawiTawi. Toward the close of the same year a large party of Moros attacked the garrison at Balabac, but were repulsed. In October 1875, two gunboats in search of Moro pirates located their headquarters in the Bay of Areray and sank one large prau. These operations practically terminated the long term of piracy under which the colonies had suffered for three centuries. The mobility of the steam gunboats and the subsequent blockade against introduction of arms and ammunition had in a dozen years practically removed the menace, though occasionally raids appeared in the years to follow. Most of the trouble in the succeeding years, however, took the form of more or less extensive campaigns against the three large groups of Moros (Sulu, Rio Grande, and Lanao) in the control of the fanatical running amuck, called by the Spaniards \\"juramentado.\\" Campaign of 1876 In 1873 Spain had largely reorganized her Philippine forces, and in 1876 the forces included seven native regiments of infantry and one of artillery, two regiments of the civil guard, and some force of carbineers and marines. There were also troops at Balabac, Isabela de Basilan, and Cavite. The relations between the Government and Di Amirul, the Sultan of Jolo, had been becoming more and more tense, and an extensive expedition was planned against the Sultan by the captain-general in 1876, in spite of Spain's political troubles at home and the depleted condition of the treasury. The projected expedition was received with great enthusiasm in the city of Manila and throughout Luzon, especially by the great religious orders. The fleet of 10 steamers leaving Manila early in February was reinforced at Zamboanga and proceeded with 11 additional transports and miscellaneous vessels under the escort of 12 gunboats to Bacungan, where anchorage was made on February 20. The captain-general was in command and was accompanied by the admiral in command of naval forces. On the 22d a landing was made at Paticolo, about a league northeast of Jolo, the fleet silencing the ineffectual Moro resistance. Malcampo, the captain-general, ordered a half brigade to remain at Paticolo with the engineer section and a mountain battery, with directions to march upon Jolo the following day in order to unite with the force which the captain-general would lead into the interior to flank the Moro stronghold. The plan proved nearly fatal to the turning column. It was lost in the thick woods and was unable, on a very hot day, to find water. The following afternoon, harassed by the Moros and nearly perishing from thirst, the column reached the shore at Tandu, where it united with that left at the beach, which had not been molested in the least. The captain- general, loth to abandon his plan of attacking Jolo from the interior, finally decided to attack by the shore. The army advanced at daylight on the 29th, the fleet opening upon the forts at the same time. At 9 a heavy rain came on and lasted an hour, at the end of which time a brigade advanced against the forts of the datos Daniel and Ubico. The vanguard was led by the First Regiment, and the brigade commander was the first to set foot upon the enemy's works. After a sharp fight the forts were captured by the Spaniards, and the entire force advanced. The Moros in the forts of the Sultan and the Dato Tanquan made a fierce resistance, and two colonels fell wounded; but the last works were carried by an assault of the Spanish artillery battalion, Jolo remaining in undisputed possession of the Spaniards. On the following day a half brigade, with 4 naval guns, took the fort of Panglima Arab, situated in a wood about 1 kilometer from the shore. The town of Liang was also burned, and a small expedition destroyed 80 boats and burned 90 houses on Tapul Island, besides killing some Moros; and an expedition under General Sanchez destroyed the town of Lacul-Palac, 3 kilometers in the interior from Jolo. The \\"cota\\" at Parang was taken, and later Maibun was taken by a landing party from the fleet under Lieutenant Ordonez. A fort called Alphonso XII was erected on the site of the \\"cota\\" of the Dato Daniel, and a redoubt named \\"Princesa de Asturias\\" upon that of the \\"cota\\" of Panglima Arab. Between the two a camp was formed called \\"Our Lady of Victories.\\" The fort of Alphonso XII was soon completed and 2 infantry regiments, one company Spanish artillery, another of engineers, the 2 disciplinary companies of Balabac and Puerta Princesa. and the \\"prisoners' brigade\\" were designated as the garrison of Jolo. Capt. Pascual Cervera was made politico-military governor of the island. General Malcampo was given the title of \\"Count of Jolo\\" and \\" Viscount of M;ndan;io.\\" many decorations were given, and a medal was struck for each participant in the campaign. The Moros made frequent attacks in a small way and resented the occupation of the capital. These attacks were repeated in greater force in April and May, but were repulsed in both cases. Fevers decimated the garrison, and even in September the sick numbered 340. In 1876 there began a series of diplomatic negotiations between Spain, on the one side, and Great Britain and the German Empire, on the other, respecting Spanish sovereignty in Jolo and on the north coast of Borneo, which was not concluded until the protocol of Madrid on March 7, 1885, by which the sovereignty of Spain relinquished any claim to the territories occupied by the British North Borneo Company. It is, however, of interest to note that the British North Borneo Company is the outgrowth of an American company founded in August 1865, under the name of \\"The American Trading Company of Borneo,\\" under a concession from the Sultan of Brunei. Among the most important documents of this period may be cited the Madrid protocol of March 11, 1877, between Great Britain, Germany, and Spain, giving free trade and equal rights with Spaniards at Jolo to British and German subjects: the treaty of the Sultan of Jolo and his datos submitting to Spain, signed at Licup (Jolo) July 22, 1878; the letter of incorporation of the British North Borneo Company, dated London, November 7, 1881; and the Anglo- German Spanish protocol of 1885. In September 1877, a determined assault was made on the Jolo garrison by about 2,000 Moros. After three days of fighting, in which they destroyed some property, they were driven off. The treaty above mentioned, establishing Spanish sovereignty in the Sulu Archipelago, was signed by the Sultan and Colonel Martinez, the governor, at Licup, Jolo, in 1878. In this same year the Dato Uata Mama and his followers assassinated several Spaniards at Tamontaca, Mindanao, among them the judge of the first instance, an army surgeon, a lieutenant, and several soldiers. The act was treacherously carried out while the Spaniards were holding a conference with the Moros. This crime was never punished, the dato dying of cholera in 1882. In 1878 was also recorded the first case of \\"juramentado.\\" The fanatic attacked and wounded 6 men in the marine barracks at Jolo before he was dispatched. This was the first of a long list of similar attacks at this station, which are detailed briefly below to show the extent to which these outrages grew: In 1878, 1 man in public square of Jolo killed 7 and wounded 6 natives, and then escaped. Six men made an attack injuring 1 Chinaman and 2 Moros; 4 were killed, 2 escaped. February 9, 1 Moro wounded 5 men, and was killed. March 3, 1 Moro wounded 3 men, and was killed. September 16, 1 Moro wounded 2 sentinels, and was killed. September 29, 4 Moros wounded 2 missionaries, and 2 were killed. November 25, 13 Moros entered Jolo with arms concealed in bamboo water tubes: 11 were killed by the troops, but not until 13 persons had been wounded. In 1880, March 30, 40 Moros from Looc attacked a Spanish party, killing 2 soldiers and wounding 8. Twelve of the Moros were killed. This attack was punished by the Sultan, who was awarded the \\"Cross of Isabel\\" by the Spanish Government for the service. In 1881, February 16, 2 Moros were killed in the Jolo trenches after killing a native soldier. February 19, 4 Moros attacked the Jolo lines, wounding a Spanish ensign, and all were killed. March 26‚Äì28, similar attacks were driven off without loss to the troops. August 29, 3 Moros lost their lives at an outpost, killing 1 soldier and wounding 4. September 19, 8 Moros killed 1 soldier and wounded several near Jolo, themselves escaping. In 1882, September 12, 3 juramentados in the Jolo market wounded 11 soldiers and a native, being killed by the troops. September 14, 3 Moros wounded a soldier and a native before being dispatched. September 20, a small band lost 7 killed in an attack upon an outpost. To suppress these outrages the settlements in which most of them originated, Looc and Boal, were destroyed in October and November 1882, by expeditions from Jolo, and severe losses were inflicted on the Moros by the troops. Nevertheless, in July 1883, three juramentados in the square of Jolo killed 2 officers and a soldier and wounded an officer and 2 soldiers; 2 of them succeeded in escaping. Later 12 Moros attacked 8 soldiers who were cutting wood near Jolo, and all but two escaped. In addition to these assassinations a well-organized attack on the garrison at Jolo was made in April 1881, but it was successfully repulsed. On the death of the Sultan a few days later the attack was repeated with the same result. The \\"juramentado\\" fanaticism was not confined to Jolo. The following cases are recorded among the Rio Grande Moros: November 1881, one Moro wounded 1 of the mothers of the Moro Orphan Asylum at Tamontaca; he was later beheaded by the Moro Raja Muda. June 8, 1882, during a religious parade at Cotabato a juramentado beheaded a soldier and wounded another and 2 women before being dispatched by the troops. Soon after another killed 2 soldiers near the Taviran fort. In 1882 Spanish detachments occupied the stations of Bongao, Siassi, and Tataan. In 1884 a tour of the Southern Islands was made by the governor-general, de Jovellar, and he reported as follows to the colonial minister: \\"The enterprise of occupation is completely paralyzed, and either on account of insufficient means or a badly followed system twenty years have been lost. There is nothing, in effect, further from signifying a proposition of permanence and improvements than the state of all our establishments. There hardly exist the ruins of the buildings formerly erected. At Polloc the old fort and barracks have both completely disappeared. The fort at Cotabato has also completely disappeared, not one stone remaining upon another, and the smaller forts of Libungan, Tumbao, Taviran, and Tamontaca, upon one side or the other of the two arms of the river, could not be more temporary. The troops are badly quartered at all places‚Äîin buildings either honeycombed by the white ants or threatening to fall in ruins. In Cotabato the ammunition has become useless on account of the lack of a magazine, and the ordnance supplies and commissaries of the military administration for the garrison are stored in a rented house. Nothing exists in that part of Mindanao to indicate a fixed occupation or thought of permanency except the continued renewal of the troops; each day under worse conditions.\\" On January 26 General Jovellar returned to Manila, and as a consequence of his representations 100,000 pesos were authorized in the budget of 1885‚Äì86 for the construction of a fort for one company, a storehouse, a hospital, and a magazine at Cotabato. On February 22, 1884, Badurudin, the Sultan of Jolo, died at Maibun without issue. The council at once divided on the succession, the factions favoring Raja Muda Amilol, a youth of 14, and Dato Aliubdin, respectively legitimate son and brother of Diamarol, the preceding sultan. Each faction proclaimed its candidate sultan, at the same time notifying General Parrado, governor of Jolo. The latter preserved a neutral attitude, informing the captain-general of the condition. The proposition from the captain-general that Amilol should be sultan, but under the regency of Aliubdin until his majority, was refused by both factions, and two sultans reigned in Jolo, the boy Amilol, under his mother at Maibun, and his uncle, Aliubdin, at Paticolo. In April of the same year a similar condition of affairs followed the death of the Sultan of Mindanao. Dato Utto having proclaimed his protege, Mamuku, the new sultan, the other datos protested, favoring Mamucpun, of Sibuguey, brother of the late sultan's widow. Following the protest, the Spanish influence favored Mamucpun. In June of this year a royal order conferred on the sultans of Jolo and of Mindanao the honors of a lieutenant general, without command, and the title of \\"Very Excellent,\\" and salutes were decreed them upon visiting warships. Campaigns of 1886 and 1887 against Rio Grande Moros In Mindanao, Datu Uto had gradually become the most powerful chief upon the Rio Grande. The datos of the lower Rio Grande were harassed continually, and Uto even appeared defiantly before Cotabato with 80 war canoes, an insult to which the garrison was obliged to submit in silence in compliance with a decree forbidding aggressions upon Moros except in self-defense. Later some slaves of Uto escaped to Cotabato, and as they were not returned to him by the Spanish authorities he sent one of his followers into the town to kill one of the fugitives, the order being carried out. The district judge endeavored to secure Uto for trial, but the governor was unable to bring the dato before the court, and upon referring the matter to Manila the captain-general desired the judge to quash the case. When the judge refused he declared martial law and had the judge ordered to Manila, and later abolished the judicial district of Cotabato. Uto became more inimical to and defiant of the Spanish power, and a small expedition was sent against him composed of disciplinarios and troops, the former by land and the latter by gunboats, but the result was unfavorable to the Spanish. Then the Moros burned the Jesuit mission house at Tamontaca, the town of Amadeo, the infantry barracks, the coal sheds of the navy, and other buildings of the garrison of Cotabato, also other buildings on the Rio Grande. Notwithstanding these troubles, General Julian Serina, governor of Mindanao, had an interview with Uto and made an effort to arrange matters peaceably with him, but without satisfactory result, although some escaped slaves were returned to him and he was also paid for alleged losses sustained. Serina then decided to use force, and cited Uto for an interview at Bacat, but receiving no answer troops were ordered to Bacat and the place occupied. The strategic position of Bacat, situated at the junction of the Bacat and Rio Grande rivers, was such that its permanent occupation would control the entire delta. A force was then formed to occupy the forest of Buhayen; small garrisons were left at Polloc and Tamontaca and 300 men at Cotabato. Two columns of about 300 men each were formed for the advance, moving up the river by steam vessels, no resistance being encountered except at ineffective long range. A landing was made near the wood of Kinodal, where several \\"juramentado\\" attacks were made on the troops. A sharp fire being opened from the woods, the Spanish replied, and in the resulting engagement lost one killed and seven wounded, the Moros losing fifty killed and wounded. The expedition returned to Bacat, where the Moros attacked from the right bank of the river. A force crossed and dispersed them, leaving a detachment to protect the crossing. Moro houses in the vicinity of Bacat were destroyed, and, leaving a garrison of 500 to hold Bacat, the remaining troops were withdrawn to Cotabato. On March 30 a small column left Cotabato and defeated the Moros at Tamontaca with a loss of 15 killed, and a few days later sank four Moro armed vessels in the backwater of Sapacan, 10 others escaping, but leaving 20 dead, among them the Dato Ladialam. The approach of the rainy season made it impossible to carry out further operations, and General Serina reported what had been accomplished to the captaingeneral. The latter, upon receiving the report, resolved upon an immediate campaign in person, and so advised Serina, at the same time hiring several vessels, whose arrival at Zamboanga in the rainy season with troops, supplies, commissaries, and forage filled the garrison with astonishment. General Serina, seeing that the greater part of the supplies would be lost by the wet weather, and that a campaign during the rainy season would only result in heavy losses for the Spanish forces, left Zamboanga late in September 1886, for Manila, where he persuaded General Terrero to wait until the end of January or the beginning of February before making an advance. Upon his return to Zamboanga, Serina transferred his headquarters to Cotabato, where he arrived November 14. On the 15th he sailed in the Bacolod for a trip up the Rio Grande, preceded by a gunboat, 130 soldiers, and some 20 officers as guard. The steamers, joined by 2 gunboats, continued the voyage to Bacat. They were fired upon several times during the trip up and once while returning. On the 20th it was learned that the Dato Sanhuan, an ally of the Spaniards, had been assassinated by partisans of Uto, and that the latter was preparing forts and defenses against the threatened campaign. On December 6, 300 men reinforced Bacat. On the same day the followers of Dato Ayunan revenged themselves at Talayan for the killing of his brother Sanhuan, killing 7 of Uto's followers, 2 of whom were datos. On December 10, 500 men reinforced Cotabato. On January 1, 1887, Tumbao was occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Matos with about 300 men from Cotabato and a company of engineers from Libungan. A few days later Lieutenant-Colonel Holguin followed with troops from Zamboanga and Cotabato, and two forts were constructed at a bend in the Rio Grande, 10 miles from Tumbao and 3 from Bacat. Meanwhile, General Terrero had prepared his expedition, and early in January sailed from Manila with a force composed of 5 infantry regiments, 3 companies of artillery, 2 squadrons of cavalry, 300 disciplinarios, and 8 field and 2 siege guns. After a short stop at Zamboanga the expedition sailed for Polloc, where several gunboats had assembled. On the 14th three transports were sent with troops to Forts Bacat, Liong, and Piramide without a single Moro being seen. On the 19th the cavalry, marines, and some artillery were also taken to Bacat. To compose the expedition ships and troops had been drawn from throughout the archipelago, less than 1,000 men remaining to guard Manila, and not a gunboat or a soldier, except of the civil guard, being left in the Visayas. In Jolo. where hostilities were commencing. Colonel Arolas had but 320 men. Considerable discontent was apparent in Manila from this situation. The field forces were organized into two columns, the first under General Serina and the second under Colonel San Felin. Serbia's force numbered 1,182 men, with 6 field pieces and 4 siege guns; the column of San Felin was 1,129 strong, with 4 field pieces; 1.100 men were retained to garrison the ten forts or stations of Cotabato, Polloc, Libungan, Tumbao, Taviran. Tamontaca, Liong, Piramide, Bacat, and Kudaranga, a total of 3,411 men in the Rio Grande region. On the 26th two columns advanced along the \\" estero\\" of Bacat, one numbering 320 men and the other 330. The launch of the Aragon, towing two boats filled with soldiers, steamed along the stream, and many obstacles were removed from the channel. Like work was also done on the 27th and the 28th. On the afternoon of the 28th General Terrero directed a force of 460 men. with 3 guns, to bombard the forts of Saliling from the estero of Buhayen. The Moros replied with cannon, \\"lantacas,\\" and rifles, but without effect. On the 29th two columns opened a road for 7 Whitworth guns, which opened fire on the forts on the 30th, the bombardment continuing on the 31st. On February 2 a general advance was made by three columns under General Terrero and Colonels San Felin and Matos, that under the captain-general being composed almost entirely of Spaniards, the others being composed largely of native troops. These forces arrived within sight of the forts of Saliling almost without resistance from the enemy, but about 4 p. m. a torrential rain turned the camp into a swamp. As the torrents of rain continued, the troops were obliged to take refuge at the camp of Reina Regente, the supplies being considerably damaged. A sand battery was built, guarded by 2 guns, and remained garrisoned by 1 company and 20 disciplinarios. Although up to this time the losses had been but 1 artilleryman killed and 2 wounded by the explosion of a gun charge, the hospitals were filled with sick owing to the exposure. On the 9th, the storm having ceased, the captain-general advanced and made his headquarters at the wood of Kinodal, the front being covered by the column of Matos and the left by that of San Felin. Eleven cotas (forts) at Lintunkan impeded the march and on the 11th were bombarded by 5 Krupp and 4 Plasencia guns, a general advance being made by daylight on the 12th. The vanguard was formed of 2 companies and 120 disciplinarios, under Major Villabrille; the left by General Serina, a column of 3 regiments and the sailors from the Aragon; the right by Colonel San Felin's column of portions of 2 regiments and sailors f 'om the gunboats, General Terrero's headquarters being escorted by a section of engineers and a squadron of cavalry. The condition of the ground greatly retarded the column by delaying the cavalry. Upon arriving at the backwater or \\"estero\\" of Lintunkan 16 forts or \\"cotas\\" were discovered, but as the greater number were without defenders they were occupied after a very slight resistance from a few forts. The Spanish loss was 1 killed, 1 drowned, and several native soldiers wounded in the feet by bamboo stakes. On the 13th the sacred grove was occupied, the troops wading to the waist in water the greater part of the time and driving the Moros before them at the grove. The Spanish loss was 6 killed and 17 wounded. The forces returned to Camp Reina Regente. A white flag was hoisted on the first fort of the Dato Kabalo, and after more than two weeks of negotiations the Dato Silungan, paternal uncle of Uto, presented himself to Terrero in the name of Uto, and on March 10 returned with the conditions of peace signed by Uto, his wife Radja Putri, the Sultan of Bacat, and others. General Terrero then returned to Manila, arriving on March 21, where he was received with great honors and congratulated by the Madrid Government. The expedition is said to have cost over 1,000,000 pesos, part of the funds being taken from the fund of 3,000,000 pesos set aside for the harbor works of Manila, which were greatly crippled thereby. The number of sick was very great, some 680 having been sent to Zamboanga or Manila. Campaigns of 1886‚Äì87 at Jolo The situation in regard to the Jolo sultanate, previously described, was further complicated in January 1885, by the application at Manila of the Dato Harun, of Paragua, uncle of Amilol and cousin of Alinbdin, and the only living Moro signatory of the 1878 treaty, for support in his candidacy for the sultanate. He was informed by the governor-general that his full and spontaneous election by the council of Jolo datos would be recognized, whereupon he returned to Paragua, promising that it should be so. The early part of 1886 passed quietly at Jolo, Colonel Arolas having become governor of that station, In September General Terrero resolved to intervene actively in the disputed sultanate question, and announced Dato Harun as the Sultan or Jolo at a reception at the Malacanan palace in Manila, the reasons given for this action being that Amilol. aided by his mother, was gaining the ascendancy and that his accession had been rendered possible by his mother's crime of poisoning both her husband and the late Sultan Badarudin. In October Harun sailed for Jolo, where he was received by Colonel Arolas. Not being supported by the Jolo datos, it was necessary, under General Terrero's order, for the Spanish troops to give him active support. Accordingly, an expedition of 200 men, with a gunboat, escorted Harun to Parang, where he was received as sultan, but he soon retired to Jolo. Later it was learned that the Moros of the rancheria of Maibun were attacking those of Parang, and Arolas, in company with Harun, made another expedition to Parang on November 2, where several more datos swore allegiance to him; but on December 18 it became necessary to send a gunboat, with 150 men, against the rancheria of Bauisang. which was taken by the troops, the Moro leader, Ambut, being killed in the fight. Tajil, a partisan of Harun, was relieved and the fort of Bauisang destroyed. Early in January 1887, an expedition was sent with a launch and 40 soldiers against Maibun, where two Moros were killed, and against the settlements of Tamparan and Tuyat, which were destroyed. In this same month an expedition destroyed the settlement of Tumahan and Taudic Bunha. Both of these expeditions were accompanied by the new sultan. At Siassi the governor, Rossi, attacked and destroyed Dato Gran's fort, about 3 miles from Siassi, on January 22; 14 Moros were killed in this fight. By February 1, the Jolo situation was critical. More than half the garrison had been withdrawn for the Rio Grande expedition, leaving less than 300 men to garrison the town and Fort Alphonso XII. The most important datos had joined Amilol Quiram, and about 3,000 hostile Moros infested the neighborhood of Jolo, making it almost impossible for the garrison to rest day or night. During the first week in February five nights were spent by the Spaniards in momentary expectation of an attack, and the situation became most critical. The Moros of Tawi-Tawi, Tatang, Bongao, and Tapul were also in arms, as well as those of Siassi. In the latter island the fort was attacked on the 10th and 12th, but the assailants were driven off with a loss in both cases. At Torre Resina, on the Island of Lapac, opposite Siassi, a small garrison of 9 men was attacked by a large force of Moros on the 13th, one being killed and another wounded in the first attack, and later sustaining a siege of three days from 300 Moros, until relieved by a force of 56 men from Siassi, under Capt. Fernandez. In the siege the Moros lost 30 killed; the garrison 1 wounded. The Mindanao campaign was terminated in March, and the Jolo garrison returned, and on March 12 the strength was about 400. A further reenforcement arrived from Zaniboanga in April. It was ordered that the troops should embark at midnight for an expedition. The artillery started with the expedition, but a deep ravine made its return to Jolo necessary. At daybreak the Moros commenced to fire upon the troops, and in turn the Spaniards burned the houses along the trail, both in order to signal their advance to the fleet and to repress the activity of the Moros. At noon the expedition arrived in sight of Maibun, beyond which lay the Spanish fleet at anchor. The principal fort formed a quadrangle about 80 meters square. The north face, which was the one to be assailed, being of coral rock and 2.V meters in height. The south face fronted the sea and had been strengthened with a double parapet of tree trunks over 4 meters in height and five embrasures for cannon, each well protected. The east and west sides were protected fully by timber, swamp, and river and were weaker in construction, but an attack there was impracticable. In the interior of the fort was the sultan's palace, a ten-sided building upon high, wooden pillars, and two smaller buildings. The Spanish advance formed in line at the river, some 300 meters from the fort; 2 companies of the Second Regiment, the rifle section, and second company of disciplinarios formed the head of the column, under Lieutenant-Colonel Novella, and forded the river. The firing then became general. The Moro fort had an American machine gun. which inflicted some losses upon the assailants, but after a fierce resistance to the Spanish charge, led by Colonel Arolas and Lieutenant-Colonel Novella, the fort was captured. The Moro loss was about 130 killed (of which about one-third were killed during the march): the Spanish lost 14 killed and 77 wounded. The Spanish casnalities included Lieutenant-Colonel Novella, wounded, while in the list of Moro killed were Naquid Pula, governor of Maibun. the Panglima Timbul, and four datos. At the close of the fight the fleet landed the Sultan Harun with 50 men, the town and the Chinese quarter were burned, and the fort destroyed. On the 17th the expedition returned to Jolo. On May 9 Arolas embarked 800 men on the fleet, disembarked at Parang, and marched upon the fort of Panglima Alimanaran, about 4 kilometers in the interior. Upon the approach of the troops the chief hoisted the Spanish flag and submitted to the Sultan Harun, who had accompanied the expedition. The Panglima Sayari, chief leader of Tapul Island, still remained hostile to Harun, and on May 23 Arolas and the Sultan, with about 800 men, sailed for Tapul. At 7 in the morning the expeditionary forces disembarked, together with 100 men from the fleet; the gunboats then opened fire on the fort and also shelled the surrounding hills. A captain was sent with two companies of the disciplinarios to occupy the settlement of the friendly Dato Buloan, but either by the ignorance or the treachery of the Moro guide he encountered a force of some 300 Moros in a well-defended position, who were commanded by the Panglima Sayari in person. Arolas hurried to the scene, and realizing the danger of defeat sent back for two more companies and four Plasencia guns. A heavy fire was opened upon the Moros, and their leader Sayari, with great coolness, appeared from time to time upon the parapet encouraging his men to resist to the utmost. The fight lasted for four hours and a half and was only terminated by a desperate attack from the entire Spanish force led by Arolas in person, the Moro defense being taken in hand-to-hand fighting, the Panglima Sayari falling dead in the midst of the struggle, together with several of his chiefs. The total Moro dead numbered over 90, the Spanish loss being 13 killed and 115 wounded. The expedition returned to Jolo the following day. As a result of these fights, many datos submitted to Harun, among them being Anislusin of Siassi and Janjari of Lati. Amilol Quiram and his mother had taken refuge at Talipao, while Aliubdin requested a conference. But the Panglima Sakilan, who governed the northwestern part of the island of Pata, situated south of Jolo, remained in a state of open hostility, and after an examination of the coasts of Pata in June, Arolas decided to lead an expedition to that island. For this purpose considerable reinforcements, especially the artillery and engineers, were sent to Jolo early in September, where the expedition was formed. It numbered some 1,500 men: the forces also had a battery of four Plasencia guns. The troops embarked on the gunboats on September 19, arriving off the \\" cota\\" of Sakilan on the morning of the 20th. The forces were disembarked and advanced against the fort, which was bombarded by the fleet and finally taken by assault between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon. On the following day another encounter took place, resulting in the flight of the Moros. The Spanish losses were 21 wounded. Colonel Arolas was made a brigadier-general, but continued in command at Jolo. On December 2, the Sultan Harun was obliged to return to Jolo from the island of Boal on account of the opposition of the inhabitants, and General Arolas found himself obliged to head a force of 700 of the Second Regiment and disciplinarios, which embarked at once with 5 gunboats. Arriving off Boal the troops disembarked and carried the Moro forts after a short action in which 5 men were wounded. The Moro loss was 45 killed, 32 of whom were at the fort and 13 juramentados who had attacked the first landing party. On the 4th the troops returned to Jolo. The beginning of 1888 witnessed several expeditions and combats, the first being against the Moros of Sariol. At dawn on February 19 two half brigades marched out of Jolo, the first under Lieutenant-Colonel Novella, the second under Capt. Victor Diaz, of the artillery. The headquarters and Sultan Harun also accompanied the forces. No opposition was encountered until the district of the Dato Yulcone was entered, but at that time a general fire was opened against the entire column. After some sharp fighting the Moros were driven off and the troops advanced. After a short interval the attack was renewed, an hour being consumed in gaining the plateau of Tambayang. After a short rest General Arolas decided to fall back to Jolo, and the column retired, harassed by the Moros until the territory of the friendly Dato Yau-Yali was reached. Jolo was reentered at '5 in the afternoon, the troops having suffered a loss of 2 killed and 18 wounded, 13 of the latter being disciplinarios. The Moro loss as reported was 7 killed and 16 wounded. Another expedition to Paticolo on February 24 resulted in the death of some 11 Moros and the wounding of 60. The Spanish forces lost 1 officer and 19 men wounded. 15 from the disciplinarios. On the 27th, four companies of artillery, a mountain section with two guns, a company of engineers, and 250 of the Fourth Regiment arrived at Jolo. On March 3 at daylight, an expedition nearly 2.000 strong left Jolo, under the command of General Arolas, for a march through the little-known district of Lati. On the afternoon of the same day the settlement of the Panglima Arosa was taken and destroyed, the Spanish having 7 wounded, the losses of the enemy being considerably greater. On the 11th another expedition, numbering 1,500 men, left Jolo on 7 war vessels in the harbor and disembarked at the point of Pandanan, in the eastern part of the island. A vigorous campaign was then begun, the Moros being defeated at Paticolo, Porrion, Piquidapo, and Piqnidajo on the 15th, 16th, 19th, 22d, 26th, and March 27, the dead Moros amounting to the number of 56. The Spanish losses were 7 killed and 84 wounded in the several fights. Notwithstanding the apparent supremacy of Sukan Harun, the Moros of Jolo persisted in their allegiance to Amilol Quiram, and the Spanish Government gave up the attempt to force Harun upon the people. Amilol Quiram was then recognized as the Sultan of Jolo. Campaigns against Mindanao Moros baptising a Moro convert to Roman Catholicism, circa 1890. On January 5, 1888, Lieutenant-General Weyler became captain-general in succession to General Terrero. Upon his arrival the military forces of the Philippines numbered 12,800 men, of whom 1,400 were Spaniards (of the artillery regiment) and the balance natives. The years 1888 and 1889 were without important military operations, and in the latter year the infantry regiments were renumbered. The new names and numbers, dating from October 31, 1889, were as follows: Sixty-eighth, Sixty-ninth, Seventieth, Seventy-first, Seventy-second, Seventythird, and Seventy-fourth. The disciplinary battalion was also retained. The fortified isthmus from Lintogup to Tucuran, begun by Terrero, was finished in 1890, the fort of Infanta Isabel being midway at Lubig. Posts were established at Parang-Parang, Tinancu, and Macar, the latter on the Bay of Sarangani. Relations with the Mindanao Moros, especially those of Lake Lanao, a region which had not been visited by Spanish forces since the days of Corcuera, two and a half centuries before, began to be strained through the establishment of those posts, and Weyler decided that operations were necessary against further aggressions. However, the outbreak in the Caroline Islands in June 1890, made an expedition to that distant part of the colony necessary and delayed operations in Mindanao until April 1891. On October 15, 1890, a band of Moros surprised the settlement of Monticao, near Iligan. killing 20 natives and carrying off 24. Other attacks of a minor nature also took place. On April 16, 1891, General Weyler sailed for Mindanao, and on the 20th arrived at Parang-Parang, where 4 companies of the Spanish artillery regiment, 3 companies of the Sixty-eighth, 3 companies of the Seventysecond regiment, a section of cavalry, and 2 mountain guns were assembled. Two expeditionary columns were organized under Lieutenant-Colonels Marina and Hernandez and took the field on the 23d and April 24, respectively. That of Marina, composed of the Spanish company and the three companies of the Sixty-eighth, marched from Parang upon the rancheria of Lipauan on the 23d, arriving at the place on the morning of the 24th, and discovered a fort garrisoned by 30 or 40 Moros. The place was attacked and captured, 1 Spaniard being severely wounded, and at 11 that night the return march for Parang was taken up, the latter place being reached in a sixteen-hour march of great difficulty. The column under Lieutenant-Colonel Hernandez, composed of one Spanish company and three companies of the Seventy-second Regiment, left Parang on the 24th against the rancheria of Buldung. The first day six rivers had to be crossed, the column bivouacking, the march being resumed the next morning. The camp that night was beside the Rio Sumased, the advance being resumed at dawn on the 26th. At half past 8 the column arrived before the cota of Buldung, which was defended by about 200 Moros. The column immediately attacked and took the fort with a loss of 2 killed, 3 severely wounded, and 5 slightly wounded, one of the latter being Lieutenant-Colonel Hernandez. Six dead Moros were seen and many were wounded. The following day the column returned to its base. On the 28th a force consisting of 6 companies left Parang for Baras, where a fort was constructed with a capacity of 200 men. Expeditions were also sent out through the country between Parang and Tucuran and to the lake called Lanao Chico by the Spaniards (now Dapao). The Lanao Moros. however, attacked the forces at Baras several times, in one of which attacks the Sultan of Bayat was wounded. On April 30 a column composed of 8 companies, commanded by Colonel Hore, of the artillery, left Baras for Maladi. where a body of Malanao Moros were reported to be fortified, and after a few hours' march the vanguard, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hernandez, discovered the Moros in a fort strongly protected. Upon seeing the Spanish force, many Moros attacked the column, but Hernandez advanced and took the fort after a hard fight. No less than 85 dead Moros. including the Sultan Benidel and 11 datos, were found within the fort, and 21 prisoners were taken. The Spanish loss was but 2 killed and 3 severely wounded. This fight is deemed to have been one of the most brilliant between the Spanish and Moros. But just at this time all operations were stopped by an epidemic of \\"la grippe,\\" which so affected the troops that on June 24 but 250 men were fit for duty, not one of whom was a Spaniard. At Parang 450 were sick; at Cotabato, 150; at Zamboanga, 600, and 190 at Isabela de Basilan. General 'Weyler occupied Malabang in July 1891, with eight companies and commenced the erection of Fort Corcuera, which occupied nearly the site of Corcuera's Sabanilla. A column under Captain Pintos was also sent toward Ganassi and took two cotas. The Moros attacked Malabang but were repulsed, and Weyler left for the Rio Grande, where the construction of three forts was ordered. Communication was also opened with Cagayan de Misamis. the mail being sent by the Pulangi (Rio Grande) River to Catitnan and then via land through Linabo to Cagayan. The politico-military government of Cotabato was also divided, that part of the river Nituan to Punta de Firchas being erected in the \\"Comandancia de la Bahia Illana.'' General Weyler then decided to attack the Lanao Moros from the north. To divert the attention of those living on the southern part of the lake, he ordered the commanding officer on Illana Bay to make a demonstration toward Ganassi about August 17, penetrating as far as possible into the enemy's territory. The troops for the main attack were organized into a \\"flying column\\" of 360 men, under Captain Pintos; the \\"first column\\" of 300 men, under Colonel Castilla, of the artillery; the \\"second column\\" of 522 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cortijo. The \\" first\\" and \\"flying \\" columns were landed at Linamon August 15, 1891, and marched up the left bank of the Agns River toward the lake, while the \\"second \\" colun n marched out of Iligan on the 16th, following the right bank of the Agus to the lake. Another force was landed at Galan to prevent the Moros of the rancheria of Manay from aiding those of Marantao, while a body of 160 men occupied Balud. The various columns returned on the 23d to their respective starting places, having severely punished the above-mentioned rancherias, killed their dates and the leader Amay Pac-Pac. together with many other Moros. and displayed the Spanish flag where it had not been seen for two hundred and fiftyone years. A fort was also erected near Momungan en route to Lake Lanao from Iligan, and another post was established on the river Liangan, near the point of Binuni, which was named Almonte, after the Spanish general of that name who fought the Moros more than a hundred years before. The Illana Bay column, which left on August 17, under Lieut. Col. Antonio Moras, for Ganassi, defeatad the Moros at Catalaluan, near the lake, killing 7.and then returning to Malabang with a loss of 1 wounded. As a consequence of this march many chiefs and datos. including the Sultan of Ganassi, presented themselves at Malabang and recognized the suzerainty of Spain. General Weyler was relieved as captain-general of the Philippines on November 17, 1891, being succeeded by Despujol, who. on a visit to Momungan, narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of a Moro dato (Dato Timbul Ali), who killed several soldiers when he discovered his inability to find the captain-general. On May 4, 1891, Lieut. Gen. Ramon Blanco became captain- general. He conducted the last considerable Moro campaign in Mindanao. Iligan was determined upon as the base of supplies, and Blanco arrived there in March 1894, by which time 3.000 troops had been assembled there. The troops worked upon the road from Iligan to Momungan, and 250 convicts sent from Bilibid prison, Manila, were added to the road force. On April 11a band of about 100 Moros made an attack upon the cattle guard at Malabang, consisting of 35 men, but were repulsed with a loss of 7 killed and several wounded. Upon hearing the firing other troops came out, accompanied by Capt. Manuel Prieto, the politico-military governor of the district, who was attacked by some of the wounded Moros whom he had ordered to be cared for, and wounded so badly that his left hand had to be amputated. General Blanco left Iligan for Momungan April 22. On the 23d the Moros attacked a detachment of woodcutters at Cabasaran, wounding 23, including Lieutenant Salgado of the Seventy-fourth. The Moros, however, were driven off, leaving 9 dead on the ground and many wounded. In May reinforcements of 350 arrived at Iligan. In May the Spanish advance lines were at Pantar, where General Parrado and Colonel Novella also had their headquarters, and Cabasaran was occupied. The greatest difficulty was experienced in the transportation of supplies, the carabao becoming useless through fatigue, and the trail being too rough for the supplies to be taken in baskets on poles. On May 8 a company of disciplinarios was attacked at Pagua, about 2 kilometers from Ulama, by some CO Moros, who wounded 2 men, 1 mortally. The Moros were repulsed with a loss of 8 killed and some 25 wounded. On May 15 General Blanco published a general order by which the field forces were organized into a brigade, under command of Brig. Gen. Julian Gonzales Parrado, the politico-military governor of Mindanao, divided into two demibrigades. as follows: First demibrigade, 11 companies, Col. Federico Novella, commanding; second demibrigade, 10 companies, Col. Enrique Hore, commanding; troops attached to general headquarters, about 750 men. On May 22 Moros near Momungan attacked a convoy guarded by 250 men and killed 4 and wounded 7 soldiers. They were driven off with a loss of 4 killed, one of whom was the Dato Sampiano, who had tried to kill Despujol on his visit to Iligan and Momungan (Now Baloi Lanao del Norte) about two years before. On June 2, while a convoy was being escorted to Camp Ulama from Momungan, 15 Moros attacked the convoy, killing 4 soldiers and wounding 2, but were driven off with loss of 8 or 10 killed. On the 3d Colonel Novella, with his demibrigade, made a reconnaissance. After much hard work in the jungle and crossing ravines, the height of Tomarmol was climbed about 10 a. m., the Moros offering slight resistance. In the afternoon Pimba and Panco were taken without difficulty, and the column returned to camp. The Spanish loss was 1 killed and 3 wounded, that of the Moros being estimated at 16 killed and many wounded. On June 5 Colonel Novella captured the cota of Dato Noral Kakin at Mut Pu, with a loss of 2 wouniled, the Moros retreating without much resistance. The column returned to camp. In June Blanco left Parrado in command of the operations in Mindanao, returning to Manila on the 19th. On June 9 a band of 500 Moros attacked the troops working on the road near Pantar; 41 Moros were killed and about 50 wounded. June 26 the sick in hospital at Iligan numbered 147, of whom 46 were Spaniards and 101 natives; malarial fever and dysentery prevailing among the former and ulcers and intestinal catarrh prevailing among the latter. On July 9, 400 Moros from various rancherias. commanded by Juarna Mamasa Balabagan, of Maguindanao, attacked a road-working force under Captain Salazar, who was killed, as were also several of his men. After a hard fight the Moros were repulsed with a loss of 26 killed, 14 mortally and 46 others were wounded, among the latter being 5 datos and a pandita (priest). On July 24 the advance arrived near the lake of Calanganan(Pantar Lanao del Norte), where more than 1,000 Moros under the Dato Amani Pac Pac and the sultans of Maciu, Ramain, and Tugaya had assembled. Here the Spaniards were attacked by more than 500 Moros, ambushed on each side of the road, and driven back in some confusion. A reenforcement of 200 arrived at this moment; an advance was ordered and the Moros were driven back, the Spanish loss being 2 killed and 9 wounded, while that of the Moros was reported as about 250 killed and 300 arms left on the field. In September the Sultan Rumani, the reputed ruler of 18 towns on the lake, visited the Spanish commander at Ulama, to indicate his desire for peace with Spain. In October the work of building the suspension bridge across the Agus was begun. About November 10 General Blanco returned to the scene of operations for a short time only. The Agus River bridge was finished and opened on February 27, 1895. The bridge consisted of a suspension span 40 meters long, with approaches of 21 meters and 12 meters, respectively, and was intended to bear the weight of railway trains. In February General Blanco again visited Iligan, and on March 10, at noon, the cota of Amani Pac Pac at Marahui was attacked by Spaniards. After a fight of four hours the fort was taken and the army gained the desired position on Lake Lanao; Generals Blanco, Parrado, and Aguirre were present and a cantonment was at once established. On May 9 some 40 Moros attacked Las Piedras, killing 2 and wounding 3 soldiers, but themselves losing 9 killed. On July 12 some 40 Moros from the rancherias of Tugaya and Putud, bearing a Spanish flag, approached a working party and attacked the soldiers, escaping with several rifles, after killing 2 soldiers and wounding 38. On August 18 the launch Lanao was launched at Marahui, the others being nearly finished. Many Moro dignitaries gave in their adhesion to Spain about this time, among them being the Rajah Muda of Ganassi, the Dato Pranga-Rungan of Tugayas, and the Dato Uregan of Maciu, said to have been the councilor-general of the Lake of Lanao. In October 1895, the Spanish forces were again reorganized, a division of two brigades being constituted. The division was commanded by Gen. Gonzales Parrado, the Northern Brigade by General de los Rios, and the Southern Brigade by General Luis Huertas. Divisional troops: Three companies engineers, mortar battery, cavalry squadron, and troops of the military administration. First (Northern) Brigade: About 10 companies of infantry. 2 companies disciplinarios, and 1 mountain batten'. Second (Southern) Brigade: About 10 companies of infantry, 2 companies diseiplinarios, 2 companies of engineers, 1 company of foot artillery, 1 mountain battery. The garrisons were as follows: Two companies of infantry and 1 company of engineers at Iligan; 1 company of infantry at Las Piedras; 2 companies of infantry at Camp Maria Cristina; 2companiesof infantry at Momungan: one-half company of infantry at Fort Tiradores; 3 companies of infantry at Camp Victoria. At Fort Briones, one-half company infantry; Fort Salazar, 1 company engineers, 1 company infantry; Fort Lumbayanegui, one-third company of infantry: Fort Nuevo, one-half company of Infantry; camp at Marahui. lOcompaniesof infantry, 1 mountain battery, 1 company engineers, mortar battery, naval battery, and cavalry squadron. WAR 1903‚ÄîVOL 3- 26 For escort purposes each branch of the service was to furnish an eighth of its force, except the cavalry, which was to furnish only a noncommissioned officer and 4 soldiers. Garrisons of forts mentioned above were exempted from furnishing escorts. Troops from Iligan were to convoy trains through to Marahui. Troops of the Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth to return to Sungut and Victoria the following morning and while resting were only to be employed in instruction and rifle practice. The cargadores (bearers) were not to be employed in any other labor whatever. From the report of General Blanco, dated Marahui, October 19, 1895, to the Spanish minister of war, the following is gleaned: Both horses and carabao are unsuitable for work on the road, the former on account of lack of strength and the latter on account of slowness and inability to work without very frequent water or mud baths. In consequence half of the army was compelled to work at keeping the road in repair. Material for 35 kilometers of the railway was at Iligan, which was enough to complete the same to the suspension bridge of Alphonso XIII over the Agus. The railway route would have to deviate from the road slightly to the west in the first 10 or 12 kilometers from Iligan in order to ascend the passes of Tominubo and Nonucan, Fort Maria Cristina being 450 meters above the sea at the head of the Nonucan. From Maria Cristina to the bridge the railway could follow the wagon road. From Iligan to Fort de las Piedras was 11 kilometers: from the latter fort to the river Nonucan was 2 kilometers. The bridge over this river is commanded by Fort Maria Cristina, which also covers several trails leading to important Moro rancherias. From the river Nonucan to the fort at Momungan on Agus River, which is of considerable width at this point, was 4 kilometers. From Momungan to Fort Tiradores at Banar 3 kilometers. This fort commanded the approaches to some rancherias, and also the ascent to the cota of Bulut on the same hill, while 4 kilometers distant was the lake of Calaganan, near which were Fort Victoria and Fort Salgado, the latter near the wood of Balete. To this succeeds the plateau of Ulama, dominated by Fort Briones, which is in sight of Fort Salazar, 2 kilometers distant. This latter fort, situated 40 meters above the bridge of Alphonso XIII across the Agus, together with the Fort of Sungut, on the opposite bank, commanded the crossing and also guarded Linanan. For 5 kilometers beyond Sungut the country was rolling, open, and cultivated, and protected by the small fort of Lumbayanaqui, which also guarded the nearby wood of Vito. Here the road ascended a precipitous hill to the extensive and elevated plateau in which Lake Lanao is situated at a level of about 800 meters above the sea. At the summit of the hill was Fort Nuevo, 2 kilometers from Marahui, the station on the lake. Marahui was also flanked by the redoubts of Aranda and Allanegui, which defended the landing place. On February 17, 1896, about a thousand reinforcements arrived at Iligan from Manila. General Blanco and General Aguirrealso visited Iligan on March 6. The road was found in bad condition on account of eight days'rain. On March 12 the captain-general arrived at Marahui. The water supply from Lake Lanao was found to be as satisfactory as that from a spring at Fort Nuevo. Two Moros seized the rifles of 2 native soldiers, and on the night of the 12th Fort Nuevo, garrisoned by 50 men, was attacked by the Moros, who were repulsed with a loss of several killed. The maximum temperature of Marahui is stated to have been 27 ¬∞C., and minimum 12 ¬∞C. (April and May). On February 25 Fort Reina Regente, on the hills of Tinuncup, in the Rio Grande Valley, 18 meters about the sea, was garrisoned. The commanding officer, Col. Ricarto Perez, is said to have been asked by Dato Uto if 10,000 men could take the fort, to which the Spanish officer replied that all the Moros in Mindanao could not take it. At this time the most advanced post of the Spaniards was Fort Picit, 34 miles above Reina Regente, but another at Catituan, 8 leagues beyond Picit, was contemplated. On March 20 a company of disciplinarios under Capt. Felipe Garde was attacked by a number of Moros while clearing ground near the new fort of Corcnera at Malabang, losing 5 rifles and having 7 men wounded. Later these Moros were surprised at Baqui, near old Fort Corcuera, 18 being killed and 12 wounded. On March 30 a detachment of Spanish troops, together with 180 Moro allies, left Corcuera for the source of the river Mataling in search of a hostile force from the rancherias of Pualas, Bacolod, Gadungan, Boras, and Dinaposas, but without result. In the latter part of March the gunboat Panay shelled some Moros at the mouth of the river Macklin. On April 1 General Blanco left Marahni for Iligan, where he embarked for Zamboanga and the Rio Grande region. At this time the military organizations in Mindanao were as follows: The division of Mindanao, with headquarters at Zamboanga; First Brigade, Gen. F. Castilla. comprising second, third, and seventh districts, headquarters Iligan or Marahni; Second Brigade, headquarters ParangParang, Col. C. Lasala, comprising first, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. Colonel Hereidla, count of Terra Alta, was politico-military governor of Lanao, the actual command, however, being under Colonel del Real. Gen. Luis Huerta was politico-military governor of Jolo and Gen. Diego de losRios was politico-military governor of Eoilo. On April 12 General Blanco arrived in Illana Bay and inspected the new fort of Malabang on the 13th. During his visit some Moros attacked the place, but were repulsed, leaving 22 dead on the field. On the following day a Spanish force on a scout was attacked, General Aguirre and Lieutenant-Colonel Soro being wounded. General Aguirre returned to Manila on May 10, and General Blanco also returned after visiting the forts of Polloc and Cotabato. In April 1896, some piratical vessels robbed a boat on the coast of Occidental Negros, but pursuit of them was not effective. On April 29 the garrison of Marahui consisted of 1,700 men, with 40 sick. Near Baras, 6 miles west of Malabang, 40 men, under a captain, away from the fort, were attacked by Moros, but after a sharp fight the latter were repulsed with a loss of 5 datos and 11 others killed. The Spaniards had 1 soldier mortally and 3 severely wounded. On July 1.1896, the city of Manila presented a sword of honor to General Blanco as a memorial of his campaign in Mindanao. On July 9 a juramentado\\" killed a soldier at Cotabato and was himself killed by soldiers of the garrison. On August 7 the Sultan of Tugaya presented himself at Marahui with a request for peace. On August 9 a Moro attacked and wounded a lieutenant in the Lanao country, but was killed by the latter. The outbreak of the Tagalog insurrection in August 1896. evidently influenced the disciplinarios, of whom some 300 belonging to the Third and Fourth companies deserted late in September from the Lanao country, making for Misamis Province. They were pursued and defeated near Opol and Agusan in Misamis. A sergeant killed Lieut. Bueno Espanosa at Lintogup on September 16. He was afterwards shot at Iligan. On November 12, 80 Moros from a rancheria near Taraca attacked a convoy escorted by some marine infantry near Aparicolo, killing 1 soldier and wounding 3. The Moros were driven off with a loss of 3 killed and 23 wounded. On November 19 the lake gunboats General Blanco, Coreuera, and Almonte, near Bayan, were fired upon by the Moros. After returning the fire the vessels returned to Marahui. where two companies and some marines embarked for Bayan, which was bombarded and a loss of 100 killed inflicted upon the Moros. Later the cota of Bacolod was bombarded and destroyed, and 3 deserters from the disciplinarios were shot at Marahui. In December a so-called insurgent governor was captured and shot at Misamis. On December 24 a force of deserters was defeated near Cagayan Misamis, and the leader, a former Corporal Bravo, was killed. On the same day Major San Martin, with 60 soldiers, attacked and defeated another band of deserters who were in possession of the Church at Milagros Viejo (Butuan Valley), killing 4 and wounding many, while 2 soldiers (natives‚ÄîTagalogs) were executed at Iligan on the 29th for complicity in the uprising; and during January 2 corporals and 5 soldiers were shot at Tucuran and Cotabato for the same crime. On April 11, 1897, a plot was discovered at Jolo implicating many of the deported Tagalog insurgents and some of the men of the Sixty-eighth Regiment, the plan being to overthrow the Spanish rule at Jolo. As a result of the plot 13 former insurgents were sentenced to death, together with 3 corporals of the Sixth-eighth Regiment. General Polavieja was relieved on April 23, 1897, by General Primo de Rivera as captain-general of the Philippines. On May 15, 8 juramentados from the rancheria of Boal, Jolo, went to Bus-Bus, a suburb of Jolo, and attacked some soldiers of the Sixty- eighth Regiment, who were landing in a small boat. The soldiers fired on them, killing 6 of the number in the water and 2 on shore. During the spring of 1897 expeditions were made by the lake gunboats from Marahui against the cotas of Bayan, Binadayan, and Bacolod. Later operations were carried on against the rancherias of Sugut, Molundum, and Lipo. On May 15 two companies and the lake launches attacked the settlements of Uato and Malaig, near Marahui. In July 1897, Fort Corcuera, built by the military engineer, Galvez, was garrisoned by one company of infantry, and Fort Baras by one company. There was also one company guarding the isthmus, with posts at Tucuran, Lnbig, and Lintogup; headquarters at Parang. The posts on Illana Bay were visited about every ten days by the gunboats Panay and Mariveles, which had their headquarters at Polloc. In July other deserters from the disciplinarios were being pursued by troops from Iligan. On August 7, 1897, the third squadron of Thirty-first Cavalry left Manila for Iligan to relieve the cavalry serving in that district. In July. 1897, the forts on the Rio Grande de Mindanao were Cotabato, Reina Regente, Picit, Kudarangan, Taviran, Tamontat a, and Labungan. The gunboats Gardoqui and Urdaneta were also in the vicinity. In October 1897, Moros attacked the Spanish fort near Las Piedras, wounding 2 soldiers. One Moro was killed, and later the rancheria of the assailants was destroyed and 3 Moros killed. On November 13 nearly all the buildings at Marahui were destroyed by fire, which the prevalence of a strong wind facilitated. Almost at the same time Iligan was inundated by the rivers at that place and much damage done. On December 15 a small force from Iligan, in pursuit of some escaped deported natives of Luzon, was attacked by Moros. Four Moros and 4 of the deported natives were killed in the fight, the Spaniards also losing 1 man killed. On February 4.1898, General Buil directed 4 columns under Lieutenant- Colonels Brandeis, Iturriaga, Torres-Ascarza. and Ruiz Toledo from Marahui, which, together with the 3 gunboats on Lake Lanao, destroyed the rancherias of Bonto, Buayan, Ragayan, Minbalay, and Macro.. The Moro losses were 32 killed, 80 wounded, and 25 prisoners; Spanish losses not given. General Primo de Rivera was succeeded in April by General Agustin; and the destruction of the fleet, on May 1, cut off the Southern Islands from Manila until the middle of August, at which time General Jaudenes represented the Spanish power at Manila and General delos Rios at Iloilo. In December General de los Rios evacuated Iloilo. the Spanish troops being concentrated at Zamboanga from all parts of Mindanao under the command of General Montero. The last Spanish politico- military governor of Iligan was probably Capt. Ricardo Carnicero Sanchez, who was appointed to that position on November 1, 1898. Note By Translator.‚ÄîThe four Spanish gunboats were scuttled in the deeper part of Lake Lanao. The post of Marahui was abandoned, and the Moros assert that the bridge over the Agus River was destroyed by the Spanish troops.

A trade involving the Moros selling slaves and other goods in exchange for guns developed. The Chinese had infiltrated the economy of the sultante, taking control of the Sultanate's economies in Mindanao and dominating the markets. Though the Sultans did not like the fact that the Chinese had a monopoly over the economy, they did business with them. The Chinese set up a trading network between Singapore, Zamboanga, Jolo and Sulu. The Chinese sold small arms like Enfield and Spencer Rifles to the Buayan Datu Uto. They were used to battle the Spanish invasion of Buayan. The Datu paid for the weapons in slaves. The population of Chinese in Mindanao in the 1880s was 1,000. The Chinese ran guns across a Spanish blockade to sell to Mindanao Moros. The purchases of these weapons were paid for by the Moros in slaves in addition to other goods. The main group of people selling guns were the Chinese in Sulu. The Chinese took control of the economy and used steamers to ship goods for exporting and importing. Opium, ivory, textiles, and crockery were among the other goods which the Chinese sold. The Chinese on Maimbung sent the weapons to the Sulu Sultanate, who used them to battle the Spanish and resist their attacks. A Chinese-Mestizo was one of the Sultan's brothers-in-law, the Sultan was married to his sister. He and the Sultan both owned shares in the ship (named the Far East) which helped smuggled the weapons. The Spanish launched a surprise offensive under Colonel Juan Arolas in April 1887 by attacking the Sultanate's capital at Maimbung in an effort to crush resistance. Weapons were captured and the property of the Chinese were destroyed while the Chinese were deported to Jolo. Resistance The Moros maintained their independence from the Spanish, battling them constantly, it took until the final 2 decades of the presence of the Spanish in the Philippines for them to launch an extensive conquest of Mindanao. Kris were used by the Moros. The Moros tortured shrieking Spanish troops.

Taxonomic history The name was originally established by Miles Berkeley in 1849 as Polyporus curtisii, and later transferred to the genus Ganoderma by William Alphonso Murrill in 1908. This species is tentative and is a subject of debate as to its viability as a distinct species from North American specimens described as G. lucidum (G. sessile), which is much more widely distributed throughout the US. There is also debate about the identities of several species that resemble G. lucidum and G. tsugae. One reason for an alleged synonymy between G. sessile and G. curtisii is overlap in habitat, decaying hardwoods. According to Volk, Gilbertson and Ryvarden, authors of North American Polypores, it is not considered a separate species from G. lucidum. Bessette et al., authors of Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States, echo this and list it as a synonym to G. lucidum. Paul Stamets considers G. lucidum and G. curtisii to both be members of a tight-knit species complex. However, several recent molecular studies have shown Ganoderma curtisii to be genetically distinct from Ganoderma lucidum, calling into doubt the synonymy of the two species and supporting previous mycologists' opinion that it is a distinct species. The same studies support the idea that G. lucidum sensu stricto is actually absent from the North American continent and that the mushroom widely called G.lucidum in North America is instead G.sessile, a member of the Ganoderma resinaceum complex, with Ganoderma curtisii as a separate species. Description This polypore bears a marked resemblance to G. lucidum and generally has a stipe, sometimes lacking the characteristic red to purple varnished appearance that G. lucidum possesses.

The victims, Roman Catholic Senator Paddy Wilson and his Protestant friend Irene Andrews, were hacked and repeatedly stabbed to death by members of the \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF). This was a cover name for the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a then-legal Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation. John White, the UFF's commander, who used the pseudonym \\"Captain Black\\", was convicted of the sectarian double murder in 1978 and sentenced to life imprisonment. White, however maintained that the UFF's second-in-command Davy Payne helped him lead the assassination squad and played a major part in the attack. Although questioned by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) after the killings, Payne admitted nothing and was never charged. Wilson was one of the founders and General Secretary of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Irene Andrews was noted in Belfast as a popular ballroom dancer. Their mutilated bodies were found lying in pools of blood on either side of Wilson's car, which was parked in a quarry off the Hightown Road near Cavehill. Wilson had been hacked and stabbed 30 times and his throat cut from ear to ear. Andrews had received 20 knife wounds. The killings were described by the judge at White's trial as \\"a frenzied attack, a psychotic outburst\\". The double killings On the evening of 25 June 1973, Stormont Senator Paddy Wilson (39), a Roman Catholic native of Belfast's Sailortown, and General Secretary and founder of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), had been drinking at the Old Vic Lounge inside McGlade's Bar, a fashionable pub located in Donegall Street, Belfast city centre.Note: McGlade's Bar is now \\"The Kremlin\\". He was in the company of a Protestant friend, Irene Andrews (29), who worked as a clerk in the Department of Education and was one of Belfast's most popular ballroom dancers who had been a member of Northern Ireland's \\"Come Dancing\\" team.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.118\\"Killings Bring Wave of Shock to North\\". Irish Times. Renagh Holoran. 27 June 1973 Retrieved 23 December 2011 According to Peter McKenna, a journalist for the Irish Independent who had been socialising with Wilson, Andrews and others on the night, an inebriated Andrews had spent much of the night making passes at Wilson but he had rejected her advances and had asked for McKenna to make an \\"urgent\\" phone call to the pub calling him away in an attempt to separate himself from Andrews. The ruse was not successful, however, and Wilson and Andrews left the pub together.Dillon, Martin (2003). The Trigger Men. Mainstream Publishing. p. 242 He offered her a lift back to her home on the Crumlin Road and they drove away from the pub at about 11:30 in Wilson's red mini. The couple never arrived at their destination. At 1:30, the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), using their codename \\"Captain Black\\", called the Belfast News Letter advising them that, \\" tonight we have got Senator Paddy Wilson and a lady friend. Their bodies are lying in the Hightown Road.\\" The UFF had been founded that same year by John White, who employed the pseudonym \\"Captain Black\\". The UFF was a cover name to claim attacks carried out by the then-legal Ulster Defence Association to avoid the latter's proscription by the British Government. \\"Captain Black\\" furthermore claimed that the killings were in retaliation for the shooting death of a mentally- disabled Protestant teenager the previous summer by the Provisional IRA. The mutilated bodies of Wilson and Andrews were discovered by the security forces at 4. They were lying in pools of blood on either side of Wilson's Mini at a quarry off the Hightown Road near Cavehill as described by the UFF caller. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army had proceeded carefully to the quarry in case the bodies had been booby-trapped. Wilson had been stabbed to death 30 times and his throat sliced from ear-to-ear. There was evidence that he had put up a struggle before he was killed. Andrews had received 20 knife wounds. A UFF Brigade Staff member described the killings to a journalist as ritualistic;Wood, p.22 in addition to the multiple stabbings, Irene Andrews also had her breasts hacked off.Vance, David (2008). Unionism Decayed: 1997-2007. Milton Keynes, England: Author House UK Ltd. p.93 The killings took place at the quarry and it was suggested by police that Wilson's Mini had been stopped on the road leading to Ballysillan and they were forced at gunpoint to drive out to the quarry. According to Martin Dillon forensic evidence indicated that Wilson had been dragged from the car and pinned to the ground where he was stabbed and Andrews was killed afterwards. Dillon speculated that the killers had made Andrews watch Wilson being killed. There was widespread shock and condemnation in the wake of the killings. Politicians, including Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and SDLP leader Gerry Fitt, offered their condolences to the Wilson and Andrews' families, whilst Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley blamed the IRA. According to Peter Taylor, there had never been a crime so brutal carried out in Northern Ireland before. Author Dervla Murphy in her travel book, A Place Apart (based on her experiences in Northern Ireland), stated that nine months before the double killing, a loyalist community newspaper had published allegations regarding a possible relationship between a prominent member of the SDLP and a young Protestant woman from Belfast's Crumlin Road.Murphy, Dervla (1978). A Place Apart. UK: Penguin Books. pp.144-145 Conviction UFF leader and self-styled \\"Captain Black\\" John White confessed to the killings during a police interrogation for other offences at the Castlereagh Holding Centre in 1976. He was convicted of the murders in 1978 and given two life sentences. The trial judge described the killings as \\"a frenzied attack, a psychotic outburst\\".\\"Anniversary of Brutal Murder\\". Ireland Click. 19 June 2003 White maintained that the UFF's second-in-command (and later North Belfast UDA brigadier) Davy Payne, also known as \\"The Psychopath\\", was part of the assassination squad and played a leading role in the killings. Historian Ian S. Wood confirmed Payne's central involvement in the double killing.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: a History of the UDA. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p. 105 Although Payne had been questioned by the RUC after the killings, he admitted nothing and never faced any charges. It was alleged that whenever Payne wished to frighten or intimidate others he would shout: \\"Do you know who I am? I'm Davy Payne. They say I killed Paddy Wilson\\".Jack Holland. \\"Davy Payne, aka, 'the Psychopath' dies\\". Irish Echo. 26 March-1 April 2003. Following White's release from the Maze Prison in 1992, he joined the Ulster Democratic Party. A prominent figure in the Northern Ireland Peace Process, in 1996 he comprised part of a four-man loyalist delegation to 10 Downing Street where he met British Prime Minister John Major. Later when asked why he had perpetrated the killings, White claimed that they were carried out to strike fear into the Catholic community after the IRA's 1973 Coleraine bombings. Regarding Irene Andrews, White replied, \\"We didn't know she was a Protestant, we just thought she was a Catholic to be honest\\".Barry McCaffrey. \\"Rise and fall of loyalist icons\\", Irish News. 7 February 2003.

Its distribution is more patchy in the west but it is widespread in eastern Canada.Eriophorum viridicarinatum. The Nature Conservancy. This perennial sedge forms tufts of stiff, erect stems, sometimes just a single stem, and basal leaves up to 30 centimeters long. It grows from a rhizome. The inflorescence is accompanied by two to four leaflike bracts each a few centimeters long. There are up to 30 spikelets, increasing in size as the fruit develops, reaching 3 centimeters in length. Each flower has a tuft of white or brown bristles that are long and cottony, measuring up to 2.5 centimeters long.Eriophorum viridicarinatum. Flora of North America. This plant grows at high latitudes and high elevations, in cold, wet habitat types such as sphagnum bogs and tundra overlying permafrost.

It helped to popularize the free newspaper as a business model at the beginning of the 21st century, and also rescued the San Francisco Examiner from being shut down by the Hearst Corporation. The publication was founded in 1958 as a neighborhood newspaper called the Lake Merced Independent. Marsha Fontes, a local historian, took the reins in 1979. She sold it to Ted Fang and the Fang family in 1987. As editor and publisher, Fang almost immediately began growing the Independent, expanding from a tabloid format into a standard broadsheet size newspaper and extending distribution citywide in 1988. In 1993, Fang purchased a chain of weeklies in San Mateo County owned by the Chicago Tribune and in 1998 all the publications were re- branded as The Independent. In 2000, the Fang family purchased the SF Examiner and the Fangs became the first Asian American family to run a major daily newspaper in America. The Independent covered neighborhood stories and issues that affected the development of San Francisco during this period, and each issue had twelve different editorial editions tailored to the city‚Äôs and the peninsula's different neighborhoods. Among the issues championed by the Independent included saving Laguna Honda Hospital and re-building it into one of the largest skilled nursing facilities in the country. The Independent‚Äôs editorial positions also helped set the direction for San Francisco‚Äôs future into the 21st century, helping to elect the first police chief to serve as SF Mayor, the first African American to serve as SF Mayor, and the most progressive district attorney in all of America for San Francisco. The Independent was a key player in the last chapter of San Francisco‚Äôs newspaper wars during the 1990s. The Independent twice sued both of SF‚Äôs daily newspapers, the SF Examiner and SF Chronicle, over monopolistic business practices. And all three newspapers frequently wrote about each other in sometimes disparaging terms. As of 2000, The Independent was distributed three times. As of March, 2001, the Independent had ceased delivering to homes on Saturdays, being distributed only at newsstands and as an insert into the San Francisco Examiner. The newspaper has since stopped publication. Growth of The Independent When Marsha Fontes sold the San Francisco Independent in 1987, she generated $5,000 per week in advertising revenue. Ted Fang was running his family‚Äôs printing business where the Independent was being printed, and negotiated a deal to purchase the tabloid from Fontes. It was the first time Fang would take on the title of Editor and Publisher. Later media coverage popularized the story of the Independent being given to Fang as a birthday present from his parents John and Florence Fang. Ironically when Fang took over the San Francisco Examiner thirteen years later, this story came to mirror William Randolph Hearst‚Äôs story of receiving the SF Examiner newspaper as a gift from his father exactly a century earlier in 1887. Ted Fang Under new ownership, the Independent quickly took a more aggressive approach to growth and that summer launched a challenge to the largest and oldest community paper, the San Francisco Progress, by submitting a bid to publish the public notices for the city and becoming the Official Newspaper of San Francisco. Although the Independent was ultimately not successful in securing that advertising contract, the next year the scrappy newspaper was successful in pulling the bulk of the real estate community‚Äôs advertising away from the Progress and into a new publication printed by the Independent. Then, on December 15, 1988 the San Francisco Progress shut its doors, ceased publication and filed for bankruptcy. In six days, on December 21, 1988, the Independent converted from a tabloid size to the traditional broadsheet newspaper size and increased circulation from 80,000 to 180,000. Over the next ten years, the Independent continued its growth pace, beginning three times a week publication in 1990, and then purchasing a chain of weeklies owned by the Chicago tribune in 1993. The six mastheads included Burlingame Hillsborough Boutique & Villager, San Carlos Belmont Enquirer-Bulletin, Foster City Progress, Redwood City Tribune, San Mateo Weekly and Millbrae Sun. Later The Independent also acquired the Redwood City Almanac. By 1997, the weeklies began publishing twice weekly and in 1998, the Independent Newspaper Group officially became America‚Äôs largest non-daily newspaper, when its eight Bay Area mastheads all changed their names to The Independent. The following August, the Hearst Corporation, owners of the San Francisco Examiner and the largest private publishers in the world, announced their purchase of the morning daily San Francisco Chronicle. They also claimed the San Francisco Examiner was not a viable business operation and planned to shut it down. The Independent led an effort to keep the Examiner open, and ultimately the U.S. Department of Justice under Attorney General Janet Reno forced the Hearst‚Äôs to sell the SF Examiner to the Fang family in 2000.Carlsen, William; Holding, Reynolds. (April 27, 2000). How Politics Tangled Up S.F. Newspaper Deals. San Francisco Chronicle. Hearst Publications. Retrieved December 23, 2011. Editorial Focus of The Independent The Independent started as a neighborhood newspaper, carrying advertisements from neighborhood businesses and covering local news for neighborhood residents. Fang continued this ‚Äúpro- neighborhood stance inspired by grass roots reporting‚Äù even as the paper grew to cover all of San Francisco and the San Francisco peninsula. The Independent achieved this through the use of targeting editorial content in 12 different zones over its total circulation of 379,000 copies covering from San Francisco through Redwood City. Agnos years cover The Independent was an avid protector of the free press and a fighter for more open government. One of the Independent‚Äôs first major actions under Fang was to file suit against the City and County of San Francisco to open up closed-door meetings being held by then Mayor Art Agnos and some of the city supervisors. Fang and The Independent were also a co-founder of the California Free Press Association to advocate for the needs of free newspaper publishers. City Services book published by SF Independent Generally representing a non-establishment viewpoint, The Independent‚Äôs editorial coverage became more ambitious and strident as the newspaper grew. In the 1990s for example, The Independent began an ‚Äúaggressive public awareness and voter education campaign with the goal of raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build a new state-of-the-art facility\\" for Laguna Honda Hospital. With political consultant Jack Davis, Independent columnist Warren Hinckle, healthcare union leader Sal Roselli and Public Health Department Director Dr. Mitchell Katz, among others, the ‚ÄúLaguna Honda First‚Äù campaign resulted in a $400 million rebuild of the institution as the only publicly funded long-term care facility of its kind in the U.S. The Independent also became a leading voice in citywide elections. In 1991, The Independent published its first book, The Agnos Years, a collection of Warren Hinckle‚Äôs columns critical of then Mayor Art Agnos. Up to that point, the SF Examiner ‚Äì and its publisher William Randolph Hearst III ‚Äì had been the leading editorial voice in San Francisco politics. That year, Hearst fired Hinckle and endorsed Agnos‚Äô re-election during the runoff. When Agnos was unseated by political newcomer and former police chief Frank Jordan, backed by The Independent, it also intensified the newspaper feud into open editorial warfare. The following year, Hearst retired as publisher to become a venture capitalist. The Independent backed the election of Mayor Willie Brown in 1995 and partnered with Brown‚Äôs administration on a number of neighborhood and diversity initiatives for San Francisco. The Independent also supported the crime prevention policies of then Supervisor Terence Hallinan in his successful campaign to become San Francisco District Attorney. Fang served as co-chair of District Attorney Hallinan‚Äôs transition committee. Newspaper Wars As the first prominent Asian American publishers in the news industry, and as the first neighborhood publication to aggressively challenge San Francisco‚Äôs entrenched establishment and longstanding major newspapers, the Fangs and The Independent were alternately scrutinized and underestimated. Bud Liebes, l0-year chair of San Francisco State University‚Äôs journalism department scoffed at the Independent‚Äôs plan to expand citywide distribution, telling the SF Examiner that the Independent‚Äôs presses were the most antiquated he had ever seen. Liebes was a former Examiner reporter with deep contacts at both dailies. In 1992, the newspaper industry magazine Editor and Publisher characterized The Independent and SF Examiner relationship as ‚ÄúNewspapers feuding in San Francisco‚Äù. In fact, The Independent first sued the SF Examiner and SF Chronicle publishers in 1989, accusing the two dailies of using predatory business practices and below cost pricing to undercut The Independent‚Äôs citywide expansion. During a brief d√©tente after John Fang (Ted‚Äôs father) passed suddenly in 1992 the lawsuit was settled between both parties. But it was quickly revived in 1993. The Independent won a jury trial with punitive damages, but the verdict was overtuned on appeal in 2000. Meanwhile, the editorial attacks continued to appear prominently in news pages for all San Franciscans to read. The SF Examiner assigned three reporters to investigate James Fang, Ted‚Äôs brother, who had been appointed as San Francisco‚Äôs Director of Commerce and Trade by new Mayor Frank Jordan. The three investigative reporters published five front page stories in a week, accusing James of ‚Äúpumping up‚Äù his resume. The Independent was also known for its animosity toward the Examiner and began running a weekly comic strip called \\"Mr. Sharon Stone,\\" a dig at Phil Bronstein, who was executive editor of the Examiner and married to actress Sharon Stone. Independent columnist Warren Hinckle, who had formerly worked at the Examiner, described The Independent's coverage of his former newspaper \\"a holy crusade\\".San Francisco Chronicle: Examiner Sold / S.F.

The Independent ran front page pictures of San Franciscans like Andre Siordia, an employee of Casa Sanchez restaurant hanging up signs to ‚ÄúStop the Phoney Sale ‚Äì Keep San Francisco a 2 newspaper town. In turn, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Carolyn Said conducted an informal poll of people in San Francisco's Financial District and revealed complete dismissal of the Independent. Said Brian Antonio, a clerk at the Pacific Stock Exchange of The Independent: \\"Oh, that's the one nobody reads. That's the one that goes right in the recycling bin.\\"Said, Carolyn; Curiel, Jonathan. (March 18, 2000).

Pioneering Newspaper Family The Independent developed the free-newspaper business model to a new level, with all revenue generated from advertising sources and no paid subscription revenue. The Independent also did not sell copies through newsracks.Raine, George. (December 25, 1998.) News Rack Attack. San Francisco Chronicle. Hearst Publications. Retrieved December 23, 2011. This mirrored the emerging model of internet news during those times, where news information is available free to consumers and not just available to those who could afford to pay for a newspaper. In 1994, The Independent waged a campaign to have San Francisco place its public notices in free newspapers to make them more accessible to the public. This resulted in San Francisco‚Äôs legal notice advertising moving out of the SF Examiner and SF Chronicle, and into the SF Independent and newspapers targeting minority populations. The Independent received a significant source of revenue from legal notices, which brought in an estimated $917,670 in 2000.Fost, Dan. (March 1, 2001). Examiner Struggles to Find Its Voice. San Francisco Chronicle. Hearst Publications. Retrieved December 23, 2011. The added effect of the free newspaper model was to develop targeted advertising down to the zip code and even sub-zip code level. This was a revolutionary approach to newspapers which had in the past only published advertising throughout the paper‚Äôs circulation network no matter how distant from the advertiser‚Äôs location. It also foreshadowed the micro- targeting now available in digital marketing campaigns. The Fang‚Äôs were the first Asian American family to build a newspaper chain and ultimately own a major U.S. daily newspaper. They were also one of the first Asian American families to gain prominence in a major American city, and also at the state and national level. Ted‚Äôs father John Fang was a newspaper pioneer in his own right, serving as Editor and Publisher of the Young China Daily News which was started by modern China‚Äôs founding father Sun Yat Sen. In 1979, John also started AsianWeek, the national English language newspaper known as the ‚ÄúVoice for Asian America.‚Äù The Fangs and The Independent were proponents of diversity in their own businesses and in society at large. They supported Willie Brown as the first African American to serve as mayor of San Francisco and encouraged diversity among department heads including the first gay man to run the SF Department of Public Works and the first African American to serve as Fire Chief. The San Francisco Police Department also made great strides, with its first Asian American police chief, first African American police chief and first female police chief during this period. Purchase of San Francisco Examiner The Fang family heavily protested the proposed purchase by Hearst, owner of the San Francisco Examiner, of the San Francisco Chronicle, saying it would hurt the Independent.Rosenfeld, Seth. (May 16, 2000.) Fang's backstage moves for Examiner. San Francisco Examiner. Retrieved December 23, 2011. Eventually, the Examiner was sold to The Independent by Hearst to avoid anti-trust litigation. Critics, like former campaign manager and failed mayoral candidate Clint Reilly made wild accusations against The Independent and Fang, falsely claiming that Fang would make a salary of $500,000 per year, four times his salary at The Independent. In addition, under the terms of the deal, Reilly and his hired lawyers alleged that the Fang family could pocket half of every dollar over $15 million of the $25 million subsidy they received from Hearst. All of the critics charges proved false and Fang's purchase of the Examiner was approved in federal court. Political bias The Independent was widely considered to reflect the political biases of the Fang family.(need source) In 1991 'Independent columnist Warren Hinckle wrote a booklet attacking then-mayor Art Agnos, which was published and distributed by the Fang family's printing company.Simon, Mark.

The Fang family was active in fundraising for Willie Brown and Terence Hallinan and the family's printing company printed campaign literature for Hallinan. Ted Fang was named to Hallinan's transitional team after he was elected, and James Fang was named to Brown's. More criticism centered around city loans given to Pan Asia Venture Capital Corp., owned by the Fang family. The company was given a $650,000 loan from the Mayor's Office of Community Development, which came with stipulations against political use. However, in 1999, the Coalition of San Francisco Neighborhoods and Harvey Milk Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Club both passed resolutions calling on the Independent to cease advocating for Brown and Hallinan and criticizing their opponents.Coile, Zachary.

The newspaper was also criticized by Chronicle columnists in 1996 for taking sides in a San Mateo County Board of Supervisors race, working to defeat incumbent Mary Griffin. Ted Fang denied the accusations that he was slanting his newspaper's coverage against Griffin, and said, \\"I've expressed my personal opinion. That has nothing to do with editorial coverage.\\" Adding, regarding Griffin's refusal to be interviewed by editorial board of the Independent: \\"Anytime a politician becomes so powerful they can choose which newspaper they want to talk to, or don't want to talk to, I think that's when the citizens of the county should be afraid.\\" Ted Fang has defended his newspaper's actions, saying, \\"We fight for what we believe in.\\" San Francisco Chronicle managing editor Daniel E.

The song continues to be a hit at most sporting events of the school, but specifically at events between the California Golden Bears and their rival, the Stanford Cardinal. Given the relative age and similarities between the songs as well as the unlikelihood of Montana and Georgia Tech crossing paths, it is likely that both \\"Up With Montana\\" and \\"White and Gold\\" are derived from \\"The Stanford Jonah.\\" The Stanford Jonah (1913) :So then it's up with the Blue and Gold, :Down with the Red; red, red, red :California's out for a victory, :We'll drop our battle axe on Stanford's head; chop :When we meet her, our team will surely beat her. :Down on the Stanford farm, there'll be no sound, :When our Oski rips through the air. :Like our friend Mister Jonah, Stanford's team will be found, :In the tummy of the Golden Bear.

Both versions of the song retain the oft-discussed \\"and the squeal of the pig will float on the air from the tummy of the Grizzly bear.‚Äù Some interpret the \\"pig\\" floating on the air as referring to a football (i.e. pigskin) being thrown. A second and more likely explanation is that \\"pig\\" refers to rival Montana State University (MSU) toward whom the song was originally directed.

In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This perennial grass forms a large, dense tuft of stout stems which may just exceed one meter in maximum height. It has a fibrous root network and no rhizomes. The roots are generally colonized by various mycorrhizae. The leaves are mostly located at the base of the stems. They feature a ligule which may be nearly one centimeter in length. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 17 centimeters long with spikelets borne on spreading branches a few centimeters long.Festuca thurberi. Grass Manual Treatment. This grass often occurs at high elevations. It can be found in alpine climates. It grows in several habitat types, usually in cool, dry areas. It is a dominant species in a number of regions throughout its range, growing in forest and woodland understory; it is an indicator species for a number of forest understory types. It occurs at elevations above Arizona fescue but below sheep fescue, with some overlap. It is more often a dominant grass at high elevations than the latter. It is associated with forests of quaking aspen in much of its region. In this habitat it can form a dense, tall, productive understory. In the Rocky Mountains it often begins its growth under the snowpack, producing chlorotic leaves until it encounters sunlight. Some meadows and grasslands are dominated by this species. This grass provides an adequate forage for livestock, more so for cattle than for sheep. Sheep probably find the grass less palatable because of its rough leaves. Cattle grazing in quaking aspen communities consume this grass in large quantities. Many wild animals such as elk utilize the grass as well.

Founders of Presidium Convent were the five oldest Latvian student corporations: Lettonia, Selonija, Lettgallia, Talavija, Fraternitas Lettica. In the interwar period many new Latvian student corporations were admitted to Presidium Convent. In 1920s all Baltic-German corps (Curonia, Fraternitas Baltica, Concordia Rigensis, Fraternitas Rigensis, Rubonia, Gotonia) were also admitted. However, in 1932 all left in protest at a decision that the Latvian language must be used in Presidium Convent meetings. In 1940, after Soviet occupation of Latvia, Presidium Convent were closed, like other Latvian student organisations. After the Second World War most of Latvian student corporations renewed their work in exile. In such conditions, it was impossible to renew Presidium Convent in its pre-war shape, so in 1949 a new global organization was formed which united all Latvian student corporations in exile, the Union of Latvian Corporations (Latvian: Latvijas KorporƒÅciju apvienƒ´ba).

The film is a remake of the 1933 French film, Une vie perdue,per TCM host, Ben Mankiewicz, introduction on September 22, 2012. written by Jacques Deval. Plot Francoise is a jealous wife who spies on her playwright husband, Paul, one evening after a play and overhears him and his lover Odette, the star of the show, quarreling in the street about him leaving his wife. He protests because he does not want to hurt his wife. Paul comes home at 3am and finds that Francoise has waited up for him. Unbeknownst to him, she is distressed at the news and pretends that she knows nothing of the affair. She attempts to seduce him but fails. The more he tries to tell her that he's leaving her, she becomes increasingly agitated, speaking more rapidly as she backs out the door and leaves him alone in the bedroom. The next morning, Francoise sees a lawyer to find out how she can keep Paul from divorcing her and learns that there is nothing legally she can do to compel him to stay. That night at the theater, Paul tries to tell Odette why he was not able to tell Francoise he is leaving her. She is upset as he has promised and failed at this before. He promises to leave Francoise that night and Odette tells him that she will not kiss him again until he has left. Later during the rehearsal, a shot rings and Odette falls to the floor dead. The police are summoned and arrest Castelli, a man who had robbed a bank and killed a teller earlier that day and hid in the theater. However, he swears that he does not know Odette and he did not kill her. As Paul leaves the theater, he finds his own gun tossed into a fire bucket full of water and immediately knows that his wife committed the murder. Later that evening, he confronts her and calls her a fiend. She tells him that she intends not to say anything and at first he threatens to turn her in to the police. Instead he tells her that he will stay and keep her secret to watch her fall apart. Over the months, Fran√ßoise becomes weighted down by her guilt. When she learns that Castelli has been sentenced to death for the murder of Odette, she goes to the district attorney and asks for permission to see the condemned man. Her request is granted and she confesses to him that she murdered Odette. He tells her that she should go away and to never mention it again, he would have been executed for killing the bank teller anyway. Six months later Paul tells Francoise that she is the only person suffering more than him but as long as she won't confess, she will continue to die inside. Later, Paul tells her that she is the only person who can help herself. She then decides to turn herself in for the murder. Paul says that he will stand by her throughout her upcoming ordeal. On her way to the attorney general's office, she saves a boy from being killed by a truck, but she gets hit instead and sustains a critical head injury. The doctor tells Paul that while Francoise will live, she has lost her memory of her entire life and how to do basic functions such as feeding herself, their names and her entire life history. This includes her murder and subsequent guilt. Paul takes Francoise to the south of France and helps her recuperate, as he is convinced that this is God's plan.

Nationals with this status are subject to immigration controls when entering the Taiwan Area, do not have automatic residence rights there, and cannot vote in Taiwanese elections. However, they are exempt from conscription. Most individuals with this status are children born overseas to Taiwanese citizens. About 60,000 NWOHRs currently hold Taiwanese passports with this status.  Terminology  Although NWOHR status only has one Chinese-language name, the Ministry of Justice has used several English translations. These include: \\"nationals without registered permanent residence in the Taiwan Area\\", Article 3. \\"non-citizen ROC nationals\\", Article 16. \\"unregistered nationals\\", Articles 12, 13, 21, 22. \\"Overseas Chinese having not established household registration in the Republic of China\\", Article 3. and \\"people without nationalities in Taiwan\\". Article 21. The Taipei Times occasionally uses \\"nationals without citizenship\\".  Background  The Republic of China (ROC) governed mainland China from 1912 to 1949.. The islands of Taiwan and Penghu were ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 by Qing China, the last ruling dynastic Chinese regime, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. Control of these islands was transferred to the ROC in 1945 after the Second World War.. Near the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government was forced to retreat to Taiwan by the Communist Party, which subsequently established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Since the conclusion of the war, the ROC has controlled only the Taiwan Area.. The ROC continues to constitutionally claim areas under PRC control (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau) as part of its territory. Because of this, Taiwan treats residents of those areas as ROC nationals. Additionally, because Taiwanese nationality law operates under the principle of jus sanguinis, overseas Chinese and Taiwanese are also regarded as nationals.. During the Cold War, both the ROC and PRC governments actively sought the support of overseas Chinese communities in their attempts to secure the position as the legitimate sole government of China. The ROC also encouraged overseas Chinese businessmen to settle in Taiwan to facilitate economic development. Regulations concerning evidence of ROC nationality by descent were particularly lax during this period, allowing many overseas Chinese the right to settle in Taiwan.. From the late 1980s, Taiwan developed a stronger sense of local national identity and more readily asserted its separate identity from that of China. Legal reforms between 1999 and 2002 greatly reduced the ease by which further grants of ROC nationality were made to overseas Chinese and restricted citizenship rights only to those with household registration in Taiwan.. Full citizenship rights, including permanent residence and voting, can only be exercised by nationals who have been registered.. NWOHRs are now treated as an external population to Taiwan.. Nationals of Mongolia, which was part of Qing China until 1911, were also regarded as if they were mainland Chinese residents until 2002, when the Mainland Affairs Council removed the country from the administrative definition of the Mainland Area. Since then, Mongolians have been treated as foreigners and are required to apply for visas before entering Taiwan. Nevertheless, the area of Outer Mongolia remains officially part of ROC territorial claims. Among the NWOHRs living in Taiwan, many of them are ethnic Chinese from the Philippines descended from ROC nationals. A significant portion also come from Myanmar and Thailand, where Republic of China Army detachments fled to after the Chinese Civil War. Descendants of these soldiers entered Taiwan on forged or stolen passports, often to enroll in universities. Because they were not considered nationals of the countries they traveled from, they could not be deported. 875 of these descendants and 107 members of the Tibetan diaspora were granted amnesty in 2009, allowing them to apply for residency.  Acquisition and loss  This ROC passport does not have a national identification card number listed in its details page, meaning that the holder is a national without household registration. Legislation governing Republic of China nationality applies to an extremely broad group of people. All persons of ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese origin, regardless if they have resided overseas for an extended period of time, are technically ROC nationals. Consequently, children born overseas to any of these people automatically acquire ROC nationality at birth. Furthermore, because of Taiwan's continuing claims over areas controlled by the People's Republic of China, PRC nationals from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau are also considered ROC nationals.. Because only nationals born in ROC-controlled areas are automatically given household registration, any person claiming ROC nationality by descent or through connection with PRC-controlled areas would be NWOHRs. Article 6. Foreigners who acquire ROC nationality do not acquire household registration as part of the naturalization process and are also NWOHRs until they register for permanent settlement in Taiwan. Article 9. Requirements for acquiring documentation from the Taiwanese government certifying NWOHR status for non-naturalized nationals differ depending on which region of Greater China applicants originate from, whether they or their parents have ever held an ROC passport, and if they have registered as overseas Chinese at a Taiwanese diplomatic mission. Children born overseas to nationals already holding ROC passports are subject to no additional requirements other than providing sufficient proof of a parent's nationality.. More than 30 million people are estimated to be eligible to claim passports through nationality by descent. Individuals from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau who do not also possess household registration in Taiwan are generally ineligible for passports and must obtain specific approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be granted exceptions. Article 6. However, Hong Kong and Macau residents who had established overseas Chinese status before the end of colonial rule are exempt from this requirement and continue to be regarded as if they were other overseas Chinese. Article 4. Residents originating from PRC-controlled areas who currently live overseas and have lived there for more than four years with established permanent residence may be issued passports if: they have been married to Taiwan Area persons for more than two years, or have children; and have special skills in their professional fields, or made extraordinary contributions to Taiwan. Articles 16, 17. Mainland Area persons must additionally surrender their Chinese passports. Article 16. Hong Kong and Macau residents are ineligible if they possess foreign travel documents, except for British National (Overseas) passports and Portuguese passports originally acquired before Macau's transfer in 1999. Residents from these areas may also be granted passports if they are invited to represent Taiwan in international competitions or under special discretionary circumstances, and if they currently live either in Taiwan or overseas. Articles 15, 16. NWOHRs may voluntarily relinquish the status by application to the Ministry of the Interior, provided that they have acquired another nationality or are married to foreign nationals. Article 11. The status may be deprived if it was fraudulently acquired. Article 19. All Taiwanese nationals, including NWOHRs, who obtain hukou in mainland China automatically have their passports cancelled and any residence rights in Taiwan revoked. Article 9-1.  Restrictions  Although NWOHRs may travel using a Taiwanese passport, because the status by itself does not give its holders residence rights in Taiwan, they face restrictions when traveling there and are not treated identically to Taiwanese nationals with household registration when entering other countries.  Taiwan  A multiple-entry permit attached to a Taiwanese NWOHR passport allowing its holder to visit Taiwan for up to three months Nationals without household registration are subject to immigration controls and do not have automatic residence or employment rights in Taiwan. They may not enter ROC-controlled areas with only their NWOHR passports. NWOHRs must also present an endorsement letter from an Overseas Community Affairs Council certifying their residency overseas, a Certificate of Alien Registration from South Korea indicating their long-term or permanent residence status there, or an entry permit from the National Immigration Agency. They may also enter Taiwan with an Exit & Entry Permit without having to present a passport. Each visit is restricted to three months, which may be extended once per visit for a further three months. Article 8. NWOHRs given approval to reside in Taiwan are restricted from rights and benefits reserved for full Taiwanese citizens. They are not entitled to hold national identification cards and are given Taiwan Area Resident Certificates instead. The lack of household registration makes them ineligible for national health insurance and automatic workers' compensation coverage. They cannot vote in elections or stand for public office. NWOHRs who concurrently hold foreign nationality are additionally required to apply for work permits to be employed in Taiwan. Article 79. = Obtaining household registration = NWOHRs may request approval to reside in Taiwan for employment, study, investment, or family reunion. They may obtain household registration after residence for a number of years, which grants full citizenship rights in Taiwan. Articles 9, 10. NWOHRs born to Taiwan Area persons may be registered after continuous residence for one year, 270 days per year for two years, or 183 days per year for five years. Article 10. Mainland Area persons are subject to annual immigration quotas limiting the number of people acquiring residence permits and household registration each year. Articles 16, 17. An NWOHR who enters Taiwan with a foreign passport or travel document for stateless people may not apply for residency, unless that person is an NWOHR by naturalization or descent through birth overseas to a Taiwan Area person. Article 12. All NWOHRs who successfully obtain household registration continue to be exempt from conscription until one year after the day they are registered.  China, Hong Kong, and Macau  Because NWOHRs do not have national identification cards, they cannot follow standard procedure that allow Taiwan residents to travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. They must use Chinese Travel Documents instead of their passports when traveling to these places.

IBM did not invent them either. Customers invented clusters, as soon as they could not fit all their work on one computer, or needed a backup. The date of the first is unknown, but it would be surprising if it was not in the 1960s, or even late 1950s.‚Äù The formal engineering basis of cluster computing as a means of doing parallel work of any sort was arguably invented by Gene Amdahl of IBM, who in 1967 published what has come to be regarded as the seminal paper on parallel processing: Amdahl's Law. Amdahl's Law describes mathematically the speedup one can expect from parallelizing any given otherwise serially performed task on a parallel architecture. This article defined the engineering basis for both multiprocessor computing and cluster computing, where the primary differentiator is whether or not the interprocessor communications are supported \\"inside\\" the computer (on for example a customized internal communications bus or network) or \\"outside\\" the computer on a commodity network. Consequently, the history of early computer clusters is more or less directly tied into the history of early networks, as one of the primary motivations for the development of a network was to link computing resources, creating a de facto computer cluster. Packet switching networks were conceptually invented by the RAND corporation in 1962. Using the concept of a packet switched network, the ARPANET project succeeded in creating in 1969 what was arguably the world's first commodity-network based computer cluster by linking four different computer centers (each of which was something of a \\"cluster\\" in its own right, but probably not a commodity cluster). The ARPANET project grew into the Internet‚Äîwhich can be thought of as \\"the mother of all computer clusters\\" (as the union of nearly all of the compute resources, including clusters, that happen to be connected). It also established the paradigm in use by all computer clusters in the world today‚Äîthe use of packet-switched networks to perform interprocessor communications between processor (sets) located in otherwise disconnected frames. The development of customer-built and research clusters proceeded hand in hand with that of both networks and the Unix operating system from the early 1970s, as both TCP/IP and the Xerox PARC project created and formalized protocols for network-based communications. The Hydra operating system was built for a cluster of DEC PDP-11 minicomputers called C.mmp at Carnegie Mellon University in 1971. However, it was not until circa 1983 that the protocols and tools for easily doing remote job distribution and file sharing were defined (largely within the context of BSD Unix, as implemented by Sun Microsystems) and hence became generally available commercially, along with a shared filesystem. The first commercial clustering product was ARCnet, developed by Datapoint in 1977. ARCnet was not a commercial success and clustering per se did not really take off until Digital Equipment Corporation released their VAXcluster product in 1984 for the VAX/VMS operating system. The ARCnet and VAXcluster products not only supported parallel computing, but also shared file systems and peripheral devices. The idea was to provide the advantages of parallel processing, while maintaining data reliability and uniqueness. VAXcluster, now VMScluster, is still available on OpenVMS systems from HP running on Alpha and Itanium systems. Two other noteworthy early commercial clusters were the Tandem Himalaya (a circa 1994 high-availability product) and the IBM S/390 Parallel Sysplex (also circa 1994, primarily for business use). No history of commodity computer clusters would be complete without noting the pivotal role played by the development of Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) software in 1989. This open source software based on TCP/IP communications enabled the instant creation of a virtual supercomputer‚Äîa high performance compute cluster‚Äîmade out of any TCP/IP connected systems. Free- form heterogeneous clusters built on top of this model rapidly achieved total throughput in FLOPS that greatly exceeded that available even with the most expensive \\"big iron\\" supercomputers. PVM and the advent of inexpensive networked PCs led, in 1993, to a NASA project to build supercomputers out of commodity clusters. In 1995 the Beowulf cluster‚Äîa cluster built on top of a commodity network for the specific purpose of \\"being a supercomputer\\" capable of performing tightly coupled parallel HPC computations‚Äîwas invented,http://www.beowulf.org/overview/history.html which spurred the independent development of grid computing as a named entity, although Grid- style clustering had been around at least as long as the Unix operating system and the Arpanet, whether or not it, or the clusters that used it, were named.

The cartoon was nominated for an Academy Award. Plot Oswald goes to a dental clinic for treatment to his cavity problem. While the dentist tries to pull out his damaged tooth, news break out of a radio in the shop, reporting that the king is in serious depression and needs to be cheered up. In this, Oswald abandons his dental treatment, and heads outside to spread the word. In his castle, Old King Cole Jeff Lenburg, \\"The Great Cartoon Directors\\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164. is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helps a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, The Marx Brothers and Jimmy Durante Jeff Lenburg, \\"The Great Cartoon Directors\\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.) also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it. Momentarily, the jester returns to the throne room to see what is happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grows envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle. He then puts a noose around Oswald's neck, with other end of the rope being pulled by three elephants. Oswald finds this ordeal impossible to get out of. It appears the experience at the castle was nothing more than a nightmare as Oswald wakes up and sees himself still at the dental clinic. The dentist, at last, succeeds in extracting the tooth, and Oswald is relieved of his dental worries.

(20 January 2006). Communication in Construction Theory and Practice. Routledge. .  Background  Communication usually involves the transfer of information, a generic term that embraces meaning such as knowledge, processed data, skills and technology. Cheng, E., H. Li, P. Love, and Z. Irani. 2001. Network communication in the construction industry. Within construction, information is exceptionally diverse given the huge number of parties involved with the construction operations Corporate Communication, 61‚Äì71 Communication within project-based environments presents special challenges. This is especially true within the construction industry, where interaction tends to be characterised by unfamiliar groups of people coming together for short periods before disbanding to work on other endeavours.  Importance  Per M.E.L. Hoezen, the author of The problem of communication in construction. > The efficiency and effectiveness of the construction process strongly depend > on the quality of communication. In literature four reasons are mentioned > why improvements in communication are needed. The first reason is that an > improvement in the communication within the building team, in project teams > and between project manager and contractors, could reduce failure. Second, > more open communication at all levels could lead to innovations and better > technical solutions. Third, communication improvements in early phases of > projects would positively influence the quality as perceived by all > stakeholders involved. Finally, improved communication during the briefing > might lead to better decision making, for example less haste in moving to > solutions and better ways of looking at the requirements first.Hoezen, > M.E.L. The Problem of Communication in Construction. University of Twente. > Retrieved 23 December 2011. Communication is essential to all business activities; it enables an organization, and is an integral part of the construction process. Beyond the argument, any improvement in communication can improve an organization's operating effectiveness. Good communication within an organization and between organizations contributing to the construction project can improve motivation levels and improve the processes. Conversely, inadequate communication can result in a demotivated workforce and lead to problems in construction.Emmitt, Stephen; Gorse, Christopher A. (2003). Construction communication. Wiley- Blackwell. . Construction projects are complex and risky, requiring the active participation of all contributors. Co-operation and co-ordination of activities through interpersonal and group communication are essential in ensuring the project is completed successfully. Poor communication, lack of consultation and inadequate feedback are to be found as the root cause of defects in many constructed works. Poor co-ordination and communication of design information lead to design problems that cause design errors. Communication is the one aspect of the management of projects that pervades all others. Given that construction is such a fragmented, dynamic and disparate sector, the challenges of communicating effectively are greater than in most other production environments. Contractually driven relationships, conflict and a lack of mutual respect and trust, all combine to hinder open communication and render the role of the project manager extremely demanding and problematic. Nevertheless, addressing communication in the industry can be seen as a principal enabler for improving the industry in the future.  Issues  Since the early 1940s, literature on communication in construction has appeared, mainly based on the situation in the UK. Many problems concerning communication have been reported, with a focus on intra-supplier communication within the construction sector; demand-supply communication during the design phase; and communication between and within single demand and supply side parties, during whole the construction process. With the globalization of the construction industry, emerging issues in construction communication in international contexts, such as problem-solving in international projects, have started to receive more attention.Handford Michael and Petr Matous (2011) Lexicogrammar in the international construction industry: A corpus-based case study of Japanese-Hong-Kongese on-site interactions in English, English for Specific Purposes, Volume 30, Issue 2, Pages 87‚Äì100.Handford Michael and Petr Matous (2015) Problem-solving discourse on an international construction site: Patterns and practices English for Specific Purposes, Volume 18, Pages 85‚Äì98.

Three prototypes, two piston engined and one turboprop powered, were flown but the Hawk did not go into production. Design and development Design work on the Hawk utility/passenger autogyro began in 1996 and the first prototype, the two seat H2X, first flew on 4 February 1997. It was later modified to include a third seat and renamed the Hawk III. The production prototype, a four-seater named the Hawk 4, was significantly different from the Hawk III in detail but retained the pod and mid-line pusher engine configuration, combined with low stub wings, twin booms and fins. Changes between the Hawk III and 4, apart from cabin revisions to accommodate the extra seat, included a new constant chord, aluminium rotor in place of the earlier tapered, composite blade. The rotor was also lowered and the pitch control levers enclosed within a shallower fairing. The wings and fixed tailplane were cropped, so that they no longer extended beyond the booms and fins, the rudders were shortened so that the tailplane no longer needed cut-outs for their movement and extra, short, inboard rudders were added. Successive engine changes increased the power by almost a factor of two. The Hawk 4 had a steel rotor mast and engine mountings but was mostly aluminium elsewhere, including the rotor, rotor head and propeller. The fuselage was an aluminium semi-monocoque. Some components, such as the nosecone, engine cowling and cabin door were formed from composite materials. The rotor was a semi-rigid or teetering design with a swash plate, rotating at up to 270 rpm. Yaw was jointly controlled by the balanced rudders on the endplate fins and the all-moving inboard rudders. It had a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels mounted at the tips of the stub wings. Two rows of seats accommodated the pilot and up to three passengers; alternatively, the rear seats could be folded to provide baggage space. The Hawk 4 was powered by a 261 kW (350 hp) Continental TSIO-550 air cooled flat- six piston engine, which provided pre-rotation power to the rotor for jump starts and drove a four blade propeller in forward flight. The Hawk 4 first flew on 29 September 1999 and had logged 120 hours by the following April. A second aircraft, initially designated Hawk 4T and powered by a 313 kW (420 hp) Rolls-Royce 250-B17C turboprop driving a three blade propeller first flew on 12 July 2000. It was redesignated Hawk 4 when development of the piston engine version was dropped. It had a taller undercarriage, high set tailplane, endplate fins with rounded extensions below the tailbooms and modifications to the inboard rudders. The Hawk 5 was a planned five seat development. Despite optimistic sales predictions before the 2000 recession, the Hawk did not reach production. Operational history In 2002, the Winter Olympic Games contracted with GBA to provide aerial security over Salt Lake International Airport. The Hawk 4 second prototype bearing the acronym UOPSC (Utah Olympic Public Safety Command) was used for this assignment.‚ÄúOlympic Security Aided by Groen Brother‚Äôs Hawk‚Äù, Aero-News Network Specifications (Hawk 4, piston engine) References External links Hawk Single-engined pusher autogyros 1990s United States civil aircraft ","title":"Groen Hawk 4"},{"id":"34164608","text":"Charles L.

Tiramolla has acquired the unique ability of being able to stretch as he wishes, even for several kilometers, after falling into a large container of rubber. He appeared for the first time in August 1952 as a supporting character in the comic series Cucciolo e Beppe, in the magazine Cucciolo, in the story \\"Il mistero della villa\\" (trad. \\"Mystery of the Villa\\"). The first cartoonist was Giorgio Rebuffi. On 15 July 1959, Tiramolla became the star of an independent magazine of the same name, published by Edizioni Alpe. Umberto Manfrin joined Rebuffi in the role of writer, and later also became cartoonist with the pseudonym of Mamberto. New characters were introduced: the butler Saetta, Ulla√≤ the dog, the \\"Admiral\\", Caucci√π, the Tiramolla's grandson in possession of the same powers of his uncle, the villain Mister Magic and other characters of satirical inspiration such as the accountant Rossi (that symbolize the Italian pedantic) and the Devil's Advocate (inspired by Perry Mason). At the regular series there were flanked almanacs, collections and reprints in an intense schedule of weekly, monthly and quarterly releases. At the end of 1980s, after the editor Giuseppe Caregaro's death, Tiramolla ended its publications. Shortly later, at the beginning of 1990, Tiramolla was re- launched under a new publisher, Vallardi, but the magazine failed to regain the ancient success and finally closed in the middle of 1993.

Beak Bridge crosses Ross Creek, connecting Yeppoon with Cooee Bay and other southern towns along Scenic Highway 10. Community While Ross Creek has no permanent population, it is a major community centre with a park, boat ramp, and public barbecues. Markets at Ross Creek are held every month. Ross Creek is best known for its fishing. On the low tide, muddy sandbars on the southern side of the bridge are revealed, and are a popular place for pumping for yabbies. On the incoming tide, the creek fills to near capacity. Man-made stone walls on either side of the creek, plus a sandy beach at the mouth provide plentiful fishing spots. Whiting, flathead, and silver bream are common catches. Flora and fauna Sandy at its mouth, Ross Creek becomes muddier on the other side of the bridge and is popular for mud crabs. Hectares of low lying land either side of Ross Creek fills at high tide, providing the perfect environment for mangroves to grow. In turn, the mangroves give shelter to crustaceans, prawns, and fish. Queensland Government studies have identified ten different species of mangrove in the Ross Creek- Fig Tree Creek system. Ross Creek is also famous as a breeding ground for colonies of flying foxes. The mangroves provide a permanent home for approximately 2,000 black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto), as well as a seasonal camp for several hundred thousand little red flying foxes (Pteropus scapulatus). History Prior to Local Government Amalgamations in 2008, all areas on the Capricorn Coast were administered by Livingstone Shire Council but are now part of Rockhampton Region. Several trawlers still berth in Ross Creek, the remnants of an intensive sea scallop fishing industry based at Ross Creek up until Rosslyn Bay took shape in the 1970s.

Cedar Park at Taranganba is the central shopping district for the area, and travelling from Yeppoon, it is the last significant shopping precinct until Emu Park. History In the 2006 census, Taranganba had a population of 1,882 people. Prior to Local Government Amalgamations in 2008, the Capricorn Coast was administered by Livingstone Shire Council. From 2008 to 2013, it was part of Rockhampton Region. From 2014, the Shire of Livingstone was re-established and now administers Taranganba. In the 2011 census, Taranganba had a population of 2,430 people. Community Taranganba is a steadily growing community. Several major land developments in Tarranganba and the neighbouring localities of Lammermoor and Taroombal are filling quickly with demand from the mining boom.

He popularized a form of haiku called senry≈´, which is named after him. \\"Senry≈´\\" was the nickname that he adopted when he started judging poetry, and other poetry judges after him also adopted this name. The word senry≈´ means \\"river willow\\" in Japanese. Biography Hachiemon was a government official in the Asakusa district of Edo, a post that he inherited from his father. Monument to Senry≈´ Karai became the judge of Maekuzuke competitions (Â∑ùÊü≥Ë©ï‰∏áÂè•Âêà, Senry≈´hy≈ç Manku Awase) in Edo. The Maekuzuke was a popular style at the time which consisted of a participant adding their own verses to an already existing verse. Karai would judge these verses with a point system. And from there, he collected a hundred thousand of these poems each year, the best of which were distinguished and published. There is a monument for him at the location where he judged the first Maekuzuke in Japan. It has been said that Senry≈´ judged over 2,300,000 verses in his lifetime. In 1765, Senry≈´'s disciple published an anthology of Senry≈´'s selected haiku called Willow Barrel (Haif≈´ yanagidaru, commonly known as just Yanagidaru in Japanese) that reflected Senry≈´'s sense of humor and style. He later published several other anthologies throughout his lifetime that gained in popularity. During the Meiji era, this style of poems became known as senry≈´.

In 1952, Ross met Prestige Records owner Bob Weinstock, who asked her to write lyrics to a jazz solo, in a similar way to King Pleasure, a practice that would later be known as vocalese. The next day, she presented him with \\"Twisted\\", a treatment of saxophonist Wardell Gray's 1949 composition of the same name, a classic example of the genre. She later said of the inspiration for the song: The song, first released in 1952 and later collected on the album King Pleasure Sings/Annie Ross Sings, was an underground hit, and resulted in her winning Down Beat's New Star award. Ross released a second version with the vocalese trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross on their 1960 self-titled album, also known as The Hottest New Group In Jazz. Gramophone described that recording as \\"more lighthearted, perhaps a little more individual\\" than Ross' first release of the song. Covers Joni Mitchell Joni Mitchell covered the song on her 1974 album Court and Spark, featuring Cheech & Chong. In a 1974 interview, when asked why she covered the song, she said: \\"Because I love that song, I always have loved it. I went through analysis for a while this year and the song is about analysis.

The original parish church is at Llangelynnin and the more modern one is in the centre of Llwyngwril. Saint Celynnin is a medieval saint that is traditionally though to be a son of Helig ap Glannog. He and his brothers were all considered saints and the church at Llangelynnin in the Conwy Valley is also dedicated to him. Llwyngwril railway station is a request stop. Another notable building in the village is the Salem Chapel. It is painted blue and is sometimes known as the Blue Chapel, and from the outside looks like a typical Welsh Non-conformist Chapel. However the interior is an elaborate mixture of Gothic-style features including simulated stone staircases, wood carvings, ornate ceilings, arched windows, marble fireplaces and an organ gallery complete with a plywood organ. From the beach dolphins can often be seen in Cardigan Bay. There are many self-catering properties to rent and caravan and camping sites either in or very near to the village, including Sunbeach and Hendre Hall.

Research Pitassi's research has largely focused on proof complexity, a branch of computational complexity theory that seeks upper and lower bounds on the lengths of mathematical proofs of logical propositions within various formalized proof systems. The goal of this study is to use these bounds to understand both the time complexity of proof-finding procedures, and the relative strengths of different proof systems. Research contributions that she has made in this area include exponential lower bounds for Frege proofs of the pigeonhole principle,. exponential lower bounds for the cutting-plane method applied to propositions derived from the maximum clique problem,. exponential lower bounds for resolution proofs of dense random 3-satisfiability instances,; . and subexponential upper bounds for the same dense random instances using the Davis‚ÄìPutnam algorithm.; .

Mrs. Schlorer's Mayonnaise is credited as being the first mayonnaise put in jars and sold commercially in 1907. The first products trademarked by the Schlorer Delicatessen Company were Mrs. Schlorer's Mayonnaise and Mrs. Schlorer's Olivenaise in 1917. History In the early 1900s, Amelia Schlorer of Philadelphia would prepare salads including mayonnaise for church functions and other community events. In 1907, she offered twelve jars for sale in glass jelly jars with typewritten labels held on by rubber bands. They sold in less than an hour, marking the first commercial mayonnaise sold in America. She immediately began production of her bottled mayonnaise in the family kitchen with the help of her two children. They used a European beating machine. As demand rose, the store insisted that Mrs. Schlorer improve the packaging from less of a homemade appearance. Deciding to take a risk, Amelia went to a local glass factory where the minimum purchase was 5 gross or 720 jars. The main criteria that Amelia insisted upon was that a tablespoon easily fit into the jar opening for spooning of the mayonnaise. After six years of mixing, bottling, and labeling by hand for local grocery stores and door-to-door delivery, the Schlorers formed the Schlorer Delicatessen Company which was later known as Mrs. Schlorer's, Inc. Company Information The Schlorer Delicatessen Company was formed in 1913 due to the rising demand for Mrs. Schlorer's Mayonnaise. A four-story and basement factory was built at Water and Mifflin Streets in Philadelphia. The company was owned and operated by Edward Schlorer until his death in 1928. After Edwards death, the company was operated by Edward and Amelia's son Charles Schlorer as president and daughter Anna Schlorer Smith as treasurer. In 1955, Mrs. Schlorer's, Inc. was sold to William H. and E. Donald Burns owners of Atlantic Syrup Refining Corp. Mrs. Schlorer's production was moved from Philadelphia to Vineland, NJ at the same location of Venice Maid Company. In 1991, the label rights were acquired by Connelly Containers, Inc. in Bala Cynwyd, PA. In 1998, the label rights were acquired by Good Food, Inc. in Honey Brook, PA where some of the products are still made today. Advertising In 1942, Mrs. Schlorer's, Inc. copyrighted an advertising jingle used in many radio and television commercials over the next several decades in the greater Philadelphia area. The song, written by Bertram May and Billy James, helped establish some familiarity with Mrs. Schlorer's Mayonnaise as a staple when making a sandwich.

Plantagenet Ancestry, Genealogical Publishing, 2005. pg 565. Google eBook) was an English landowner and elected Member of Parliament six times between 1435 and 1459. He was great-grandfather of Queen Catherine Parr, the sixth wife of King Henry VIII. Ancestry The Parr family originally came from Parr, Lancashire. Sir Thomas's grandfather, Sir William de Parre (died 1405), son of Sir John de Parre, lord of Parr; married, in 1383, Elizabeth, daughter of John de Ros, and granddaughter and heiress of Sir Thomas de Ros, Baron of Kendal. Biography Sir Thomas was the son of Sir John Parr and Agnes Crophull (or Crophill) (c.1371/72-3 February 1438). By his mother's previous marriage to Sir Walter Devereux of Weobley, he was the maternal half-brother of Elizabeth and Walter Devereux, Esq., the great-grandfather of Anne Devereux who married William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1468 creation). His father died before 6 October 1407 and when his mother remarried to John Merbury, Esq. he was made the ward of Sir Thomas Tunstall of Thurland Castle, Lancashire. About 1413 Susan James, 1991 Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian & Archaeological Society, Vol. LXXXI, pp. 16-17 he married Alice Tunstall, the daughter of Sir Thomas. Within a year of his coming of age Thomas was escheator of Cumberland and Westmorland, and was knighted about the same time. He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland five times (in 1435, 1449, 1450, 1455 and 1459) and once for Cumberland (1445). He was actively involved in local administration and law enforcement, and became very influential. In 1435 he acted as the Under-sheriff for Thomas, 8th Baron Clifford, the hereditary sheriff of Westmorland. He became involved in a long-running feud with Sir Henry Bellingham, another local landowner, which came to a head in 1445 when he was attacked in London by Bellingham's men when attending Parliament, which caused a Parliamentary outcry. By the time of the War of the Roses, Parr had formed close links with leading Yorkist Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury and when hostilities began joined him at the Battle of Ludford Bridge near Ludlow in 1459. After the Yorkists were defeated, he was forced to flee to Calais with Salisbury and was attainted in Parliament, but returned to fight at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460. He died in 1461. Descendants By Alice Tunstall, he left three sons and six daughters. His eldest son, William became elevated as Baron Parr and married a granddaughter of the Earl of Salisbury, Hon. Elizabeth FitzHugh, and by her was grandfather of Queen Catherine, wife of Henry VIII; his second son, Sir John Parr was made sheriff of Westmorland for life in 1462. His third son, Thomas, was killed at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. His daughters all married members of prominent northern families. Mabel married Humphrey Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre; thus becoming the first female Parr to marry into the peerage and be given a title. The accession of the Yorkist King Edward IV in 1461 had saved most of Sir Thomas's estates from confiscation. Legacy Through his son William, the family continued in favour with the culmination of his granddaughter, Catherine, becoming Queen consort of England and Ireland to King Henry VIII in 1543. His other grandchildren and the siblings of Queen Catherine would be raised by being created Marquess of Northampton and Earl of Essex; while a granddaughter, Anne, would become Countess of Pembroke as the wife of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke of the 1551 creation. Anne's descendants to this day hold the title of Earl of Pembroke among other prominent titles.

In a career that lasted from 1871 to 1873 he ran ten times and won five races. In June 1871 he won The Derby on his second racecourse appearance. He went on to prove himself a top class stayer, winning the Goodwood Cup in 1872. Favonius was regarded by contemporary observers as one of the best English-trained horses of his era. At the end of the 1873 season he was retired to stud but had little chance to make an impact as a stallion before his death four years later. Favonius‚Äôs Derby win was one of the highlights of what became known as ‚ÄúThe Baron‚Äôs Year‚Äù, in which his owner, Baron Meyer de Rothschild won four of the five British Classic Races. Background Favonius was bred by his owner, Baron Meyer de Rothschild. He was sired by Parmesan, a male-line descendant of the Byerley Turk. Parmesan won the Gold Vase at Royal Ascot and became a highly successful stallion siring, in addition to Favonius, the 1871 Derby winner Cremorne. Favonius‚Äôs dam Zephyr, was a full sister to Hannah, who won the Fillies‚Äô Triple Crown in ‚ÄúThe Baron‚Äôs Year‚Äù. Rothschild sent the colt to his private trainer Joseph Hayhoe at his Palace House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Until 1946, British racehorses were allowed to race without being officially named, and until shortly before his Derby win, Favonius was known as ‚ÄúThe Zephyr Colt‚Äù. Racing career 1871: three-year-old season The Zephyr Colt was slow to mature and did not race as a two-year-old. He made his debut in the spring of 1871 in a Biennial Stakes at Newmarket. He was beaten a head by Albert Victor. In mid-May Hayhoe tried the colt in a private trial race against Hannah, which convinced him that the colt was sixteen pounds superior to the filly. Baron Meyer de Rothschild In the Derby at Epsom, the newly named colt started at odds of 9/1 in a field of seventeen runners, with Bothwell being made the 2/1 favourite. The appearance of the name \\"Favonius\\" on the race card reportedly caused some confusion among racegoers who were unaware that the Baron had decided to name the Zephyr Colt after the personification of the West Wind. The crowd included the Prince of Wales who viewed the race from a private stand near the judge's chair. Ridden by Tom French, Favonius made little show in the early stages, but moved up to track the leaders entering the straight. He made steady progress to take the lead inside the final furlong and won easily by one and a half lengths from Albert Victor and King of the Forest who dead-heated for second place. The win was extremely popular with the huge crowd, and the Baron, identifiable by his white hat was mobbed by wellwishers as he attempted to return to his carriage. Rothschild was reported to have given ¬£1,000 to Tom French for his ride on Favonius, with an additional ¬£200 annuity for life. In July, Favonius won the Midsummer Stakes at Newmarket. On 27 July he ran in a much anticipated race for the Goodwood Cup in which he has matched against the French-trained Ascot Gold Cup winner Mortemer. Favonius defeated the French horse, but was beaten half a length in a \\"most sensational race\\" by the 50/1 outsider Shannon to whom he was conceding ten pounds The very slow pace at which the race was run in the early stages led some commentators to consider the result a \\"fluke\\". In the Brighton Cup over two miles, Favonius started 4/6 favourite and won easily by three lengths. Favonius had not been entered for the St Leger and did not race again until October when he appeared at Newmarket. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap he finished unplaced carrying a weight of 123 pounds. He walked over at Newmarket later in the month, after only rival, Sterling, was withdrawn to pursue a match against the American champion Harry Bassett. Favonius's winning prize money of ¬£5,900 contributed towards Baron Rothschild being the leading owner of 1871. 1872: four-year-old season In 1872, Favonius was aimed at the major staying races. Early in the year, Rothschild had reportedly turned down an offer of ¬£12,000 for the colt. On his first start of the year he easily defeated Dutch Skater in a two-mile race at Newmarket in May. At Ascot in June he started 2/5 favourite for the Gold Cup in front of a crowd which included the Prince of Wales and many other members of the British aristocracy. He looked impressive in the paddock and took the lead in the straight but was beaten by the French colt Henry. Two days later he ran in the Alexandra Plate over three miles and finished fourth behind Musket In July he ran in his second Goodwood Cup and produced one of his best performances, taking the lead early in the straight and drawing clear to win by ten lengths from Albert Victor. 1873: five-year-old season In his only race as a five-year-old, Favonius ran in the Goodwood Cup for a third time. He finished second to Flageolet, with Cremorne finishing tailed-off in third. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Favonius was ranked thirty-third, having been placed in the top ten by seven of the contributors. He was the third highest-placed Derby winner of the 1870s and the sixth highest British horse of his decade behind Isonomy. Stud career Favonius was retired to his owner‚Äôs Mentmore stud. He stood for only four seasons before his death from a form of \\"Typhoid fever\\" in August 1877 when he was valued at ¬£12,000. His most notable offspring was Sir Bevys, who won the Derby in 1879.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History The Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railroad line was laid through what is now Ironwood in 1884. At the time there were almost no people in the settlement, but the railroad and the surrounding virgin timber made the city a boomtown, which swelled to 11,000 people by 1892. The railroad had originally constructed a wood-frame building for use as a depot in Ironwood, but it quickly proved inadequate. In 1892, the company built this brick replacement at a cost of $18,000. The Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western became part of the Chicago and North Western Railway soon after. The station was used for passenger traffic until 1970, and freight until 1981. In 1983, the former depot was purchased by the Downtown Ironwood Development Authority. It currently houses the Ironwood Area Historical Society. Description Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Depot, c. 1910 The Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Depot in Ironwood is a red brick and sandstone structure with a one-block long platform. It has a multi-level hipped roof covered with slate. The depot consists of a single-story main depot with a small second story space in the center and a separate, single- story baggage unit with a small modern addition. The two portions are joined with a single roof and measure approximately 175 feet by 28 feet. The two buildings have vertically laid brown sandstone slabs on the bottom of the walls, rising to a height of about 5-1/2 feet. The walls are brick above. The depot's lower story has simple rectangular doorways and windows with one-over- one double hung windows. A triple-window bay which once housed ticket windows projects from the center of the trackside facade. The small second floor has three round-head window with sandstone sills, deeply recessed between sandstone columns with foliated capitals. The projecting eaves of the main hipped roof are supported by large curved wooden brackets. The interior of the main depot contains a train dispatcher's quarters and locker room on one side, a ticket office in the center, and a passenger waiting room and rest rooms on the other side. The walls are plastered and painted white, and the floors are wooden. Many of the interior details are original, including the wainscoting, window trim, baseboards, and ceiling molding. The second story originally housed a railroad agent's office and small store room. The baggage structure has three rooms, one of which is the small addition.

It was established by the Amora Samuel of Nehardea, one of the great sages of Babylon. History Samuel founded the academy at Nehardea, which in time attracted thousands of students. Along with Sura Academy founded by Abba Arika (\\"Rav\\"), it opened a new era in which Babylon became the center of Judaism. After Abba Arika's death, many students from Sura moved to Nehardea. Despite the fact that Rav Kahana III's Pum-Nahara Academy was subordinated to Sura Academy, from the time Arika died the heads of the Nehardea Academy came to visit Rav Kahana in Pum-Nahara with the intention of strengthening the ties between the two academies. This reinforcement of ties is attested by the fact that Kahana III gave his funeral oration to Rav Zevid of Nehardea at Pum- Nahara,B. Talmud, Tractate Mo'ed Katan, 27a a funeral oration, most probably in conjunction with the fact that Rav Kahana III was a disciple of Rav Zevid of Nehardea.B. Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, 69b R. Nahman of Nehardea visited Rav Kahana III in Pum-Nahara on the eve of Yom Kippur;B. Talmud, Tractate Hullin, 95b it is possible he came in order to participate with them in the prayers of the holy day. The academy had a special custom to show respect for the sages of The Land of Israel: When a guest came from the Land of Israel, he taught in the presence of the dean and all students. After the class ended, a long and lively debate was conducted in which the students would inundate the guest with academic questions. Among the scholars who attended the Nehardea Academy, there were known Amoraim sages cited in the Talmud, such as R. Shimi of Nehardea,Cited in Yoma R. Dimi of Nehardea, Rav Zevid of Nehardea, and Amemar. In many Talmud citations,B. Talmud, Tractate Bava Batra, 31a, and more there is a mention of Nehardea's academy methods, however Amemar states that despite the fact that he is a Nehardean, he thinks otherwise. It is unclear whether he meant that Nehardea's academy thinks otherwise and not as what is known to be the methods, or was he an independent in his thinking. After the death of Samuel, the academy split. The academy itself, headed by Rav Huna, a disciple of Samuel, moved to Sura, while another student of Abba Arika and Shmuel, Judah ben Ezekiel, founded the Pumbedita Academy. However, Judah ben Ezekiel and his followers regarded Rav Huna as Gedol haDor,◊©◊ô◊ó◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊†◊ï◊¢◊® until upon his death in 297 (Hebrew calendar: ◊ì\\"◊ê ◊†\\"◊ó or ◊ì'◊†\\"◊ó ).Yud Shin Tzuri, Rav Ashi, p. 19 In some cases, where there is disagreement among scholars, the Nehardea academy practiced Raba bar Rav Huna view,B.

It runs from Berlin to Werneuchen and formerly extended via Wriezen to J√§dickendorf (now Godk√≥w in Poland). Its terminus in Berlin from 1903 to 1949 was the Wriezener Bahnhof (Wriezen line station). The predominantly single-track line has operated only between Berlin-Lichtenberg station and Werneuchen since December 2006. Route The line formerly branched off at Friedrichsfelde Ost from the Eastern Railway and ran to the north. Just after the first curve, there was Friedrichsfelde Friedhof station, serving Berlin's central cemetery. After two more curves, the line ran to the north-northeast. The section within the Berlin outer ring is not used today, trains now branch off the outer ring after Springpfuhl station on to the Wriezen line. Marzahn and Ahrensfelde both have freight yards and passenger stations. The line to Ahrensfelde is also served by S-Bahn line S 7. After Ahrensfelde the line turns more to the east, along the road to Bad Freienwalde. After Tiefensee, the line swung away from the road, running to the east for a while, and then to the north, where about 55 km from the junction with the Eastern Railway, it used to reach its terminus at Wriezen. From here, there were connections to Eberswalde, Frankfurt (Oder), Angerm√ºnde and K√∂nigsberg in der Neumark (now Chojna). Trains on the extension to K√∂nigsberg, which was opened in 1892, usually continued to Berlin on the Wriezen Railway. History  In 1866, the Eberswalde‚ÄìFrankfurt (Oder) railway was opened. According to the initial plans of 1863, it was intended that there would be a perpendicular link from Berlin via Freienwalde and Zehden (now Cedynia) towards Neumark arise, but this line was not built. Around 1870, Alexis Graf (count) von Haeseler, who was the administrator of the Landkreis (district) of Oberbarnim from 1845‚Äì1874 and had an estate in Harnekop, sought the implementation of these plans. He also offered to provide his own land free of charge, if necessary, for the establishment of the route of the line. It is it likely that the change of the route was due to Haeseler‚Äôs influence. In 1863 the route from Tiefensee along the existing highway through Freienwalde and Zehden to K√∂nigsberg was shorter and easier to build. It was now planned instead to build a railway line through Wriezen, which was longer and avoided almost all settlements, with the exception of Wriezen, and ran across undulating undeveloped country. However, this route ran past the count‚Äôs estate. The line, as built, runs through uncommonly beautiful scenery, but the stations were mostly far from the towns. In 1873, the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Public Works, Heinrich von Achenbach charged the Mayor of Wriezen with the preparatory work for a railway from Berlin via Wriezen to Konitz (now Chojnice). Thus the government had agreed to the modified route. In 1886, the financing of the Wriezen‚ÄìJ√§dickendorf line was secured under a state guarantee. In 1888, the son of the count, Gottlieb von Haeseler, later a Prussian Field Marshal, revoked the promise previously given by his father to provide land for the construction of the railway. In the meantime, however, its alignment was fixed and in 1889 funds were approved for its construction from Berlin to Wriezen. From its opening until 1944  An administrative building of the former Wriezen line freight yard in Berlin The eastern section from Wriezen to K√∂nigsberg opened to traffic on 20 December 1892. The western section between Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde (then located outside of Berlin, now Berlin-Lichtenberg) and Werneuchen opened to traffic on 1 May 1898. Stations were built in all towns along the line. The middle section from Werneuchen to Wriezen was completed on 15 October 1898. This allowed trains to run all the way from Lichtenberg to Konigsberg. In 1903, the line was extended into Berlin. A satellite station was built north of the Silesian Station, which was then called Schlesischer Bahnhof (Wriezener Bahnsteig), that is Silesian Station (Wriezen platform). In 1924, it was renamed Wriezener Bahnhof (Wriezen line station). Trains ran to Friedrichsfelde junction parallel with the tracks of the Prussian Eastern Railway. This line remained unchanged until early 1945. A halt was opened in 1903 at the Magerviehhof (meat market) between the stations of Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde, and Marzahn. Werftpfuhl station opened in 1907. Line near Ahrensfelde Friedhof Ahrensfelde Friedhof (cemetery) station was opened in July 1908 as a temporary halt. In October 1910, a three-tracked station with a covered central platform and a platform tunnel was opened. This was the third cemetery station on the line, because the next stop after Friedrichsfelde Friedhof station, Marzahn station is also at a cemetery. The introduction of suburban operations was rejected in 1913, as the cost for doubling the track and the elimination of busy level crossings was considered too high. The main reason given was that very few settlements existed and no major settlement was expected on the fields between Marzahn and Ahrensfelde. The Greater Berlin Act of 1 October 1920 meant that the city of Berlin extended to Ahrensfelde. Ahrensfelde station is just within Berlin, while Ahrensfelde village is just over the border. In 1938, the Wriezen line became one of the last lines in the Berlin area to be included in the suburban fare zone, following pressure from, among others, the flying school in Werneuchen. As a result, suburban fares, then and now, continue to Werneuchen. At that time, it was intended to extend electric train operations to Werneuchen. A pair of tracks for the S-Bahn was to be built as far as Ahrensfelde next to the existing track; after that mixed operations of long- distance and S-Bahn services was to be provided. Diesel railcars were to be operated for traffic between Berlin and K√∂nigsberg. This plan were thwarted by the Second World War. Oder bridge  View over the Oder bridge Construction of the railway bridge over the Oder started in 1890. The construction project consisted of two bridges and a causeway in between. Since there were no other bridges in the vicinity, it was built so that it could also be used as a road bridge. In 1910, the bridges were raised by 1.60 metres and the bridges bearings are reinforced to allow heavier trains to operate and larger boats to sail under it. In 1930, a new bridge was built next to the old bridge for the railway. The old bridge was now used only as a road bridge. In February 1945, both bridges were blown up by German troops. The Oder then became the boundary between Germany and Poland. After that the line was owned by Deutsche Reichsbahn as far as the border, the rest was taken over by Polish State Railways. The reconstruction of the Oder bridge lasted until 1955, but the line from Wriezen to Godk√≥w was set aside for military purposes. No trains ever ran over the new Oder bridge. In 1984 (according to another source in 1976) on each side of the line new sidings were built branching off to the Oder dike. This was intended to support a technology developed by pioneers for building a parallel pontoon bridge for the railway in the event of possible damage to the bridge. The system was tested once in 1984 and was no longer operational in 1986. The Oder bridge built in 1955 still exists. In the region there are discussions about a possible opening of the bridge as a border crossing. The Berlin‚ÄìWriezen section of the line 1945‚Äì1990  Marzahn S-Bahn station Passenger operations between Berlin-Lichtenberg and Werneuchen, which was now in the Soviet occupation zone, were resumed in November 1945. Magerviehhof station remained permanently closed. The additional tracks at Ahrensfelde Friedhof station were eliminated and it became a simple halt on a single track as it still is. The extension to Wriezen became operable only in August 1947, since the tracks from Werneuchen to Wriezen had been destroyed in April 1945 by a military railway plough. Wriezener Bahnhof was reopened in May 1947 as the terminus in Berlin, but in December 1949 it was permanently closed for passenger traffic. Of the station‚Äôs buildings only an administration building is preserved. Trains have since started and ended again in Berlin-Lichtenberg station. The second phase of planning for an S-Bahn began in the 1960s and had more concrete results than that of 30 years earlier. Major satellite developments were planned in Marzahn and Ahrensfelde; the S-Bahn would ensure access to the central city. Since 1971, trains have no longer run on the traditional route along the shortest path from Lichtenberg via Magerviehhof to Marzahn, but instead initially continue from Friedrichsfelde on the Eastern Railway east to Biesdorf Cross and from there north on the Berlin outer ring to Marzahn. This change lengthened the route. The old route was used for freight. Later, the connection was severed at the Eastern Railway. A remaining section is still used for freight and is connected the Berlin-Nordost freight yard on the outer ring. From 1976 the electric S-Bahn operated to Marzahn, serving two intermediate stations at Springpfuhl on the outer ring and Karl Maron (now Poelchaustra√üe) just past the junction. The local trains were cut back to start at Marzahn. The trains were initially used mainly by construction workers. The housing estate, built out of pre-fabricated, pre-stressed concrete, was still under construction; the district was completed three years after the opening of the S-Bahn. In 1980, the S-Bahn was extended by two stations to Otto-Winzer-Stra√üe (now Mehrower Allee station) and local trains were again cut back to start there. In 1982, the S-Bahn was extended to its current terminus at Ahrensfelde. Again the local trains on the Wriezen line (which ended mostly in Werneuchen) were cut back and now started in Ahrensfelde. In 1983 Ahrensfelde Nord station was opened. Section from Wriezen to the Oder Neu R√ºdnitz station (2009) The rest of the German section of the line through the Oderbruch was dismantled in late 1945 as reparations to the Soviet Union. The line was restored during the reconstruction of the Oder bridge around 1955. In 1957, passenger traffic was resumed between Wriezen and Neur√ºdnitz, the last station before the Oder bridge. Operations on the line was divided into two sections, with passengers from Berlin having to change in Wriezen. The line was also used for freight until 1965. The last passenger train ran in 1982. The line remained operational for military purposes. The tracks near the Oder bridge were used for the parking of freight wagons around 1990. Track on this section was dismantled by 2000 and a paved bicycle path was created in 2005. The old station buildings have been sold to private users and some of them have been well restored. The bridge over the Alte (old) Oder still exists at Wriezen. Section of the course in Poland On the Polish side, there were passenger services between Godk√≥w (J√§dickendorf) and Siekierki (Z√§ckerick-Alt R√ºdnitz) until 31 July 1991. Freight traffic ended in late 1999. After a special excursion to Siekierki in 2002, the line was closed. Berlin‚ÄìWriezen section since 1990  Line and former station in Leuenberg After the political change in East Germany (Die Wende) in 1990, regional services were again extended to Berlin-Lichtenberg. They go from Ahrensfelde to Lichtenberg without stopping. Even Marzahn station is not served, although it is now the centre of a district with a population that has grown to 160,000. After 1990, the name of Poelchaustra√üe station was changed to honour Harald Poelchau rather than Karl Maron. The S-Bahn line was designated as line S 7 and, in the years after 1990, the Regionalbahn service was called R 7. On 18 April 1998, passenger services were discontinued from Tiefensee to Wriezen. Trains from Berlin then operated only to Tiefensee (every two hours) or Werneuchen (hourly). Wriezen station has since only been served by the tangential Eberswalde‚ÄìFrankfurt line. Freight traffic was also discontinued between Tiefensee and Wriezen. The section between Wriezen and Tiefensee was closed on 15 December 1999. Southwest of Wriezen a short section of the line was dismantled to allow to building of a new section of the B 167 federal highway. From Tiefensee to Sternebeck the line is now used for operating draisines. A heritage railway operates on the line from Sternebeck until shortly before Wriezen (the 59.2 km point at the former Krautwurst junction). It is planned to construct a terminus for the heritage railway‚Äôs operations near the level crossing at Vevais. In 2002, Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn began operating passenger services between Berlin and Tiefensee and the service is now designated as OE 25. Passenger services were abandoned between Werneuchen and Tiefensee at the beginning of the 2006/2007 timetable on 10 December 2006. There are still substantial freight operations to Ahrensfelde and Werneuchen. Since 2006 the municipality of Ahrensfelde and the state of Brandenburg have planned to build a new station in the Ahrensfelde-Rehhahn industrial area on the initiative of a local hotelier. The station was originally planned to go into operation in December 2008. This date could not be met because, although the residents are willing to finance the construction of the station, no agreement has been reached on financing the costs of ongoing operations of the station and the level of fares. Therefore, the municipality wants a private operator. This is not provided for in the Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways, so a change in federal legislation would be required.

It is native to North America, where it is widespread from British Columbia to Ontario in Canada and through the central and Great Lakes regions of the United States. It is a bunchgrass species in the genus Hesperostipa.USDA - Hesperostipa spartea . accessed 6.26.2012 Distribution Hesperostipa spartea is native to the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies of North America. It is also found in grasslands of the Rocky Mountains in Western Canada and the Western United States. This grass is common and is a dominant grass in various prairie and grassland ecosystems in the Great Plains. In Alberta it is codominant with rough fescue on the grasslands. In other areas it may be codominant with little bluestem. It may be a pioneer species or a climax species, occurring in all stages of ecological succession. It thrives on poor soils and it can invade disturbed habitat such as gopher mounds. It can also be a long-term component of climax grassland and prairie. Description This perennial bunchgrass is similar to needle-and-thread grass, but it has longer, wider, paler leaves. It can reach over a metre in height. The roots are known to reach deep into the soil. The inflorescence is a panicle of spikelets. Each fruit has a very long, twisted awn, reaching up to in length.Hesperostipa spartea. Grass Manual Treatment. Retrieved 12-24-2011. As the grass expands or contracts according to the temperature and moisture conditions, the awns twist or untwist to eventually drill the seeds into the soil ‚Äì a phenomenon known as geocarpy. The awns containing several seeds may tangle together and the mass is blown away from the parent plant on the wind. They also stick to animals, another vector of seed dispersal. Hesperostipa spartea has a bunchgrass foliage mass of in diameter NPIN: Hesperostipa spartea . accessed 6.26.2012. The flower stalks are upright and arching, yellow, in late Spring. The seeds are needle-like with sharp tips and long tails. The tails are composed of two different strands that dry at different rates and twist around each other, causing the sharp head of the seed to be driven into the soil. Just behind the sharp, needle-like tip, is a collar of long thick hairs that face backward, preventing the seeds from working their way back out of the soil. Hesperostipa spartea: note the two differently colored strands wrapping around the tails: they twist at different rates depending on the humidity of the air. Agricultural implications This species of grass can have its seeds entangled in sheep's hair while they are feeding, and once entangled it often works its way into the animal's skin. This grass is not ideal for livestock but it is generally palatable, especially in the spring. It is also valuable in the fall when it remains green as other grasses dry out. When the fruit is mature, the long, sharp awns reduce the palatability of the grass. Cultivation Hesperostipa spartea is cultivated as an ornamental grass for native plant gardens and natural landscaping, and as a plant for Great Plains‚ÄîPrairie habitat restoration. Uses Native Americans such as the Omaha and Pawnee made brushes from this plant by tying the awns together and burning off the sharp seeds at the ends.Hesperostipa spartea.

Dehydration stress  Crop plants In nature or crop fields, water is often the most limiting factor for plant growth. If plants do not receive adequate rainfall or irrigation, the resulting dehydration stress can reduce growth more than all other environmental stresses combined. Drought can be defined as the absence of rainfall or irrigation for a period of time sufficient to deplete soil moisture and cause dehydration in plant tissues. Dehydration stress results when water loss from the plant exceeds the ability of the plant's roots to absorb water and when the plant's water content is reduced enough to interfere with normal plant processes.  Global phenomenon  About 15 million km2 of the land surface is covered by crop-land,Ramankutty N, Evan A T, Monfreda C and Foley J A 2008 Farming the planet. Part 1: the geographic distribution of global agricultural lands in the year 2000 Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 22 GB1003 and about 16% of this area is equipped for irrigation (Siebert et al. 2005). Thus, in many parts of the world, including the United States, plants may frequently encounter dehydration stress. Rainfall is very seasonal and periodic drought occurs regularly. The effect of drought is more prominent in sandy soils with low water holding capacity. On such soils some plants may experience dehydration stress after only a few days without water. During the 20th century, the rate of increase in \`blue' water withdrawal (from rivers, lakes, and aquifers) for irrigation and other purposes was higher than the growth rate of the world population (Shiklomanov 1998Shiklomanov I A 1998 World Water Resources‚ÄîA New Appraisal and Assessment for the 21st Century). Country-wise maps of irrigated areas are available.Stefan Siebert, Petra D√∂ll, Sebastian Feick, Jippe Hoogeveen and Karen Frenken (2007) Global Map of Irrigation Areas version 4.0.1.

Severe drought in parts of the U.S., Australia, and Africa in recent years drastically reduced crop yields and disrupted regional economies. Even in average years, however, many agricultural regions, including the U.S. Great Plains, suffer from chronic soil moisture deficits. Cereal crops typically attain only about 25% of their potential yield due to the effects of environmental stress, with dehydration stress the most important cause. Two major trends will likely increase the frequency and severity of soil moisture deficits: * Climate change: Higher temperatures are likely to increase crop water use due to increased transpiration. A warmer atmosphere will also speed up melting of mountain snow pack, resulting in less water available for irrigation. More extreme weather patterns will increase the frequency of drought in some regions. * Limited water supplies: Increased demand from municipal and industrial users will further reduce the amount of water available for irrigated crops. Although changes in tillage and irrigation practices can improve production by conserving water, enhancing the genetic tolerance of crops to drought stress is considered an essential strategy for addressing moisture deficits.  Plant physiology  A plant responds to a lack of water by halting growth and reducing photosynthesis and other plant processes in order to reduce water use. As water loss progresses, leaves of some species may appear to change colour ‚Äî usually to blue-green. Foliage begins to wilt and, if the plant is not irrigated, leaves will fall off and the plant will eventually die. Soil moisture deficit lowers the water potential of a plant's root and, upon extended exposure, abscisic acid is accumulated and eventually stomatal closure occurs. This reduces a plant's leaf relative water content. The time required for dehydration stress to occur depends on the water-holding capacity of the soil, environmental conditions, stage of plant growth, and plant species. Plants growing in sandy soils with low water-holding capacity are more susceptible to dehydration stress than plants growing in clay soils. A limited root system will accelerate the rate at which dehydration stress develops. A plant's root system may be limited by the presence of competing root systems from neighbouring plants, by site conditions such as compacted soils or high water tables, or by container size (if growing in a container). A plant with a large mass of leaves in relation to the root system is prone to drought stress as the leaves may lose water faster than the roots can supply it. Newly planted plants and poorly established plants may be especially susceptible to dehydration stress because of the limited root system or the large mass of stems and leaves in comparison to roots.  Other stress factors  Aside from the moisture content of the soil, environmental conditions of high light intensity, high temperature, low relative humidity and high wind speed will significantly increase plant water loss. The prior environment of a plant also can influence the development of dehydration stress. A plant that has been exposed to dehydration stress (hardened) previously and has recovered may become more drought resistant. Also, a plant that was well-watered prior to being water-limited will usually survive a period of drought better than a continuously dehydration-stressed plant.  Mechanisms of Drought Resistance  The degree of resistance to drought depends upon individual crops. Generally three strategies can help a crop to mitigate the effect of dehydration stress: The Drought Resistance terms in summary (Levitt, J. (1980);Levitt, J. (1980). Responses of plants to environmental stresses. New York, Academic Press Blum, A. (2011) Blum, A. (2011). Plant breeding for water-limited environments. New York, Springer)  Avoidance  If the plant shows dehydration avoidance, the environmental factor is excluded from the plant tissues by reducing water loss (\\"water savers\\", e.g. by thick leaf epicuticular wax, leaf rolling, leaf posture) or maintaining water uptake (\\"water spenders\\", e.g. by growing deeper roots). Dehydration avoidance is desirable in modern agriculture, where drought resistance requires the maintenance of economically viable plant production under dehydration stress. The role of dehydration avoidance is maintaining water supply and sustaining leaf hydration and turgidity with the purpose of maintaining stomatal opening and transpiration as long as possible under water deficit. This is essential for leaf gas exchange, photosynthesis and plant production through carbon assimilation.  Tolerance  If the plant shows dehydration tolerance, the environmental factor enters the plant tissues but the tissues survive, by e.g. maintaining turgor and osmotic adjustment.  Escape  Dehydration escape involves e.g. early maturing or seed dormancy, where the plant uses previous optimal conditions to develop vigor. Dehydration recovery refers to some plant species being able to recuperate after brief drought periods. A proper timing of life-cycle, resulting in the completion of the most sensitive developmental stages while water is abundant, is considered to be a dehydration escape strategy. Avoiding dehydration stress with a root system capable of extracting water from deep soil layers, or by reducing evapotranspiration without affecting yields, is considered as dehydration avoidance. Mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment (OA) whereby a plant maintains cell turgor pressure under reduced soil water potential are categorised as dehydration tolerance mechanisms. Dehydration avoidance mechanisms can be expressed even in the absence of stress and are then considered constitutive. Dehydration tolerance mechanisms are the result of a response triggered by dehydration stress itself and are therefore considered adaptive. When the stress is terminal and predictable, dehydration escape through the use of shorter duration varieties is often the preferable method of improving yield potential. Dehydration avoidance and tolerance mechanisms are required in situations where the timing of drought is mostly unpredictable. Drought resistance mechanisms are genetically controlled and genes or QTL responsible for drought resistance have been discovered in several crops which opens avenue for molecular breeding for drought resistance.  Drought resistance traits  Resistance to drought is a quantitative trait, with a complex phenotype, often confounded by plant phenology. Breeding for drought resistance is further complicated since several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies can challenge crop plants simultaneously.  Osmotic adjustment  When a plant is exposed to water deficit, it may accumulate a variety of osmotically active compounds such as amino acids and sugars, resulting in a lowering of the osmotic potential. Examples of amino acids that may be up-regulated are proline and glycine betaine. This is termed osmotic adjustment and enables the plant to take up water, maintain turgor and survive longer.  Cell membrane stability  The ability to survive dehydration is influenced by a cell's ability to survive at reduced water content. This can be considered complementary to OA because both traits will help maintain leaf growth (or prevent leaf death) during water deficit. Crop varieties differ in dehydration tolerance and an important factor for such differences is the capacity of the cell membrane to prevent electrolyte leakage at decreasing water content, or ‚Äúcell membrane stability (CMS)‚Äù. The maintenance of membrane function is assumed to mean that cell activity is also maintained. Measurements of CMS have been used in different crops and are known to be correlated with yields under high temperature and possibly under dehydration stress.  Epicuticular wax  In sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), drought resistance is a trait that is highly correlated with the thickness of the epicuticular wax layer. Experiments have demonstrated that rice varieties with a thick cuticle layer retain their leaf turgor for longer periods of time after the onset of a water-stress.  Partitioning and stem reserve mobilisation  As photosynthesis becomes inhibited by dehydration, the grain filling process becomes increasingly reliant on stem reserve utilisation. Numerous studies have reported that stem reserve mobilisation capacity is related to yield under dehydration stress in wheat. In rice, a few studies also indicated that this mechanism maintains grain yield under dehydration stress at the grain filling stage. This dehydration tolerance mechanism is stimulated by a decrease in gibberellic acid concentration and an increase in abscisic acid concentration.  Manupulation and Stability of flowering processes   Seedling drought resistance traits  For emergence from deep sowing (to exploit dry upper soil), this is practised to help seedlings reach the receding moisture profile, and to avoid high soil surface temperatures which inhibit germination.Rosyara, U.R., A. A. Ghimire, S. Subedi, and Ram C. Sharma. 2008.Variation in south Asian wheat germ-plasm for seedling drought resistance traits. Plant Genetic Resources 6: 88-93 Screening at these stage provides practical advantages, specially when managing large amount of germ-plasms.  The Drought Resistant Ideotype  Usually ideotypes are developed to create an ideal plant variety. The following traits constitutes ideotype of wheat by CIMMYT. * Large seed size. Helps emergence, early ground cover and initial biomass. * Long coleoptiles. For emergence from deep sowing * Early ground cover. Thinner, wider leaves (i.e., with a relatively low specific leaf weight) and a more prostrate growth habit help to increase ground cover, thus conserving soil moisture and potentially increasing radiation use efficiency. * High pre-anthesis biomass. * Good capacity for stem reserves and remobilisation * High spike photosynthetic capacity * High RLWC/Gs/CTD during grain filling to indicate ability to extract water * Osmotic adjustment * Accumulation of ABA. The benefit of ABA accumulation under dehydration has been demonstrated (Innes et al. 1984). Innes, P., R.D. Blackwell, and S.A. Quarrie. 1984. Some effects of genetic variation in dehydration-induced abscisic acid accumulation on the yield and water-use of spring J. Agric. Sci. Camb. 102:341 It appears to pre-adapt plants to stress by reducing stomatal conductance, rates of cell division, organ size, and increasing development rate. However, high ABA can also result in sterility problems since high ABA levels may abort developing florets * Heat Tolerance: The contribution of heat tolerance to performance under dehydration stress needs to be quantified, but it is relatively easy to screen for (Reynolds et al. 1998).Reynolds, M.P., R.P. Singh, A. Ibrahim, O.A.A. Ageeb, A. Larque-Saavedra, and J.S. Quick. 1998. Evaluating physiological traits to complement empirical selection for wheat in warm environments. Euphytica 100:85-9 * Leaf anatomy: Waxiness, pubescence, rolling, thickness, posture. These traits decrease radiation load to the leaf surface. Benefits include a lower evapotranspiration rate and reduced risk of irreversible photo-inhibition. However, they may also be associated with reduce radiation use efficiency, which would reduce yield under more favourable conditions. * High tiller survival: Comparison of old and new varieties have shown that under dehydration older varieties over- produce tillers many of which fail to set grain while modern drought resistant lines produce fewer tillers most of which survive. * Stay-green: The trait may indicate the presence of drought resistance mechanisms, but probably does not contribute to yield per se if there is no water left in the soil profile by the end of the cycle to support leaf gas exchange. It may be detrimental if it indicates lack of ability to remobilise stem reserves. However, research in sorghum has indicated that Stay-green is associated with higher leaf chlorophyll content at all stages of development and both were associated with improved yield and transpiration efficiency under dehydration.  Combination phenomics: overall health of crops  The concept of combination phenomics comes from the idea that two or more plant stresses have common physiological effects or common traits - which are an indicator of overall plant health.Rosyara, U.R., Vromman, D., Duveiller, E. 2008.

Journal of Phytopathology Volume 158, Issue 11-12, pages 813‚Äì821 As both biotic and abiotic stresses can result in similar physiological consequence, drought resistant plants can be separated from sensitive plants. Some imaging or infrared measuring techniques can help to speed the process for breeding process. For example, spot blotch intensity and canopy temperature depression can be monitored with canopy temperature depression.Rosyara, U.R., Vromman, D., Duveiller, E. 2008. Canopy temperature depression as indication of correlative measure of spot blotch resistance and heat stress tolerance in spring wheat. J. Plant Path. 90 :103‚Äì107.  Molecular breeding for drought resistance Recent research breakthroughs in biotechnology have revived interest in targeted drought resistance breeding and use of new genomics tools to enhance crop water productivity. Marker- assisted breeding is revolutionising the improvement of temperate field crops and will have similar impacts on breeding of tropical crops. Other molecular breeding tool include development of genetically modified crops that can tolerate plant stress. As a complement to the recent rapid progress in genomics, a better understanding of physiological mechanisms of dehydration response will also contribute to the progress of genetic enhancement of crop drought resistance. It is now well accepted that the complexity of the dehydration syndrome can only be tackled with a holistic approach that integrates physiological dissection of crop dehydration avoidance and - tolerance traits using molecular genetic tools such as MAS, micro-arrays and transgenic crops, with agronomic practices that lead to better conservation and utilisation of soil moisture, and better matching of crop genotypes with the environment. MAS has been implemented in rice varieties to assess the drought tolerance and to develop new abiotic stress-tolerant varietiesSalam, S. A., Sindhumole, P., Waghmare, S. G., & Sajini, S. (2017).

The album was the group's second full-length rock opera, and the story reveals social, musical and psychological events from an English teenager's perspective. The music and songs were composed by Pete Townshend and the story is set in London and Brighton in 1964 and '65. The name of the musical is a variation on the popular usage of the medical diagnostic term \\"schizophrenia\\" as dissociative identity disorder, which reflects the four distinct personalities of Jimmy, the story's protagonist, as well as the personalities of the four members of The Who. History After the rock opera was released in 1973, The Who attempted to perform the album on a supporting tour. However, the effort turned out to be disastrous because of the complexity of the production. The album's music made extensive use of synthesizers and sound effects, which meant the group had to work to backing tapes for live performance. The band was constrained by playing to the tapes, and early performances were plagued by tape malfunctions. The band soon abandoned most of the rock opera in favor of their other hit songs. Only a few of the album's songs would be performed regularly on the group's subsequent tours in 1975-6, 1979‚Äì80, 1981, 1982, and 1989. In 1994 Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, celebrated his 50th birthday by performing a two-night spectacular of Who music at Carnegie Hall, followed by a major tour. This tour attracted attention to songs from The Who's Quadrophenia and gathered support for the staging of a major tour of the rock opera in 1996-1997. In 1996 Pete Townshend was approached to produce Quadrophenia for The Prince's Trust concert at Hyde Park, London. He at first planned to perform the opera as a solo acoustic show using scenes from the film on backing screens, but after receiving offers of financing from Vespa, Townshend decided on a full-out production. The opera was performed with a large backing band, including Daltrey, John Entwistle on bass, Pete Townshend on acoustic guitar and vocals, Zak Starkey on drums, Rabbit Bundrick and Jon Carin on keyboards, Simon Townshend and Geoff Whitehorn on guitar and special guests including Phil Daniels as the Narrator/Jimmy, Gary Glitter as The Rocker, Adrian Edmonson as the Ace Face/Bellboy, Stephen Fry as the hotel manager, Trevor McDonald as the newsreader and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour as the bus driver. Gilmour also played additional lead guitar for that performance. A horn section and backing vocalists were included, along with other actors. Afterward, Townshend decided to take the production on tour in 1996-1997 as The Who. For the subsequent tour of the UK and the US, Daniels was replaced by a filmed narrative, and Gilmour's role as the bus driver was taken over by Simon Townshend. Gary Glitter and P.J. Proby made guest appearances as The Godfather, and Billy Idol also guested as the Ace Face/Bellboy. Townshend and Daltrey toured the rock opera again in 2012-13 without guest singers. The backing band included Simon Townshend on vocals and guitar, Pino Palladino on bass, Zak Starkey on drums, Loren Gold and John Coury on keyboards, J. Greg Miller and Reggie Grisham on horn and Frank Simes as music director. Scott Devours also played drums on part of the tour. Development as a stage musical In November 2005, Luna C Productions staged a theatrical version of Quadrophenia in Los Angeles, starring Stephen Shareaux as Jimmy. Additional performances were produced in March and November 2006. In February 2007, students from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama staged \\"the first independent theatrical production of Quadrophenia blessed by Pete Townshend\\" at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff, Wales. This production was reworked, recast and expanded by Director Tom Critchley and playwright Jeff Young into a successful full-scale UK Tour which launched at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth in May 2009. The four Jimmys were played by Ryan O'Donnell, Rob Kendrick, Jack Roth and George Maguire. Actor Ryan O'Donnell received a 2009 nomination for \\"Best Performance in a Musical\\" from the TMA Theatre Awards for his performance as Jimmy in the stage version of Quadrophenia. As of March 2013, NK Theatre Arts based in Romiley, Stockport, produced the world amateur premiere of the show with the personal permission of Townshend. Spotlight Musical Theatre Group, Beccles, Suffolk, have been given permission from Pete Townshend's Production Company to perform the NK Theatre Arts version of Quadrophenia from 27 June to 1 July 2017 at the Public Hall, Smallgate, Beccles.

The Grey Friar's Abbey (Swedish: Gr√•munkeklostret) on the island of Riddarholmen in Stockholm was a monastery for males of the Franciscan Order, in operation from 1270 until the Swedish Reformation of 1527. History The monastery was founded upon donation by King Magnus III of Sweden in 1270, and in 1288, he also donated the Skeppsholmen area to the abbey. It was because of the abbey that Riddarholmen has been called Gr√•br√∂draholm (Grey Brother's Islet), Munckholmen (Monk's Islet), and Gr√•munkeholm or Gr√•munkeholmen (Grey Friar's Islet). During the 15th-century, the island of Kungsholmen was also called Munkl√§gret (Monk's Camp) because of the activities of the abbey in the area. After the Siege of Tre Kronor (castle) on 9 May 1502, the defeated Queen, Christina of Saxony, was kept prisoner here by Sten Sture the Elder. Dansk biografisk Lexikon / III. Bind. Brandt - Clavus Dissolution In 1527, the abbey was dissolved because of the reformation. The monks were forced to leave the buildings, which were used as a hospital and as a residence for the former nuns of St. Clare's Priory, Stockholm. The hospital was moved to Danviken Hospital in 1551, and the building housed the theological school Collegium Regium Stockholmense in 1576-1593, and the Nicolai Trivial School until 1666. Later history Riddarholm Church is what remains of the abbey in our time. Part of the area south of Riddarholm Church was excavated in 2010.

The group includes the family Cariamidae (seriemas) and the extinct families Phorusrhacidae, Bathornithidae, Idiornithidae and Ameghinornithidae. Though traditionally considered a suborder within Gruiformes, both morphological and genetic studies show that it belongs to a separate group of birds, Australaves, whose other living members are Falconidae, Psittaciformes and Passeriformes. This proposal has been confirmed by a 2014 study of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species. This analysis shows that the Cariamiformes is basal among extant Australaves, while falcons are next most basal; in combination with the fact that the two most basal branches of Afroaves (New World vultures plus Accipitriformes, and owls) are also predatory, it is inferred that the common ancestor of 'core landbirds' (Telluraves) was an apex predator. However, some researchers like Darren Naish feel that this assessment is biased towards the more well known, predatory representatives of the clade, and indeed at least one form, Strigogyps, appears to have been herbivorous.Gerald Mayr, Exceptionally preserved plant parenchyma in the digestive tract indicates a herbivorous diet in the Middle Eocene bird Strigogyps sapea (Ameghinornithidae) The earliest known unambiguous member of this group is Paleocene taxon Paleopsilopterus itaboraiensis. An isolated femur from the Cape Lamb Member of the Lopez de Bertodano Formation, Vega Island, Antarctica was briefly described as a cariamiform femur in 2006. This specimen, which dates to the late Cretaceous period 66 million years ago, was originally reported as indistinguishable from the femurs of modern seriemas, and belonging to a large bird about tall. Because of its age and geographic location, it was argued that this unnamed species may have been close to the ancestry of both cariamids and phorusrhacids. However, a subsequent study published by West et al. (2019) reinterpreted this specimen as a fossil of an unnamed large-bodied member of a non-cariamiform genus Vegavis.

Born in Merthyr Tydfil, John was notable for becoming the Welsh lightweight champion in 1915.Jones (2011) pp. 46-48 He was successful at a domestic level, but his career was curtailed by ill-health. Boxing career John's early professional career was based mainly in Wales. His early successes normally came through points decisions, his victories rarely ended by a knock-out. He won his first competition at the age of 15, weighing in at six stone.Jones (2011) p.46 By the time he won his first recognised national fight, a disqualification win over Young Walters at Cardiff's Badminton Club, he weighed eight stone eight pounds. On the 12 September 1910 he took the Welsh 9 stone 4 pounds title, which resulted in an invitation to fight at the National Sporting Club in London. The next year Johns undertook more fights outside Wales, including bouts in Liverpool, and a win over American Fred Sidney at St James Hall in Newcastle. Towards the end of 1911 his health was affected by rheumatism and defying medical orders, he continued fighting; losing to Tommy Mitchell in Sheffield and a month later he was outpointed by Nat Williams in Liverpool. Even when he took breaks from professional contests, he continued fighting in charity matches, usually with his mentor 'Peerless' Jim Driscoll.Jones (2011) p.47 In 1913, with the now properly constituted Welsh lightweight title set at a nine stone nine pound limit, he fought Arthur Evans in a twenty-round eliminator for a shot at the current title holder, Dai Roberts. He and Evans fought in front of a crowd of 4,000 at Merthyr's Drill Hall with Johns winning by points after the bout went the full distance. Johns' challenge against Roberts ended in farce. The twenty round bout only reached the seventeenth round after the referee, Mr J.W. Thwaites of the National Sporting Club, declared the match a 'no-contest'. He stated that the protestations from a member of Johns corner, trying to bring to his attention infringements by Roberts, distracted him so much that he was unprepared to risk his reputation by giving a verdict. Despite being married with a family, and suffering from rheumatism, on the outbreak of the First World War Johns joined the British Army, being assigned to the Royal Engineers.Jones (2011) p.48 In 1915, Roberts moved up to welterweight, vacating the lightweight title. This led to Johns and Arthur Evans meeting for the title on 22 May at the Cardiff Arms Park. Johns took the fight by points decision making him the Welsh lightweight champion. Johns held the title for just two months, when he again faced Evans this time at Liverpool Stadium where the two men were now stationed. The match, refereed by reigning British welterweight champion Johnny Basham, was halted in the 16th round, when Johns was unable to continue fighting after being knocked down late in the previous round. Johns undertook one more fight after the end of the First World War, a defeat to Danny Arthurs in Merthyr. Johns died of pneumonia in Merthyr Infirmary on his birthday in 1927. He is buried at Cefn Coed Cemetery in Merthyr.

It features the voices of Ed Asner, Betty White, and Tim Curry. The special presents an origin story for Santa Claus, who is depicted as a man named Nicholas Claus who wishes to give every child in the world a gift for Christmas. The elves of the North Pole become obligated to grant his wish, facing great obstacles. Plot The story opens in \\"Europe, a long time ago\\". Nicholas Claus, nicknamed \\"Santa\\" by his wife Gretchen, is a toymaker who wishes he could give a toy to every child in the world. It's explained that Nicholas grew up in the Angel's Island Orphanage, where he taught himself to make toys for the other children. However, Nicholas is now in debt because he gives away more toys than he sells. The Clauses are subsequently evicted by their greedy landlord, Mr. Minch, who subsequently forces Mrs. Claus to surrender her wedding ring as \\"payment\\". Now penniless, Nicholas and Gretchen decide to take their remaining toys to the children at the Angel's Island Orphanage. However, their ship is caught up in a storm and they are miraculously transported to the North Pole. There they meet the elves, including wizardly elf Nostros, his son Clement, and the know-it-all elf girl Aurora. When Nicholas saves Clement's life, Nostros is forced to grant him a wish. Nicholas wishes that he could deliver toys to all the children in the world on Christmas. Nostros declares that this is impossible and trying to fulfill it will doom the elves by destroying their magic. However, the wish can't be taken back because it is now \\"etched among the stars\\". Nicholas and Gretchen manage to recruit almost all the elves to help them. Soon they have built a toy factory and gotten to work. Nostros watches from afar, scoffing at their attempt to do the impossible and forbidding Clement from involving himself. Clement sneaks out to help anyway. On the big day, Aurora realizes Nicholas will have to be accompanied by a magical expert on his trip. She goes to Nostros, but he refuses. After thinking about it for a while, he changes his mind and goes to the toy factory to help Nicholas. As their voyage around the world ends, Nicholas insists they make a stop at the Angel's Island Orphanage. He gives a young boy a knife so that he may whittle toys for the others as Nicholas once did. Once they return to the North Pole, Nostros and the other elves vote to bestow \\"honorary elfhood\\" upon the Clauses, making them immortal. Nicholas declares that they shall do this again every year forever and the elves cheer.

He was created Viscount Fairfax in the Peerage of Ireland in 1629. He \\"erected a mansion on Bishophill (York) early in Elizabeth's reign\\". Early life Fairfax was the only son and heir of Sir William Fairfax of Gilling Castle and Walton, Yorkshire, by his second wife Jane Stapleton, daughter and heiress of Brian Stapleton of Burton Joyce. He attended school at Gilling and entered Caius College, Cambridge in 1590. He succeeded his father to the estates of Gilling and Walton in 1597 and was a sheep farmer and an encloser. Career In 1600 he was commissioner for musters for the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1601, he was elected Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge. He was a J.P. for the North Riding of Yorkshire by 1603 and was knighted in April 1603. From July 1603 he was a member of the council in the north, and was vice-president of the council in the north in 1608 and 1616. In 1621, he was elected MP for Hedon.

Personal life Fairfax married Catherine Constable, daughter of Sir Henry Constable of Burton Constable in 1594 and had six sons and five daughters. She was an open Catholic and was convicted of recusancy at regular intervals from 1599 until her death. She does not appear to have been fined, which may be attributable to Fairfax's friendship with Sir Arthur Ingram, Secretary to the Council of the North, and collector, for a time, of recusancy fines. She also employed Catholic maids and escaped penalty for this; and although it was also an offence, at least two of the sons went abroad to Catholic colleges. Before her death in 1626, they were the parents of at least eleven children, including: * Thomas Fairfax, 2nd Viscount Fairfax (‚Äì1641), who married Alathea Howard, daughter of Sir Philip Howard (eldest son of Lord William Howard, a son Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk). * Hon.

Zetra Ice Rink was proposed rebuilt to host speed skating, while the existing Zetra Ice Hall would be upgraded to host short-track speed skating and figure skating. The existing Skenderija II Hall would be used for ice hockey. The existing sliding center at Trebeviƒá was proposed for bobsled, skeleton and luge, while Alpine skiing was proposed at Bjela≈°nica (men) and Jahorina (women).

History  In 1879, Alfred de Meuron set up a small workshop in Geneva to manufacture electrical appliances. This workshop ultimately formed the basis for the establishment of SAAS on 9 July 1918. The following year, 1919, Brown Boveri & Cie (BBC) became SAAS's main shareholder. Five years later, SAAS resumed its independence. The company remained independent until 1969, when competitive pressures forced it to seek new partners. In 1970, BBC took over as sole shareholder. However, the company's name was changed only in 1982, when it became BBC S√©cheron SA. In 1988, BBC finally merged with the Swedish company ASEA to form ASEA Brown Boveri (now ABB Group). The new company chose to split SAAS into four companies, and separate itself from the traction-related manufacturing sector. The decision led to the creation in 1989 of a new independent company, S√©cheron SA, which re-entered that sector. Meanwhile, ABB S√©cheron SA continued the manufacturing of transformers. In 1992, ABB S√©cheron moved out of its previous factory, and let S√©cheron SA occupy the original site alone. The SBB-CFF-FFS Re 4/4 II (left) and Re 6/6 (right) were SAAS products.  Products  The company manufactured the following products: * Electrodes for arc welding; * Mercury-arc valves; * Electrical equipment for hydroelectric power stations; * Electric locomotives, in collaboration with other companies (BBC, SLM or SIG): e.g., Re 4/4 I, Re 4/4 II and III, Re 6/6; * Electric railcars and multiple units, also in collaboration with other companies; * Speed controllers for trains, rapid transit networks, trams and trolleybuses.

It had its head office at Cambridge Airport, Cambridgeshire.\\"Contact Us.\\" ScotAirways. Retrieved on 29 September 2009. \\"Suckling Airways Cambridge Airport Cambridge CB5 8RT UK\\"\\"Local Plan 2004 map 27b - Cambridge Airport.\\" South Cambridgeshire District Council. Retrieved on 6 July 2010. In 2013 it was integrated into its parent company Loganair.  History  The airline was established in November 1984 and started operations in 1986. It was founded as Suckling Aviation by Roy and Merlyn Suckling, originally operating charter services from a grass runway in Ipswich. Roy Suckling had been a flying instructor at Ipswich Flying Club, and his wife Merlyn was a lawyer. Scheduled services began on 26 April 1986 from Ipswich Airport to Manchester and Amsterdam using a single 18-seat Dornier Do 228. The service was distinguished by the friendly 'family' atmosphere engendered by both flight and ground staff. In the winter of 1987, higher than average rainfall began to cause problems at Ipswich Airport, with the grass runway reportedly being damaged by the Suckling Dornier. The damage was particularly acute at the ends of the runway where the aircraft would make its turn. Region Air, the airport operating company, complained vociferously that the Dornier was churning up the runway, and in February 1988, Suckling was forced to temporarily relocate to RAF Wattisham, before finding a more permanent home at Cambridge. Ipswich Airport has subsequently closed. A prominent moment at this time was a lengthy feature about the airline on BBC television's \\"40 Minutes\\" which showed the introduction of the Dornier 228, and the in-flight meals being prepared in a private home kitchen, although by a professional chef. Modest expansion followed the airline's move to Cambridge, and the airline upgraded to the larger Dornier 328. Services to Edinburgh began, as well as a parallel service from Norwich to the Scottish city. By 1999 the airline was carrying 110,000 passengers on its fleet of Dorniers and had started services from London City Airport to Dundee and Glasgow. 295x295px It was during that year that investment was secured from Brian Souter, founder and chairman of the Perth-based transport group Stagecoach and his sister Ann Gloag. Souter and Gloag purchased a 90% stake in the airline for ¬£5m and announced its rebranding as ScotAirways. The Suckling family would remain in charge of the day-to-day management of the airline keeping the head office in Cambridge, while Souter became chairman. A rather ambitious expansion programme began, establishing a hub at London City with services to Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Paris, and also from Inverness and Southampton to Amsterdam. Shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the airline found itself in the midst of the crisis surrounding the aviation industry. Cutbacks were required for ScotAirways‚Äô survival, and the services from Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Paris, Norwich and Cambridge were axed, some only a matter of months since their launch. With the abandonment of Cambridge Airport, Dundee effectively became the base for the carrier‚Äôs reservations and maintenance, while the head office remained in Cambridge. During 2004, the airline marked its recovery by recording its first profit in several years. Frequencies on the remaining routes were increased. The airline carried over 200,000 passengers in 2004, achieving a far higher figure on just three routes than the previous larger network. In the face of heavy competition from British Airways on the Edinburgh to London City route, ScotAirways introduced its first jet aircraft, an 80-seat British Aerospace 146, onto the route on 9 May 2005. Code share arrangements were put in place with Flybe on the Edinburgh service and KLM Cityhopper on the Amsterdam route. On 18 September 2006 it was announced that Ann Gloag and Brian Souter had sold their combined stakes in the airline to Roy and Merlyn Suckling. Between 26 March 2007 and 31 December 2010, ScotAirways operated as a partner airline to the brand new 'CityJet for Air France' concept which took to the skies from London City Airport. ScotAirways operated its existing services to Edinburgh and Dundee as codeshare services with Air France, and in addition launched new services to George Best Belfast City Airport, Strasbourg and Eindhoven from London City Airport on behalf of CityJet. On 10 August 2007 ScotAirways ceased operations on the Southampton-Amsterdam route, and the route to Belfast was discontinued in Spring of 2008. By 2 September 2007 the airline stopped operating its own scheduled services, re-positioning the business to concentrate on ACMI lease work. In November 2007 ScotAirways began providing ACMI services for Channel Islands airline Blue Islands. One Dornier 328 was painted in the Blue Islands livery and operated routes from Jersey Airport to Geneva Airport and Zurich Airport.335x335pxOn 8 July 2011, it was announced that Glasgow based airline Loganair had agreed to buy Suckling Airways. The company continued to trade as a separate airline which held its own licences and approvals until April 2013 when it was fully integrated with Loganair. The airline dropped its trading name of ScotAirways and reverted to its registered name of Suckling Airways in July 2011. The re-brand was part of the deal with Loganair. Due to the cessation of the London City to Edinburgh route by CityJet, it was announced Suckling Airways would close the London City base at the end of October 2013. As of April 2013 Suckling Airways ceased to operate as an airline, with the aircraft being transferred to Loganair. Flight deck, engineering and cabin crew became full Loganair employees. Other staff were made redundant with headquarters functions transferred to Glasgow.  Fleet  Prior to ceasing operations, Suckling Airways operated six Dornier 328 turboprop aircraft. All were transferred to Loganair.Suckling Airways fleet retrieved 4 January 2014  References  External links *Suckling Airways - Official website *Suckling Airways aircraft Defunct airlines of the United Kingdom Airlines established in 1984 Airlines disestablished in 2013 Transport in Dundee British companies established in 1984 ","title":"Suckling Airways"},{"id":"34166280","text":"Elegant Stealth is the twenty-first studio album from rock band Wishbone Ash and the culmination of 2 years of writing and recording sessions.
