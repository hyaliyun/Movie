She was an original disciple of Joseph Pilates, and a master teacher of his technique to generations of instructors. Gentry grew up in San Bernardino, California, and was studying in Los Angeles when Martha Graham saw her perform and offered her a scholarship in New York City. Miss Gentry performed with Hanya Holm's New York company from 1936 to 1942, and later founded her own group, the Eve Gentry Dancers. She danced under the name Henrietta Greenhood until 1945, when she professionally adopted Gentry, her husband's surname. Her concern for preserving choreography led her to establish the Dance Notation Bureau in New York in 1940, with Ann Hutchinson Guest, Janey Price and Helen Priest Rogers. She was also a charter faculty member of the High School for the Performing Arts. Persistent back and knee problems led her to investigate, and later teach, a system of physical conditioning devised by Joseph Pilates. She taught \\"Contrology\\" at the Pilates Studio in New York from 1938 through 1968. Gentry also taught \\"Pilates\\" in the early 1960s at New York University's, Tisch School of the Arts Theater Department. In 1968 she moved to New Mexico, where she established a Pilates Studio on Camino de la Luz and, in 1991, an Institute devoted to the Pilates Method. The first workshop was in October 1991 taught by Gentry using eight Mini-Moves which became the foundation of the Fundamentals which are the signature of the PhysicalMind Institute, the successor to the Institute for the Pilates Method. There are now 28 Fundamentals and they have been copied by most of the subsequent Pilates Certification companies who followed the distribution system originated by Joan Breibart. She died on June 17, 1994, at her home in Santa Fe. She was 84. Awards In 1979, she was given the \\"Pioneer of Modern Dance Award\\" by Bennington College. She was also deemed a Living Treasure by the State of New Mexico.

During his time in office he served as a member of the Executive Council of Alberta from 1971 to 1975 as a Minister without portfolio Responsible for rural development. Political career Topolnisky joined the Progressive Conservatives in 1956 and became politically active in 1959 as a party organizer. Topolnisky ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1971 Alberta general election. He defeated incumbent Social Credit MLA Michael Senych to pick up the new electoral district of Redwater-Andrew for the Progressive Conservatives. His win helped the Progressive Conservatives gain enough seats to form government that year. After the election Topolnisky was appointed to the Executive Council by Premier Peter Lougheed as a Minister Minister without portfolio Responsible for rural development. Topolnisky ran for re-election as an incumbent cabinet minister in the 1975 Alberta general election, he won a slightly higher popular vote easily keeping his seat. After the election the Premier did not renew Topolnisky's cabinet portfolio, he served in the assembly as a private member for the rest of his career. In the run up to the 1979 general election, Topolnisky faces two challengers for the Progressive Conservative nomination in his district. He won a first ballot victory on July 13, 1978. There were over 1,000 people in attendance at the nomination meeting. In the election itself Topolnisky rolled up a slightly bigger popular vote over his 1975 result to win his third term in office.

It is known primarily from osteoderms found from the Tecovas Formation in Texas, which is Late Triassic in age, dating back to the upper Carnian. Material is also known from several other localities of the Chinle Group in New Mexico and Arizona. Specimens of Tecovasuchus have been collected from the Tecovas Formation, the Bluewater Creek Formation, and the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation. Tecovasuchus was first recognized as a new taxon in 1995, although it was not named until the description of the type species, T. chatterjeei, in 2006. Before its description, specimens of Tecovasuchus were thought to belong to Paratypothorax or a Paratypothorax-like aetosaur. Several features of the osteoderms distinguish Tecovasuchus from other aetosaur genera, including dorsal paramedian osteoderms with strongly thickened and beveled posterior edges and ornamentation consisting of deep pits and radiating grooves, as well as tongue-shaped dorsal and plate-like ventrolateral flanges. Tecovasuchus is an index taxon for the St. Johnsian sub-LVF (land vertebrate faunachron) of the Adamanian LVF, and the presence of material belonging to the genus helps correlate different Late Triassic localities throughout the southwestern United States.

The ground floor housed a farmer's market with fresh meat preserved by ice boxes, vegetables, chickens on the sidewalk out front, and two jail cells, segregated by race. Upstairs had an auditorium, opera stage, dressing rooms and the mayor's office. The building was heated by wood stoves and lighted by oil lamps. The auditorium hosted silent movies, Chautauquas, dramas, and other community cultural events. The Apex Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1927 and took its first residence the town hall, parking a fire engine in the left bay of the building, which parked there through 1957. The Fire Department built a separate building across the street in 1958. Apex had a public works building attached to the back for a time, but it was removed to make parking spaces. The DMV had an office in the building for a time. The Town Hall function moved from the building in 1978 to 205 Saunders St. The building was condemned. The town refurbished it and it served as home to the Apex Parks and Recreation department through 2007. The arches on the front sport a decorative capstone.

In 1888 she married Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, the former king of Spain and her uncle.Appleton, p. 447. Maria Letizia became the Duchess of Aosta, Duke of Aosta being a title by which Amadeus was known before and after his kingship. Their marriage was instrumental in almost reviving French hopes of reinstating the Bonaparte dynasty into a position of power, as seen in the days of Napoleon III. Family and early life Maria Letizia's father Napol√©on Joseph was a nephew of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte through his brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. This then made Maria Letizia a great-niece of Emperor Napoleon. Her mother Maria Clotilde was a daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Through this connection, Maria Letizia was a niece of King Umberto I of Italy and Queen Maria Pia of Portugal. Maria Letizia's father Napol√©on Joseph Bonaparte Maria Letizia was born in the Palais Royal in Paris on 20 November 1866, during the last few years of the Second French Empire.Vizetelly, p. 226. She grew up living between Paris, Rome and elsewhere in Italy with her two brothers Napol√©on Victor and Louis. After the fall of the French Empire in 1870, their family resided in a beautiful estate near Lake Geneva.Remsen Whitehouse, p. 313. =State of parents' marriage= Their parents' marriage was unhappy, however, particularly as Maria Clotilde preferred the quieter, more duty-filled life that she felt they should maintain, while Napol√©on Joseph preferred the faster, more entertainment-filled lifestyle of the French court. Another factor in their unhappy marriage was the circumstances leading up to their espousal. Maria Clotilde had been only 15 when they were married, while he had been over 37 years old.Vizetelly, p. 225. The marriage had also been negotiated out of political reasons during the conference of Plombi√®res (July 1858). As Maria Clotilde was too young at the time for marriage, Napol√©on Joseph had had to wait until the following year; many had disapproved of the speed he undertook collecting his young bride in Turin. Their marriage was often compared to that of an elephant and a gazelle; the bridegroom had strong Napoleonic features (broad, bulky, and ponderous) while the bride appeared frail, short, fair-haired, and with the characteristic nose of the House of Savoy. Maria Letizia's mother Maria Clotilde of Savoy The marriage was also unpopular with both the French and the Italians; the latter in particular felt that the daughter of their king had been sacrificed to an unpopular member of the House of Bonaparte and consequently regarded it as a m√©salliance.Vizetelly, pp. 225‚Äì26. For France's part, Napol√©on Joseph was ill- regarded and had been known to carry on a number of affairs both before and during his marriage. Their official reception into Paris on 4 February was greeted very coldly by Parisians, not out of disrespect for a daughter of the king of Sardinia, but instead out of dislike for her new husband. Indeed, all her life public sympathy tended to lean in her favour; she was fondly regarded as retiring, charitable, pious, and trapped in an unhappy marriage. After Maria Clotilde's father Victor Emmanuel died in 1878, she returned to Turin, Italy without her husband. During this period, Maria Letizia mostly resided with her mother in the Castle of Moncalieri, but her two brothers stayed mainly with their father.Remsen Whitehouse, pp. 313‚Äì314. It was in Italy that their mother withdrew herself from society to dedicate herself to religion and various charities. As a result of her mother's religious devotion, Maria Letizia was raised in a convent-like atmosphere. =Suitors= By her late teens, Maria Letizia was considered by some contemporaries to be beautiful and to be in appearance a \\"real Bonaparte\\". She was said to have resembled some of the sisters of Napoleon Bonaparte, who were considered quite beautiful in their day. In Florence, Maria Letizia met and almost married her cousin Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy. A change of plans occurred however, and the marriage never took place. Emanuele later married Princess H√©l√®ne of Orl√©ans instead. In 1886, a rumour circulated that Maria Letizia was going to marry her cousin Prince Roland Bonaparte. He was thirty years old and recently widowed. Nothing ever came of these rumors however. Marriage Prince Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Aosta during his time as King of Spain. =Engagement= It was in Moncalieri that she met Emanuele's father Amadeus, Duke of Aosta (sometimes referred to as Amadeo). He was her maternal uncle and was formerly the elected king of Spain for a brief period of three years (1870‚Äì1873). Maria Letizia was considered very charming, and Amadeus was very dependent on her society when he visited Italy. In 1888, she agreed to marry him. One source attributes the marriage to the fact that Amadeus felt great love for his niece, but states that Maria Letizia's decision was simply a \\"strong desire for independence on the part of the Princess because of the heaviness of the maternal yoke\\". In preparation for the marriage, she received a great number of notable gifts from personages such as Empress Eugenie, the widowed wife of Napoleon III, and Amadeus' three sons. Eugenie sent her some \\"great and illustrious\\" family jewels, while the boys gave her a necklace with seven rows of pearls that was valued at sixty-thousand dollars. The couple planned to marry in Turin with the hopes of turning the city into a \\"brilliant centre of attraction in Italy\\". =Cause for scandal= The announcement of their marriage caused a great scandal in the Italian court, as he was not only twenty-two years older, but was also her mother's brother. Nevertheless, later that year the necessary Papal dispensation was obtained, giving them permission to marry. Although the Pope gave them permission, the consanguinity of their marriage, along with those of other royal houses would later lead in 1902 to Pope Leo XIII declaring that no more dispensations would be given for these types of marriages. =Wedding= They wedded that same year, on 11 September 1888 at the Royal Palace of Turin in Turin, Italy. The ceremony was performed by the Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Gaetano Alimonda, who had been the man responsible for traveling to Rome for their dispensation. Their wedding was attended by many members of the houses of Bonaparte and Savoy, including Queen Maria Pia of Portugal, who was Amadeus' sister and Maria Letizia's maternal aunt.Remsen Whitehouse, p. 314. Maria Letizia was Amadeus' second wife, as his first spouse Maria Vittoria del Pozzo della Cisterna had died in 1876. Due to the large age difference, Maria Letizia was only three years older than Amadeus' eldest child. The wedding was notable for being the first marriage between a Bonaparte and a member of a reigning house of Europe since 1859. As it was the first major event since the fall of the Second French Republic, the marriage was instrumental in bringing considerable attention back to the prospects of the Bonapartes among various members of the press, especially pertaining to the establishment of another possible government. One article stated that at the time of their marriage, a Bonaparte would have had an easy chance of obtaining at least two million votes if a plebiscite were to occur. This likelihood of a Bonaparte resurgence was most likely because there was a certain nostalgia among the French for the days of Maria Letizia's great uncle Napoleon I and even for the more recent rule of her uncle Napoleon III. The couple lived in Turin and had one son: Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi (22 June 1889 ‚Äì 19 October 1918). He died of the Spanish flu during World War I. Maria Letizia became widowed soon after their wedding, as Amadeus died less than two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890. Later life Maria Letizia's only child Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi in an undated photograph. =Relationship with the Italian court= Up to 1902, Umberto and his mother were rarely seen at the Italian court. No images of Umberto were ever distributed, unlike other members of the Italian royal family. His absence sparked many rumors, some implying that he was \\"mentally afflicted\\" or \\"misshapen\\". In later years, he would appear more in the press, disproving all of these theories. Amadeus's first wife had been a wealthy woman; upon her death, she left her vast fortune to him and their three sons. This meant that any wealth Amadeus had accumulated went to his first three children, leaving little to nothing upon his death for Maria Letizia and their son Umberto. They thus remained dependent upon the allowance they received from the Italian crown. This dependency would cause problems later, as Umberto often angered his cousin Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, the head of the House of Savoy. After Umberto committed various misdemeanors and pranks in 1911, he was imprisoned in Moncalieri Castle. He had recently been dismissed from the naval academy in Livorno for what was apparently incorrigible behavior and amorous attentions to some young women in the town. Maria Letizia, worried over what she considered her son's harsh sentence, wrote to Queen Helena and asked her to intercede for her son. The King remained adamant, however, and only reduced the sentence slightly due to the recent death of his aunt Princess Maria Clotilde, Maria Letizia's mother. =Death and inheritance= During her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior and later husband to the opera singer Vina Bovy. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.

Burt (born February 3, 1947) is an American businessman and diplomat who served as United States Ambassador to Germany and was a chief negotiator of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Prior to his diplomatic career, Burt worked as director of a non-governmental organization and from 1977 to 1980 was a national security correspondent for The New York Times. Early life and education Burt was born on February 3, 1947 in Sewell, Chile. He attended Cornell University, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi.) He earned his bachelor's degree, and earned a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1971. Following graduate school, he was selected for a research fellowship at the United States Naval War College. Following this fellowship, Burt moved to London to work as a research associate and later Assistant Director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies. In 1977, he was hired by The New York Times to work as a correspondent on national security issues. Career Richard Burt (left) with Franz Josef Strau√ü Burt began working for the United States Department of State in the early 1980s. In 1981, he was appointed Director of Politico-Military Affairs, and in 1983 Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs. In 1985, he became the United States Ambassador to Germany. He assisted in the 11 February 1986 exchange of 9 persons including Anatoly Shcharansky and Hana and Karl Koecher across the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin. His tenure as Ambassador to Germany coincided with the beginning of the process that would lead to the reunification of Germany. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush appointed Burt as chief negotiator for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the rank of ambassador. The treaty, signed in 1991, limited the number of nuclear weapons that the two countries could have. After negotiation of the START I treaty, Burt left government service and entered the private sector. He served as John McCain's top national security adviser during McCain's 2000 and 2008 Presidential campaigns. =Founded Diligence= In 2000, he, Lord Powell of Bayswater and others founded the Washington, D.C.,-based private intelligence and risk- assessment and management firm Diligence with Diligence Europe headed by Michael Howard. While he chaired Diligence, Nathaniel Rothschild, a close friend of Oleg Deripaska, purchased a large stake in Diligence. While Deripaska was banned from entering the United State from 1998-2010, he hired Diligence for corporate intelligence gathering, visa lobbying through its considerable GOP connections and, crucially, helping to obtain a $150 million World Bank/European Bank for Reconstruction and Development loan for the Komi Aluminum Project at Sosnogorsk, Komi Republic, a Deripaska subsidiary of Rusal. Through the support from Diligence, Deripaska received a multiple entry visa to the United States in December 2005. From the spring to October of 2005, Diligence performed Project Yucca for BGR in which the auditing firm KPMG was infiltrated by Diligence in order to obtain KPMG's audit of the Jeffrey Galmond and Leonid Reiman associated firm IPOC International Growth Fund for the benefit of Alfa Group's telecom subsidiary Altimo. During Project Yucca, the shareholders of Diligence were CEO Nick Day who was a former British agent, the Chairman of Diligence Richard Burt, the Exxel Group which is a Buenos Aires private equity firm, and Edward Mathias from The Carlyle Group which is a private equity company from Washington D.C. The Bermuda government had accused the IPOC International Growth Fund, which is a Bermuda registered owner of Russian telecoms, of money laundering and also accused Diligence of impersonating secret service personnel. KPMG successfully sued Diligence for fraud and unjust enrichment and received a settlement of $1.7 million from Diligence on June 20, 2006. =After Diligence= In 2007, he left Diligence to work with Henry Kissinger's consulting firm, Kissinger McLarty Associates. He has also worked as a partner in consulting firms McKinsey and Company and now serves as a managing partner of McLarty Associates in Washington, D.C. In addition, he has served on boards for the Atlantic Council, Deutsche Bank's Scudder and Germany mutual fund families, America Abroad Media, International Games Technology, UBS mutual funds, a member of the senior advisory board of Alfa Bank in Moscow until November 2016, an advisor to European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) North America‚Äôs board until November 2016, and Textron Corporation.

During the first two quarters of 2016, McLarty Associates received $365,000 to lobby for New European Pipeline AG, a firm owned by Russian oil company Gazprom. Beginning in February 2016, he and a colleague represented the five European energy companies investing in Nord Stream II, an expansion of the Nord Stream pipeline which would allow Russian gas to reach Europe without going through Belarus or Ukraine. =Supported Donald Trump for President= He contributed to Trump's first major foreign policy speech, April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel. In the speech, Trump called for greater cooperation with Russia and encouraged Trump to take a less interventionist approach to foreign affairs.

Abrams, 544 U.S. 113 (2005), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Telecommunications Act (TCA) precluded damages under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983. because it provided a comprehensive remedial scheme. Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams is a part of the Sea Clammers Doctrine line of cases.See .  Background  Mark Abrams owned property in a residential neighborhood in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. His property was located at a high elevation, near the peak of the Rancho Palos Verdes Peninsula, which was ideal for radio transmissions. In 1989, Abrams obtained a permit to construct a 52.5 foot antenna on his property for amateur radio (\\"ham radio\\") use. In 1998, Abrams sought permission to construct a second antenna tower, but in the course of investigating the application the city learned Abrams was using his antennas for commercial purposes. This was in violation of a city ordinance requiring a conditional use permit for commercial antenna use. In July 1999, Abrams sought the requisite conditional use permit, but his neighbors provided strong opposition. In August 2000, Abrams filled action against Rancho Palos Verdes in the District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the denial of the conditional use permit violated the limitations placed on the city's zoning authority by the Telecommunications Act. Abrams sought injunctive relief under the Telecommunications Act and money damages and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 and 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1988.. The district court ordered the city to grant Abram's application for a conditional use permit, but refused the request for money damages and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point, and remanded for determination of money damages and attorney's fees.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Scalia writing for the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision. Scalia held that the provision of an express, private means of redress in the Telecommunications Act is an indication that Congress intended to preclude more expansive remedies under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983. The existence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations is the dividing line between cases where an action would lie under ¬ß 1983 and those in which it would not..

ATTS is a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000-mile-long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida and the American Discovery Trail, a trail system stretching from the Delaware coast to San Francisco. Description The system includes several hiker-biker trails, primarily: the Northeast Branch Trail, the Northwest Branch Trail, and the Paint Branch Trail; all of which are in Prince George's County. The trail system also includes the Sligo Creek Trail, which extends 8.85 miles (14.24 km) and crosses Prince George's County and Montgomery County. The majority of the routes consist of protected stream valley parks established by M-NCPPC in the 1930s. The trail system converges on a zero milepost in Hyattsville in an area known as Port Towns, named after the former deepwater port of Bladensburg at the head of the Anacostia River, where the various tributaries converge. A trail along the Anacostia connects the system to Washington, DC near the New York Avenue bridge where it continues as the Anacostia River Trail. And a trail connector from the West Hyattsville Metro Station will eventually connect it with DC's Metropolitan Branch Trail at Fort Totten. The trail system also constitutes part of the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail, with which it connects. The area covered by the trails corresponds with the coastal plain section of the Anacostia watershed, which consists of wide floodplains that were reserved for parkland and flood-control by the Army Corps of Engineers, using a system of levees and concrete embankments upon which the trails were initially built. In conjunction with the restoration of natural habitat along the adjoining stream valleys in the 1990s, M-NCPPC and Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation connected and upgraded the stream valley trails into a consistent network of approximately 24 miles (39 km) of paved off-road paths. Northwest Branch Trail Northwest Branch Trail in Silver Spring, MD 7 miles (11 km) of trail located between Hyattsville and Adelphi near New Hampshire Avenue and the Capital Beltway. The paved trail terminates at the southern terminus of the Rachel Carson Environmental Area just south of the Beltway near Adelphi Mill. The Rachel Carson Greenway extends the Northwest Branch Trail into northern Montgomery County as an unimproved hiking trail, connecting to Wheaton Regional Park. =Sligo Creek Trail= of trail located predominately in Montgomery County, ending in Wheaton in the vicinity of Wheaton Regional Park. The Sligo Creek trail originates at the Northwest Branch Trail at Chillum Community Park, Hyattsville, approximately 2.2 miles west of the zero milepost. The section of trail through Takoma Park was connected to the rest of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System in the late 1990s, as part of a storm sewer reclamation project by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. This section was aligned to follow the path of the storm drain through the narrow valley in the vicinity of the Fall Line. =Metropolitan Branch trail connector= A connecting trail has been proposed to connect the Anacostia Tributary Trails system to the Metropolitan Branch rail-trail in Washington, to connect several long-distance hiker-biker trails as part of a series of coast-to-coast greenways. The connection would terminate at the Northwest Branch Trail in the vicinity of the West Hyattsville Metro station, approximately 1.8 miles west of the zero milepost, and would parallel the Green Line (Washington Metro) into D.C. Northeast Branch Trail 2.5 miles (4 km) of trail located predominately along the levee of the Northeast Branch of the Anacostia River in Riverdale, immediately north of the zero milepost, connecting to Greenbelt Park and the College Park Metro station. The first 1.5 miles of the Northeast Branch from Old Riverdale Road to Calvert Road in Riverdale opened in 1977 and was originally named the Denis Wolf Trail by M-NCPPC. It was named for Wolf, a cyclist killed by a drunk driver in 1974, after Wolf's family raised $3,000 for the trail. Eventually, the trail was absorbed into the Northeast Branch Trail, but a Denis Wolf Rest Stop, built in the 1980s still exists just south of Campus Drive. =Indian Creek Trail= 1 mile (1.8 km) of trail constructed around Lake Artemesia in the vicinity of Greenbelt. The Northeast Branch Trail terminates at the zero milepost of the Paint Branch Trail, where this trail and several other trails split off towards Greenbelt Park. Lake Artemesia Park and the trails around it opened on July 23, 1992. Sand, soil and gravel were needed to construct Metro's Green Line and those materials were taken from the land the park sits on now, with the removal creating the basin for the lakes. =Paint Branch Trail= The portion of trail connected to the ATTS consists of of signed trail between the College Park Airport and Museum and Cherry Hill Road in College Park. =Little Paint Branch Trail= In 2018-19, the MNCPPC extended the Little Paint Branch Trail 2.1 miles from its terminus at the Beltsville Community Center to Cherry Hill Road where it connected to the Paint Branch Trail becoming an extension of the ATTS. Anacostia River Trail 3.1 miles (1.8 km) of trail located on the edge of Washington along the head of the Anacostia. The trail starts at Colmar Manor, immediately south of the zero milepost and splits in two at the trail bridge over the Anacostia to Bladensburg Waterfront Park. The west side trail ends at Dueling Creek, short of the Washington line and the east side trail ends at the District boundary just north of the New York Avenue Bridge where it continues as DC's Anacostia River Trail. In 2005, the trail bridge linking Bladensburg and Colmar Manor was completed. In November of 2011, the 1.5 mile section of the west side trail from the waterfront park to an unnamed tributary just north of the District boundary, built in part as environmental mitigation for the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge, was opened. The trail was completed to the boundary in 2016 as part of a stimulus project and opened on Halloween of that year. A separate system of trails in the upper Paint Branch watershed has been constructed in the Montgomery County portion of Paint Branch Park. The two trail systems are separated by the fall line and the Beltway.

The film is a personal account of the two years Mason spent shooting his first film on wolves, Death of a Legend, incorporating footage from the earlier film. Cry of the Wild was shot in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Canadian Arctic, as well as near Mason's home in the Gatineau Hills, where he kept and observed three grown wolves and, eventually, a litter of cubs. Release Produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) for $74,871, Cry of the Wild was launched in over 500 theatres in the United States, grossed over one million dollars in its opening week, generating a reported $4.5 million to $5+ million in gross box office. The feature documentary was initially planned to be released in Canada on a small scale. At a showing in Edmonton, the NFB was approached by an American distributor interested in releasing it in the USA. The company bought the North American rights and released it in New York City, renting out theatres and showing the film on a continuous basis in a formula known as \\"four-walling.\\" In this way, Cry of the Wild grossed $1.8 million in New York City alone. The film was released subsequently all over the U.S. and throughout Canada. However, the release was not without problems. According to Gary Evans in his book In the National Interest: A Chronicle of the National Film Board of Canada from 1949 to 1989, the NFB only recouped several hundred thousand dollars because of a contract that allowed the American distributor to pocket the bulk of the proceeds and declare bankruptcy. Mason completed his third and final film on wolves, Wolf Pack, in 1974.

The film makes great use of its locations and is well photographed - the widescreen compositions are frequently impressive, and the movie zips along at a good pace, but it's not the most original western ever made in terms of story or character development. That said, there's enough action and intrigue here to keep most fans happy and, as mentioned, Williamson makes the most of his leading man status in this picture. Brenda Venus is also pretty captivating here, the camera loves her and you can't really blame it. She's alluring enough that you can certainly understand Sam's desire to get her back.

Following Locke's emphasis on the importance of concrete language over abstract, the Edgeworth's argued that words should clearly indicate \\"distinct ideas\\".

Ireland and France are shown as linked through their revolutionary fervor. In 1798, France had sent aid to the United Irishmen and this tie is hinted at through Ormond's travels.

The novel was written in response to a letter from a Jewish- American reader who complained about Edgeworth's stereotypically anti-semitic portrayals of Jews in Castle Rackrent (1800), Belinda (1801), The Absentee (1812), and her Moral Tales (1801) for children.Manly, 7. The novel is an autobiography of a \\"recovering anti-Semite\\", whose youthful prejudices are undone by contact with various Jewish characters, particularly a young woman. It also makes parallels between the religious discrimination of the Jews and the Catholics in Ireland. Set between the Jewish Naturalization Act of 1753 and the Gordon Riots of 1780, the timeframe highlights these connections.Manly, 12. Synopsis Harrington follows the protagonist of the same name who explores his memories to better understand his views on Jews. The novel begins with Harrington's early image of Jews, formed by stories told by his maid of Simon the Jew. Harrington says that the stories of Simon the Jew were \\" used upon every occasion to reduce me to passive obedience.\\"Edgeworth, Maria. Harrington. London: Baldwin and Cradock, 1833. p.3 His parents further strengthen this image by rewarding Harrington's antisemitism. Only after attending public school and meeting the bully Mowbray are Harrington's views on Jews changed. Mowbray's tormenting of the Jewish peddler Jacob causes this sudden shift in thinking. The story shifts to a romance novel with the introduction of Berenice Montenero, an American Jew who moved to England with her wealthy father. Harrington's family and friends are alarmed at his choice of a Jewish woman, a relationship further impeded by the advances of Harrington's old rival Mowbray. Seeking marriage into a wealthy family, Mowbray's attempts to court Berenice are denied. As revenge, Mowbray brings charges of insanity against Harrington, a situation further compounded by his family threatening to disown him. To marry Berenice, Harrington must overcome these obstacles and prove himself to Mr. Montenero. He is thus tested \\"by experiences designed to arouse his enthusiasm and fear.\\"Harden, Elizabeth. Maria Edgeworth Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984. p.92 Mowbray is exposed as the culprit behind Harrington's supposed insanity and Harrington is deemed worthy of marriage to Berenice. This strange courtship is concluded with the revelation by Mr. Montenero, \\"I have tried you to the utmost, and am satisfied both of the steadiness of your principles and of the strength of your attachment to my daughter-Berenice is not a Jewess.\\"Edgeworth, Maria.

It was closed in 1955. The building sat on Culton Street in Warrensburg, Missouri. The school was officially entered in the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 2002. History The Howard School had its beginning in 1867, when Cynthia Ann Reed Briggs and the Rev. M. Henry Smith from the American Missionary Association purchased a Lot 14 in Rentch's Addition in Warrensburg for the sum of $100.23. Funding for this lot and subsequent school building was accomplished with African American assistance alone. The new one-room, 32'x24' frame building cost $1,001.90 and when half-completed, accepted assistance from the Freedmen's Bureau in the amount of $800 to finish the structure. Grateful for the assistance, the school's sponsors decided to call it Howard School, in honor of General Oliver O. Howard, Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. The Howard School was the newly established Warrensburg School District's first school building, opening in August, 1867. Rev. M. Henry Smith was named by the School Board to take charge of the city's black schools and served as principal and teacher in the school. In 1871, Smith resigned his post to become the first President of Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri's first African American institution of higher learning. (includes 10 photographs from 2000-2001) The current building came into existence as a result of the success of the first Howard School. Attendance grew from an average daily attendance of 45 black students in 1867 to well over 100 students by 1870. After renting space in several buildings on the west side of town to help accommodate the exploding black student population, and prodding from the black community and a few vocal citizens, the Board of Education, on May 21, 1888, approved plans for the construction of a new school building consisting of three rooms, each the size of the first school building (32'x24'), to provide for the educational needs of Warrensburg's black school children. The cost to the district was $1605. As more students successfully completed instruction in lower grades, demands for more advanced coursework increased. Two years of high school courses were added initially. In 1929, the eleventh grade was added, followed by the twelfth grade a little later. In May 1932, Lillian Inez Visor became the first student to receive a diploma for the four-year high school program. When the State Department of Education adopted new requirements for the accreditation and classification of school in 1948, Howard School could not meet the new higher standards. After failing twice to secure approval for a bond issue that would have upgraded the Howard School, The Warrensburg School Board voted to discontinue the school's high school program. They agreed to transport any qualified African-American high school student to CC Hubbard High School located 28 miles to the east in Sedalia. The school continued solely as a grade school until its closing in 1955 as a result of the integration of schools in America. Restoration The Howard School Preservation Association has developed a mission statement, filed Articles of Incorporation with the state of Missouri, and has been designated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt not-for-profit organization by the IRS (September 16, 2003). In addition, an Assessment and Feasibility Study was completed in July 2004 which provides a preservation plan that includes an analysis of the building and recommendations for restoration as well as long term maintenance. The Howard School Preservation Association was officially deeded the property on which the Howard School building is located on December 22, 2004. The Howard School building roof collapsed in the summer of 2014, and the building was subsequently demolished in 2015.

History St-Viateur Bagel was established on May 21, 1957 by Myer Lewkowicz, a Holocaust survivor who moved to Canada in 1953. Lewkowicz spoke of his experience in the Holocaust influencing the opening the shop by stating \\"At Buchenwald, all I dreamt of was a piece of bread\\". He also learned the trade as an employee of Montreal Bagel Bakery, another bagel shop owned by Hyman Seligman. Named after the street it is located on, St-Viateur Street, and one of the longest-running bagel shops in Montreal. In 1985 the bagel shop suffered an extensive fire, yet the woodstove remained entirely intact. St-Viateur Bagel has two bakeries, five bagel cafes, a food truck, the original shop and an online store. Today, the bakery is owned by Joe Morena, who worked at the shop for 15 years, and competes with the nearby Fairmount Bagel for the title of Montreal's best bagel. In 2017, St-Viateur Bagel celebrates 60 years of baking.  Cultural significance  left St-Viateur Bagel Shop lies on the border of the Jewish Quarter and the Mile End neighborhood. In addition to St-Viateur Bagel Shop, Montreal's Jewish Quarter is also the home of Schwartz's deli, Moishes Steakhouse, Cheskie's Bakery, and Beauty's Luncheonette. All of these establishments have a large presence in the Jewish community in Montreal. A study done by Universit√© de Montr√©al explains that the large influence of Jewish food in Montreal culinary culture is likely because of how inexpensive and widely accessible items such as bagels and smoked meat were in Montreal in the early 20th century. This is because there was a large Jewish immigrant population which put down roots along Boulevard St. Laurent. Professor of Theology, Oliver Bauer of Universit√© de Montr√©al, explains in the study that the roundness of a bagel represents infinity and immortality. It is because of this representation that bagels are often served at a bris ceremonies‚Äîthe celebration of a baby boy's circumcision‚Äîand at shiva gatherings‚Äîthe house of mourning after a death has occurred.  Bagel-making process  After the dough is made, small pieces are cut and are formed into the bagel shape Since the shop opened in 1957, their process of producing the bagels has stayed true to the original recipe. According to the staff and owner Joe Morena, each bagel is hand rolled individually, boiled in honey water for 30‚Äì60 seconds, dipped in seeds, and baked on a long wooden plank in a wood-burning oven. In contrast to the New York-style bagel which contains similar ingredients, the Montreal bagel differs in size, taste, and style. The Montreal bagel tends to be sweeter, thinner, and has a larger hole. The authentic wood-burning oven creates the crispy texture that Montreal bagel lovers appreciate left =Bagels= St- Viateur sells several varieties of Montr√©al-style bagels including: plain, sesame, poppy, all dressed, whole wheat, cinnamon & raisin, rosemary & seasalt, multigrain, and flax. As well, the website provides nutritional information on each bagel including ingredients and allergens. Each bagel ranges between 200 and 240 calories per 2 servings (1 serving is listed as one half of a bagel). An order of two dozen bagels is priced between $9 and $12 CAD. Services In addition to in store and delivery service, St-Viateur offers a catering service with 24 hours' notice. The catering menu includes various options such as smoked salmon platters, cheese platters, and salads. Additionally, a St-Viateur food truck operates exclusively throughout the spring into the fall. The truck is available for bookings for private and corporate events. The shop also offers branded merchandise including T-shirts, tote bags, aprons, pins, key chains, and bread knife. The merchandise is emblazoned with their signature bagel logo. St-Viateur ships bagels nationawide and all over North America. In the media The closing of the Monkland Village location of St-Viateur has been widely reported on across Montreal news outlets. In 2019, Christopher Curtis from the Montreal Gazette wrote an article on the permanent closing of the St-Viateur location on Monkland Avenue. The location is reported to close in March 2019 due to a problem re-negotiating the lease with D√©veloppement M√©tro Montreal Corporation. CTV Montreal also discussed its closing and the disappointment of its customers. In 2018, the Globe and Mail published a article detailing how wood-burning businesses that are unable to meet emission by-law requirements will be forced to switch to gas or electric. The article cited St-Viateur among other traditional bagels shops which will be directly impacted by this development.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta sitting with the governing Progressive Conservative party from 1971 to 1986. During his time in office he served numerous ministerial portfolio's in the Executive Council of Alberta. Early life Horst A. Schmid was born in Munich, Germany. He emigrated to Canada, moving up to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to work as a miner in 1952. He moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 1956. After arriving from the North, Schmid took numerous courses from the University of Toronto in Business Administration, Business Finance, and Business Psychology. In the late 1960s, Schmid ran a restaurant in Edmonton called the Hofbr√§uhaus, after the original in Munich. At that time, he also founded a Bavarian folk dance Schuhplattler group, the Bavarian Schuhplattlers of Edmonton, still active today. From 1956 to 1966, Schmid was the volunteer host of a weekly Sunday radio program on Radio CKUA Edmonton called \`\`Music and News from the German- Speaking Countries of Europe\`\` (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p.64). This program also informed the listeners about their new home in Canada. Political career = Minister of Culture, Youth and Recreation 1971‚Äì1975 = Schmid ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1971 Alberta general election. The contest in the new electoral district of Edmonton-Avonmore ended up being a close two way race between Schmid and incumbent Social Credit MLA Gerrit Radstaak. Two other candidates rounded out the field. He won the hotly contested race in to pick up the seat for the Progressive Conservatives. His win helped that party form government after the election, one of only four times that power has shifted hands in Alberta's history. Schmid became the first Canadian post World War II immigrant elected to a legislature in Canada and to be appointed a Cabinet Minister in Canada. Schmid was described by Dr. David S.R. Leighton, O.C., as \`\`the dynamic German-born immigrant who became a hard-driving Minister of Culture, who had the job of implementing the government's arts strategy and did so with a vengeance\`\` (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p. 7). As Minister, Schmid initiated and guided the development of countless programs in his portfolio. These included funding new cultural support programs, grants to support arts organizations, libraries and cultural heritage sites and groups across Alberta (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p. 70). The Cultural Development Branch generously supported visual arts, performing arts, film and literary arts. The Cultural Heritage Division of Schmid's department provided the guidelines for the support of heritage projects. In 1974, Schmid organized the Arts and You Festival, the first provincial Conference of the Arts in Red Deer attended by 1000 community members and artists [( ibid.)]. = Minister of Government Services and Minister of Culture 1975‚Äì1979 = Schmid would run for a second term in the 1975 Alberta general election. He and Raadstack would face each other for the second time. With incumbent ministerial advantage Schmid saw a significant gain in his popular vote while the opposition candidates collapsed. He was returned to his second term easily. Premier Lougheed appointed Schmid as the Minister of Government Services and the Minister of Culture. During this appointment, Schmid initiated the following: Foundation for the Performing Arts, Cultural Heritage Foundation, Historical Resources Foundation, acquisition and development of the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village, First National Conference of Ministers Responsible for Culture and the First National conference of Ministers Responsible for Recreation {(fact)}. Schmid was part of the team that brought the 1978 Commonwealth Games to Edmonton. Schmid added the Commonwealth Games Arts Festival and Film Festival to the Commonwealth Games, still part of the Games to this day (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p 168). The most important cultural assistance initiated at this time was the Alberta Matching Grants Program where private donations to arts organizations were matched by the provincial government up to twenty-five percent of their budget. This has led to increased private sector donations in support of arts organizations (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p224). = Minister of State for Economic Development and International Trade 1979 - 1982 = His bid for a third term would see another significant popular vote increase. Schmid managed the second best popular vote of his career despite seeing some gains by the opposition candidates. He easily won his third term in office. After the election Lougheed appointed Schmid as Minister of State for Economic Development - International Trade. Schmid spearheaded the promotion of exporting manufactured goods and services to other countries through numerous trade missions. Schmid was also invited as guest speaker to many national and international conferences and meetings of the Oil and Gas Industry . Schmid supported Mel Hurtig in his proposal to produce a Canadian Encyclopedia since 1975 which resulted in government funding of Mel Hurtig's The Canadian Encyclopedia as part of the celebration for Alberta's 75th Anniversary (Fraser, Alberta's Camelot,2003, p 117). Schmid was responsible for the return of a medicine bundle that had been housed in the Provincial Museum back to the Blood Reserve for use in their sacred Sun Dance ceremony.(Fraser, Alberta's Camelot, 2003, p76) = Minister of International Trade 1982‚Äì1985 = Schmid ran for his fourth term in office in the 1982 Alberta general election. He won the highest popular vote of his career. His margin of victory however was reduced as NDP candidate Kathy Wright heavily challenged Schmid to retain his seat. Lougheed appointed Schmid to be the Minister of International Trade. He served that portfolio until November 1985 when Don Getty who became the new premier that year appointed him Minister of Tourism. Schmid led very successful International Trade Missions as Minister of International Trade resulting in large signed contracts for Alberta companies. {(fact)} = Minister of Tourism 1985‚Äì1986 = As Minister, Schmid was responsible for promoting Alberta Tourism internationally, especially in Europe. = Commissioner General for Trade and Tourism 1986‚Äì1995 = In 1986, Schmid was appointed Commissioner General for Trade and Tourism for the Government of Alberta. He was responsible for the promotion of tourism to Alberta, especially from Europe. He again took numerous Alberta companies especially from the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services sector internationally, often to many as 40 countries in a year. These were highly successful trade missions. In cooperation with the airlines, international journalists were brought to Alberta to write about Alberta in their European publications. Schmid was able to convince travel companies especially to bring thousands of skiers to Alberta ski resorts. Schmid continued in this position for nine years . Since retiring from Public Office in 1995, Schmid has returned to his international trade business as President and CEO of Flying Eagle Resources. He continues as Chairman, CEO and/or Director of other Alberta companies . In 1998, Schmid was appointed to the Patrons Council of the Heritage Community Foundation. In 2005, he was appointed one of the Centennial Ambassadors of the Province of Alberta.

He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for the Australian cricket team against the South Africa cricket team in New Zealand at the age of 20 on 15 February 1995. The eldest of three children, Ponting emulated the feats of his father, playing cricket in summer and Australian rules football in winter, before breaking his arm while playing the latter sport for a junior North Launceston Football Club team as a 14-year-old. He was educated in the Tasmanian state school system, studying at Mowbray Heights Primary and Brooks High School. Ponting received a bat sponsorship with Kookaburra Sport at 14, before being acclaimed the best 17-year-old batsman that Australian Cricket Academy coach Rod Marsh had ever seen. At 17 years and 337 days, Ponting made his first-class cricket debut for Tasmania, breaking David Boon's record as the youngest player to represent the state. Later in the season, he became the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. Further into the 1992‚Äì93 season, Ponting scored two centuries in a match against Western Australia‚Äîthe youngest player in Sheffield Shield history to do so. He played non-international games against national teams for Australia A in the 1994‚Äì95 World Series Cup, before making his Australian debut. Birth Born in Launceston, Tasmania, on 19 December 1974, Ricky Thomas Ponting is the eldest of Graeme and Lorraine Ponting's three children.Richardson (2002), pp. 18‚Äì20. His brother Drew is two years younger, while sister Renee was born when Ponting was six. Their uncle Greg Campbell played cricket for Australia in 1989 and 1990.Richardson (2002), p. 20. Graeme was \\"a good club cricketer\\"Richardson (2002), p. 18. and played Australian rules, while Lorraine was a state vigoro champion. \\"Fiercely contested\\" in the 1950s and 1960s, vigoro is a mix between cricket and baseball, primarily played in the Australian states of Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. Ponting's parents first lived in Prospect south of the city centre, before moving into the working-class area of Newnham, north of central Launceston. The suburb is near York Park, Tasmania's largest capacity stadium. Residents of the area were generally known as \\"swampies\\" because the land was previously swamp on the banks of the Tamar River.Richardson (2002), p. 19.  Junior ranks  Introduced to cricket by father Graeme and uncle Greg, Ponting was able to play for the Mowbray Under‚Äì13s team at the age of 11 in 1985‚Äì86. In January 1986, he took part in the five-day annual Northern Tasmania junior cricket competition.Richardson (2002), p. 21. On the Monday, he struggled to trouble the scorers, however, he bounced back with a century on Tuesday. Wednesday saw him make 117 not out and he continued his form into Thursday and Friday, scoring centuries on both days.Richardson (2002), pp. 21‚Äì22. Afterwards, bat manufacturer Kookaburra gave Ponting a sponsorship contract when he was still only 14 years old. Ponting took this form into the Under-16s week-long competition less than a month later, scoring an even century on the final day.Richardson (2002), p. 22. Ted Richardson, the former head of the Northern Tasmanian Schools Cricket Association said: \\"Ricky is certainly the equal of David Boon at this level. At his age he's the best I've seen in the north. His technique, application, and temperament are all excellent and he has the modesty he will need to progress further.\\" Australian Rules football was also a big part of Ponting's sporting life; during winter he played junior football for North Launceston and until he was 14, it could have become a possible sporting option, before he broke the humerus in his right arm playing for North Launceston Under‚Äì17s. Ponting's arm was so badly damaged that it had to be pinned.Ponting and Staples (1998), p. 12. Told to endure a 14-week lay- off, he never played competitive football again.Richardson (2002), p. 24. He later wrote: \\"At one stage I was concerned that the arm injury might also stop me from playing cricket but they [the doctors] did a pretty good job on pinning the bones‚Äîand it hasn't bothered me since.\\"Ponting and Staples (1998), p. 13. In 1986, Ponting said: \\"I'd love to play for Australia [...] I look up to David Boon because he's from here [Launceston].\\"Richardson (2002), p. 25. During Tasmanian Sheffield Shield matches at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground (NTCA Ground), Ponting served as a scoreboard assistant, thereby surrounding himself with first-class and international cricketers.Ponting and Staples (1998), pp. 10‚Äì11. After leaving school at the end of year 10 as a 16-year-old in 1990, he began work as a groundsman at Scotch Oakburn College, a private school in Launceston. In 1991, the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association sponsored Ponting so that he could attend a fortnight's training at the Australian Institute of Sport's Cricket Academy in Adelaide.Richardson (2002), p. 26. The two weeks turned into a full two-year scholarship as he was acclaimed to be the best 17-year-old batsman Academy coach Rod Marsh had ever seen.Richardson (2002), p. 27. Playing five games for Tasmania in the 1992 Under‚Äì19 tournament in Perth, Ponting scored 350 runs, earning him selection in the 13-man national Under‚Äì19 development squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa‚Äîthe first Australian cricket team to make an official tour to the country since Bill Lawry's team in 1970; South Africa were banned from international sport soon after because of their government's policy of apartheid, and were not readmitted until the 1990s.Ponting and Staples (1998), pp. 30‚Äì31. Under the captaincy of Adam Gilchrist, the Australians played four one-day and four three-day games, winning five and drawing three. Ponting scored 430 runs at an average of 45.67.Richardson (2002), p. 28.Ponting and Staples (1998), p. 35. Later recalling the excitement of the experience, Ponting wrote: Early Australian domestic career After scoring 114 not out in a club match against Riverside, Ponting became the youngest player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days.Richardson (2002), pp. 30‚Äì31. In November 1992, at the age of 17 years and 337 days, he batted at number four in the order against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.Richardson (2002), p. 31. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania's second innings.Richardson (2002), p. 32. In his first match in Tasmania‚Äîthis time against New South Wales‚ÄîPonting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw, before scoring 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. At the end of the first day's play, Tasmania were 6/200,This notation means that six wickets were lost in the process of scoring 200 runs and Ponting was the only player to resist, reaching 98 not out. He eventually reached three figures the next morning, having endured three rain breaks and 54 minutes in the nineties. The century made him the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century, at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. The next day he spoke about the achievement: \\"I knew I had to be patient and wait for it to come [...] I wasn't that nervous last night, but I was a bit nervous this morning.\\"Richardson (2002), p. 33. Dismissed for 125 out of a total of 298, Ponting scored 17 boundaries in his five-and-a-half-hour stay at the crease. Coach Greg Shipperd was impressed in what he saw: \\"It was an excellent innings, one of classical stroke play. The way he freely put together a good, solid innings, showed that his potential is being realised. It was an indication, for him, of what it's like to go the extra step.\\" These performances lead Ponting to his List A debut on 13 December against Victoria in Devonport. He struggled, however, scoring 22 from 45 balls in Tasmania's defeat. His form, nonetheless, remained strong in first-class cricket, scoring another half-century, Ponting scored back-to-back centuries against Western Australia in Perth, the nation's fastest wicket, thus becoming the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score two centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 first-class runs in the season, Ponting finished with 781 runs at 48.81. But his form in List A games were not as strong, aggregating 99 at 33 in four matches. Still, Ponting hit an unbeaten 59 from 52 balls against a touring England A side in Hobart. After the season's end, still aged 18, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70.Richardson (2002), p. 34. Speculation ignited that Ponting was an outsider to be selected for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said \\"At the start of the season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach ‚Äî there are blokes like [South Australian] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: \\"A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve.\\"Richardson (2002), pp. 34‚Äì35. The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.Richardson (2002), p. 35. Before the start of the 1993‚Äì94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. \\"I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't go too far into my head.\\" In Tasmania's final round- robin match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand.Richardson (2002), p. 36. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.Richardson (2002), p. 143. A month after the final, he was again selected for the Academy squad for three limited overs matches against a touring Indian team. Queenslander Stuart Law captained the Australian side that included former Australian keeper Rod Marsh. In Australia's victory in the first match in Canberra, Ponting top-scored with 71, before making 52 in a victory in Sydney. The last match was also successful for the home team, with Ponting not required to bat.Richardson (2002), p. 37. Ponting started his 1994‚Äì95 campaign with a century against eventual Shield champions Queensland in Brisbane, in a performance that impressed Queensland captain Allan Border, who had just retired from international cricket after leading the national team for a decade. Border said of Ponting: \\"He's just an outstanding prospect. The thing I like about him is he's very aggressive, he plays all the shots, he's equally at home on the front foot as the back foot. He cuts and pulls well, and he drives well. You don't often see that, the ability to get on [the] front foot and back foot and play equally well.\\" Speculation once again arose that Ponting could be selected for the upcoming tour to the West Indies. When Tasmania played Western Australia at Bellerive Oval on 4 November 1994, Ponting was 117 not out at stumps. That century was his fifth successive triple-figure score against Western Australia; Sir Donald Bradman is the only other batsman to score five consecutive centuries against another state in Shield history. He continued to 211, sharing a 319-run stand with captain Rod Tucker in the process.Richardson (2002), p. 38. Ten days after the double century, Ponting was named in the Australian XI to play England at Bellerive Oval in a match that was used as practice for fringe Australian players before the upcoming series in the West Indies. Future Australian representatives Matthew Hayden, Langer, Greg Blewett and Martyn were also selected. In a drawn match, Ponting compiled a half-century, but Martyn scored a century.Richardson (2002), p. 40. A fourth team was introduced to the World Series Cup in 1994‚Äì95‚ÄîAustralia A‚Äîfor the only time. The Australian selectors re-shuffled both teams so that some players stepped up from the A team to the main Australian team, and vice versa, during the competition, depending on their performance. The Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of the innovation: \\"... out there, on the field there was an ultra-competitive attitude by blokes of both teams, spurred on by the crows who were barracking for against Australia and supporting the underdog Australia A, who were pepped up and firing. Of course it gave the Australia A guys a chance to break into the Australian team, but to me the focus of the summer was on beating the Poms [England] in the Tests and winning the World Series, not beating our own Australian mates.\\"Richardson (2002), pp. 40‚Äì41. Despite the negative feedback, the concept gave Ponting a chance on the international stage, and he scored 161 runs at 26.83 with one half-century. Two weeks after the World Series, Ponting was selected in the squad for the upcoming one-day tri-series involving South Africa, India and hosts New Zealand. Trent Bouts, a cricket writer for The Australian said: \\"His selection at age 20 would normally represent a bold gamble on youth but so precocious are his talents it amounts to a routine progression.\\"Richardson (2002), pp. 41‚Äì42. Ponting made his ODI debut against South Africa at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on 15 February 1995.Richardson (2002), p. 44.

Lake Columbia was a substantially larger version of the modern-day lake behind the Grand Coulee Dam. Lake Columbia's overflow ‚Äì the diverted Columbia River ‚Äì drained first through Foster Coulee, and as the ice dam grew, through first Moses Coulee, and finally, the Grand Coulee. Glacial Lake Missoula The Cordilleran ice sheet also blocked the Clark Fork River and created Glacial Lake Missoula, rising behind a high ice dam in flooded valleys of western Montana. Over 2000 years the ice dam periodically failed, releasing approximately 40 high-volume Missoula Floods of water down the Columbia River drainage, passing through glacial Lake Columbia. The largest flood is estimated to be the initial flood at 2,500 km3 (600 mi3), with subsequent floods occurring at roughly 20 to 80 year intervals. Since Lake Columbia was impounded behind the Okanogan lobe, which rose to , this lobe effectively blocked the normal course of the Columbia River, blocking the Missoula Floods and diverting water to flow across much of eastern Washington state. The erosion from the floods created the Grand Coulee as well as the Dry Falls, Palouse Falls, and the Channeled Scablands features of eastern Washington state. Flood deposits Flood beds on the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show episodic flood deposits as well as deposit grading and rhythmical repetition. Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled between Missoula floods, annual deposits (varves) can be observed between the Missoula flood deposits, they help to establish the periodicity of these major floods. The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually-deposited varves by both their thickness and the presence of materials foreign to the immediate drainage. Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia, supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures.

It is named for Thomas Phillips, a building contractor and city councillor who bought the land from fur trader Joseph Frobisher.

King Edward VII in Phillips Square. In 1842, the square was first laid out, in what was at the time a wealthy residential area on the fringe of the city of Montreal. The first merchant to open a business on Phillips Square was Alfred Joyce, ‚Äúthe high class caterer and confectioner‚Äù and one-time mayor of the town of Outremont who built an elegant shop on the south side of the square in 1878. In 1891, Morgan's department store established itself on the north side of the square. That site is of particular interest to visitors from the U.S. because Confederate President Jefferson Davis sent his family to live in Montreal during the civil war; a brass plaque installed on the west side of the store, today called The Bay, was dedicated to the memory of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States, who came in 1867 to stay in John Lovell‚Äôs house which then stood on the site. The plaque was removed in 2017. The head office of Henry Birks and Sons was built soon after on the west side of the square in 1894. The fast food outlet on the corner of the east side of Phillips Square is where Montreal‚Äôs first art gallery was opened by Princess Louise and the Marquess of Lorne in 1879. When its collection grew, it eventually moved to the present-day Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. On the south side of the square, where Alfred Joyce once had his pastry shop, is the Canada Cement Building, built in 1921. Designed by Barott and Blackader, the dignified 10-storey building was the first office tower to be built completely of reinforced concrete. Canada Cement was founded by Max Aitken, later Lord Beaverbrook, and Barott convinced him to use concrete in the building of his head office to advertise his cement-based products. The building was considered avant garde when it opened because it was the first skyscraper in Montreal to have an underground parking garage, at a time when there were not so many automobiles on the road. The square was most recently renovated in 1995. On August 31, 2012, a memorial to the victims of the Blue Bird Caf√© fire, which occurred nearby in 1972, was unveiled by the city of Montreal on the south side of the square to mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy. Monuments The square features a bronze monument of King Edward VII, who ruled from 1901 to 1910. He visited Montreal in 1860, when he was still the Prince of Wales, to open the Victoria Bridge. The statue was designed by Louis-Philippe H√©bert and was erected in 1914. The four allegorical figures at the base of the monument represent Peace, the Four Founding Nations, Abundance, and Liberty.

The company was organized by Daniel Buck of Bellefonte, James Hockenberry of East Waterford, and a third partner, named Brown, about 1905. The company built a sawmill, two stave mills, and a lath mill in East Waterford. This town was served by the narrow gauge Tuscarora Valley Railroad, which provided an outlet for finished lumber from the mills. The additional cost of transfer between the Tuscarora Valley and the standard gauge Pennsylvania Railroad forced the lumber company to specialize in finished lumber, rather than lower-margin mine props. To bring timber to the mills, the company planned a logging railroad from a connection with the Tuscarora Valley at East Waterford toward its timberlands. The railroad was incorporated on May 16, 1905 as the East Waterford and Kansas Valley Railroad, and it acquired the rails and Climax locomotive of the Perry Lumber Company, which was then being dismantled. The railroad was built using a narrow gauge, the same as the connecting Tuscarora Valley. The line ran south from the interchange at East Waterford and the mills along Horse Valley Road, following the road through Waterford Gap in Tuscarora Mountain. Past the mountain, it forked, with one branch running up Kansas Valley to the company's lumber camp at Big Knob, and the other running south along Horse Valley. The total length was less than . On April 1, 1907, Brown was bought out by Cummings McNitt, formerly a partner of the logging operation McNitt Bros. & Co. McNitt gradually purchased the interests of Buck and Hockenberry as logging progressed, and was sole owner when the company was wound up after exhaustion of the timber. McNitt entered into partnership with H.C. Hower, the lumber broker who disposed of much of the timber shipped over the Tuscarora Valley Railroad, and they formed the Juniata Lumber Company to log a tract in Maryland. The Climax locomotive was sold to the new company and the railroad was dismantled in 1909. The line up Kansas Valley and a small part of the line in Horse Valley now lies within the boundaries of Tuscarora State Forest.

He moved his political career to the provincial level where he served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta sitting with the governing Progressive Conservative caucus from 1971 to 1986. Political career Diachuk ran for election to the City of Edmonton Separate School Board. He won a seat in the 1962 Edmonton municipal election holding the third and final seat in plurality out of five candidates . He was defeated running for a second term in office in the 1964 Edmonton municipal election finishing eighth out of ten candidates. He attempted a return to the board in the 1966 municipal election this time winning the fifth place seat out of ten candidates. He was re- elected to his third term in the 1968 Edmonton municipal election again winning the fifth place seat out of twelve candidates. Diachuk ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district of Edmonton-Beverly defeating incumbent Social Credit MLA Lou Heard. He also defeated future MLA Barrie Chivers who finished third out of fourth in the race. He vacated his school trustee seat after winning the provincial election. Diachuk ran for re-election in the 1975 Alberta general election. He faced four other candidates and ended up winning a higher plurality and a substantially better margin of victory. He would run for his third term in office in the 1979 Alberta general election. His margin of victory would shrink as he faced a hotly contested challenge from New Democrat candidate Gene Mitchell and two other candidates. After the election Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Diachuk to the provincial cabinet. He became a Minister without Portfolio Responsible for occupational health and safety. Diachuk ran for his fourth term in office in the 1982 Alberta general election. He won a personal record for his highest popular vote. Despite having a ministerial portfolio he was nearly defeated by New Democrat candidate Winston Gereluk. He would keep his portfolio when Don Getty became Premier in November 1985.

Autotrophs do not need a living source of carbon or energy and are the producers in a food chain, such as plants on land or algae in water (in contrast to heterotrophs as consumers of autotrophs or other heterotrophs). Autotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and as stored chemical fuel. Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. Some autotrophs, such as green plants and algae, are phototrophs, meaning that they convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Others, including methanogens, are chemotrophs, which use organic or inorganic chemical compounds as a source of energy. Most chemoautotrophs are lithotrophs, using inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen gas, elemental sulfur, ammonium and ferrous oxide as reducing agents and hydrogen sources for biosynthesis and chemical energy release. Autotrophs use a portion of the ATP produced during photosynthesis or the oxidation of chemical compounds to reduce NADP+ to NADPH to form organic compounds. History The Greek term autotroph was coined by the German botanist Albert Bernhard Frank in 1892. It stems from the ancient Greek word œÑœÅŒøœÜŒÆ (troph·∏ó), meaning \\"nourishment\\" or \\"food\\". The first autotrophic organism developed about 2 billion years ago. Photoautotrophs evolved from heterotrophic bacteria by developing photosynthesis. The earliest photosynthetic bacteria used hydrogen sulphide. Due to the scarcity of hydrogen sulphide, some photosynthetic bacteria evolved to use water in photosynthesis, leading to cyanobacteria. Variants Some organisms rely on organic compounds as a source of carbon, but are able to use light or inorganic compounds as a source of energy. Such organisms are not defined as autotrophic, but rather as heterotrophic. An organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from light is called a photoheterotroph, while an organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds and energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds is termed a chemolithoheterotroph. Evidence suggests that some fungi may also obtain energy from ionizing radiation: Such radiotrophic fungi were found growing inside a reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Flowchart to determine if a species is autotroph, heterotroph, or a subtype Ecology Green fronds of a maidenhair fern, a photoautotroph Autotrophs are fundamental to the food chains of all ecosystems in the world. They take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create fuel molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called primary production. Other organisms, called heterotrophs, take in autotrophs as food to carry out functions necessary for their life. Thus, heterotrophs - all animals, almost all fungi, as well as most bacteria and protozoa - depend on autotrophs, or primary producers, for the raw materials and fuel they need. Heterotrophs obtain energy by breaking down carbohydrates or oxidizing organic molecules (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) obtained in food.Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2015). \\"Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O2\\", J. Chem. Educ. 92: 2094-2099. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 Carnivorous organisms rely on autotrophs indirectly, as the nutrients obtained from their heterotrophic prey come from autotrophs they have consumed. Most ecosystems are supported by the autotrophic primary production of plants and cyanobacteria that capture photons initially released by the sun. Plants can only use a fraction (approximately 1%) of this energy for photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis splits a water molecule (H2O), releasing oxygen (O2) into the atmosphere, and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) to release the hydrogen atoms that fuel the metabolic process of primary production. Plants convert and store the energy of the photon into the chemical bonds of simple sugars during photosynthesis. These plant sugars are polymerized for storage as long- chain carbohydrates, including other sugars, starch, and cellulose; glucose is also used to make fats and proteins. When autotrophs are eaten by heterotrophs, i.e., consumers such as animals, the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins contained in them become energy sources for the heterotrophs. Proteins can be made using nitrates, sulfates, and phosphates in the soil.

The earliest is the alleged plot to invade Tibet by Genghis Khan in 1206,Wylie. p.105 which is considered anachronistic; there is no evidence of Mongol-Tibetan encounters prior to the military campaign in 1240.Wylie. p.106 The first confirmed campaign is the invasion of Tibet by the Mongol general Doorda Darkhan in 1240,Wylie. p.110, 'delegated the command of the Tibetan invasion to an otherwise unknown general, Doorda Darkhan'. a campaign of 30,000 troopsShakabpa. p.61: 'thirty thousand troops, under the command of Leje and Dorta, reached Phanpo, north of Lhasa.'Sanders. p. 309, his grandson Godan Khan invaded Tibet with 30000 men and destroyed several Buddhist monasteries north of Lhasa that resulted in 500 casualties.Wylie. p.104 The campaign was smaller than the full-scale invasions used by the Mongols against large empires. The purpose of this attack is unclear, and is still in debate among Tibetologists.Wylie. p.103 Then in the late 1240s Mongolian prince Godan invited Sakya lama Sakya Pandita, who urged other leading Tibetan figures to submit to Mongol authority.Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions, by Anne-Marie Blondeau and Katia Buffetrille, p13 This is generally considered to have marked the beginning of Mongol rule over Tibet, as well as the establishment of patron and priest relationship between Mongols and Tibetans. These relations were continued by Kublai Khan, who founded the Mongol Yuan dynasty and granted authority over whole Tibet to Drogon Chogyal Phagpa, nephew of Sakya Pandita. The Sakya-Mongol administrative system and Yuan administrative rule over the region lasted until the mid-14th century, when the Yuan dynasty began to crumble. In the early 17th century, the Oirat Mongols again conquered the region and established the Khoshut Khanate. Since then the Mongols had intervened in Tibetan politics until the Qing conquest of Mongolia and Dzungaria. Invasion =Prior to 1240= According to one traditional Tibetan account, the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan plotted to invade Tibet in 1206, but was dissuaded when the Tibetans promised to pay tribute to the Mongols.Wylie. p.105: 'Why would Chinggis plan an invasion of Tibet as soon as he became Khan of the Mongols in 1206.' Modern scholars consider the account to be anachronistic and factually wrong.Wylie. p.107, 'the statement that the 1240 expedition was a punitive raid for failure to pay tribute is without foundation.' Genghis' campaign was targeted at the Tangut kingdom of Western Xia, not Tibet, and there was certainly no tribute being paid to the Mongols prior to 1240.Wylie. p.106, '...erred in identifying Tibet as the country against Chinggis launched that early campaign. His military objective was the Tangut kingdom of Hsi-hsia.' There is no evidence of interaction between the two nations prior to Doorda Darkhan's invasion in 1240.Wylie. p.106, 'the first instance of military conflict between the two nations' The earliest real Mongol contact with the ethnic Tibetan people came in 1236, when a Tibetan chief near Wenxian submitted to the Mongols campaigning against the Jin dynasty in Sichuan. = 1240 = In 1240, the Mongol Prince Godan, √ñgedei's son and G√ºy√ºk's younger brother, \\"delegated the command of the Tibetan invasion to the TangutC. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and Mongol Empire, p.538 general, Doorda Darqan (Dor-ta)\\".Wylie. p.110. The expedition was \\"the first instance of military conflict between the two nations\\". The attack consisted of 30,000 men (possibly much smaller than that)Shakabpa. p.61: 'thirty thousand troops, under the command of Leje and Dorta, reached Phanpo, north of Lhasa.'Sanders. p. 309, his grandson Godan Khan invaded Tibet with 30,000 men and destroyed several Buddhist monasteries north of Lhasa and resulted in 500 casualties, along with the burning of the Kadampa monasteries of Rwa-sgre·πÖ and Rgyal-lha-khang. The campaign was smaller than the full-scale invasions used by the Mongols against large empires. According to Turrell V. Wylie, that much is in agreement among Tibetologists. However, the purpose of invasion is disputed among Tibetan scholars, partly because of the abundance of anachronistic and factually erroneous sources. However, modern studies find that the oldest sources credit the Mongol scouts with burning Rgyal-lha-khang only, while a large number of Rwa-sgreng monks were slain.Turrel J. Wylie The First Mongol Conquest of Tibet Reinterpreted, pp.110; Tucci, Giuseppe (1949) Tibetan Painted Scrolls, 2 Volumes, Rome: La Libreria dello Stato, Vol. II, p. 652. The bKa‚Äô-brgyud-pa monasteries of sTag-lung and ‚ÄôBri-gung, with their old link to the Western Xia dynasty, were spared because Doorda himself was a Tangut Buddhist.C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.538 The ‚ÄôBri-gung abbot or, according to Petech, the Rwa-sgreng abbot, suggested the Mongols had invited the Sakya hierarch, Sakya Pandita.Petech, Luciano (1990) Central Tibet and the Mongols. Rome: IsIMEO, p. 8. After he met Godan, Sakya Pandita died there leaving his two nephews. Sakya Pandita convinced other monasteries in Central Tibet to align with the Mongols. The Mongols kept them as hostages referring symbolic surrender of Tibet.Wylie. p.112 One view, considered the most traditional, is that the attack was a retaliation on Tibet caused by the Tibetan refusal to pay tribute. Wylie points out that the Tibetans stopped paying tribute in 1227, while Doorda Darkhan's invasion was in 1240, suggesting that the Mongols, not known for their empathy, would not wait over a decade to respond. The text from which this claim is based on also makes other anachronistic mistakes, insisting that Genghis was planning to attack Tibet prior to Doorda Darkhan's invasion, when the real campaign was against the Tangut kingdom of Western Xia. Another theory, supported by Wylie, is that the military action was a reconnaissance campaign meant to evaluate the political situation in Tibet.Wylie. p.110 The Mongols hoped to find a single monarch with whom they could threaten into submission, but instead found a Tibet that was religiously and politically divided, without a central government. A third view is that the troops were sent as raids and \\"looting parties\\", and that the goal of the campaign was to pillage the \\"wealth amassed in the Tibetan monasteries\\".Kwanten, Luc, Imperial Nomads: A History of Central Asia, 500‚Äì1500 (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1979) p.74. This is disputed, as the Mongols deliberately avoided attacking certain monasteries, a questionable decision if their only goal was profit.Wylie. p.107 Whatever the purpose of the invasion, the Mongols withdrew in 1241, as all the Mongol princes were recalled back to Mongolia in preparation for the appointment of a successor to Ogedai Khan.Wylie. p.111 In 1244, the Mongols returned to Tibet. They invited Sakya Pandita to Godan's camp, where he agreed to capitulate Tibet, after the Mongols threatened a full-scale invasion of the region. =Putative invasion under M√∂ngke Khan= The Mongol Empire in 1259 Sa-skya Pandita died in 1251 and his master K√∂ten possibly died at the same time (or, according to other sources, after 1253). M√∂ngke Khan became Khagan in the same year. Some sources say there was a Mongolian invasion in 1251, in retribution for a failure to pay tribute, or in 1251-2 'to take formal possession of the country'. In order to strengthen his control over Tibet, M√∂ngke made Qoridai commander of the Mongol and Han troops in Tufan in 1251. Two attacks are mentioned, one led by D√∂rbetei, the other by Qoridai, and the double campaign struck fear into the Tibetans.Petech 2003 p.342. Tibetan sources however only mention an attack on a place called Bod kyi-mon-mkhar-mgpon-po-gdong. Wyle is sceptical however of all of these sources, arguing that the lack of substantive evidence for an invasion raises doubts about the extent of Mongol movements in Tibet proper.'Wylie, ibid.p.323: 'it is suggested here that references in Chinese sources pertain to campaigns in peripheral areas and that there was no Mongol invasion of central Tibet at that time.' He concludes:- : > \\"Excluding the 1252 attack against the unidentified Mon-mkmar-mgon-po-gdong > mentioned earlier, there seems to be no evidence to prove the presence of > Mongol troops in central Tibet during the two decades that 'Phags-pa Lama > was away from Sa-skya (1244-65). During those years, external campaigns of > conquest and internal feuds between scions of the sons of Chinggis Khan > occupied the attention of the Mongols. Tibet, whose formidable terrain was > politically fragmented by local lords and lamas, posed no military threat to > the Mongols, and it was all but ignored by them.\\"Wylie, ibid. p.326. In 1252-53 Qoridai invaded Tibet, reaching as far as Damxung. The Central Tibetan monasteries submitted to the Mongols. M√∂ngke divided the lands of Tibet between his relatives as their appanages in accordance with Great Jasag of Genghis Khan. Many Mongol aristocrats including Khagan himself seem to have sought blessings of prominent Tibetan lamas. M√∂ngke Khan patronized Karma Baqshi (1204‚Äì83) of the Karma-pa suborder and the ‚ÄôBri-gung Monastery, while Hulagu, khan of the Mongols in the Middle East, sent lavish gifts to both ‚ÄôBri-gung and the Phag-mo-gru-pa suborder's gDan-sa-thel monastery. Later William Rubruck reports that he saw Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian Buddhist monks at the capital city, Karakorum, of the Mongol Empire. Although, Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school politely refused to stay with him, preferring his brother the Khagan, in 1253 Prince Kubilai summoned to his court the Sa-skya- pa hierarch's two nephews, Blo-gros rGyal-mtshan, known as ‚ÄôPhags-Pa lama (1235‚Äì80), and Phyag-na rDo-rje (1239-67) from the late K√∂ten's ordo in Liangzhou. Khubilai Khan first met 'Phags-pa lama in 1253, presumably to bring the Sa-skya lama who resided in K√∂den's domain, and who was a symbol of Tibetan surrender, to his own camp.Wylie p.323-324. At first Kublai remained shamanist, but his chief khatun, Chabui (Chabi), converted to Buddhism and influenced Kublai's religious view. During Kublai's expedition into Yunnan, his number two, Uriyangkhadai, had to station in Tibet in 1254-55 possibly to suppress war-like tribes in Tibet. Hulegu appointed his representative, Kokochu, in Tibet in mid-1250s while marching towards Iran.http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Islam_and_Tibet_Interactions_along_the_Musk_Routes_Intro.pdf Since then, the Ilkhans had had possessions in Tibet. In 1265 Qongridar ravaged the Tufan/mDo-smad area, and from 1264 to 1275 several campaigns pacified the Tibetan and Yi peoples of Xifan around modern Xichang. By 1278 Mongol myriarchies: tumens and postroads reached through () as far west as Litang. Aftermath Tibet within the Yuan dynasty under the top-level department known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan). Tibet was subdued to the Mongol Empire under Mongolian administrative rule,Wylie. p.104: 'To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the Mongol regency.' but the region was granted with a degree of political autonomy. Kublai Khan would later include Tibet into his Yuan dynasty, and the region remained administratively separate from the conquered provinces of Song dynasty China. According to the Tibetan traditional view, the khan and the lama established \\"priest-patron\\" relations. This meant administrative management and military assistance from the khan and assistance from the lama in spiritual issues. Tibet was conquered by the Mongols before the Mongol invasion of South China.Laird 2006, pp. 114-117 After the conquest of the Song dynasty, Kublai Khan consolidated Tibet into the new Yuan dynasty, but Tibet was ruled under the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan), separate from the Chinese provinces. The Mongols granted the Sakya lama a degree political authority, but retained control over the administration and military of the region.Dawa Norbu. China's Tibet Policy, pp. 139. Psychology Press. As efforts to rule both territories while preserving Mongol identity, Kublai Khan prohibited Mongols from marrying Chinese, but left both the Chinese and Tibetan legal and administrative systems intact.Schirokauer, Conrad. A Brief History of Chinese Civilization. Thomson Wadsworth, (c)2006, p 174 Though most government institutions established by Kublai Khan in his court resembled the ones in earlier Chinese dynasties,Rossabi, M. Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times, p56 Tibet never adopted the imperial examinations or Neo-Confucian policies. Buddhist monks from Tibet were popular and well respected in Mongol-ruled Iran (the Ilkhanate), Mongolia, China (the Yuan) and Central Asia (the Chagatai Khanate).Dai Matsui - A Mongolian Decree from the Chaghataid Khanate Towards the end of the Yuan dynasty in the mid-14th century, Tibet regained its independence from the Mongols. Post imperial expedition The Oirats converted to Tibetan Buddhism around 1615, and it was not long before they became involved in the conflict between the Gelug and Karma Kagyu schools. At the request of the Gelug school, in 1637, G√ºshi Khan, the leader of the Khoshuts in Koko Nor, defeated Choghtu Khong Tayiji (1581-1637), the Khalkha prince who supported the Karma Kagyu school. Tsogtu Khuntaiji had established a base on the Tuul river. Known as an intellectual, he embraced the Karma sect and built monasteries and castles. He submitted himself to Ligdan Khan, last grand khan of the Mongols. He took part in Ligdan's campaign to Tibet to help the Karma sect although Ligdan Khan died in 1634 before they joined together. But Tsogtu pursued the campaign. In the same year he conquered the T√ºmed around Kokonor (Qinghai Lake) and moved his base there. By request from Shamar Rabjampa he sent an army under his son Arslan to central Tibet in 1635. However, Arslan attacked his ally, the Tsang army. He met the fifth Dalai Lama and paid homage to Gelukpa monasteries instead of destroying them. Arslan was eventually assassinated by Choghtu's order. The Geluk sect asked for help T√∂r√º Bayikhu (G√ºshi Khan), the leader of the Khoshut tribe of the Oirat confederation. In 1636 T√∂r√∂ Bayikhu led the Khoshuts and the Dzungars to Tibet. In the next year a decisive war between Tsogtu Khuntaiji and T√∂r√º Bayikhu ended in the latter's victory and Tsoghtu was killed. He has traditionally been portrayed as evil by the Geluk sect. On the other hand, the Mongolian movie \\"Tsogt taij\\" (1945) treated him as a national hero. It reflected the communist regime's attitude toward Tibetan Buddhism. With his crushing victory over Tsogtu, G√ºshi Khan conquered Amdo (present-day Qinghai). The unification of Tibet followed in 1641‚Äì42, when G√ºshi Khan invaded Central Tibet and defeated the indigenous Tsangpa Dynasty. After his victory he was proclaimed (chogyal), i.e. the King of Dharma, or Teaching, by the Fifth Dalai Lama. With these events the establishment of a Khoshut Khanate was confirmed. Gushi khan granted to the Dalai Lama authority over Tibet from Dartsedo to Ladakh. The title \\"Dalai Lama\\" itself had previously been bestowed upon the third lama of the Gelug tulku lineage by Altan Khan (not to be confused with the Altan Khans of the Khalkha), and means, in Mongolian, \\"Ocean of Wisdom.\\" Resurfacing of the struggle between Dzungar Khanate and Qing dynasty =Intervention in Tibet= The Dzungar and Kalmyk states (a fragment of the map of the Russian Empire of Peter the Great, created by a Swedish soldier in c. 1725). Amdo, meanwhile, became home to the Khoshuts. The descendants of G√ºshi Khan continued to rule as Dharma kings (chogyals) of Tibet, although they were eclipsed by the Dalai Lama and his regent for long periods. In 1717, however, the Dzungars, led by Tsewang Rabtan's brother Tsering Dondup, invaded Tibet. The invaders defeated and killed Lha-bzang Khan (the last khan of the Khoshut Khanate), a great-grandson of G√ºshi Khan and the fifth Dharma king of Tibet. The Dzungars deposed a pretender to the position of the Dalai Lama who had previously been promoted by Lha-bzang Khan. The 5th Dalai Lama had encouraged Mongolian lamas to prevent any non-dGe-lugs-pa teaching among the Mongols. The Dzungars soon began to loot Lhasa, thus losing initial Tibetan goodwill towards them. Many Nyingmapa and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras (which was said to make the tongue black or brown). This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapa and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras.Norbu, Namkhai. (1980). \\"Bon and Bonpos\\". Tibetan Review, December, 1980, p. 8. This habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom until recent times. The Dzungar invasion was a challenge to the imperial policy of the Kangxi Emperor, since Lha-bzang Khan had been allied to the Qing dynasty. The Emperor retaliated in 1718, but his military expedition suffered inadequate logistics and was annihilated by the Dzungars at the Battle of the Salween River not far from Lhasa.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48-9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk) A second and larger expedition was dispatched by the Emperor and met with rapid success. The Manchus expelled Tsewang Rabtan's force from Tibet in 1720 and the troops were hailed as liberators. They brought K√§lzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the 7th Dalai Lama in 1721.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48-9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk) In 1723 Lobzang Danjin, another descendant of G√ºshi Khan, defended Amdo against Qing dynasty's attempts to extend its rule into Tibet, but was crushed in the following year. Thus, Amdo fell under Chinese domination.  See also  * Tibet under Yuan rule * Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Laird, Thomas.

The phonetic spelling may use the biliteral ' hieroglyph (S38) in place of uniliteral ' (V28). The alternative form ' adds an explicit feminine ending, used alongside the \\"egg\\" determinative (H8) to emphasize the deity's femininity.

Ptolemy II Philadelphus and His World. Leiden: Brill, 2008. page 133. Worship The beginning of her cult dates to the early dynastic period at least. Her name was part of the names of some high-born Second Dynasty individuals buried at Helwan and was mentioned on a stela of Wepemnofret and in the Pyramid Texts. Early frog statuettes are often thought to be depictions of her. Heqet was considered the wife of Khnum, who formed the bodies of new children on his potter's wheel.Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. p. 229 In the Osiris myth, it was Heqet who breathed life into the new body of Horus at birth, as she was a goddess of the last moments of birth. As the birth of Horus became more intimately associated with the resurrection of Osiris, so Heqet's role became one more closely associated with resurrection. Eventually, this association led to her amulets gaining the phrase I am the resurrection in the Christian era along with cross and lamb symbolism. A temple dedicated to Horus and Heqet dating to the Ptolemaic Period was found at Qus.Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind.

This association, which appears to have arisen during the Middle Kingdom, gained her the title She who hastens the birth (cf. the role of Heqet in the story of The Birth of the Royal Children from the Westcar Papyrus). Some say that--even though no ancient Egyptian term for \\"midwife\\" is known for certain--midwives often called themselves the Servants of Heqet, and that her priestesses were trained in midwifery.

Aishwarya feels bad for Deepika and tries to leave the matter, but couldn't when she finds letters written by Vamsi, Deepika's boyfriend. She reads them and gets moved by the emotion in it. She decides to break the information of Deepika's suicide to Vamsi, but first, she writes a letter to him as Deepika to prepare him for the bad news. On the other hand, Vamsi was no more as he dies in an accident while coming to Deepika to marry her. Incidentally, Kiran was Vamsi's friend and receives the letter written by Aishwarya.

History The end of Hanalei Pier as it appeared in 1978. The wetlands of Hanalei Bay were used to grow taro by ancient Hawaiians. By the 1860s, the shrinking population of native Hawaiians was being replaced by ethnic Chinese people when their contracts expired on sugarcane plantations in Hawaii, such as the one directly to the north in Princeville. The new crop was rice, which was shipped to Honolulu to become the second largest export crop of the islands. After the annexation of Hawaii to the US in 1898, Hawaiian rice could not compete with rice grown in California and shipments declined. The pier was originally built of wood before 1892. In the early 1900s work began to extend the pier, and it was eventually lengthened to in 1912. In 1921 the legislature authorized US$25,000 for a new concrete deck, as the wooden deck was too difficult to maintain in the tropical climate. Conney and Morris were selected as contractors, and finished the construction of the new deck by the end of 1922. A shed roof was constructed at the far end of the pier in the 1940s. The pier has been a gathering place for the citizens of Hanalei since it was abandoned for shipping in 1933. It was also the main filming area for the 1954 film Beachheadhttp://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/hanalei-history-part-5.asp and the 1957 film South Pacific. The pier was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii on September 13, 1979 as site 79000757. The pier was heavily damaged in 1992 as a result of Hurricane Iniki. In 2012-13, the canopy at the end of the pier was restored. The Hanalei Rotary Club raised over $170,000 to restore the neglected canopy in a program coined \\"Save the Pier.\\" Although originally owned by the state, the land at the base of the pier is a Kauai County park known as Black Pot Beach. It is located at the end of Weke Road north of Route 560 at . Adjacent to the north is the mouth of the Hanalei River, where a public boat landing provides recreational and commercial access.

March 1212 - 25 February 1246) was Prince of Gwynedd from 1240 to 1246. He was the first ruler to claim the title Prince of Wales.  Birth and descent  Though birth years of 1208, 1206, and 1215 have been put forward for Dafydd, it has recently been persuasively argued that he was born shortly after Easter 1212. Born at Castell Hen Blas, Coleshill, Bagillt in Flintshire, he was the only son of Llywelyn the Great by his wife, Joan (daughter of King John). His grandfather was facing trouble in England against his Barons when he was born. In his final years, Llywelyn went to great lengths to have Dafydd accepted as his sole heir. By Welsh law, Dafydd's older half-brother Gruffydd had a claim to be Llywelyn's successor. Llywelyn had Dafydd recognised as his named heir by his uncle King Henry III in 1220, and also had Dafydd's mother Joan declared legitimate by the Pope to strengthen Dafydd's claim.  Conflict  The arms of Gwynedd There was considerable support for Gruffydd in Gwynedd. Although Dafydd lost one of his most important supporters when his mother died in 1237, he retained the support of Ednyfed Fychan, the Seneschal of Gwynedd who wielded great political influence. Llywelyn suffered a paralytic stroke in 1237, and Dafydd took an increasing role in government. Dafydd ruled Gwynedd following his father's death in 1240. Although Henry III had accepted his claim to rule Gwynedd, he was not disposed to allow him to retain his father's conquests outside Gwynedd. As the diplomatic situation deteriorated, Dafydd began to explore alliances with others against Henry, and is known to have sent ambassadors to the court of Louis IX of France. In August 1241, however, the King invaded Gwynedd, and after a short campaign, Dafydd was forced to submit. Under the terms of the Treaty of Gwerneigron, he had to give up all his lands outside Gwynedd, and also to hand over to the King his half-brother Gruffydd, whom he had imprisoned. Henry thereby gained what could have been a useful weapon against Dafydd, with the possibility of setting Gruffydd up as a rival to Dafydd in Gwynedd, but in March 1244 Gruffydd fell to his death while trying to escape from the Tower of London by climbing down a knotted sheet.  Later reign and death  This freed Dafydd's hands, and he entered into an alliance with other Welsh princes to attack English possessions in Wales. He enjoyed several successes in the north: by March 1245 he had recovered the castle of Mold along with his former possessions in modern-day Flintshire, and it is possible that the castle of Dyserth also fell to his men in the summer. In August 1245 King Henry again invaded Gwynedd, but his army suffered a defeat in a narrow pass by Dafydd's men. Undaunted, Henry proceeded as far as the river Conwy, and began building a new castle at Deganwy. Dafydd also began diplomacy with Pope Innocent IV, the result of which was a recognition by the Vatican of his right to rule over north Wales. After a flurry of diplomatic activity by Henry, the decision was reversed in 1245. Savage fighting continued at Deganwy until Henry, some of whose supplies had been captured by the Welsh, ran short of provisions. A truce was agreed and Henry's army withdrew in the autumn. The truce remained in effect throughout the winter, but the war was effectively ended by the sudden death of Dafydd in the royal home at Abergwyngregyn, in February 1246. He was buried with his father at the abbey of Aberconwy. The writer of Brut y Tywysogyon described him as tarian Cymru - the shield of Wales. The poet Dafydd Benfras composed an elegy in his honour.  Succession  Since Dafydd's marriage to Isabella de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, had failed to produce an heir (though some early modern genealogists record him as having sired sons, including Dafydd) the two elder sons of Gruffydd, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Owain ap Gruffydd, divided Gwynedd between them and continued the war with King Henry until April 1247, when Llywelyn and Owain met the King at Woodstock and came to terms with him at the cost of the loss of much territory. The pair would continue to rule over Gwynedd jointly until Llywelyn's victory over Owain at the battle of Bryn Derwin in 1255.

David, son of Gruffydd; ) (11 July (?) 1238 ‚Äì 3 October 1283) was Prince of Wales from 11 December 1282 until his execution on 3 October 1283 by King Edward I of England. He was the last independent ruler of Wales. Early life He was a prince of Gwynedd, a younger son of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and his wife, Senena, and thus grandson of Llywelyn Fawr. In 1241, he is recorded as having been handed over to Henry III of England as a hostage with his younger brother, Rhodri, as part of an agreement. He may have come of age under Welsh law on 11 July 1252, on which date he issued, in front of his mother, Senena, and the Bishop of Bangor, a charter as lord of the commote of Cymydmaen, at the outer reaches of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula. In 1253, he was called upon to pay homage to King Henry III of England. In 1255, he joined his brother, Owain, in a challenge to their brother, Llywelyn, but Llywelyn defeated them at the Battle of Bryn Derwin. Dafydd was imprisoned, but Llywelyn released him the following year and restored him to favour. In 1263, he joined King Henry in an attack on his brother. After Llywelyn was acknowledged by King Henry as Prince of Wales in 1267, Dafydd was again restored to Llywelyn's favour, but in 1274, he joined King Edward I of England to challenge Llywelyn once again. In 1277, following the Treaty of Aberconwy, he was reconciled, finally, with his brother. Prince of Wales At Easter 1282, Dafydd ap Gruffudd attacked Hawarden Castle, thereby starting the final conflict with Plantagenet-ruled England, in the course of which Welsh independence was lost. In December Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, had been lured into what was probably a trap and killed on 11 December 1282 (see corr. of Archbishop John Peckham, Lambeth Palace Archives) . Dafydd was his brother's successor and became the last Tywysog of Gwynedd and Prince of Wales. Dafydd was leader of his nation only for a few months after his brother's death. By January 1283, Edward I of England had the heartland of independent Wales ringed with a massive army. Dafydd initially operated from Dolwyddelan and was supported by various royal refugees from Powys Fadog and Deheubarth; including Rhys Wyndod, Rhys Ieuanc and the sons of Maredudd ab Owain. With limited resources of manpower and equipment available the passes leading to Dolwyddelan became indefensible and Dafydd moved down to Castell y Bere. In April, Castell y Bere was besieged by over 3,000 men, and the small Welsh garrison, commanded by Cynfrig ap Madog, surrendered on 25 April. Dafydd escaped the siege and moved north to Dolbadarn Castle, a guardpost in the Peris Valley at the foot of Snowdon. In May 1283, he was forced to move again, this time to the mountains above the Welsh royal home in Abergwyngregyn. > \\"Those who survived fled for refuge to the inaccessible rocks of Snowdonia > and David with a few followers hid himself for some months at different > places and suffered hunger and cold. At last he retreated to a bog > (Nanhysglain), near Bera Mawr about four miles above Aber with his wife two > sons and seven daughters. His place of retreat was known to Einion Bishop of > Bangor and Gronw ab Dafydd, who basely betrayed him.\\" On 22 June, Dafydd and his younger son Owain ap Dafydd were captured at Nanhysglain, a secret hiding place in a bog by Bera Mountain to the south of Abergwyngregyn. Dafydd, seriously wounded (graviter vulneratus) in the struggle, was brought to King Edward's camp at Rhuddlan that same night (Cotton Vesp. B xi, f30). Dafydd was taken from here to Chester and then on to Shrewsbury. Dafydd's wife Elizabeth de Ferrers, their daughter Gwladys, infant niece Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, and Dafydd's six illegitimate daughters were also taken prisoner at the same time. Whether they were with Dafydd and Owain at Bera is not recorded, but it is likely. On 28 June, Llywelyn ap Dafydd was captured. Edward triumphantly proclaimed that the last of the \\"treacherous lineage\\", princes of the \\"turbulent nation\\", was now in his grasp, captured by men of his own nation (per homines linguae suae).Note: Much has been read into this latter statement regarding Llywelyn ap Dafydd's betrayal, but it has to be taken in context with the other events of 1283, the fact that Llywelyn's father and brother had been taken, and the size of the army that had by now occupied Snowdonia. Welsh resistance to the invasion temporarily came to an end. On 28 June, Edward issued writs to summon a parliament to meet at Shrewsbury, to discuss Dafydd's fate. On 30 September, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, was condemned to death, the first person known to have been tried and executed for what from that time onwards would be described as high treason against the King. Edward ensured that Dafydd's death was to be slow and agonising, and also historic; he became the first prominent person in recorded history to have been hanged, drawn and quartered, preceded by a number of minor knights earlier in the thirteenth century. Dafydd was dragged through the streets of Shrewsbury attached to a horse's tail, then hanged alive, revived, then disembowelled and his entrails burned before him for \\"his sacrilege in committing his crimes in the week of Christ's passion\\", and then his body cut into four-quarters \\"for plotting the king's death\\". Geoffrey of Shrewsbury was paid 20 shillings for carrying out the gruesome act on 3 October 1283. Dafydd's daughter Gwladys, like her cousin Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, was sent to a convent in Lincolnshire ‚Äì Gwenllian to Sempringham and Gwladys to Sixhills, where she died in 1336. Dafydd's sons were both imprisoned at Bristol Castle; Llywelyn ap Dafydd died at Bristol Castle in mysterious circumstances in 1287 or 1288, while Owain ap Dafydd is last found living in August 1325. Dafydd may have had another (illegitimate) son, Dafydd Goch, who survived. One cadet member of the ruling House of Aberffraw also survived, Madog ap Llywelyn, who led a nationwide revolt in 1294‚Äì95. Family Dafydd's parents were Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (died 1244) and his wife's name was Senana. =Brothers= *Owain Goch ap Gruffydd (died c. 1282) *Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales (killed at Battle of Orewin Bridge at Builth Wells, 11 December 1282) married Eleanor de Montfort, daughter of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. They had one daughter, Gwenllian. Eleanor died in childbirth at Llywelyn's court at Abergwyngregyn on 19 June 1282. *Rhodri ap Gruffudd (died c. 1315) married 1) Beatrice, daughter of David of Malpas. 2) unknown. He had a son Thomas ap Rhodri (died 1363) by his second marriage, who was the father of Owain ap Thomas (died 1378). =Sisters= *Gwladus ferch Gruffudd (died 1261) married Rhys Fychan (died 1271) of Ystrad Tywi. *Margaret ferch Gruffudd married Madog II ap Gruffydd, Lord of Dinas Bran (died 1277) of Powys Fadog. They had two sons, Gruffudd ap Madog and Llywelyn ap Madog. The two boys died in mysterious circumstances shortly after the outbreak of war in 1282. Thomas PennantTours in Wales (1874), citing a manuscript communicated by the Reverend Mr Price, Keeper of the Bodleian Library. states that the boys were \\"drowned in the River Dee\\" at Holt by their guardians John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Roger Mortimer the younger.

Dafydd ap Gruffudd married (sometime after 1265) Lady Elizabeth Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, and the widow of William Marshal, 2nd Baron Marshal (not the Earl of Pembroke). *Through the marriage Dafydd came into possession of the manor of Folesham, Norfolk. He exchanged Folesham with John Marshal for the manor of Norton, Northamptonshire. *September 1278, he accepted a grant for life from Edward l, King of England, of the manor of Frodsham, near Chester.CCR, 1272‚Äì79, 317; CPR, 1272‚Äì81, 279. =Children= After Dafydd's capture his sons were imprisoned for the rest of their lives at Bristol Castle; his daughter was sent to a convent. * Llywelyn ap Dafydd (died 1287) * Owain ap Dafydd (died c.1325) * Gwladys ferch Dafydd (died 1336) In addition, Dafydd is recorded in late genealogical sources as having sired an illegitimate child, Dafydd Goch, though there is no contemporary evidence to support this.

The infusion is programmable by the prescriber. If it is programmed and functioning as intended, the machine is unlikely to deliver an overdose of medication. Providers must always observe the first administration of any PCA medication which has not already been administered by the provider to respond to allergic reactions. Routes of administration =Oral= The most common form of patient-controlled analgesia is self-administration of oral over-the-counter or prescription painkillers. For example, if a headache does not resolve with a small dose of an oral analgesic, more may be taken. As pain is a combination of tissue damage and emotional state, being in control means reducing the emotional component of pain. =Intravenous= intravenous administration of morphine for postoperative analgesia In a hospital setting, a PCA refers to an electronically controlled infusion pump that delivers an amount of intravenous analgesic when the patient presses a button. PCA can be used for both acute and chronic pain patients. It is commonly used for post-operative pain management, and for end-stage cancer patients. Narcotics are the most common analgesics administered through PCAs. It is important for caregivers to monitor patients for the first two to twenty-four hours to ensure they are using the device properly. With a PCA the patient is protected from overdose by the caregiver programming the PCA to deliver a dose at set intervals. If the patient presses the button sooner than the prescribed intake pressing the button does not operate the PCA. (The PCA can be set to emit a beep telling the patient a dose was NOT delivered). Dosage is also controlled when the patient is too sedated to press the button; preventing the patient from receiving needless doses and keeping the patient safe from overdosing. =Epidural= Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is a related term describing the patient-controlled administration of analgesic medicine in the epidural space, by way of intermittent boluses or infusion pumps. This can be used by women in labour, terminally ill cancer patients or to manage post- operative pain. =Inhaled= In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self- administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter with a 1 inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15 milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15 milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. =Nasal= Patient Controlled Intranasal Analgesia (PCINA or Nasal PCA) refers to PCA devices in a Nasal spray form with inbuilt features to control the number of sprays that can be delivered in a fixed time period. =Transcutaneous= Transcutaneous delivery systems, including iontophoretic systems, are available. These are popular for administration of opioids such as fentanyl, or local anesthetics such as lidocaine. Iontocaine is one example of such a system. Advantages and disadvantages Advantages of patient-controlled analgesia include self-delivery of pain medication, faster alleviation of pain because the patient can address pain with medication, and dosage monitoring by medical staff (dosage can be increased or decreased depending on need). With a PCA the patient spends less time in pain and as a corollary to this, patients tend to use less medication than in cases in which medication is given according to a set schedule or on a timer. Disadvantages include the possibility that a patient will use the pain medication non-medically, self-administering the narcotic for its euphoric properties even though the patient's pain is sufficiently controlled. If a PCA device is not programmed properly for the patient this can result in an under- dose or overdose in a medicine. The system may also be inappropriate for certain individuals, for example patients with learning difficulties or confusion. Also, patients with poor manual dexterity may be unable to press the buttons as would those who are critically ill. PCA may not be appropriate for younger patients. History The PCA pump was developed and introduced by Philip H. Sechzer in the late 1960s and described in 1971.

He is most famous for being Billie Holiday's accompanist from 1946 to 1949. Music career =Billie Holiday= On November 12, 1946, during Billie Holiday's stay at the Down Beat Club, Bobby Tucker was drafted to accompany Holiday because Eddie Heywood refused his opportunity. Billie's stay at the Down Beat was so successful due to Tucker's playing that she decided to keep him as her accompanist.

The Portuguese successfully resisted the four months long siege. It is part of The Ottoman-Portuguese War. Background In 1509, the major Battle of Diu (1509) took place between the Portuguese and a joint fleet of the Sultan of Gujarat, the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, the Zamorin of Calicut with support of the Ottoman Empire. Since 1517, the Ottomans had attempted to combine forces with Gujarat in order to fight the Portuguese away from the Red Sea and in the area of India. Pro-Ottoman forces under Captain Hoca Sefer had been installed by Selman Reis in Diu. Diu in Gujarat (now a state in western India), was with Surat, one of the main points of supply of spices to Ottoman Egypt at that time. However, Portuguese intervention thwarted that trade by controlling the traffic in the Red Sea. In 1530, the Venetians could not obtain any supply of spices through Egypt. Under the command of Governor Nuno da Cunha, the Portuguese had attempted to capture Diu by force in February 1531, unsuccessfully. Thereafter, the Portuguese waged war on Gujarat, devastating its shores and several cities like Surat.Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda, Hist√≥ria do Descobrimento e Conquista da √çndia pelo Portugueses 1833 edition, Lisboa Typographia Rollandiana, book VIII p.20 Soon after however, the Sultan of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, who was under threat from the Mughal emperor Humayun, made an agreement with the Portuguese, granting them Diu in exchange for Portuguese assistance against the Mughals and protection should the realm fall. The Portuguese seized the stronghold of Gogala (Bender-i T√ºrk) near the city, and built the Diu Fort. Once the threat from Humayun was removed, Bahadur tried to negotiate the withdrawal of the Portuguese, but on 13 February 1537 he died drowning during the negotiations on board of a Portuguese ship in unclear circumstances, both sides blaming the other for the tragedy. Bahadur Shah had also appealed to the Ottomans to expel the Portuguese, which led to the 1538 expedition. Ottoman fleet Upon the arrival of Sultan Bahadur's envoy to Egypt with a large tribute in 1536, the Ottoman governor (pasha) of Egypt, 60-year-old eunuch Hadim Suleiman Pasha, was nominated by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to organize and personally lead an expedition to India. Pasha Suleiman forbade any shipping out of the Red Sea to avoid leaking information to the Portuguese in India.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538, p. 332 There were delays however due to the Siege of Coron in the Mediterranean, and the Ottoman-Safavid war of 1533‚Äì1535. According to the Tarikh al-Shihri, Ottoman forces amounted to 80 vessels and 40,000 men.Tarikh al-Shihri, in SERJEANT, Robert Bertram (1963). The Portuguese off the South Arabian Coast Clarendon Press, p. 79 Gaspar Correia provides a more specific account, claiming that the Turks assembled at Suez an armada composed of 15 \\"bastard galleys\\" (it), 40 \\"royal galleys\\", 6 galliots, 5 galleons \\"with four masts each\\" that were \\"dangerous ships to sail, for they were shallow with no keel\\"; five smaller craft, six foists from Gujarat, and two brigs. It carried over 400 artillery pieces in total, over 10,000 sailors and rowers (of which 1,500 were Christian) and 6,000 soldiers, of which 1,500 were janissaries. The Pasha employed a Venetian renegade, Francisco, as captain of 10 galleys, plus 800 Christian mercenaries.Gaspar Correia (1558‚Äì1563) Lendas da √çndia, 1864 edition, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, book IV pp. 868‚Äì870. Gaspar Correia states to have gotten this information from a \\"Christian rower that fled to Diu from the galleys\\" On July 20, 1538, the armada set sail from Jeddah, stopping by Kamaran Island before proceeding to Aden. At Aden, Pasha Suleiman captured the city after inviting its ruler, Sheikh Amir bin Dawaud, favourable towards the Portuguese, aboard his ships, then hanging him. Thus, Aden was occupied without a siege, and plundered.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538, p. 331 The expedition left Aden on August 19 and then called at Socotra, thereafter making its way to the western coast of Gujarat, despite losing some ships that got separated from the fleet during the passage of the Indian Ocean.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538, p. 321‚Äì323 It was the largest Ottoman fleet ever sent into the Indian Ocean.Nicola Melis, \\"The chronicle of Lopo de Sousa Coutinho as a major source of the first siege of Diu\\", in \\"The Indian Ocean and the Presence of the Ottoman Navy in the 16th and 17th Centuries\\", edited by Naval Forces Staff, Naval Printing House, Istanbul 2009, part III, pp. 15‚Äì25. The Siege Portuguese depiction of a Gujarati foot-soldier (and his wife) Turkish galleys, 17th century The captain of Diu at the time was the experienced Ant√≥nio da Silveira, former captain of Bassein and Hormuz who had participated in the Portuguese-Gujarati War of 1531‚Äì34. The Portuguese fortress housed about 3,000 people, of which solely 600 were soldiers. =First attacks= Under the command of Khadjar Safar ‚Äì Coge Sofar in Portuguese, an Albanian renegade from Otranto and an influential lord in Gujarat\\"Cosa Zaffer\\" in RAMUSIO, Giovanni Battista (1550‚Äì1606) Navigazioni e Viaggi Turin, Giulio Einaudi editore, 1978 edition, p.684 ‚Äì the Gujarati forces began crossing the channel of Diu onto the western side of the island on June 26, 1538, being held back by the city's western walls just long enough for the Portuguese to fill their water reserves and burn their supply storages in the city before finally retreating to the fortress on the eastern end of the island. For the following two months the Gujaratis were unable to threaten the besieged with more than a low-intensity bombardment, while the Portuguese conducted occasional raids on the Gujarati positions. Lopo de Sousa Coutinho, who would later write his memoirs on the siege, distinguished himself on August 14 after leading 14 Portuguese in a sortie into the city to capture supplies, defeating 400 soldiers of Khadjar Safar. On September 4, the Ottoman fleet arrived in Diu, catching the Portuguese garrison by surprise and thus blockading the fortress by sea.An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire by Halil ƒ∞nalcik p.324ff Captain da Silveira immediately sent a small craft to run the blockade with a distress call to Goa, while Pasha Suleiman promptly landed 500 janissaries, who proceeded to plunder the city ‚Äì causing Suleiman to fall out of favour with the lords of Gujarat but Khadjar Safar.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538, p.325 The janissaries then attempted to scale the fortress' walls but were repelled with 50 dead. On September 7, a strong storm fell upon Diu, damaging part of the Ottoman fleet (and helping the Portuguese restore their water supplies), after which the Turks began unloading their artillery and a further 1,000 men, and raising a number of defensive and siege works around the fort. It seems by then the Gujarati lords became distrustful of the Ottomans, possibly fearing that they might establish themselves in Diu after expelling the Portuguese, and the following day refused to provide any further supplies. On September 14th, four foists from Goa and Chaul arrived with reinforcements. A distant eyewitness, the famous Portuguese traveler Fern√£o Mendes Pinto later recounted how, passing by the fortress, Turkish galleys came close to seizing the tradeship he traveled in: The Ottoman artillery opened fire on the fortress on the 28th, as their galleys bombarded it from the sea, with the Portuguese replying in suit ‚Äì the Portuguese sank a galley but lost several men as two of their basilisks exploded.Lopo de Sousa Coutinho O Primeiro Cerco de Diu Lisboa, Publica√ß√µes Alfa, 1989 edition, p.130 ‚Äì According to Coutinho, a witness, the Portuguese accidentally swapped the gunpowder barrels, using finer gunpowder meant for arquebuses instead of cruder gunpowder for the cannon, causing them to explode, killing 4 men =Attack on the Village of the Rumes' Redoubt= Across the Diu channel on the mainland shore, the Portuguese kept a redoubt by a village dubbed Vila dos Rumes ‚Äì \\"Village of the Rumes\\" (Turks) modern day Gogol√° ‚Äì commanded by Captain Francisco Pacheco and defended by 30‚Äì40 Portuguese, which came under attack by Gujarati forces. On September 10 the army of Khadjar Safar bombarded the fortlet with Turkish artillery pieces before attempting to assault it with the aid of janissaries, but were repelled. Khadjar Safar then ordered a craft be filled with timber, sulphur, and tar, with which he hoped to place by the redoubt and smoke the Portuguese out. Realizing his intentions, Ant√≥nio da Silveira sent Francisco de Gouveia with a small crew on a craft to burn the device with fire bombs under cover of night, despite coming under enemy fire.Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda, Hist√≥ria do Descobrimento e Conquista da √çndia pelos Portugueses, 1833 edition, Lisbon, Typographia Rollandiana, book VIII p.448 Another assault on September 28 with 700 janissaries failed after a prolonged bombardment. The Portuguese garrison resisted until its captain Pacheco agreed to surrender to the Pasha on October 1, who had granted them safe passage to the fortress unharmed. When they surrendered however, Suleiman promptly had them imprisoned on his galleys.Correia, Gaspar (1558‚Äì1563) Lendas da √çndia, 1864 edition, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, book IV chapter XI pp.29‚Äì35 Janissary, circa 1577 =The message of Francisco Pacheco and Captain Ant√≥nio da Silveiras reply= Thus under the Pashas power, former captain Francisco Pacheco wrote a letter to captain Ant√≥nio da Silveira, advising him to lay down arms; it was delivered by a Portuguese renegade Ant√≥nio Faleyro, who had converted to Islam and dressed in the Turkish fashion, that he was at first unrecognizable by his former comrades. It read: Captain Ant√≥nio da Silveira, who considered the Pasha's conduct to have been treasonous (and Pachecos advice outrageous), replied in the following manner: The writer Gaspar Correia provided a different account of the exchange, however it is not in accordance with that of the veteran Lopo de Sousa Coutinho, who personally participated in the siege.Gaspar Correia (1558‚Äì1563) Lendas da √çndia, 1864 edition, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, book IV p.35 =Assault on the fortress= Portuguese soldiers, 1619. Painting by Andr√© Reinoso By October 5, the Turks had finished their siege works and assembled all their artillery, which included nine basilisks, five great bombards, fifteen heavy guns, and 80 medium and smaller cannonLopo de Sousa Coutinho (1556) O Primeiro Cerco de Diu Lisboa, Publica√ß√µes Alfa, 1989 edition, p.148 that bombarded the fortress for the following 27 days. That night, 5 more craft from Goa with gunpowder and reinforcements arrived. After seven days of bombardment, part of the bulwark of Gaspar de Sousa collapsed and the Turks attempted to scale it \\"with two banners\\", but were repelled with heavy losses to bombs and arquebus fire. Another assault the following morning was met with equally fierce resistance by the Portuguese. Afterwards, the Turks forced labourers into the moat to undermine the fortress' walls and, in spite of several losses, managed to open a breach with gunpowder, but already the Portuguese had raised a barricade around the breach from the inside, which caused many losses on the assailants once they attempted to break through.Gaspar Correia (1558‚Äì1563) Lendas da √çndia, 1864 edition, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, book IV pp.37‚Äì39 When at night the bombardment ceased, the Portuguese repaired the fortress' walls under the cover of darkness. From an artillery battery on the opposite shore, the Turks bombarded the \\"Sea Fort\\" (Baluarte do Mar) that stood in the middle of the river mouth bombarding the flank of Muslim positions. On October 27, Suleiman Pasha ordered 6 small galleys to attempt to scale the fortlet, but came under heavy Portuguese cannon fire. The following day, the Turks drew 12 galleys and again attempted to \\"board\\" the fortlet, but were repelled with heavy losses due to fire bombs.Gaspar Correia (1558‚Äì1563) Lendas da √çndia, 1864 edition, Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, book IV pp.42‚Äì45 On October 30, Pasha Suleiman attempted a final diversion by faking the withdrawal of his forces, embarking 1,000 men. Ever cautious, Ant√≥nio da Silveira ordered the sentries to be alert ‚Äì at daybreak, 14,000 men divided in three \\"banners\\" attempted to scale the fortress as it was bombarded with no regard to friendly fire. A few hundred troops managed to scale the walls and raise banners but the Portuguese managed to repel the assailants, killing 500 and wounding a further 1,000 from gunfire and bombs out of the S√£o Tom√© bastion. With his relation with Coja Safar and the Gujaratis degrading and increasingly fearful of being caught off-hand by the Viceroy's armada, on November 1 the Pasha finally decided to abandon the siege and began re-embarking his troops. Suspecting another ruse from the Pasha, Captain Silveira ordered 20 of his last men on a sortie to deceive the enemy of their dwindling forces. The party managed to capture a Turkish banner. The Pasha however, intended on departing on November 5, but was unable due to unfavourable weather. That night, two small galleys reached Diu with reinforcements and supplies, firing their guns and signal rockets. The following morning, a fleet of 24 small galleys was sighted and believing it to be the vanguard of the governor's rescue fleet, the Pasha hurriedly departed, leaving 1,200 dead and 500 wounded behind. Khadjar Safar then set fire to his encampment and abandoned the island with his forces shortly after. In reality, it was just a forward fleet under the command of Ant√≥nio da Silva Meneses and Dom Lu√≠s de Ata√≠de, dispatched from Goa with reinforcements, supplies, and news that the governor would depart soon to their aid. Although they took no part in the fighting, the small force was triumphantly received within the ruined fortress by its last survivors. The Portuguese were by then critically low on gunpowder and supplies and with less than 40 valid men; in the final stages of the siege, the Portuguese record that even the women assisted in its defence. Catarina Lopes and Isabel Madeira are examples of two female captains who actively participated during the siege, they led a squad of female soldiers.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538 p.330 Goa Goa, head of all Portuguese possessions in the East The craft sent by Ant√≥nio da Silveira arrived in Goa in mid September, but already governor Nuno da Cunha was well aware of the presence of the Turks in India: the Portuguese had intercepted a Turkish galleon in southern India and another galley that got separated from the fleet and called at Honavar, which the Portuguese destroyed with the aid of the locals (a fight in which Fern√£o Mendes Pinto participated). The governor had assembled a relief force of 14 galleons 8 galleys, several caravels and over 30 smaller oar ships, but in September 14 the new viceroy appointed by Lisbon arrived, and demanded the immediate succession in office.Saturnino Monteiro (1995) Portuguese Sea Battles ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì Christianity, Commerce and Corso 1522‚Äì1538 p.331 By the end of 1537, reports on Ottoman preparations in Egypt had reached Lisbon through Venice, and King John III promptly ordered a reinforcement of 11 naus and 3,000 soldiers, of which 800 were fidalgos, to be dispatched to India as soon as possible along with the new viceroy, Dom Garcia de Noronha. At Goa however, Dom Garcia considered the relief force organized by governor Nuno da Cunha to be insufficient, though the Portuguese veterans in India argued otherwise. The viceroy remained in Goa for two more months, organizing his forces until he had gathered an imposing fleet, which according to Jo√£o de Barros numbered 170 sail and 4500 Portuguese soldiers, and according to a detailed report by Francisco de Andrade, was composed of 152 vessels, which included 9 heavy carracks, 14 galleons, 13 small carracks, 8 war-caravels, 5 latin caravels, 1 bastard galley, 13 royal galleys, 15 galleots, 11 Mediterranean brigantines, 2 albeto√ßas, 18 light galleys and 44 light vessels and oarcraft, bearing 5000 Portuguese soldiers, 3000 Indian auxiliaries, 1500 Portuguese sailors, uncounted number of native sailors, oarsmen and combat slaves and a little under 400 heavy cannon and 600 light cannon.Primeiro Roteiro da Costa da √çndia; desde Goa at√© Diu; Narrando a viagem que fez o Vice-Rei D.

The defeat of the combined Turkish and Gujarati forces at Diu represented a critical setback in Ottoman plans for expanding their influence into the Indian Ocean. Without a suitable base or allies, failure at Diu meant the Ottomans were unable to proceed with their campaign in India, leaving the Portuguese uncontested in the western Indian coast. Never again would the Ottoman Turks ever send so large an armada to India. After the failed siege, the Ottomans returned to Aden, where they fortified the city with 100 pieces of artillery.An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire by Halil ƒ∞nalcik p.326 One of them is still visible today at the Tower of London, following the capture of Aden by British forces in 1839.Tower of London exhibit Suleiman Pasha also established Ottoman suzerainty over Shihr and Zabid, and reorganized the territories of Yemen and Aden as an Ottoman province, or Beylerbeylik. The veteran Lopo de Sousa Coutinho later recounted that \\"it was said\\" that the Portuguese who had surrendered to Suleiman Pasha were all killed off in the Red Sea, on their way back to Egypt. Indeed, at As- Salif, by Kamaran Island, the Pasha had all prisoners under his control massacred, 140 in total, and their heads put on display in Cairo.Tarikh al- Shihri, in SERJEANT, Robert Bertram (1963).

It grows to between 2.5 and 4 metres high and has purplish-violet inflorescences. Leaves are smooth and sharp pointed, with thick margins and are 40 to 100 mm long and 6 to 18 mm wide. The cultivar was first selected in Berlin in 1913 from plants raised from seed collected near Como, New South Wales by German botanist Ernst Betsche in 1894. At this time, it was referred to as C. lanceolatus var lilacina. In 1925 Edwin Cheel gave the cultivar the species name Callistemon lilacinus, but this was later brought in line with other cultivars and amended to C. 'Lilacinus'. The cultivar has often been referred to as C. 'Violaceus'. Two other forms of C.lilacinus were described by Cheel: *C lilacinus f. albus, which was \\"discovered in nature\\" at Long Bay by Mr H. Burrell, and currently given the name C. citrinus 'Lilacinus Albus'. *C lilacinus f. carminus, a reddish-purple flowering form exhibited at the Linnean Society of New South Wales and currently given the name C. citrinus 'Lilacinus Carminus'.

Known as the \\"Mother Teresa of Puerto Rico\\", she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her humanitarian work. Ferr√© Aguayo was born in Ponce to a wealthy family. She was one of six siblings, Jose, Carlos, Hernan, Rosario and Luis, Puerto Rico's former governor. When she was 21, Ferr√© traveled to the United States where she commenced her novitiate. After five years, she completed the solemn vows. As part of her religious work, Ferr√© traveled back and forth between Puerto Rico and the United States, serving as an abbess in Cabo Rojo and New York City. During this time frame, she attended various universities in the United States, studying sociology and arts. After working as a member of New York City's Committee Against Poverty, to which she was appointed by Mayor John Lindsay, Ferr√© decided in 1969, to set her permanent residence in Ponce, specifically in the low-income sector of La Playa. There she founded a small hospital and a school/resource center named Centro de Orientaci√≥n y Servicios de La Playa de Ponce. The school/resource center would later become Centros Sor Isolina Ferr√© and opened numerous outlets throughout Puerto Rico at large. Ferr√© Aguayo is a member of Mu Alpha Phi sorority. Early life Ferr√© was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Antonio Ferr√© and Mary Aguayo. Born into a wealthy family of recent European background, she was one of six children. Her siblings included Luis, Jos√©, Carlos, Rosario, and Herm√°n Ferr√©.Mendoza et al. Throughout the years, the Ferr√© family owned several companies in Puerto Rico, ranging from factories to newspapers. However, she was inclined towards a religious life from a young age. Her father was Catholic, but left the church when, at the request of a dying friend, he joined the Freemasons.Ramos et al., p.43 The other members of the family attended a church named Iglesia de la Monserrate located in Hormigueros. Her mother used to spend her time in benevolent activities, often donating toys to orphaned children.Ramos et al., p.45-46 Her mother contracted Filaria, which limited her social and personal activities, therefore Saro, Ferr√©'s older sister, became responsible for the upbringing of the younger children. When she was three years old, Ferr√© entered a religious school named Colegio de las Madres del Sagrado Coraz√≥n, where she became interested in the habits practiced by the nuns. Ferr√© traveled throughout Ponce with some of the family's employees, becoming familiar with the neighborhoods and their inhabitants.Ramos et al., p.50-53 When she was young, Ferr√© believed that poverty was a voluntary economic state of being however, during her adolescence she realized that it wasn't so and that she was wrong in her way of thinking.Ramos et al., p.54-55 During this timeframe she practiced tennis and cycling, and taught Catechism.Ramos et al., p.64 Religious career =Novitiate= When she was sixteen years old, Ferr√© enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico's campus in R√≠o Piedras. She subsequently moved to the Orden De Las Siervas Misioneras De La Santisima Trinidad (Congregation Of The Missionary Servants Of The Most Blessed Trinity, MSBT), where she resided while studying. While in the university, Ferr√© developed an interest in opera and literature. She continued practicing tennis, eventually practicing with Rebekah Colberg. Shortly after completing her first semester, Ferr√© returned to her home, where she was informed that her mother was in critical condition. Her mother died the next morning, moments after her son Luis arrived from the United States. Ferr√© resumed her studies with intensively and during this time she also worked and played tennis. Her health was affected because of her strenuous activities and after she went to her doctor and had a radiology done, she was told that she had damage in her lungs and was recommended that she take one year of rest.Ramos et al., p.66 The condition worsened and she moved to Adjuntas briefly, until the symptoms completely disappeared one month later. Jose Ferr√© (her brother) became a member of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n's government. He told her about the details of Operation Bootstrap and Operation Serenity.Ramos et al., p.67 Interested in this second project, she organized a group of delivery boys and shoe shiners and founded a candy distribution system. Ferr√© and some friends also preached to workers in sugar plantations, often visiting their houses in the evening.Ramos et al., p.69 She left her family's house to join a convent shortly after her 21st birthday, after receiving permission from her father.Ramos et al., p.60 Before entering the convent, she decided to swear a chastity vow. After arriving in Philadelphia, she spent her first year involved in a series of religious activities, including some \\"spiritual exercises\\" where she was only allowed to speak in the confessional.Ramos et al., p.82 Her first mission took place in the small town of Norton, Virginia. There she met with the priest of a community of Polish miners and together they performed a series of domestic labors.Ramos et al., p.83 She continued working on other missions, receiving occasional visits from her siblings. She eventually joined a Novitiate in New York City. In this convent, she was one of the few novices that knew how to drive an automobile and served as the convent's driver.Ramos et al., p.92 While in New York, Ferr√© felt symptoms of appendicitis, and was rushed to a Philadelphia hospital. =Work as a nun and Mother Superior= Five years after serving in the missions, Ferrer swore the solemn vows.Ramos et al., p.93 She was subsequently transferred from Long Island to Cabo Rojo per request of Ponce's Bishop. Upon arriving, she was received by a procession. As part of this mission, She and the nuns organized baseball teams and sewing schools.Ramos et al., p.101-102 She continued working in this convent for 11 years, until she was promoted to abbess. As Mother Superior, Ferr√© remained in Cabo Rojo for six more years, which is the time limit that a Mother Superior can work within the a mission before receiving another assignment. She was then sent to Hato Rey, where she was assigned to a religious school.Ramos et al., p.108 Here she replaced part of the institution's materials with new ones, using part of a savings account created by the previous directory. Shortly after she contracted Sepsis, and was removed from the position. Some time later Ferr√© traveled to the Bronx, where several of the nuns that studied with her in Philadelphia resided. This congregation focused their attention in discouraging street crime. One day, Ferr√© was forced to dress a gang member in nun's clothing, to confuse the members of a rival gang. Due to her actions, she was promoted to abbess of the convent.Ramos et al., p.121-122 She led the other nuns in an effort to revitalize the city's landscape. New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller, awarded her the city's \\"Republican Woman\\" recognition.Ramos et al., p.127 The community elected her as their official representative in New York's \\"Committee Against Poverty\\", but she declined the offer and granted the position to another Puerto Rican resident. She did this because Mayor John Lindsay had previously appointed her as his personal representative. Ferr√© focused her work in promoting education among street gangs. The convent, interested in promoting community acceptance regardless of religion, was originally called \\"Dr. White Catholic Center\\" was renamed \\"Dr. White Center\\".Ramos et al., p.128 During this timeframe she continued her education, briefly attending Holly Family College and completing her bachelor's degree at St. Joseph's College for Women. After a stint as a teacher in Philadelphia, she was sent back to New York in order to complete and further her studies. Ferr√© completed a sociology master's degree at Fordham University, submitting a thesis based in the strengths and weaknesses of Puerto Rican families that faced conditions of discrimination and poverty after migrating to the city.Ramos et al., p.146-147 Her final work in the United States took place in Chicago, where she coached a group of Puerto Rican community leaders. =Founding Centros Sor Isolina Ferr√©= In 1968, she returned to Barrio La Playa in Ponce where the Ferr√© family had built a dispensary to treat vesicular conditions.Ramos et al., p.157 She was operated and remained in rest for a month, spending this period visiting adjacent barrios and reading. Ferr√© then began promoting community restructuring by rehabilitating several buildings with the help of her brother Jose. She was responsible for the opening of a small clinic and school named Centro de Orientacion y Servicios de La Playa de Ponce (Ponce Playa Orientation and Services Center), dedicated to providing educational opportunities, extracurricular activities, and day care services to low-income families. With the cooperation of a Methodist reverend, she also founded an industrial sewing school. They also formed a baseball team named Las Latas Stars and an equestrian club.Ramos et al., p.166 Ferr√© promoted cultural events, reestablished traditional celebrations and organized activities focused on theatrics, ballet, modeling and sports. Seeking to address a personnel deficiency in nearby petrochemical factories, Teodoro Moscoso suggested to them the creation of a welding school. The institution was built adjacent to Puerto Rico Iron Works, a company that belonged to the Ferr√© family, and which remained active until 1972.Ramos et al., p.172 This initiative was followed by a photography laboratory, which served to illustrate El Playero, a local magazine.Ramos et al., p.175 Ferr√© and the community of La Playa designed a proposal to work with juvenile delinquents, by suggesting that they should be placed under custody by their community and that they should be treated with respect instead of as criminals. The program was based in a system designed by Charles Grosser named \\"Advocacy\\", eventually becoming known as \\"Advocacy Puerto Rican Style\\".Ramos et al., p.177 This method gathered interest from community leaders in the United States, who were interested in establishing similar programs. The program also gathered interest from politicians, to which she suggested the creation of the Centro Diagnostico y de Tratamiento de la Playa de Ponce (Ponce Playa Diagnostic and Treatment Center). Ferr√© and the community received a grant of one million dollars to build the institution, which was built in a lot in barrio El Cicl√≥n.Ramos et al., p.178 While attempting to eliminate prostitution, Ferr√© rented a building which was once used as a bar, opening a technological center at that location.Ramos et al., p.179-180 In 1975, the Center faced some financial losses, following a fire and a flood, when Hurricane Eloise passed hit Puerto Rico.Ramos et al., p.181-182 By this time a series of small centers had been founded, as part of an initiative that was denominated \\"religious urban guerrilla\\". Due to this the organization's work continued uninterrupted, temporarily moving their operations to a location in an adjacent barrio.Ramos et al., p.225 Ferr√© established the center's headquarters in a building that used to belong to the employees of her father, which had been renamed Dispensario San Antonio years earlier. This was donated to a local convent, who turned it into a corporation in 1950.Ramos et al., p.212 Ferr√© used of her own wealth to created charities not only in Puerto Rico, but in New York City and the Appalachia as well.Sister Isolina Ferre Dies. Associated Press. The Puerto Rico Herald. 3 August 2000. Accessed 27 July 2020. The community of La Playa changed the name of the institution from Centro de Orientacion de La Playa to Centros Sister Isolina Ferr√© to honor her memory.Ramos et al., p.181-182 Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency in charge of the center's publicity, subsequently effected the name change.Ramos et al., p.267 Later years, declining health and death Presidential Medal of Freedom She was elected as a delegate in the \\"World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women\\", organized in 1980. When interviewed, Ferr√© stated that while the organization is run by nuns from the state and donations from the private industry, she tried to keep both of them separated from the church. During the 1980s, most of the funds for Centros Sor Isolina Ferr√© were provided by Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, who promoted the establishment of a new center in Caimito, Puerto Rico.Ramos et al., p.233 One day, Ferr√© decided to intervene in a hostage situation, where two young men were threatening to open fire if the police entered their house. She was able to enter the house and the father confessed that he was responsible for the incident, after he hit one of his sons as punishment.Ramos et al., p.242 The two men used the distraction to escape by jumping to the sea, but went to Ferr√©'s center in search of medical attention. She contacted the police, and convinced them that they would not be arrested if they went to a hospital. This convinced her that the community needed more police attention, eventually employing a Japanese initiative named Koban.Ramos et al., p.243 Based on this, a group of officers moved to one of the residences that comprised Caimito's center, visiting the other houses on a daily basis. When Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico, Centros Sor Isolina Ferr√© cultivated 10,000 trees in a greenhouse, intending to help the government deal with the deforestation left by the storm. One day, Mother Teresa visited Ferr√© while she was preparing an educational initiative.Ramos et al., p.246 Both nuns discussed theology and social and humanitarian work, coming to the conclusion that while they used different methods, their goal was the same. On the morning of July 22, 1985, Ferr√© suffered a heart attack. She remained hospitalized for some weeks before undergoing Cardiac surgery.Ramos et al., p.261 In 1989, she was selected to receive the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism. By the 1990s, the Centers had created 50 different initiatives, of which 40 proved successful.Ramos et al., p.247 In 1993, Ferr√© received the Hispanic Heritage Award in the \\"Education\\" category. In March of that year, Ferr√© organized the first International Congress of Centros Sor Isolina Ferr√©, which focused in community development and youth upbringing. The activity was attended by several religious and political figures.Ramos et al., p.224 That same year, the center also reported that their social programs directed towards juvenile crime had been successful, reducing the frequency of crime in the locations adjacent to the centers by 20 percent.Ramos et al., p.241 Ferr√©'s efforts in La Playa were written and chronicled in Puerto Rican books and newspapers, as well as the publications of other Latin American countries including the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. She earned twelve honorary doctorates from diverse educational institutions, and more than 64 organizations awarded her recognitions.Ramos et al., p.230 Her work was recognized by President Bill Clinton who awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony in the White House, an honor previously also bestowed upon her brother Luis A. Ferr√©. In early 2000, Ferry began experiencing some health problems, but her health improved somewhat that July. However shortly after that she began experiencing respiratory problems and was hospitalized at the Hospital de Damas in Ponce. Ferr√© died on August 3, 2000, shortly before her 87th birthday. By then she had provided over half a century of public service. Her body was buried in Las Mercedes cemetery.Culmina la celebraci√≥n del Centenario de Sister Isolina Ferr√©.

After Ferr√©'s death, the Centers which she founded continued to operate under the direction of Jos√© D√≠az Coto. With help from Puerto Rico's Department of Family and the Department of Justice, preventive programs have been added to the Centers offerings. On May 16, 2008, the institution reported a reduction of 2% in juvenile delinquency in sectors adjacent to its Centers in Ponce.

He was educated at Harvard College and received his Master of Architecture degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. He completed his studies in 1937. The time he spent at Harvard overlapped with arrival of Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus in Germany. Koch served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In April 1944, he was recruited for transfer to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program of the Allied Military Government in the European Theater of Operations, where he served in Germany with other ‚ÄòMonuments Men.‚Äô Career After completing his education, he moved to Sweden where he worked for Sven Markelius for six months. There he blended what he had learned in his formal education with clean Scandinavian design. These influences were evident in his work, especially the Techbuilt homes. Work Koch believed that the American lifestyle would be best served by a housing system which could be easily assembled, disassembled and reconfigured. This passion led him to pioneer prefabrication technologies. His Techbuilt series of homes was designed to be built with prefabricated panels for the walls, floor and roof. =Buildings= His prime legacy is the Techbuilt system of home construction.

Speaking after her 2000 Guineas win in November 2009, Hogan admitted that the purchase was \\"spur of the moment\\", deciding to bid for the filly only after seeing her enter the sale ring. Racing career =Two-year-old season= As a two- year-old, Katie Lee raced six times for two wins and three second placings. She showed a hint of her potential with a three-length win in the Group 3 Eclipse Stakes at Ellerslie on 1 January 2009. Her two-year-old season ended with a disappointing eighth, possibly due to chronic foot problems that plagued her as a two-year-old, in the Karaka Million. =Three-year-old season= Returning as a three-year-old, Katie Lee finished third in the Gold Trail Stakes at Hastings before a spectacular win in the James & Annie Sarten Memorial Stakes at Te Rapa, an increasingly important lead-up race to the 1000 and 2000 Guineas at Riccarton Park. In the 2000 Guineas on 7 November, Katie Lee overcame considerable traffic problems to defeat Military Move and Clapton in the $1,000,000 Group one (G1) event. After the race, co-trainer Graeme Rogerson stated that provided the filly came through the race well, the intention was to back up in the 1000 Guineas seven days later. Sent out as a $1.70 favourite in the 1000 Guineas, Katie Lee again encountered traffic problems in the race before producing yet another outstanding finishing sprint. Runner-up Keep The Peace, a stablemate of 2000 Guineas second placegetter Military Move, provided stiff resistance, but Katie Lee stuck her head out at the finish line to win by the margin of half a neck. Her historic double was made more notable when the runners-up in each of the races went on to win the New Zealand Derby and New Zealand Oaks respectively. Katie Lee followed her Guineas victories with a second at Group 3 level, before a Group 2 win in the Eight Carat Classic at Ellerslie on Boxing Day and a second in the Group 2 Royal Stakes at the same venue on New Year's Day. She then ran third in the Desert Gold Stakes at Trentham before winning the Group 2 Sir Tristram Fillies Classic at Te Rapa. Katie Lee's connections attempted to make further history in seeking a rare victory for a filly in the New Zealand Derby, but a mixture of a tough and long campaign and the 2,400 metres of the Derby meant she was unable to perform as expected, finishing 14th. =Four- year-old season= The start of Katie Lee's four-year-old campaign was delayed by wet tracks, with her first run resulting in a third placing at Ruakaka on 18 September. She bounced back to winning form at her second start back, winning the Group 3 Traderacks Stakes (formerly G.R.Kelt Memorial) at Hastings on 2 October, putting in a similar run to her two Guineas victories. After a series of performances in which she was well below her best regardless of an unfavourable track, Katie Lee was officially retired on 16 August 2011 and joins the ranks of top class broodmares.

The town was formerly known as Upsettlington, but King James IV of Scotland renamed the town Ladykirk; the church is also known as St Mary's Church or Kirk of Steill. Ladykirk stands directly opposite Norham Castle, Northumberland, England In history Ladykirk Church, the Kirk of Steill, was built by James IV of Scotland =John Balliol= The land opposite Norham Castle known as Upsettlington Green and Holywell Haugh was used for meetings during the wars of Scottish Independence. Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, the father of Robert the Bruce, and the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland convened at Holywell Haugh on 2 June 1291, and met Robert Burnell the English Bishop of Bath and Wells. On the following day John Balliol acknowledged Edward I of England as his feudal superior.Tytler, Patrick Fraser, History of Scotland, vol.1 (1841), pp.73-4: Rymer, Foedera, vol.2, p.551 =James IV= Nave of Ladykirk Church James IV established his headquarters at Upsettlington on 5 August 1497 during an attack on Norham Castle. Here James played cards with the Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala. The approach of an English army led by the Earl of Surrey forced James to abandon the siege of Norham. Surrey marched towards Ayton Castle and by 21 August 1497 peace was negotiated and James sent orders to stop re-inforcements coming to Ayton.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 1 (1877), pp. clvi-clvii. Soon after, James IV built a new church called Our Lady Kirk of Steill at Upsettlington. Originally, the church served two parishes, Horndene and Upsettlington.There were remains of another building called the 'chapel park' north of Upsettlington in the 19th-century, New Abridged Statistical Account (1857), p.198 fn. citing Fullarton's Gazetteer; this has been suggested to be the site of the earlier 'Wester Upsettlington' church, see RCAHMS Canmore It is said that James founded the new church in gratitude for his safe crossing of the River Tweed, or to commemorate the siege of Norham Castle in 1497 and its peaceful conclusion. An inscription already illegible by the late 18th-century recorded that the church was founded by James in 1500, marking the Christian jubilee year.R. Lambe, ed., An exact and circumstantial history of the battle of Floddon. In verse, (London 1774). p. 95 (n. 349) The building was first supervised by Sir Patrick Blacader from 1500 when he was allocated ¬£40 from wool customs for the construction,G. Burnett, ed., Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, vol.11 (Edinburgh 1888), p.276 and then from 1504 onwards by George Ker of Samuelston, by which time the windows were being glazed. James IV visited in August 1501, and a church organ was brought for this occasion. Payments for the Kirk were listed in the royal accounts under the same 'buildings' heading as for the king's palaces and the ships of the Royal Scots Navy.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 2, (1900), lxxiii-lxxxiv, 116-7, 280. A chasuble embroidered with the royal arms, with an alb, and an altar frontal of arras- work were provided in March 1505, and the building work continued.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (1901), 78-79. In legend, the foundation of the church became associated with visits of James IV to Lady Heron of Ford, and the defeat of the Scottish army at Flodden.R. Lambe, ed., An exact and circumstantial history of the battle of Floddon. In verse, (London 1774). p. 95 (n. 349) Subsequently, the church was an important meeting place on the border. James gave the lands of Upsettlington and Holywell, with fishing rights, and the patronage of the new church to Alexander Lord Home. Lord Home had been the patron of the previous church.Register of the Great Seal, vol. 2 (1882), p. 433 no. 2050, p. 729 no. 3406 In the 16th-century fishing rights at Holywell were disputed between Lord Home and the English Norham castle. =Later sixteenth century= East end of the church The Earl of Angus and his allies Lord Home, Lord Livingstone and John (Red-Bag) Somerville of Cambusnethan met at the Kirk of Steill in 1521. They were leaving Scotland to avoid Regent Albany their political rival who had returned from France. Angus sent his uncle, the poet Gavin Douglas to Cardinal Wolsey from Ladykirk on 13 December 1521.Ellis, Henry, ed., Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 3rd Series, vol.1, Richard Bentley, London (1846) 287-294. The gentlemen of Selkirk, Jedburgh and Duns were summoned to meet Mary of Guise at Ladykirk on 24 November 1551, as she returned from France.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. x, (1913), xvi, 33. The 15th century church and village are known as the place where a treaty supplemental to the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis was signed by the English and Scottish commissioners. The Treaty of Upsettlington, May 1559, (as it is known) was concluded within the Lady Kirk and exchanged at the church of Norham in England. The commissioners of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis II of France were the Earl of Morton, Alexander, Lord Hume, Henry Sinclair, Dean of Glasgow and James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour. The English commission included the Earl of Northumberland and the Bishop of Durham.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 212-214: Foedera, vol. 15, 520 See also *Ladykirk and Norham Bridge *List of places in the Scottish Borders *List of places in Scotland *List of places in Northumberland *List of places in England Footnotes Sources *Brooke, C J (2000) Safe sanctuaries: security and defence in Anglo-Scottish border churches 1290‚Äì1690, Edinburgh; Pages 10, 18‚Äì21, 31, 63, 126, 219, 306, 360‚Äì1, 365.

Kasugamycin was discovered by Hamao Umezawa, who also discovered kanamycin and bleomycin, as a drug that prevent growth of a fungus causing rice blast disease. It was later found to inhibit bacterial growth also. It exists as a white, crystalline substance with the chemical formula C14H28ClN3O10 (kasugamycin hydrochloride). It is also known as kasumin. Mechanism of action Like many of the known natural antibiotics, kasugamycin inhibits proliferation of bacteria by tampering with their ability to make new proteins, the ribosome being the major target. Kasugamycin inhibits protein synthesis at the step of translation initiation. Kasugamycin inhibition is thought to occur by direct competition with initiator transfer RNA. Recent experiments suggest that kasugamycin indirectly induces dissociation of P-site-bound fMet-tRNAfMet from 30S subunits through perturbation of the mRNA, thereby interfering with translation initiation. Kasugamycin specifically inhibits translation initiation of canonical but not of leaderless mRNA. For initiation on leaderless mRNA, the overlap between mRNA and kasugamycin is reduced and the binding of tRNA is further stabilized by the presence of the 50S subunit, minimizing Ksg efficacy. Kasugamycin also induces the formation of unusual 61S ribosomes in vivo, which are proficient in selectively translating leaderless mRNA. 61S particles are stable and are devoid of more than six proteins of the small subunit, including the functionally important proteins S1 and S12. Structural basis for kasugamycin action The structure of the kasugamycin-70S ribosome complex from Escherichia coli has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 3.5-A resolution. The drug binds within the messenger RNA channel of the 30S subunit between the universally conserved G926 and A794 nucleotides in 16S ribosomal RNA, which are sites of kasugamycin resistance. The kasugamycin binding sites are present on top of helix 44 (h44), spanning the region between h24 and h28, which contacts the conserved nucleotides A794 and G926. Neither binding position overlaps with P-site tRNA. Instead, kasugamycin mimics the codon nucleotides at the P and E sites by binding within the path of the mRNA, thus perturbing the mRNA-tRNA codon-anticodon interaction. Resistance Low level resistance to kasugamycin is acquired by mutations in the 16S rRNA methyltransferase KsgA which methylates the nucleotides A1518 and A1519 in 16S rRNA. Spontaneous ksgA mutations conferring a modest level of resistance to kasugamycin occur at a high frequency of 10‚àí6. Once cells acquire the ksgA mutations, they produce high-level kasugamycin resistance at an extraordinarily high frequency (100-fold greater frequency than that observed in the ksgA+ strain). Surprisingly, kasugamycin resistance mutations do not inhibit binding of the drug to the ribosome. Present structural and biochemical results indicate that inhibition by kasugamycin and kasugamycin resistance are closely linked to the structure of the mRNA at the junction of the peptidyl-tRNA and exit-tRNA sites (P and E sites).

The Australian Senate used the term specifically when reporting on its 2003‚Äì2004 \\"Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care\\".Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children, Australian Senate Community Affairs References Committee (August 2004)‚Äì Executive Summary Children ended up in out-of-home care for a variety of reasons, mainly relating to poverty and family breakdown at a time when there was little support for families in crisis. Residential institutions run by government and non-government organisations were the standard form of out-of- home care during the first half of the 20th century. Children in institutions were sometimes placed in foster homes for short periods, weekends or during holiday periods. There was a move towards smaller group care from the 1950s and a move away from institutional care to kinship and foster care from the 1970s. Some Australian state governments have funded redress schemes for adults who were abused in care. In 2009 an official Australian government apology was made to people who had grown up in the institutional system, including former child migrants to Australia. The apology was made by then Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Many of these children suffered from neglect and were abused physically, emotionally or sexually while in care. Survivors to this day still suffer the effects of the child abuse. The trauma experienced in care has affected care leavers negatively throughout their adult lives. Their partners and children have also felt the impact, which can then flow through to future generations. Who are the forgotten Australians? The people sometimes called Forgotten Australians are the survivors of government policies that resulted in at least 500,000 children growing up in 'out-of-home' care in Australia in the 20th Century. Forgotten Australians are also known as 'Care Leavers'. Other terms for people who spent time in out-of-home care include 'homies', 'state wards' or 'wardies'. The majority of children in care were not orphans. Many had either one or both parents still living, or other living relatives. Children spent varying amounts of time in institutions and foster care and the majority entered care at a young age. Many spent their entire childhood and youth in an orphanage or children's home. The Australian Senate used the figure of half-a-million when reporting on its 2003‚Äì04 'Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care'. The Senate's 2004 report on the inquiry began by saying that 'Upwards of, and possibly more than 500,000 Australians experienced care ... during the last century'. The 500,000 includes 450,000-plus Australian-born, non-indigenous children, 30,000‚Äì50,000 Indigenous children from the Stolen Generations, and 7,000 Former Child Migrants from Britain, Ireland and Malta. Following a 1995 Senate inquiry into the removal of Indigenous children from their families, non-Indigenous people who had experienced out-of-home care as children called themselves the 'forgotten Australians' and lobbied for similar recognition. When a Senate inquiry into child migration to Australia was being conducted in 2000‚Äì2001, the recently established Care Leavers Australia Network (CLAN) made a submission to that inquiry to raise awareness that a third and much larger group of children who had experienced care were being forgotten. A third Senate inquiry was conducted in 2003‚Äì04. The Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care 'directed its inquiries primarily to those affected children who were not covered by the 2001 report Lost Innocents: Righting the Record, inquiring into child migrants, and the 1997 report, Bringing them Home, inquiring into Aboriginal children'. The Senate reported on the inquiry in 2004, using the term 'forgotten Australians' in the report title and stating: > ... children were for many reasons hidden in institutions and forgotten by > society when they were placed in care and again when they were released into > the 'outside' world. ... These people who spent part or all of their > childhood in an institution, children's home or out-of-home care background > have been the forgotten Australians. The term Forgotten Australians is controversial. It sometimes refers to all Australian children, including Indigenous children and former child migrants to Australia who spent part or all of their childhoods in care during the 20th Century, particularly between 1920 and 1970. Not all Australians accept the term \\"Forgotten Australians\\" because of its connotations of passivity and because the label was supplied by the Senate Committee without consultation. Certainly many Indigenous people and Child Migrants prefer other more descriptive terminology. Why children were placed in out-of-home care Many of the reasons children were placed in care related to poverty and family breakdown. Until social change came about in Australia in the 1970s, there was almost no community or government support for families in crisis or financial need so most children whose families could not care for them were placed in some form of out-of-home care. Family breakdown as a result of divorce, desertion, death, illness, domestic violence, drunkenness or the trauma of war led to children being taken into care or being placed in care by their own families.'Let our histories be visible': Human rights museology and the National Museum of Australia's Inside: Life in Children's Homes and Institutions, by Alele Chynoweth, reCollections, National Museum of Australia, Volume 7 Number 1 Few women who had been widowed, deserted or divorced could afford to raise children. Work opportunities were fewer for women than men, and women were paid less than the male wage for the same work. Lone mothers and fathers found it difficult to work to support children as there was little affordable childcare available.You Can't Forget Things Like That, Forgotten Australians and Former Child Migrants Oral History Project, National Library of Australia. The social stigma of giving birth outside marriage placed enormous pressure on women to give their children up for adoption. Some chose to place their children in a home so that they could at least have some contact with them. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were removed from their families as part of the assimilation policies of the time, and British and Maltese child migrants brought to Australian under child migration schemes spent their childhoods in institutions. Children could be made state wards by being charged with 'being neglected, of no fixed abode, [or] likely to lapse into a life of crime or vice', if authorities considered they came from homes where there was violence or alcohol abuse or if there was no-one to properly take care of them. Children with physical or mental disabilities were also commonly placed in institutions, as were children who were deemed to be 'uncontrollable'. Types of care =Institutional care= Since the early days of the British colony in Australia placing 'at risk' children into orphanages and children's homes was normal policy. During the first half of the 20th century, residential institutions were still the standard form of out-of-home care. Institutions were run by state governments, charities, welfare and religious organisations or private individuals. They included orphanages and children's homes, as well as industrial or training schools. There were at least 800 of these institutions operating between the 1920s and the 1980s. They varied in size from large institutions housing several hundred children to 'cottages' within the grounds of an institution where smaller groups of children were cared for by 'cottage parents'. Orphanages and children's homes in Australia 'from the 1920s to 1980s were under-resourced, poorly supervised and lacked government scrutiny'.Life in Children's Homes and Institutions ‚Äì Trauma, National Museum of Australia By the 1950s, concerns about the level of care children were receiving in institutions led to the closing down of some larger orphanages and children's homes and a move towards group care in smaller cottage and foster homes. The child protection sector became increasingly professional and accountable following changes to child protection policy during the 1970s and 1980s and there was a move away from institutionalised care towards kinship and foster care.The Experiences of Women Forgotten Australians and Care Leavers ‚Äì A Literature Review, Jasmin Ebbels, Women's Centre for Health Matters, 2011Protecting Vulnerable Children: A National Challenge(2005) ‚Äì Chapter 3: Out-of-home care ‚Äì Foster Children =Foster care= Foster care in Australia began in the 19th century as a form of boarding out to give children in institutions an experience of 'normal' family life.Supporting Strong Parenting in the Australian Foster Care Sector, Australian Foster Care Association (2001), pp.11‚Äì12 Care leavers reported to the Senate Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care that they had been placed in foster homes for short periods, weekends or during holiday periods. Foster care placements do not appear to have been made in a coordinated way, but 'with expediency rather than child welfare being a primary consideration'. Many reported being placed with people with limited experience of children or with older couples. Some considered they had only been fostered as a form of cheap labour to help out on farms and as domestic servants. Sexual abuse by foster parents, their children or other relatives was also reported.Forgotten Australians report (August 2004), Chapter 4 ‚Äì Treatment and care of children in institutions: 4.72 and 4.93 Treatment Children's experience of out-of- home care varied. However, even those who made positive comments to the 2003‚Äì04 Senate Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care reported a 'lack of love, affection and nurturing'. The Senate inquiry documented details of abuse and neglect of children in institutions: > The Committee received hundreds of graphic and disturbing accounts about the > treatment and care experienced by children in out-of-home care ... Their > stories outlined a litany of emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and often > criminal physical and sexual assault ... neglect, humiliation and > deprivation of food, education and healthcare.Forgotten Australians report > (August 2004), Appendix 7 ‚Äì Date in care and forms of abuse described by > care leavers in submissions Details of the mistreatment and abuse that emerged in submissions to the Senate inquiry include: * physical assault and sexual abuse by 'carers' or other children and visitors * inadequate medical and dental care * unethical use as test subjects of experimental medication and drugsForgotten Australians report (August 2004), Chapter 4 ‚Äì Treatment and care of children in institutions * extreme physical hardship * lack of healthy food and adequate clothing * inadequate accommodation * harsh and sometimes humiliating punishment. Long-term impacts Care leavers lives have been shaped in many different ways by their time in out-of-home care. The long-term impacts are generally 'negative and destructive'.Forgotten Australians report (August 2004), Chapter 6 ‚Äì Life long impact of out of home care: 6.1 =Common experiences= Common feelings reported by care leavers include feelings of abandonment and loss because of separation from parents and siblings; a sense of isolation; feelings of guilt and self-blame; lack of confidence and low self-esteem.Care Leavers, Australian Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Care leavers reported to the Senate Inquiry that as adults they had suffered depression, social anxieties, phobias, recurring nightmares, anger, shame, and were fearful and distrustful of others leading to an inability to form and maintain relationships. Many detailed drug and alcohol dependence, homelessness, unemployment and imprisonment.Parliament of Australia, Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs, Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care: Submissions received =Loss of identity= The most common outcome of a childhood spent in out-of- home care reported to the Senate inquiry was a loss of identity. Many children in care were untruthfully told that their parents were dead or had abandoned them. It was common policy to prevent parents from visiting. Parents were often told their children had been moved to other institutions or had been adopted, or that visiting rights had been withdrawn as punishment for misbehaviour. In later life, some people discovered letters on government and institution files showing that their parents had tried to make contact, or have them returned home. Siblings taken into care together were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so brothers and sisters rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained at home with their parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This makes it difficult for older care leavers to find out why and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives. =Poor education outcomes= Education for children in institutions was often of a poor standard and by the age of 15 most children had left school. Many children left institutions with low levels of literacy and numeracy that may have affected their ability to find work or meant they could only get low paying jobs. It also affected their ability to further their education. =Impact on partners and children= Most care leavers left the care system without any preparation for adulthood or parenthood. Many have carried the trauma of neglect and abuse into their adult lives and relationships but have found it difficult to tell anyone about their experiences, even partners and children. Some reported finding it difficult to sustain relationships and many have had several partners or only transient relationships. Many care leavers found they were unable to be good parents or have chosen not to have children. Apologies =National apology= On Monday 16 November 2009, the Australian Parliament, through then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and then Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull, formally acknowledged and apologised for the harsh treatment and ongoing trauma of Forgotten Australians and former child migrants. The apology was streamed live and broadcast on national television. Over 900 Forgotten Australians and former child migrants were present in the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra to hear the apology. =Other apologies= State governments and past providers of institutional and other out-of-home care have formally apologised to care leavers who suffered or witnessed abuse or neglect while in care. In 2009, the University of Melbourne apologised for their involvement in the unethical use of orphans as test subjects of experimental medication and drugs.\\"96710 17-11-2009 Glyn Davis to All Staff - Our apology to Forgotten Australians\\" Major reports The Queensland Government commissioned an inquiry which was tabled in parliament in June 1999. The inquiry was conducted by Leneen Forde and is known as the 'Forde Inquiry'. It investigated abuse of tens of thousands of individuals in 159 institutions from 1911 to 1999. The Senate Community Affairs Committee commissioned a national report on children in institutional care in 2003, specifically excluding child migrants ('Home Children') and Aboriginal children, who were the subject of previous reports. The Forgotten Australians inquiry considered the plight of more than 500,000 children in care in the 20th century and 'generated the largest volume of highly personal, emotive and significant evidence of any Senate inquiry'. The South Australian Government's 'Children In State Care Commission Of Inquiry' considered the more serious 'allegations of sexual abuse and death from criminal conduct' from 1910 to 2004. The resulting report (the 'Mullighan Report') noted that 792 people made allegations of abuse by 1,733 perpetrators and that 'Using available records, the inquiry found that 242 people ‚Äî 124 males and 118 females ‚Äî were children in State care at the time of the alleged abuse'.'Children in State Care Commission of Inquiry: Allegations of Sexual Abuse and Death from Criminal Conduct (Mullighan Report) ‚Äì Summary, p.xi The names of 924 children alleged to have died while in state care in South Australia were given to the inquiry. The inquiry found that 391 children had died while in state care.'Children in State Care Commission of Inquiry: Allegations of Sexual Abuse and Death from Criminal Conduct (Mullighan Report) ‚Äì Summary, p.xx All the reports considered the nature and severity of abuse and it consequences on the abused. Each report made dozens of recommendations to address the problems caused by past abuse and prevent future abuse of children in care. Redress schemes State government funded redress schemes have made or are planning ex-gratia payments to Forgotten Australians in some states. In Queensland, payments were made in 2009 ranging from $7,000 to $40,000. In Western Australia, payments were expected to range from $10,000 to $80,000 and were to be made in 2010. The maximum payment may be limited because of underfunding. New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia are yet to fund redress schemes. The Victorian Government position is that individual cases will be addressed on their merits. The major problem for adult survivors of childhood abuse is the burden of proof of the abuse in a formal legal setting.

He was the son of Leonid Pavlovich Sabaneyev, a famous hunting expert, and his brother Boris was also a musician. Biography Leonid Sabaneyev was born in Moscow in 1881 and his musical studies were under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Sergei Taneyev, Nikolai Zverev and Paul de Schl√∂zer at the Moscow Conservatory. He graduated in mathematics and physics from Moscow University in 1908. He wrote some early works, such as incidental music to King Oedipus (1889), a Funeral March in Memory of Beethoven, two trios (including a Trio-Impromptu for violin, cello and piano, Op. 4),UR Research piano pieces (including a Piano Sonata, Op. 15) and songs. He then made a special study of Alexander Scriabin, and became an authority on that composer (see synthetic chord). His first book on Scriabin was published in 1916. In addition to his own original works, he transcribed Scriabin's Prometheus: The Poem of Fire for 2 pianos. He founded the Moscow Institute of Musicology. He was both a conservative and a progressive; his ideas included a scale comprising 53 notesPenn State and hoped to create a \\"Laboratory of the Exact Science of Music\\". Sabaneyev famously embarrassed himself in 1915 by publishing a scathing review of the premiere of Sergei Prokofiev's Scythian Suite ‚Äì a performance that had actually been canceled at the last minute. This prompted a response from Prokofiev stating that the supposed performance must have been a product of Sabaneyev's imagination, as the only copy of the score was in the composer's hands and thus the critic had not even been able to see it. However, later Prokofiev said that Sabaneyev had information about the Suite from his friends who had already heard the Suite and he probably wouldn't have changed a word in his review even if he had heard it in concert.Prokofiev \\"Autobiography\\": p. 256-57 Sabaneyev left Russia in 1926, after publishing Scriabin (1916, 2/1923), History of Russian Music (1924), The General History of Music (1925), and Music After October (on post- revolution music in Russia). History of Russian Music was translated into German (1926) and received very positive reviews from critics such as Maurice Cauchie.jstor In his later years he lived in Paris, London, the United States, and Nice, where he is buried. His musicological works from this period include Modern Russian Composers (1927), a monograph on Taneyev (1930), and Music for the Films (1935). His students in Paris included the Swedish composers Dag Wir√©n and G√∂sta Nystroem. His later musical works included a ballet, a symphonic poem, and the oratorio The Revelation of St John (1940). He also wrote Variations on a Theme of Scriabin, for unknown forces. He also had several science works on mathematics and zoology.See V. L.

It is bounded by the Nyhavn canal, Kongens Nytorv, Holmens Kanal, Niels Juels Gade and the waterfront along Havnegade. For centuries, the area was the site of the Royal Naval Shipyard, known as Bremerholm, but after the naval activities relocated to Nyholm (Danish: The New Islet), it came under residential redevelopment in the 1860s and 1870s. The new neighbourhood was planned by Ferdinand Meldahl and has also been referred to as \\"Meldahl's Nine Streets\\". Apart from the buildings which face Kongens Nytorv, which include the Royal Danish Theatre and Charlottenborg Palace, the area is characterized by homogeneous Historicist architecture consisting of perimeter blocks with richly decorated house fronts. History =Bremerholm= Bremerholm in the 1620s, detail from engracing by Hugo Allard The area now known Gammelholm was originally a small island in the strait between Copenhagen and Amager, which became known as Bremerholm, probably named for the presence there of merchants and ship builders from Bremen, or simply as Holmen (Danish: The Islet). In the beginning of the 16th century land reclamations annexed the island to Zealand and in 1510, under the reign of Hans of Denmark, a naval shipyard was established in the area. A ropewalk at the site is first mentioned in 1555 and an anchor forge was built in 1563. When King Christian IV commenced his modernization of the fortifications of Copenhagen, he extended the city's East Rampart, taking it straight through Bremerholm to the beach. The moat in front of the rampart was later expanded to form the Holmen Canal, which was constructed as a new harbour for the Royal Fleet, replacing the Arsenal Harbour further south. In the first decades of the 17th century, Christian IV also built a considerable amount of housing for higher-ranked naval personnel at Bremerholm. This prompted a demand for a naval church, leading to the conversion of the anchor forge, now located on the far side of the Holmen Canal, into the Church of Holmen. In 1631 the barracks at Bremerholm were supplemented by Nyboder in the far north of Copenhagen which was built to satisfy the demand for housing for lower-ranked crew members of the nacy's vessels. Around the same time, a large prison was inaugurated at Bremerholm. Much of the hard work in the shipyards was based on forced labour carried out by convicts from the facility. =On the King's New Square= Bremerholm in 1728 When Kongens Nytorv, the King's New Square, was established in 1670 and connected to the waterfront along Bremerholm's northern margin by the Nyhavn canal, it meant that the city moved closer to the Royal Shipyard. In the years around 1780, Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve built a large palatial mansion on the corner of the square and the canal, the later Charlottenborg Palace, and Caspar Frederik Harsdorff built a house on a neighbouring site, Harsdorff's House, which was to serve as a model for other town houses in the city. The rope walk came to mark the boundary between the square and rest of Bremerholm. =The Old and New Islets= Naval ships at Gammelholm In 1690, the Royal Naval Shipyard moved across the harbour to Nyholm, the New Islet, a newly reclaimed area north of Christianshavn, although a number of activities and facilities remained at Bremerholm which from that on became known as Gammelholm, the Old Islet. Together, Gammelholm and Nyholm remained for a long time the largest employer in Denmark. Gammelholm in c. 18401900 In 1778 the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden relocated from Amaliegade to the garden behind Charlottenborg Palace. It was at Gammelholm that the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 broke out. It began in a coal and timber storage and spread along, jumped across the Canal of Holmen and spread to the area around St. Nicolas' Church before moving along Gammel Strand to the area around Gammeltorv and Nytorv. =Residential redevelopment= Gammelholm viewed from the water between 1890 and 1900 In 1859 the Navy decommissioned their last operations at Gammelholm, and the area came under redevelopment as a residential neighbourhood according to a masterplan created by Ferdinand Meldahl. At the same time the Canal of Holmen was filled and converted into a prominent new street. Construction in the area began in 1861 and was completed in 1876. Apart from the residential buildings, a number of new institutions and companies also settled in the area. A new building for the Royal Danish Theatre, which had been located nearby since 1754, was built on the corner of Kongens Nytorv and the filled Holmens Kanal. A new building designed by Meldahl and Ludvig Fenger for the Royal Mint was completed in 1873 on land which was previously part Botanical Garden which had left the area in 1879. Architecture Gammelholm was planned with broad streets inspired by Paris, an inspiration Meldahl also relied on elsewhere, such as at S√∏torvet. Typically of the time, the residential buildings were not designed by architects but the master builders who constructed them. The area was built up with perimeter blocks with elegant, richly decorated Historicist fronts facing the street but drab, grey rear sides. lots were sold at very high prices and developers therefore utilized space to the utmost. In the courtyards extra buildings, without direct access to the streets, were constructed to a grey, and humble design, often only two metres apart. These 'rear houses' were demolished in the 1970s to make way for courtyard gardens. Gammelholm today Tordenskjoldsgade viewed from the passageway beteeth St√¶rekassen Gammelholm is today a quiet residential neighbourhood. Even the boundary facing the otherwise lively Nyhavn canal is known as the 'quiet side of Nyhavn'. Holberggade is the principal street which penetrates the area, while it most notable individual buildings are to be found along Kongens Nytorv. These include the Royal Danish Theatre and St√¶rekassen and Charlottenborg Palace. Future development Two under construction projects are likely to revitalize the area in the near future: * Plans to transform Havnegade into a promenade to revitalize the area was but the project was put on hold due to budget cuts in October 2008. In the spring of 2011 construction of the project finally began and it is expected to be completed in December 2011. * A pedestrian and cyclist bridge from Havnegade next to Nyhavn and across the harbour is planned. Eliminating the current cul-de-sac created by the unbridged mouth of Nyhavn will create more life along the quiet side of Nyhavn as well as along Havnegade. An architectural competition was settled in 2009, and the bridge is due to open in 2013. Transport Kongens Nytorv metro station, served by both lines M1 and M2 of the Copenhagen Metro, is located in front of Magasin du Nord at Kongens Nytorv, just outside the Gammelholm area. A number of bus routes also stop at Kongens Nytorv next to the metro station. The 904 line of the Copenhagen Harbour Buses stop at Christian IV's Bro at the mouth of Slotsholmens Canal, at the southern end of Havnegade and close to the Church of Holmen.

D. Museum, is a museum of Indian sculptures, bronzes, manuscripts, paintings, drawings, miniature paintings, woodwork, bead work and ancient and contemporary coins in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. History Since its inception in 1956, the L. D. Institute of Indology has been collecting and preserving rare manuscripts and artifacts of various kinds, some of which are handed over to the L.D. Museum. The Museum is the product of the vision and energy of two remarkable persons who were responsible for its establishment: Muni Punyavijayaji, an erudite monk scholar and Sheth Kasturbhai Lalbhai, the well-known industrialist of Ahmedabad. As the collection grew over the years, the Board of Trustees (of the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Bharatiya Sanskriti Vidyamandir), felt strongly the need for a separate museum building to house the display of its collection. Consequently, a new museum building was built adjacent to the existing building of the Institute, which was also designed by the internationally acclaimed architect, Balkrishna Doshi. The collection in the new museum building was opened to the public in 1984 and was formally inaugurated by Braj Kumar Nehru (Governor of Gujarat) in 1985. Location The Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum of the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Bharatiya Sanskriti Vidya Mandir is located in the premises of the L.D. Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad. It is situated on a sprawling campus in the western part of the city in an area dotted with educational and research institutes, and in the vicinity of Gujarat University and L.D. College of Engineering. It is about 7 kilometers from the Railway Station and 12 kilometers from the Airport. Therefore, it is easily accessible from any part of the Ahmedabad city. Timings The museum is open on all days, except on Mondays and public holidays, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Collections The wide-ranging sculpture collection is unique, since all the major regional styles of the sub-continent are represented here on the Ground Floor, in Madhuri D. Desai Gallery. The outstanding pieces include the largest head of Buddha (c. 5th century) in stucco from Gandhara, the earliest cult image of Lord Rama (early 6th century) Gupta period from Deogarh (Madhya Pradesh), a rare figure of Matrika Indrani (6th century) from Shamlaji (Gujarat), the Adinath bronze image (c.7th-8th century) from Sirpur (near Nandurbar, Maharashtra), the Jaina bronze images from Ghogha (Dist.Bhavnagar, Gujarat) and some of the finest examples of Buddha images from Mathura, Nalanda and Nepal/ Tibet. Besides, the Madhuri D. Desai Gallery includes some very superb Chola sculptures (c. 10th-12th century) from Tamil Nadu. A majestic group of four Tirthankaras from Ladol dating between 11th and 13th centuries are displayed in Chaumukha arrangement. There are also in display 9 portrait statues of distinguished personages from Gujarat during the medieval period, which includes the Solanki king, Jayasimha Siddharaja. The portraits are inscribed with the date of V.S.1285 = 1228 (that is, during the Vaghela period) and the find spot is Harij, near Patan. The Museum has one of the finest collections of paintings in the Gujarati Jaina styles, some of which are painted before the Mughal period and are displayed in the Muni Punyavijayaji Gallery on the 1st Floor. The collection, which was assembled by the Muniji during the 1940s, has some rare illustrated wooden book covers (patli) created for palm-leaf manuscripts. The Jaina pilgrimage painting on cloth executed in 1433 at Champaner (Gujarat) is the earliest extant example of such a painting on cloth. Similarly, a Vijnaptipatra painted at Agra by the Mughal painter, Ustad Salivahana, in 1610, is the earliest painted document of its kind. It refers to the Mughal emperor Jahangir's farman prohibiting the killing of animals in his empire during the Jaina festival of Paryushana. The earliest painted paper manuscript of the Shantinath Charitra, dated V.S.1453 = 1396. has been recognized as a global treasure by UNESCO. Other exceptional examples on show include, the illustrated manuscripts of the Kalakacharya Katha (c. 1430) in Mandu style, the Matar Sangrahani Sutra (dated 1583), painted by Chitara Govinda, the Shripala Rasa (18th century), and painted Vijnapatipatra from Ahmedabad (dated 1796) in the late Gujarati style; several rare cosmological diagrams called Adhidvipa (c. 1440) and the Jaina Siddha- Chakra-Yantra. On the 1st floor, eastern wing of the Muni Punyavijayaji Gallery has been designed with a section displaying the Leelavati Lalbhai Wood work Collection. It highlights the age old tradition of wood carving in Gujarat and other parts of India, mostly donated by Smt. Leelavati Lalbhai. The display includes Jaina Derasara, relief panels of Tirthankaras and other symbolic forms, carved pillars and decorative panels. Among the noteworthy objects on display from the Shri Arvindbhai Collection, are a flamboyant Chola style Nataraja (11th century), an exuberant Nepali/ Tibetan bronze Mandala (18th century) and an elaborately decorated Chinese/ Japanese style cupboard in wood. This gift has widened the scope of the various collections to grow into a Museum of Asian Art in the Gujarat region. Kasturbhai Lalbhai Collection of Indian Drawings comprises over 1855 Indian drawings and unfinished paintings. They represent most of the schools of Indian miniature paintings. Initially the collection was formed nearly 1000 years ago and now it is on display with the same objective of understanding the technical and the creative processes of traditional Indian miniature paintings. This substantial collection is represented here by a display of several dozen exquisite drawings of Indian miniature paintings belonging to various regional schools, between 17th and 19th centuries. The significant themes on view are Ramayana series and other numerous subjects. The entire eastern wing on the first floor of Museum building was renovated with the financial assistance received from Ministry of Culture, New Delhi, 2012-2013. On the south-eastern side of the renovated wing, Priyakant T. Munshaw Gallery of Coinage has on display a representative collection of historical phases of coinage of India, which was posthumously gifted by Smt. Nandiniben Munshaw in 2013 The collection includes the earliest punched-marked coins called bentbar (c. 600 BC), Akbar's Din-i-Ilahi coin, Jahangir's Zodiac series in silver, Adil Shah's Larin (dated 1668) and contemporary currency. On the north-western side of the First Floor, the Muni Punyavijayaji Gallery has a section devoted to Gopi- Anand Bead Work Collection. The art of Moti Guthana or Moti Poravanu is practiced mainly at Saurashtra and Kutch regions of Gujarat. This art has been in vogue since centuries but became wide spread during the late 19th century These patterns have been mostly used for household decoration and marriage ceremonies. Women of Kathi community in Gujarat have mastery over this art- form, who are fond of engaging in bead work for their domestic applications as well. The Gopi-Anand Bead Work Collection has been gifted to the Museum by Shri Mahesh and Smt. Usha Pandya (March 2013), in memory of his parents, Shri Dalpatram and Gopiben Pandya. This interesting material augments the Museum's holdings with a representative group of Gujarati handicrafts. Galleries The invaluable collections over the period have enriched the Museum through generous permanent gifts by illustrious group of donors. To acknowledge those contributors and as tribute to their memory, the various galleries and sections in the museum have been named after them, like, (1) Muni Punyavijayaji Gallery (2) Madhuri D. Desai Gallery (3) Kasturbhai Lalbhai Collection of Indian Drawings (4) Leelavati Lalbhai Woodwork Collection (5) Arvind Lalbhai Collection (6) Priyakant T. Munshaw Gallery of Coinage (7) Gopi-Anand Beadwork Collection. Conservation Laboratory The modest Conservation laboratory of the Museum has facilities for conservation of miniature paintings on paper. Preliminary surface cleaning of stone sculptures and metal objects is also carried out here. Art Reference Library Museum also have in house Art Reference Library. Over the past decades an Art Reference Library (including rare books) has grown in the Museum's basement with donation of books, further enhanced with financial assistance received from Ministry of Culture, New Delhi, 2012-2013.

She was built for Cunard White Star Line in 1947 as the cargo liner Media. In 1961 she was sold to Italy, rebuilt as an ocean liner and renamed Flavia. In 1969, she was refitted as a cruise ship and renamed Flavian. In 1982 she was sold to Panama and renamed Lavia. She was undergoing a refit when the fire occurred. The damage to her was so great that she was scrapped. History =Media= Media was built by John Brown & Company, Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. She was yard number 629 and was launched on 12 December 1946, with completion in August 1947. Media and her sister ship Parthia were the first ships built for Cunard after the conclusion of World War II, and were built for transatlantic service between Liverpool and New York City. Media's maiden voyage began on 20 August 1947 from Liverpool. She received a major refit in 1953, part of which was the introduction of stabilisers; Media was the first ship on the transatlantic route so equipped. She continued on the transatlantic trade through the late 1950s, by which time competition from jet aircraft had cut into her passenger trade, and newer, faster cargo ships had done the same to her cargo trade. =Flavia= SS Flavia in Miami In July 1961, Media was sold for ¬£740,000 to the Italian Cogedar Line to replace their Flaminia. She remained in service with Cunard until 30 September. On 12 October she was handed over in Liverpool, arriving at Genoa on 21 October. A nine-month refit by Officine A & R Navi, Genoa transformed her from a passenger-cargo liner to an ocean liner. A new bow increased her length by and a new funnel was provided. The refit increased her tonnage from to . She could now carry 1,320 tourist class passengers. The ship was renamed Flavia and used for round the world voyages and to transport emigrants to Australia. on 2 October 1962, Flavia departed from Genoa on her maiden voyage for the Cogedar Line. Sailing via the Suez Canal she visited Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney, arriving on 9 October. Departing from Sydney on 10 October, she sailed to Bremerhaven, which was to be her base for round the world voyages. The route that Flavia took on her round the world voyages was Bremerhaven ‚Äì Rotterdam ‚Äì Tilbury ‚Äì Cura√ßao ‚Äì Panama Canal ‚Äì Papeete ‚Äì Auckland ‚Äì Sydney ‚ÄìMelbourne ‚Äì Fremantle ‚Äì Aden ‚Äì Suez Canal ‚Äì Port Said ‚Äì Cannes ‚Äì Tilbury ‚Äì Rotterdam ‚Äì Bremerhaven. With the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 as a result of the Six-Day War, Flavia sailed via South Africa on her return to Europe. In 1968, the Cogedar Line was taken over by the Costa Line. She was refitted with her accommodation upgraded and a reduction in berths to 850 passengers transformed her into a cruise ship. She was used for cruises from Miami to the Bahamas until July 1977. She was then used for cruises in South America until April 1978, followed by Mediterranean cruises until September 1978, following which she resumed service on the Miami‚ÄìBahamas cruises. By the early 1980s, Flavia was showing her age and was becoming too expensive to operate. =Flavian= She was sold to the Virtue Shipping Company of Hong Kong and renamed Flavian. It was intended to use her as a casino cruise ship but these cruises were unpopular and Flavian spent the majority of the time moored in Hong Kong Harbour. =Lavia= SS Lavia on fire In 1982, the ship was renamed Lavia and a refit was started. On 7 January 1989, a workman's fire got out of control. It spread throughout the ship although all nine crew and 35 workmen on board escaped unharmed. Four fireboats and over 250 firefighters tackled the blaze but Lavia sank owing to the vast amounts of water pumped aboard her in an effort to put out the flames. The ship was refloated and towed to Taiwan, where she arrived on 19 June. She was scrapped by Chi Shun Hia Steel Co Ltd, Kaohsiung. Description and propulsion Media was long, with a beam of and a draught of . She was propelled by two steam turbines of , double reduction geared, driving twin propellors. These gave her a speed of .

Pumpable ice is typically a slurry of ice crystals or particles ranging from 5 micrometers to 1 cm in diameter and transported in brine, seawater, food liquid, or gas bubbles of air, ozone, or carbon dioxide. Pumpable ice passed through plastic tubes Terminology Besides generic terms such as pumpable, jelly, or slurry ice, there are many trademark names for such coolant, like \\"Deepchill\\", ‚ÄúBeluga‚Äù, ‚Äúoptim‚Äù, ‚Äúflow‚Äù, ‚Äúfluid‚Äù, ‚Äújel‚Äù, ‚Äúbinary‚Äù, ‚Äúliquid‚Äù, ‚Äúmaxim‚Äù, ‚Äúwhipped‚Äù, and ‚Äúbubble slurry‚Äù ice. These trademarks are authorized by industrial ice maker production companies in Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and USA. Technological process There are two relatively simple methods for producing pumpable ice. The first is to manufacture commonly used forms of crystal solid ice, such as plate, tube, shell or flake ice, by crushing and mixing it with water. This mixture of different ice concentrations and particle dimensions (ice crystals can vary in length from 200 ¬µm to 10 mm) is passed by pumps from a storage tank to the consumer. The constructions, specifications and applications of current conventional ice makers are described in this reference: The idea behind the second method is to create the crystallization process inside the volume of the cooled liquid. This crystallization inside can be accomplished using vacuum or cooling technologies. In vacuum technology, very low pressure forces a small part of the water to evaporate while the remaining water freezes, forming a water-ice mixture. Depending on the additive concentrations, the final temperature of pumpable ice is between zero and ‚Äì4 ¬∞C. The large volume of vapor and an operating pressure of about 6 mbar (600 Pa) require the use of a water vapor compressor with a great swept volume. This technology is economically reasonable and can be recommended for systems with a cooling capacity of 1 MW (300 ton of refrigeration; 3.5 million BTU/h) or larger. Crystallization by cooling can be done using direct or indirect systems. =Direct pumpable ice technology= A refrigerant is directly injected inside the liquid The advantage of this method is the absence of any intermediate device between the refrigerant and the liquid. However, the absence of heat loss between refrigerant and liquid in the process of thermal interaction (heat transfer) may cause problems. The safety measures that have to be implemented, the need for the additional step of refrigerant separation, and difficulties in producing crystals are further disadvantages of this method. =Indirect pumpable ice technology= Pumpable ice of high concentration In indirect methods, the evaporator (heat exchanger-crystallizer) is assembled horizontally or vertically. It has a shell tubing assembled with one to a hundred inner tubes and containing a refrigerant that evaporates between the shell and the internal tubing. Liquid flows through the tubing of the small diameter. In the inside volume of the evaporator, cooling, super cooling, and freezing of the liquid take place due to heat exchange with the crystallizer- cooled wall. The idea is to use a well-polished evaporator surface (dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger) and appropriate mechanisms to prevent tubing from adhering to the ice embryos, and to prevent growth and a thickening of the ice on the inside cooling surface. A whip rod, screw, or shaft with metallic or plastic wipers is usually used as a mechanism for removal. Indirect pumpable ice technologies produce pumpable ice consisting of 5 to 50 micrometer crystals and have a number of advantages: they can produce 1,000 kg of crystal ice at the low energy expenditure of 60 to 75 kWh instead of the 90 to 130 kWh required to produce regular water ice (plate, flake, shell types). Further improvements are expected to lead to a specific energy expenditure for ice production of 40 to 55 kWh per 1,000 kg of pure ice and a high specific ice capacity per an area value at the evaporator cooling surface (up to 450 kg/(m2¬∑h)). Commercial evaporators of the double-pipe type used in the food and fish industries have an inside diameter of interior tube and length in a range of 50‚Äì125 mm and 60‚Äì300 cm. For the dewaxing lubrication oil, evaporators are widely used with the following dimensions: internal diameter of the inner tube is 150‚Äì300 mm; the length is 600‚Äì1,200 cm. Sometimes a gas can be added to the liquid flowing through the evaporator. It destroys the liquid laminar layer on the cooled surface of the heat exchanger-crystallizer, increases flow turbulence, and decreases the average viscosity of the pumpable ice. Different liquids, such as sea water, juice, brines, or glycol solutions of additives with more than 3‚Äì5% concentrations and a freezing point less than ‚àí2 ¬∞C are used in the process. Typically, the equipment for the production, accumulation and supplying of pumpable ice includes an ice maker, a storage tank, a heat exchanger, piping, pumps, and electrical and electronic appliances and devices. Pumpable ice with maximum ice concentration of 40% can be pumped straight from the ice maker to the consumer. The final possible ice concentration of pumpable ice in the storage tank is 50%. The maximum value of cooling energy of pumpable ice accumulated in the storage tank in a homogeneous phase is about 700 kWh, which corresponds to 10-15 m3 volume of a storage tank. A high-shear mixer is used to prevent the separation of ice from the cooled liquid and keeps the ice concentration unchanged over time and unaffected by the tank height. Pumpable ice is transported from the storage tank to a place of consumption that could be hundreds of meters away. The practical ratio between the required electric power of the submersible mixer motor (kW) and the ‚Äúkneaded‚Äù pumpable ice volume (m3) is 1:1. In the tanks with volumes larger than 15 m3, pumpable ice is not mixed and the cold energy of stored ice is only used by a heat transfer of liquid that circulates between a storage tank and the consumers of cold. The disadvantages of existing ice storage reservoirs include the following: The chaotic uncontrollable upsurge of ice ridges which arise due to uneven sprinkling of warm fluid. This liquid is fed into the storage tank from the heat exchanger for further cooling by direct contact with the surface of the ice. The solution is sprayed unevenly in space. Moreover, the rate of supply is not constant. Therefore, the ice melts unevenly. Thus, the ice spikes rise above the ice surface, which leads to the destruction of the spraying devices. In this case, it is necessary to reduce the level of solution in the storage tank to avoid breakage of spray devices. Ice accumulated in the tank turns into a large chunk. The warm liquid that comes from the air-conditioning system may generate channels through which the liquid could return to the system without being cooled. As a result, the accumulated ice is not fully utilized. Ineffective use of the volume of the accumulation tank leads to a decrease in the achievable maximum of ice concentration and an inability to fill the entire working volume of the storage tank. Research and development on overcoming these disadvantages is underway and is expected to lead to the mass production of cheap, reliable and efficient accumulating tanks. These tanks should ensure higher ice concentrations and allow full use of stored cold potential. Applications Many ice maker producers, research centers, inventors are working on pumpable ice technologies. Due to their high energy efficiency, reduced size and low refrigerant charges, there are many applications for this technology. =Selection= There are different pumpable ice maker designs and many special areas of application. The choice is facilitated by computer programs developed by manufacturers. A customer who intends to use pumpable ice technology should know: * Required maximum/minimum cooling capacity (TR) * Profile of energy consumption (TR‚Ä¢h) of the plant over 24 h, one week, one season, and one year * Temperature ranges of the products to be refrigerated (water, juice, liquid, food, and fish) * Temperature conditions of the climate at the location of the customer * Design limitations on equipment placement * Characteristics of the power supply system * Intentions and plans of future expansion When designing storage tanks, several features are to be taken into account: * Target of usage of PIT system: Applying pumpable ice for direct contact with a refrigerated product requires the installation of storage tanks with a mixer. To prevail over the tendency of ice to freeze in an iceberg form and to pump ice through the pipes over a distance of 100 m to 200 m, continuous mixing must be used. For pumpable ice applications in thermal energy storage systems, mixing is not needed. * Available space: To determine the type of construction (vertical or horizontal ) and the number of storage tanks, site dimensions and permissible heights must be considered. * Required daily and weekly stored energy: The cost of the storage tanks is a significant factor in the total cost of a pumpable ice system. Typically, storage tanks are designed with a stored energy value 10‚Äì20% higher than that required for production. Furthermore, it has to be remembered that 100% ice concentration in the tank is impossible. The thickness of the wall of the evaporators is usually determined to ensure: * High sustainable heat transfer flux during the process * Tensile strength of the inside pipe adequate to withstand the external pressure * Tensile strength of the outside pipe adequate to withstand internal pressure * Enough room for corrosion * Availability of spare parts Evaporators are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long pipe length. Thus, the evaporator of pumpable ice makers is typically as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations, including the space available at the customer site where the pumpable ice maker is going to be used. =Maintenance and service= A pumpable ice maker has predictive maintenance and cleaning requirements. Operational conditions of the specific equipment determine the service intervals and types of service. Proper refrigeration maintenance of a pumpable ice maker will extend its life, and routine maintenance can reduce the probability of an emergency service caused by major component failure, such as of a refrigeration compressor or the fan motor of the air condenser due to a dirty coil, and refrigerant leakage. Possible problems caused by not maintaining the air-cooled pumpable ice maker are: * Failure of fan motors caused by dirty coils restricting air flow * Failure of the thermostat caused by high amp draw due to dirty condenser coils * Failure of refrigeration compressor caused by dirty condenser coil and excessive head pressure * Restriction of capillary tubing (metering device) caused by refrigerant oil overheating and fouling * Wiring burning and failure due to excessive amperage caused by high head pressure and dirty condenser coils * Increased electrical consumption due to longer-run times caused by dirty condenser coils * Pollution and blockage of the line of condensate water. In the pumpable ice maker liquid treatment is used to remove particles down to 1 ¬µm in size and to minimize fouling of the heat transfer surface of the evaporators. Plate heat exchangers also need to be disassembled and cleaned periodically. Properly treating liquid before it enters the pumpable ice maker or the Plate heat exchanger will help to limit the amount of scale build-up, thus reducing cleaning times and preventative maintenance costs. Improperly sizing the liquid filter system leads to costly early change outs and poor performance. =Wastewater treatment= Pumpable ice technologies can be recommended for cleaning (lightening) sediments in waste waters. In this case, a method including freezing and further melting with subsequent separation of the liquid and solid phases is used. This method leads to a variation in the physical-chemical structure of sediments and is realized owing to redistribution of any form of the connection of moisture with solid particles of the sediment. It does not need any chemical reagent. The sediment's freezing promotes an increase in the free water quantity of the sediment and improves the efficiency of sediment precipitation. Most of the moisture is capable of diffusion at any of the conditions. Therefore, if the velocity of crystal growing does not exceed 0.02 m/h, there is time for moisture to migrate from colloid cells to the crystal surface, where it is frozen. After thawing, lightened water can be used for industrial and agriculture applications. The concentrated sediments are supplied to press-filters to further decrease their moisture content. =Desalination of seawater= The existing commercialized desalination methods are multi-stage flash evaporation, vapor-compression, multi-effect evaporation, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis. Theoretically, freezing has some advantages over the above- mentioned methods. They include a lower theoretical energy requirement, minimal potential for corrosion, and little scaling or precipitating. The disadvantage is that freezing involves a handling of ice and water mixtures that is mechanically complicated, both as to moving and processing. A small number of desalination stations have been built over the last 50 years, but the process has not been a commercial success in the production of freshwater for municipal purposes. Pumpable ice machines offer an affordable alternative because of the high efficient crystallization process. Current models, however, do not have the necessary capacity for industrial desalination plants, but smaller models suffice for small-scale desalination needs. =Processes of concentration of food liquid and juice= Currently, reverse osmosis and vacuum-evaporation technologies are used to concentrate juices and other food liquids. In commercial operations, juice is normally concentrated by evaporation. Since 1962, the Thermally Accelerated Short Time Evaporator (TASTE) has been widely used. TASTE evaporators are efficient, sanitary, easy to clean, of high capacity, simple to operate, and of relatively low cost. On the other hand, there is some heat damage to the product caused by the high- temperature steam treatment. This treatment results in product quality and aroma losses. Because of the low value of the film coefficient between steam and treated juice, heat transfer between them is very inefficient. It leads to the cumbersome construction of TASTE plants. The alternative is to concentrate juice and food liquid by a cooling and freezing process. In this case crystals of pure water are removed from the juice, wine, or beer by crystallization. The aroma, color, and flavor remain in the concentrated medium. The quality of freeze-concentrated products cannot be achieved by any other technology. The main advantages in comparison with other freezing techniques are low energy expenditure and the possibility to tune the rate of the phase change from liquid to solid ice, which in turn increases the production of pure water ice crystals and simplifies the separation of concentrated juice or food liquid and ice crystals. = Production of frozen food liquids = In the 1990s, frozen carbonated beverages and frozen uncarbonated beverages began to enjoy great popularity. The manufacture (process and refrigeration equipment) of almost all frozen carbonated beverages and frozen uncarbonated beverages is organized like the production of pumpable ice.  Frozen carbonated beverages  Frozen Coke The frozen carbonated beverage machine was invented in the late 1950s by Omar Knedlik. For frozen carbonated beverage manufacturing, a mixture of flavored syrup, carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and filtered water are used. Typically, the initial temperature of the mixture is 12‚Äì18 ¬∞C. The carbonated mixture is fed into the evaporator of the apparatus, then freezes on the inner surface of the cylindrical evaporator and is scraped off by the blades‚Äîmixers rotating at 60 to 200 rpm. In the internal volume of the crystallizer, a slight positive pressure (up to 3 bar) is maintained to improve the dissolution of gas into the liquid. In modern frozen carbonated beverage devices, there is a conventional refrigeration circuit with a capillary tube or thermostatic expansion valve and, usually, an air condenser. Refrigerant is fed either directly into the cavity of a two-wall evaporator or into the spiral evaporator wound on the outer surface of the crystallizer. The evaporator wall is made of stainless steel grade SS316L, approved for contact with food according to requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration. The evaporator temperature is ‚àí32 to ‚àí20 ¬∞C. Manufacturers do not reveal the hourly capacity of frozen carbonated beverages machines, but the energy expenditure to produce 10.0 kg of frozen carbonated beverages can be 1.5‚Äì2.0 kWh. After mixing and freezing in the crystallizer-mixer, the frozen carbonated beverage is ejected through the nozzle into cups. The end product is a thick mixture of suspended ice crystals with a relatively small amount of liquid. Frozen carbonated beverage quality depends on many factors, including the concentration, size and structure of the ice crystals. The concentration of the ice water mixture is determined accurately in accordance with the phase diagram of the solution and can reach 50%. The maximum crystal size is 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm. The initial temperature of crystallization of the mixture depends on the initial concentration of ingredients in the water and lies between ‚àí2.0 ¬∞C and ‚àí0.5 ¬∞C. The final temperature of the product varies between ‚àí6.0 ¬∞C and ‚àí2.0 ¬∞C, depending on the manufacturer. Interest in frozen carbonated beverages was noted in India. The Indian government prohibits the addition of ice produced from municipal water to beverages due to the probability of bacteriological contamination. Using a carbonated beverage in the form of frozen Coke offered a method to create an ice-chilled beverage in India.  Frozen uncarbonated beverages  Frozen orange juice Initially, frozen carbonated beverages were produced using fruit, vegetable juices, or drinks based on coffee, tea or yogurt. Research is being conducted on producing frozen wine and beer. Frozen uncarbonated beverage machines differ from frozen carbonated beverage machines in that they do not require a small positive pressure to be maintained in the working volume of the evaporator, nor a source of carbon dioxide gas, nor specially trained staff. Otherwise, the design of modern frozen uncarbonated beverage machines is similar to that for frozen carbonated beverages. Frozen uncarbonated beverages often have a lower concentration of ice, and more liquid water, than frozen carbonated beverages. Frozen uncarbonated beverages machines are less complicated and cheaper than frozen carbonated beverage devices, making them more common.  Ice cream  The ice cream production market steadily increased throughout the 1990s and its value is multibillions of US dollars. The eight major ice cream markets in the world are USA, China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia, France and UK. The key competitors in the industry are Unilever and Nestle, who together control over one-third of the market. The top five ice-cream consuming countries are the US, New Zealand, Denmark, Australia and Belgium. The modern design of industrial ice cream freezers ensures a high level of machine/operator interface and top quality of the produced ice cream. The manufacturing process of ice cream production includes pasteurization, homogenization and maturation of the ice cream mixture. The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer ‚Äì heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of ice cream are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket. Usually, the initial temperature of an ice cream mixture is 12‚Äì18 ¬∞C. After switching on a freezer, an evaporating temperature of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from ‚àí25 to ‚àí32 ¬∞C. The final temperature of the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about ‚àí5 ¬∞C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30‚Äì50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product. There are also rotating dashers that help to whip the mix and incorporate air into the mixture. The frozen product then goes to the distributor. The quality of ice cream and its smooth texture depend on the structure of their ice crystals and their dimensions, and on the viscosity of the ice cream. Water freezes out of a liquid in its pure form as ice. The concentration of the remaining liquid sugar mixture increases due to water removal, hence the freezing point is further lowered. Thus the structure of ice cream can be described as a partly frozen foam with ice crystals and air bubbles occupying most of the space. Tiny fat globules flocculate and surround the air bubbles in the form of a dispersed phase. Proteins and emulsifiers in turn surround the fat globules. The continuous phase consists of a concentrated, unfrozen liquid of sugars. The final average diameter of ice crystals depends on the rate of freezing. The faster this is, the more nucleation is promoted and the greater the number of small ice crystals. Usually, after a cooling treatment ice crystal dimensions in the freezer are about 35‚Äì80 ¬µm. =Fishery and food industry= Tub filled with pumpable ice made from seawater Fish cooled by pumpable ice Pumpable-ice-technology-based equipment can be used in the cooling processes in the fishery and food industries. In comparison with freshwater solid ice, the main advantages are the following: homogeneity, higher cooling rates of food and fish. Pumpable ice flows like water and eliminates freeze burns and physical damage to the cooled object; it increases food quality enabling a longer shelf life. Pumpable ice technology meets Food Safety and Public health regulations (HACCP and ISO). Pumpable ice has a lower specific energy expenditure compared with existing technologies using conventional freshwater solid ice. =Supermarkets= Refrigeration systems using pumpable ice technology are attractive for the air cooling of supermarket counters (showcases). For this application, pumpable ice is circulated through the already available piping as a coolant, replacing environmentally unfriendly refrigerants like R-22 (Freon) and other hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC‚Äôs). Reasons to use pumpable ice technology for this application are the following: # Pumpable ice heat transfer rates result in compact equipment. The equipment is smaller than that of other vendors of refrigeration equipment of the same capacity. It occupies less floor area, has lower volume and weight; # Pumpable ice structure results in substantially better parameters of this cooling medium. Greater capacities can be calculated, whether per one pass of the solution through the evaporator, per unit floor area occupied by the equipment, or per unit weight of the equipment; # With pumpable ice technology it is easy to maintain a constant temperature inside supermarket display cases or cabinets; # Pumpable ice technology enables the cooling system to be more flexible, so the food cabinets can be easily rearranged according to increased or decreased requirements; # Pumpable-ice-technology-based show cabinets need less refrigeration piping, less labor to install and lower cost to find leaks in comparison with direct expansion and refrigerant pump circulation systems; # Due to the high efficiency of pumpable ice technology, the heat transfer process takes place with a very low refrigerant charge in the cooling equipment; # Unlike direct expansion systems, pumpable-ice-technology-based display cabinets and cases do not produce heat, since there is no need for air condensers under the cabinets. Therefore, the air around the cabinets is not heated; # With pumpable ice technology, less energy is needed for defrosting supermarket display cases and cabinets. =Production of ice wine= Wide perspectives for pumpable ice usage open up for the production of special wines reminiscent of \\"ice wine\\" (German Eiswein). In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, pumpable ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the grapes. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the pumpable ice machine. The juice is pumped through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat concentrated juice. Liquid ice returns to the accumulation tank, in which there is a natural (according to Archimedes law) separation of ice and juice. The cycle is repeated many times until the sugar concentration reaches 50‚Äì52¬∞Brix. Then a process of fermentation takes place, resulting in this alcoholic drink. =Thermal energy storage systems= Pumpable ice maker and storage tank installed in a basement of Cyprus Olimpic supermarket A pumpable- ice-based Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS) can be used in centralized water-cooled air-conditioning systems in order to eliminate peak demand loads at critical times. This reduces the operating costs of buildings, the need for new power plants and modern transmission lines, power plant energy consumption and pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The idea is to make and accumulate pumpable ice during off-peak electricity hours with the lowest kWh tariff. The stored pumpable ice is used during middle- or high-tariff hours to cool the equipment or air supplied to the buildings. The return on investments (ROI) takes 2‚Äì4 years. In comparison with static and dynamic ice storage systems, the overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) during the production of pumpable ice is more than tens or hundreds of times higher (more efficient) than the same coefficient for the above-mentioned TESS types. This is explained by the presence of many different kinds of thermal resistances between the boiling refrigerant at the evaporator and water/ice in the storage tanks of static and dynamic ice storage systems. The high OHTC value pumpable- ice-technology-based TESS means a decrease in component volume, an increase in the maximum achievable concentration of ice in the volume of a storage tank, and ultimately a decrease in the price of equipment. TESSs based on pumpable ice technology have been installed in Japan, Korea, USA, UK and Saudi Arabia. =Medicine= A protective cooling process based on the implementation of a developed special ice slurry has been developed for medical applications. In this case pumpable ice can be injected intra-arterially, intravenously, along the external surfaces of organs using laparoscopy, or even via the endotracheal tube. It is being confirmed that pumpable ice can selectively cool organs to prevent or limit ischemic damage after a stroke or heart attack. Completed medical tests on animals simulated conditions requiring in- hospital kidney laparoscopic procedures. Results of French and US research are yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Benefits of pumpable ice technology in medicinal applications are: # Pumpable ice can be pumped easily through narrow catheters, providing high cooling capacity and rapid and targeted cooling of organs; # Pumpable ice may provide protective cooling and temperature management of target organs during surgery; # Pumpable ice helps victims of such medical emergencies as cardiac arrest and stroke. =Ski resorts= Ski resorts have a strong interest in producing snow, even when the ambient temperature is as high as 20 ¬∞C. The dimensions and power expenditure of known snow-production equipment depend on humidity and wind conditions. This snow-making equipment is based on the freezing of water droplets which are sprayed into air before they reach the ground surface, and requires an ambient temperature lower than ‚àí4 ¬∞C. Pumpable ice produced by Vacuum Ice Maker (VIM) Technology allows professional skiers to increase their training periods to extend before and after winter season (into late autumn and early spring). The pumpable ice process is organized as following. A salt solution is exposed to very low pressure inside the VIM. A small part of it evaporates in the form of water due to the vacuum forces, while the remaining liquid is frozen, forming a mixture. The water vapor is continuously evacuated from the VIM, compressed, and fed into a condenser due to the special construction of the centrifugal compressor. A standard water chiller supplies cooling water at 5 ¬∞C in order to condense the water vapor. The liquid-ice mixture is pumped out from the freezing volume to the ice concentrator in which ice crystals separate from the liquid. The high concentration ice is extracted from the concentrator. VIMs have been installed at Austrian and Swiss ski resorts .

It is native to New Zealand and is found on beaches throughout New Zealand. Its MƒÅori name is ngungutawa. The adult spends the daylight hours buried in the sand, emerging at night to fly noisily around in search of mates and food. It leaves obvious trails in the sand when walking around. The female lays eggs deep in the sand and the large white grubs can often be found under driftwood, though they feed on roots of dune plants.  Description  Thomas Broun described the species as follows:  Distribution and habitat  Male Pericoptus truncatus lateral view Pericoptus truncatus lives in sandy shore areas where driftwood is present, from Ninety Mile beach to Surat Bay, near Bluff. The beetle and its larvae inhabit the area extending from above the high tide mark and including the dunes fronting the beach. They do not seem to occur in dunes found further inland. The larvae, pupae and adults are common amongst the roots of marram grass and under or within driftwood. The beetles can be found to be living up to 1.2m below ground.  Ecology  Pericoptus truncatus larvae have an unknown association with the Mumulaelaps ammochostos mite, which are found living on the outside of the larvae. The association is unlikely to be parasitic and it has been suggested that the mites may actually feed on other mites and nematodes associated with the larvae. Threats Adult and larvae stage of Pericoptus truncatus An exotic Scoliidae wasp, the yellow flower wasp, Radumeris tasmaniensis has been found in Northland, North Island, New Zealand. This has been a cause for concern as R. tasmaniensis parasitises on the large sand scarab's larvae. The female stings and paralyses the scarab larva and lays eggs on it. The wasp larva then slowly consumes the paralysed beetle larva. = Parasites = At certain times of the month Pericoptus truncatus larvae have been observed immersing themselves in the saltwater saturated sand at the low tide zone for a period & then returning to the sand dunes. This behaviour was mostly conducted under the safety of night-time.

It has been defined as \\"A form of direct mail in which an advertiser sends a letter to a potential customer.\\" It is distinct from other direct mail techniques, such as the distribution of leaflets and catalogues, as the sales letter typically sells a single product or product line, and further tends to be mainly textual as opposed to graphics-based, although video sales letters have become increasingly popular. It is typically used for products or services which, due to their price, are a considered purchase at medium or high value (typically tens to thousands of dollars). A sales letter is often, but not exclusively, the last stage of the sales process before the customer places an order, and is designed to ensure that the prospect is committed to becoming a customer. Since the advent of the internet, the sales letter has become an integral part of internet marketing, and typically takes the form of an email or webpage. Unsolicited sales emails are known as spam, although spam typically consists of emails which are much shorter than a normal sales letter. Offline, unsolicited sales letters are known as junk mail. Some relevant components The sales letter is split into several key sections. In addition, other sections may be used, such as sub-headlines. =Headline= The beginning of a sales letter is considered to be its most important piece. In email sales letters this part is called email subject, and with webpages it takes the format of a title or headline, often followed by additional text called sub-heading. =Body copy= This section is typically quite long, with 4, 8 and 16 page letters being common formats. This section will typically contain testimonials from the firm's customers as well as pictures and information about the product. On the internet, the body copy may include embedded video or audio. =Conclusion= Sales Letter intended to get the customer to commit to purchasing the product or service, typically without any further intervention. Sales letter are a special form of advertising, aiming to sell company‚Äôs goods and services. Sales letter must be arouse interest, sound convincing, create a desire and encourage the reader to take action. Write in a positive, convincing style but don,t be aggressive. Present advantages and benefits to the reader. Encourage a response from to the reader- a phone call, a visit, a reply on an attached form etc. =Graphic design= The graphic design of a sales letter is an important part of the branding. The font, layout, line spacing, paragraph formatting, images, etc. all have an effect on the efficacy of the letter. Development of sales letters Because of the direct response nature of sales letters, they can be carefully tested on an ongoing basis to determine which version performs best in terms of converting readers to customers. Sales letters are typically developed incrementally, with split testing of various elements. This allows the marketeer or copywriter to confirm which headline, body text or graphic design converts best. On the internet, it is possible to track additional variables, such as the open rate of emails, the bounce rate, clickthrough to the checkout, etc. References Direct marketing Spamming ","title":"Sales letter"},{"id":"25087055","text":"Pericoptus frontalis is a sand scarab native to New Zealand which inhabits sandy river banks and sandbars in inland Otago.

Egeberg was once Oslo's biggest private residence at 1600 square metres over two floors and a tower section. At the turn of the century, the a mansion stood tall surrounded by a big park and with a splendid view over the city and harbour. Einar Westye Egeberg Egeberg was constructed in 1899-1901 on the basis of designs by leading architect Halfdan Berle (1861- 1929). The mansion was constructed on behalf of Einar Westye Egeberg (1851-1940) and his wife Birgitte Halvordine (1857-1930). Einar Westye Egeberg co-owned one of Oslo's most important lumber companies, Westye Egeberg & Co . The Egeberg couple had seven children of which most had reached adulthood when the family moved into the a mansion in 1901. Construction The total construction cost was in 1901. The construction was done using quality materials such as granite and soapstone. The architectural style was Italian renaissance dominated by noble forms. The interior ceilings were made by Italian stucco workers. The first floor contained hall, vestibule, smoking lounge, dining room, kitchen, loggia, garden room and cabinet. In the second floor, there were bed rooms, dressing rooms and bath room. The tower held the billiard room whereas storage rooms were found in the basement. Mrs. Egeberg suffered from a weak health and was partially paralyzed. Therefore, a lift was installed at a cost of NOK 25,000. A car‚Äîan open Minerva similar to that of the Norwegian royal family‚Äîwas acquired in 1912 for Mrs. Egeberg to be able go on a daily drive with the chauffeur. She died in 1930. Later years After his wife's death, Einar Egeberg did not want to live alone in the big residence, and thus wanted to sell it, which proved difficult during the 1930s economic depression. In the end, Egeberg was sold to Bolig-Bygg AS. Another two floors were added within the original building construction: one additional floor was created by splitting the second floor into two separate floors. The fourth floor came from converting the original loft surrounding the billiard room into living area. Thus, Egeberg changed from a private residence to an apartment building with 24 apartments.

Indeed, it seems likely that the signal that was interpreted as being the result of planetary companions might be instead the result of not well- studied interactions between the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion: as of 2014 all proposed orbital solutions have been refuted and it appears that the full set of timing measurements is inconsistent with any 1, 2 or 3-planet system due to poor fits to the data and unstable orbital configurations.

A Schottky transistor is a combination of a transistor and a Schottky diode that prevents the transistor from saturating by diverting the excessive input current. It is also called a Schottky-clamped transistor. Mechanism Symbol Effective internal circuit composed of Schottky diode and bipolar junction transistor. Standard transistor-transistor logic (TTL) uses transistors as saturated switches. A saturated transistor is turned on hard, which means it has a lot more base drive than it needs for the collector current it is drawing. The extra base drive creates a stored charge in the base of the transistor. The stored charge causes problems when the transistor needs to be switched from on to off: while the charge is present, the transistor is on; all the charge must be removed before the transistor will turn off. Removing the charge takes time (called storage time), so the result of saturation is a delay between the applied turn-off input at the base and the voltage swing at the collector. Storage time accounts for a significant portion of the propagation delay in the original TTL logic family. Storage time can be eliminated and propagation delay can be reduced by keeping the switching transistors from saturating. Schottky transistors prevent saturation and the stored base charge. A Schottky transistor places a Schottky diode between the base and collector of the transistor. As the transistor comes close to saturating, the Schottky diode conducts and shunts any excess base drive to the collector. (This saturation avoidance technique is used in the 1956 Baker clamp.) The resulting transistors, which do not saturate, are Schottky transistors. The Schottky TTL logic families (such as S and LS) use Schottky transistors in critical places. Operation When forward biased, a Schottky diode's voltage drop is much less than a standard silicon diode's, 0.25 V versus 0.6 V. In a standard saturated transistor, the base-to-collector voltage is 0.6 V. In a Schottky transistor, the Schottky diode shunts current from the base into the collector before the transistor goes into saturation. The input current which drives the transistor's base sees two paths, one path into the base and the other path through the Schottky diode and into the collector. When the transistor conducts, there will be about 0.6 V across its base‚Äìemitter junction. Typically, the collector voltage will be higher than the base voltage, and the Schottky diode will be reverse biased. If the input current is increased, then the collector voltage falls below the base voltage, and the Schottky diode starts to conduct and shunt some of the base drive current into the collector. The transistor is designed so that its collector saturation voltage () is less than the base‚Äìemitter voltage (roughly 0.6 V) minus the Schottky diode's forward voltage drop (roughly 0.2 V). Consequently, the excess input current is shunted away from the base and the transistor never goes into saturation. History In 1956, Richard Baker described some discrete diode clamp circuits to keep transistors from saturating. The circuits are now known as Baker clamps. One of those clamp circuits used a single germanium diode to clamp a silicon transistor in a circuit configuration that is the same as the Schottky transistor. The circuit relied on the germanium diode having a lower forward voltage drop than a silicon diode would have. In 1964, James R. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor. In his patent the Schottky diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The diode could also be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. His patent also showed how the Schottky transistor could be used in DTL circuits and improve the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost.

Biography Carlos Malcolm was born in Panama c. 1935Porter stated that he was 69 in 2004. to Jamaican parents and grew up in Kingston.Greene, Jo-Ann \\"[ Ska-Mania: The Sound of the Soil review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation, retrieved 15 November 2009. His father, Wilfred Malcolm, went to Panama and worked as a bookkeeper in the Panama Canal Zone. He became a prominent business man in the city of Colon, established homes in both countries and sent his five children back to Jamaica to be educated. Having studied the liturgy and music of the Anglican (Episcopalian) Church, Wilfred Malcolm was an Anglican church choir director for many years. He also played trombone in the \\"Jazz Aristocrats\\", a Panamanian Dixieland band for which he was manager, and he took the band to Jamaica in 1936.Porter, Christopher (2004), \\"Jazz to Ska Mania\\", Jazz Times, July/August 2004, retrieved 15 November 2009. Wilfred Malcolm had quite a collection of eclectic music that extended from Bach and Handel to Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Reflecting upon this period of his life, Carlos often mused that he probably \\"subliminally osmosed\\" the musical styles and arranging formats of various composers as he whistled back at the music wafting through the house every evening his father came home. This probably accounts for Carlos's notoriety among peers as a \\"musical chameleon\\" because he arranges music and functions comfortably in a variety of musical cultures and genres. His father and a few prominent West Indian businessmen in Panama formed a committee that brought to Panama world-class Black American artists in the performing arts. As a child, Carlos recalls listening from the bedroom to conversations and laughter from guests, including celebrated artists Paul Robeson (baritone), Marian Anderson (contralto), Hazel Scott‚ÄìPowell (wife of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., of Abyssinia Baptist Church of Harlem) as they came to late dinners after recitals at a local theatre. Carlos's father taught him to play the trombone. He also recognised Carlos's natural gift for creating and arranging music and supported his son's desire to pursue an education in the arts. Carlos holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Union Institute and University of Cincinnati, Ohio. From the late 1950s Carlos Malcolm worked professionally as a musician in conjunction with his \\"other job\\" as a photo journalist with the West Indian Review magazine in Kingston. His first music \\"gigs\\" were with the Vivian Hall All Stars which featured Don Drummond on trombone. Carlos and Drummond became good friends and quite often would practise the trombone together. With independence looming in the future the Government of Jamaica resolved to develop its native talent in the visual and performing arts. Carlos (invited by Sonny Bradshaw) was among the first cadre of writers, producers and musicians to develop and showcase local talent in the performing arts on live shows broadcast from local theatres, produced by the newly constructed Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation. As head arranger in the Variety Department Carlos Malcolm was the first arranger to write formal arrangements of Jamaica Ska music. Many of the early Ska musical arrangements for singers were \\"head arrangements\\" improvised by the accompanying musicians \\"at the mike\\". Carlos would transcribe music from 7-inch 45RPM records and formally re-arrange the music for the JBC Studio Band to accompany singers on live shows. The popular Jamaican Hit Parade program partially developed by Malcolm, spawned and influenced the careers of many Jamaican artists such as Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley, who became international Jamaican music icons. Along with musicians such as Bertie King and Lennie Hibbert, Malcolm formed a short-lived school of jazz with the aim of producing home-grown jazz musicians who could make music that would sell overseas; recorded music at that time was mostly imported.Murrell, Nathaniel Samuel, Spencer, William David, & McFarlane, Adrian Anthony (1998), Chanting Down Babylon: The Rastafari Reader, Temple University Press, , p. 252. In addition to his contract at the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation Malcolm also worked as a composer and arranger for other clients such as the Jamaica Little Theatre Movement for whom he created original musical for the libretti of two pantomimes: Banana Boy in December 1958 (libretto by Ortford St John) and Jamaica Way in 1960 ‚Äì libretto by Samuel Hillary. In 1962 Carlos became the first musical director of the Jamaica National Dance Theatre Company created by Dr. Rex Nettleford of the University of the West Indies, for which Carlos and Oswald Russell created original works for the debut performance of the Company at the Inaugural Celebrations of Jamaica's Independence. In 1963 Eon Production went to Jamaica to film Dr. No, the first James Bond movie, and employed Carlos Malcolm to write incidental tropical music for the film. He was appointed director of \\"island content\\" of the musical score.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004), The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, , p. 46.Johnson, Richard (2008) \\"James Bond's Jamaica: A marriage between the famous spy and paradise\\", Jamaica Observer, 16 November 2008, retrieved 15 November 2009. Prior to forming his own band, Carlos Malcolm's music company, Carmal, created musical commercial jingles for several American and English brand products publicised by advertising agencies in Kingston: Vick's Vapourub, Shell Oil, Texaco, Oil Tek Toothbrushes, Milo Cup of Health, Berger Paints, Maxwell House Coffee and many more. Combining the experiences of his journey in music, Carlos formed his own band in 1963 called the Afro-Jamaican Rhythms, with members including Karl Bryan (saxophone), Larry McDonald (conga drums), Boris Gardiner (vocals, bass), Lascelles Perkins (vocals), and Winston \\"Sparrow\\" Martin (drums). Other members during the 1960s included Joe Higgs, and Eddie Parkins.Thompson, Dave (2002), Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , p. 356. The band played a blend of ska, mento, African and jazz music and recorded several albums in the 1960s. They enjoyed a big hit in Jamaica in 1964 with their version of the theme from Bonanza, retitled \\"Bonanza Ska\\". Other hits included \\"Rukumbine\\" (1963). Malcolm also spent time in New York in the mid-1960s where he recorded the albums Don't Walk, Dance! (1964) and Sounds of the Caribbean (1966), mixing Caribbean and American styles.Huey, Steve \\"[ Carlos Malcolm Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation, retrieved 15 November 2009 His 1970 album Bustin' Outta the Ghetto concentrated on funk with only a slight Jamaican influence.Unterberger, Richie \\"[ Bustin' Outta the Ghetto Review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation, retrieved 15 November 2009. The \\"Bustin' Outta the Ghetto\\" CD is still much-sought by Deep Funk collectors of the fully-fledged funk arrangements. From the late the 1970s through the '80s Carlos took a hiatus from to bring up a family. He went back to publishing and worked for a large newspaper in Orange County, California, selling display advertising. In 1995, Carlos Malcolm was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Ocho Rios Jazz Festival, along with James Moody, the celebrated jazz alto saxophonist/flautist. In 1998 Carlos collaborated with US violinist and producer Robert Michael Way, aka \\"Zimbobway\\", on a projected pair of albums, The Return of Skalypso and No Forget The Bamboo Man.Varga, George (1998), \\"Malcolm and USD graduate to team up for Jamaican tribute\\", San Diego Union- Tribune, 3 June 1998. During this collaborative work, Carlos arranged twenty- four songs including four new compositions of ska and mento as well as four original works by Zimbobway. Musicians in the King Kingston Orchestra included Jamaican music legends Lloyd Wilkes (lead vocals) from The Sheiks, Pluto Shervington (bass/vocals), Trevor Lopez (guitar/vocals), Larry MacDonald (percussion), Fred Campbell (drums), and Cedric Im' Brooks (tenor saxophone)(all original members and players with Carlos Malcolm and the Afro- Jamaican Rhythms). In 1999, Carlos Malcolm was appointed an Artist in Residence by the California Arts Council for the City of San Diego, California. He created alternate educational learning programs, taught in middle schools and mentored \\"at-risk\\" teenagers in community centres with his program \\"bak2bay6 ‚Äìwith a Musical Twist\\", which teaches young student (as well as adults) the elements of English, Math Music and Critical Thinking, using \\"rap\\" and original songs to deliver subject matter. In August 2000, Carlos was invited by the Government of Jamaica, along with his orchestra, to the 37th Independence Celebrations and presented the Prime Minister's Lifetime Award for both his excellence in music and for his contributions to the development and enhancement of Jamaican music, internationally. In 2006 Carlos Malcolm was invited to Melbourne, to deliver a lecture at Victoria University of Melbourne to a group of academicians from various other cities, on his Early Education Children's Program, \\"Bak2bay6 ‚Äì With a Musical Twist\\". While in Australia, at the invitation of Australian National Radio Carlos also delivered a lecture/demonstration on the \\"History of Reggae Music\\" at the Prince Albert Ballroom in Melbourne. In his lecture, Carlos would periodically interrupt the lecture and conduct the 27-piece Melbourne Ska Orchestra to demonstrate how Jamaican Mento music seamlessly blended with New Orleans \\"Shuffle\\" music with a back-beat to deliver into a throbbing, indigenously Jamaican by-product named Ska music, and how Ska music evolved into the international phenomenon of Reggae. Carlos Malcolm relocated in Florida, where he continues to write and animate learning modules for alternate education programs using \\"rap music\\" and original songs to deliver the subject matter. He has over 100 mp3s compositions and arrangements on amazon.com, iTunes and other outlets. In addition to completing his book, Carlos Malcolm ‚Äì A Lifetime in Jamaican Music, Carlos Malcolm spends time composing Caribbean piano etudes and developing symphonic works of Jamaican folk (Mento) and other Caribbean folk music and creating original compositions that combine the elements of Caribbean polyrhythm, jazz and classical music formats and harmonies within each work.

With its maximum elevation of above sea level, it is amongst the highest tunnels in the Alps,After the Furka Tunnel, the second highest railway tunnel in Switzerland (not considering minor tunnels such as the Oberalp Pass tunnel and dead-end tunnels such as the Jungfrau Tunnel) and has a mountain overlay of up to . The tunnel has a length of . It opened for traffic in 1903. The northern portal of the tunnel is at Preda, in Berg√ºn, and the southern portal at Spinas, in the Bever valley. At a total length of , the tunnel connects the Albula Valley with the Engadin Valley, and, in so doing, passes under the watershed between the Rhine and the Danube a few kilometres west of the Albula Pass. The tunnel serves both passenger and freight traffic. The Glacier Express passes through it daily. During the winter season, car transporter trains operating between Thusis and Samedan also used the tunnel until 2011. Due to the threat of rockfalls and general deterioration over time, it was planned for the original tunnel to have been renovated during the 2020s. But in 2010, the Rhaetian Railway announced that it had identified the construction of a second tunnel alongside the first as its preferred option, with one of several reasons being a relatively minor difference in cost. Costed at around CHF 244 million, construction commenced during 2014. In comparison to the original Albula Tunnel, the new bore is considerably larger due to newer operational and safety standards. The second tunnel is set to be opened to traffic around 2022, with completion of the project including refurbishment of the original tunnel by 2023. Once completed, around 15,000 trains are predicted to use the tunnel each year; it has been built to allow for a maximum speed of 120 km/h.  History  Construction The Albula Tunnel is a major feature of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), an extensive metre- gauge network in the southeast of Switzerland that was launched during 1889. The railway's management had placed a significant emphasis on the line being attractive to the growing tourism market, thus the line traverses the northern valleys in a deliberately spectacular manner. The highest point of the line, being roughly 1,800 metres above sea level, is where the Albula tunnel was constructed. The construction effort was impacted by multiple unusual problems. The cold, , water outflows transformed the already fractured rock into a pulpy mass, regularly clogging up the shell of the northern tunnel lead (or adit). At the same time, a strong water source above the northern tunnel portal dried up. The water streaming in at had to be painstakingly diverted with pipelines. As a result, construction virtually came to a standstill: in the ten weeks from May 1900, only of tunnel were driven. These difficulties could not be overcome by the head construction contractor Ronchi & Carlotti, which entered into bankruptcy. From 1 April 1901, the Rhaetian Railway took the construction work into its own hands. With the use of a bonus system, it was able to regain part of the lost time. At 03:00 hours on 29 May 1902, the breakthrough of the two tunnel leads was achieved, at a point from the north portal, and , from the south portal. The finished tunnel had a length of 5,864 metres and contained a single track. It cost 7,828,000 Swiss francs to build. A total of 1,316 people were employed in the tunnel's construction. Overall, there were 16 fatal accidents involving construction workers; a stone memorial to commemorate these victims has been placed at the Preda station. During 1903, Albula Tunnel was opened to traffic. Early working of the tunnel was by steam locomotives, however both it and the entire route were later electrified using the standardised 15 kV, 16‚ÖîHz system. Various passenger services use the tunnel on a routine basis, such as the luxurious Glacier Express. According to industry publication Rail Engineer, the danger posed by rock falls became ever-present towards the latter half of the twentieth century. By 2006, inspections of the tunnel determined its condition to have degraded to the point where significant renovations were required. By this time, around 7.4 million passengers, including 2.3 million commuters, along with a high volume of freight traffic, was using the tunnel every year, thus any closure would have been highly disruptive. In June 2009, the Rhaetian Railway announced that it was conducting investigations into either fundamental modernisation or reconstruction of the tunnel.\\"RhB studies Albula tunnel replacement\\". Railway Gazette International, June 2009. While a second tunnel was constructed during the 2010s, the original Albula Tunnel has been retained. A total of 12 cross passages are to be excavated between the two tunnels, which shall enable personnel to travel between either bore, useful during emergency situations and routine maintenance activities alike. Following the completion of the second tunnel, the older tunnel has been scheduled to be temporarily closed to rail traffic while extensive repair works are carried out; this activity is to be largely focused on the stabilisation of its walls and roof. {  Preda station and the northern tunnel portal (1789 m a.s.l.).  Mountain overlay above the Albula Tunnel.  Spinas station (1815 m a.s.l.). }  Second Tunnel  Due to the declining condition of the original tunnel, the prospects for the construction of a brand new tunnel alongside the old was evaluated alongside other options; Studies determined that the total cost of such a tunnel would be around CHF 244 million. During 2010, the RHB announced that the building of a new tunnel had been identified as the optimal solution; detailed planning work commenced that same year. There were several advantages presented by this option. Most obviously, the old tunnel would be able to remain in use throughout the construction of the new tunnel, thus avoiding a lengthy closure of the line for its renovation. The presence of the existing tunnel also enabled it to act as a rescue bore for the new tunnel if ever required to do so. During December 2012, RhB handed over the plans for approval to the Federal Office of Transport. Close cooperation between RhB and authorities is necessary, particularly due to the location being an UNESCO- recognised world heritage site. During 2014, construction of the second tunnel formally commenced. In comparison to the original Albula Tunnel, the new bore is considerably large in terms of both width and height, which is primarily a result of the need to implement various newer operating standards and a greater consideration on its safety. The larger dimensions of the tunnel enables it to accommodate walkways throughout its length, as well as facilitating ideal clearances for the OLE fixtures. During its construction, the bore was sufficiently large and flat enough for road vehicles to directly reach the rock face, enabling conventional machinery to be brought in. Despite its increased width, the new tunnel is actually slightly shorter than the original bore, being roughly 5,860 metres in length. The tunnelling method was in line with conventional practices of the time. Construction sites were established at each of the future portals of the tunnel, which accommodated conveyor systems for moving excavated spoil from the tunnel bore to rail sidings for removal. The boring involved a pattern of drilling, blasting, spoil removal, and ancillary safety inspections. Fresh air was piped up to the rock face, creating a slightly higher pressure within the tunnel to help blow out both dust and diesel fumes being emitted by the excavation activities. Channels were also driven to handle water ingress, while both the roof and walls of the bore were stabilised via the application of wet-mix concrete. Whilst the geology surrounding the tunnel is principally granite, a 110-metre section close to the Preda end consists of three different types of rock, known as cellular dolomite, while a 20-metre section is largely dominated by a soft and porous type of dolomite akin to fine sand. Due to the absence of solid material, the risk of tunnel collapse was notably elevated during this section's construction. It was stabilised by freezing the surrounding ground to a minimum of 2.5 metres outside the excavation zone prior to boring work, which was followed up within the space of a week by the application of a 120 cm-thick lining of reinforced concrete; these measures resulted in slow progress however. As a result of the heavy snowfall typically present in the Swiss Alps during the winter months, which caused unavoidable accessibility disruptions to the tunnel site, all construction work was suspended between mid-December and the end of February. Outside of this seasonal shutdown, the site was worked 24 hours per day each day via shift working. According to Rail Engineer, an average distance of 6.5 metres would be driven during a single day. However, due to geological complications present at one part of the bore, the rate of progress was decreased to only around 0.7 metres per day. Boring shall involve a total of roughly 244,000 cubic metres of rock being excavated. The construction phase has been forecast to last 8.5 years; by August 2018, the tunnel's completion was expected sometime in 2022. On 2 October 2018, breakthrough between the two ends of the new bore occurred, a key milestone in the construction programme. In addition to the new tunnel itself, both Spinas and Preda stations on either side of the tunnel shall be modified. Once completed, around 15,000 trains are predicted to traverse the tunnel each year; it has been built to allow for a maximum speed of 120km/h.

It was developed by Google for use in their web applications such as Gmail, Google Docs and Google Maps. Closure Compiler The Closure Compiler is a tool for making JavaScript download and run faster, at the expense of human readability. It does not compile from JavaScript to machine code, but rather compiles from JavaScript to more efficient JavaScript. It parses JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minifies what is left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls. It supports transpiling modern ECMAScript code to ECMAScript 5, so that programmers can write JavaScript that uses those features, and run it in browsers or other environments that do not yet support them. (The Traceur Compiler is another Google project that supports transpiling ES6 to ES3.)  CLI based tools  Tool set provide a command line tools used to optimize and compile \`.js\` files: * Java-based application run from shell which compiles a list of specified JavaScript files * npm package \`google-closure-compiler\` which provides as optional dependencies three compilers: native (binary executable), JAVA and JavaScript-based one; which are installed at once.  Others  *Interactively in the browser: The Closure Compiler service website provides a form for a user to input a URL pointing to a JavaScript source or enter JavaScript source code in a textbox. The website will display with the optimized JavaScript on right side for the user to copy. *HTTP POST API: The Closure Compiler server accepts HTTP POST requests. Parameters include the string of JavaScript to be optimized (or a URL pointing to it), the optimization level, whether to include errors and warnings, and the output format (JSON, XML, or text). The Closure compiler also supports type checking via type annotations that must be written in JSDoc comments.  Ecosystem  Programming languages that transpile to JavaScript benefit from Closure Tools. For example, Closure Compiler helps to make ClojureScript practical by making the compiled JavaScript code more efficient. Closure Library The Closure Library is a JavaScript library, written specifically to take advantage of the Closure Compiler, based on a modular architecture. It provides cross-browser functions for DOM manipulations and events, Ajax and JSON, as well as more high-level objects such as User Interface widgets and Controls. Closure Templates Closure Templates are a templating system for dynamically generating HTML in both Java and JavaScript.https://code.google.com/closure/templates/docs/helloworld_js.html JavaScript Because the language was apparently referred to as \\"Soy\\" internal to Google, and \\"Soy\\" remains in some of the documentation and classes, sometimes Closure Templates are referred to as \\"Soy Templates\\".  Closure Stylesheets  This is a compiler which provides an extended version of CSS, which is compiled down to ordinary CSS. Internally in Google, this extended version of CSS is referred to as GSS.

She was born in La Romana, Dominican Republic and moved to New York when she was 12 years old. Baez is best known for her performance texts Dominicanish, Comrade, Bliss Ain't Playing and Levente no. Yolayorkdominicanyork. Baez describes herself as \\"a performer-writer-educator- director whose work explores the present and its encounters with the past and future.\\" Baez has been involved with multiple theatre festivals and travels globally conducting Ay Ombe workshops and theatre retreats. She often writes about her bi-lingual and bi-cultural experiences.

Dominicanish had a performance life of 10 fruitful years. The text has also been translated into Bengali.  Themes  Baez's works are related to the communities that she belong, mainly a penta-ocean that she swims up, down and around: her migrant-womanhood-working class-black-heart centric self. In her own interpretation: > Sound and silence movimiento y quietud Movement and stillness sonidos > silencios All colors All textures las gamas de los colores Swimming in all > possibilities texturas melodias en encuentros posibles A review of Comrade, Bliss ain't Playing describes the work as \\"an intimate journey dressed up with a beautiful vulnerability\\" Pulitzer Prize winner Junot D√≠az has said of Baez: > Josefina B√°ez has been breaking open hearts and re-ordering minds for more > years than I care to count. She is one of North America's finest artists and > she is, without question, one of my favorite writers. She is a sword bathed > in flame, she's a marvel. Levente no.Yolayorkdominicanyork is her finest > work yet. Baez uses her writing and performance to make several comments on race and identity. One thing she does is embrace her blackness and her Dominican heritage, something referred to as a \\"double-consciousness.\\" In addition to embracing her black and dominican identities, she must also acknowledge her identities of being an immigrant and trans-migrant, themes common in her writing and performances. When a dominican migrates to the United States, they are then neither considered fully Dominican or American. The individual is then considered to only partially belong to both cultures, creating an \\"in- betweenness.\\" By embracing and expressing her many identities and using her performances to share them, she is resisting America's attempt to marginalize her experience. Despite living in New York City, a racially and culturally diverse setting, Baez and other immigrants still feel the struggle everyday of not being accepted.  Performance Autology  Josefina Baez has also created a system of art, based on her own learning, called \\"Performance Autology\\". It has been described as: \\"It approaches the creative process from the autobiography of the doer. Technically kept to the core, this path is developed in sobriety. The physical, mental and spiritual realms are researched and nurtured. Sources in this study includes theatre biomechanics, yoga, meditation, calligraphy, world dance, music, literature, theatre, popular culture, tea culture, video arts, social, health and healing sciences, among others.\\"  Retreats  Baez and Ay Ombe organize theatre retreats internationally. Ay Ombe Retreats have already been held at: * Christchurch, New Zealand:February 2004; * Pirque and Miravalle, Chile:February 2005, April 2006, November 2007; * Bangalore, India:January 2009 * New York State: August 2009. * Sonido del Yaque Eco-lodge: Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic 2015 * Black Mountain, North Carolina 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016  Performances  Baez at a performance of Dominicanish. Harlem Stage, NYC. November 2009 Baez's 2009 performance of Dominicanish marked its 10th anniversary and took place at Harlem Stage, New York from November 6‚Äì8, 2009.http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Harlem_Stage_Presents_10th_Anniversary_Performance_of_DOMINICANISH_116_20091105 The word 'dominicanish' is used to describe her experience because, as a result of her migration, she is not only dominican. It deals with issues of migration and absorption of new cultures. Even her use of combining english and Spanish is an example of her being in-between two cultures. As she retells her experience of learning english, she moves her mouth and body in unique ways, while her feet remain still. This shows how American society is trying to force her to assimilate into their culture and her resistance to doing so. Baez draws heavily from her own experiences as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. Being a Dominican immigrant, Baez possesses multiple identities. In Dominicanish, her identity is defined as always being in motion. She is constantly moving between cultures or physically between two countries. This motion is expressed through her body movement as she is performing. The play is published slightly different throughout its editions since the state of the dominican immigrant is not static. In her performance of Dominicanish, she uses examples of daily activities as ways to resist a culture that is trying to erase her colored body. The one-woman play is directed by Claudio Mir and was accompanied by trumpet music by Ross Huff. The performance, which went under the title \\"OM is 10\\" was followed by an academic symposium \\"Dialogue Dominicanish\\" organized and co-ordinated by Esther Hernandez (Brown University). Participants included: Conrad James (Birmingham University, UK), Arturo Victoriano (University of Toronto, Canada), Danny Mendez (Michigan State University), Sophie Mari√±ez (CUNY Graduate Center), Nestor Rodriguez (University of Toronto, Canada), Merle Collins (University of Maryland, USA) and Percy Encinas (Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Peru). On March 6, 2015, Josefina directed a performance with students from Spanish 126: \\"Performing Latinidad\\" to discuss issues of identity and to bring the texts from their class to life. Professor Lorgia H. Garc√≠a Pe√±a, an assistant professor of Romance Languages and Literatures teaches the course at Harvard University.http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/6/spanish-class- performance-identity Many of Baez's performances are easily accessible to the public. In addition to performing on large stages, she also performs in smaller settings such as people's homes, on the street, in parks, and schools. This ultimately allows her performances to reach a wider audience and become more intimate. Her performance of Apartarte/Casarte is often performed in various locations, even in Baez's own home on one occasion. During this performance in front of only 12 people, she interacts with the audience throughout the performance. Apartarte/Casarte is a performance in which Baez combines parts from her other performances to comment on several themes such as her immigrant experience and marriage. There is a part where Baez expresses her happiness of being newly married, which quickly transitions to her frustration of being expected to live up to gendered housewife duties as she angrily performs acts of domesticity. In this performance, she is resisting the treatment of women and traditional gender roles.

The tomb was originally built for Marshal L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát and his wife but later became some other Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty's mandarins worship house. History L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát (1763-1831) was a Vietnamese general who helped Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh put down the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion and unify Vietnam. Born into a family of peasants nearby Ti·ªÅn Giang, Duyet joined prince Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's side in fighting the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion. Because of Duyet's military ability, he quickly rose through the rank of Nguy·ªÖn army and became a marshal when the T√¢y S∆°n-Nguy·ªÖn war ended. After the foundation of Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, Duyet served as a high-ranking mandarin and, later, viceroy of southern part of Vietnam. His governance greatly stabilized and developed the south of Vietnam, turning it into a wealthy and peaceful region. In addition, Duyet opposed emperor Minh M·∫°ng's succession and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationalist and Confucian policies. On 3 July 1832, L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát died in the Citadel of Saigon at the age of 68. He was buried at B√¨nh H√≤a, Gia ƒê·ªãnh (present day Ho Chi Minh City). His tomb was called \\"LƒÉng √îng (·ªü) B√† Chi·ªÉu\\" (Tomb of the Marshal in Ba Chieu) by the local people.Hu·ª≥nh Minh, pp. 132-133. Grave of L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát and his wife before 2008 Duyet's death opened the way for Minh M·∫°ng to apply his policies in the south, as the viceroy's successor would have lacked the influence to defy the emperor. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyet's followers‚Äô political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyet the last viceroy. Soon after Duyet's death, Minh M·∫°ng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyet and his aides had engaged in corruption and abusive practices.McLeod, p. 29. As a result, B·∫°ch Xu√¢n Nguy√™n, who led the investigation, ordered the posthumous humiliation of Duyet. This resulted in the desecration of his tomb, the execution of sixteen relatives, and the arrests of his colleagues. Minh M·∫°ng's attitude led L√™ VƒÉn Kh√¥i, an adopted son of L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, to revolt against the emperor.Hu·ª≥nh Minh, p. 133. After suppressing the revolt, the emperor had Duyet's tomb desecrated and had a stele with the inscription \\"ƒê√¢y ch·ªó t√™n l·∫°i c√°i l·ªông quy·ªÅn L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát ch·ªãu ph√©p n∆∞·ªõc\\" (Here the eunuch L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát who abused power was subjugated by law) placed over the ruins. The tomb remained in disrepair until the reign of next emperor, Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã, who rehabilitated Duyet and restored his tomb.Taylor, p. 210. Then, emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c turned the tomb into a national monument.Hu·ª≥nh Minh, p. 48. Grave of L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát and his wife in 2008. After the establishment of the colony of Cochinchina, Duyet was continuously venerated in spite of the French policies of dismantling the Vietnamese imperial system and its ritual customs. Duyet's yearly celebrations was attended by politicians of Cochinchina. In 1937, thank to the donations from number of colonial government officials and business elites, Duyet's tomb was renovated and extended. Under South Vietnam's rule, Duy·ªát was considered as national greatest hero. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, Duy·ªát was disliked by the current government because of his role in the expansion of French influence in Vietnam and his tomb got dilapidated because of the lack of state maintenance.Ray, Dragicevich, & Louis, p. 351.Dodd & Lewis, p. 101 This attitude remained unchanged until the year 2008, when the current government had Duy·ªát's tomb renovated and let a play portraying the life of Duyet be performed publicly. Nevertheless, Duy·ªát is widely regarded by southern Vietnamese people as the local most important hero. Choi Byung Wook described Duyet's popularity as following: \\"No matter whether they are indigenous Vietnamese or Chinese settlers, Buddhists or Christians, residents of Saigon have long paid enthusiastic tribute to one favorite southern, local hero--L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát--whose gorgeous shrine is located on Le Van Duyet street in Binh Thanh District. You will not able to find any other place in Hu·∫ø or Hanoi where the residents, regardless of ethnic or religious backgrounds, regard their own local hero with such reverence\\".Choi, pp. 53-54.

The castle was built on top of a steep hill dominating the surrounding terrain on 920 m altitude.  History  The castle was mentioned for the first time in a decree of Prince Lazar. In the early 15th century, Koznik belonged to Grand ƒåelnik Radiƒç, one of the most important knights at that time. Lazar's widow, Princess Milica spent some time there, in 1402, while their son, despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, made two decrees in Koznik in 1405, granting Radiƒç Postupoviƒá all surrounding villages and the church on the river Grabovniƒçica. After a brief Ottoman conquest of Koznik, the castle returned to despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá in 1444. The Ottomans again seized the castle at same time when they conquered Kru≈°evac in 1454-1455. During 16th and 17th century, an Ottoman squad was located there until 1689, when Koznik was taken hold of by Serbian rebels, which indicates that, at the time, Koznik was still an active fortification. Koznik is an example of a small highland fortified castle. It has an irregular polygonal base that follows the configuration of the terrain. South from the fort were other constructions, with some remnants still recognizable today.

It entered into force on 4 December 1969, and as of 2015 has been ratified by 186 parties. The Convention is applicable to offences against penal law and to any acts jeopardising the safety of persons or property on board civilian aircraft while in-flight and engaged in international air navigation. Coverage includes the commission of or the intention to commit offences and certain other acts on board aircraft registered in a Contracting State in-flight over the high seas and any other areas beyond the territory of any State in addition to the airspace belonging to any Contracting State. Criminal jurisdiction may be exercised by Contracting States other than the State of Registry under limited conditions, viz, when the exercise of jurisdiction is required under multilateral international obligations, in the interest of national security, and so forth. The Convention, for the first time in the history of international aviation law, recognises certain powers and immunities of the aircraft commander who on international flights may restrain any person(s) he has reasonable cause to believe is committing or is about to commit an offence liable to interfere with the safety of persons or property on board or who is jeopardising good order and discipline. In strictly domestic cases the Convention does not have application and acts and offences committed in the airspace of the State of Registry are excluded except when the point of departure or intended landing lies outside that State, or the aircraft enters into the airspace of a State other than the State of Registry as for example on a domestic flight which traverses the boundary of another State. Introduction Study of the question of the legal status of the aircraft had been the subject of debate from as early as the pioneering work of the French jurist Paul Fauchille in 1902 and had been frequently visited by early organisations such as, inter alia, the Comit√© International Technique d'Experts Juridiques A√©riensEstablished by the First International Conference on Private Air Law, Paris 1925; operated until 1947. (International Technical Committee of Aerial Legal Experts), the Institut de Droit International (Institute of International Law), the International Criminal Police Commission and the International Law Association.Lord Wilberforce, The International Technical Committee of Experts in Air Law, I International L.Q. p 498 (1947) The question remained as one of the most important legal problems until the 13-year-long pre-legislative efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization culminated in the Convention on Offenses and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft coming into force on 4 December 1969. > There are very few subjects connected with the law of the Air on which > lawyers have written so much or which they have discussed so often at > International Conferences as Crimes on Aircraft. > > ‚Äî J.

C.f. ICAO Doc. 7035-LC/128. The Committee appointed Dr. Enrique M. Loaeza (Mexico) as rapporteur on the subject. On 15 May 1953 the Council of ICAO raised the issue of the legal status and directed the Legal Commission to commence work on the matter.Action of the Council, 19th Session, 1953. ICAO Doc 7408-C/864, p 18. Accordingly, the Legal Council at its 9th Session, held at Rio de Janeiro 25 August to 12 September 1953 primarily to study and revise the text of a draft conventionDraft convention prepared by subcommittee in Paris January 1952. See ICAO News Release, 4 December 1952. intending to replace the Warsaw Convention, established a sub-committee on the Legal Status of the Aircraft.9th Session of the Legal Committee, Rio de Jainero 25 August to 12 September 1953. ICAO Doc 7450-LC/136, Vol I, Minutes, p XVIII, para 4(b). Legal Status of the Aircraft Sub-Committee The Legal Status of the Aircraft Sub-Committee formed by the ICAO Legal Committee during its 9th Session held at Rio de Jainero was dedicated to studying the problems associated with crimes on aircraft. During the 10th Session of the Legal Committee in 1954, the Sub-Committee held meetings to determine the best procedure to be followed in the further consideration of the legal problems involved in studying the legal status of the aircraft.International Conference on Air Law, August‚ÄìSeptember 1963 at Tokyo, ICAO Conference Doc No 5. It was established that consideration ought to be given to the physical circumstances wherever the aircraft might be when a crime occurred, further considering the effect upon applicable law. One of the important problems involved births: > Extract from ICAO News Release, 30 August 1956: Under Belgian law a birth > aboard a Belgian aircraft is considered to have taken place in Belgium. > Under British law a birth aboard a British aircraft is considered to have > taken place in Great Britain. However, if the aircraft is over French > territory at the time, the birth is considered under French law to have > taken place in France. In the latter case the child would thus have two > nationalities and perhaps even a third, that of its father, if the latter is > a national of a third State the laws of which provide that a child always > takes the nationality of its legitimate father. The situation would be quite > different, however, if the birth occurred aboard a French aircraft in flight > over the territory of a State other than France. A birth aboard a French > aircraft over Belgian territory is considered to have occurred in France > under both Belgian and French law. On the other hand, if the aircraft was > flying over British territory at the moment the birth took place., the birth > is considered by France to have taken place in British territory and by > Great Britain to have taken place in France. In this case the child would > have no nationality, unless the latter was determined by that of its > parents. Similar problems arise in the event of a crime. Offences committed > aboard a Belgian aircraft are considered to have been committed in Belgium > and are consequently governed by the Belgian penal code. However, if a > Belgian alrcraft was flying over Switzerland when an offence was committed, > the latter might also be subject to Swiss penal law which may provide > entirely different penalties. In addition to these legal difficulties, there > are also major difficulties of a physical nature. When it is established > that the territorial law is to apply to an act which occurs aboard an > aircraft and that the latter flew, successively, over the territory of > several States, it may be difficult, if not impossible, in view of the > normal cruising speed of modern aircraft, to establish the exact geographic > location where the act actually took place. Similarly, when a crime is > committed aboard an aircraft in flight, and its commission extends over a > period of time, it may be impossible to determine with certainty the State > over whose territory the various parts of the crime were perpetrated and to > specify the location where the parts deemed decisive under applicable law > were performed. Geneva Session, 1956 The Sub-Committee held its first plenary session in Geneva on 3 September 1956 armed with a list of the most important problems requiring an international solution. The Sub-Committee's work was greatly lessened by its agreement to limit the scope of the study to criminal aspects: > (1) acts which are crimes under the laws of the States of registration of > the aircraft and the law of the State in which the act occurred; > (2) acts which are crimes according to the law of one of the States > mentioned in (1) above. While the matter of damage caused by aircraft to third parties on the ground had been handled by the Rome Convention, problems such as the nationality of aircraft, rights aboard aircraft, births, deaths, marriages, conclusion of contracts, drawing up of wills aboard aircraft in flight, etc. remained. Montreal Draft, 1958 As a result of its study during its full second session done at Montreal in September 1958 the Sub-Committee developed the first ICAO Draft Convention on the Legal Status of the Aircraft12th Session of the Legal Committee, M√ºnich. Vol I.ICAO News Release 19 August 1959. focusing on the problem of crimes committed on board aircraft. On the conflict of laws, the jurisdiction of the State of Registry was provided for in Article 3(1), as was the jurisdiction of overflown territorial States subject to some conditions. Munich Draft, 1959 The Legal Committee at its 12th Session held in Munich considered the Draft Convention and Report of the September 1958 Sub-Committee session. The Munich Session had been intended to also examine the question of the Legal Status of the Aircraft Commander and a Draft Convention on Aerial Collisions. As a result of its Session in Munich the Legal Committee drew up a Draft Convention on Offences and Other Acts Occurring on Board Aircraft. The Draft was comprehensive in scope containing provisions at Article 3 for the principle of jurisdiction over crimes in aircraft, at Article 4 for security against offenders being tried twice, at Articles 5 to 8 on the duties and the rights of the aircraft commander, of the members of the flight crew and of the passengers, at Article 9 for the immunity of certain actions taken on board aircraft, and at Articles 10 and 11 for the obligations and the rights of Contracting States. The Draft provided for the jurisdiction of the overflown territorial State, for the State of Landing and for the State of Registration of the aircraft. Article 3(1) provided that \\"[i]ndependently of any applicable jurisdiction, the State of registration of the aircraft is competent to exercise jurisdiction over offences committed on board the aircraft.\\" This provision paralleled maritime law in favour of the unworkable maxim cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferosLord A.D. Nair, The Law of the Air (1964) and solved the problem of lex loci delicti commissi over the High Seas.

Article 3(2) dealt with the jurisdiction of the territorial State and the State of Landing, providing: > The criminal jurisdiction of a State in whose airspace the offence was > committed, if such State is not the State of registration of the aircraft or > the State where the aircraft lands, shall not be exercised in connection > with any offence committed on an aircraft in flight, except in the following > cases: :(a) if the offence has effect on the territory of such State; :(b) > if the offence has been committed by or against a national of such State; > :(c) if the offence is against the national security of such State; :(d) if > the offence consists of a breach of any rules and regulations relating to > the flight and man≈ìuvre of aircraft in force in such State; :(e) if the > exercise of jurisdiction is necessary to ensure the observance of any > obligation of such State under an international agreement. If the overflown territorial State is neither the State of Registry nor the State of Landing, its jurisdiction is limited by subparagraphs (a) ‚Äì (e). Subparagraph (a) was proposed by Fernand de Vissher at Article 1(3) of his 1937 report. Subparagraph (b) was proposed in Article 23 of the unadopted Draft Paris Convention of 1919 at the Peace Conference.Albert Roper, La Convention Internationale du 13 Octobre 1919 portant r√©glementation de la navigation a√©rienne, pp 155‚Äì156 (1930). OCLC, inter alia, 70941513. Subparagraph (c) on the principle of national security had been proposed by Paul Fauchille in 1902.Paul Fauchille, 19 Annuaire, p 19 (1902); 23 Annuaire, p 297. Subparagraph (d) corresponded to Article 23(2) of the Draft Paris Convention of 1919. Subparagraph (e) was therefore the only new concept. Article 3(2) empowered the State of Landing to exercise jurisdiction over offences committed on board an aircraft. Although it had been proposed by Fernand de Visscher at Article 1(4) of his 1937 report submitted to the Luxembourg Session of the Institut de Droit International.C.f. 44 Annuaire, p 19. The Munich Draft thus established a means for concurrent jurisdiction of the three States. \\"Proposals to include a system of priority in the Munich draft have failed, partly because of the difficulty in finding agreement on the order of priority among the States concerned, and partly because the question of priority would be governed largely by the extent to which extradition treaties existed.\\"G.F. Fitzgerald, Development of International Rules Concerning Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, Canadian Yearbook of International Law, C.B. Bourne (1963), pp 283‚Äì239. NCJ 063298 The Draft recognised, for the first time in the history of international air law, the power of the aircraft commander to take necessary action in the event that the safety of his aircraft and its passengers were jeopardised by the act of someone on board. It also recognised the commander's immunity were he to take some reasonable action under the circumstances. In addition it recognised the right of the commander to disembark any person endangering the safety of the flight or to deliver such person under restraint to the competent authorities of any Contracting State in which he may land; along with a provision for the country of disembarkation to detain the offending person according to its laws, to try him, to extradict him or to release him without delay. Further provisions dealt with hijackings. States would agree to return a hijacked aircraft to any person lawfully entitled to it and to detain the hijacker(s) under national law to be tried under a competent jurisdiction. Montreal Redraft, 1962 On 27 November 1961 the ICAO Council requested the Chairman of the Legal Committee to appoint a Sub- Committee on the Legal Status of the Aircraft to consider comments from States and from international organisations on the M√ºnich Draft of 1959.Action of the Council, 44th Session. ICAO Doc 8217-C/935, p 12. The Legal Committee acted accordingly with the Sub-Committee convening in Montreal from 26 March to 5 April 1962. The Sub-Committee made some changes and offered substitute provisions in addition to new ones. Rome Draft, 1962 During its 14th Session held in Rome in 1962 the Legal Committee after considering the Sub- Committee's report further studied and revised the Montreal Redraft. A Final Draft \\"Draft Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft\\" was prepared.Vol I, Minutes of the 14th Session of the ICAO Legal Committee. ICAO Doc 8302-LC/150-1, p XIX. The US representative considered the principle ne bis in idem (double jeopardy) would fail to contribute to the solution to conflicts of jurisdiction, causing the Committee to delete that provision. In addition to some other changes and drafting amendments the Montreal Redraft was retained. A new article dealing with the question of hijacking was introduced. The Legal Committee considered its latest draft suitable for submission to a diplomatic conference and, in line with Section 1 of the Legal Committee's procedure for approval of draft conventions, transmitted it together with a report to the Council. The Rome Draft was placed before the International Conference on Air Law, Tokyo, on 20 August 1963, thus concluding decades of debates and negotiations of some of the foremost outstanding problems in international air law. Tokyo Convention, 1963 The Conference was finally convened at Tokyo by ICAO Council, 20 August to 14 September 1963 for the purpose of further consideration, finalisation, adoption and opening for signature of the Rome Draft. Sixty-one States and five international organisations were represented at the Conference.Annual Report of the Council to the Assembly for 1963. ICAO Doc 8402-A 15-p, p. 96 (April 1964) During the discussions certain changes were made along with the addition of certain provisions, including the final clauses. The Tokyo Convention emerged in present form on 14 September 1963.ICAO Doc 8364 (ICAO eSHOP, International Conventions and Protocols) The Convention entered into force on 4 December 1969 bringing closure to the efforts of ICAO on the subject since 1950 and the realisation of many of the ideals of the early pioneering jurists present at the dawn of aviation. > But now we have one to 200 people flying together, commonly for four to > seven hours, at times for 12 to 15 hours.

The class 414 is one of the classes of the SPN ship project. These tankers have capacity of 600 tons and are used for oil transportation on the superficial rivers of Siberia (basically Lena River).  SPN-673  This tanker belonged to the Kirenskaya repair-operational base in Kirensk and was equipped for oil transportation. The captain of the vessel at the moment of incident was Bulgakov Victor Vasilevich. On October 13, 2009 the tanker, carrying a cargo of 496 tons of diesel fuel, was close to settlement Ichera on the Lena River when the steering refused to respond, causing the ship to run into a flooded barge. There were no injuries, after the cargo was swapped to the \\"Capitan Verkhoturov\\" tanker and sent to its destination, 18 people and 3 other vessels took part in refloating the ship. Initially it was believed the ship was not damaged, but after surveying the refloated ship it was found that the bottom of the ship and the empty storage tanks 11 and 12 were damaged. The ship was removed from the bank at 2:00 on October 16 and towed off for survey in Kirensk by steam-ship \\"Zcuya\\". As a result of the investigation into the circumstances of the incident it was found that a failure to report a danger by the steam-ship \\"Captain Ineshin\\" meant that the tanker hit the barge. The investigation determined three guilty parties: * The captain of tanker SPN-673 had withdrew from management of the vessel and had not transferred command of a vessel to the senior assistant. * The senior assistant SPN-673 did not promptly report the accident to the ship-owner and the emergency services. * The captain of the steam-ship \\"Captain Ineshin\\", had not given necessary warning about a dangerous area, and after the incident did not stop to provide assistance. All of them received fines, the money was spent by the Osetrovsky transport public prosecutor.  SPN-705  This tanker belonged to the Yakut river shipping company and had been equipped to transport natural gasoline traversing Indigirka and Moma River to deliver fuel from Belaya Gora to Moma Airport. On June 28, 1996 at 11:00 there was an explosion on the ship, causing a large fire. At 12:00 fire boats and auxiliary vessels from port Belaya Gora arrived along with fire-engines on the coast although the fire was not fully extinguished till 17.30. The explosion created a large hole in the tanker which sank shortly after the fire was put out. The fire caused the death of ship mechanic Victor Firstov, and captain of the tanker Jury Grabkin was severely wounded. The other 5 crew members were uninjured.

He wrote comedies, revues and songs. In his later years he wrote several memoir books from his life as a lawyer. Personal life Dybwad was born in Christiania as the son of bookseller Jacob Dybwad (1823‚Äì1899) and Anne Margrethe Gr√∏ntvedt Aabel (1831‚Äì1873). He was a brother of architect Peter Dybwad. He was married to actress Johanne Dybwad from 1891 to 1916, and to singer Bokken Lasson from August 1916. Both his wives are honoured with sculptures in Oslo. His son with Johanne, Nils Juell Dybwad, became a barrister. Nils married a sister of Carl Boye Semb and had the daughter Johanne \\"Hannemor\\" Dybwad, an alpine skier who married barrister Peder \\"Per\\" Gram. Career He finished his secondary education in 1881, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1886. After studying in Berlin and Paris, he was a junior solicitor in Kristiania for two years. In 1890 he opened his own lawyer's office, and from 1892 he was a barrister with access to working with Supreme Court cases. While studying he had written and played in the Norwegian Students' Society theatre. He later translated and wrote plays and operettes for Christiania Theater, Nationaltheatret and Centralteatret. Among his best known works is the musical comedy Ola Lia, written together with Olaf Krohn and staged in 1905 with Hauk Aabel in the leading role. The farce Verdens undergang followed in 1906 and Sterke M√¶nd in 1907, both at Centralteatret. After marrying Bokken Lasson in 1916, he started writing revue and cabarets for Chat Noir, several of which were issued in Bokken Lasson's 1920 book 67 Viser fra det gamle Chat Noir.

It was a pusher driven parasol winged monoplane. Only one was built. Development William Shackleton designed the Beardmore Wee Bee that won the first prize at the Lympne light aircraft trials#1924. He then set up in partnership with a fellow Australian, Lee Murray who wanted a machine of his own and had been impressed by the Curtiss- Wright Junior, a parasol-wing pusher driven two seater that had sold well in the United States. The influence of the Junior was clearly seen in the Shackleton-Murray SM.1, though in detail they were quite different. The SM.1 was a wooden-framed, fabric-covered parasol monoplane. The wing had constant chord and only slightly rounded tips, the latter built out of papier-m√¢ch√©. It carried a pair of narrow ailerons, inboard of which were wing-folding boxes, hinged sections of the trailing edge which could be lifted up to allow the wings to fold backwards against the fuselage. All four spars were identical and the pairs of ailerons and wingboxes were interchangeable to keep the costs of spares low. Pairs of V-shaped lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the two wing spars. There were pairs of tall centre section struts to the wing from the top longerons in front of and behind the rear cockpit, keeping the wing high enough to provide easy access. The rear pair also supported the front of the Hirth HM 60 four cylinder inverted in-line engine mounted on the underside of the wing, assisted by another pair at the rear of it. The Hirth drove a two-bladed pusher propeller. With the engine high amidships, the pusher arrangement allowed the fuselage to sit close to the ground, making cockpit access easy. The fuselage was deep in the nose, and the front cockpit well forward. The rear cockpit was under the forward part of the wing; dual controls were fitted. Behind the rear cockpit the fuselage became less deep, providing clearance for the propeller tips and further aft was quite slender. A conventional fin and balanced rudder carried the rectangular tailplane, with its split elevators, about halfway up and strut- braced from below. The undercarriage was a split-axle design, with the main legs attached to the upper longerons just behind the rear cockpit and with pairs of bracing struts from the lower longerons. Though the wheels were small in diameter, they used low-pressure tyres. Unusually, the rear wheel was not at the tail but halfway between the trailing edges of wing and rudder. The SM.1 was built by Airspeed, starting at their York works and following them down to Portsmouth Airport in 1933. The date of its first flight, made from Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield is not recorded, but in September 1933 it went from London Air Park, Hanworth to Martlesham Heath Airfield for certification.Flight 21 September 1933 p.968 Plans to put the SM.1 into production, using a Pobjoy R radial were announced in May 1933, but came to nothing. The sole SM.1, registered G-ACBP in January 1935Registration documents for G-ACBP was later sold to Lord Apsley of the Bristol and Wessex Aero Club, but came down in the sea off the Isle of Wight after the engine failed on 22 July 1936.

The other entrances to the bay are the North Passage and Jumpinpin Channel in the south. It was once the main entrance for ships entering the bay. South Passage begins in the shallow sand-barred channel between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island and continues along North Stradbroke Island past Amity Point to Dunwich. Crossing the channel by small boat is not recommended, especially during a high swell, due to the network of channels and shifting sand bars. The tidal flow is rapid with a rate of 150 cm per second during the flooding tide and slightly slower during the ebb tide of 100 cm per second. The passage has a return coefficient of 50%, meaning that half the amount of water that leaves the bay via the passage returns the same way on the flooding tide. History The channel was not noticed by Lieutenant James Cook as he explored the coastline in May 1770. On 14 July 1799, Matthew Flinders was the first European to discern an opening between the islands. In 1824 John Oxley aboard the Amity left Moreton Bay via the South Passage after he had explored the Brisbane River with Allan Cunningham. He was the first European sailor known to do so. The Lucinda was used as a mail vessel for delivering mail up and down the Queensland coast. The boat was largely captained by Captain James South who notably used South Passage to cut hours off the mail route. Some believed this is how South Passage came to be named, but it appears this is simply a coincidence.http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:206921/s00855804_1993_15_4_183.pdf There is clear reference to South Passage prior to Captain South surveying/sounding and using this route.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article36644376?searchTerm=%22moreton%20bay%22%20-brisbane&searchLimits;=l-title=Launceston+Examiner+(Tas....%7Ctitleid%3A74 On 11 March 1847, 44 people lost their lives when the SS Sovereign was wrecked as it passed through the passage; only 10 people were saved.

It is endemic to Tasmania where it is found on moist acidic soils at altitudes of 600 to 1200 m (2000‚Äì4000 ft). Telopea truncata is a component of alpine eucalypt forest, rainforest and scrub communities. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to a height of , or occasionally as a small tree to 10 m (35 ft) high, with red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appearing over the Tasmanian summer (November to February) and bearing 10 to 35 individual flowers. Yellow-flowered forms are occasionally seen, but do not form a population distinct from the rest of the species. Collected by French botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1792‚Äì93, Telopea truncata was first scientifically described in 1805. Genetic analysis revealed that the Tasmanian waratah is the most distinctive of the five waratah species. It can be cultivated in temperate climates, requiring soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available cultivars that are hybrids of T. truncata with the New South Wales waratah (T. speciosissima) and Gippsland waratah (T. oreades) have been developed. Description Yellow-flowered form in cultivation, Hobart The Tasmanian waratah is a large erect shrub up to in height with several stems, although it sometimes grows as a single-stemmed tree to 10 m (35 ft) high. Unlike the New South Wales waratah (T. speciosissima), which has a few stems topped with flowers, the stems of the Tasmanian waratah branch freely, with numerous smaller branches topped with flower heads. Younger branches and flower heads frequently have a coating of brownish hairs. The narrow adult leaves are long and across and have a rough texture. Spathulate (spoon-shaped) to obovate in shape, they have smooth, slightly down-curved margins. The undersurface of the leaves is hairy. Occasional lobed leaves are seen. Flowering occurs from October to January, and is related to altitude: plants at lower elevations flower earlier than ones higher up. The flower heads, known as inflorescences, are terminal‚Äîthat is, they arise on the ends of small branches‚Äîand are surrounded by small inconspicuous hairy bracts. This sets T. truncata apart from all other waratah species, which have hairless bracts. In the shape of a flattened raceme, the flower heads are in diameter and composed of 10 to 35 individual flowers. They are most commonly bright red, though scattered yellow-flowered plants occur. These were described as forma lutea but are mere colour variations and not genetically distinct. Yellow-flowered plants have both red- and yellow-flowered progeny. Anthesis is basipetal; that is, the flowers at the base (edges) of the flower head open first. The flower is composed of a 2 cm-long perianth on a 1 cm-long stalk, with a pronounced kink in the style above the ovary; all other waratah species have gently incurving styles. Anatomically, the individual flower bears a sessile anther (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the stigma at the end of the style. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pod then develops. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore. After flowering, the curved leathery to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5 cm (2 in) long. They split longitudinally to release the winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16 seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds from each other and the follicle walls. Taxonomy and evolution Plant with developing buds and a previous year's old seed pod While exploring Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1792‚Äì3, French botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re collected specimens of what he later formally described as Embothrium truncatum in his 1805 work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective truncatus, meaning \\"truncated\\" or \\"ending abruptly\\", referring to the end of the seed wing. This characteristic is not specific to the Tasmanian waratah; all members of the subtribe Embothriinae have truncate seed wings. Embothrium was a wastebasket taxon at the time, and Robert Brown proposed placing the species in a new genus, Telopea, in a talk he gave in 1809, publishing the new name Telopea truncata in 1810. Richard Salisbury had attended the talk and controversially published the species as Hylogyne australis, or southern hylogyne, in Joseph Knight's 1809 book On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, thus claiming precedence over Brown's formal 1810 description. Salisbury was involved in disputes with several prominent naturalists of the time, and his preemption of Brown was seen as unethical, so his names were largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of Brown's. James Ross described a new species of waratah, Telopea tasmaniana, in his Hobart Town Almanack in 1835, but it is now considered a synonym of T. truncata. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus Hylogyne on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the new combination Hylogyne truncata for T. truncata. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Telopea was nomenclaturally conserved over Hylogyne by the International Botanical Congress of 1905. Telopea truncata is one, and possibly the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that gives rise to the Gippsland waratah (T. oreades) and Monga waratah (T. mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T. truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red‚Äîthe surfaces facing the centre of the flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away. The genus is classified in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the tree waratahs (Alloxylon) from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and the South American genera Oreocallis and Embothrium. Almost all of these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely pre-dated the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. Propylipollis ambiguus (formerly Triporopollenites ambiguus) is the oldest identifiable member of the Embothriinae. It is known only from pollen deposits, and was originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of T. truncata, Alloxylon pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Fossil remains of Telopea truncata have been recovered from early to middle Pleistocene strata at Regatta Point in western Tasmania. The leaves are small, and these beds housed a subalpine plant community in what is now lowland terrain. Leaves identical to (and classified as) Telopea truncata have been recovered from early Oligocene deposits around Lake Cethana near Sheffield. Distribution and habitat The species is found in central, southern, and western Tasmania and is absent from warmer, dryer areas. It grows on moist acidic soils in wet sclerophyll forest or subalpine scrub at altitudes of 600 to 1200 m (2000‚Äì4000 ft). It is an understory component of subalpine forest stands of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and alpine yellow gum (E. subcrenulata), as well as Athrotaxis selaginoides‚ÄìNothofagus gunnii short rainforest, Athrotaxis selaginoides rainforest, Leptospermum- with-rainforest scrub, the tall Nothofagus‚ÄìAtherosperma rainforest and Nothofagus‚ÄìPhyllocladus short rainforest. It is occasionally found in the Leptospermum scoparium‚ÄìAcacia mucronata forest community of western Tasmania. Ecology The prominent position and striking colour of the flowers of T. truncata and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae in both Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. The flower heads produce abundant nectar, which is fed upon by many bird species. The Tasmanian waratah has a swollen woody base largely under the soil known as a lignotuber, which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a bushfire. Like most Proteaceae, T. truncata has fine proteoid roots that arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten‚Äîand destroyed‚Äîby animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants. Cultivation car park The flowers of the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird visitors to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington. Cultivars * Telopea 'Champagne' is a cultivar registered under plant breeders' rights (PBR) in 2006. Its creamy-yellow flowerheads appear from October to December. It is a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. * Telopea 'Golden Globe' is a cultivar registered under PBR in 2006. Larger than 'Champagne', it is also a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. It has been propagated and sold as 'Shady Lady Yellow'. It was originally bred in the Dandenongs east of Melbourne. Uses The flowers of T. truncata were once used extensively for decoration. Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that the collection of the flowers for this purpose had caused the decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. The timber of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.

Rabban is the Syriac term for monk. \\"Rabban\\" is also the Aramaic word for \\"teacher\\". He founded the Rabban Hormizd Monastery in Alqosh, named after him, which has served in the past as the patriarchate of the Church of the East. In the Church of the East and its schismatic branches, Rabban Hormizd is commemorated on the second Sunday after Easter. Life According to The histories of Rabban Hormizd the Persian and Rabban Bar-Idta, a text written by his disciple Simon before the 12th century, Hormizd was born at the end of the sixth or beginning the seventh century at Beth Lapat (in Sassanid ruled Assyria) from a rich or noble family, and at the age of eighteen he started to travel towards Scetes to become a monk there. On the way he met three monks of the Church of the East monastery of Bar Idta who urged him to become an inmate of their monastery, and he did so. He lived a hard, stern life. Hormizd lived in and near the Monastery of Bar Idta for thirty-nine years and in the monastery of Abba Abraham of Risha for six or seven years. When Hormizd was sixty-five or sixty-six, he left the monastery and passing out of the country of Marga went and settled down in the mountain of Beth 'Edhrai near the Chaldean town of Alqosh. When he had been there some little time the people in the neighbourhood offered to build him a monastery, the present Rabban Hormizd Monastery. The following part of the life of Rabban Hormizd is marked by episodes in which the saint opposed the monks of the Mar Mattai Monastery.

The CVA is a form of composition, similar to the personal IVA (individual voluntary arrangement), where an insolvency procedure allows a company with debt problems or that is insolvent to reach a voluntary agreement with its business creditors regarding repayment of all, or part of its corporate debts over an agreed period of time. The application for a CVA can be made by the agreement of all directors of the company, the legal administrators of the company, or the appointed company liquidator. Implementation A company voluntary arrangement can only be implemented by an insolvency practitioner who will draft a proposal for the creditors. A meeting of creditors is held to see if the CVA is accepted. As long as 75% (by debt value) of the creditors who vote agree then the CVA is accepted. All the company creditors are then bound to the terms of the proposal whether or not they voted. Creditors are also unable to take further legal actions as long as the terms are adhered to, and existing legal action such as a winding-up order ceases. During the CVA, payments are made in a single monthly amount paid to the insolvency practitioner. The fees charged by the insolvency practitioner will be deducted from these payments. The company is not required to fund any further costs. Companies House will register the fact the company is entering into a CVA and there will be a recording of it on its credit file. Overview In order to place a company into a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), there is a certain process that must be followed to assess viability for the arrangement and to set up this business recovery process. The CVA process involves: * Contact with an insolvency practitioner (IP) ‚Äì the company's current financial position will need to be discussed to discover the options available to help deal with issues. The IP will work with the company's directors to decide if a CVA is most appropriate. This consultation and any advice given will normally be free of charge. * Information gathering ‚Äì if it is decided that a CVA is the best way forward, the IP will be formally engaged to gather information and draft a proposal to be presented to the company's unsecured creditors. * The drafting of the CVA proposal ‚Äì the proposal will include a number of things such as:  How the financial difficulty arose/came about  Up to date information regarding the company's financial position including details of all assets and liabilities  How much the company can afford to pay on a monthly basis based on financial projections  How much it will pay a month which creditors will receive on a pro rata basis  The predicted duration of the CVA. * Review of the CVA draft proposal ‚Äì after the draft has been put together, the directors of the company entering into the agreement should review the proposal and make any necessary changes. Once agreed upon, a copy of the proposal is sent out to all creditors and shareholders. * CVA moratorium ‚Äì to reduce/avoid creditor pressure, an application can be made to the court for a CVA moratorium. If this is granted and put in place, it stops the company's creditors from taking legal action and provides breathing space to deal with any issues. A CVA moratorium is difficult to obtain so their use is rare but they can be very useful for insolvency practitioners dealing with CVAs. * An informal agreement with unsecured creditors ‚Äì an alternative to a CVA moratorium which can be easier to put in place is an informal agreement with unsecured creditors. It also puts a stop to legal action by the company's creditors before agreement of the CVA. Most insolvency practices will contact unsecured creditors immediately after appointment to inform them of the company's situation. They will also try to keep a working relationship between the company and their creditors so trading can continue and profit can be made in order to repay creditors. * Creditors' meeting ‚Äì there should be a minimum of 14 days‚Äô notice given to creditors and shareholders prior to this meeting. It is not obligatory for a director to attend the meeting and creditors can vote in person or via a proxy, such as by post or email. At least 75% of creditors need to vote in favour of the proposal to approve it. If it is not acceptable, the proposal will need to be revised and resubmitted for approval. * There will be a second creditors' vote where connected creditors are excluded. A connected creditor could be a director or employee owed money from the company. At this meeting, 50% of creditors will need to vote in favour in order for the CVA proposal to be approved. * After approval, the CVA will begin ‚Äì the CVA will be put in place and payments, at the agreed monthly amounts, will start. The insolvency practitioner will collect money monthly and distribute it to creditors on a pro-rata basis. The terms of the CVA are binding for the company and its creditors for its duration and creditors will not be able to pursue the company legally if the agreement is adhered to. * Part of the proposal may involve one or more lump-sum payments (e.g. on receipt of an anticipated insurance claim or perhaps on completion of a large contract). * The end of the agreement ‚Äì a CVA will finish at the end of the agreed term if all payments have been made and conditions within the proposal have been followed. At the end of the CVA period, if there is debt outstanding, it may be written off or in some circumstances the CVA can be extended. Creditors can receive anything from 1p to 100p in the pound. Potential benefits Companies can benefit from a CVA in numerous ways: * Improves cash flow, quickly. * Stops pressure from tax while the CVA is being prepared. * Stops a winding-up petition and gets it adjourned. * Can rapidly cut costs. * Can terminate employment, leases and onerous supply contracts. * Terminates property lease obligations. * Terminates directors‚Äô and/or managers‚Äô contracts. * Removes employees with no redundancy payments or lieu-of-notice costs. * Terminates onerous customer/supplier contracts. * Board and shareholders generally remain in control of the company. * Has much lower costs than administration and is not publicly announced like administration is. * Is a good deal for creditors as they retain the customer and receive some of their debt back over time. Role of directors Within a CVA, directors retain control of the business. Directors have a legal duty to act properly and responsibly and to prioritise the interests of their creditors. The risks of liquidating a business may include disqualification from acting as a director of other companies and also personal reputation as a director. In an extreme case directors can be found personally liable to contribute towards the shortfall in payments to creditors. However, as a company voluntary arrangement is in the best interests of creditors, there is no investigation into the director's conduct. Under a company voluntary arrangement directors are not personally liable for the company's debts, unless they have given a personal guarantee. Even if a director has provided a guarantee, a CVA will mean a director is only liable if the company cannot pay and by continuing in business there is a retained source of income.

It was demolished around 1870 but survives in the name of a (minor) local road ‚Äì Simpson's Place. History of the site Simpson's Place, c. 1800. Historical records show that the site belonged to the \\"Bankewell\\" (aka \\"Banquelle\\" or \\"de Banquelle\\") family as far back as 1302 (during the reign of Edward I) with John de Bankewell holding a charter of free warren to his lands there. His descendant Thomas de Bankewell is recorded as dying as a fief in 1352 (during Edward III's reign). The land eventually passed to the Clark family, and during the reign of Henry V (1413‚Äì1422) William Clark applied for a license to build a fortified manor house with crenellated walls and a deep moat (the latter being recorded as \\"supplied and nourished with a living spring\\").Clinch, p28-29. John Simpson acquired the manor in the latter part of the reign of Henry VI (r. 1422‚Äì1461), made improvements to the site and gave his name to it. His descendant Nicholas Simpson (fl. 1530‚Äì1541) was the barber to Henry VIII and featured in the painting \\"Henry VIII Presenting a Charter to the Barber Surgeons Company\\" by Hans Holbein the younger.Now in the National portrait gallery It is thought that he had a \\"huge and very handsome red-brick chimney\\" added to the house.An account of 1868 mentions a \\"huge and very handsome redbrick chimney\\", probably built around the time of Henry VIII and still extant 50‚Äì60 years before the time of writing. See Walford, p93. The manor eventually passed from Nicholas Simpson to Alexander Bassett to Sir Humphrey Style of Langley, esquire and Sheriff of Kent, (d. 1557), the estate being then held in a form of tenure called socage. It remained in the Styles family until the death of another Sir Humphrey StyleDescribed as a \\"Gentleman of the Privy chamber to King James and cup bearer to King Charles I\\" by William Betham in The Baronetage of England, Vol. 1 (1801), p295. in 1659. Over, the succeeding century or so, it passed through the hands of several other families and was converted into a farmhouse sometime previous to 1796,Lysons (see \\"further reading\\"), published in 1796, stated that the manor house was currently being occupied as a farm. eventually falling into disrepair and being demolished around 1870.Freeman, pp96 ff.Clinch, pp28 ff. The original Manor House According to Dunkin.Dunkin pp37-38. the original castle-like manor house was probably square in shape with fortified crenellated walls surrounded on all sides by a deep moat. Access was by a drawbridge on the northern side. The foundations of the walls were of \\"large flints intermixed with stone and cemented with strong lime mortar\\".Dunkin, p37 and there were strong buttresses securing the angles into the moat. The Lord of the domain would have lived in apartements either within the outer walls or, more likely, in a separate structure within the central courtyard ‚Äì the latter would have been more defensible. There was also a small terrace projecting from the eastern side of the house. Topographically, the house was situated \\"under the brow of a low hill\\" which would not have been the best location from the point of view of defence.Warren The 19th century Manor House An account written in 1815 by Dunkin describes the existing manor house as formed of brick and timber, with evidence to suggest that it had been built in the 16th century on the foundations of a much older structure. Many of the original 16th century features were still apparent ‚Äì such as the old fireplace in the hall, the original doorways, and wainscotting ‚Äì but they were \\"much disfigured\\" by alterations carried out some years beforehand to convert the manor to a farmhouse. The northern and western sections of the moat had by then been filled in by the tenant, Jeremiah Ringer ‚Äì who gives his name to the present nearby \\"Ringer's road\\". There was also a suggestion, at the time, that the manor was haunted, with unexplained noises \\"being heard in and about the house\\" as if furniture was being dropped and broken. There were also reported ghostly sightings of a lady in white accompanied by a gentleman in dark clothes and a wide-brimmed hat.Dunkin, p38. A later account of 1831 by Henry Warren suggested that the building was remote from the public road and little known, but well worthy of notice due to its antiquity and picturesque quality. However the structure had by then fallen into a poor state of repair, evidenced by a review which described Simpson's Place as \\"an ancient edifice now condemned to be pulled down\\".The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 97 (1827) Freeman, writing a few years later in 1838, also described the manor house as \\"timestricken\\", the rooms being \\"exceedingly large and lofty\\" and the staircases \\"very wide. He also confirmed its derelict state.Freeman pp98 ff. Present day The former site of Simpson's manor house is now partially occupied by a Quaker meeting house at the junction of Ringer's road and Ravensbourne road.

Nearby barangays are Commonwealth, Batasan Hills and Bagong Silangan. History The name Payatas derived from the word payat sa taas (), which means the soil located in the upper part of Tullahan River is not good for planting rice. It is divided into three local government areas called barangays in the Philippines. They are known simply as the Payatas A, B, C. Barangay 81 is the original name of Payatas. Payatas is the only barangay established under judiciary rule. Physical features Located northeast of Quezon City, Barangay Payatas occupies a little less than twenty percent (20%) of the city‚Äôs land area and has about fifteen percent (15%) of the city‚Äôs total population. These figures are hotly disputed by academic surveys, however, given that Payatas is far more densely populated than the rest of Quezon City and much of Manila. The Census says there are just under 120,000 people living in Barangay Payatas, though academic studies suggest the real figure, given that most people are squatters are therefore do not own the land they're living on and are not included in official figures, is closer to 500,000 (Gaillard and Cadag, 2009; Bernardo, 2004; among others). Payatas shares a border with La Mesa Dam to the north, Barangay Bagong Silangan to the east, Barangay Batasan Hills to the south, and Barangay Commonwealth to the west (see Map 1). Until today, about a third of the land in various parts of Payatas is being claimed in disputes between the municipalities of Montalban and San Mateo, as well as the barangays of Commonwealth and Fairview. Land area and land use Payatas is characterized by a steep and sloping terrain, crisscrossed by creeks, rivers, ravines, and low-lying areas near the Marikina River. A fault line runs through its eastern boundary. A large part of the area is classified as medium residential zone that includes housing subdivisions, depressed or informal settlements, and undeveloped areas. Covering a total land area of 774 hectares, a greater portion of Payatas is privately owned (681 ha, or 88%; see Chart 1). Government-owned land, which includes the four-hectare national government complex (NGC) and the Quezon City property, covers a smaller portion (12%; 93 hectares) of the total land area. While portions of the privately owned area were already developed into residential subdivisions, a vast area (80%) has yet to be fully developed. Nonetheless, despite the poor access and lack of services and facilities, these areas continue to attract a large number of informal settlers from various areas of Metro Manila. Around the 1970s, upon the initiative of a former barangay official, Barangay Payatas was divided into two major settlement clusters (Area A and Area B) to organize the route of public vehicles. Each area, with its large population and land area, was further subdivided to allow for easier information dissemination and reporting to and from the barangay (see Table 1 below). The larger Area B is further subdivided into Groups 1 to 13 and Phases I to IV in Lupang Pangako, consisting of around 5,000 families where the poorest of the poor are located.  Payatas Dumpsite  Payatas dumpsite, 2007 Payatas is known for its former dumpsite which was closed in 2010. A landslide in the area caused the national legislation which banned open ground dump sites in the Philippines. A more regulated dumping ground was established adjacent to the old landfill in 2011, but the site was also closed in 2017. Sports Payatas is still a very poor area and many foundations operate in Payatas to help improve the opportunities of residents. This includes, notably, the Fairplay For All Foundation. Fairplay run an Alternative Learning Center, a Sports Center, and a Cafe to holistically develop the community through social enterprise, safe spaces, and quality education. Each program is run in part by local residents. Several of the football players have also represented the country in the National Youth Team and for Team Philippines in the Street Child World Cup. Overall, Payatas Football Club has won more than 40 trophies between them.

The inclusion of numerous anecdotes about how the eggs he collected personally were obtained, with notes on the birds and their habitats as well as the many photographs of people and activities related to the collecting, add autobiographical and historical dimensions to the work. The author says in his preface: > The Collection which is described in this Volume, is the result of twenty- > four years continuous work, as I commenced it in the year 1883; and a clutch > taken in that year (Data No.216) may be considered as the nucleus of the > enterprise.

In 1906 Jackson sold his collection to H.L. White, a wealthy pastoralist of \\"Belltrees\\", an extensive grazing property near Scone, New South Wales, who had financed the publication of Jackson's catalogue. Not only did Jackson's collection form a key part of the H. L. White Collection, but in 1907 White employed Jackson as curator of the collection as well as a collector whom he sent on several quests around Australia to further expand it. Jackson remained in White's employment until White's death in 1927 when the egg collection passed to the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne.

This could easily be a hit; or, rather, the first couple of minutes could.

The video features Diamandis and two girls with origami limbs and torso dancing in a spotlight with a white screen. In the second verse, Diamandis sings into a microphone on a stand. It begins with Diamandis standing without lighting and stomping her origami legs to the beat of the music. When the lighting comes on, Diamandis begins singing and moving her origami legs; two female dancers with the same legs appear and dance with her. After the repeat of the chorus, Diamandis is shown with her origami torso, bouncing up and down while singing the third verse. While the music continues in the song, Diamandis and the dancers dance with all limbs in origami form. The video ends with the lighting of the set going out and they all stand as Diamandis was in the beginning.

It was written by Arnthor Birgisson and Ina Wroldsen and produced by the former. Alongside Birgisson, Lewis was involved with the song's vocal production. Lyrically, it is about life after the end of a relationship. The strings were performed by Urban Soul Orchestra, who were led by Simon Fischer. \\"My Hands\\" was selected as the official theme song for the English version of the video game Final Fantasy XIII. Lewis decided to accept the offer of her track being used as she felt as though she was connected with the video game's female protagonist, Lightning. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics, who described it as forgettable, despite noting that Lewis performs the song undeniably well. In March 2010, \\"My Hands\\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 145. Background and production \\"My Hands\\" was recorded for Lewis's second studio album, Echo, which was released in November 2009.

Both Lewis's vocals and the instrumentation for the track were recorded by Seth Waldmann at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, United States, Dean Street Studios in London, England and The Vault in Stockholm, Sweden. Birgisson and Lewis carried the vocal production. The strings were performed by Urban Soul Orchestra, who were led by Simon Fischer; they were arranged and conducted by Stephen Hussey. Additionally, the strings were recorded and engineered by Rich Cooper at British Groove Studios in London.

Composition and critical reception Lasting for a duration of , \\"My Hands\\" is a song about \\"life after the end of a relationship.\\" It is composed in the key of D major using common time and is 80 beats per minute. Andy Gill for The Independent listed it as one of the top four tracks to download from Echo, along with \\"Happy\\", \\"Lost Then Found\\" and \\"Brave\\". A reviewer for CBBC's Newsround labelled the song, along with another track from the album called \\"Broken\\", as \\"pretty forgettable.\\" The reviewer continued to write that although Lewis's performs the songs undeniably well, they do not stand out compared to \\"Happy\\" and \\"I Got You\\". Michael Cragg for musicOMH wrote that the chorus of \\"My Hands\\" \\"erupts\\" and \\"bludgeons the listener into submission\\" and that its meaning becomes overshadowed. Usage in media \\"My Hands\\" was selected as the official theme song for the trailer of Final Fantasy XIII. The video game was first released in Japan on 17 December 2009, which uses a different theme song called \\"Kimi Ga Iru Kara\\", written by Masashi Hamauzu and sung by Sayuri Sugawara. However, international versions produced by NTSC and PAL feature \\"My Hands\\" as the official theme song. Gabriel Zamora for Examiner.com wrote that despite sounding \\"loud\\" compared to Hamauzu's song, \\"My Hands\\" suits the nature of the video game and \\"seems to fit well.\\" She continued to write that fans had hoped that \\"My Hands\\" would not replace \\"Kimi Ga Iru Kara\\" completely, instead wanting a new track called \\"Eternal Love\\" to be the official theme song. Although, she noted that the use of Lewis's track for the entirety of the trailer seemed to make this an \\"unlikely\\" notion. As part of promotion for the video games release, Lewis recorded a promotional advert for Square Enix (the video game's developer and publisher) and spoke about how she was happy to have been approached about the use of \\"My Hands\\" on the trailer and that it had some personal meaning. She said \\"I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.

It was the only U.S. company building modern streetcars‚Äîas distinct from light rail cars or new replicas of historic streetcars‚Äîuntil 2013, when Brookville received its first order for a modern (as opposed to faux historic) streetcar, for the Dallas Streetcar.\\"Dallas signs Liberty deal\\" (May 2013). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 166. UK: LRTA Publishing. United Streetcar was a limited liability company and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oregon Iron Works, Inc. (OIW), which has been in business since 1944. It was originally reported to have been established in early 2007, after OIW was the successful bidder for a contract to construct a prototype streetcar for the city of Portland, but in 2010 the company clarified that it had been formed in December 2005. The company completed its first streetcar in 2009. It was dissolved in February 2015.  History  Oregon Iron Works, a specialized manufacturer of complex structural components and systems, began considering entering the field of streetcar manufacturing in 2004, after realizing that the Portland Streetcar system had purchased vehicles built only by foreign manufacturers, possibly due to the absence of any U.S.-based manufacturers of modern streetcars. Portland in July 2009 In 2005, Congress approved a federal transportation spending bill which included a US$4 million grant to TriMet for the acquisition, on behalf of the city of Portland, of a prototype domestically manufactured streetcar. With a goal of fostering the domestic production of modern streetcars, the grant had been added into the $286 billion spending bill by Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio, but did not specify a particular company to be the recipient. In August 2006, the city of Portland issued a Request for Proposals for the provision of a prototype low- floor streetcar compatible with Portland Streetcar's existing fleet.City Council Ordinance 180788 (February 28, 2007). City of Portland. In anticipation of this, OIW signed a \\"technology transfer agreement\\" in February 2006 with ≈†koda, the Czech company which had built Portland's first seven streetcars, in order to permit OIW to manufacture a streetcar to the existing ≈†koda 10T design but with mostly U.S. components and assembly.\\"Streetcar building: Back in the U.S.A.\\" (2009, 3rd quarter). Passenger Train Journal, p. 41. ISSN 0160-6913. Only two formal proposals were received by the city, and after that of the other bidder was \\"deemed not to have met the minimum requirement\\", the contract was awarded to Oregon Iron Works, in January 2007. OIW then announced that it had created a new subsidiary, United Streetcar, LLC, to handle streetcar manufacturing. The value of the contract was $3.2 million, with the balance of the special $4 million federal grant being used to fund the city's costs to administer the grant and oversee the project.  Prototype vehicle completion  Construction of the prototype streetcar was undertaken at OIW's Clackamas facility (one of two OIW manufacturing facilities). The car was completed in June 2009 and was introduced to the public and the media at a ceremony held in Portland's South Waterfront district on July 1, 2009. Numbered 015 in the Portland Streetcar fleet, it was the first modern streetcar built in the United States since 1952, since the last PCC streetcar for the San Francisco Municipal Railway. It uses the ≈†koda 10T design, under license from the Czech manufacturer, and is model variant 10T3.\\"United Streetcar ... US manufacturer established for new trams\\". (April 2007). Tramways & Urban Transit, p. 146. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK) The propulsion equipment--the motors and electronic control system--were fabricated by ≈†koda, but installation took place at OIW‚Äôs/United Streetcar‚Äôs plant in the United States, and most other components were fabricated by United Streetcar or supplied by other U.S. companies. Overall, the prototype streetcar has about 70 percent U.S. content, enough to make the car's procurement compliant with federal \\"Buy America\\" provisions (). As with the earlier, Czech-built versions of the ≈†koda 10T, the United Streetcar 10T3 is a four-axle, bi-directional, low-floor streetcar with three doors on each side and wheelchair ramps extending (on demand) from one door per side. It is long and wide and has a maximum speed of . In 2010, the company dropped the 10T3 designation in favor of a new model designation, \\"100\\", in connection with a decision to use different propulsion equipment in future orders, as described below.Morgan, S.J. (November 2010). \\"United Streetcar gears up for series production\\". Tramways & Urban Transit, p. 406.  Change in propulsion system  In 2010, the city of Portland decided to amend its contract with United Streetcar/Oregon Iron Works, to replace the prototype car's ≈†koda-made propulsion-control system with a new system to be designed by Rockwell Automation, a U.S. company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The propulsion system is the high-tech electronic equipment which controls and coordinates the operation of the car's motors and other key operating components. Car 015's propulsion-control system was made by ≈†koda, whereas all 10 earlier Portland streetcars--even the seven cars built by ≈†koda--had control systems supplied by ELIN EBG Traction, an Austrian company (and only installed by ≈†koda). During acceptance testing of car 015 in late summer and autumn 2009, certain (unspecified) problems were encountered, and ≈†koda and Portland Streetcar were unable to reach agreement on resolving them. This issue, together with a desire by PS, United Streetcar and others to increase further the U.S. content of streetcars built by United Streetcar, led to discussions between Rockwell Automation and the various interested parties in Portland on the possibility and feasibility of Rockwell designing a control system for the United Streetcar design. In April 2010, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approved a $2.4-million grant, to be matched by $600,000 in local money, to fund the replacement of car 015's control equipment with new equipment to be designed by Rockwell Automation. The intention was that, if the partnership with Rockwell proved successful, eventually all streetcars built by United Streetcar would use the U.S.-made Rockwell propulsion system. It was stated that the change would increase the overall U.S. content of the car from around 70% to around 90%, and this was the main factor in gaining federal officials' approval of the $2.4 million in \\"research funds\\" needed to allow project to proceed. Prototype streetcar 015 was transported back to the OIW/United Streetcar factory in May 2010,Tramways & Urban Transit, August 2010, p. 313. LRTA Publishing (UK). to await design and then installation of the Rockwell system. With the installation completed in late 2011, it returned to the Portland Streetcar carhouse on April 30, 2012, to begin acceptance testing.Tramways & Urban Transit, July 2012, p. 276. LRTA Publishing (UK). It entered service on September 22, 2012\\"Portland Opens New Line\\" (November 2012). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 409.however, since 2012, issues still plagued car 015 and it is currently sitting in the Portland Streetcar yard unused in day to day operations.  Cars constructed  The first production-series United Streetcar-built streetcar, Portland's car 021, entered service in 2013. In spring 2009, the city of Portland announced that it had chosen United Streetcar for an order of six streetcars for a planned expansion of the Portland Streetcar system to the city's east side, and a $20 million contract for this order was signed in August 2009. In light of Portland's subsequent dissatisfaction with the ≈†koda propulsion system, the city decided in 2010 to modify the OIW/United Streetcar contract for these six cars, to substitute equipment from Elin EBG Traction for the originally planned ≈†koda equipment, which delayed their completion. The cars would receive motors supplied by Siemens, which has a U.S. factory, instead of by ≈†koda. In mid-2011, the order was reduced from six cars to five; purchase of a sixth car was reinstated in 2014.Tramways & Urban Transit, April 2014, p. 176. LRTA Publishing (UK). These were United Streetcar model \\"100\\". Delivery began in January 2013, and the first car entered service on June 11, 2013. The City of Tucson signed a $26 million contract with United Streetcar on June 7, 2010, ordering seven streetcars\\"Sun Link streetcar construction begins in Tucson\\", Railway Gazette, April 13, 2012. Retrieved on September 8, 2013. for the Sun Link modern streetcar line that opened July 25, 2014. An eighth car was added to the order in 2012. The original announcement was made in May 2009, but the Tucson project was still awaiting FTA approval at that time. FTA approved the plans in late September 2009 and (jointly with the US DOT) granted $69 million in early 2010 to help complete the project. The Tucson cars are model variant 200, the main difference from model 100 being a more powerful air-conditioning system. The first streetcar for Sun Link arrived in Tucson on August 30, 2013. In April 2012, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, in Washington, D.C., placed an order for two model 100 streetcars for use on the DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning Road line, under construction for opening in 2015, and the order was expanded to three cars in August 2012. The three cars were delivered between January 2014 and June 2014.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, July 2014, p. 305. All three orders were completed in 2014, the last car being delivered to Portland in November of that year. Demise The delays with the car deliveries, as well as teething issues experienced with the cars in service created tensions with the company's clients. In 2011, the company was working on a model 300 design that would have included the capability to operate away from the overhead wires, but it never reached production, and competitor Brookville Equipment Corporation completed such a design by 2013. As a relative newcomer to the market, with a single design offering, United Streetcar found it difficult to compete with more well- established builders such as Siemens and Bombardier. Consequently, the company received no further orders, and ceased production after the final car was delivered, mothballing its facilities in December 2014. United Streetcar president Kevin Clarke left the company that same month. In February 2015, after United Streetcar had declined to produce an annual report, the Oregon Secretary of State's office acted to administratively dissolve the company,United Streetcar LLC Corporation Division, Oregon Secretary of State's office. but formal dissolution did not take place until December 22, 2018. Parent Oregon Iron Works has re-purposed the U.S. facilities for boat construction, though the company has stated that they may return to rail-based equipment in the future (streetcars or otherwise).

Career Nissen was born in Stokke, and grew up in Torstrand (Larvik). He took his examen artium in 1943, and since this was during World War II the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Nissen fled Norway to join the resistance movement. He travelled to England via Sweden in 1944, and joined the Royal Norwegian Air Force-in-exile. He was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940 ‚Äì 1945 and the Legion of Merit. Nissen continued in the Air Force after the war, and graduated from the Norwegian Air Force Academy in 1951. He held several leadership positions; among others he served as leader for a contingent of Norwegian forces participating in the Congo Crisis. His last position in the Air Force was that of aerial attach√© in Washington, DC from 1973 to 1975. Nissen then embarked on a civil career. In 1975 he became manager of the newly established company Offshore Helicopters, which merged with Helikopterservice already in 1977. Nissen was then the chief executive officer of Fred.

Sp√≥rna, P. Wierzbicki: S≈Çownik w≈Çadc√≥w Polski i pretendent√≥w do tronu polskiego, Krak√≥w 2003, p. 85, 165, 282, 283 and 451. In 1310 he gave to his sons the districts of Warsaw and Czersk. Also High duke of Poland twice (1288, 1289). Life Early years He was younger son of Siemowit I of Masovia and Pereyaslava, a Rus' princess, who was according to some historians a daughter of Prince Daniel of Halych or according to other his distant relative. He was born around 1253-1258. Nothing is known from Boles≈Çaw II's first years, except that in 1262 he wasn't with his father and older brother Konrad II during the siege and battle of Jazd√≥w, where Siemowit I was killed and Konrad II was captured by the Lithuanians. Because Boles≈Çaw II was too young to rule by himself, the regency was exercised by his mother Pereyaslava and his late father's ally, Boles≈Çaw the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland, until 1264, when his brother Konrad II was liberated and returned to assume the government. Duke of P≈Çock When Boles≈Çaw II attained his majority in 1275, he demanded from his brother his part over their paternal inheritance. As a result, he received the western part of Masovia, with his capital in P≈Çock. However he was not satisfied with this distribution, evidenced in his long-standing conflict with Konrad II; during this fight, Boles≈Çaw II did not hesitate to ask for the help from the murderers of his father, the Lithuanians. The alliance between Boles≈Çaw II and Lithuania was strengthened in 1279 when he married Gaudemantƒó, the daughter of Grand Duke Traidenis, who in her baptism took the name of Sophia. Another ally of Boles≈Çaw II was his cousin W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, who was then Duke of Kujawy. The war between Boles≈Çaw II and Konrad during the second half of the 1270s and the first half of the 1280s didn't benefit any party, only causing destruction in extended parts of Masovia. Death of Leszek II the Black. Fighting for Krak√≥w and Sandomierz On 30 September 1288 Leszek II the Black died childless. Part of the local nobility, led by Pawe≈Ç of Przemankowo, Bishop of Krak√≥w and the Top√≥r family supported the succession of Boles≈Çaw II. However, he wasn't the only candidate for the Seniorate. Henryk IV Probus, Duke of Wroc≈Çaw, also advanced his claims. At first, it seemed that Boles≈Çaw II was able to master Lesser Poland without obstacles, as his troops in 1288 captured Krak√≥w and Sandomierz. However, later in the same year he was expelled from Krak√≥w by the troops of Henryk IV Probus, who gained the decisive favor of the castellan Sulk the Bear (pl: Su≈Çk z Nied≈∫wiedzia), who opened the gates of Wawel Castle to him. After this victory, Henryk IV Probus returned to Wroc≈Çaw, and Boles≈Çaw II managed to say in Sandomierz. In early February 1289 a coalition of Piast princes (Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w, Przemko of ≈öcinawa and Bolko I of Opole) organized an expedition to Krak√≥w with the purpose of consolidating the rule of Henryk IV Probus. At the sime time Boles≈Çaw II, who still wanted to recover Krak√≥w, organized a coalition with W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high and Casimir II of ≈Åƒôczyca, Unexpectedly, he also received the support of his brother Konrad II and Kievan Rus' troops. In this way, Boles≈Çaw II was able to organized a powerful army with the main objective of reconquering the Seniorate. The army of Henryk IV Probus withdrew from Krak√≥w, and on 26 February the bloody Battle of Siewierz took place, which ended with the defeat of Henryk IV's allies; during the fight, was killed Przemko of ≈öcinawa and Bolko I of Opole was captured. After the battle, Boles≈Çaw II occupied Krak√≥w, where he triumphantly entered in the summer of 1289. Shortly after, he gave Sandomierz to his brother Konrad II as they had previously accorded in exchange of his military support. This action caused outrage among the Lesser Poland nobility (accustomed to see the Duke of Krak√≥w reign over Sandomierz), who utterly refused to recognize Boles≈Çaw II as their ruler, and proclaimed W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high as the new Duke of Krak√≥w. For unknown reasons, Boles≈Çaw II refused to fight and retreated to his domains in P≈Çock, and in August 1289 W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high was in turn expelled by Henryk IV Probus, who became in the new ruler over Krak√≥w and Sandomierz. The only positive aspect of this struggle for the throne of Krak√≥w was the reconciliation with his brother Konrad II. Unification of Masovia; last years Boles≈Çaw II's wife Sophia died in 1288. His second marriage was, like the first one, contracted for political reasons. The chosen bride was Princess Kunigunde, sister of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia; the wedding took place in the first half of 1291. Thanks to this union, the Bohemian King neutralized the claims of the Duke of P≈Çock over the Seniorate, especially when he was able to conquer Krak√≥w in 1291. Boles≈Çaw II also wanted to strengthen his position with Wenceslaus II, so he didn't hesitate when in 1292 he helped his brother-in-law in his war against W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. The alliance between Masovia and Bohemia did not last very long. In 1294 Konrad II died without male offspring, so Boles≈Çaw II became the sole ruler over all Masovia. Feeling stronger, he broke relations with the Kingdom of Bohemia and reestablished relations with W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. In 1295 Przemys≈Ç II became King of Poland. The following year, after his assassination, Boles≈Çaw II supported W≈Çadys≈Çaw I in his brief war against Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w for the succession in Greater Poland. The hostile policy towards the Kingdom of Bohemia forced Wenceslaus II to launch an attack against Masovia. Despite the siege and destruction of P≈Çock, Boles≈Çaw II didn't change his political course, evidenced by his refusal to recognize Wenceslaus II as King of Poland in 1300 and the repudiation of his wife Kunigunde, who was sent back to Prague in 1302. In the early 1300s Boles≈Çaw II founded the stronghold of Warsaw, contributing to its development in detriment of the nearby Czersk. After 1305 Boles≈Çaw II was not present in any more political activity. The next information about him took place in 1310, when he granted two separate districts to his eldest two sons: Siemowit II received Warsaw and Trojden I received Czersk. In 1311, Borzys≈Çaw becomes his Chancellor. Boles≈Çaw II died on 20 April 1313 in Wyszogr√≥d and was buried at P≈Çock Cathedral. Marriages and Issue In 1279 Boles≈Çaw II married firstly to Gaudemantƒó (baptized as Sophia; d. 1288), a daughter of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania.Robert Frost, The Oxford History of Poland- Lithuania:Vol I, The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569, (Oxford University Press, 2015), 28.

They had two children:Older historiography attributed a third child to Boles≈Çaw II and Kunigunde, a daughter called Bertha, who became a nun in the Benedictine monastery in Prague (O. Balzer: Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 446); however, recent research showed that Bertha was in fact a dwarf give to Kunigunde by her husband as a servant, who followed her to Prague and joined in the monastery with her (K.

In his book The Biology of Belief, he claims that beliefs control human biology rather than DNA and inheritance. Lipton's extraordinary claims have not received attention from mainstream science. Biography Lipton received a B.A. in biology from C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University in 1966 and a PhD in developmental biology from the University of Virginia in 1971. From 1973 to 1982, he taught anatomy at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine, before joining St. George's University School of Medicine as a professor of anatomy for three years. Lipton has said that sometime in the 1980s, he rejected atheism and came to believe that the way cells function demonstrates the existence of God. From 1987 to 1992, Lipton was involved in research at Pennsylvania State University and Stanford University Medical Center. Since 1993, he has been teaching in non-tenured positions at primarily alternative and chiropractic colleges and schools. Lipton has stated \\"When I first started back in the 70s and my research was coming out, it was the golden age of genes. My research irritated a lot of people. I always thought of them as lemmings running off the cliff of DNA and I'm standing there on the side with the results from my stem-cell studies thinking, 'Oh my God, you're all going the wrong way. At some point I realised that they marginalised my work because it didn‚Äôt conform to their conventional beliefs and I thought, well, they‚Äôre not even being scientists. And I just left the system. I realised the message is more important for the average person than it is to argue in the halls of science\\". Lipton has received the 2009 Goi Peace Award. Reception In 2010, Katherine Ellison writing in her opinion column in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, asserted that Lipton \\"remains on the sidelines of conventional discussions of epigenetics\\", and quoted Lipton as saying he was basically ignored by mainstream science. In Science-Based Medicine, professor David Gorski has described Lipton as a \\"well-known crank\\" and likened his idea to the law of attraction, also known as \\"The Secret\\" ‚Äì \\"wanting something badly enough makes it so\\".

25 November 19396 May 2017) was a Pakistani sitarist. At his peak he was regarded as 'one of the greatest sitar players of all time'. He continued to perform until the end of his life. He moved from India to Pakistan in 1986. In 2017, Khan was awarded Pakistan's third highest civilian honour, the Sitara-i-Imtiaz. Personal life Rais Khan was born on 25 November 1939 in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, British India. He grew up in Bombay. His training began at a very young age, on a small coconut shell sitar. In 1986 he moved to Pakistan, seven years after marrying his fourth wife - a Pakistani singer named Bilqees Khanum. In 1979, the two met for the first time in a programme by the Sabri Brothers in Karachi. They have two sons together - Farhan Khan and Huzoor Hasnain Khan. Rais Khan has four sons: Sohail Khan, Cezanne Khan, Farhan Khan and Huzoor Hasnain Khan. Career Rais Khan belonged to the Mewati gharana (classical music lineage), which is connected to Indore gharana and the \\"beenkar baz gayaki ang\\" (singing style combined with rudra veena approaches) carried out by Rais Khan's father Mohammed Khan, a rudra veena player and a sitarist. \\"Belonging to the Mewati gharana which goes back to the Mughal period, it produced famous singers Haddoo, Hasso and Nathu Khan, and later singers such as Bare Ghulam Ali Khan, as well as sitarists and sarod players.\\" > \\"The famous Indian sitar player Ustad Vilayat Khan is his maternal uncle who > came to live with them when Vilayat's father died. Rais Khan denies there is > any friction between them, contrary to the rumours that exist even today. He > praises Ravi Shankar, said to be a rival too, as a brilliant musician who > has introduced the sitar to the world.\\" Despite his extensive meend work and the gandhar pancham sitar style he used, Rais Khan's alapi, gatkari and gamaki work was different in approach, pacing, and even technique, from the Etawah style. Amongst the khayal and dhrupad doyens, Rais Khan's gharana had the classical music lineage containing the masters Haddu Khan, Hassu Khan, Nathan Khan, Bande Ali Khan, Babu Khan, Wazir Khan, Waheed Khan, Murad Khan, Latif Khan, Majid Khan, Nazeer Khan, Amanat Khan and Rajab Ali Khan of Dewas.Amit Adiecha ‚Äì \\"History of Sitar,\\" and the CD \\"Melodious Sitar of Rais Khan\\" ‚Äì Chhanda Dhara 1993 As Rais Khan's mother was a singer and his father was a beenkar (veena player), a unique combination of khyal (the most popular classical vocal style), dhrupad (the older and more orthodox classical form) and thumri (lyrical semi-classical form) ‚Äì 'angs' (approaches) developed in his playing. He gave his first public concert at Sunderbai Hall in the presence of the then Governor of Bombay Sir Maharaja Singh.Rais Khan profile Retrieved 31 December 2018 In 1955, Khan was chosen to represent India in the International Youth Festival in Warsaw, where 111 countries took part in the string instrument conference. He has also performed at the Kennedy Center. While in India, he played film music for Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhosle. In India, he played a key role by his association with film composers like Madan Mohan which resulted in many super-hit songs. He had toured extensively throughout the world. He was also a vocalist and was the first sitar player to record the super-hit song 'Ghungroo toot gaye' for BBC London in 1978 as an instrumental song with the sitar. This song was originally written by Qateel Shifai, music by Nisar Bazmi for a Pakistani film Naz (1969). Like his uncle Vilayat Khan, he often sang and demonstrated compositions on the sitar. Rais and Bismillah Khan (shehnai player) used to collaborate and perform together in live concerts as a duo, like the one at India Gate in New Delhi on 23 November 2001. For sometime, Rais Khan stopped performing, but returned in the 1980s and was invited by Ali Akbar Khan to perform in California. Rais Khan sometimes performed with his son Farhan, as he did in a 2009 performance for Pakistan Television (PTV) produced TV show 'Virsa- Heritage Revived', accompanied by Tari Khan on tabla. In 2012, he performed at the Nehru Centre in Mumbai. In 2014, he performed Hans Dhuni in Coke Studio Pakistan (season 7). Death and legacy After a prolonged illness, Rais Khan died on 6 May 2017 in Karachi at the age of 77. In 2012, one major Pakistani English-language newspaper commented about his declining health, \\"He proudly says that his decades old habit of smoking 115 cigarettes a day, which is the reason for his declining health, came to an abrupt end four years ago when the doctor ordered him to stop.\\" On his death, Urdu writer Anwar Maqsood remarked that ‚ÄúGod had given him a rare gift.

Detail from Trajan's Column, Rome The equites singulares Augusti (lit: \\"personal cavalry of the emperor\\" i.e. imperial horseguards) were the cavalry arm of the Praetorian Guard during the Principate period of imperial Rome. Based in Rome, they escorted the Roman emperor whenever he left the City on a campaign or on tours of the provinces.Goldsworthy (2003) 58 The Equites Singulares Augusti were a highly trained unit dedicated to protecting the emperor. Men who served in the Equites Singulares Augusti held a Roman public status as an \\"Equites\\". Unit History The unit's origin is uncertain but it appears that they existed during the reign of Trajan 98-117 AD. The unit is documented on Trajan's Column as active in the Dacian Wars (101-AD).Rankov (1994) 13 It has been suggested that they were formed of Trajan's personal horseguards during his governorship of Germania Superior. Although designated in inscriptions as a numerus, it appears to have been structured as a regular milliary (i.e. double-strength) ala of the Auxilia, under the command of a tribunus militum, who probably reported to the Praefectus Praetorio, the commandant of the Guard.Rankov (1994) 13 Initially, it probably contained 720 horsemen, divided into 24 turmae, or squadrons, of 30 men each. Numbers rose to around 1,000 under Hadrian (r. 117-38) and the regiment was expanded to some 2,000 horse in the early 3rd century by the emperor Septimius Severus (ruled AD 197-211).Tomlin (1988) 107 Their home-base was in Rome, and their permanent camp was on the Caelian Hill. A second, supplementary, camp was built, also on the Caelian, when the unit was expanded under Septimius Severus; this has been excavated underneath the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome (see Castra Nova equitum singularium). The equites singulares were recruited from serving cavalrymen in the alae of the Auxilia, selected for their quality. As membership of the Praetorian Guard was strictly limited to persons holding Roman citizenship, it appears that recruits to the imperial horseguards were granted citizenship on enlistment, instead of having to serve 25 years to qualify for citizenship as did their fellow alares.Rankov (1994) 14 The equipment of the equites singulares was the same as for ordinary auxiliary cavalrymen. From the Great Trajanic Frieze incorporated in the Arch of Constantine in Rome, it appears that the emblem of the equites singulares was the scorpion, which was emblazoned on their standards and (fourfold) on their shields. The scorpion was the birth-sign of the emperor Tiberius, and presumably represented Tiberius' role as 'second founder' of the Praetorian Guard.Rankov (1994) 6, 53 and Plate H It appears that after some campaigns, detachments of singulares were left behind in the provinces, to form the core of new regular alae, which retained the prestigious singulares title and crack reputation e.g. the Ala I Flavia singularium stationed in Raetia in mid-2nd century.Holder (2003) In AD 312, after the defeat of the emperor Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian bridge, the regiment was disbanded, along with the rest of the Praetorian Guard, by the emperor Constantine I (ruled 312-37).Jones (1964) 100 The unit may already have become redundant, if the scholae, elite cavalry regiments escorting the emperor, had already been established by the emperor Diocletian (ruled 284-305). Alternatively, the scholae may have been founded by Constantine as a direct replacement for the equites singulares.Jones (1964) 613  Citations   References   External links  See also  * Castra Nova equitum singularium * Praetorian Guard * Auxiliaries (Roman military) Military units and formations of the Roman Empire Praetorian Guard Cavalry units and formations of ancient Rome ","title":"Equites singulares Augusti"},{"id":"25088366","text":"Alexander Campbell (1876 - May 16, 1940) was a physician, fox rancher and political figure in Newfoundland.

Campbell was named to the Executive Council as Minister of Agriculture and Mines and became a member of the Legislative Council of Newfoundland in 1920. He was accused of misspending government funds and a later investigation found that there was some truth to these accusations. When Richard Squires refused to remove Campbell from cabinet in 1923, Squires was forced to resign as Prime Minister.

The piece was donated to IUPUI and is located outside of the west entrance to Eskenazi Hall on the IUPUI campus. Eskenazi Hall houses Indiana University‚Äôs Herron School of Art and Design and is located at 735 W. New York Street in Indianapolis. The sculpture was created in 2005. Torso Fragment is 20\\" long by 17\\" wide by 37\\" high. The metal work of public art stands atop a concrete base, with a label identifying the artist, title and year of creation on the proper front (south side) of the base. Description alt=This image is an excellent educational example of the S Curve art form in modern and classical sculpture. \\"The torso piece, commissioned by his alma mater, the Herron School of Art and Design in Indianapolis, resembles a piece from classical antiquity, except that instead of being carved in stone, it's formed from aluminum.\\" Eskridge's creation of Torso Fragment was clearly influenced by the classical sculpture developed during the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece and the exaggerated contrapposto form. This silver sculpture of a male torso twists in a classical S Curve form, with the proper right thigh extending forward and its counterpart ‚Äî the proper left thigh ‚Äî in a flexed, straight position. The S Curve continues with a slight twist in the torso and finishes with the proper right shoulder raised while proper left shoulder slacked and extended downward. The sculpture has been described as \\"a truncated male figure that shows a muscular torso slightly turned - might have been lifted from an archaeological ruin.\\" Departing from this reference to classical sculpture, Torso Fragment is hollow and aluminum, reminding a viewer of its modern origins. Information  Torso Fragment is one of three sculptures by Eskridge on the campus of IUPUI. The other two works are a commissioned fictional bust of the patron saint of nurses, St. Camillus de Lellis, installed in the School of Nursing, and a bust of Dr. Joseph T. Taylor, the first dean of the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. Torso Fragment was created in 2005 for the First Sculpture Invitational. It is located outdoors, just west of Eskenazi Hall.  Acquisition  Torso Fragment is part of a collection of outdoor sculptures displayed and located on the IUPUI campus. This sculpture was added to the collection in 2005. It was selected for the first Public Sculpture Invitational exhibition hosted by the Herron School of Art and Design, which provided a showcase for the work of ‚Äú15 artists each represented by a single work.‚Äù The exhibit included fifteen public works of art on view outdoors from May 2005 to August 2006. Featured artists included Herron School of Art and Design faculty Katrin Asbury, Greg Hull, and Eric Nordgulen. Other artists included David Bellamy, Barbara Cooper, Tom Otterness, John Ruppert, James Wille Faust, Edward Mayer, Don Gummer, Judith Shea, Casey Eskridge, Wim Delvoye, Tom Sachs, and Arney Nadler. Funds from the Cultural Development Commission, Ruth Lilly, IU New Frontiers Grant Program, and the IUPUI Campus Arts Committee supported the exhibition.  Artist  Casey Eskridge grew up in rural Indiana, the son of a farmer. He spent his time ‚Äúplaying sports and being outdoors‚Äù. Eskridge is best known for a ‚Äúnaturalistic approach to the figure, recognizing human imperfections and the character within the figure\\". Eskridge, who earned his bachelor's degree from the Herron School of Art and Design in 1997 received his Master of Fine Arts degree in 2002 from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Born in Geelong, Victoria in 1881, he spent most of his life in the United Kingdom. He was educated briefly at Ellesmere College, Shropshire during 1894 but left in October on account of ill health (he suffered chronic asthma and bronchitis). His work focussed on railway engineering and he was managing director of the Kearney Railway Construction Company Ltd. The Kearney High-Speed Tube Sketches published in 1915 of Kearney's underground monorail system Tube line across London Kearney patented an innovative underground monorail railway system, the Kearney High-Speed Tube, which used the effects of gravity to enhance acceleration and deceleration and reduce power consumption with a \\"roller coaster\\" type of motion; from shallow sub-surface stations, deep-level tube tunnels would fall away at a 1-in-7 gradient, enabling underground trains to reach an estimated before slowing down as they climbed to the next station. The trains were unusual in that they would run on a single rail with four double-flanged wheels under each carriage; wheels mounted on the roof would run along an upper guide rail above the train. This upper guide rail, along with the carriages' low centre of gravity and the gyroscopic effect of motion, would stabilise the train on the lower rail and reduce the side-to-side hunting oscillation, thus preventing derailments and allowing greater speeds. At least two models of the system were built, in 1905 and 1908, including dramatic extremes such as 1-in-3 gradients and S-bends. Demonstration lines were planned at the 1911 Festival of Empire at Crystal Palace, in 1914 at the Aldwych in London, and a 1920 proposal between two hills in Brighton and Rottingdean. A full-sized carriage body was constructed by Brush Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd at Lougborough, which was apparently later destroyed by fire in suspicious circumstances. Kearney founded the Kearney High-Speed Tube Railway Company Ltd, a venture which promoted the construction of a Kearney Tube system across London from Cricklewood and Strand to Crystal Palace. Although his proposals won support from the City of London Tradesmen's Club, they failed to win any parliamentary attention. Kearney's London scheme made no progress, but he continued to promote ‚Äî unsuccessfully ‚Äî the Kearney High- Speed Tube system in other schemes around the world, including New York City, Boston, Toronto, a line between Venice and Venice Lido, and another between Nice and Monte Carlo. A 1919 scheme linking North Woolwich and Beresford Square, Woolwich, under the River Thames also failed. In 1922 he proposed an ambitious solution to the problem of crossing Sydney Harbour by rail with a Kearney Tube. In 1923, Kearney produced a proposal for a line linking Howard Street, North Shields and Palatine Street, South Shields under the River Tyne, which achieved strong public support. Kearney applied for a Light Railway Order in November 1925, and the Minister for Transport granted a Provisional Order for the line, but the Conformation Bill was rejected at the Committee stage on opposition from Tynemouth Corporation. A later proposal by Kearney for a line linking the railway stations of each town in 1939, promoted in conjunction with the London & North Eastern Railway, failed due to the onset of World War II. Before and during the War, Kearney lobbied for underground lines in several British cities, including Leeds (where plans advanced as far as discussions with the Council), that were designed with longitudinal benches and the bottom rail flush with the floor, so that the tunnels could be used as air-raid shelters. Issues included that the design of the system, with stations close to the surface, presented a risk to shelterers in an air-raid, and the general lack of funds in wartime Britain. The Kearney High-Speed Tube was an untried and untested technology, and no-one was prepared to run the risk of adopting his system. None of his schemes ever made it past the drawing board and the Kearney Tube idea faded away. Writing Kearney was an active promoter of monorail technology, publishing leaflets and giving lectures on the subject, and wrote a book, Rapid Transit in the Future: the Kearney High- Speed Railway (1911). He later wrote a utopian science fiction novel, Erone (1943), which attempted to popularise the idea of monorail transport.

He had made his money from devising a refrigeration plant that could be used to transport food in ships worldwide. At one time he owned and lived at Breadsall Priory in Derbyshire. His son Eric Seale Haslam was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1937. Life Haslam at the Palace of Westminster in 1901 by John Benjamin Stone Alfred Seale Haslam was the fourth son of William Haslam, an iron-founder. He trained as an engineer and took over the Union Foundry in 1868 in partnership with his father, running it by himself from 6 February 1873 after his father retired from the partnership. It became the Haslam Foundry and Engineering Company Ltd in 1876. Haslam started his civic life in 1879 when he was elected a councillor for Derby and some years later a Justice of the Peace. During the year that he was Mayor of Derby he managed to replace the old William Strutt Infirmary with the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. In 1890 there had been an outbreak of disease at the old infirmary and Sir William Evans, President of the Infirmary arranged a three- day inspection which condemned the old building. When Queen Victoria came to lay the foundation stone for the new hospital on 21 May 1891 she knighted Haslam for his services and gave permission for the term \\"Royal\\" to be used. Haslam's 1894 patent application shows the novel compressor In 1894 Haslam had made a patent application for a new type of compressor for Ammonia. Using this compressor, the gas was compressed in stages without much leakage, enabling refrigerated transportation of food in ships. He started transporting meat from the British Antipodean colonies and for the next fourteen years, \\"held a virtual monopoly of British marine meat refrigeration\\". The portrait shown here is by John Benjamin Stone who started the National Photographic Record Association. Haslam was a member of this association and his son Victor was also an active member. In 1896 he funded a statue of Queen Victoria by Charles Bell Birch at the north end of Blackfriars Bridge in London. Haslam made a similar donation to create a statue in his constituency of Newcastle under Lyme in 1903. Haslam had a third erected in Derby.

Haslam was Master of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers & Coach Harness Makers in London in 1904. On 27 March 1917, Haslam's 24-year-old son Captain William Kenneth Seale Haslam was killed in action in France while serving with 4th (North Midland) Brigade, Territorial Force, Royal Field Artillery. He was buried in the Tilloy British Cemetery, Tilloy-l√®s- Mofflaines, Pas de Calais. His son Captain Eric Seale Haslam was an officer in the same artillery unit from 1913, but survived the war, and was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1937. Death and legacy Halsma died at the Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London, aged 82. Haslam was buried in Morley in Derbyshire and he left over one million pounds in his will. Haslam's has a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery in London. The archaeologically interesting St Mary's Bridge Chapel in Derby was renovated using funds from the Haslam family in his memory. Breadsall Priory was in Haslam ownership until 1967 when it was sold by the executors of Haslam's only surviving son Eric. Eric had continued the business as the Derby Pure Ice and Cold Storage Company.

Yuri Alexeyevich Trutnev (Russian: –ÆÃÅ—Ä–∏–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µÃÅ–µ–≤–∏—á –¢—Ä—ÉÃÅ—Ç–Ω–µ–≤) (born 2 November 1927, Moscow) is a Russian theoretical physicist, nuclear engineer and Emeritus Professor of the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute). He worked on the RDS-37 (the Soviet Union's first two-stage thermonuclear device), the RDS-220 (the largest-ever-yield nuclear device) and many other nuclear charges. Career He graduated from the Physics department of the Leningrad State University. In 1951, he was sent to Arzamas-16 (also known as KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11', now the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF)) in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. He was one of the main authors of the final report concerning the configuration and feasibility calculations of the RDS-37, which was detonated successfully a few months later in November 1955. For this work, he was awarded the Order of Lenin, the first of several national awards. He then worked on 'Project 49', with Yuri Babayev, which involved technical improvements in the implosion of the two-stage charges, which were tested successfully in 1958 and put into production. Andrei Sakharov selected the design team to develop the RDS-220 which included himself, Trutnev, Viktor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev and (Adamsky and Vyacheslav Feodoritov were the project leads). The second and third stages of the RDS-220 were designed principally by Trutnev and Babayev. In 1964, he was appointed head of his department and deputy head of the sector. He was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) the same year. The following year he became head of the sector and in 1966 deputy supervisor. In 1978, he became first deputy supervisor and head of the theoretical department. He became an Academician of the RAS in 1991. From 1993 to 1999, he was first deputy supervisor of VNIIEF. Trutnev began development of nuclear devices for industrial civilian purposes such as reservoir creation and gas field intensification, and devices which released very low amounts of ionising radiation. Yevgeny Avrorin described Trutnev producing the first \\"clean\\" nuclear charge, \\"a purely thermonuclear reaction\\" from a solid compound. Employees at Arzamas-16, including Trutnev, were upset that on a visit by Edward Teller and Siegfried S. Hecker (then director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory) to Russia after the break-up of the U.S.S.R., each was photographed in front of a model of the RDS-220 alongside scientists in Snezhinsk. Trutnev insisted that a new photograph be taken of Hecker at VNIIEF in front of a similar model, as it was he and his colleagues at VNIIEF in Sarov who designed the device. Trutnev is the editor-in-chief of the Atomic Science and Technology journal and deputy editor-in-chief of the International Scientific Journal for Alternative Energy and Ecology.

His eldest brother, Dr John Burns FRS, became the first professor of surgery in the University of Glasgow, and his second brother, Allan Burns, became physician to the empress of Russia at St Petersburg. Burns was married twice: first, to Margaret Smith and, second, to Margaret Shortridge, who predeceased him. With Margaret Shortridge he had one son, John Burns, who inherited his estates and became chairman of the Cunard Line. Shipping Unlike his older brothers, James Burns turned to commerce, and was joined by his younger brother, Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet (1795‚Äì1890), in 1818, setting up as J. & G. Burns, general merchants in Glasgow. After six years, the two brothers moved into shipping, joining with Hugh Mathie of Liverpool to establish a small shipping line of six sailing vessels plying between the two ports. The Clyde was then the leading waterway for steam navigation; within a year James and George Burns had ordered their first steamer, and they quickly replaced all their sail ships by steamboats. While George was mainly interested in the technical aspects of the ships, it was James who was the chief commercial influence in the business, supervising the day-to-day transactions, the negotiation of cargoes and contracts. The Mathie connection with Liverpool was replaced in 1830 by a new arrangement with two Liverpool- based Scots, David and Charles MacIver, to form the Glasgow Steam Packet Company. This arrangement allowed James and George Burns to extend their steamship business to Londonderry, Larne, and Belfast. As before, George concentrated on the shipping department, while James was mainly responsible for the mercantile side of the business. While the Irish Sea trade was their first and main business, two other avenues opened up to James and George Burns. In 1839 the Liverpool connection was greatly strengthened when George Burns was introduced to Samuel Cunard and raised ¬£270,000 in subscriptions to establish the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. This company secured a seven-year contract from the Admiralty to carry the American mails by steamship. James and George, with the MacIvers, were founding partners and shareholders with Cunard in the new venture. While this took George's attention south to Liverpool, James concentrated on the Glasgow business, and in 1845 G. and J. Burns acquired an interest in the developing west highland steamer services by purchasing the Castle Line. This however was quickly re-sold to their nephew David Macbrayne, their shipping clerk David Hutcheson, and his brother Alexander. He retired from active business and developed an interest in estate improvement, acquiring the estates of Kilmahew, Cumbernauld, and Bloomhall in Dunbartonshire. He spent much time on improvements and was a liberal supporter of religious and philanthropic enterprises. He died on 6 September 1871 at Kilmahew Castle, Cardross, Dumbarton, and was succeeded in his estates by his only son, John Burns. References The Old Country Houses of the Old Glasgow Gentry.

The Evolution of Public Broadcasting in Jamaica\\" - Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, May 21, 2008 The JBC was established by legislation in December 1958 as a 'state owned and statutory corporation' and launched on 15 June 1959 and provided a greater focus on Jamaican culture, as Jamaicans sought to celebrate their own culture in the 'dominion' era shortly before the country's independence in 1962. In the early days of the JBC, the corporation had a resident big band featuring musicians such as Ernest Ranglin and Sonny Bradshaw and a drama department producing original programmes. The JBC radio channel that began broadcasting in 1959 played a major part in the development of the Jamaican music industry, giving previously-unavailable airtime to Jamaican musicians. JBC Television began broadcasting on Sunday, 4 August 1963 at 6 pm ( See: The Daily Gleaner Archives, August 4, 1963 page 2), to coincide with the first anniversary of Jamaica's independence. Like the radio station, the aim was to concentrate on Jamaican programming, but financial concerns saw the schedules increasingly filled with programmes imported from the US and the UK. The links to the government, however, caused problems, with accusations of partisan journalism. A change in government in 1962 led to accusations of JBC journalists favouring the previous PNP government, a situation that led to one of the longest strikes in Jamaican history in 1964. By the end of the strike most of the news journalists had been replaced. When Michael Manley (son of Norman Manley) was elected Prime Minister in 1972, he aimed to use the JBC as a vehicle for nation building. Government funding for original Jamaican programming was increased, with news and documentary programmes such as Public Eye, and Jamaica's first soap opera, Lime Tree Lane. By the 1980s, JBC had television, two national radio stations, and several regional radio stations. Under Prime Minister Edward Seaga and the US-led Structural Adjustment model which encouraged the privatisation of public services, the divestment of the JBC began, first with the selling off of the regional radio stations; These became Radio Waves (HOT 102), KLAS-FM and IRIE-FM. The entire newsroom staff were also dismissed for being too critical of conservative positions, and replaced with journalists considered sympathetic to Seaga's government. Foreign programming again began to proliferate, largely sourced from the US. The corporation remained under government control until the 1990s when a re- elected Manley removed direct political control and initiated shared responsibility for the appointment of a Director General with the leader of the opposition. With the JBC suffering financial problems, the inclusion of advertising was considered, as was funding it via subscription cable TV, but both were rejected. In 1997 Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, under the Public Broadcasting Corporation of Jamaica Act divested the JBC, with an announcement of the creation of a new organization, the Public Broadcasting Corporation of Jamaica (PBCJ) to provide public broadcasting.\\"The Public Broadcasting Corporation of Jamaica Act, 1997\\", Jamaican Government The television and the Radio 2 assets were sold to the Radio Jamaica Limited (RJR) for J$70M, and the former JBC television channel was replaced by the commercial station Television Jamaica.\\"History of Radio Jamaica Limited \\" The Radio 1 studios and licence were retained by the government but fell into disrepair.

It was there Dwyer reportedly met Tibor R√©v√©sz and El≈ëd T√≥√°s√≥. Bolivia In November 2008 he travelled to Bolivia from Madrid with three former I-RMS employees. According to La Prensa, the people who travelled with Dwyer on 17 November 2008 were Tibor R√©v√©sz, G√°bor Dudog and Ivan Pistovcak.According to information provided by AeroSur, the suspected mercenaries Dwyer, R√©v√©sz, Dudog and Pistovcak came to Santa Cruz on 17 November last year from Madrid (Spanish: De acuerdo con el informe remitido por AeroSur, los presuntos mercenarios Dwyer, R√©v√©sz, Dudog y Pistovc√°k llegaron a Santa Cruz el 17 de noviembre del a√±o pasado, procedentes de Madrid, Espa√±a) In Santa Cruz he joined Eduardo R√≥zsa-Flores. The media has speculated that the link between Dwyer and R√≥zsa-Flores was former I-RMS employee Tibor R√©v√©sz. Revesz is a founding member of the Szekler Legion, a paramilitary group that wants autonomy for Hungarians in Romania. An unsigned posting on the Szekler Legion website in October 2008 called for people to send their CVs to a stated email address if they believed they could assist an unnamed man ‚Äì now believed to be Flores ‚Äì in the protection of his ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù, Santa Cruz. According to family and friends, Dwyer had traveled to Bolivia to attend a bodyguard course but no evidence for such a course exists. Death in Bolivia Following a bombing on 15 April at the home of Julio Cardinal Terrazas, the following day at around 4:00 a.m. thirty members of an elite police squad entered the hotel, cut the phone line, and demanded that night staff tell them where Flores and his entourage were staying. They were the only guests on the fourth floor, in a row of five rooms. Staff members on duty reported an explosion that shook the building, followed by 10 to 15 minutes of intense gunfire, ‚Äúa rain of bullets‚Äù in the words of the night manager. Dwyer was killed, along with √Årp√°d Magyarosi and R√≥zsa-Flores. The two members of the group not killed, Mario Tadic and El≈ëd T√≥√°s√≥, were taken prisoner, however their trial was troubled by the resignation of the prosecutor in charge, upon the emergence of evidence linking him to the planting of false evidence. According to a police report he had two guns and several rounds of ammunition in his room and gunpowder residue on his hands, however this conflicted with another police report that there had been no crossfire. Ballistics reports show that two shots were fired from his room. Autopsies An Irish state pathologist, Marie Cassidy, told the inquest into his death that Dwyer died from a single shot to the heart and not from six shots to the chest as asserted by the Bolivian autopsy. She said the post mortem on Dwyer in Bolivia was incomplete. The Bolivian autopsy by Antonio Torres Bulanza and Rafael Vargas Pe√±a, of the Instituto de Investigaciones Forenses, showed Dwyer had six bullet entrance wounds with three exit wounds and the trajectory was from the back to the front, slightly from below to above, that his heart was intact and the cause of death was hypovolaemic shock (acute blood loss) from multiple thoracic injuries by bullets. Inquiry demand by Dwyer's family The Dwyer family and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs have demanded an independent international inquiry. They base their demand on photos they received showing Dwyer at an airport after he was supposed to have been killed, the claims of the former chief prosecutor who claims that Dwyer was unarmed when killed, that there was no evidence of a firefight, and that there was no evidence that Dwyer was knowingly involved in any assassination plot, and the claims of Elod Toaso that Dwyer survived the raid and that he was likely summarily executed at Viru Viru Airport. Trial of survivors In August 2013, Toaso and Tadic went on trial on charges of terrorism, along with 37 other suspects. During the trial, both testified that Dwyer was still alive after the raid had ended. Toaso testified that after the raid he was taken to Viru Viru airport, where he recognised Mr Dwyer from a tattoo on his arm and that he was wearing red boxer shorts. Tadic testified that he had heard somebody speaking in English, and that Dwyer was the only member of the group who spoke English.

After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, he was also a politician and mayor of Plovdiv. Danov was born in Klisura, a town in Ottoman Rumelia (today in central Bulgaria), to the family of a frieze waver. He commenced his education at the Klisura religious school before moving to the class school in Panagyurishte opened by Sava Radulov, where he studied in 1841‚Äì1842. However, his father's death meant Danov had to return to Klisura and become a craftsman so as to sustain the family. In 1847, he again enrolled at the Panagyurishte school, and in 1848‚Äì1850 he was a student at Nayden Gerov's school in Koprivshtitsa. Having completed his education, Hristo Danov became a teacher in Strelcha (1851‚Äì1852) and Perushtitsa (1852‚Äì1853). During the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) he was a teacher in Plovdiv. In 1856, Danov returned to Klisura, where he established the town's first modern class school. Danov's work as a publisher began in Belgrade, the capital of the Principality of Serbia, where he printed the calendar Balkan Mountain Boy. Calendar for the 1856 Leap Year. Together with the teacher Yacho (Yoakim) Truvchev and the bookbinder Nyagul Boyadzhiyski, he founded the bindery Druzhestvena knigoveznitsa (–î—Ä—É–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–æ–≤–µ–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∞) in 1857 in Plovdiv. The bindery would gradually grow to become a bookshop and then emerge as the first Bulgarian publishing house. By 1862, the company had evolved into the Hristo G. Danov & Co. Publishing House, and Yoakim Gruev had joined as a partner. In 1862, the Hristo G. Danov & Co. Publishing House had branches in Ruse and Veles. In 1874, Danov's publishing house opened its own printing office in Vienna, the Austro‚ÄìHungarian capital. As a publisher, Danov contributed greatly to the development of Bulgarian education in the Bulgarian National Revival period. His publishing house issued Neofit Rilski's mutual instruction graphs, textbooks and geographic maps for the school curriculum, as well as the first Bulgarian large-scale wall maps. Other books published by Danov included individual works by Euripides, Ivan Turgenev, Guy de Maupassant and Jules Verne. In 1876, in the wake of the major anti-Ottoman April Uprising organized by the Bulgarian population, Danov was imprisoned for three months in Plovdiv. Once released, he moved to Svishtov, where he was based for the most of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). As the war led to Bulgaria's liberation, Danov had his printing office moved from Vienna to Plovdiv (which in 1878 became the capital of autonomous Eastern Rumelia, which united with the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885). From 1878 to 1885 he issued the Maritsa newspaper, the first all-Bulgarian newspaper, which was supported by vice- governor Todor Burmov and the interim Russian government. In 1880, the publishing house expanded with branches in Lom and Sofia. Danov himself became an associate member of the Bulgarian Literary Society (today the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences) in 1881, and an honorary member in 1900. Memorial plaque dedicated to Hristo G. Danov in Plovdiv Danov began his political career as a member of the Eastern Rumelia Regional Assembly in 1882. Between 1 February 1897 and 2 July 1899, he was mayor of Plovdiv, for which he asked to receive no salary. It was during his term that the first town plan of Plovdiv was designed by Josef Schnitter. Another of Danov's accomplishments as a mayor was the afforestation of two of Plovdiv's seven hills. Danov died in 1911 and was interred at the Church of the Holy Mother of God in Plovdiv. Among Hristo G. Danov's descendants are several prominent Bulgarians, including historian Hristo M. Danov (1908‚Äì1997) and lawyer Hristo Danov (1922‚Äì2003). His daughter- in-law, Sofia Danova (1879‚Äì1946), was the first Bulgarian woman to obtain a mathematics degree. Danov's House in Plovdiv's Old Town is home to one of the Plovdiv Regional Historical Museum's expositions, dedicated to the history of Bulgarian publishing. The house dates to the mid-19th century. Danov's namesake award was established in 1999 and is presented annually by the Bulgarian Ministry of Culture and the Plovdiv National Book Center to recognize those who make contributions to Bulgarian literary culture.

Chamberlain had long been regarded as Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's political heir, and when Baldwin announced his retirement, Chamberlain was seen as the only possible successor. Chamberlain was born in 1869; his father was the politician and future Cabinet minister, Joseph Chamberlain. He was educated at Rugby School and Mason College (now Birmingham University); at neither institution was he particularly successful. After a period in a firm of chartered accountants, the younger Chamberlain spent six years in the Bahamas managing a sisal plantation in a failed attempt to recoup the family fortunes. After returning to England in 1897, Chamberlain became a successful businessman in his home city of Birmingham. He was interested in social affairs, and successfully stood for Birmingham City Council in 1911. He became Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1915. His second term was interrupted in December 1916 when Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked him to become Director of National Service. Chamberlain received little support from Lloyd George in the post, and his eight-month tenure sparked a hatred between the two which lasted Chamberlain's lifetime. In 1918, Chamberlain was elected to the House of Commons, at age 49 the oldest man to enter Parliament and later become Prime Minister. After four years on the backbenches, Chamberlain saw rapid promotion, briefly becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer after less than a year as a minister. Chamberlain subsequently spent five years as Minister of Health, securing the passage of many reforming acts. After two years in opposition, Chamberlain became part of Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, and spent five and a half years as Chancellor, directing Britain's financial policies as the nation emerged from the Depression. When Baldwin (who had replaced MacDonald as Prime Minister in 1935) retired in 1937, Chamberlain succeeded him.  Early life  Joseph Chamberlain, father of Neville Mason College, now the University of Birmingham Chamberlain was born in a house called Southbourne, in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham, England, as the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham, and who also served as a Cabinet minister. Joseph Chamberlain had fathered two children by his first marriage, Beatrice and Austen. Joseph's first wife, Harriet, died giving birth to Austen; Neville's mother, the former Florence Kenrick, also died in childbirth in 1875, when Neville was six years old. Florence Chamberlain left three daughters in addition to Neville and her stepchildren. Joseph Chamberlain, in the midst of a highly successful parliamentary career, was often away, leaving the household in the hands of his sister. Young Neville was sent away to school at age eight. Chamberlain attended Rugby School. Unhappy during his school years, he made no lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but had little interest in the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.  Businessman (1890‚Äì1911)  Austen Chamberlain, Neville's half- brother Joseph Chamberlain had difficulty living within his means, a problem exacerbated by investment losses in the late 1880s. In 1890, Sir Ambrose Shea, Governor of the Bahamas, advised him that growing sisal in the Bahamas could restore the family fortunes. Joseph Chamberlain sent his two sons to the Bahamas to investigate in November 1890, and they recommended the venture. Neville Chamberlain was assigned to manage the undertaking, and in early 1891, the 22-year-old took out a lease on on the island of Andros. He spent most of the next six years on Andros. The soil proved to be unsuitable for growing sisal, and the venture failed. Joseph Chamberlain lost ¬£50,000 (approximately ¬£4.2 million today). Neville Chamberlain returned to Britain in early 1897. Neville Chamberlain resided in his father's Birmingham house, Highbury, a large part of which was shut up to save on expenses. His father and half- brother spent much of their time in London, where they were serving in the Lord Salisbury Government. Through a family connection, Neville Chamberlain was made a director of Elliot's Metal Company, which was located within a mile (1.6 km) of Highbury. Chamberlain took a hands-on approach, exploring all aspects of the business. In November 1897, he purchased (with assistance from his family) Hoskins & Company, a manufacturer of metal ship berths. Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17 years, during which time the company prospered. Chamberlain introduced a profit-sharing scheme at Hoskins which he credited with ensuring industrial peace, and opened a medical clinic for the workers. His business acumen raised him in the eyes of his father, who told a friend that of his two sons, \\"Neville is really the clever one\\" and but for his lack of interest in politics, \\"I would back him to be Prime Minister\\". Chamberlain's business interests did not completely fill his time, and he indulged his love of natural history and other outdoor pursuits. He spent many Sundays working in the gardens and greenhouses at Highbury. He enjoyed long walks in the countryside, and developed a passion for hunting and fishing. Even as he approached the heights of his political career, he would contribute articles to journals such as The Countryman. In 1931, he stated, \\"I really can't consent to die until they arrange some fishing in the next world.\\" Chamberlain travelled extensively in Europe and North Africa, made a five-month tour to India, Ceylon and Burma in 1904‚Äì05, and according to his biographer, Robert Self, was one of the more travelled Prime Ministers. Chamberlain also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham. In 1906, Chamberlain was a founding member of the University House Committee at Birmingham University, the president of which was his aunt, Mrs Charles Beale, wife of the University's first Vice-Chancellor. He became an Official Visitor and then a director of the Birmingham General Hospital. He advocated a larger facility for the hospital, a cause in which he was eventually successful, though building did not commence until 1934 and he was still fundraising as Prime Minister. Stating that he was painfully aware of the defects of his own education, he played a part in the establishment of the University of Birmingham, of which Mason Science College became a part. Joseph Chamberlain became the University's first chancellor; Neville Chamberlain was appointed to its Council and later to its Board of Governors. Though he declared himself uninterested in politics, Chamberlain supported his father's views loyally. He made speeches in support of British policy towards the Boers and when the Boer War broke out, supported the British war effort. During the \\"Khaki election\\" of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists, which were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them. In 1903, Chamberlain fell in love with Rosalind Sellor, a London professional singer, and repeatedly journeyed to the capital to be with her. The following year, she decided she preferred another man, leaving Chamberlain distraught. In 1910, he fell in love with Anne Cole, a distant relative by marriage, and the following year married her. Anne Chamberlain proved to be a loyal supporter of her husband and got along well with his maiden sisters. The two had a son and a daughter, with Neville Chamberlain involving himself deeply in the children's upbringing. When he became Prime Minister in 1937 Chamberlain paid tribute to his wife:  Early political career (1911‚Äì1922)   Birmingham politician  Birmingham Council House, Victoria Square, Birmingham While Chamberlain had continued to give speeches at general elections, his entry into politics at age 42 in 1911 stemmed from interest in local politics and the opportunities they offered for social improvement. In 1910, Chamberlain appeared before a Parliamentary committee, testifying in favour of a bill to merge Birmingham with its suburbs. The bill passed, tripling the size of the city and greatly increasing its population. Chamberlain was very interested in city planning for Birmingham. In November 1911, standing as a Liberal Unionist, he was elected to Birmingham City Council for All Saints' Ward, located within his father's parliamentary constituency. Chamberlain's party merged with the Conservatives the following year, forming the Unionist Party, which was given its present formal name of the Conservative and Unionist Party in 1925. Upon his election, Chamberlain was made chairman of the Town Planning Committee, which sketched out four development schemes covering in the city, allowing for suburban development while preserving green space. In 1913, he led a committee looking at housing conditions in Birmingham. It was a forerunner to the parliamentary Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919‚Äì21), of which he was chairman. Chamberlain found that over 100,000 housing units lacked toilet facilities, with nearly half of those not even having running water. He advocated gradual reorganisation to abate the problem, and warned that the city government must be ready to take over property if the private sector failed. Under Chamberlain's direction, Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain which would, in time, be mirrored by other large industrial cities such as Liverpool and Leeds. However, the start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans in Birmingham. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Chamberlain became deeply involved in the war effort. In addition to his duties as councillor, Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers. Late in 1914, he became an alderman of Birmingham, and the following year, became Lord Mayor. Chamberlain's biographer, Robert Self, suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year, the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain's hard work rather than to any family influence. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work, and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He set up cr√®ches for workers, stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage, and reinvigorated Birmingham's various committees, which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries. He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription, and stated that he was more lenient than were other members of the tribunal. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance, and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent. Under Chamberlain, the group which became the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was initiated. The Lord Mayor persuaded Sir Thomas Beecham to conduct a series of events in Birmingham. The concerts caused Birmingham to be regarded as a cultural centre, and in 1919, the Orchestra was formally founded. Chamberlain established the Birmingham Municipal Bank, the only one of its type in the country, which aimed to encourage savings to pay for the war loan. The bank proved highly successful and lasted until 1976, when it was taken over by Lloyds Bank. Chamberlain was re-elected Lord Mayor in 1916, but he did not complete his term.  Director of National Service  David Lloyd George, Prime Minister 1916‚Äì1922, whose contempt for Chamberlain was reciprocated Conscription for the Army, but not for civilian industry, had been brought in during the first half of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith's Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville's brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor. To a great extent Chamberlain's actual responsibilities were left vague by Lloyd George. On his appointment Lloyd George implied in the House of Commons that \\"compulsion\\" (the industrial equivalent of conscription) was to be extended to industry and that Chamberlain would soon produce a system of industrial enrolment. But Chamberlain found his work to be handicapped by the Prime Minister's political manoeuvres. As Chamberlain sought to maximise the number of workers subject both to military conscription and compulsion into industry, Lloyd George pledged to the unions that he would oppose any sort of \\"industrial conscription\\". Although Chamberlain repeatedly made proposals for mandatory service, they were turned down by Lloyd George and his War Cabinet. The Army still controlled its own recruitment at this stage, whilst Chamberlain met with resistance from the Ministries of Munitions and Labour. Chamberlain's proposal that all men under 21 be drafted from industry into the Army was blocked by Minister of Munitions Addison (19 January 1917), as it would have meant conscripting skilled young men who had already spent time in apprenticeships. Chamberlain was not made a Privy Councillor. He also spurned advice from Lloyd George about his choice of advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead appointing cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers that he had been given a new Parliamentary Secretary. Denied the use of compulsion, Chamberlain had to persuade Britons to volunteer for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange the comforts of home and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000 workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties. Chamberlain finally resigned on 8 August 1917. He was thanked warmly by the staff at St Ermin's Hotel where the Ministry was housed. Lloyd George wrote to his family (in Welsh) that \\"Neville Chamberlain has resigned and thank God for that.\\" He met with considerable sympathy from members of parliament after his resignation. John Dillon, an Irish Nationalist MP, stated that \\"if Mr. Chamberlain were an archangel, or if he were Hindenburg and Bismarck and all the great men of the world rolled into one, his task would be wholly beyond his powers\\". Unionist Party leader Bonar Law spoke of the \\"absolutely impossible task\\" Chamberlain had faced. Auckland Geddes, Chamberlain's successor, was made a Privy Councillor and had more power and more support from the War Cabinet than he had had. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George \\"that dirty little Welsh Attorney\\" and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, the brother of one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, \\"More's the pity, for together if they were together they might do a great deal.\\" Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that \\"Mr Chamberlain is a man of rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times ‚Ä¶ and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.\\" HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain's government.  Candidate and backbencher  Having resigned as Director, Chamberlain returned to Birmingham, embittered by his experience in London. He wrote that the experience \\"reminds me of the Bahamas when the plants didn't grow\\". He had retained his seat on the City Council and busied himself with his civic duties, as well as his business interests and family life. In February 1918, having declined a third term as Lord Mayor, he was appointed Deputy Mayor. Chamberlain had formed a close friendship with his cousin, Norman Chamberlain, who had also served on the City Council and who shared the future Prime Minister's social ideals. In December 1917, Norman Chamberlain was reported missing in action during the Battle of Cambrai, and in February 1918, Norman's body was found‚Äîa great blow to Neville Chamberlain, who described Norman as \\"the most intimate friend I had\\". Through the rest of his career, Neville Chamberlain laboured to further the ideals of his cousin, and wrote his biography‚Äîthe only book he ever wrote. Some historians relate Norman's death to a hatred of war on his cousin's part which led to appeasement; according to Chamberlain's biographer Nick Smart, the death did not cause Chamberlain to hate World War I, and any influence on his later positions is far from certain. After some hesitation as to his future career, Chamberlain determined to enter Parliament, though, after his experience with National Service, he feared that he would only have a brief, unsatisfying parliamentary career. Wishing to stand for a Birmingham constituency, he initially had some difficulty in finding one. The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave Birmingham five additional seats, and Chamberlain was adopted as candidate for one of the new seats, Birmingham Ladywood. With the election on hold until the conclusion of the war, he continued his work in Birmingham. Shortly after the Armistice, his sister Beatrice died in the influenza pandemic, and Chamberlain mourned her, \\"She had the warmest heart.\\" With the war ended, a general election was called almost immediately. Chamberlain stood as a Unionist (as the Conservative Party was known from 1912 to 1925) and was given the \\"coupon\\" or letter of endorsement granted by Coalition party leaders Lloyd George and Bonar Law to approved candidates, though he declined to make any use of it. He was elected with almost 70% of the vote and a majority of 6,833. At age 49, he remains the oldest man to enter Parliament for the first time and later become Prime Minister. Chamberlain threw himself into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30 am. Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as leader of the Unionists in Parliament. Unionist backbenchers had long been restive as Lloyd George granted the Liberals in the Coalition more than their proportionate share of offices. In October 1922, discontent among Unionists against the Lloyd George Coalition Government erupted. When Unionist MPs were summoned to the Carlton Club for a meeting to receive their instructions for the forthcoming election, which, as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, they instead rebelled and voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister. Most Unionist leaders, including Austen Chamberlain, had supported the Coalition and advocated its continuation. They resigned from their government and party offices, with Austen Chamberlain writing, \\"The meeting today rejected our advice. Other men who have given other counsels must inherit our burden\\". Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister. Neville Chamberlain was in Canada at the time of the meeting and so was not forced to choose between supporting his brother's leadership and bringing down a Prime Minister he despised.  Minister (1922‚Äì1937)   Bonar Law Government; early ministerial office  Painting of Prime Minister Bonar Law Many frontbench Unionists refused to serve under Bonar Law, who was forced to form his Cabinet from lower-ranking party members. Liberal MP Winston Churchill, who would lose his seat in the upcoming election, dubbed Bonar Law's ministry \\"a government of the second eleven\\". The conflict amongst the Unionists greatly benefited Neville Chamberlain, who rose, over the course of ten months, from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer. Bonar Law appointed Chamberlain as Postmaster General, a ministerial post below Cabinet level. Bonar Law called an election shortly after his accession, which the Unionists won, and Chamberlain was re-elected, though his prediction that his seat was \\"safe as houses\\" proved dubious‚Äîhis majority was reduced to 2,443. In January 1923, Chamberlain granted the first operating licence to the British Broadcasting Company, though he opposed its request to broadcast the King's Speech setting forth the Government's programme in opening Parliament. Chamberlain feared that allowing the speech to be aired would lead to broadcast of parliamentary debates over the radio, \\"a prospect which makes one shudder\\". Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, the Minister of Health, had lost his seat in the 1922 General Election and failed to win a by-election in March 1923. Housing fell within the remit of the Minister of Health. As Chamberlain had experience in developing housing programmes in Birmingham, Bonar Law offered the Health Ministry, within the Cabinet, to him. Chamberlain was initially reluctant, feeling that he should not leave the Post Office before he \\"had a chance of doing something there\\", but decided that \\"it would not be playing the game\\" to refuse Bonar Law's request. There was a great shortage of housing in Britain as a result of pent- up demand from the war years, and almost all housing was rent controlled, giving builders little incentive to build more. Any removal of rent restrictions would be wildly unpopular. Chamberlain introduced a Housing Act in April 1923 that provided subsidies for private companies, and extended rent control until 1925. He expected rent control to be gradually abolished as the housing supply increased, but the restrictions remained in force until 1933, when a new scheme was enacted. In May 1923, Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced terminal throat cancer. He immediately resigned, and King George V sent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin, to form a government. Baldwin served as his own Chancellor for three months while he sought a successor and then promoted Chamberlain to the position. Chamberlain had little time for any policy changes, as he served only five months in the office and did not present a budget. Though the Unionists had an ample majority in the House of Commons and the current Parliament had four years to run, Baldwin decided that a general election was needed and that the Unionists should fight it on the issue of tariff reform. He hoped to gain both a personal mandate as Prime Minister and a policy mandate for his tariff proposals. He miscalculated badly: in the general election held in December 1923 the Unionists remained the largest party in the House of Commons, but were outnumbered by the combined Liberal and Labour MPs. The Baldwin Government retained office until it was defeated when Parliament assembled in January 1924, and Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister. Chamberlain's majority in Birmingham Ladywood was cut yet again, this time to 1,500 votes. With the Unionists in opposition, Chamberlain managed to broker a reconciliation between his brother (and the other Coalitionists) and the new leadership, and Austen Chamberlain resumed his place on the front benches. The Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. Neville Chamberlain was challenged by Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, who later led the British Union of Fascists. Mosley campaigned aggressively in Ladywood; and accused Chamberlain of being a \\"landlords' hireling\\". The outraged Chamberlain demanded that Mosley retract the claim \\"as a gentleman\\". Mosley, whom Baldwin described as \\"a cad and a wrong 'un\\", refused to retract the allegation. It took several recounts before Chamberlain was declared the winner by 77 votes and Mosley blamed poor weather for the result. Chamberlain had not wanted to desert Ladywood, but now deemed the seat impossible to hold and was adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston for the next election (held in 1929), at which Ladywood fell to Labour by eleven votes. The Unionists won the 1924 election, their last under that name. Baldwin formed a new government, in which Austen was Foreign Secretary and Neville Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.  Minister of Health  Within two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health, Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 had passed into law. An early, very popular piece of legislation was the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925, passed after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, had agreed to find whatever money was needed to fund the Act. Churchill, recently returned to the Conservative ranks after nineteen years as a Liberal (1904‚Äì23), expressed envy at Chamberlain's receiving the credit for the Act, and the Minister of Health described his colleague as \\"a man of tremendous drive & vivid imagination but obsessed with the glory of doing something spectacular which should erect monuments to him\\". The Act lowered the age for receiving the government old age pension from 70 to 65, as well as providing for dependents of deceased workers. Though the pension sum, ten shillings (today about ¬£20) per week, was not enough for a pensioner to make ends meet, Chamberlain stated that it was not intended to replace private thrift and that the sum was the maximum financially feasible. Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for setting rates (local property taxes). Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours‚Äîwith a pair of scissors. Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the 1926 General Strike, in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee complained that Chamberlain \\"always treated us like dirt\\", and Chamberlain wrote in April 1927, \\"More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity.\\" One Labour MP referred to Chamberlain as \\"a miniature Mussolini\\", and others claimed that Chamberlain's policies had allowed entire communities to starve, dubbing him the \\"Minister of Death\\". His poor relations with the Labour Party eventually played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister. With many mining communities suffering high levels of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.  Return to opposition  37 Eaton Square, where Chamberlain lived most of the time while in London until 1935. Baldwin called a general election for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to triumph easily, and thought he would be moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented for the rest of his life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office. Chamberlain anticipated that Labour would govern for two years, then seek another general election and be returned for a second term with an overall majority in Parliament. He believed that, were this to occur, at 67 he might well be too old to hold office again when that term expired. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman J.C.C. Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself. The campaign by the press lords, notably Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere for \\"Empire Free Trade\\", the removal of tariffs within the Empire, culminated in a crucial by-election at which the press lords ran their own candidate under the banner of the United Empire Party. Robert Topping, the General Director at Conservative Central Office, produced a memorandum showing that Baldwin's support had eroded tremendously. Chamberlain confronted Baldwin with the memorandum. Baldwin was badly shaken, and told Chamberlain he would resign. After a day, Baldwin reconsidered, and even considered giving up his seat and standing in the by-election himself. When Chamberlain told Baldwin that if he stood and lost, his successor would be badly damaged, Baldwin replied, \\"I don't give a damn about my successor, Neville.\\" Chamberlain resigned as party chairman, though he continued as head of the Conservative Research Department, which he had founded, until his death. Baldwin did not stand in the by- election, but he retained his position and attacked the press barons as wanting \\"power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot through the ages\\", and the Conservatives won the election. Baldwin and Chamberlain healed their breach, and Chamberlain helped negotiate the return of the press lords to the Conservative fold. Baldwin led the Conservative Party for another six years. In January 1931, Churchill, one of Chamberlain's leadership rivals, left the Conservative front bench in a dispute over policy on India. In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of ¬£120 million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which would be needed to balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615 seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.  Chancellor and Conservative heir apparent  After the election, MacDonald wanted to designate Liberal National Walter Runciman, an advocate of free trade, as Chancellor. Conservatives insisted that a member of their party who favoured tariffs be given the office. Reluctantly, MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor, and Runciman was made President of the Board of Trade. Chamberlain proposed a 10% tariff on foreign goods, with lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the Dominions. Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy, \\"Imperial Preference\\"; his sons found it pleasing and appropriate that Chamberlain could now promote his father's policies, and Sir Austen Chamberlain wrote to his brother in November 1931, \\"Father's great work will be completed in his children.\\" The tariff issue bitterly divided the Cabinet, and threatened to end the National Government. The Cabinet accepted a proposal by Lord Hailsham, Secretary of State for War, that they agree publicly to disagree, a rare suspension of the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility. Chamberlain prepared his tariff bill, which exempted the Dominions pending the Ottawa Conference, set for later that year. On 4 February 1932, he laid it before the Commons. Addressing a packed House, with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and Joseph Chamberlain's third wife in the gallery, and with his brother seated behind him, Chamberlain concluded by referring to his father's inability to get a similar proposal adopted, At the end of the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down and shook his brother's hand. The Import Duties Act 1932 passed Parliament easily. The Ottawa Conference that August produced little result, with Chamberlain bringing home several minor bilateral trade agreements, and no general agreement. In the interim between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain presented his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard had been abandoned in the early days of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house- building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt. Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. Describing the event as the \\"most crucial gathering since Versailles\\", Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover, referring to him as \\"that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes, lean, taciturn, iron-willed ... It is no secret that Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain's leave.\\" The Conference came to nothing, when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation. After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts, Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt, and, as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default, the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain's war debt payments to the US. In 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus, and restore many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant's salaries he had made after taking office. He told the Commons, \\"We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of Great Expectations.\\" With MacDonald in physical and mental decline and Conservative Party leader Baldwin exhibiting ever greater lethargy, Chamberlain increasingly became the workhorse of the National Government. Defence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership, he was convinced of the need for rearmament, and was the driving force behind Defence White Papers advocating rearmament in 1936 and 1937. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's traditional bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power. Rearmament was an unpopular policy in Britain, and Labour attacked Chamberlain as a warmonger. Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee spoke against the 1936 Budget as tremendously overspending on defence: \\"Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death.\\" Churchill also criticised the National Government's defence plans, though he called for an even faster buildup. Despite the sniping from both sides, Chamberlain was very concerned about the expense of rearmament, \\"What a frightful bill we do owe to Master Hitler, damn him! If it only wasn't for Germany, we should be having such a wonderful time just now.\\" In 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, taking Baldwin's post as Lord President of the Council, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time. Chamberlain remained at the Treasury, almost the only Cabinet member not to be moved in the subsequent reshuffle. Chamberlain was still spoken of as 'heir apparent', but feared being eclipsed by a younger man. To be seen more as the second man of the Government, he insisted on moving into Number 11 Downing Street, the Chancellor's traditional residence, which had been occupied by Baldwin during MacDonald's premiership. Baldwin indicated his desire to remain in office until his 70th birthday in August 1937, but Chamberlain doubted he would last that long. In the 1935 General Election, the Conservative-dominated National Government lost 90 seats from the massive majority of 1931, but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons. During the campaign, Deputy Labour Leader Arthur Greenwood attacked Chamberlain for spending money on re-armament, stating that the re- armament policy was \\"the merest scaremongering, disgraceful in a statesman of Mr. Chamberlain's responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments\\". In January 1936, Edward VIII became king on the death of his father, George V. Chamberlain supported Baldwin's stance that King Edward must abdicate if he wished to marry the woman he loved, Wallis Warfield Simpson, a divorcee. After the conclusion of the Abdication Crisis, Baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the Coronation of King Edward's successor George VI. King George was crowned on 12 May 1937; Baldwin resigned on 28 May, advising the King to send for Chamberlain. Sir Austen did not live to see his brother's final \\"climb ... to the top of the greasy pole\\", having died two months earlier.  Appraisal  Blue plaque honouring Neville Chamberlain, Edgbaston, Birmingham Polemics such as Guilty Men, which helped demolish Chamberlain's reputation for his foreign policy as premier, also touched on his record as minister. These books blamed the National Government, in which Chamberlain had taken a leading role, for a failure to rearm. Historian David Dutton suggested in his book on Chamberlain that the damage to his reputation, both as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet minister, could have been contained had the Conservative Party defended his policies, but for 23 years after Chamberlain's death, the party leaders (Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) had made reputations as opponents of appeasement, and who were little minded to defend Chamberlain's record as a minister. The Labour landslide in the 1945 General Election cemented this inclination, with Macmillan stating that it was not \\"Churchill who had brought the Conservative party so low. On the contrary it was the recent history of the Party, with its pre-war record of unemployment and its failure to preserve peace.\\" The adoption of policies using Keynesian economics led to other criticisms of Chamberlain's ministerial record. Popular wisdom then held that governments could keep unemployment at a low level through spending. Chamberlain's acceptance of unemployment as an inevitable part of the business cycle was seen as outdated. In 1958, as Prime Minister, Macmillan described a report advocating limits on public investment as \\"a very bad paper. Indeed a disgraceful paper. It might have been written by Mr. Neville Chamberlain's Government.\\" In 1961, a controversial biography of Chamberlain by Conservative Party chairman Iain Macleod defended Chamberlain's ministerial record. Macleod pointed out that Chamberlain had been a \\"most valiant\\" champion of rearmament as Chancellor as early as 1934, but that little was done. According to Time magazine, Macleod saw Chamberlain as a \\"humanitarian industrialist, [a] progressive Lord Mayor of Birmingham and a dedicated Minister of Health who was damned as a 'Tory socialist'[.] Chamberlain had worked tirelessly in the '20s and '30s for the 'noble and fascinating ideal' of fashioning a better life for Britain's workingman.\\" The 1960s and 1970s saw a further reassessment of Chamberlain as a Cabinet minister. Historians such as A. J. P. Taylor pointed out that while the 1930s were a decade of misery for some, for most Britons, it was a time of rising living-standards, with unemployment concentrated in only a few regions of the country. As economists and historians came to question the assumption that the National Government could have spent its way out of unemployment, Chamberlain's tenure as Chancellor was to an extent rehabilitated. American social historian Bentley Gilbert stated that Chamberlain was \\"the most successful social reformer in the seventeen years between 1922 and 1939 ... after 1922 no one else is really of any significance.\\" According to Taylor, writing in 1965, Chamberlain did more to improve local government while serving as Health Minister than did anyone else in the 20th century. In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher instituted economic policies reminiscent of Chamberlain's as Chancellor‚Äîcontrol of inflation (even at the expense of unemployment), minimisation of budget deficits, and low rates of direct taxation. This was a point not lost on the Labour Party, and the Trades Union Congress adopted a slogan of \\"Forwards to the Eighties not Backwards to the Thirties\\". Thatcher's critics denigrated both her policies and those of the 1930s in such comparisons, but she did not care to defend those of the 1930s. Thatcher stated that the historical justifications for her economic positions were the policies of the Victorian era. Dutton, who traced the progress of Chamberlain's reputation through the years, wrote in 2001 that Chamberlain's accomplishments at the Ministry of Health were \\"considerable achievements by any standards\\" and stated that they should not be seen in isolation, but as part of \\"the authentic Chamberlain, a man who was throughout his life on the progressive left of the Conservative party, a committed believer in social progress and in the power of government at both the national and local level, to do good.\\" Five years later, Chamberlain biographer Graham Macklin quoted Dutton in noting the eclipse of Chamberlain's earlier accomplishments by his later policy of appeasement:  Parliamentary election results   Notes   Explanatory notes   Citations   References   Books      Journals   Online sources   (RPI equivalents) *  External links  University of Birmingham Special Collections The political papers of Neville Chamberlain Chamberlain, Neville Early Life And Career 19th century in the United Kingdom 20th century in the United Kingdom 20th century in politics Chamberlain, Neville ","title":"Rise of Neville Chamberlain"},{"id":"25088939","text":"V429 Geminorum (BD+20¬∞1790) is a young orange dwarf star in the constellation Gemini, located nearly 85 light years away from the Sun.

The T110 was developed from the Triumph Thunderbird and first appeared in 1954. Although it was supposed to be the sports model of the Triumph range, the Tiger 110 was later fitted with the rear paneling that was introduced with Triumph's 350cc 3TA twin in 1959. This rear cowling earned it the nickname 'bathtub' from its shape and made the T110 look somewhat staid. In any event, from 1959, the T120 Bonneville was now Triumph's leading sports model and before the introduction of Edward Turner's unit construction 650cc twin in 1962, the T110 was dropped from Triumph's range.

The originally cast iron cylinder block and head soon were replaced with a light alloy cylinder head with special airways to improve cooling and austenitic iron valve seat inserts. The external oil feed pipes were also replaced with internal oilways via the pushrod tubes.

Reviews In a review of Wang's 2011 Carnegie Hall debut, The New York Times wrote: In June 2012, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Wang is \\"quite simply, the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today, and there's nothing left to do but sit back, listen and marvel at her artistry.\\" From a May 2013 Carnegie Hall concert, The New York Times reported that Wang's \\"fortissimos were fearsome, but so, in a quieter way, were the longing melodic lines of the first movement of Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2.\\" The reviewer added: > The liquidity of her phrasing in the second movement of Scriabin's Sonata > No. 2 eerily evoked the sound of woodwinds. In that composer's Sonata No. 6 > she juxtaposed colors granitic and gauzy to eerily brilliant effect before > closing the written program with a rabid rendition of the one-piano version > of \\"La valse\\", accentuating the sickliness of Ravel's distorted waltzes. In May 2016, The New York Times reviewed her performance of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata: > Ms. Wang's virtuosity goes well beyond uncanny facility. Right through this > Beethoven performance she wondrously brought out intricate details, inner > voices and harmonic colorings. The first movement had √©lan and daring. The > scherzo skipped along with mischievousness and rhythmic bite. In the grave, > great slow movement, she played with restraint and poignancy. She kept you > on edge during the elusive transition to the gnarly, dense fugue, which she > then dispatched with unfathomable dexterity. This was not a probing or > profound Hammerklavier. But I admired Ms. Wang's combination of youthful > energy and musical integrity. Wang has received attention for her eye-catching outfits and glamorous stage presence as well as for her piano playing. In a much-quoted 2011 review of a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles Times classical music critic Mark Swed wrote: Swed was criticised for this aspect of his review in a Washington Post article titled \\"Which offends? Her short dress or critic's narrow view?\\".\\"Which offends? Her short dress or critic's narrow view?\\" by Anne Midgette, The Washington Post, August 12, 2011 In 2017, Michael Levin of the HuffPost described Wang after her concert with Leonidas Kavakos at David Geffen Hall as \\"the world's greatest living pianist\\".

It is known as one of the icons of Abu Dhabi and has a futuristic design. Design The hotel is located within the Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi. The building, designed by Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture, principals of New York based Asymptote Architecture, consists of two 12 storey hotel towers, one set within the race circuit and another placed in the Marina itself, linked together by a monocoque steel and glass bridge and Grid Shell structure that both cross above and over the Yas Marina Circuit F1 race track.The big picture: The Yas Hotel, Abu Dhabi Business Traveller, 15 September 2009 Asymptote designed the building as an architectural landmark that embodies key influences and local as well as global inspirations that range from the aesthetics and forms associated with speed and spectacle to the artistry and geometries that form the basis of ancient Islamic art and craft traditions. Of architectural and engineering significance is the main feature of the hotel ºs design: a 217-meter expanse of sweeping, curvilinear glass and steel facade known as the Grid Shell: it features an LED lighting system that illuminates all 5,389 glass elements individually, with an integrated control system that updates color and brightness of each glass pane 20 times per second. The Grid Shell is a key feature of the overall architectural design and significance of the project. It creates an atmospheric-like veil that is visible from miles away. The hotel was designed by Asymptote to become a significant and important landmark for Abu Dhabi. For the dynamic facade lighting design, the architects collaborated with Rogier van der Heide and his team at Arup Lighting.

The museum is housed in a building in Tbilisi. It was designed by a well-known architect of the time, Paul Stern, and is an example of gothic and Islamic architecture. Museum building today In 1882, German Prince Constantine Oldenburg (1850-1906) met Agraphina Japaridze in Kutaisi. At the time she was married to Georgian nobleman from the House of Dadiani. Prince Oldenburg confessed his love for her. Prince Oldenburg's confession turned Agraphina Japaridze's head; they eloped and left Kutaisi and went to settle in Tbilisi. Prince Oldenburg commissioned the building of the palace for his beloved as a token of his great affection for her. In 1927, the Museum of Theatre, founded by David Arsenishvili (1905-1963)- a famous Georgian public figure (later appointed as the First Director of the Andrei Rublev Museum in Moscow), was moved to the building. The museum has more than 300,000 objects that provide information on the development of Georgian theatre, cinema, circus, folklore, opera, and ballet, as well as providing insight into the lives of figures in respective fields. Some museum exhibits date back to the classical era. Of particular note is an antique mask which was excavated by archeologists in the town of Vani.

One of the first exhibits of the museum was a curtain designed by Russian artist Konstantin Somov for the Free Theatre which was established in Moscow by Kote Marjanishvili in 1913. The curtain was thought lost until it was rediscovered in the basement of one of the theaters in Moscow in 1930 and was later given to this museum.

Even when the group appears in a hierarchical organization, for example the Roman Catholic Church, the group is only serving that particular church, not with the larger organization. It is known under different names such as the Society of Mary and Martha, The Daughters (and Sons) of Mary and Martha, Saints Martha and Mary Altar Society, MOMS, and marthas (sic). Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, by Jan Breugel the Younger and Peter Paul Rubens Biblical references The name comes from the Christian Bible references to Mary and Martha. The prevalent reference is Luke the Evangelist Luke10:39-42. In this passage, Christ and his followers were invited to Martha‚Äôs home for a meal. While Martha busied herself preparing the meal, Mary sat with Christ and the others. Martha was agitated because Mary was not helping prepare the meal. She asked Christ if He did not care. Christ gently reminded her that the meal was not the important task, but the hearing of His Word was the \\"one thing needful.\\" Mary and Martha also appear in the gospel of John the Apostle John, Jn11:1-44 and Jn12:2-8. Service The society provides various services. As a Martha the society provides, relief to the poor, hospitality after service, creation of orphanages, provide for missionary services, schools, hospitals, burial for indigents, fund raising, cookbook writing and sales, and maintenance of church buildings. As a Mary the society provides, Christian education and personal spiritual growth. One member explains in her letter on behalf of Brook Highland Community Church,\\"‚Ä¶ we chose the name \\"Mary and Martha Society\\" because we felt that it identified us with both internal and external service projects, which was our primary mission.\\" The constitution for the Mary and Martha Society of SS. Peter and Paul Church of Waterloo, Illinois states that their primary interest is their bond of friendship between the ladies of the congregation and the financial assistance of the parochial school. Chronology The earliest mention of the society is in 1836 where the Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity took control of the Society in four churches of Saint Peter, Saint Joseph, Saint Aloysius and Saints Peter and Paul. Their records indicate that the founding of the Society goes back to 1836 with the Sisters of Santa Maria. In 1877, Saint Mary‚Äôs African Methodist Episcopal \\"AME\\" church notes that North Carolina Negroes were members of the society. In 1880, The Sons and Daughters of Mary and Martha were prevalent in Upson County, Georgia. References in obituaries and burial markers shows the society spread from North Carolina to Canada from 1845 to 1972 Internet references note the denominations to be Roman Catholic, Russian Orthodox, Church of Christ, Congregational, AME, Evangelical and Reformed, Christian Reformed, Lutheran, Episcopal, Community and American Baptist. In 1986, a book, The Fat Pigeon Files, published by a Christian retreat house in Devon England humorously notes the effect of the Mary and Martha Society on the life of a parish minister. The Mary and Martha Society continues into the Twenty-first Century with active groups from Bay City Michigan to Albuquerque New Mexico and from Birmingham Alabama to Vancouver Canada. Notes The Benedictine Sisters has a large network of volunteer groups named MOMS. Correspondence with a principal author of the materials for the group suggests no relationship with the Mary and Martha Society. Inquiries to the Canadian and English groups provided no further information. The marthas (sic) are named this way as an act of humility after the fashion of e. e. cummings. Miscellany Anderson, M.

By her marriage, she was a Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Early life Catherine was born in Moscow and baptized at Chudov Monastery; her godparents were her uncle Tsar Peter I and her great- aunt Princess Tatiana (daughter of Tsar Michael I). She was the third of five daughters, but the early deaths of her older sisters Maria (on 23 February 1692, aged three) and Feodosia (on 22 May 1691, aged one) left her as the eldest child of her parents. Two more sisters were born later: Anna, the future Russian Empress, and Praskovia (born 14 October 1694 - died 19 October 1731). Catherine (reportedly the favorite child of her mother), spent her childhood in her mother's estate of Izmaylovo, also the birthplace of her paternal grandfather, Tsar Alexis. Like her younger sisters, she received an occidental education: the study of German and French languages, dancing and etiquette. Her teachers were Johann-Dietrich Christopher Osterman (brother of the future Vice-Chancellor) and Frenchman Etienne Rambur. Of Ivan V's daughters, she seems to have been the most capable. In 1708 the family moved to the new capital, Saint Petersburg. Marriage According to contemporaries, Catherine was a short, dark-haired, and pale beauty and was a popular socialite with her charm and sociability. At the request of her uncle Peter I, she was married on 19 April 1716 in Danzig to Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He had initially proposed to Catherine's sister Anna (then Dowager Duchess of Courland) but Peter I instead chose Catherine to be his bride. The marriage created a political alliance between Russia and Mecklenburg against Sweden, and was advantageous to Peter, as he wanted to use the port of Mecklenburg to harbour his fleet. According to the marriage contract, the Duke agreed to his future wife keeping her Orthodox faith, and to pay her 6,000 thalers per year. Peter I would, in return, contribute to the Duke's attempts to conquer the town of Wismar. They had two daughters: Elisabeth Catherine Christine (born in Rostock on 18 December 1718), and one unnamed (who was either stillborn or died immediately after birth on 18 January 1722).Ekaterina Ivanovna Romanova in: Genealogy Database by Herbert Stoyan [retrieved 18 November 2014]. The marriage was unhappy, as Karl Leopold abused Catherine. She returned to Russia in 1722 with her surviving daughter. The couple never divorced, but they never saw each other again. Later life in Russia On the death of Peter II in 1730, the Supreme Privy Council considered Catherine as a candidate for the tsardom as the eldest daughter of Ivan V, but the fear that her spouse would gain influence in Russia and her own independent and capricious nature led to her widowed younger sister Anna, Duchess of Courland, being chosen instead, because she was considered more docile. Catherine Ivanovna's Gravestone at Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Catherine was involved in the events of 7 March 1730, when a group of nobles (between 150 and 800, according to sources), among whom were many officers of the Guards, arrived at the palace and gave a petition to the Empress. In this petition they requested the re-examination of the form of government that would be pleasing to all the people. Anna hesitated, but Catherine reportedly forced the Empress to sign the petition. Catherine kept at her court one of the first Russian theaters, with serfs as actors.

On 12 May 1733, Catherine was present at her daughter's conversion to the Orthodox religion, where she received the name Anna Leopoldovna, in order to make her acceptable as an heiress to the throne. Catherine died one month later and was buried next to her mother in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra monastery.

Using interviews with five veterans from different generations of American wars, the film explores the definition of what being a 'good soldier' really means. Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States and a former bombardier in World War II, served as an advisor to the filmmakers. Synopsis The filmmakers follow the journey of five American veterans from World War II, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War as they sign up, participate in battle and finally change their perspective about the real meaning of war and being a good soldier. At the end, The Good Soldier poses the question: \\"What is it that makes a good soldier? Is it the ability to kill other human beings?\\" The film is composed of candid interviews with the veterans, who marched eagerly to defend their country in 1944, 1966, 1991, or 2003 only to return conflicted by the atrocities they saw and participated in, and questioning what true service to your country really means, The juxtaposition of these searing interviews with jarring on-the-ground archival footage exposes the brutality of combat, and honors the bravery not only of those who fight, but those who fight for change. In ultimately choosing to work for peace in the world, the heroes profiled in this film, have begun to take steps towards peace with themselves as well.

This process is genetically regulated, with the nucleic material responsible being an example of a conserved sequence ‚Äî one maintained through natural selection (though the pressures shaping this are unclear as will be discussed) since it arose in a common ancestor of all species now exhibiting it, via a phenomenon known to bioinformaticists as an orthologic sequence homology. The thymus involutes in almost all vertebrates, from birds, teleosts, amphibians to reptiles, though the thymi of a few species of sharks are known not to involute. T-cells are named for the thymus where T-lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to mature. Its regression has been linked to the reduction in immunosurveillance and the rise of infectious disease and cancer incidence in the elderly (in some cases risk is inversely proportional to thymus size). Though thymic involution has been linked to immunosenescence, it is not induced by senescence as the organ starts involuting from a young age: in humans, as early as the first year after birth.  Progression   Neonatal period  Though the thymus is fully developed before birth, Parham, P. 2005. The immune system: Second edition Garland Science. newborns have an essentially empty peripheral immune compartment immediately after birth. Hence, T lymphocytes are not present in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, where na√Øve, mature lymphocytes are stimulated to respond to pathogens. In order to populate the peripheral system, the thymus increases in size and upregulates its function during the early neonatal period.  Age-relatedness  Though some sources continue to cite puberty as the time of onset, studies have shown thymic involution to start much earlier. The crucial distinction came from the observation that the thymus consists of two main components: the true thymic epithelial space (TES) and the perivascular space (PVS). Thymopoiesis, or T-cell maturation, only occurs in the former. In humans, the TES starts decreasing from the first year of life at a rate of 3% until middle age (35‚Äì45 years of age), whereupon it decreases at a rate of 1% until death. Hypothetically, the thymus should stop functioning at around 105 years of age; but, studies with bone marrow transplant patients have shown that the thymi of the majority of patients over forty were unable to build a na√Øve T cell compartment.  Effects of the involution  The ability of the immune system to mount a strong protective response depends on the receptor diversity of naive T cells (TCR). Thymic involution results in a decreased output of na√Øve T lymphocytes ‚Äì mature T cells that are tolerant to self antigens, responsive to foreign antigens, but have not yet been stimulated by a foreign substance. In adults, na√Øve T-cells are hypothesized to be primarily maintained through homeostatic proliferation, or cell division of existing na√Øve T cells. Though homeostatic proliferation helps sustain TCR even with minimal to nearly absent thymic activity, it does not increase the receptor diversity. For yet unknown reasons, TCR diversity drops drastically around age 65. Loss of thymic function and TCR diversity is thought to contribute to weaker immunosurveillance of the elderly, including increasing instances of diseases such as cancers, autoimmunity, and opportunistic infections.  Acute thymic involution and treatment implications  There is growing evidence that thymic involution is plastic and can be therapeutically halted or reversed in order to help boost the immune system. In fact, under certain circumstances, the thymus has been shown to undergo acute thymic involution (alternatively called transient involution). For example, transient involution has been induced in humans and other animals by stresses such as infections, pregnancy, and malnutrition. The thymus has also been shown to decrease during hibernation and, in frogs, change in size depending on the season, growing smaller in the winter Wytycz, B., Mica, J., Jozkowir, A. & Bigaj J. 1996. Letters: Plasticity of thymuses of ectothermic vertebrates. Immunology Today (Comment). 442: No.9. Studies on acute thymic involution may help in developing treatments for patients, who for example are unable to restore immune function after chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, or infections like HIV.  Unknown selective pressures  Thymic involution remains an evolutionary mystery since it occurs in most vertebrates despite its negative effects. Since it is not induced by senescence, many scientists have hypothesized that there may have been evolutionary pressures for the organ to involute. A few hypotheses are as follows: Developing T cells that interact strongly with antigen being presented within the thymus are induced to undergo programmed cell death. The intended effect is deletion of self- reactive T cells. This works well when the antigen being presented within the thymus is truly of self origin, but antigen from pathogenic microbes that happens to infiltrate the thymus has the potential to subvert the entire process. Rather than deleting T cells that would cause autoimmunity, T cells capable of eliminating the infiltrating pathogen are deleted instead. It has been proposed that one way to minimize this problem is to produce as many long-lived T cells as possible during the time of life when the thymus is most likely to be pristine, which generally would be when organisms are very young and under the protection of a functional maternal immune system. Thus, in mice and humans, for example, the best time to have a prodigiously functional thymus is prior to birth. In turn, it is well known from Williams' theory of the evolution of senescence that strong selection for enhanced early function readily accommodates, through antagonistic pleiotropy, deleterious later occurring effects, thus potentially accounting for the especially early demise of the thymus. The disposable soma hypothesis and life history hypothesis say similarly that tradeoffs are involved in thymic involution. Since the immune system must compete with other bodily systems, notably reproduction, for limited physiological resources, the body must invest in the immune system differentially at different stages of life. There is high immunological investment in youth since immunological memory is low. There are also hypotheses that suggest that thymic involution is directly adaptive. For example, some hypotheses have proposed that thymic involution may help in avoidance of autoimmunity or other dangers, prevention of infection, and production of an optimal repertoire of T-cells. Zinc deficiency may also play a role.

Washington: Government Printing Office, 1887. He is associated with a number of buildings that are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Biography William Alfred Freret was born in New Orleans. His father was William Freret, a mayor of the city, and his cousin James Freret was a fellow architect with whom he sometimes collaborated. He was educated in his native city and in Baton Rouge. William received an engineering degree in England and adopted architecture as his profession. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he entered the Confederate Army as a private in the Washington Artillery from New Orleans. He was promoted from time to time, finally reaching the rank of lieutenant- colonel of engineers. He served on Kirby Smith's staff, and was also assistant chief and acting chief of the Trans-Mississippi Department until the surrender. From 1866 to 1868 he was state engineer for Louisiana, and for several years after that he had charge of the construction of the public schools of the McDonogh fund, some sixteen in number. He served as supervising architect of the U.S. government from June, 1887, until March, 1890, when he resigned. W. A. Freret designed the reconstructed statehouse at Baton Rouge after the Civil War. He was the architect for the buildings of the state university at Pineville, the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, and many of the public buildings and private residences in New Orleans and elsewhere in Louisiana and several of the neighboring states. Projects Works include: *Old Louisiana State Capitol, North Blvd. and St. Philip St. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, built 1847-50, NRHP-listed After James H.

Smart, Neal E. Hass, and Allan Paull. \\"Flight Data Analysis of the HyShot 2 Scramjet Flight Experiment\\", AIAA Journal, Vol. 44, No. 10 (2006), pp. 2366-2375.  Overview  The project has involved the successful launch of one engine designed by The University of Queensland, and one launch of the scramjet designed by the British company QinetiQ. Each combustion unit was launched on the nose of a Terrier-Orion Mk70 sounding rocket on a high ballistic trajectory, reaching altitudes of approximately 330 km. The rocket was rotated to face the ground, and the combustion unit ignited for a period of 6‚Äì10 seconds while falling between 35 km and 23 km at around Mach 7.6. The system is not designed to produce thrust. * The first HyShot flight was on 30 October 2001 but was a failure due to the rocket going off course. * The first successful launch (Hyshot II) was of a University of Queensland scramjet on 30 July 2002. It is believed by many to be the first successful flight of a scramjet engine, although some dispute this and point primarily to earlier tests by Russian scientists.A.Roudakov, V.Semenov, J.Hicks \\"Recent Flight Test Results of the Joint CIAMNASA Mach 6.5 Scramjet Flight Program\\" NASA/TP-1998-206548. Also of note was the successful achievement of thrust by GASL scramjets launched on June 20 and July 26, 2001 under DARPA sponsership. * A second successful flight (HyShot III) using a QinetiQ scramjet was achieved on 25 March 2006. The later QinetiQ prototype is cylindrical with four stainless steel combustors around the outside. The aerodynamics of the vehicle is improved by this arrangement but it was expensive to manufacture. * The HyShot IV flight on 30 March 2006 launched successfully, and telemetry was received, however it is believed that the scramjet did not function as expected. Data analysis is required to confirm what occurred. * HyCAUSE was launched on 15 June 2007. (The HyCAUSE experiment differed from the HyShot launches in that a Talos-Castor combination was used for launch and the target Mach number was 10.) The carrier rocket for the HyShot experiments was composed of a RIM-2 Terrier first stage (6 second burn, 4000 km/h) and an Orion second stage (26 second burn, 8600 km/h, 56 km altitude). A fairing over the payload was then jettisoned. The package then coasted to an altitude of around 300 km. Cold gas nitrogen attitude control thrusters were used to re-orient the payload for atmospheric reentry. The experiments each lasted for some 5 seconds as the payload descended between approximately 35 and 23 kilometers altitude, when liquid hydrogen fuel was fed to the scramjet. Telemetry reported results to receivers on the ground for later analysis. The payload landed about 400 km down range from the launch site, at which time its temperature was still expected to be about 300 degrees Celsius, which may be enough to cause a small brush fire and thereby make spotting and recovery easier even though a radio beacon was in the payload. There has been much analysis of the data obtained in flight and comparison with results from experiments conducted in ground-testing facilities.Gardner, AD; Hannemann, K; Paull, A; Steelant, J \\"Post flight analysis of the HyShot supersonic combustion flight experiment in HEG\\", In: Proceedings of the Fifth European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles.

Latillas in a Viga Roof Vigas are wooden beams used in the traditional adobe architecture of the American Southwest, especially New Mexico. In this type of construction, the vigas are the main structural members carrying the weight of the roof to the load-bearing exterior walls. The exposed beam ends projecting from the outside of the wall are a defining characteristic of Pueblo architecture and Spanish Colonial architecture in New Mexico and often replicated in modern Pueblo Revival architecture. Usually the vigas are simply peeled logs with a minimum of woodworking. In traditional buildings, the vigas support latillas (laths) which are placed crosswise and upon which the adobe roof is laid, often with intermediate layers of brush or soil. The latillas may be hewn boards, or in more rustic buildings, simply peeled branches. These building techniques date back to the Ancestral Puebloan peoples, and vigas (or holes left where the vigas have deteriorated) are visible in many of their surviving buildings. Since the modern Pueblo Revival style was popularized in the 1920s and 1930s, vigas are typically used for ornamental rather than structural purposes. Noted architect John Gaw Meem incorporated ornamental vigas into many of his designs. Contemporary construction in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is controlled by stringent building codes, typically incorporates ornamental vigas, although the latest revision of the residential building code gives credit for structural vigas. Older structures that have been reconstructed (e.g. the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe) may contain both structural and ornamental vigas. Composition Vigas are typically about 6 to 10 inches (15.24 to 25.4 cm) in diameter and average 15 feet (4.6 m) long and are commonly used in interior spaces. Pinyon (Pinus edulis) and Ponderosa Pine were the most common wood species used in Viga construction during the 17th century. Engelmann spruce is the preferred wood \\"for the wood character and lack of cracking,\\" but Ponderosa pine (Pinus Ponderosa) is more commonly used. Wood characteristics, availability of trees, and transportation issues defined room depths that were mostly no longer than 15 feet (4.6 m). A layer of smaller branches or saplings known as latillas or Latias (laths) covers the top of the Vigas with Adobe for insulation and water repeal. Although in prehistoric times Vigas were reused from old constructions to new buildings, this practice depended on the history of some sites since some Spanish settlement reused them such as the Walpi. In the 19th century, the traditional craftsmanship of Vigas changed with the arrival of the railroad in the 1880s and immigrants from the east coast. New dimensioned 2\\" X 4\\" (50 mm x 100 mm) lumber was introduced in the area. Materials Cutting trees for Vigas was usually done in Winter because of the good temperatures. ‚ÄúDead and down‚Äù trees were the preferred source for Vigas in the adjacent forests. Traditional Vigas were usually cut to length with metal axes. Latillas were also collected, along with other construction materials at the same time. To make transportation easier wood preparation usually was done before shipment. Large labor crews were involved and Vigas were transported by teams of Oxen from the mountains. Some construction historians have mentioned the use of latillas under the vigas for carrying poles. Wood cutting was an important aspect of material production. If cutting was done shorter than needed, the builders had to wait until one year later to get the same material thus representing a problem. These issues led to some structural and designing decisions in constructions like the building of second walls inside the proposed building so shorter materials can be used. Large diameter Vigas were cut first so they can dry or cury for a longer period. As lighter elements for transportation, Latillas or Latias were cut last of various types of wood. In buildings, these were also laid in different patterns to the Vigas and painted in a different colors. The 1846 American immigration brought notions of New England architecture. New technologies substituted the use of Vigas for Machine-sewed beams, among other construction technologies that followed to the 20th century. This practice did not interfere with the use of Vigas mostly for decorative purposes in the Pueblo Revival Style architecture between the 1920s and 1930s. Structural assembly Traditional Vigas were mostly used for structural purposes in buildings. Vigas were spaced among other 3 feet (0.91 m) apart, although irregular or unequal spaced was characteristic of Spanish colonial architecture. Forms of Vigas varies from large institutional buildings to small ones. The amount of Vigas used in rooms vary, but six was the standard. Some rooms like in Acoma, are roofed with five to nine Vigas. Also, other structural practices were added to later buildings such as placing horizontal bond beams to transfer structural loads to the adobe roof. The extension of Vigas some feet (meters) outside of the Wall as a standard practice. This was used for the creation of Portals or covered porches. An Umbral or lintel was added for support of the Viga along with vertical posts in these spaces. The portal‚Äôs roof treatment was the same as interiors and the space provided for different uses. Vigas were usually installed with the smaller ends to one side of the roof to facilitate good drainage. Also, Vigas usually sat directly on the adobe or stone walls and strapped. Decorative Corbels were used in Portales and in the interiors. New technologies, especially in the Pueblo Revival Architecture were integrated. The practice of anchoring Vigas with rebar through pre-drilled holes at opposing angles and the designing of parapets for anchoring, was ideal for Vigas in low flat roofs. This was used to prevent roof uplift. The vaulted Viga roof is another type of structural system using vigas, using parapets on the two side and eaves on the ends. The roof is left exposed on the interior and latillas are placed parallel with others in a diagonal pattern.

In 1974 it was merged to be part of the administrative county of Leicestershire, but in 1997 it was separated to become a unitary local authority, which is responsible for all local services apart from the police and fire service. It is mainly rural, but has two market towns, Oakham, the county town, and Uppingham. The county has an area of , and the 2011 census showed a population of 37,400. In England, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are designated by Natural England, a non-departmental public body which is responsible for protecting England's natural environment. Designation as an SSSI gives legal protection to the most important wildlife and geological sites. As of November 2017, there are 19 SSSIs in the county. Sixteen are designated for their biological importance, one for its geological importance and two under both criteria. The largest site is Rutland Water at , a Ramsar internationally important wetland site and a Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. The smallest is Tolethorpe Road Verges at , which has several regionally uncommon plants on Jurassic limestone.

After graduating with an honours degree in fashion-knitwear design, Orta began practising as a visual artist in 1991. Her sculptural work investigates the boundaries between the body and architecture, exploring their common social factors such as communication and identity. Orta's most emblematic works include: Refuge Wear and Body Architecture (1992‚Äì1998), portable architecture, lightweight and autonomous structures representing issues of survival. Nexus Architecture (1994‚Äì2002) are participative interventions in which a variable number of people wear suits connected to each other, shaping modular and collective structures, which visualise the concept of social link. Urban Life Guards (2004‚Äìongoing) are wearable objects that reflect on the body as a metaphorical supportive structure. Orta‚Äôs work has been the focus of major survey exhibitions at the Wiener Secession Vienna (1999); USF Contemporary Art Museum, Tampa (2001), for which she received the Andy Warhol Foundation grant; and Barbican Art Gallery, London (2005).

Formed in 1994, it consists of Christine Sandtorv, Inger-Lise St√∏rksen and Jannicke Larsen. History Their first album, Glue, was released in 1996. After several years of touring, studying music, and writing new songs, a second album, Sun, was released in 2000. That album earned the band a Best Group nomination in the Spellemannprisen awards, Norway's equivalent of the Grammy Awards. Three more albums were released across the next five years, and the band won the Spellemannprisen award in the category Best Pop Album for the album Balloons and Champagne (2002) and Air (2003). The band was an essential part of the defining ‚ÄúBergensb√∏lgen‚Äù (The Bergen Wave) that heavily influenced Norwegian music and paved the way for a new international recognition of Norwegian music and up and coming artists. Ephemera earned a solid fan base in Northern Europe and in Asia, and they have been an immense inspiration for new Norwegian artists now seen on stages in Norway and around the world. Their music is also found in films, commercials and TV-series. The band took a break in 2005 after extensive touring. The break however, was extended several times to give room for new professional careers and solo albums, in addition to family extensions. After two fully booked concerts in Oslo and Bergen in 2015 and 2016, the break finally seemed to reach an end.

Early life  Elliott Martin Browne was born in Zeals, Wiltshire, on 29 January 1900, the third son of Colonel Percival John Browne. He was educated at Eton College, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied modern history and theology. Between 1923 and 1930 he worked at a variety of jobs related to drama, in Kent, Doncaster, London and in the United States as assistant professor of drama at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh. In 1924 he married the actress Henzie Raeburn, who subsequently appeared in many of his productions. They had two sons.  First work with Eliot  In 1930 he returned to England and was appointed by George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, to be director of religious drama for the diocese. One of Browne's early assignments was to organise a pageant, The Rock, to raise funds for the building of Anglican churches. At the request of Bishop Bell, T. S. Eliot wrote a series of choruses linking the loosely historical scenes of the pageant, which was played by amateurs and presented at Sadler's Wells Theatre for a fortnight's run in summer 1934. After this success, Bell invited Eliot and Browne to work on a play to be written by Eliot and presented at the Canterbury Festival the following year, with Browne as director. The title was Murder in the Cathedral and it was this production that established the collaboration between Eliot as poet-playwright and Martin Browne as director which was to last for twenty years. This first production, with Robert Speaight as Becket, was staged in the chapter house at Canterbury and was then taken to London, where it ran for almost a year. It established Browne as the leading director of the \\"poetic drama\\" movement, which was then undergoing something of a revival. The American premiere, in New York, followed in February 1938, with Browne himself playing Fourth Tempter. He succeeded Bishop Bell as President of the Religious Drama Society of Great Britain (\\"RADIUS\\").RADIUS home, RADIUS history In March 1939 he directed Eliot's second play, The Family Reunion, in London and in the same year he launched a touring company which he called the \\"Pilgrim Players\\", whose programme was dominated by the plays of Eliot and, to a lesser degree, of James Bridie (O. H. Mavor), the Scottish dramatist. These tours continued until 1948.  Postwar  In 1945 Browne took over the 150-seater Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, and devoted it for the next three years to the production of modern verse plays, with first productions of plays by Christopher Fry, Ronald Duncan, Norman Nicholson and Anne Ridler, all directed by Browne himself. From 1948 to 1957 he was the director of the British Drama League, an organisation devoted to giving assistance to the work of amateur theatres. In 1951 he was appointed as director for the first major production since the middle of the sixteenth century of the York Mystery Plays, which he directed in the ruins of St Mary's Abbey, York, for the York Festival, part of the celebrations of the Festival of Britain. He undertook further productions of the plays in the same venue in 1954, 1957, and 1966.York Mystery Plays site Meanwhile he continued his collaboration with T. S. Eliot, directing The Cocktail Party in 1949, The Confidential Clerk in 1953, and The Elder Statesman in 1958. For six months of each year from 1956 to 1962 he served as visiting professor of religious drama at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, and from 1962 to 1965 he was drama adviser to Coventry Cathedral, directing the mediaeval mystery plays there in 1962 and 1964. In 1967 and 1968 he directed at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, the plays being Murder in the Cathedral, The Family Reunion, Thornton Wilder's Our Town and The Long Christmas Dinner, and the mediaeval morality play, Everyman. He was appointed CBE in 1952. Following the death of Henzie Raeburn, in 1974 he married Audrey Johnson. He died in the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, on 27 April 1980, survived by his second wife.

Iancu (born December 17, 1928 in RƒÉcoasa, Vrancea County) is a Romanian economist, Ph.D. in economics in 1972, visiting scholar at MIT in 1970/71, researcher and associate professor, member of the Romanian Academy (since 1993), the most respected and influential scientific forum in Romania. Academic Contributions * Aurel Iancu has published a large number of books and articles. He is one of the promoters of using mathematics in economics in Romania, and one of the few Romanian researchers who approached economic growth and its effect on natural resources and environment. Since 1990 he was involved in new research topics such as theory of economic policy, economic transition, integration, real, nominal and institutional convergence. * Since the price system was drastically distorted in the centralised economies and the energy saving was an important economic policy all over the world, the ideas to define, compute and interpret the direct, total (cumulated) and net energy consumption per product and branch, and to include them in the analysis of the branch structure of the national economy and in some economic decision were absolute novelties in economic research and literature of that period (1970‚Äì1980) marked by energy crisis (4-6). * While neoclassical economists involved in modelling economic growth were assuming a diminishing return on investment along with a rising development level, he demonstrated (in 1976), by statistical data, that the return on investment did not permanently diminish along with economic development. In the most developed countries, the return on investment tends to grow because of the effects of intangible factors (3). Once the assumption that the return diminishes is invalidated, also the old formulation of the thesis that national and regional economies generally tend to converge is invalidated, excepting the former European socialist countries and regions due to the cohesion politics of the EU along the integration process (8-11). * As a director for research of the Industrial Institute for Economics and as a vice-president executive of the Economic Department of the Romanian Academy, Aurel Iancu initiated and co-ordinated research programmes and projects such as: impact of the economic growth on the natural resources and environment evolution, economic integration, economic convergence.

Between 1950 and 1956 he studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. In 1957 together with Otto Piene he started a series of what were called Abendausstellungen (evening exhibitions) at their studio in D√ºsseldorf.

Creation In 2008, the Ministry of Justice refused to register the party claiming that there were not enough participants at its inaugural meeting, but also that the programme failed to explicitly recognize the State of Lithuania's territorial integrity and indivisibility and the fact that the Lithuanian language is the national language. The Ministry finally registered the party in February 2009, a recognition that was indispensable for taking part to any election. Aims The Samogitian Party wants Samogitia to become an area where the Samogitian language would have official status and where Samogitians would have the right to declare their ethnic nationality. Membership and party structure The party has 1,100 members, according to party sources. Several local branches of the party have been established, including one in London, created in May 2009. Electoral results The Samogitian Party took part at the 2009 European Parliament election and received 6,961 votes (1.23% of the total). It got more than 4% of the votes (the electoral threshold for the municipal elections) in the four districts of the Tel≈°iai County, in the Ma≈æeikiai district municipality (544 votes, 6,27%), in the Rietavas municipality (95 votes, 5,04%), in the Plungƒó district municipality (356 votes, 5,76%) and in the Tel≈°iai district municipality (501 votes, 5,84%), and in three districts (out of seven) of the Klaipƒóda County, i.e. the Kretinga district municipality (373 votes, 5,67%), in the Skuodas district municipality (253 votes, 6,84%) and the Klaipƒóda district municipality (341 votes, 4,49%). In 2012, the party chairman Egidijus Skarbalius, participated as a candidate from The Way of Courage party. Political context The respondents in the various censuses do not have the option to choose for the Samogitian ethnicity, a situation similar to the Polish Kashubians and Silesians. This had already been contested before courts by the ≈Ωemaitƒì bova, ƒ´r ƒó b≈´s (\\"Samogitians were, are and will be\\") Association, also named ≈Ωemaitiu soeiga, which considers that it is a violation of the Constitution, more particularly of the provision that everyone has the right to decide on his nationality. According to Egidijus Skarbalius, the founder of the Samogitian Party, Samogitians could be as many as one million, thus representing a third of Lithuania's total population. By the end of 2008, the Council of Skuodas district municipality had decided from then on held all its meetings in the Samogitian language. Lithuanian councilmen will have access to interpreters if what is spoken is not entirely comprehensible.

DJ capped off his campaign with a win in the Garden State Stakes on October 19, 1946 and a year topper in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at Churchill Downs on November 2. His performances that year earned him American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors. Racing at age three, Double Jay was one of the early favorites for the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. However, he finished third in an allowance race in April at Churchill Downs and then was fifth in a six-horse field in the Derby Trial Stakes behind winner, Faultless and as a result, was sent off as a long-shot in the Derby. After finishing a distant twelfth in the Derby's thirteen-horse field he did not run in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. While he went on to win the important Jersey Handicap, he did not achieve the same level of success at three as he had at two. Racing at age four and five, Double Jay's most important win came in California in the 1949 American Handicap in which he equaled the track record of 1:48.60 for 1‚Öõ miles in the year when the race was run at Santa Anita Park. A Champion broodmare sire The sire of several good runners, Double Jay produced progeny that included: * Manotick (b. 1952) - won Ladies Handicap, Gazelle Stakes, Molly Pitcher Handicap * Bagdad (b. 1956) - wins included the San Antonio Handicap and Hollywood Derby * Irish Jay (b. 1957) - filly whose wins include the Spinaway Stakes, Demoiselle Stakes, Acorn Stakes, Comely Stakes * Sunrise Flight (b. 1959) - multiple stakes winner, damsire of Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, Pleasant Colony Double Jay was the North American Champion broodmare sire in 1971, 1975, 1977, and 1981 and was second in three other years: 1972, 1976, 1980. Of his daughter's successful progeny, Double Jay is best remembered as the damsire of: * Old Hat (b. 1959) - two-time American Champion Older Female Horse; * Nodouble (b. 1965) - American Champion Older Male Horse and 1981 Leading sire in North America; *John Henry (b. 1975) - two-time American Horse of the Year and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee; * Ferdinand (b. 1983) - won Kentucky Derby, Breeders' Cup Classic.

Founding Fellow, Cyprus Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts.  Life  Demetriou was born in Strongylo, Famagusta, Cyprus, on 15 August 1950. He is married to Julia Tsakalea and he has two sons, Pantelis and Demetris. After graduating from Pancyprium Gymnasium, the oldest secondary school in Cyprus, he went to Thessaloniki, Greece, where he studied psychology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He received a PhD in psychology in 1983. He was a professor of developmental psychology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki until 1996. He then moved to the University of Cyprus, where he was a professor of psychology until he became the Minister of Education and Culture. Currently he is professor of psychology and president of the University of Nicosia Research Foundation. He is also president of the Pancyprian Association of Psychologists.  Research  His research focuses on cognitive development. From the very beginning he attempted to develop a comprehensive theory of cognitive development aiming to integrate the empirically valid aspects of Piaget's theory with psychometric and cognitive theory. That is, the theory aimed to describe and explain intellectual development through the life span, individual differences in the rate and directions of intellectual development, and the cognitive mechanisms underlying development and individual differences. According to this theory, the human mind is organised in three functional levels. The first is the level of processing potentials, which involves information processing mechanisms underlying the ability to attend to, select, represent, and operate on information. The other two levels involve knowing processes, one oriented to the environment and another oriented to the self. The level oriented to the environment includes thought processes and functions that specialise in the representation and processing of information coming from different domains of the environment. Six domains are specified: Categorical, quantitative, causal, spatial, propositional, and social thought. The self-oriented level includes functions and processes oriented to monitoring, representing, and regulating processing potentials and the environment-oriented systems. It underlies executive control and planning and it generates self-perceptions that converge on a self-image that shape how we view and avail ourselves to problem solving and social interactions.

Present  As a Minister of Education and Culture from March 2008 to August 2011 he led a large programme of reforms in Cypriot education which includes the development of new curricula across all subjects and grades from preschool to senior high school and the expansion of the university system of the country. He also contributed to elevating Cypriot universities into regional centres of excellence and co-operation. Moreover, he reformed the system of cultural governance so that creators and people of culture are involved in the decision making mechanisms concerning arts and culture. Finally, he attempted to improve the efficiency of the Ministry through a series of changes in its administrative operation.

Kabwela had distributed graphic images of childbirth to government officials to illustrate the effects of a Zambian nurses' strike. Kabwela was acquitted of the obscenity charge.  Background  On July 13, 2009, Kabwela was arrested for \\"distributing obscene material\\": on June 10, in order to illustrate the effect of a strike by Zambian nurses, she sent government officials photographs of a woman giving birth in a hospital parking lot without benefit of medical assistance (the infant, who was in the breech position, suffocated during delivery). President Rupiah Banda declared that the images (which had been taken by the woman's husband, and which Kabwela had considered too graphic to publish) were pornographic, and ordered the arrest of the person responsible; Kabwela subsequently turned herself in to police. Her trial began in August 2009. The Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges against Kabwela \\"bogus\\", and Reporters Without Borders described the charges as \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"absurd.\\" On August 10, the Post published an editorial in support of Kabwela, calling the trial a \\"comedy of errors\\"; they were subsequently charged with contempt of court. Those charges were later dropped. As well, the Patriotic Front demonstrated in support of Kabwela, leading to clashes with supporters of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy. She was acquitted on November 16.

The afterword of Flirt contains several pages of discussion about Hamilton's inspiration for the novella as well as a comic by Jennie Breeden. Plot Flirt follows Anita as she is asked to raise the wife of the wealthy and powerful Tony Bennington. After refusing his request for a reanimation, Anita's lovers come to visit and Bennington reveals that his wife was a fan of Guilty Pleasures. Weeks later Anita comes across the werelions-for-hire Jacob and Nicky, who threaten to kill Micah, Nathaniel, and Jason unless she agrees to use her necromancy for their client. Anita is left with no choice but to comply, even as her inner werelioness reacts to Jacob and Nicky. Anita soon discovers that Bennington is behind the kidnapping and threats, only for her inner lioness to react to the situation. In order to keep Bennington safe Jacob sequesters Anita, only for her lioness to further react to Jacob and Nicky. The two hit men end up giving into the natures of their were-beasts and battle for the chance to mate with Anita. Anita attempts to chase and attack Bennington, only to be stopped by a third member of Jacob's pride, Silas. She manages to wound Silas but Anita is ultimately re-captured and knocked unconscious. When she regains consciousness Anita manages to feed the ardeur off of Nicky, despite the initial attempts of Jacob and his pride's witch. The end result is that Anita's magic completely dominates Nicky, turning him into a \\"slave\\" with no free will outside of what she allows him. Anita is then brought to the grave of Bennington's wife and forced to use Silas as a \\"White Goat\\". Due to his supernatural nature Anita raises the entire cemetery, overwhelming the protection laid down by the pride witch. This enables Anita to psychically contact Jean-Claude, who swiftly captures Bennington's men. Jacob flees with his pride's witch, but only after watching Anita kill Bennington and leaving behind the now rolled Nicky.

The second eldest of the famous and prolific 'seven famous Petyarre sisters' of Utopia (Ada Bird, Myrtle Petyarre, Violet Petyarre, Jean Petyarre and most notably Kathleen Petyarre and Gloria Petyarre), she was not herself a prolific artist. Nancy Kunoth Petyarre was best known for her fine dot designs representing the skin on the back of Arnkerrthe, the Mountain Devil Lizard. She is buried next to Emily Kame Kngwarreye in a little-known spot along the Sandover Highway. Petyarre was born at Soakage Bore, near Waite River, about 50 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs, sometime between 1934 and 1939 (reports conflict, and records do not exist). She grew up with four brothers, speaking the Anmatyerre language, in the area known as Utopia, where her parents, Topsey Pwerle and Mick Kngwarreye had lived traditional lives in the desert. It was not until she was in her forties, in the 1980s, that Nancy started painting. She worked first on batik and later on canvas. She also made carvings which have featured in many exhibitions. Her most famous works are \\"Mountain Devil Dreaming\\" and \\"Body Paint\\". Her first exhibition came when she was believed to be around 50 years old, at Sydney's S. H. Ervin Gallery as part of a group show in 1989.

Kern was so upset at winning with a song that had not been specifically written for a motion picture, and that had been published and recorded before the film was even released, that he petitioned the Motion Picture Academy to change the rules.

He wears a ribboned hat so he can be easily identified. Role The v≈ëf√©ly is a man (or sometimes these days a woman) who roughly takes the role of the best man, but has many more duties. He is the official host, organizer, coordinator, entertainer and Master of Ceremonies during the wedding. A v≈ëf√©ly can be a relative but more often he is an experienced professional hired by the families. The v≈ëf√©ly performs many of his roles partly by reciting comic verse which is based on well-known traditional forms but tailored to the individuals being married, and their families. Before the wedding Traditionally well before the wedding the v≈ëf√©ly helps to arrange the marriage, discusses the details with the families and gets the parents' approvals. On the day of the wedding the v≈ëf√©ly says goodbye to the parents in the name of the bridegroom at the groom's house and escorts the groom and his family to the bride's house. The v≈ëf√©ly recites comic verse and keeps the guests informed and looks after them to make sure they get enough drinks and food. At the bride's house the v≈ëf√©ly asks for the bride (sometimes the parents pretend that they would not give her away, and the v≈ëf√©ly plays their game by begging or even threatening them, tongue-in-cheek). After the parents \\"give up\\" the v≈ëf√©ly says goodbye in the name of the bride. At the wedding ceremonies The v≈ëf√©ly then leads the two united families to the church and to the civil ceremony.In Hungary, as in many other countries, the religious ceremony does not make the couple married in law, which is done some time soon before or after at a civil ceremony. In English law, the marriage service itself is enough if it is done in the established church, or in a synagogue (but not in a mosque or for other religions. Scots law differs, and in US law it varies from state to state. The wedding march is often accompanied by a live band playing traditional folk music. The v≈ëf√©ly guides the couple and manages the guests, for example he announces when it is time to congratulate them. After the wedding ceremonies Before the wedding breakfast the v≈ëf√©ly makes a speech then introduces the meals by describing them in comic poems. During the wedding party the v≈ëf√©ly helps the mood by having the guests play games. While the guests are dancing, the v≈ëf√©ly coordinates the waiters, the photographer, the cameraman and the band in the background to prepare everyone for the next event. Presenting the cake The v≈ëf√©ly recites part of a comic poem before presenting the wedding cake. Giving gifts At midnight, the v≈ëf√©ly says \\"the bride is for sale\\", which means the guests can have a short dance with the bride in exchange for wedding presents or some money (usually in envelopes). The v≈ëf√©ly acts as an auctioneer and helps to \\"sell\\" the bride (and sometimes the groom as well). This is the first \\"collective wealth\\" they get as a married couple. The guests may start throwing coins at them and when the \\"money sweeping\\" starts, as they grab the coins from the floor, they kick the coins around making them harder to retrieve, thus representing the joint housework and simulating the ups and downs in life. In some regions this tradition is so popular that some guests bring large numbers of coins. No-one is allowed to stop the money sweeping, but the v≈ëf√©ly can help by asking the guests after some time that they can help the pair instead of giving them a hard time. At midnight the pair leaves the guests for a few minutes, taking their money and presents. They change out of their formal wedding outfits, and return to the dancing. Sometimes the wedding party goes on all night and the remaining guests escort the pair home in the morning.

PGO governs the practice of professional geoscience in Ontario and reports to the Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. The legislation protects the public and investors by establishing a regulated association of geoscientists with the power to admit only qualified persons, to encourage continuing professional competence, to discipline members for professional misconduct and to prevent unqualified individuals from practising. The legislation brings Ontario geoscientists to the same level of standards and accountability as in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. PGO establishes and administers registration requirements, conducts complaint reviews and a discipline process, establishes practice standards and enforces reserve practice and title provisions in the Act.

Plot Dr. James Kildare finds competition for the affections of nurse Mary Lamont in the person of wealthy brain surgeon Dr. Gregory Lane. Kildare has not proposed to Mary because of his poor financial situation as an intern. Kildare's mentor, Dr. Leonard Gillespie, is informed that Paul Messenger, whose daughter Kildare cured in The Secret of Dr. Kildare, has arranged for Kildare to be offered a prestigious, lucrative position with the Messenger Institute. In the meantime Kildare has arranged for his inspiring but crusty mentor to see a cancer specialist about the melanoma Gillespie is battling. Despite the temptation of a high salary and a new home, Kildare turns down the job offer to continue to remain near Gillespie. As a result, Mary gives up all hope of marrying Kildare and is assigned as a staff surgical nurse to Lane. Kildare and Lane are put together on a case involving an unidentified patient with a skull fracture who is refusing the operation that would save his life. Lane knows the patient urgently needs the surgery but has lost confidence in himself because too many of his patients have died on the operating table. Kildare convinces Lane that Gillespie has full confidence in his skills and Lane proceeds with the operation. When the patient wakes up, he shows clear signs of insanity, putting Lane's career in jeopardy and subject to criminal prosecution. Kildare is convinced that the man was mentally ill before the accident which fractured his skull, and thus Lane had a legal right to perform the operation. He risks his own career by using a new treatment, the \\"insulin shock cure,\\" which succeeds. Questioning the patient for his identity and background, Kildare finds the man's estranged wife and learns that he had gradually lost his sanity over a five-year separation. Mary puts her own career on the line to protect Kildare until he returns with the wife. Gillespie fires Kildare to get him to propose to Mary. Seeing the couple reunited, she accepts, even knowing that their engagement will of necessity be a protracted one. Gillespie reveals that once again he has plotted to have Kildare find his own way through a difficult situation. Turning the tables, Kildare extracts a promise from Gillespie to accept the care of the cancer specialist in return for keeping Kildare on as his assistant.

After school, he attended Glasgow University and took the general arts degree before joining the family firm about 1850. He married Emily (d. 1901), daughter of George Clerk Arbuthnot, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. As a young man he had been in the Crimea at the fall of Sevastopol in 1855, and had subsequently been an advocate of good coastal defences and was the first to suggest to the government the use of merchant vessels for war purposes.1911, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica His father handed over control of the family businesses to him in 1860, the year he married, and he became a key figure, first as a partner, then as chairman, in the reconstruction and subsequent flotation of Cunard in 1878. Cunard began to replace its fleet of wooden paddle steamers with iron ships, first paddle driven, but increasingly employing the screw propeller. The first iron screw steamer was the China in 1862. Burns was particularly keen on economy, and the Cunard Line quickly adopted the new compound engine with the Batavia in 1870. Under Burns, Cunard was also quick to order a steel vessel, the first in their service being the SS Servia in 1881, which, apart from the Great Eastern, was the largest liner afloat at the time. By the 1890s, following his father's death, he began to process of handing on the management to his two sons, George and James. George A. Burns followed as Cunard chairman, as well as being partner and director of G. and J. Burns Ltd. James C. Burns, was widely involved in Clyde shipping circles and became chairman of the Glasgow Shipowners' Association at that time. Lord Inverclyde was a deputy lieutenant of Renfrewshire, of Lanarkshire, and of the county of the city of Glasgow. He was also a justice of the peace in Renfrewshire. As an honorary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, Burns was involved in setting up a training ship scheme which was established on HMS Cumberland. He travelled widely, and was a Fellow of The Royal Geographical Society. He was also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, The Travellers‚Äô, and The Glasgow Clubs. He was author of several literary works, including ‚ÄòA Wild Night‚Äô, Glimpses of Glasgow Low Life‚Äô, and, in 1887, The Adaption of Merchant Ships for War Purposes‚Äò. He inherited his father's Baronetcy in 1890 and was created Baron Inverclyde, of Castle Wemyss in the county Renfrew on 28 July 1897.L. G.

Cited by ThePeerage.com Burns had acquired Castle Wemyss from Charles Wilsone Brown of Wemyss Bay in 1860, and had the building enlarged and remodelled in Scottish Baronial style by Robert William Billings. In 1878, John Burns and his wife accompanied several other people, including writer Anthony Trollope, on a trip to Iceland aboard the Burns ship Mastiff. Trollope described the trip in his book How the 'Mastiffs' went to Iceland. He died on 12 February 1901; his wife Emily, dying the next day. They were interred together. He was succeeded by his son, George Arbuthnot Burns, 2nd Baron Inverclyde (1861‚Äì1905) References *The Glasgow Story *History of the Cunard Steamship Company, 1886 Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom 1829 births 1901 deaths People from Glasgow People associated with Inverclyde British businesspeople Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society ","title":"John Burns, 1st Baron Inverclyde"},{"id":"25090475","text":"Ulrich Gering (active as a printer in Paris from c. 1470 to 1508 - 23 August 1510) came from Berom√ºnster in the diocese of Constance.

The purpose of the EPA is to repair the damage done to the environment and to set up new criteria to allow Americans to make a clean environment a reality. The ultimate goal of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment. Since the 1980s sustainability has become a term used in reference to environmental and human issues. Sustainability is typically defined as, the ability of current generations to meet their own needs without compromising the needs of future generations. This concept has recently been adopted by the EPA as they have dedicated an entire sector solely to sustainability. Environmental, social, and economic demands are the main components that stand behind the concept of sustainability. As previously mentioned, the EPA has taken the initiative to establish a sector dedicated to promoting and practicing sustainability. This sector has been broken down into four broad categories: Urban Sustainability and the Built Environment; Water and Ecosystem Services; Energy, Biofuels, and Climate Change; and Material Management and Human Health. Urban sustainability and the built environment With almost 80% of all US residents inhabiting urban areas and a constant increase in urban growth, the EPA has worked with many types of council to create a sector based solely on urban sustainability and the built environment. Changing how and where urban development takes place can greatly affect habitat protection, water resources, energy consumption, the quality and services provided by an ecosystem, and indoor and outdoor air quality. With recent findings showing more than 40% of energy consumption comes from buildings, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) published a report with an extensive agenda for research and development to reduce the consumption of natural resources, improve indoor environments and reduce emissions of harmful pollutants. With this, the EPA has created programs and resources to help states and their communities with promoting urban sustainability and supporting smart growth projects, green infrastructure and building design, energy efficient homes and commercial buildings, as well as helping to support the development of sustainability metrics for urban development. Policies and programs The EPA has created over 25 policies and programs to help with urban sustainability, ranging from \\"Building America\\" which works with the residential building industry to develop and implement building processes that save builders and homeowners millions; to \\"Smart Growth and Schools\\" which gives information on the principals of smart growth to plan educational facilities; to \\"Watershed\\" which shows how using a watershed approach can help to protect our water resources. One of the more successful programs the EPA utilizes is the \\"Green Building\\" program. Green Building is the practice of building structures and using methods that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient. Many aspects go into Green Building such as the design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. This program helps to bring awareness to Green Building and create healthier, more resource-efficient aspects of construction. Research, tools and technology The sustainability sector of the EPA has helped with research, tools and technology of the built environment in many ways. One of the many tools they have helped to create is the Tools of Watershed Protection in Developing Areas. This program is an approach that uses eight tools that can be used to protect or restore water resources in an urbanized or developing watershed. The eight tools outlined in the watershed protection approach are land use planning, land conservation, aquatic buffers, better site design, erosion and sediment control, storm water best management practices, non-storm water discharges, and watershed stewardship programs. The watershed protection approach brings up key choices that a watershed manager should think about when using the eight tools as well as describing in great detail the purpose of the tools and outlining specific methods of how to utilize them. Assessments and performance measures One of the many ways the EPA measures environmental performance is with the Smart Growth Index (SGI). The Smart Growth Index is a GIS sketch model that is used to model alternative land use and transportation settings and assess their outcomes using signs of environmental performance. The EPA alone has worked with over 30 partners using the Smart Growth Index to produce land use and transportation decisions that arouse economic development, reduce monetary expenditures, protect the environment and improve quality of life. Water and ecosystem services The water and ecosystem services section of sustainability works to ensure that natural resources are conserved in a way that allows for current and future generations to have access to them. It also works to find a balance between these natural resources and economic and social interests. Agriculture stands as a huge industry throughout the world, and the EPA works with the agricultural sector to help them meet regulations on their compliances by practicing sustainable management. The EPA has developed a program called the Ecological Research Program which conducts research that focuses on ecosystem services. They are hoping that sustainability efforts and stewardship will be promoted as these services are discovered. The project is also working to create indicators for the assessment and identification of ecosystem services. The hope is that this research will allow decision makers to better understand the value of particular ecosystems and work to improve the stewardship of the land. Under EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, President‚Äôs George H. Bush‚Äôs appointee, so-called placed-based initiatives focused on interconnected land and water systems gained in importance because places resonated with the public in a way that parts-per-million just do not. EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William K. Reilly describes his agency‚Äôs reasons for pursuing place-based initiatives. Reflections on US Environmental Policy: An Interview with William K. Reilly Video, Transcript (see p4). Policies and programs The EPA has several programs ranging from agriculture to wetlands and everything in between. One of their programs, Cooperative Conservation is unique in that it extends to reach several other organizations that are working toward the same goal of sustainability. This program is a collaboration of partnership, stewardship and sustainability that works with over 80 groups and organizations to achieve environmental results larger than just what the EPA can provide. Research, tools and technology The sustainability sector of the EPA has also conducted a wide range of research to identify problem areas and identify essential tools to manage ecosystems that need to be protected. Monitoring is the key to success for any program implementation. The EPA has created the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) which works to discover the appropriate tools to assess the efficiency of ecological resources. This program is designed to increase understanding of the risks involved with current natural resources. Assessments and performance measures The EPA also releases reports on current trends of environmental resources and advisories for issues such as chemical contaminant levels. EPA has set up fish advisories, landscape ecological projects, national coastal condition reports and reports on the quality of American lakes. The fish advisories inform the public about possible health risks from high chemical contaminant levels. The advisory may recommend for people to limit and stop their consumption of certain fish species in particular regions. Landscape ecology projects focus on the relationships between the characteristics of the land and how they may tie in with possible risks of natural resources. Reports on national coastal condition provide information on the status of ecological and environmental components. The other report that EPA puts out through the water and ecosystem services sector is on the quality of American lakes; this informs both the public and Congress about the water quality in various lakes, rivers, and ponds within the United States. Energy, biofuels, and climate change With one of our country's chief provider of energy being one of the main contributors to climate change along with many other environmental issues, the EPA has come up with many ways to help combat our reliance on fossil fuels. With many fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil resulting in 86% of the primary energy produced in the world as of 2006, the EPA has developed many programs that promote efficient energy use and improve environmental quality without disturbing our energy supply. Policies and programs The EPA has created over 40 programs and policies towards helping to deal with biofuels and greenhouse gases as well as find ways to be more energy efficient and help to slow down climate change. Their climate programs provide models and processes to inventory greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate the effects of global change on the environment, human heath, and the US economy. Similarly, the EPA has also created the Clean Cities Program which supports public and private partnerships that organize clean burning alternative fuel vehicles and help to create the associated fueling infrastructure to improve the United States‚Äô energy security and air quality. Research, tools and technology The Distributed Energy Program is a highly successful program utilized by the EPA to support cost-effective research and development aimed towards costs and emission reduction, as well as improving the reliability and performance of the US electric energy infrastructure. The Distributed Energy Program presents solutions to many of the most critical energy and electrical problems such as brownouts, blackouts, energy security problems, issues with power quality, stricter emissions standards, transmission bottlenecks, and a better control on energy costs. Assessments and performance measures The EPA assesses and measures energy, biofuels, and climate change many different ways. One very effective measure used by numerous environmental programs is the Environmental Indicators Initiative (EII) which was developed in 2001 to help the EPA in improving their reporting on the standing and tendencies of environmental conditions. As part of the EII, the EPA developed the Report on the Environment (ROE) project as a national report for the public and policy makers on the conditions of the United States' environment. The report is used to answer 23 questions about new developments in land, water and ecological systems with potential connections to human health that are related to their mission. Material management and human health The EPA has also dedicated their time toward materials management & human health. Within the definition of sustainability lies the facets of many generations and therefore the long- term impacts created by man must be taken into consideration. The EPA has been involved in the promotion of the use of more environmentally friendly materials and chemicals since the development of its mission. Toxic chemicals pose threats to both the environment and people, but the EPA is working to lessen these impacts. EPA programs involved in the materials management & human health sector work to promote greener and cleaner products and production processes. These objectives not only benefit the environment, but they often result in costs that are less than traditional techniques. Policies and programs One of EPA‚Äôs most emphasized programs in this sector is called Children‚Äôs Health. Children are more vulnerable to effects of toxins or chemicals in the environment and the EPA has a priority for children‚Äôs health. The EPA has conducted much research in areas related to materials management and human health. They have studied air toxics, endocrine disruptors, pesticides, life cycle assessments, and more. There are over 20 other policies and programs in place for material management and human health. These include, but are not limited to environmental management systems, green suppliers network, national waste minimization program, pollution prevention partnerships, and sustainable futures. Each of aforementioned not only emphasize a greener environment, but they promote collaborative efforts among the target audiences. Research, tools and technology Several programs are dedicated to helping businesses and the larger industries to use more environmentally sound practices. There is a branch dedicated to the promotion of clean processes. The Clean Processes Branch works to provide applications that can be used in pollution prevention, reuse and recycling of materials, and understanding the life cycles of consumer products and industrial processes. Within this branch, research is conducted on green chemistry and engineering, metals recovery and recycling, pervaporation, watershed environmental and impact analysis, chemical process stimulation for waste reduction, and quantitative structure activity relationship. Assessments and performance measures Assessments and performance measures are also conducted by the EPA through reports, programs, and promotion of acceptable practices. For example, the EPA has a push for life cycle assessments. The life cycle assessment, also referred to as LCA, is a technique that is used to determine how a product or process impacts the environment from the very initial inputs to the final product. It is the interpretation of these results that can help companies to make decisions in favor of the environment.

One night, Barney appears in full scuba suit while drinking scotch. Lily pulls aside Claire (Sarah Wright), a blonde woman at the bar, warning her of Barney's villainy, and she sits down with the rest of the gang as they explain the events that lead up to that night. Barney and Robin are coping with the end of their relationship in their own different ways. Robin says she wants to focus on her career, but Marshall and Ted are convinced she will find the love of her life, citing several friends who gave up on dating to focus on their work, only to be married months later. Barney, on the other hand, decides to re-enter the dating scene, using his sacred \\"Playbook\\". The book describes a set of con artist scenarios designed by Barney to manipulate girls into bed. Meanwhile, Lily tries to set up Ted with Shelly, a fellow teacher. When she had originally tried to get them to meet, Lily found Ted and Marshall in the middle of a chicken-finger mouth-stuffing attempt, so she convinced her coworker that Ted was not there. However, Ted is stood up by Shelly; when Lily confronts her, she discovers that Shelly was seduced by an exotic man at MacLaren's. Lily realizes it was Barney and angrily confronts him. Barney describes the play he used, the \\"Lorenzo von Matterhorn\\", using fake websites, a smartphone, and an exotic name. Barney's next move is a play called the \\"he's not coming\\", where he seduces vulnerable girls at the top of the Empire State Building. One of the girls Barney picks up, however, is an actress friend of Lily's, and she steals the playbook when in Barney's apartment. Lily reveals the ploy to Barney and threatens to post the playbook on the Internet if he does not stop using it. Barney shows up at the apartment in a scuba suit, saying he has one last play, \\"The Scuba Diver\\". While preparing to post the playbook, Marshall is bamboozled as \\"The Scuba Diver\\" is not in the playbook, having been torn away by Barney. They go down to the bar, where Barney sits in a booth, planning to seduce Claire, the blonde by the bar. As they conclude the story there with Claire, they ask Barney what \\"The Scuba Diver\\" is, and he breaks down, saying his breakup with Robin was hurting him more than he thought, and this was how he coped. Touched, the gang convinces Claire to go out with Barney for a cup of coffee. After they leave, the gang gets a text message from Barney and finds the description of the \\"Scuba Diver\\" under their table at MacLaren's. It was actually an elaborate con; involving Lily's disgust at the playbook, revealing Barney's tricks to Claire, Barney's fake breakdown over his breakup, and his friends encouraging the prey to go with Barney. Finally, a new co-host, Don, arrives at Robin's pre-morning show, and Robin suddenly realizes that Ted and Marshall may have been right.

These transgressions include a wide variety of behaviors. The boundaries of relational transgressions are permeable. Betrayal for example, is often used as a synonym for a relational transgression. In some instances, betrayal can be defined as a rule violation that is traumatic to a relationship, and in other instances as destructive conflict or reference to infidelity. Relational transgressions are a part of any relationship. In each instance, partners must weigh the severity of the transgression against how much they value the relationship. In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless. With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks.Metts and Cupach, 2007 The transgressor's efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim. If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be forgiven by my partner just like every other time‚Äù). These risks aside, promptly engaging in repair strategies helps to ensure the relationship recovers from transgressions. Addressing relational transgressions can be a very painful process. Utilizing repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the relationship through redefining rules and boundaries. An added benefit can be gained through the closeness that can be realized as partners address transgressions. Engaging in relationship talk such as metatalk prompts broader discussions about what each partner desires from the relationship and aligns expectations. Such efforts can mitigate the effects of future transgressions, or even minimize the frequency and severity of transgressions. Scholars tend to delineate relational transgressions into three categories or approaches. The first approach focuses on the aspect of certain behaviors as a violation of relational norms and rules. The second approach focuses on the interpretive consequences of certain behaviors, particularly the degree to which they hurt the victim, imply disregard for the victim, and imply disregard for the relationship. The third and final approach focuses more specifically on behaviors that constitute infidelity (a common form of relational transgression). Common forms of relational transgressions include the following: dating others, wanting to date others, having sex with others, deceiving one's partner, flirting with someone else, kissing someone else, keeping secrets, becoming emotionally involved with someone else, and betraying the partner's confidence.Guerrero, Andersen, & Afifi, 2007  Conceptual and operational definitions  Rule violations Rule violations are events, actions, and behaviors that violate an implicit or explicit relationship norm or rule. Explicit rules tend to be relationship specific, such as those prompted by the bad habits of a partner (e.g., excessive drinking or drug abuse), or those that emerge from attempts to manage conflict (e.g., rules that prohibit spending time with a former spouse or talking about a former girlfriend or boyfriend). Implicit rules tend to be those that are accepted as cultural standards for proper relationship conduct (e.g., monogamy and secrets kept private). The focus on relational transgressions as rule violations presents an opportunity to examine a wide range of behaviors across a variety of relationship types. This method facilitates analysis of transgressions from a rules perspective. In a study of college students' relational transgressions, the following nine categories emerged consistently.Metts and Cupach, 2007, p. 246 # Inappropriate interaction: Instances in which a partner performs badly during an interaction, typically a conflict episode. # Lack of sensitivity: Instances in which a partner exhibits thoughtless, disrespectful, or inconsiderate behavior. Offender demonstrates a lack of concern or emotional responsiveness when expected and appropriate. # Extrarelational involvement: Sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party. Offender does not confound involvement with deception. # Relational threat confounded by deception: Instances in which a partner participates in sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party and then uses deception to conceal the involvement. # Disregard for primary relationship: Actions that indicate the transgressor does not privilege the primary relationship; chooses other people or activities over partner or changes plans. # Abrupt termination: Actions that terminate a relationship with no warning and no explanation. # Broken promises and rule violations: Occasions during which a partner fails to keep a promise, changes plans with no warning or explanation, or violates a rule that the offended person assumes was binding. # Deception, secrets and privacy: Instances in which a partner lied, kept important information a secret, failed to keep sensitive information private, or violated privacy boundaries. # Abuse: Verbal or physical threats. Cameron, Ross, and Holmes (2002) identified 10 categories of common relational negative behavior that constitute relational transgressions as rule violations:Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002, p.310 # Broken promises # Overreaction to the victim's behavior # Inconsiderate behavior # Violating the victim's desired level of intimacy # Neglecting the victim # Threat of infidelity # Infidelity # Verbal aggression toward the victim # Unwarranted disagreement # Violent behavior toward the victim Infidelity Infidelity is widely recognized as one of the most hurtful relational transgressions. Around 30% to 40% of dating relationships are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity. It is typically among the most difficult transgressions to forgive. There are typically four methods of discovery: # Finding out from a third party. # Witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as walking in on your partner with someone else. # Having the partner admit to infidelity after another partner questions. # Having the partner tell their partner on their own. Partners who found out through a third party or by witnessing the infidelity firsthand were the least likely to forgive. Partners who confessed on their own were the most likely to be forgiven. =Sexual vs. emotional infidelity= Sexual infidelity refers to sexual activity with someone other than a person's partner. Sexual infidelity can span a wide range of behavior and thoughts, including: sexual intercourse, heavy petting, passionate kissing, sexual fantasies, and sexual attraction. It can involve a sustained relationship, a one-night stand, or a prostitute. Most people in the United States openly disapprove of sexual infidelity, but research indicates that infidelity is common. Men are typically more likely than women to engage in a sexual affair, regardless if they are married or in a dating relationship. Emotional infidelity refers to emotional involvement with another person, which leads one's partner to channel emotional resources to someone else. Emotional infidelity can involve strong feelings of love and intimacy, nonsexual fantasies of falling in love, romantic attraction, or the desire to spend time with another individual. Emotional infidelity may involve a coworker, Internet partner, face-to-face communication, or a long distance phone call. Emotional infidelity is likely related to dissatisfaction with the communication and social support an individual is receiving in his or her current relationship. Each type of infidelity evokes different responses. Sexual infidelity is more likely to result in hostile, shocked, repulsed, humiliated, homicidal, or suicidal feelings. Emotional infidelity is more likely to evoke feelings of being undesirable, insecure, depressed, or abandoned. When both types of infidelity are present in a relationship, couples are more likely to break up than when only one type of infidelity is involved. =Gender differences in infidelity= While gender is not a reliable predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and emotional infidelity, there are nonetheless differences in how men and women on average react to sexual and emotional infidelity. Culturally Western men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive a partner's sexual infidelity than a partner's emotional infidelity. Western men are also more likely to break up in response to a partner's sexual infidelity than in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive a partner's emotional infidelity than a partner's sexual infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by evolutionary psychologists: over human evolution, a partner's sexual infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring. Therefore, a partner's sexual infidelity represents a potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women. As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to a partner's sexual infidelity. Whereas on average Western men are more acutely sensitive to sexual infidelity (supposedly driven by evolutionary requirements noted above), Western women are commonly believed to have greater sensitivity to emotional infidelity. This response in women is, by the arguments of the theory above, driven by the perception that emotional infidelity suggests a long-term diversion of a partner's commitment, and a potential loss of resources.Shackelford, Buss, and Bennett, 2002 Evolutionary psychology explains this difference by arguing that a woman's loss of male support would result in a diminished chance of survival for both the woman and her offspring. Consequently, relationship factors that are more associated with commitment and partner investment play a more critical role in the psyche of women in contrast to men.Cann and Baucom, 2004 When infidelity involves a former romantic partner, as opposed to a new partner, it is perceived to be more distressing ‚Äì especially for women. Both men and women overall view situations of sexual infidelity as more distressing than situations of emotional involvement. The typical man, however, viewed only the former partner scenario as more distressing with regard to sexual infidelity; men made no distinction for emotional infidelity. Women, however, view a former partner scenario as the most distressing option for both sexual and emotional infidelity. Men and women both judge infidels of the opposite gender as acting more intentionally than their own gender.Mongeau, Hale, and Alles, 1994 =Internet infidelity= Recent research provides support for conceptualizing infidelity on a continuum ranging in severity from superficial/informal behavior to involving or goal-directed behavior. This perspective accounts for the varying degrees of behavior (e.g., sexual, emotional) on the Internet. A number of acts not involving direct, one-to-one communication with another person (e.g. posting a personal ad or looking at pornography) can be perceived as forms of infidelity. Thus, communication with another live person is not necessary for infidelity to occur. Accordingly, Internet infidelity is defined by Docan-Morgan and Docan (2007) as follows: \\"An act or actions engaged via the internet by one person with a committed relationship, where such an act occurs outside the primary relationship, and constitutes a breach of trust and/or violation of agreed-upon norms (overt or covert) by one or both individuals in that relationship with regard to relational exclusivity, and is perceived as having a particular degree of severity by one or both partners.\\"Docan-Morgan and Docan, 2007, p.331 Jealousy =Characteristics of jealousy= Jealousy is the result of a relational transgression, such as a partner having a sexual or emotional affair. Jealousy can also be seen as a transgression in its own right, when a partner's suspicions are unfounded. Thus, jealousy is an important component of relational transgressions. There are several types of jealousy. Romantic jealousy occurs when a partner is concerned that a potential rival might interfere with his or her existing romantic relationship. Sexual jealousy is a specific form of romantic jealousy where an individual worries that a rival is having or wants to have sex with his or her partner. Other forms of jealousy include: *Friend jealousy ‚Äì feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with friends. *Family jealousy ‚Äì feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with family members. *Activity jealousy ‚Äì perceiving that a partner's activities, such as work, hobbies, or school, are interfering with one's relationship. *Power jealousy ‚Äì perceiving that one's influence over a partner is being lost to others. *Intimacy jealousy ‚Äì believing that one's partner in engaging in more intimate communication, such as disclosure and advice seeking, with someone else. Jealousy is different from envy and rivalry. Envy occurs when people want something valuable that someone else has. Rivalry occurs when two people are competing for something that neither person has. =Experiencing romantic jealousy= Individuals who are experiencing jealous thoughts typically make primary and secondary cognitive appraisals about their particular situation. Primary appraisals involve general evaluations about the existence and quality of a rival relationship. Secondary appraisals involve more specific evaluations about the jealous situation, including possible causes of the jealousy and potential outcomes to the situation. There are four common types of secondary appraisals: # Jealous people assess motives. # Jealous people compare themselves to their rival. # They evaluate their potential alternatives. # Finally, jealous people assess their potential loss. Jealous individuals make appraisals to develop coping strategies and assess potential outcomes. Jealous individuals normally experience combinations of emotions, in addition to the aforementioned cognitive appraisals. The most common emotions associated with jealousy are fear and anger; people are fearful of losing their relationship and they are often angry at their partner or rival. Other common negative emotions associated with jealousy are sadness, guilt, hurt, and envy. Sometimes, however, jealousy leads to positive emotions, including increased passion, love, and appreciation. Relational partners sometimes intentionally induce jealousy in their relationship. There are typically two types of goals for jealousy induction. Relational rewards reflect the desire to improve the relationship, increase self-esteem, and increase relational rewards. The second type of goal, relational revenge, reflects the desire to punish one's partner, the need for revenge, and the desire to control one's partner. The tactic of inducing jealousy may produce unintended consequences, as jealousy often leads to other relational transgressions including violence.Fleischmann, Spitzberg, Andersen, and Roesch, 2005 =Communicative responses to jealousy= Jealousy can involve a wide range of communicative responses. These responses are based upon the individuals' goals and emotions. The most common of these responses are negative affect expression, integrative communication, and distributive communication. When people want to maintain their relationship, they use integrative communication and compensatory restoration. People who are fearful of losing their relationships typically use compensatory restoration. Conversely, people who are concerned with maintaining their self-esteem allege that they deny jealous feelings. When individuals are motivated to reduce uncertainty about their partner, they use integrative communication, surveillance, and rival contacts to seek additional information. Communicative responses to jealousy may help reduce uncertainty and restore self-esteem, but they may actually increase uncertainty and negatively impact relationships and self-esteem in some instances. The type of communicative response used is critical. For example, avoidance/denial may be used to protect one's self-esteem, but it may also result in increased uncertainty and relational dissatisfaction, if the jealous partner is left with lingering suspicions. Similarly, compensatory restoration may improve the relationship in some instances, but it may also communicate low self-esteem and desperation by the jealous individual.Guerrero, Andersen, Jorgensen, Spitzberg, and Eloy, 1995 Distributive communication, which includes behaviors such as yelling and confrontation, may serve to vent negative emotion and retaliate by making the partner feel bad. This may exacerbate an already negative situation and make reconciliation less likely.Bachman and Guerrero, 2006 =Jealousy and relational satisfaction= Jealousy is generally considered to be a relationship dysfunction, though it may have some positive relational properties. These positive properties can be attained through development of one's ability to manage jealousy in a productive way, so that the jealous individual shows care and concern without seeming overly fearful, aggressive, or possessive. Negative affect expression can be effective if used in conjunction with integrative communication. Compensatory restoration can be effective, but when used in excess, too much can make an individual seem desperate and too eager to please, which can have detrimental effects on the relationships. =Rumination= From the aspect of jealousy, rumination reflects uncomfortable mulling about the security of a relationship. Rumination refers to thoughts that are conscious, recurring, and not demanded by the individual's current environment. Ruminative thoughts occur repetitively and are difficult to eliminate. In the context of relational threats, rumination can be described as obsessive worry about the security of the current relationship. Individuals who ruminate are very likely to respond to jealousy differently from individuals who do not ruminate. Rumination is positively associated with several communicative responses to jealousy (e.g. compensatory restoration, negative affect expression, showing signs of possession, and derogation of competitors) that attempt to strengthen a relationship. Rumination is also associated with responses that are counterproductive. Despite efforts to restore relational intimacy, rumination sustains uncertainty, which thereby forms a cycle where rumination is sustained. Rumination intensifies over time and serves as a constant reminder to the threat to the relationship, resulting in increased negative affect. This negative affect is associated with destructive responses to jealousy including violent communication and violence towards objects. Finally, jealous rumination is associated with relational distress and counterproductive responses to jealousy.Carson and Cupach, 2000 =Sex differences in jealous emotions and communication= Women generally experience more hurt, sadness, anxiety, and confusion than men, perhaps because they often blame themselves for the jealous situation. Conversely, men have been found to deny jealous feelings and focus on increasing their self-esteem. Generally speaking, women tend to be more focused on the relationship, while men tend to be more focused on individual concerns. In communicative responses, women tend to use integrative communication, express negative affect, enhance their appearance, and use counterjealousy induction more often than jealous men. Jealous men more often contact the rival, restrict the partner's access to potential rivals, and give gifts and spend money on the partner. Jealous men also engage in dangerous behaviors, such as getting drunk and engaging in promiscuous sex with others. Analysis from an evolutionary perspective would suggest that men focus on competing for mates and displaying resources (e.g., material goods to suggest financial security), while women focus on creating and enhancing social bonds and showcasing their beauty. Deception Deception is a major relational transgression that often leads to feelings of betrayal and distrust between relational partners. Deception violates relational rules and is considered to be a negative violation of expectations. Most people expect friends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the time. If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and communicating with others would simply be unproductive and too difficult. On a given day, it is likely that most human beings will either deceive or be deceived by another person. A significant amount of deception occurs between romantic and relational partners. =Types= Deception includes several types of communications or omissions that serve to distort or omit the complete truth. Deception itself is intentionally managing verbal and/or nonverbal messages so that the message receiver will believe in a way that the message sender knows is false. Intent is critical with regard to deception. Intent differentiates between deception and an honest mistake. The Interpersonal Deception Theory explores the interrelation between communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges. Five primary forms of deception consist of the following: * Lies: Making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth. * Equivocations: Making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement. * Concealments: Omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information. * Exaggeration: Overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree. * Understatement: Minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth. =Motives= There are three primary motivations for deceptions in close relationships. *Partner-focused motives: Using deception to avoid hurting the partner, helping the partner to enhance or maintain his or her self-esteem, avoid worrying the partner, and protecting the partner's relationship with a third party. Partner-motivated deception can sometimes be viewed as socially polite and relationally beneficial. *Self-focused motives: Using deception to enhance or protect their self-image, wanting to shield themselves from anger, embarrassment, or criticism. Self-focused deception is generally perceived as a more serious transgression than partner-focused deception because the deceiver is acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of the relationship. *Relationship-focused motives: Using deception to limit relationship harm by avoiding conflict or relational trauma. Relationally motivated deception can be beneficial to a relationship, and other times it can be harmful by further complicating matters. =Detection= Deception detection between relational partners is extremely difficult, unless a partner tells a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other partner knows to be true. While it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners. Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception. Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver. He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable. As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally. Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange. The Interpersonal Deception Theory posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message.Buller & Burgoon, 1996 A deceiver's actions are interrelated to the message receiver's actions. It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit.Burgoon & Qin, 2006 Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators. Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception.Vrij, 2008 As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist. There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception. Vrij found that examining a \\"cluster\\" of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue. In terms of perceptions about the significance of deceiving a partner, women and men typically differ in their beliefs about deception. Women view deception as a much more profound relational transgression than men. Additionally, women rate lying in general as a less acceptable behavior than men. Finally, women are much more likely to view any act of lying as significant (regardless of the subject matter) and more likely to report negative emotional reactions to lying. Truth bias The truth bias significantly impairs the ability of relational partners to detect deception. In terms of deception, a truth bias reflects a tendency to judge more messages as truths than lies, independent of their actual veracity.Burgoon, Blair, and Strom, 2008 When judging message veracity, the truth bias contributes to an overestimate of the actual number of truths relative to the base rate of actual truths. The truth bias is especially strong within close relationships. People are highly inclined to trust the communications of others and are unlikely to question the relational partner unless faced with a major deviation of behavior that forces a reevaluation. When attempting to detect deceit from a familiar person or relational partner, a large amount of information about the partner is brought to mind. This information essentially overwhelms the receiver's cognitive ability to detect and process any cues to deception. It is somewhat easier to detect deception in strangers, when less information about that person is brought to mind.Millar and Millar, 1995 Hurtful messages Messages that convey negative feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages are associated with less satisfying relationships. Intentionally hurtful messages are among the most serious, as perceived by a partner. Unlike physical pain that usually subsides over time, hurtful messages and hurt feelings often persist for a long period of time and be recalled even years after the event. The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent.Leary, Springer, Negel, Ansell, and Evans, 1998 People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner said something to deliberately hurt them. Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements. Feeling devalued is a central component of hurtful messages. Similar to verbally aggressive messages, hurtful messages that are stated intensely may be viewed as particularly detrimental. The clich√© \\"It's not what you say, but how you say it\\" is very applicable with regard to recipients' appraisals of hurtful messages.Young, 2004 Females tend to experience more hurt than males in response to hurtful messages.Fine and Olson, 1997 Forgiveness Conceptualizing forgiveness Individuals tend to experience a wide array of complex emotions following a relational transgression. These emotions are shown to have utility as an initial coping mechanism.Metts, S., & Cupach, W., 2007 For example, fear can result in a protective orientation following a serious transgression;Izard & Ackerman, 2000 sadness results in contemplation and reflection Barr-Zisowitz, 2000 while disgust causes us to repel from its source.Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000 However, beyond the initial situation these emotions can be detrimental to one's mental and physical state.Baumeister, Exline, & Sommer, 1998 Consequently, forgiveness is viewed as a more productive means of dealing with the transgression along with engaging the one who committed the transgression. Forgiving is not the act of excusing or condoning. Rather, it is the process whereby negative emotions are transformed into positive emotions for the purpose of bringing emotional normalcy to a relationship. In order to achieve this transformation the offended must forgo retribution and claims for retribution.Boon & Sulsky, 1997 McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal (1997) defined forgiveness as a, ‚Äúset of motivational changes whereby one becomes (a) decreasingly motivated to retaliate against an offending relationship partner, (b) decreasingly motivated to maintain estrangement from the offender, and (c) increasingly motivated by conciliation and goodwill for the offender, despite the offender‚Äôs hurtful actions‚Äù.McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal, 1997, p.323 In essence, relational partners choose constructive behaviors that show an emotional commitment and willingness to sacrifice in order to achieve a state of forgiveness. Dimensions of forgiveness The link between reconciliation and forgiveness involves exploring two dimensions of forgiveness: intrapsychic and interpersonal. The intrapsychic dimension relates to the cognitive processes and interpretations associated with a transgression (i.e. internal state), whereas interpersonal forgiveness is the interaction between relational partners. Total forgiveness is defined as including both the intrapsychic and interpersonal components which brings about a return to the conditions prior to the transgression.Baumeister et al., 1998 To only change one's internal state is silent forgiveness, and only having interpersonal interaction is considered hollow forgiveness. However, some scholars contend that these two dimensions (intrapsychic and interpersonal) are independent as the complexities associated with forgiveness involve gradations of both dimensions.Fincham, 2000; Worthington, 1998 For example, a partner may not relinquish negative emotions yet choose to remain in the relationship because of other factors (e.g., children, financial concerns, etc.). Conversely, one may grant forgiveness and release all negative emotions directed toward their partner, and still exit the relationship because trust cannot be restored. Given this complexity, research has explored whether the transformation of negative emotions to positive emotions eliminates negative affect associated with a given offense. The conclusions drawn from this research suggest that no correlation exists between forgiveness and unforgiveness.Witvleit, Ludwig, and Vander Lann, 2001; Wade and Worthington, 2003; Konstam, Holmes, and Levine, 2003 Put simply, while forgiveness may be granted for a given transgression, the negative affect may not be reduced a corresponding amount. Determinants of forgiveness Predictors of forgiveness McCullough et al. (1998) outlined predictors of forgiveness into four broad categories McCullough et al., 1998; Metts and Cupach, 2007 *Personality traits of both partners *Relationship quality *Nature of the transgression *Social-cognitive variables While personality variables and characteristics of the relationship are preexisting to the occurrence of forgiveness, nature of the offense and social-cognitive determinants become apparent at the time of the transgression. =Personality traits of both partners= Forgivingness is defined as one's general tendency to forgive transgressions.Roberts, 1995 However, this tendency differs from forgiveness which is a response associated with a specific transgression. Listed below are characteristics of the forgiving personality as described by Emmons (2000).Emmons, 2000 *Does not seek revenge; effectively regulates negative affect *Strong desire for a relationship free of conflict *Shows empathy toward offender *Does not personalize hurt associated with transgression In terms of personality traits, agreeableness and neuroticism (i.e., instability, anxiousness, aggression) show consistency in predicting forgivingness and forgiveness.Ashton, Paunonen, Helmes, & Jackson, 1998; Berry et al., 2001; Berry, Worthington, O‚ÄôConnor, Parrott, & Wade, 2005; Exline, Baumeister, Bushman, Campbell, & Finkel, 2004; Hoyt et al., 2005 Since forgiveness requires one to discard any desire for revenge, a vengeful personality tends to not offer forgiveness and may continue to harbor feelings of vengeance long after the transgression occurred.Thompson et al., 2005; McCullough et al., 2001 Research has shown that agreeableness is inversely correlated with motivations for revenge and avoidance, as well as positively correlated with benevolence. As such, one who demonstrates the personality trait of agreeableness is prone to forgiveness as well as has a general disposition of forgivingness. Conversely, neuroticism was positively correlated with avoidance and vengefulness, but negatively correlated with benevolence. Consequently, a neurotic personality is less apt to forgive or to have a disposition of forgivingness. Though the personality traits of the offended have a predictive value of forgiveness, the personality of the offender also has an effect on whether forgiveness is offered. Offenders who show sincerity when seeking forgiveness and are persuasive in downplaying the impact of the transgression will have a positive effect on whether the offended will offer forgiveness.Hoyt et al., 2005; Wolf-Smith & LaRossa, 1992; Metts and Cupach, 2007 Narcissistic personalities, for example, may be categorized as persuasive transgressors. This is driven by the narcissist to downplay their transgressions, seeing themselves as perfect and seeking to save face at all costs.Exline et al, 2004 Such a dynamic suggests that personality determinants of forgiveness may involve not only the personality of the offended, but also that of the offender. =Relationship quality= The quality of a relationship between offended and offending partners can affect whether forgiveness is both sought and given. In essence, the more invested one is in a relationship, the more prone they are to minimize the hurt associated with transgressions and seek reconciliation. McCullough et al. (1998) provides seven reasons behind why those in relationships will seek to forgive:McCullough et al., 2007 # High investment in relationship (e.g., children, joint finances, etc.) # Views relationship as long term commitment # Have high degree of common interests # Is selfless in regard to their partner # Willingness to take viewpoint of partner (i.e. empathy) # Assumes motives of partner are in best interest of relationship (e.g., criticism is taken as constructive feedback) # Willingness to apologize for transgressions Relationship maintenance activities are a critical component to maintaining high quality relationships. While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one may be in a skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted. This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and will not be as prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors. As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.Fincham et al., 2002 Another relationship factor that affects forgiveness is history of past conflict. If past conflicts ended badly (i.e., reconciliation/forgiveness was either not achieved or achieved after much conflict), partners will be less prone to seek out or offer forgiveness.Hoyt et al., 2005 As noted earlier, maintaining a balanced relationship (i.e. no partner over/under benefitted) has a positive effect on relationship quality and tendency to forgive. In that same vein, partners are more likely to offer forgiveness if their partners had recently forgiven them for a transgression.Metts, Morse et al., 2001 However, if a transgression is repeated resentment begins to build which has an adverse effect on the offended partner's desire to offer forgiveness. =Nature of the transgression= The most notable feature of a transgression to have an effect on forgiveness is the seriousness of the offense. Some transgressions are perceived as being so serious that they are considered unforgivable.Younger et al., 2004 To counter the negative affect associated with a severe transgression, the offender may engage in repair strategies to lessen the perceived hurt of the transgression. The offender's communication immediately following a transgression has the greatest predictive value on whether forgiveness will be granted.Kelly, 1998 Consequently, offenders who immediately apologize, take responsibility and show remorse have the greatest chance of obtaining forgiveness from their partner.McCullough et al., 1998 Further, self-disclosure of a transgression yields much greater results than if a partner is informed of the transgression through a third party. By taking responsibility for one's actions and being forthright through self-disclosure of an offense, partners may actually form closer bonds from the reconciliation associated with a serious transgression. As noted in the section on personality, repeated transgressions cause these relationship repair strategies to have a more muted effect as resentment begins to build and trust erodes. = Social-cognitive variables = Attributions of responsibility for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness. Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner is less likely to feel empathy and forgive. Based on the notion that forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner. The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel as a result of the transgression. In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.McCullough et al, 1997 Remedial strategies for the offender Prior sections offered definitions of forgiveness along with determinants of forgiveness from the perspective of the partner who has experienced the hurtful transgression. As noted earlier, swift apologies and utilization of repair strategies by the offender have the greatest likelihood of eliciting empathy from the offended and ultimately receiving forgiveness for the transgression. The sections below address remedial strategies offenders may use to facilitate a state in which the offended more likely to offer forgiveness and seek to normalize the relationship. =Apologies/concessions= Most common of the remedial strategies, an apology is the most straightforward means by which to admit responsibility, express regret, and seek forgiveness. Noted earlier, apologies are most effective if provided in a timely manner and involve a self- disclosure. Apologies occurring after discovery of a transgression by a third party are much less effective. Though apologies can range from a simple, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù to more elaborate forms, offenders are most successful when offering more complex apologies to match the seriousness of the transgression.Darby & Schlenker, 1982, 1989 =Excuses/justifications= Rather than accepting responsibility for a transgression through the form of an apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor's inability to control their actions (e.g., ‚ÄúHow would I have known my ex-girlfriend was going to be at the party.‚Äù) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., ‚ÄúI went to lunch with my ex-girlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.‚Äù) Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., ‚ÄúWe are just friends.‚Äù) =Refusals= Refusals are where a transgressor claims no blame for the perceived transgression. This is a departure from apologies and excuses/justifications which involve varying degrees of blame acceptance. In the case of a refusal, the transgressor believes that they have not done anything wrong. Such a situation points out the complexity of relational transgressions. Perception of both partners must be taken into account when recognizing and addressing transgressions. For example, Bob and Sally have just started to date, but have not addressed whether they are mutually exclusive. When Bob finds out that Sally has been on a date with someone else, he confronts Sally. Sally may engage in refusal of blame because Bob and Sally had not explicitly noted whether they were mutually exclusive. The problem with these situations is that the transgressor shows no sensitivity to the offended. As such, the offended is less apt to exhibit empathy which is key towards forgiveness. As such, research has shown that refusals tend to aggravate situations, rather than serve as a meaningful repair strategy.Mongeau et al., 1994 =Appeasement/positivity= Appeasement is used to offset hurtful behavior through the transgressor ingratiating themselves in ways such as promising never to commit the hurtful act or being overly kind to their partner. Appeasement may elicit greater empathy from the offended, through soothing strategies exhibited by the transgressor (e.g., complimenting, being more attentive, spending greater time together). However, the danger of appeasement is the risk that the actions of transgressor will be viewed as being artificial. For example, sending your partner flowers every day resulting from an infidelity you have committed, may be viewed as downplaying the severity of the transgression if the sending of flowers is not coupled with other soothing strategies that cause greater immediacy. =Avoidance/evasion= Avoidance involves the transgressor making conscious efforts to ignore the transgression (also referred to as ‚Äúsilence‚Äù). Avoidance can be effective after an apology is sought and forgiveness is granted (i.e., minimizing discussion around unpleasant subjects once closure has been obtained). However, total avoidance of a transgression where the hurt of the offended is not recognized and forgiveness is not granted can result in further problems in the future. As relational transgressions tend to develop the nature of the relationship through drawing of new rules/boundaries, avoidance of a transgression does not allow for this development. Not surprisingly, avoidance is ineffective as a repair strategy, particularly for instances in which infidelity has occurred. =Relationship talk= Relationship talk is a remediation strategy that focuses on discussing the transgression in the context of the relationship. Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk.Aune et al., 1998 Relationship invocation involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression. For example, ‚ÄúWe are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.‚Äù, or ‚ÄúOur relationship is so much better than any of my previous relationships.‚Äù Metatalk involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship. For example, infidelity may cause partners to redefine rules of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.

While at AMD, he provided the Cuban government with technical information from the semiconductor industry which the Cubans passed on to the Soviet bloc, primarily to the Soviet Union and East Germany. In 1992, Gaede turned himself over to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which placed him in contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI began working with Gaede in a counter-espionage operation intended to penetrate Cuban intelligence using his contacts on the island. During this time Gaede obtained work at Intel Corp. in Chandler, Arizona. Intel Security discovered the nature of his activities at AMD and terminated him, but not before Gaede filmed Intel's state-of-the-art Pentium process from home. Gaede fled with this technology to South America where he allegedly sold the information to Chinese and Iranian representatives. Upon his return to the United States, Gaede was arrested, prosecuted, and convicted. He was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996, after which he was deported. The 9th Circuit Court rejected Gaede's appeal, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Gaede later wrote a critique of mathematical physics and the usage of the scientific method in the disciplines of physics, biology, anthropology and palaeontology according to his own interpretations. Gaede's theories have mainly been proliferated via the Internet. Gaede has one son by the name of Eric Gaede, most commonly known by his YouTube name Asalieri, who is known for his ‚ÄúReviewing a Reviewer‚Äù videos where he critiques the reviewing style of other critics.  Early years  Gaede was born in Lan√∫s, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, the third of four siblings of Gunther and Wiera Gaede. The Gaedes migrated to Rockford, Illinois, in 1959, but returned to Argentina in 1965 disillusioned with their experience in the United States. Although from a Peronist background, Gaede joined the Communist Party of Argentina at the age of 21 while serving as a steward of FOETRA, the union of the state-owned telephone company ENTel. After his application for a Cuban resident visa was turned down, he re-entered the United States in 1977, this time as a tourist. In the U.S., Gaede worked under the alias Ricardo Monares at Caron International in Rochelle, Ill.  Working at AMD and connection with Cuba  Gaede moved to California and started working at AMD in Sunnyvale in September 1979. By 1982, he had worked his way up the ranks to become a process engineer. Still faithful to his socialistic principles, Gaede began to gather technical information from AMD, which he offered to the Cubans in one of his trips to Buenos Aires. In 1986, Gaede was transferred to AMD's plant in Austin, Texas. This move enabled Gaede to take material in the trunk of his car and deliver the technology to Cuban agents on the Mexican side of the border. Gaede was so successful in this clandestine operation that Fidel Castro arranged to meet him in person in Havana at the end of 1988. Gaede eventually traveled in 1990, but by then had become disenchanted with communism. The entire Soviet bloc had disintegrated during 1989.  CIA and FBI involvement  At the urging of renegade Cuban agents, Gaede turned himself over to the CIA on July 13, 1992. The FBI interrogated Gaede in September 1992 and began to use him in a counter-intelligence operation against Cuba. The FBI admitted reimbursing Gaede $607.16 for \\"expenses incurred in connection with a counterintelligence matter.\\" Apparently, the plan consisted of taking advantage of Gaede's intelligence contacts on the island. Gaede and Intel While under FBI supervision, Gaede obtained a job as a programmer at the Intel chip plant in Chandler, Arizona. The FBI alleges that it alerted Intel of Gaede's background. Intel flatly denies the allegation, stating that had the company known of Gaede's background, \\"It is safe to say that Gaede would not have been hired.\\" Intel terminated Gaede's employment in June 1994. However, before Gaede was fired, he managed to film the entire Pentium process database from his home, ironically, using a terminal provided by Intel. He placed a camera and filmed the specs as they rolled on the screen. Shortly after, Gaede fled to South America and began to peddle the technology through the embassies of China and Iran. He allegedly counseled and trained Chinese and Iranian engineers in American manufacturing processes. Gaede was arrested by Argentine authorities as he attempted to bury tapes and documents, and was subsequently interrogated by the Secretar√≠a de Inteligencia (SIDE) and the CIA in Buenos Aires. Intel security manager Steve Lund arranged to meet Gaede in Argentina at the Sheraton Hotel on May 14, 1995. During their meeting, Gaede admitted to Lund to having stolen AMD material and equipment and giving it to the Cubans. He also admitted taking Intel's Pentium process and providing it to foreign countries. Intel alleged, further, that Gaede sent a video of the Pentium technology he copied to rival AMD. As a result of these acts, Intel filed a civil complaint against Gaede in Argentina and criminal charges in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California. Gaede denied the charge of sending tapes to AMD and accused the CIA of framing him.  Return to the United States, arrest, conviction and deportation  Gaede returned to the United States in June 1995 and was arrested by the FBI on September 23. He represented himself in court and changed his plea after reaching an agreement with federal prosecutors. The agreement included a clause advising against deportation in spite of the fact that Gaede was known to be in the country illegally. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) proceeded to process Gaede for removal despite the recommendation. Initially, Gaede prevailed in his deportation case, but the government appealed. The case was remanded, and Gaede was subsequently deported.  The Industrial Espionage Act of 1996  During Gaede's prosecution, AMD, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney, and all affected parties, complained that there were no laws to prosecute cases such as his. Shortly after Gaede's plea, the United States Congress enacted the Industrial Espionage Act of 1996, legislation that would soon be used to prosecute activities of the type Gaede was involved in.  Charges against him  # National Stolen Property Act ‚Äì US Code Title 18 Section 2314 # Mail Fraud ‚Äì US Code Title 18 Section 1341 Accusations against Jos√© Cohen Vald√©s and the Cuban government Gaede created some controversy in the Cuban exile community in July 2009 by publicly accusing Miami businessman and ex-DGI (Cuban Intelligence Directorate) Captain Jos√© (Pepe) Cohen Vald√©s of working under the supervision of the Cuban government while on the island. Gaede claims that the American intelligence agencies never recruited Cohen because they did not believe Cohen to be credible. Gaede further accuses Cohen of deliberately misinforming the American intelligence agencies by channeling false information through him to the CIA and of betraying both him and their comrade in arms, Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, sentenced to 25 years in prison for espionage in Cuba after Cohen's defection. Gaede accuses the Cuban government of masterminding a counter-espionage operation against the U.S. that revolved around Cohen and his commander, Major Onelio Beovides. Cohen denies the charges.  Critique of mathematical physics  In 1997, Gaede developed a critique of mathematical physics which was centred upon the semantic issues of the popular presentations of general relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory. On February 20, 1998, Gaede completed his critique in book form, along with a theory of light, magnetism and gravity developed as a recreated model of physics in light of his deconstruction of the old models. His model is known as the rope hypothesis. This book remained unpublished until 2008, under the title Why God Doesn't Exist, with his major contention being that mathematical physics constitutes a religion and also a possible premise for arguments relating to the existence of God. The vast array of his arguments revolve around the fallacy of reification, or misplaced concreteness. Gaede explains that all theories of mathematical physics use abstract concepts as physical objects acting in reality. \\"Forces\\", \\"waves\\", \\"points\\", \\"fields\\", and so on, are not physical, but conceptual, according to Gaede.  El Crazy Che  A documentary titled El Crazy Che was released at the Buenos Aires International Festival on April 17, 2015. This biographical movie narrates Gaede's spying activities in favor of Cuba, Iran and China. (Spanish) Gaede says he turned Rolando Sarraff Trujillo over to the Cuban authorities in 1994 by mailing a letter to the Cuban Intelligence Directorate. According to Gaede, Sarraff Trujillo had no bearing on the identification of Ana Montes. The United States exchanged the remaining members of the Cuban Five for Sarraff Trujillo during the Cuban Thaw because the Government regarded Alan Gross to be a hostage. El Crazy Che was available on Netflix as of October 15, 2017.https://www.netflix.com/title/80192924  References   Further reading   1952 births American spies Argentine spies Chinese spies Cuban spies Iranian spies Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations Living people Criticism of science People from Lan√∫s ","title":"Bill Gaede"},{"id":"25090564","text":"The Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant.

The Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant is the only one of its kind known to definitely have been made in England. Astrolabes are calculation instruments that enable their users to tell the time and determine their geographical latitude using the position of the sun and stars.

Taenia taeniaeformis is a parasitic tapeworm, with cats as the primary definitive hosts. Sometime dogs can also be the definitive host. The intermediate hosts of this tapeworm are primarily rodents and less frequently lagomorphs (rabbits) which the cat must kill and ingest their liver in order to acquire the tapeworm infection. The worm tends to be white, thick bodied, and around 15 to 60 cm in length. This species of tape worm is much less frequently encountered than Dipylidium caninum, which has fleas as its intermediate host rather than rodents but exhibits most of the same physical characteristics and is treated with the same medications (i.e., antihelminthics). Life cycle The definitive host must ingest the strobilocercus stage of the tapeworm in order to acquire the parasite. The strobilocercus is a larval stage that has a terminal bladder and a rather long segmented body that is in crowned with the scolex that looks very similar to that found on the adult form. It seems that the strobilocercus must attain an age of about 2 months before it is in infective to a cat upon ingestion. Once a cat ingests the strobilocercus, the posterior portion of the larva is in digested away and then the anterior portion begins to develop. Infection in the cat will develop and become obvious between 30 and 80 days after the cat has ingested the infected liver of a prey animal. Once the infection is established, it can last for between seven months and three years. A cat will produce between three and four motile segments per day either excreted in the feces or through direct migration, each containing between 500 and 12,000 eggs. Spontaneous worm destrobilization (the shedding of the entire portion of the body located behind the scolex and containing all of the strobila) may occur without any change in actual infection. Once shed, the proglotids are often very active and are capable of crawling considerable distances as they shed their eggs. Actual eggs are spheroid and are between 31 and 36 micrometers in diameter. Superinfection in cats is possible if they are fed young tapeworms in the presence of established mature ones. Diagnosis Infection in cats is in diagnosed by finding the distinctive segments in the feces or by finding the eggs upon fecal flotation. You may also see small segments lying around where the animal has been that have exited through the anus. To identify a segment, it can be crushed on a glass slide and examined for eggs. Treatment Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and epsiprantel have both been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and fenbendazole are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and nitroscanate are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.

He was among the early aviation company owners in Norway, and later became known as a photographer in Wider√∏e from 1934 to 1975, except for four years during World War II when he was imprisoned in concentration camps for resistance work. He pioneered the use of aerophotogrammetry in Norway. Pre-war life He was born in Ringsaker as a son of banker Halvdan Skappel and Dagny Sommerfelt Skappel. He took a pilot's education from 1929 to 1930 under the Norwegian Army at Kjeller. Skappel soon became involved in the pioneer days of aviation in Norway. He owned the company Lotsberg & Skappel, along with Leiv Brun, Ditlef Smith and Erik Engn√¶s. The company operated a Gipsy Moth airplane. It was used for private flights, taxi flights and air shows, the latter in cooperation with the company Wider√∏e & Bj√∏rneby as well as Norsk Aero Klubb.Arnesen, 1984: pp. 8‚Äì9 Wider√∏e & Bj√∏rneby became Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap in February 1934, after Viggo Wider√∏e had bought and flown a Waco Cabin from the United States. In the Easter of 1934, a meeting was held at Ustaoset in which Skappel was recruited to Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap--his company would become incorporated into Wider√∏e's, and the co-owners be involved as well. Skappel was to lead the aerial school as well as a department for aerial photography. Incidentally, the Standard Moth plane owned by Skappel crashed shortly after, leading him to believe that he had lost his \\"entrance ticket\\" to Wider√∏e's, but he still became director of photography in the company.Arnesen, 1984: pp. 10‚Äì11 From 1935 he pioneered the use of aerophotogrammetry. Among others, the company had a contract with the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority (then known as Norges Geografiske Oppm√•ling).Arnesen, 1984: p. 55 World War II During World War II, Norway was invaded by Germany on 9 April 1940. Helge Skappel's brother died in the Battle of Stryken already on 12 April. Skappel joined the resistance movement, helping Norwegians to flee the country. He also transmitted information about German troop movements via illegal radio. He was arrested for conducting \\"intelligence\\" in June 1941, and was imprisoned at M√∏llergata 19 for a month. He was sentenced to six years of prison. He was transferred to Grini concentration camp in July 1941, as #353 of almost 20,000 prisoners. Viggo Wider√∏e was imprisoned as well, and they spent prison time in √Ökebergveien from October to November 1941, before being shipped to Germany via Akershus Fortress. He was imprisoned at Hamburg-F√ºhlsbuttel, and remained so until being saved by the White Buses at the war's end. His brother Vilhelm Skappel (1911‚Äì1992) was also a part of the resistance movement, but he fled to England in 1943. Like Helge he worked with aerial photography, having started as early as 1930.Arnesen, 1984: p. 61 After the war, Vilhelm Skappel chaired Commission VII of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing for ten years. Post-war life Skappel continued in Wider√∏e after the war. In 1946 he released the book Pionertid, \\"Pioneer Time\\", together with Viggo Wider√∏e, chronicling their time as pioneers of aviation in Norway. In 1951-1952 he was a member of an aerial expedition to Antarctica, as a part of the larger Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition. The small mountain Skappelnabben was discovered and named after him. In 1953 he made an advance to launch a program for economic mapping. This was his second advance; a proposal in 1937 led to some work being done by a committee, but it was hampered by World War II. Skappel's second advance led to a committee being formed in 1957, and economic mapping was eventually started by Norges Geografiske Oppm√•ling, however as late as in 1964. Skappel retired from the professional life in 1975. Skappel was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945 and the HM The King's Medal of Merit, and was an honorary member of the national cartographic society.

With the Great Depression weighing on the economy, in 1932 he added a second state position when he assumed a role with Illinois State Emergency Relief Commission. Government service Myers left Illinois in 1933 to join FDR's New Deal. According to Dr. Myer's obituary in the New York Times, his appointment was unusual because of his free market ideals. \\"Through the years he held firm to the belief that 'government controls over the economy are undesirable except in periods of sudden and grave emergency.' Sound budgetary policy...was far more effective than Government controls over prices, production, wages and profits.\\" His first posting was as assistant director in charge of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. He was next assistant director in charge of social research at the Works Progress Administration. In 1942, with World War II raging, Myers served as assistant chief of the Works Progress Administrations' munitions branch. Post- government work In 1943, Myers became affiliated with the Committee for Economic Development (CED). The CED is a private non-profit group of business and economic leaders encouraging policies that promote economic growth. In 1949, after six years as an associate director, he became the director of research. During his time as director, the CED helped American industry convert from its wartime footing to help meet the demands of the post-war economic boom. Myers was a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a member of the American Economic Association and the American Industrial Labor Relations Association. In March 1955, Myers died at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

Hogan and starring John Barrymore and John Howard. The film is based on Herman C. McNeile's novel The Third Round. Plot The intended wedding of Captain Hugh \\"Bulldog\\" Drummond (John Howard) to Phyllis Clavering (Louise Campbell) at her villa in Switzerland is stopped short (once again) when someone murders the Swiss policeman who is guarding their wedding presents. The killer makes off with their prize possession, a synthetic diamond, made by a secret process by Professor Bernard Goodman (Halliwell Hobbes), the father of their good friend Gwen Longworth (Nydia Westman). A guest, Sir Raymond Blantyre (Matthew Boulton), head of the Metropolitan Diamond Syndicate, disappears at the same time, and Drummond suspects that Sir Raymond, who has the most to lose if Professor Goodman proceeds with his plans to publish his secret process, has something to do with the theft. He leaves Phyllis and chases back to England. Colonel Nielsen (John Barrymore), of Scotland Yard, as usual scoffs at Drummond's suspicions and insists that a man as respected as Sir Raymond could not possibly be involved in such a crime. An explosion that wrecks Goodman's house, and apparently kills him, makes Drummond more positive that the diamond king has again resorted to murder to protect his business. He follows Professor Botulian (Porter Hall), a lifelong rival of Goodman's, whom he believes to be involved in the affair. His hunt leads him to a lonely house on the outskirts of London where he finds Goodman a prisoner. Drummond's valet Tenny (E.E. Clive) soon joins them as captive, but brings with him the means of escape. After Goodman is taken to safety, Drummond discovers that Phyllis, who was searching for him, is now being held by the crooks. Drummond quickly returns to the house to confront Sir Raymond and his armed confederates. Drummond begins to fight his way out, but is met by superior forces.

Plot  The movie begins with Nia (Parsons), an upwardly mobile biracial woman working for an advertising firm in New York City. When Nia and her co-worker at the firm, Matt (Thal) are put in charge of marketing a malt- liquor beverage to African-American teens, Nia quits her job. She decides to pursue her dream of writing a novel. She hopes to write about her Jewish father and African American mother meeting and living in Greenwich Village in the 1960s. In doing research and beginning her novel, Nia goes on an unexpected journey into her personal identity. Though her circle of friends is of all races, she has spent most of her life identifying with the Jewish side of her culture, and is a self-proclaimed yuppie. She hopes to identify more with the African-American side of her heritage, and find an authentic black experience. Her first attempt at this is in enrolling in an African-American writing workshop. In this class she meets and falls for the instructor, Lewis (Washington). At the same time, she goes out with her former co-Worker Matt for drinks, and finds that he has had a long time attraction to her as well. Nia pursues both of these relationships, with each man exploring a different side of her identity. She begins to learn that the two sides of her identity clash, and that she can't even be \\"too much\\" of either race. She is at times too white for Lewis, who comments that maybe he should find a \\"real black woman\\", and leave Nia. She also at times feels out of place with Matt, feeling she does not fit in with his friends, and in some instances even feels isolated by their opinions and racial remarks. Everything comes to a head when Nia invites both men to a wedding in which she is a bridesmaid. She is forced to make a decision between the two, but ultimately decides on being alone. She returns home, hoping to speak with her downstairs neighbor Joe (Serrano), a musician. During the whole movie she has had a fleeting flirty relationship with him, free of discussion of her race, and more about finding who she is as a person. She looks for him as her last person to turn to, but finds that he is gone, and has subleased his apartment for 6 months. Joe left a gift for her, a guitar, which inspires her to continue her novel, which she had given up on. The movie ends with Nia, now reading a poem to the same audience that at one time she had been \\"too white\\" for, and Joe clapping for her in the audience.

Perrot was received with great honor as an envoy from the French governor. Tetinchoua sent out a detachment to meet him, which, after performing some remarkable military evolutions, escorted Perrot and his Pottawattamie guard into the principal town of the Miamis. Tetinchoua then assigned him a guard of fifty men, and ordered a game of ball to be played for his diversion. He was unable, owing to his age and infirmities, to accompany Perrot to Sault Ste. Marie, at the mouth of Lake Superior, where the French took formal possession of all the country on the lakes.

Biography Early years LeGore was born in Frederick County, Maryland. He was a son of the James William LeGore. His father founded the LeGore Lime Company in 1861 and built the LeGore Bridge near Woodsboro, Maryland. LeGore attended the Tome School, Mercersburg Academy and Lafayette College. Yale LeGore enrolled at Yale University where he played for the school's football, baseball and basketball teams and was a member of Skull and Bones. In football, LeGore played halfback and fullback. He also handled punting duties and reportedly had a 65-yard average. American sports writer Grantland Rice once wrote that he wouldn't trade LeGore for Red Grange and added: \\"Harry never played a poor game in his life. He was always a competitor first, last and always ‚Äî and always had a little more when the chips were down.\\" In 1914, LeGore was the starting fullback for a Yale football team that compiled a 7-2 record and defeated Notre Dame 28-0, ending Notre Dame's 27-game win streak. Knute Rockne later wrote in his autobiography: \\"I sat on the sideline at New Haven that Saturday and saw a good Yale team captained by Bud Talbott with a crack halfback named Harry LeGore leading the attack. They made Notre Dame look like a high school squad.\\" At the end of the 1914 season, LeGore was selected as a first-team All-American by International News Service sports editor Frank G. Menke, and as a second-team All-American by Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly and Walter Eckersall, of the Chicago Tribune. LeGore also played shortstop for the Yale baseball team. In 1915, LeGore was ruled permanently ineligible to complete in college athletics after it was found that his food and lodging had been paid while playing summer baseball. In 1916, LeGore's eligibility was restored. The Yale football team in 1915 had won only four games without LeGore in the lineup. With LeGore back in the lineup, the 1916 team went 8-1. A syndicated newspaper story about LeGore's return to Yale stated: > Harry Legore is the real shining light of the Eli football team, there isn't > any doubt about that. Legore is the star, with a big 'S.' A couple of years > ago Legore made a name for himself as an end runner and was the man who > struck more terror to the hearts of 'Old Eli's opponents than any other man > on the team. In the summer Legore played baseball, and someone said it was > professional baseball with the result that Legore was barred from football > as a 'professional.' Quite a sensation was created, but this year Legore was > restored and it has been a mighty good thing for Yale that he was. And with > his restoration to eligibility as an amateur athlete came the job of > fullback on the Yale eleven.\\" At the end of the 1916 season, LeGore was selected as a second-team All- American by Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly, International News Service, Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune, and Paul Purman, noted sports writer whose All-American team was syndicated in newspapers across the United States, and University of Michigan football coach Fielding H. Yost. In selecting LeGore as an All-American, Walter Camp called him \\"one of the nation's greatest athletes.\\" World War I With the entry of the United States into World War I, LeGore was one of ten Yale students recommended by the President of Yale for commissions in the United States Marine Corps. LeGore served overseas for two years with the Second Division. Business and political career After his discharge from the Marines, LeGore worked for the LeGore Lime Company. In 1930, LeGore was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. In 1934, he was elected to the Maryland State Senate. In 1936, he made an unsuccessful run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. LeGore eventually became president of the LeGore Lime Company and also served as a director of the Potomac Edison Company. Posthumous honors In 1977, LeGore was inducted into Maryland's Alvin G. Quinn Memorial Sports Hall of Fame. In 1999, The News-Post in Maryland picked LeGore as one of the Top 25 most significant sports figures in the history of Frederick County. He was the county's first athlete to be selected as a collegiate All-American.

It hosted large events as well as band performances and remained in place for five or six years.Macaluso, p. 27 In 1931, Cermak suggested free concerts to lift spirits of Chicagoans during the Great Depression.Knox, p. 15 The Depression and the proliferation of new technological innovations such as records, radios and sound films led to a declining demand for live music and a shrinking job market for musicians.Macaluso, p. 50 That year, as buildings were being built for the 1933 Century of Progress International Exposition, the Chicago Concert Band Association offered to organize a seventy-person concert band to give free summer concerts if the park commissioners would build a band shell that had electric lighting and dressing rooms.Macaluso, p. 35 Construction on the wood and fiber E. V. Buchsbaum design began on a budget of $12,500 ($ in today's dollars), and the opening of free concerts commenced on August 24, 1931. Construction was completed in three weeks.Macaluso, p. 59 On July 1, 1935, Petrillo oversaw the beginning of free concerts in Grant Park at the original bandshell located on the south end of the park across Lake Shore Drive from the Field Museum of Natural History.Macaluso, p. 6 Originally referred to as the Grant Park Band Shell, the bandshell was renamed and dedicated in honor of Petrillo in 1975.Knox, p. 14 Petrillo Music Shell in front of the Chicago Skyline (Including CNA Center, Willis Tower and Legacy Tower) There were numerous plans and proposals to replace the original band shell beginning almost as soon as the Festival began.Macaluso, p. 8 Among the most prominent was a post-WWII (1946) plan to have a fifteen-thousand-seat butterfly-design retractible canopy band shell on the block immediately east of the Art Institute of Chicago that eventually came to host the second incarnation of the Petrillo Music Shell.Macaluso, p. 93 In 1953 a referendum was almost held on the November 3 Election Day ballot for a $3 million ($) structure, but at the last minute a bond issue was denied.Macaluso, p. 102 In 1963, a plan for a ten thousand seat music bowl was propounded.Macaluso, p. 114 By the 1970s the original bandshell had deteriorated to the point where \\"stagehands, performers and even a grand piano had fallen through the stage floor.\\"Gilfoyle, p. 59 Amid the catastrophes, the musicians joked about the need for hard hats. Despite $77,000 ($) in 1977 repair expenditures by the city, the performers were considering cancelling the 1978 season.Macaluso, p. 132 Deed restrictions dating from the city's early history generally forbid any buildings in Grant Park between Randolph Drive and 11th Place.Joseph D. Kearney & Thomas W. Merrill, Private Rights in Public Lands: The Chicago Lakefront, Montgomery Ward, and the Public Dedication Doctrine, 105 Northwestern Univ. L. Rev. 1417 (2011) As the result of a series of Illinois Supreme Court rulings, Grant Park has been \\"forever open, clear and free\\" since 1836, which was a year before the city of Chicago was incorporated.Macaluso, pp. 12‚Äì13 In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue \\"Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings. Aaron Montgomery Ward, who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones.Macaluso, pp. 23‚Äì25 As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. In 1972, plans were advanced to build a large new concrete-and-fiberglass band shell atop a new underground parking garage, but community groups defended the Ward restrictions. A compromise produced the inexpensive, staff-designed, demountable band shell at Butler Field, which opened in 1978.Macaluso, p. 45 The \\"semi-permanent\\" designation skirted the Ward prohibitions and the new structure cost only $3 million ($ million).Macaluso, p. 133Macaluso, p. 135 With an official street address at 235 S. Columbus Drive, the music shell encompasses the entire block bounded by Lake Shore Drive to the east, Columbus Drive to the west, East Monroe Drive to the north and East Jackson Drive to the south. This places it a block east of the Art Institute of Chicago, a block north of Buckingham Fountain, and southeast of Millennium Park. The amphitheater and paved surface for public seating is in the southwest corner of the block. This has served as one of the main stages for recent Lollapalooza celebrations. History left Concerts began at the band shell in August 1931. In July 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt made a campaign stop at the bandshell on his way to make his acceptance speech as the Democratic nominee for president at the 1932 Democratic National Convention at Chicago Stadium. In 1934, the twenty-two separate parks merged under the Park Consolidation Act, in order to gain New Deal federal funding.Macaluso, p. 54 Mayor Edward Kelley named Chicago Federation of Musicians President Petrillo to the board of the Chicago Park District. Petrillo suggested a free symphonic concert series in Grant Park. Under the agreement, Petrillo would raise money for the first season and if it was well-attended, the Park District would continue the program.Macaluso, p. 39 The first season of the Grant Park Music Festival began on July 1, 1935 and ran until Labor Day with a total of sixty- five concerts. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Women's Symphony Orchestra and the Civic Opera Orchestra each performed five or six times. Large concert bands led by Bohumir Kryl, Armin Hand, Max Bendix, George Dasch, Glenn Bainum, and Victor Grabel also performed. By the end of the summer crowds of up to 35,000 were attending nightly free concerts. The summer's total attendance was estimated at 1.9 million.Macaluso, p. 60 This was viewed as a sufficient success that the Park District committed to assuming financial responsibility for the entire ongoing annual outdoor concert series. The concerts for the first season were also broadcast on nationwide radio broadcasts. View of the bandshell from the seats. The bandshell hosted symbolic events during World War II. The July 1942 celebration of the city's 10,000th United States Navy recruit with a 500-sailor representation from Navy Pier to salute the color guard was held at the band shell.Macaluso, p. 40 In 1944, a public address system was added and following the war Grant Park usage increased heavily. Between the scheduling of Van Cliburn's 1958 Grant Park Music Festival appearance and his actual July 16 appearance, he won the quadrennial International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow that April. He was catapulted to international fame for winning one of the world's elite music competitions. As a result, he was greeted with a celebration that included a ticker tape parade down Michigan Avenue, and his Grant Park Music Festival appearance was a major event.Macaluso, p. 96 The following year, the band shell served as the host location for three concerts for the opening celebration of the 1959 Pan American Games.Macaluso, p. 111 In 1978, the new band shell began hosting events such as Taste of Chicago, an annual July 3 Independence Day fireworks celebration, the Chicago Blues, Jazz and Gospel Festivals. In October 1979, Pope John Paul II presided over the largest public mass ever held in Chicago on a terraced altar platform that was erected next to the band shell. Joseph Bernardin delivered a homily on the same kind of platform after being promoted to Archbishop of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. The Dalai Lama has held an event at the band shell and rallies celebrating the National Basketball Association championships by the Chicago Bulls occurred at the band shell. In 1998, at a Grant Park Music Festival performance, the miniature prototype of the Talaske-designed audio system that would eventually be used at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion was tested. Since 2005, the Music Shell has been used as a stage for the annual Lollapalooza festival. Controversies When the Pritzker Pavilion was built members of the Petrillo family wanted it named after James Petrillo. There has been much debate about which concerts and festivals should remain at the Petrillo and which should be moved to the Pritzker Pavilion. The initial plan was that the larger annual music festivals such as the Blues and Jazz Festivals and Taste of Chicago would continue to be held in Petrillo Music Shell because they are too large to be hosted at the Pavilion. However, smaller festivals such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival have been hosted at the Pavilion since 2005. There has been public opinion that some of the Blues and Jazz Festival smaller events should be moved to the better and more modern acoustics of the Pavilion. By 2009, as the city grappled with a budget deficit, it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals with the more modern venue and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones there. Notes General admission seating includes the Petrillo Lawn and Butler Field.

He intended it only as a storage site for his father's salty comments, but a friend posted a link to it. Comedian Rob Corddry then tweeted the link, and that really \\"jump-started it\\" according to Halpern. In less than a month, the page was mentioned by The Daily Show, a popular San Francisco blog called Laughing Squid, and actress Kristen Bell. As of July, 2016, the feed has 2.9 million followers. Adaptations Book In September 2009, Halpern found an agent and started sifting through book deals. He signed an agreement with Harper Collins in October 2009. The book based on the feed, titled Sh*t My Dad Says, was co-written with Halpern's longtime writing partner Patrick Schumacker, and was released on May 4, 2010. During its first week, the book reached #8 on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction. For six weeks after its release, the book was #1 on the bestseller list.

(retrieved 17 Nov 2009) Gunstock clubs were most predominantly used by Eastern Woodland, Central and Northern Plains tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries.Taylor, 23 Iowa tribal gunstock war club, ca. 1800‚Äì1850, Nebraska History Although well known as an indigenous weapon encountered in several North American First Nations tribes across the northern United States and Canada, details of its early development continue to elude historians. They were first used in the late 17th century but were in use by Northern Plains tribes, such as the Lakota by the mid-19th century.Taylor, 24 Many sources have claimed that indigenous tribes created the design based upon European firearms.\\"Gunstock club 1886.1.818.\\" Pitt Rivers Museum. (retrieved 17 Nov 2009) The tribes who encountered British, French, and colonial soldiers were impressed by their usage of a musket that, once its shot was spent, could easily be reversed, held by the metal barrel, and used as a harrowing bludgeoning weapon in close quarters combat. Other historical sources have claimed that several tribes obtained muskets from traders and later modified them into club weapons. However, with substantial holes already carved out of the crook of the gunstock‚Äîthe focal striking area‚Äîfor the metal loading and firing mechanisms of the musket, a club of this design would not have withstood repeated usage before breaking. Furthermore, none of the original war clubs excavated from archaeological digs have borne any indication that they started out as an actual firearm, as they lack lock and barrel inlets, and many are instead flat and board-like. Another theory is that muskets and rifles of sixteenth-century Europeans merely provided the inspiration for the design of the gunstock war club, its designers possibly trying to capitalize on the awe and terror created by European muskets by fashioning similarly designed clubs. Carrying these clubs closely resembling European muskets, American Indian tribes might have gained a psychological advantage over rival tribes in battle. A third theory posed by some historians and several American Indian activist groups contends that the gunstock war club is simply a coincidence of design, developed independently years before the arrival of Europeans. Design Alongside other indigenous weapons excelling in blunt force trauma injuries‚Äîsuch as the ball-head clubs and stone-head tomahawks‚Äîthe gunstock has a significant presence in tribal warfare across several different American Indian nations. War clubs were usually made of straight grain hardwoods like maple, ash, oak, hickory or hornbeam (depending on the region of its use), and weighed from two to three pounds. With swinging force focused onto the small striking edges of the club, the gunstock club could hit with remarkable power. The lethality of the club was further increased by the addition of a short spear point or one or more blades positioned near the elbow of the club. Blades could be flint, horn, or iron. An inspiration for the heart-shaped blade may have been the ornate European pole-arm, the spontoon. The introduction of forged iron and steel knives from European settlers to American Indian tribes across the United States may have contributed to the popularity of the gunstock club. For example, an excavated Plains Indian carved gunstock club from the late 19th century was found set with three butcher knife blades marked \\"Lamson and Goodnow Mfg. Co. Patent March 6, 1860.\\"McQueeney-Jones Mascolo, Frances \\"American Indian & Ethnographic Art Sells Well At Skinner Auction.\\" Antiques and the Arts Online.\\" 10 Nov 2009 (retrieved 17 Nov 2009) The clubs were often embellished with brass tacks and the wood was carved with geometric or representational designs. In use today In Native American society, gunstock clubs are used as part of pow wow regalia or in other formal occasions. The gunstock war club is the primary weapon of practitioners of Okichitaw, a martial art based on the fighting techniques of the Assiniboine and Plains Cree Indians.\\"Oki Chi Taw - Martial Arts and Weapon Applications.\\" Native Canadian Centre of Toronto Martial Arts, Toronto, Ontario.

Larwill Park was the location of the bus depot of Pacific Coach Stage Lines and Greyhound Bus Lines from World War II until 1993, when the bus depot moved to Pacific Central Station. Since then, Larwill Park has been a parking lot. The Vancouver Art Gallery has selected it for the location of a new museum building. Location and history Bounded by Cambie, Dunsmuir, Beatty and Georgia Streets, the former park occupied a whole city block and was laid out at the time of the CPR Townsite survey in the early 1880s. It was Vancouver's second sporting grounds, the first being on Brockton Point in what is now Stanley Park, and was used for all kinds of sports. A house on the corner of the lot was occupied by an Alfred Larwill (\\"Al\\" or \\"Fred\\") who good-naturedly stored all kinds of game equipment in his toolshed and allowed team members to use his dining room for a dressing room. Located midway between the city's old downtown around Gastown Hastings Street and newer areas uptown around Granville, the park naturally became a centre for public meetings, the most infamous one was a rally by the Knights of Labour which led to the Anti- Oriental Riots of 1907, with the Beatty Street Drill Hall, across Beatty Street on the block's northeast flank, serving as a stage and podium. Baseball, cricket and lacrosse teams made use of the field year round. The playing fields also served as military drill-grounds, with the city's first muster being called up for the Boer War using the site for that purpose, as well as for World Wars I and II. The site was also a main site for rallies of demonstrations by the unemployed and labour organizations in the 1930s. In July 1943 (during World War II), a ceremony was held to dedicate the park to Al Larwill, some 32 years after his death in 1911.\\"Cambie Street parking lot hides turn-of-the-century sporting paradise\\", Archie McDonald, The Vancouver Sun, Feb. 4, 1994: D16 However, later that year, while the men who had used it for sport and politics were away at war and not around to prevent it, the site was converted into the bus depot. 2010 Olympics Often used for parking by Canada Post trucks and for film production \\"circuses\\", the lot was one of two main sites for cultural events and \\"nightly celebrations\\", although not an official venue, during the 2010 Winter Olympics.It's Vancouver, but not as we know it, Vancouver Sun, June 3, 2008 Vancouver 2010 Party PlacesStaging The Games, Jeff Lee, Vancouver Sun, February 11, 2008 Images on Flickr In the Vancouver Stanley cup riots of June 15, 2011, violence erupted in Downtown Vancouver following Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Rioting crowds entered the lot and multiple cars were burned. Future Vancouver Art Gallery site After the bus depot vacated Larwill Park in 1993, it became the only block of vacant public land in downtown Vancouver. It was proposed as a location for various cultural facilities, including the Vancouver Art Gallery. On April 24, 2013, Vancouver City Council voted to designate the property for a new Art Gallery building.

She trained as a sculptor with Ralph Stackpole and Alexander Archipenko, working in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco between 1930 and 1945. Widowed in World War II, she turned to ceramics, studying with Antonio Prieto at California College of Arts and Crafts (now California College of the Arts), and was an active studio artist and leader in potters' and craftsmen circles in the Bay Area from 1946 to 1969. In 1969, she moved to Bolinas, California, and in 1994, she was given a retrospective at the small but respected Bolinas Museum, which revived her reputation.  Early life  Born in Newton, New Jersey and raised in Tucson, Arizona, where her father was rector of Grace Episcopal Church, Mary Tuthill showed talent in art, writing, and acting. The desert's plant and animal life, landforms and colors strongly influenced her visual esthetic. Her first work of art, at age 11, was a miniature adobe house. She suffered several childhood diseases, including typhoid fever, and was only sporadically enrolled in school. She was instructed by tutors and had the run of her father's vast, eclectic library. Her esthetic was also influenced by her mother's design sense and cultural interests, particularly musical. At the age of 14, upset over a news photograph of a lynching, Mary Tuthill joined the NAACP, and from then on was an ardent political and social activist.  Art education  She began studying sculpture with Ralph Stackpole at the California School of Fine Arts (now San Francisco Art Institute) in 1930.\\"Students Carve Statues in Red Sandstone from Mansion,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, April 18, 1931Townsend, Betsy, \\"Mystery Girl Hit of Oakland Art Show: Mary Tuthill No Novice to Art World,\\" Oakland Herald Tribune, May 8, 1941 In 1934 she met Alexander Archipenko, who arranged for a scholarship for her at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. Her first major exhibition was a juried group show at Transigram Studios in Los Angeles, where she won an Award of Merit. She moved to New York in the late 1930s and in 1938 studied briefly with Isamu Noguchi and Jose de Creeft. She excelled in terracotta, stone carving and direct plaster. Archipenko was her most influential teacher. She became good friends with him and his wife, sculptor Gela Forster (Angelica Archipenko, daughter of Bruno Schmitz), and he hired her to teach with him at summer session at the University of Washington in Seattle and at his summer school in Woodstock, New York. Noguchi was also an important influence, though her studies with him were brief.  Middle career  In the summer of 1946, Lindheim entered the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland to study with ceramist Antonio Prieto. She was awarded a scholarship after a semester of study, and within a year she was exhibiting with some of the best studio potters in the United States. She became active in the movements to achieve respect for ceramics and other studio craft, elevate standards for potters and encourage them to think beyond utilitarian ware, and encourage the development of a pottery for America‚Äîbuilding from many traditions but going forward with the country's unique pioneering energy.Glaser, Jeanne, \\"Historian's Report: Mary Lindheim, ACCA President 1952,\\" Association of California Ceramic Artists Newsletter, 1988, p. 3 She was president of the Association of San Francisco Potters, founded in 1945 by F. Carlton Bell, and was active as an officer and exhibitor in San Francisco Women Artists. She was a co-founder of Designer-Craftsmen of California, and for many years participated as an installation designer, juror and/or planner of the Sausalito Art Fair.\\"Top Prize of Crafts Show to Lindheim,\\" Sausalito News, April 1957 As a potter, Lindheim excelled in stoneware and surface treatments, including carved and inlaid work, and her glazes, which she always mixed herself, included a heavily textured and exquisitely controlled crawl glaze she developed in the early 1950s.Sellers, Thomas, \\"Throwing on the Potter's Wheel,\\" Professional Publications, Inc., 1960, p. 21. She always considered herself a sculptor first, and worked in diverse forms and in many different media. From 1946 to 1969 both her ceramics and her sculptural wall panels and mosaics employing magnesite, sand, metal, stones, and pebbles were widely exhibited and won many awards.Special California Issue, Craft Horizons, September‚ÄìOctober 1956, p. 31\\"Prize-Winning Ceramist,\\" Independent Journal, June 1, 1957, p. M12 She lived for most of those years in Forest Knolls and Sausalito.  Later life  In 1969, she moved to Bolinas, a coastal community in west Marin County, and continued to pursue her art, but at a slower pace. There she worked on a family biography, Dad and His Family. It was completed after her death and is unpublished. She was married three times, to Jack Hereford (1928), William Robson (1933) and Donald Lindheim (1941). Tragically, Donald Lindheim died in the last few days of the war in 1945. She turned to ceramics to continue her art and make a living, and kept his name as her professional name. In 1994, Lindheim came out of semi-retirement when she was given a retrospective at the Bolinas Museum.Underwood, Tyson, \\"Fifty-year scope: Viewing art as dynamic process,\\" Pacific Sun, August 10‚Äì16, 1994, p. 18 For the first time the public saw the breadth of her creative work ‚Äì wall panels, mosaics, ceramics, sculpture, and jewelry ‚Äì in the same place. She had retained most of her best work, living frugally so she would not have to sell more than absolutely necessary. Some of the work in the retrospective now resides in the permanent collections of the Oakland Museum of California and the Bolinas Museum. The remainder is in other museums, private collections, and the estate of the artist. Gallery Image:MaryTuthillLindheim-towards- unity.jpgTowards Unity, 1959/1993.

Later ones have bowls formed of silver or of a coconut or ostrich egg with silver mounts. Cups with coconut bowls (see illustration) mounted in silver or silver-gilt and raised on a stem and foot, or multiple feet, were fashionable rareties in Western Europe in the late 15th century and throughout the 16th century.

Its title stems from a famous quote by Albert Einstein: \\"I cannot predict how the Third World War shall be fought, or with what; I can, however, predict that the Fourth World War shall be waged with sticks and stones.\\" Plot Colonel Jack Knowles (Roy Scheider) is a tough, professional soldier who was decorated for gallantry in Vietnam. However, the same gung ho mentality that made Knowles a hero in wartime makes him a dangerous loose cannon in peacetime. He is stationed at an outpost on the West German-Czechoslovakia border and immediately gets into a dangerous personal war with his Soviet counterpart Colonel Valachev. The two men ironically have many of the same characteristics. Knowles is enraged when he has to stand by as a would be refugee is shot on the border and immediately begins crossing the border on dangerous solo missions to sabotage the enemy installations. Knowles comes into conflict with his by the book second-in- command Lieutenant Colonel Clark, and Knowles' superior, General Hackworth, angrily orders him to desist, but to no avail. The petty war between the two men threatens to escalate into a full scale conflict as they engage in hand- to-hand combat on a frozen lake with their countries' armies on both sides ready to begin a full scale war. Knowles only relents at the last moment to avoid the conflict. Cast *Roy Scheider ... Colonel Jack Knowles *J√ºrgen Prochnow ... Colonel Valachev *Tim Reid ...

It was founded in 2006 and has since grown to become the most active free thinking student society in the United Kingdom as well as being instrumental in the foundation of the National Federation of Atheist, Humanist and Secular Student Societies. Activities As well as the group's regular activities, the society has developed and piloted many events which have gone on to be used on a national level by other groups in the United Kingdom. In particular the group was the first to develop the concept of a non-belief awareness week which has since been adopted by groups at the University of Southampton, Durham University, University of Liverpool and on a national level by the British Humanist Association. They are regular supporters of the annual charity week ran by the AHS, Non-Prophet Week. In April 2009 the group appointed their first humanist chaplain, Nicola Jackson in 2010. The group also began an annual irreligious camping weekend, which was later run by the AHS and named Questival. Controversy The group has faced controversy during several times in its history. In 2007 the group ran a talk entitled \\"I'll Mock Muhammad if I want to\\" as a talk on freedom of speech following the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The talk itself did not contain any of the cartoons. The group ran into further controversy in 2008 when the president submitted a motion for the Leeds University Union referendum to stop selling Halal and Kosher meat following the Farm Animal Welfare Council's recommendations in 2004 that such practices were unethical and should be stopped. The motion was rejected by the union council before going to ballot. The group has also been the victim of several controversial events. In 2007 the group filed a discrimination complaint against the interfaith chair. In 2009 the group's awareness week was overshadowed by death threats made against society members and vandalism of the society's property following a heated debate with the Islamic Society. The group has also faced regular theft or defacement of its banners and posters.

The North American version, entitled Heroes of Three Kingdoms, was announced on April 12, 2010 by Perfect World Entertainment, the US subsidiary of Perfect World Co. Heroes of Three Kingdoms entered Closed Beta on July 13, 2010. The closure of the North American version of the game was announced on September 29, 2011. The game closed on November 1, 2011, and the forums and website were removed at the same time, making that act the fastest response time for any service pwi performed on the game. Lack of customer support, as well as player abuse of glitches to cheat gameplay, remain the legacy of the game's downfall. Cubizone no longer includes Chi Bi in its game list.  Plot  The story of the game is based on the well-known time period of China, the Three Kingdoms. During this era, the country is in the midst of a civil war. Among the groups fighting, three leaders stand out: Cao Cao of Wei, Liu Bei of Shu, and Sun Quan of Wu. In this game, players can choose to join any of the three warring factions (Wei, Shu, or Wu).  Characters  Upon creating a character and entering the game, your character has no affiliations but eventually is given the choice to pick a side and choose one of the Three Kingdoms from ancient China to fight for: the historically-based Cao Wei, Shu Han or Eastern Wu Kingdoms. Players must choose a weapon when they create their character. Depending on the weapon chosen, this will determine their class and available skills. Players can choose from the following weapons: Glaive, Spear, Halberd, Cleaver, Multiblade (originally called the Trident), Staff, Saber, Hatchets, Hammer, Hooksword, Mace, Talons, Gauntlets, Ring Blade, Scepter, Charmer, War Fan, and Bow. Weapons added later in later patches include the Stick, Shield, Whip, and Crossbow. Aside from deciding on which kingdom to join, players are also required to pick a race for their character upon creation. The game features two races: the Yan and the Miao. Both races progress from their respective starting locations to Xiliang.

Editor: Stanislav Zvon√≠ƒçek, published in cooperation with the Czechoslovak Film Institute. ARTIA) is a 1964 film directed by Milo≈° Forman. It won the Golden Leopard award at the Locarno International Film Festival. Plot Petr, a Czech teenager, begins working as a trainee in theft prevention at a grocery store. He is criticized by his employer for being too conspicuous and then, when he suspects a man of stealing, is too nervous to confront the man so he just follows him through the streets and then returns home, where his father admonishes him because the shop manager had come looking for him. His father peppers him with questions about how he acted and why he did not do anything to stop the man. Petr likes Pavla, who is dating Mara. Petr and Pavla go for a swim together and then lie on the grass, where they are harassed by ƒåenda and Zdenƒõk, two apprentice bricklayers. Later, at a party, the drunken ƒåenda sees them together and repeatedly argues with Petr. He becomes upset when the master mason notices them fighting and blames Petr for making him look bad in front of the boss, then asks to borrow money. Petr lends him the money and ƒåenda buys more drinks to work up the courage to tell a girl in blue that he likes her, but the girl in blue has already begun to dance with someone else. Petr dances with Pavla but is unfamiliar with the popular moves. When he gets home, his mother interrogates him about all the details of the evening. The next day Petr delivers two prints of famous paintings to the shop but one falls and breaks the glass and frame. He takes the print, of a naked woman, with him on a date with Pavla. The next day at work Petr sees the man he followed before and notifies his boss, but his boss shakes the man's hand and takes him into the back room. Confused, Petr watches a woman steal several bags of sweets by hiding them in her bag but does not stop her. Petr once again faces a barrage of questions from his father about his behavior and why he failed to act. His father suspects that his inaction was in retaliation for something that had gone wrong at the shop but Petr refuses to explain. His father laments the fact that he invested in a violin and an accordion that remained unused while Petr bought a guitar that is unable to earn him any money. As Petr's father is yelling at him, ƒåenda knocks on the door. Petr's parents insist that ƒåenda come inside and sit down. ƒåenda returns the money that Petr lent him and Petr's mother offers him a piece of cake. When they learn that ƒåenda is an apprentice bricklayer, Petr's father makes ƒåenda show Petr his hands so that his son can see what hardworking hands look like. Zdenƒõk reminds ƒåenda that they must leave. ƒåenda attempts to stay because he finds the family fight interesting but when he is asked by Petr's father what is so interesting he backs away in fear. Petr's father continues with the argument, attempting to explain his perspective on what is important.

Life  Voss was born in Flensburg, Germany. During the spring and early summer of 1943, the four crematoria at Auschwitz-Birkenau became operational. It was this time that Voss became their commander, thus becoming the first of three people who would be in charge of all four Birkenau crematoria during the history of the camp. Subsequent commanders were SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Eric Muhsfeldt and SS- Hauptscharf√ºhrer Otto Moll. Voss is frequently mentioned in the memoirs of Sonderkommando member Filip M√ºller. M√ºller described him as a stocky man of medium height, with a small, slightly hooked nose and a weakness for alcohol, stating that he displayed \\"neither the fanaticism nor the zeal\\" of Otto Moll. He stated that his SS training had turned him into an \\"uncritical and willing tool rather than a fanatically cruel exterminator\\", and offers the analogy that Voss has two personalities: one where he could be \\"high-spirited, laughing and joking and talking about trivial things\\", and another where he would be completely indifferent to \\"shooting men, women and children one after the other\\" when required of him.M√ºller (1999), p. 128 M√ºller disclosed that another of Voss' weaknesses was valuables such as gold, diamonds, and currency: these could be sewn into discreet places in his uniform under the pretence that if he left it with a tailor from the Sonderkommando while he was on leave, it would be repaired. According to M√ºller, Voss knew what was going on, but such behaviour was common among SS men: they were willing to turn a blind eye as long as there was no risk to themselves.  Hungarian action  Voss' tenure ended on May 9, 1944, when SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Rudolf H√∂ss, beginning his second tour of duty as camp commandant, appointed Otto Moll as chief of the crematoria in preparation for the arrival and destruction of the Jews of Hungary. Voss was placed in charge of Crematoria IV and V. He died in 1976.

President of the Kyrgyz History Society (elected on 11 February 2012), Doctor of History (1998), Professor of the Kyrgyz State National University named after Jusup Balasagyn (2002). Dr. Tchoroev is well known as an independent history researcher, Turkologist and journalist. Until September 2011, he worked as a broadcaster at Radio Azattyk, i.e. Kyrgyz Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (he was Director of the Kyrgyz Service between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2010). He was Chairman of the Board of the Muras (Heritage) Foundation under the Office of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic (between 30 August 2013 and 4 May 2017).  A short biography  He was born in the village of Echki-Bashy in the On-Archa village area in Naryn district of Naryn region in Northern Kyrgyzstan on 28 March 1959. His grandfather Choro (Choro-Hajji) Aity uulu was a wealthy person, who made a pilgrimage to Mecca long before the 1916 anti-Tsarist uprising of the Kyrgyzstanis. Choro-Hajji died in 1927, i.e. a little bit earlier than the launch of the extradition campaign for the rich Kyrgyz people by the Stalinist regime in the last years of the 1920s. Choro Hajji's mausoleum built in the 1927‚Äì28, still exists near the village of Echki-Bashy. Bekbolot, Choro-Hajji's grandchild from his older son, died during the Stalinist purge, due to his connection with a wealthy family. Choro-Hajji's wife, Suyumkan Malay kyzy, was a daughter of a wealthy person from a neighboring Ming-Bulak village. She was educated before the Soviet regime, that is why she could read the Koran in Arabic. Kadyrmambet Tchoroev (or Choroev), the older son of Choro and Suyumkan, was married to his cousin, Aliya Kydyraaly kyzy, the daughter of Kydyraaly and Seidana Malay kyzy. Seidana was also a well-educated woman, who could read the Koran and write in Arabic script. However, the Arabic script was officially banned in Kyrgyzstan in 1928-29, when the Soviet Kyrgyz were transferred to the Latin script (until 1939-40), and due to that the grand mothers of Tyntchtykbek were officially recognized as \\"uneducated\\" women. Kadyrmambet and Aliya had five sons and three daughters. Tyntchtykbek is the fourth in the family. In the early years, he was brought up by both Suyumkan and Seidana, the grand mothers from father's and mother's side. Tyntchtykbek used to go to the summer-time pasture of Solton-Sary together with the family until the autumn of 1966. The older brothers and his older sister helped him to learn ABC even before he started to go to a primary school. He started to go to the Echki-Bashy village school in September 1966. After finishing the 8th class in the village, he went to Naryn to study at the No 1 Toktogul Satylgan-uulu secondary school there. He graduated the secondary school named after Toktogul Satylgan-uulu in the town of Naryn with a silver medal in 1976. Then he became a student of the history faculty at the Kyrgyz State University (now - the Kyrgyz National University named after Jusup Balasagyn). During his student time, he was actively participating in the scholarly and literature circles in the capital city of Frunze (nowadays Bishkek). He graduated the university in Bishkek with the so-called \\"Red diploma\\" in 1981.  Education and scholarly background  He graduated at the History Faculty of the Kyrgyz State University (now - the Kyrgyz National University) in Bishkek (then - Frunze), the capital of then Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic in 1981. He studied in Tashkent at the Oriental Institute named after Abu Reihan Beruni of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences in 1983-1988 and defended his first doctoral thesis devoted to the Eastern Turkic groups' migrations in the 9th - 13th centuries according to the medieval Muslim sources (in Russian language; Tashkent, December 1988). He led the Chair of the Ancient and Medieval History (1989‚Äì1991) and the Chair of the Asian and African States History (1992‚Äì1994) at the Kyrgyz National University. Then he studied for his doctorate at the same university (1994‚Äì1997) and defended his doctoral thesis devoted to the epoch and life of Mahmud al-Kashghari (al-Barsqani), the Eastern Turkic scholar lived in the 11th century, and his scientific legacy. It was defended at the Kyrgyzstan National Academy of Sciences on 10 April 1998 (in Kyrgyz language). His new monograph on the topic was published by the Muras Foundation in September 2017.See a Turkish-language review: Karatayev, Olcobay; Yƒ±lmaz, Mehmet Serhat; Yakuboƒülu, Cevdet. ‚ÄúD√Æv√¢nu Lug√¢ti 't-T√ºrk‚Äù Adlƒ± Eserin Tamamlanmasƒ±nƒ±n 940.

Dr. Tyntchtykbek Tchoroev (Chorotegin) during his visit to Berlin, Germany. 17 July 2008.  Textbooks and Turkology publications  Tchoroev (Chorotegin) has published several monographs and books in Kyrgyz and Russian languages (since 1990) and several textbooks devoted to the ancient and medieval history of the Kyrgyz people and their neighbors in Central and Inner Asia. The first post-Soviet Kyrgyz textbooks for the secondary schools in Kyrgyzstan by him in co-authorship with Professor Toktorbek Omurbekov have been translated from Kyrgyz into Russian and Uzbek languages. The textbooks for the secondary schools are being officially distributed by the Education Ministry in Kyrgyzstan since 1996 until now (January 2013). Some his articles on Kyrgyz history and medieval sources were published by UNESCO, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Kyrgyz National Encyclopedia, Soviet Encyclopedia, etc. (in Kyrgyzstan, the United States, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, China, Uzbekistan).  Public activities  Tyntchtykbek Chorotegin (Tchoroev) together with Azamat Altay (1920-2006), the first broadcaster and former Director of the RFE/RL Kyrgyz Service, at the old headquarters of RFE/RL in Prague, Czech Republic (6 June 2003). Tchoroev (Chorotegin) was a pioneer and a member of the Kyrgyzstan Komsomol during his childhood time as an ordinary child of his country, then a part of the Soviet Union. At that time he was not aware that his father's elder brother was a victim of the Stalinist purge and died in an unknown part of Soviet Russia in a camp of the so-called Gulag. His view of the world was gradually changed in 1980-1988, especially during the Perestroika era. In 1987-88, during the era of Perestroika in the U.S.S.R., he was one of the Kyrgyz intellectuals to fight for the equal statute of the Kyrgyz language with the official Russian language in his native republic. In 1989, during the Perestroika epoch, he became one of the young Kyrgyz intellectuals to fight for a national identity of the Kyrgyz people. He was a founding member and one of the leaders of the Kyrgyzstan's Young Historians Association, the first nongovernmental organization of the Kyrgyz historians to challenge the official Soviet Kyrgyz historiography. First, he was deputy chairman, then the chairman of the Kyrgyzstan's Young Historians Association which was established despite the obstacles from then Communist leadership in Kyrgyzstan, on 3 June 1989. It was the first nongovernmental organization to hold its founding conference in the Kyrgyz language with a simultaneous Russian translation. The Kyrgyzstan Writers Union, led by a prominent writer and statesman Chingiz Aitmatov, supported the young Kyrgyz historians by allowing them to hold their conference in the Union's hall (free of charge). He was the co-author of the new program of the Kyrgyz history for the secondary schools published in September 1989 in both Kyrgyz and Russian languages in the Mugalimder Gazetasy (The Teachers‚Äô Newspaper), the official media outlet of the Kyrgyz Education Ministry, where the previous Kyrgyz historiography views were challenged by the new ideas. He was elected as a member of the Board of the Kyrgyz Republic's Public Radio and TV Broadcasting Company (KTRK) by the Kyrgyzstan Parliament on 18 April 2012. He became a member of the Official commission for development of the history science under Kyrgyz President (the decree was signed by the Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev on 25 April 2012.)  Political activities  In 1990 January and February, Tchoroev (Chorotegin) participated at the protest rally of the democracy-oriented Kyrgyz youth in Bishkek. Then he was one of the main organizers of the round tables with participation of the young Kyrgyz scholars, students and young workers and the Kyrgyz Soviet officials (February ‚Äì April 1990). In April, Tchoroev (Chorotegin) became a member of the underground political party of Asaba (Flag), and participated at the first ever anti-Communist rally organized by the party on 1 May 1990 in Bishkek. The columns of the rally participants followed by the officially allowed Communist-run columns through the Central Ala-Too square in Bishkek. The difference of the Asaba Party's column was in their slogans written on the blue placards demanding to build democracy and to stop the one-party-ruling system in Soviet Kyrgyzstan. Tchoroev (Chorotegin) was one of the organizers of the Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyzstan Demokratialyk Kyimyly, KDK), the first umbrella bloc for several opposition parties, movements and nongovernmental organizations in Kyrgyzstan (1990 - 1993). (See: Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan.) The founding Congress of the KDK was held in Bishkek on 25‚Äì26 May 1990. At the Congress, he presented a report on the Regulations of the KDK (he was the author of the draft of the Regulations. The core ideas of the KDK's Regulations were based upon similar documents of the anti- Communist democratic movements of the Baltic states). In October 1990, he participated at the international conference of the anti-Communist organizations from several Soviet republics, including some separatist republics, in Kiev. He witnessed the anti-Communist hunger strike of the Ukrainian students there. In 19‚Äì27 October 1990, Tchoroev (Chorotegin) also was amongst organizers and active participants of the similar hunger strike action in Frunze (nowadays Bishkek), the capital city of Kyrgyzstan, organized by the KDK. The protest action with demands to democratize then the Soviet Central Asian republic, ended with the victory of the democracy-oriented politicians: Askar Akayev, a Kyrgyz academician who started to criticize the ruling Communist regime, was elected by the parliament as the first ever Kyrgyzstan President. In 1992, he was one of the co-authors of the alternate draft of the post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan Constitution (published in both Kyrgyz and Russian). He was a member of the Free Kyrgyzstan (Erkin Kyrgyzstan) Democratic Party at that time. At the beginning of 1993, Tchoroev (Chorotegin) ceased all the political activities (including the party membership) due to his journalism duties and scholarly career.  Journalism, literature, and reporting  His first ever political pamphlet was published by the monthly satirical and humorous magazine Chalkan (Stinging-Nettle) in October 1974, when he was still a school boy. It was written under influence of the Soviet propaganda machine about the Western world. Tchoroev (Chorotegin) published several humorous short stories in Kyrgyz in several newspapers, magazines, almanacs and a small book (1974‚Äì1986). He published a lot of reports and publicist articles on cultural and social life of Kyrgyzstanis, people of Central Asia and China in Kyrgyz and Russian languages. Tchoroev (Chorotegin) translated two books from English into Kyrgyz: The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism, 1988, by Friedrich August von Hayek, published in Bishkek in 1998 () and The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community: With a Retrospective Essay, 1991, by William Hardy McNeill (its ancient and early medieval ages part), published in Bishkek in 2002 (). The both translations were published by the Soros-Kyrgyzstan Foundation. He edited several books in Kyrgyz and Russian, including monographs by a Kyrgyz orientalist Omurkul Kara uulu (Karaev), a Russian archeology professor Yuliy Khudiakov, the Kyrgyz historians Arslan Koichiev, Akylbek Kylychev, Oljobay Karatayev, a lawyer Sabyrbek Kojonaliev, some English-Kyrgyz dictionaries for children, etc. In 1991 April Tchoroev (Chorotegin) became the second freelancer to work for the Kyrgyz Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty inside the country. He was the first chief of the Bishkek Bureau of the Radio Azattyk (the Kyrgyz Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) in 1992‚Äì1995, 1996‚Äì1998). Tchoroev (Chorotegin) worked as a producer of the BBC Kyrgyz Service (based in London) in April 1998 ‚Äì July 2000. He became a broadcaster of the Radio Azattyk (the Kyrgyz Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, based in Prague) in 25 July 2000. He was the director of the Service between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2010. On 16 August 2011, he ceased his broadcaster's position at the Prague headquarters of the Radio Azattyk. He is one of the active members of the Kyrgyz-language Wikipedia movement (since 2009). He was the Chairman of the Board of the Muras (Heritage) Foundation under the Office of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic (August 2013 to May 2017.) Translations of works from foreign languages into Kyrgyz He translated some books from English and Russian into Kyrgyz. One of them, entitled The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism, 1988, by Friedrich August von Hayek, was translated by T. Chorotegin alone and it was published in Kyrgyz in Bishkek in 1998 (). Another monograph entitled The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community: With a Retrospective Essay, 1991, by William Hardy McNeill (its ancient and early medieval ages part), was translated by him in collaboration with Dr. Arslan Koichiev and Dr. Taalaibek Abdiev. It was published in Kyrgyz in Bishkek in 2002 (). Both translations were published by the Soros- Kyrgyzstan Foundation. He also was amongst the three Kyrgyz translators of the book entitled Deng Xiaoping During the Cultural Revolution by Maomao (Deng Rong). It was translated from its Russian translation into Kyrgyz language and has been published by the Roza Otunbayeva Initiatives International Public Foundation (Bishkek, 2015. - 592 pages, ill. ‚Äì the Personalities with the Exemplary Life Series. - .)

He is best known as being a member of Outlaws and Blackhawk. Early life Yoho was born on March 26, 1952 in Lakeland, Florida. In 1965, when he was 13 years old, Yoho learned how to play the drums. Also in junior high school, he met future bandmate Hughie Thomasson and the two became close friends. Yoho and Thomasson later attended A.P. Leto High School in Tampa, Florida. In addition, Yoho was hired as a session musician in the late 1960s by the Darby, Florida-based band The Bellamy Brothers. In 1969, Yoho met Billy Jones while hitchhiking back from the Atlanta Pop Festival. He had heard of Jones as a musician also living in the Tampa Bay area. While in the car, they discussed forming a band upon return to Tampa. The result was The Dave Graham Group, with Jones and Dave Graham on guitar, Roy Holly on bass, and Yoho on drums. The quartet frequently collaborated with Thomasson- led band known as The Outlaws. The Outlaws Hughie Thomasson at an Outlaws concert in the 1970s . Yoho can be seen in the background behind the drums. After several lineup changes and a breakup, Thomasson decided to reform The Outlaws in 1972.Brant 1999, p. 162. Thomasson became the lead vocalist and one of the three guitarists, Tampa folk singer Henry Paul joined as another guitarist, and Frank O'Keefe was the bassist. Jones was originally to play drums for the newest incarnation of the band. However, Thomasson was impressed by the Allman Brothers Band's usage of two lead guitarists and convinced Jones to occupy the third guitar slot. Yoho thus became the band's drummer. The Outlaws developed a loyal following as they performed in many bars and clubs in the Tampa Bay area. While playing on a hillside for 2,000 college students in 1974, Charlie Brusco \\"discovered\\" the band and agreed to be their manager.

The method was introduced by sociologist and demographer Evelyn M. Kitagawa in 1955. Ronald Oaxaca introduced this method in economics in his doctoral thesis at Princeton University and eventually published in 1973. The decomposition technique also carries the name of Alan Blinder who proposed a similar approach in the same year. Oaxaca's original research question was the wage differential between two different groups of workers, but his method has since been applied to numerous other topics. Method The following three equations illustrate this decomposition. Estimate separate linear wage regressions for individuals i in groups A and B: : \\\\begin{align} (1) \\\\qquad \\\\ln(\\\\text{wages}_{A_i}) & = X_{A_i} \\\\beta_A + \\\\mu_{A_i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (2) \\\\qquad \\\\ln(\\\\text{wages}_{B_i}) & = X_{B_i} \\\\beta_B + \\\\mu_{B_i} \\\\end{align} where Œß is a vector of explanatory variables such as education, experience, industry, and occupation, Œ≤A and Œ≤B are vectors of coefficients and Œº is an error term. Let bA and bB be respectively the regression estimates of Œ≤A and Œ≤B. Then, since the average value of residuals in a linear regression is zero, we have: : \\\\begin{align} (3) \\\\qquad & \\\\operatorname{mean}(\\\\ln(\\\\text{wages}_A)) - \\\\operatorname{mean}(\\\\ln(\\\\text{wages}_B)) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & b_A \\\\operatorname{mean}(X_A) - b_B \\\\operatorname{mean}(X_B) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & b_A (\\\\operatorname{mean}(X_A) - \\\\operatorname{mean}(X_B)) + \\\\operatorname{mean}(X_B) (b_A - b_B) \\\\end{align} The first part of the last line of (3) is the impact of between-group differences in the explanatory variables X, evaluated using the coefficients for group A. The second part is the differential not explained by these differences in observed characteristics X. Interpretation The unexplained differential in wages for the same values of explanatory variables should not be interpreted as the amount of the difference in wages due only to discrimination. This is because other explanatory variables not included in the regression (e.g. because they are unobserved) may also account for wage differences. For example, David Card and Alan Krueger found in a paper entitled, \\"School Quality and Black-White Relative Earnings: A Direct Assessment\\" that improvements in the quality of schools for Black men born in the Southern states of the United States between 1915 and 1966 increased the return to education for these men, leading to narrowing of the black-white earnings gap. In terms of wage regressions, the poor quality of schools for Black men had meant a lower value of the Œ≤ coefficient on years of schooling for Black men than for White men. Thus, some of this lower Œ≤ coefficient reflected a difference in the quality of education for Black workers which could have otherwise interpreted as an effect of discrimination.
