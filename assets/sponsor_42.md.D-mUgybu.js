It was created in 1868 and bestowed upon James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Abercorn. Although the Dukedom is in the Peerage of Ireland, it refers to Abercorn, West Lothian, and the Duke also bears four titles in Peerage of Scotland and two in the Peerage of Great Britain, and is one of only three peers who have titles in those three peerages. The Duke of Abercorn also claims the French title of Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, created in 1548. History In acknowledgement of his loyalty, James VI of Scotland (James I of England), conferred on the Hon. Claud Hamilton, third son of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, the title Lord Paisley. His son James Hamilton was created Lord Abercorn on 5 April 1603, then on 10 July 1606 he was made Earl of Abercorn and Lord of Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastell and Kilpatrick. His successor, the 2nd Earl of Abercorn, was additionally created Lord Hamilton, Baron of Strabane, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 8 May 1617. He resigned this dignity to his younger brother in 1633; the brother's heirs inherited the Earldom and other titles in 1680, in the person of Claud Hamilton, 4th Earl of Abercorn. He was attainted in Ireland in 1691, and the Barony of Strabane forfeited, but his brother Charles Hamilton, 5th Earl of Abercorn, obtained a reversal of the attainder and recovered in 1692. The 6th earl was at his accession an Irish baronet, \\"of Dunalong in the County of Tyrone, and of Nenagh in the County of Tipperary\\" (1660). He was additionally created Baron Mountcastle and Viscount Strabane, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 2 September 1701. The 7th earl became the first of the Earls of Abercorn to be invested a Privy Counsellor, having been appointed to both the English and Irish Privy Councils. The 8th earl was created Viscount Hamilton, of Hamilton, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 24 August 1786. He was succeeded by his nephew, who was created Marquess of Abercorn in the Peerage of Great Britain on 15 October 1790, after having sat in the House of Commons as MP for East Looe and for St Germans. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1805. The 2nd Marquess, who had been given the Garter in 1844, served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1866 to 1868 (and again from 1874 to 1876); and on 10 August 1868, during his first term, he was created Marquess of Hamilton, of Strabane, and Duke of Abercorn (in the Peerage of Ireland). His successor, the 2nd Duke, continued the family tradition by being awarded the Garter in 1892; the 3rd Duke served as MP for Londonderry and as Governor of Northern Ireland, along with being created a Knight of St Patrick and given the Garter. Currently, the holder of the Dukedom is James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Abercorn, also a Knight of the Garter. Of the subsidiary titles above, Marquess of Hamilton is the courtesy title of the heir apparent, and Viscount Strabane that of his heir-apparent. The Dukes of Abercorn also claim the French title of Duc de Ch√¢tellerault, as heirs-male of the 2nd Earl of Arran, who was granted the title in 1548 by Henry II of France. Additionally, since the death of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, in 1651, the Earls, Marquesses, and Dukes of Abercorn have been the rightful claimants to the peerage dignities of Earl of Arran (of the 1503 creation) and Lord Hamilton (of the 1445 creation), both in the Peerage of Scotland, as the most senior heirs-male of James Hamilton, Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, and this title is reflected in their coat of arms, with an inescutcheon of three fleur-de-lys and a French ducal crown. Diana, Princess of Wales was a great-granddaughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn. The family seat is Baronscourt (usually known locally as Baronscourt Castle), a neo- Classical country house on the Barons Court Estate near Newtownstewart, Omagh, a village near Strabane, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

It is small bird, around long and weighing , with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail. Between 8 and 11 subspecies are recognised. Its close resemblance to the willow tit can cause identification problems, especially in the United Kingdom where the local subspecies of the two are very similar: they were not recognised as separate species until 1897. Globally, the marsh tit is classified as Least Concern, although there is evidence of a decline in numbers (in the UK, numbers have dropped by more than 50% since the 1970s, for example). It can be found throughout temperate Europe and northern Asia and, despite its name, it occurs in a range of habitats including dry woodland. The marsh tit is omnivorous; its food includes caterpillars, spiders and seeds. It nests in tree holes, choosing existing hollows to enlarge, rather than excavating its own. A clutch of 5‚Äì9 eggs is laid. Taxonomy and systematics  The marsh tit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Parus palustris. It is now placed in the genus Poecile that was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The genus name, Poecile, is the Ancient Greek name for a now unidentifiable small bird, and is perhaps derived from poikolos, meaning \\"spotted\\"; the specific palustris is Latin for \\"marshy\\". An analysis of mitochrondrial DNA sequences has shown that the marsh tit belongs to a group of Eurasian 'typical chickadees' that includes the willow tit, P√®re David's tit, the black-bibbed tit, and the Songar tit. Ten subspecies are recognised: * P. p. dresseri (Stejneger, 1886) ‚Äì central and southern England, Wales] and west France. Still present in the far south-east of Scotland but in small numbers.http://www.the-soc.org.uk/sbr.php Slightly smaller than palustris and more brown or olive-coloured on upperparts and dirtier below. Pale brown tertial fringes can sometimes cause confusion with willow tit * P. p. palustris (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì north and central Europe, from south Scandinavia south to north Iberia, east to central Poland, west Balkans and Greece * P. p. italicus (Tschusi & Hellmayr, 1900) ‚Äì French Alps, Italy and Sicily. As dresseri, but more rufous on upperparts and paler on underparts * P. p. stagnatilis (Brehm, CL, 1855) ‚Äì east Europe east to south Urals and northwest Turkey * P. p. kabardensis (Buturlin, 1929) ‚Äì Caucasus and northeast Turkey * P. p. brevirostris Taczanowski, 1872 ‚Äì south central & southeast Siberia, north Mongolia, northeast China and North Korea * P. p. ernsti (Yamashina, 1933) ‚Äì Sakhalin Island * P. p. hensoni (Stejneger, 1892) ‚Äì south Kuril Islands and Hokkaido, Japan * P. p. jeholicus (Kleinschmidt, O & Weigold, 1922) ‚Äì northeast China and North Korea * P. p. hellmayri Bianchi, 1903 ‚Äì east China and South Korea Description ringing showing pale 'cutting edges' to bill The nominate race has a black cap and nape with a blue sheen visible at close quarters. The black 'bib' below the bill is rather small; the cheeks are white, turning dusky brown on the ear coverts. The upperparts, tail and wings are greyish-brown, with slightly paler fringes to the tertials. The underparts are off-white with a buff or brown tinge strongest on the flanks and undertail coverts. The bill is black and the legs dark grey. Juveniles are very similar to adults, but with a duller black cap and bib, more greyish upperparts and paler underparts; they moult into adult plumage by September. The marsh tit weighs , has a length of (from bill to tail) and a wingspan of . The wing length ranges from . The oldest recorded marsh tit in Europe reached the age of 11 years, 11 months. Like other tits it has a large range of call notes; most typical is the explosive \\"pitchou\\" note, given when agitated, often leading into \\"pitchou-bee-bee-bee\\", which can sound like willow tit when not heard clearly. Unlike many other tits, however, the marsh tit has a well-defined song and a wide song repertoire. Individual birds can have more than five songs, which they use interchangeably. Some of the more common songs include a typical tit-like, ringing, \\"schip-schip-schip- schip-ship\\", a more liquid \\"tu-tu-tu-tu-tu\\" and sometimes a sweet \\"tyeu-tyeu- tyeu-tyeu-tyeu\\". The old Staffordshire name for the species, 'Saw Whetter', refers to the bird's scolding call. Note the glossy cap, smaller bib and uniform wings which help distinguish it from the willow tit. Marsh and willow tits are difficult to distinguish on appearance alone; the races occurring in the UK (P. p. dresseri and P. m. kleinschmidti respectively) are especially hard to separate. When caught for ringing, the pale 'cutting edge' of the marsh tit's bill is a reliable criterion; otherwise, the best way to tell apart the two species is by voice. Plumage characteristics include the lack of a pale wing panel (formed by pale edges to the secondary feathers in the willow tit), the marsh tit's glossier black cap and smaller black 'bib', although none of these is 'completely reliable'; for example, juvenile marsh tits can show a pale wing panel. The marsh tit has a noticeably smaller and shorter head than the willow tit and overall the markings are crisp and neat, with the head in proportion to the rest of the bird (willow tit gives the impression of being 'bull-necked'). A measure of the difficulty in identification is given by the fact that, in the UK, the willow tit was not identified as distinct from marsh tit until 1897. Two German ornithologists, Ernst Hartert and Otto Kleinschmidt, were studying marsh tit skins at the British Museum and found two wrongly-labelled willow tits amongst them (two willow tit specimens were then collected at Coalfall Wood in Finchley, north London, and that species was added to the British list in 1900). Distribution and habitat Typical marsh tit habitat in Northamptonshire, England.The marsh tit has a worldwide Extent of Occurrence of around 10 million square kilometres. The global population includes between 6.1 million and 12 million birds in Europe alone. The species is classified as Least Concern, though there is some evidence of a decline in numbers. For example, between the 1970s and 2007, marsh tit numbers declined in the United Kingdom by more than 50% and consequently it is on the Red List of species compiled by the UK's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Research suggests that the cause may be low survival rates from year to year, though the nest failure rate has fallen during the decline. Other studies have shown that reduced diversity of woodland structure and plant species, partly because of the impact of deer browsing, is the cause of the bird's decline. Data from 157 woodlands covered by the RSPB/BTO Repeat Woodland Bird Survey showed that the abundance of marsh tits in 2003‚Äì2004 corresponded with the vegetation present 2‚Äì4 metres above the ground, the shrub layer. Data from the 1980s did not show the same results, but marsh tit numbers had increased by 2003‚Äì2004 in woods with the most shrub cover. The study concluded that damage to the shrub layer, caused by overgrazing by deer, for example, may make woodland less suitable for marsh tits. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate Europe and northern Asia. It occurs from northern Spain north to south-eastern Scotland and east to western Russia, with a broad gap in western Asia and present again in eastern Asia from the Altai Mountains east to northern Japan and northern and western China. This species is sedentary, making short post- breeding movements in most of its range, but in northern Europe some move southward in winter. However, marsh tits seem not to perform the occasional irruptions that other members of the tit family do. Most marsh tits stay in their breeding territories year-round; presumably this is related to their food-storing strategy. Analysis of UK ringing data showed that of 108 recoveries (when a ringed bird is found dead or caught by another ringer), 85% were less than 5 km from where the bird was originally caught, and only 1% further than 20 km. Young birds join mixed roaming flocks; adults also join the flocks when they pass through, but do not stray from their territory. Marsh tits breed mostly in lowland areas, but can reach altitudes of up to 1,300 m. They prefer large areas of moist, broadleaved woodland, often oak or beech, though they can occupy wet alder woodland, riverside trees, parks and gardens or orchards. A study at Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire, England, found that marsh tits required mature trees with a shrub layer below the canopy, but that they avoided parts of the wood with many young trees. Retrieved 25 January 2009 Another study in the United Kingdom found that during winter and while foraging, marsh tits spent more time than blue tits in the wood's understorey, and more time lower in the woodland canopy and understorey. Trees and shrubs in 10 breeding territories were also compared. The trees varied significantly between territories, but the shrub characteristics did not, suggesting that the shrubs were more important to the birds. In Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, marsh tits were \\"largely absent\\" from parts of the wood with a dense canopy but poor shrub cover. Behaviour and ecology In mixed winter tit flocks, seldom more than one or two marsh tits are present, and parties of this species alone are infrequent. Its performances in the bushes and branches are just as neat and agile as those of other tits; it often hangs upside down by one leg. =Breeding= Marsh tits are monogamous and often pair for life; one pair stayed together for six years. In Europe, hybridisation with the willow tit has been recorded twice. The nest site is in a hole, usually in a tree but sometimes in a wall or in the ground. Nestboxes may be used. Old willow tit holes may be used and enlarged further. Marsh tits do not usually excavate their own nest holes, though they may enlarge the hollow, carrying the chips to a distance before dropping them. The hole may be within a centimetres or two of the ground or high as . Inside the hole, a nest of moss is made and lined with hair and sometimes a few feathers; of moss is used in damp holes, but much less in dry ones. Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Between five and nine white and red-speckled eggs are laid late in April or in May, measuring and weighing each, of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female for 14‚Äì16 days; incubation begins before the clutch is complete, meaning that the chicks hatch over a period of around two days. She sits closely and gives a typical tit \\"hissing display\\" if disturbed. The male helps to feed and care for the young and brings nearly all the food for the first four days after hatching. The altricial, downy chicks fledge after 18‚Äì21 days. The fledglings are fed by their parents for a week and become independent after a further 1‚Äì7 days. The family stays together for between 11‚Äì15 days after the first flights of the juveniles. Second broods have been recorded, though they are extremely rare in Britain; most are replacement clutches. A study of marsh tits in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, Poland, looked at which factors affected birds' choice to re-occupy a nest hole used the previous year. It found that 35.5% of available holes were used again the following year, and that holes where a brood had failed were less likely to be re-used. A study in Bourton Woods, Gloucestershire, England, found that nestboxes were used by marsh tits in successive years in only 20% of cases. =Food and feeding= Mostly spiders and insects are eaten in spring and summer, but seeds ‚Äì including those of the thistle ‚Äì nuts and berries are taken in autumn and winter. Beechmast is the preferred food when it can be found. Marsh tits often take seeds and fruit from the plant before taking them to eat elsewhere. Marsh tits collect and store large numbers of seeds. For a study in Norway, birds were watched for two hours 15 minutes. They ate 43 and cached 83 seeds per hour. In Sweden, storing food is most frequent between September and late February, with the peak in this behaviour occurring from September to October. Hiding places for the seeds include on and in the ground, in leaf litter, in tree stumps, and under moss and lichen in trees. The hidden seeds are prone to being stolen, by other marsh tits or other species, so birds often fly from one site to another before deciding on a hiding place. They tend to retrieve the oldest items first, and memorise their location rather than searching randomly or checking systematically. The marsh tit's hippocampus is 31% bigger than that of the great tit, despite the great tit's larger overall size and larger forebrain; the relative volume of this part of the brain is greater in birds that cache food.

It descends about from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf and is bordered by the Commonwealth Range of the Queen Maud Mountains on the eastern side and the Queen Alexandra Range of the Central Transantarctic Mountains on the western. The glacier is one of the main passages through the Transantarctic Mountains to the great polar plateau beyond, and was one of the early routes to the South Pole despite its steep upward incline. The glacier was discovered and climbed by Ernest Shackleton during his Nimrod Expedition of 1908.

However, they reached the pole a month after Roald Amundsen and his team, who had chosen a route up the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier.

It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout the temperate to subtropical Palearctic including North Africa. The black-crested tit is now usually included in this species. There are a few subspecies of the coal tit, those being the British, North African and continental ones. They are most commonly found throughout Europe and Russia in coniferous forests and trees. Taxonomy and systematics This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Linnaeus' primary reference was his earlier Fauna Svecica, whose cumbersome pre-binomial name Parus capite nigro: vertice albo, dorso cinereo, pectore albo (\\"black- headed tit with white nape, ash-grey back, white breast\\") became the much simpler yet no less unequivocal Parus ater. This name ‚Äì meaning \\"dusky-black tit\\" ‚Äì was simply adopted from older ornithological textbooks, ultimately going back to Conrad Gessner's 1555 Historia animalium. He gave no type locality except \\"Europe\\", but his original description refers to the population inhabiting Sweden (which is consequently included in the nominate subspecies today).Gessner (1555): pp.616, Linnaeus (1746, 1758) The current genus name, is Ancient Greek peri plus the pre-existing genus Parus. The specific ater is Latin for \\"dull black\\". The colourful great tit (Parus major) with its bold wing-stripe. Before binomial nomenclature, naturalists found the folk taxonomy of this species and the coal tit quite confusing. Gessner also notes that the coal tit was known as Kohlmei√ü in German ‚Äì the literal equivalent of its English name, though in its modern orthography Kohlmeise it refers to the great tit (Parus major). That bird was in Gessner's day usually called Spiegelmei√ü (\\"multicoloured tit\\"Literally \\"mirror tit\\" (though its feathers are not iridescent), perhaps rather \\"wing-stripe tit\\", as in German ornithology Spiegel means a wing-stripe or -patch. The interpretation referring to its colorful plumage, though somewhat unusual, is the one given by Gesner however: a colorum pulchritudine quibus distinguitur ‚Äì \\"for the beauty of its colors, which distinguish it\\"), Brandtmei√ü (\\"burnt tit\\") or grosse Mei√ü (\\"great tit\\") in German. K√∂lmey√ü was attested for P. major by William Turner, but Turner does not list P. ater at all, while Gessner notes that his hunters always used Kohlmei√ü for the present species. However, this has since changed, and the modern German name of P. ater is Tannenmeise (\\"fir tit\\"), after a typical habitat. This name is attested (as Tannen-Maise) by Johann Leonhard Frisch in the early 18th century already, who furthermore records that P. ater was also called Kleine Kohl-Maise (\\"small coal tit\\") whereas Kohl-Maise referred unequivocally to P. major. Frisch collected his data in the Berlin region, where the German dialect was quite different from that spoken by Gessner's Alemannic sources 200 years earlier, and heavily influenced by Middle Low German ‚Äì the language of the northern German sources of Turner. Regarding that, Tanne is derived from the Old Saxon danna, and thus had spread through the German dialect continuum from north to south. Turner (1544a,b), Gessner (1555): pp.615‚Äì616, Frisch (1720), Linnaeus (1758) Most authorities still treat the coal tit in the subgenus Periparus, but the American Ornithologists' Union considers Periparus a distinct genus. This is supported by mtDNA cytochrome b sequence analysis; Periparus seems to be closer to the Poecile tits and chickadees than to the great tit and its relatives. Thus, it belongs to the more advanced Paridae, in which the bright plumage of the more basal lineages is dulled down apomorphically.Gill et al. (2005) Illustration of Parus ater cypriotes by John Gerrard Keulemans In addition, the same data suggest that this species is paraphyletic in regard to the closely related and parapatric spot-winged tit (P. melanolophus) from South Asia, which looks like a slightly crested, darker version of P. ater. Consequently, the spot-winged tit might have to be included in P. ater, or some coal tits could be considered a distinct species. As occasional hybridization has been recorded between the two, mtDNA alone (which is inherited only from the mother) is insufficient to determine whether hybrid gene flow or another trivial cause (such as incomplete lineage sorting) obfuscates the actual relationships, or whether taxonomic rearrangement is indeed required. With the range of these titmice encircling the Himalayas, without further study it cannot even be excluded that they constitute a ring species ‚Äì with gene flow occurring in Nepal but not in Afghanistan ‚Äì as has been shown for other passerines in the same region. =Subspecies= Adult continental coal tit, P. a. ater (note blue-grey back) A number of coal tit subspecies are distinguished. The differences in colouration are quite pronounced in some of them, while their differences in size are more subtle. Coal tits from Asia follow Bergmann's rule, being larger in colder regions; those from further west, however, do not, as the birds from the uplands around the Mediterranean are larger than those from northern Europe. Across its range, tail length in relation to body length increases along a cline running from southwest to northeast.Snow (1954) The British race P. a. britannicus has an olive hue to its brownish-grey back plumage, distinguishing it from the continental European nominate subspecies P. a. ater and P. a. abietum in which the back is bluish grey without a hint of green or brown. The Irish race P. a. hibernicus is distinguished from britannicus by the pale sulphur-yellow cheeks, breast and belly. It also has a paler rump (due to light fringes of the uppertail coverts) and a larger bill than its relatives from Britain and the Continent.BI [2009] The North African race P. a. ledouci has yellow underparts and cheeks, and the Cypriot P. a. cypriotes has a buff tinge to its upper parts, and deep buff underparts. Asian subspecies are generally rather dusky brownish except for the black-and-white head; they include among others P. a. michalowskii of the Caucasus, P. a. phaeonotus of Iran, or the Himalayan coal titBangs (1932) P. a. aemodius of southwestern China. Description Periparus ater filmed in Tokyo, Japan The coal tit is 10‚Äì11.5 cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on subspecies) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the wing coverts appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and irides dark brown. The young birds are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow. While searching for food, coal tit flocks keep contact with incessant short dee or see-see calls. The species' song ‚Äì if \\"song\\" it can be called ‚Äì is a strident if-he, if-he, if-he, heard most frequently from January to June, but also in autumn. The song resembles that of the great tit, but much faster and higher in pitch.A Field Guide to the Birds of Korea (2005). One variant of this song ends with a sharp ichi. North African birds also have a ' call similar to that of the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) which is not found in Africa. Adult, presumably Irish coal tit, P. a. hibernicus (note yellowish cheeks and breast) Behaviour and ecology Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden It is typically a bird of temperate humid conifer forest, but apart from that shows little habitat specificity. In Bhutan for example coal tits are fairly common residents above the subtropical zone, at about 3,000‚Äì3,800 m ASL, and are found in forests dominated by Bhutan fir (Abies densa) as well as in those characterized by Himalayan hemlock (Tsuga dumosa) and rhododendrons.Inskipp et al. (2000) The coal tit is an all-year resident throughout almost all range, making only local movements in response to particularly severe weather; only the Siberian birds have a more regular migration. Very rarely, vagrants may cross longer distances; for example the nominate subspecies of continental Europe was recorded in Ireland once in 1960 and once before that, but apparently not since then. Coal tits will form small flocks in winter with other tits. This species resembles other tits in acrobatic skill and restless activity, though it more frequently pitches on a trunk, and in little hops resembles a treecreeper (Certhia). Its food is similar to that of the others; it is keen on beechmast, picks out the seeds from fir (Abies) and larch (Larix) cones, and joins Carduelis redpolls and siskins in alders (Alnus) and birches (Betula). It will also visit gardens to feed on a variety of foods put out, particularly sunflower seeds. Coal tits in the laboratory prefer to forage at a variable feeding site when they are in a negative energy budget. They increase evening body mass in response to tawny owl calls. After dawn the coal tits increases body mass as soon as possible if food is obtained at a low rate, increasing body mass exponentially until an inflection point when the increase of body mass is slower. The inflection point of the body mass trajectory is 16.7% delayed compared to a high food availability. Subordinate coal tits are excluded from feeding sites by dominants more often in the early morning than in the rest of the day, and they showed more variability in daily mass gain and body mass at dawn than dominant coal tits. Being common and widespread, the coal tit is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.BLI (2009) The coal tit has the dubious distinction of having the largest number of bird fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) reported from a single nest, 5,754 fleas.  Breeding  A favourite nesting site is a hole in a rotting tree-stump, often low down, and the nest is deep within the hole; holes in the ground, burrows of mice or rabbits, chinks between the stones in walls, old nests of Pica magpies or other large birds, and squirrel dreys are also occupied. The materials, moss, hair and grass, are closely felted together, and rabbit fur or feathers added for lining. Seven to eleven red-spotted white eggs are laid, usually in May; this species breeds usually once per year.

It is several hundred metres thick. The nearly vertical ice front to the open sea is more than long, and between high above the water surface. Ninety percent of the floating ice, however, is below the water surface. Most of Ross Ice Shelf is in the Ross Dependency claimed by New Zealand. It floats in, and covers, a large southern portion of the Ross Sea and the entire Roosevelt Island located in the west of the Ross Sea. The ice shelf is named after Sir James Clark Ross, who discovered it on 28 January 1841. It was originally called \\"The Barrier\\", with various adjectives including \\"Great Ice Barrier\\", as it prevented sailing further south. Ross mapped the ice front eastward to 160¬∞ W. In 1947, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names applied the name \\"Ross Shelf Ice\\" to this feature and published it in the original U.S. Antarctic Gazetteer. In January 1953, the name was changed to \\"Ross Ice Shelf\\"; that name was published in 1956.1) [Bertrand, Kenneth John, et al, ed.] The Geographical Names of Antarctica. Special Publication No. 86. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Board on Geographical Names, May 1947. 2) [Bertrand, Kenneth J. and Fred G. Alberts]. Gazetteer No. 14. Geographic Names of Antarctica. Washington: US Government Printing Office, January 1956. Exploration Crevasse, Ross Ice Shelf in 2001. On January 5, 1841, the British Admiralty's Ross expedition in the Erebus and the Terror, three-masted ships with specially strengthened wooden hulls, was going through the pack ice of the Pacific near Antarctica in an attempt to determine the position of the South Magnetic Pole. Four days later, they found their way into open water and were hoping that they would have a clear passage to their destination. But on 11 January, the men were faced with an enormous mass of ice. Sir James Clark Ross, the expedition's commander, remarked: \\"Well, there's no more chance of sailing through that than through the cliffs of Dover\\". Ross, who in 1831 had located the North Magnetic Pole, spent the next two years vainly searching for a sea passage to the South Pole; later, his name was given to the ice shelf and the sea surrounding it. Two volcanoes in the region were named by Ross for his vessels. For late Antarctic explorers seeking to reach the South Pole, the Ross Ice Shelf became a starting area. In a first exploration of the area by the Discovery Expedition in 1901-1904, Robert Falcon Scott made a significant study of the shelf and its surroundings from his expedition's base on Ross Island. By measurement of calved ice bergs and their buoyancy, he estimated the ice sheet to be on average 274 meters thick; the undisturbed morphology of the ice sheet and its inverted temperature profile led him to conclude it was floating on water; and measurements in 1902-1903 showed it had advanced 555 meters northwards in 13.5 months.R.F. Scott (1905) The voyage of the Discovery. Vol II, pp411-421 Smith, Elder and Co, London, p411 The findings were presented at a lecture entitled \\"Universitas Antarctica!\\" given 7 June 1911 and were published in the account of Scott's second expedition (the Terra Nova Expedition of 1910-1913).Scott, Robert and Leonard Huxley. Scott's Last Expedition in Two Volumes: Vol. II. New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1913. \\"The mystic Barrier\\" at Bay of Whales, near where Amundsen first encountered it Note humans for size comparison (dark spots next to the large chunk of sea ice at left image border) Ernest Shackleton's southern party (Shackleton, Adams, Marshal, Wild) of the 1908 Nimrod expedition were the first humans to cross the Ice Shelf during its failed attempt to reach the South Pole. Both Roald Amundsen and Scott crossed the shelf to reach the Pole in 1911. Amundsen wrote: \\"Along its outer edge the Barrier shows an even, flat surface; but here, inside the bay, the conditions were entirely different. Even from the deck of the Fram we were able to observe great disturbances of the surface in every direction; huge ridges with hollows between them extended on all sides. The greatest elevation lay to the south in the form of a lofty, arched ridge, which we took to be about high on the horizon. But it might be assumed that this ridge continued to rise beyond the range of vision\\". The next day, the party made its first steps on the Barrier. \\"After half an hour‚Äôs march we were already at the first important point--the connection between the sea-ice and the Barrier. This connection had always haunted our brains. What would it be like? A high, perpendicular face of ice, up which we should have to haul our things laboriously with the help of tackles? Or a great and dangerous fissure, which we should not be able to cross without going a long way round? We naturally expected something of the sort. This mighty and terrible monster would, of course, offer resistance in some form or other,\\" he wrote. \\"The mystic Barrier! All accounts without exception, from the days of Ross to the present time, had spoken of this remarkable natural formation with apprehensive awe. It was as though one could always read between the lines the same sentence: 'Hush, be quiet! the mystic Barrier!' \\"One, two, three, and a little jump, and the Barrier was surmounted!\\" (Translated from the Norwegian by A. G. Chater) Composition and movement Ross Ice Shelf edge in 1997 Ice shelves are thick plates of ice, formed continuously by glaciers, that float atop an ocean. The presence of the shelves acts as \\"brakes\\" for the glaciers. These shelves serve another important purpose -- \\"they moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers' surfaces. Once their ice shelves are removed, the glaciers increase in speed due to meltwater percolation and/or a reduction of braking forces, and they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments. Glacier ice speed increases are already observed in Peninsula areas where ice shelves disintegrated in prior years.\\" The Ross Ice Shelf is one of many such shelves. It reaches into Antarctica from the north, and covers an area of about , nearly the size of France. The ice mass is about wide and long. In some places, namely its southern areas, the ice shelf can be almost 750 m (2,450 ft) thick. The Ross Ice Shelf pushes out into the sea at between a day. Other glaciers gradually add bulk to it. At the same time, the freezing of seawater below the ice mass increases the thickness of the ice from . Sometimes, fissures and cracks may cause part of the shelf to break off; the largest known is about , that is, slightly larger than Belgium. Iceberg B-15, the world's largest recorded iceberg, was calved from the Ross Ice Shelf during March 2000. Scientists have long been intrigued by the shelf and its composition. Many scientific teams researching the Antarctic have made camps on or adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf. This includes McMurdo Station. One major effort was a series of studies conducted in 1957 and 1958, which were continued during the 1960‚Äì61 season. The efforts involved an international team of scientists. Some parties explored the glaciers and others the valleys on the ice shelf. From 1967 to 1972 the Scott Polar Research Institute reported extensive observations using radio echo sounding. The technique allowed measurements to be taken from the air; allowing a criss cross track of 35,000 km to be covered; compared with a 3,000 km track from previous seismic sounding on the ground.Nature-Times News Service; Science report Glaciology: Ross ice shelf flow; The Times; 28 January 1975; p. 12 More detailed surveys were executed between 1973 and 1978. A significant scientific endeavor called the Ross Ice Shelf Project was launched with a plan of drilling into the shelf to sample the biomass in the area and make other determinations about the shelf and its relationship to the sea floor. The project included surface glaciological observations as well as drilling, and the glaciological portion started during the planning phase of the drilling. The drilling portion of the project was to have begun during 1974, but the actual drilling was delayed until 1976. Finally, in 1977, the scientists were able to drill successfully through the ice, making a hole that could be sampled every few days for three weeks. The team was able to map the sea floor, study the tides, and assess the fish and various other forms of life in the waters. The team also examined the oceanographic and geological conditions as well as the temperature of the ice. They estimated that the base of the shelf was ‚àí2.16¬∞ Celsius (27.3 ¬∞F). They also made other calculations about the fluctuations of the temperatures. The results of these various projects were published in a series of reports in the 2 February 1979 issue of Science. During the 1980s, a network of weather stations was installed to record temperatures on the shelf and throughout the more remote parts of the continent. Glacier-ice shelf interactions University of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center has been studying ice shelves and, in 2002, announced that, based on several breakups of ice shelves, including Larsen B, has begun to reassess their stability. Their scientists stated that the temperature of the warmest portion of the shelf is \\"only a few degrees too cool in summer presently to undergo the same kind of retreat process. The Ross Ice Shelf is the main outlet for several major glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which contains the equivalent of 5 m of sea level rise in its above-sea-level ice.\\" The report added that observations of \\"iceberg calving\\" on the Ross Ice Shelf are, in their opinion, unrelated to its stability. Scientific exploration continues to uncover interesting information and the analyses have resulted in some interesting theories being posited and publicized. One such opinion, given in 2006 based on a geological survey, suggested that the ice shelf had collapsed previously, perhaps suddenly, which could well happen again. Main drill site for the New Zealand 2017 hot water drill camp on the Ross Ice Shelf A science team from New Zealand installed a camp in the centre of the shelf in late 2017. The expedition was led by glaciologist Christina Hulbe and brought together oceanographers, glaciologists, biologists and sedimentologists to examine the ice, ocean and sediment in the central shelf region. One of the key findings was that the ice in the region was re-freezing. This re-freezing and growth of an ice shelf is not uncommon but the Ross Ice Shelf situation appeared to be very variable as there was no evidence of long-term freezing.

Options and futures are by far the most common equity derivatives, however there are many other types of equity derivatives that are actively traded. Equity options Equity options are the most common type of equity derivative.Investopedia.com‚ÄîEquity derivatives They provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of stock (1 contract = 100 shares of stock), at a set price (strike price), within a certain period of time (prior to the expiration date). Warrants In finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy stock of the company that issued it at a specified price, which is much lower than the stock price at time of issue. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower interest rates or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers. Convertible bonds Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre- announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It can be used by investors to obtain the upside of equity-like returns while protecting the downside with regular bond-like coupons. Equity futures, options and swaps Investors can gain exposure to the equity markets using futures, options and swaps. These can be done on single stocks, a customized basket of stocks or on an index of stocks. These equity derivatives derive their value from the price of the underlying stock or stocks. =Stock market index futures= Stock markets index futures are futures contracts used to replicate the performance of an underlying stock market index. They can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the index. Indices for futures include well-established indices such as S&P; 500, FTSE 100, DAX, CAC 40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility. =Equity basket derivatives= Equity basket derivatives are futures, options or swaps where the underlying is a non-index basket of shares. They have similar characteristics to equity index derivatives, but are always traded OTC (over the counter, i.e. between established institutional investors), as the basket definition is not standardized in the way that an equity index is. These are used normally for correlation trading. =Single-stock futures= Single-stock futures are exchange-traded futures contracts based on an individual underlying security rather than a stock index. Their performance is similar to that of the underlying equity itself, although as futures contracts they are usually traded with greater leverage. Another difference is that holders of long positions in single stock futures typically do not receive dividends and holders of short positions do not pay dividends. Single-stock futures may be cash-settled or physically settled by the transfer of the underlying stocks at expiration, although in the United States only physical settlement is used to avoid speculation in the market. =Equity index swaps= An equity index swap is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows on predetermined dates for an agreed number of years. The cash flows will be an equity index value swapped, for instance, with. Swaps can be considered a relatively straightforward way of gaining exposure to a required asset class. They can also be relatively cost efficient. =Equity swap= An equity swap is an exchange of future cash flows between two parties that allows each party to diversify its income for a specified period of time while still holding its original assets. The two sets of nominally equal cash flows are exchanged as per the terms of the swap, which may involve an equity-based cash flow (such as from a stock asset) that is traded for a fixed-income cash flow (such as a benchmark rate), but this is not necessarily the case. Besides diversification and tax benefits, equity swaps also allow large institutions to hedge specific assets or positions in their portfolios.

It was introduced as part of the so-called Vision 95 (Armeeleitbild 95) reform package. Anyone who is unable to do compulsory military service for reasons of conscience can submit an application to perform civilian service instead. Formerly, the applicant was then forced to attend a hearing where they had to explain their reasons for refusal. Now, they must take part in a one-day introductory session to civilian service within three months of submitting their application. If one is unfit to serve in the military because of physical or psychological impairments, he is also deemed unfit for civilian service, even if the impairments do not render the individual unable to fulfill a specific task related to the civilian service. This is true, for example, for a disabled person in a wheelchair who is perfectly able to work in the administration of a nursing home. Unless they have very severe handicaps such as mental illness, men are excused or declared unfit to serve in the military are forced to pay a substitute fee of about 3 percent of their yearly income until the age of 37, when military servicemen are normally released from further service. Women are also allowed to serve in the civilian service or in the armed forces except in combat missions. Women serve voluntarily. In 2005, the Swiss Federal Assembly began to discuss if the \\"state of conscience hearings\\" should be abolished and if the willingness to serve a longer time (see below) should be the only criterion, citing the large administrative costs for judging the cases of just a few thousand applicants per year. The high rate of young people opting to serve in the alternative service has also created organizational problems. On the other hand, the civilian service option under the Vision 95 reform package has increased the rate of approval of the public, particularly the young segment of the population, for the existence of the Swiss armed forces.  Civilian service  Once part of the civilian service program, one has to work 50 percent longer than the total normal cumulative military service period. Full cumulative military service for normal soldiers is currently 260 days, while full civilian service is 340 days. Many nonprofit organizations are licensed to employ civilian service workers. Unlike the former Civilian Service in Germany, where the servants did their work mainly in hospitals and healthcare sites, Swiss ones can apply for work in a broad variety of opportunities: health care, welfare, environmental protection, agriculture (small or alpine farms), research projects, and development assistance abroad. Civilian servicemen must have the appropriate skills for each type of assignment ‚Äì for example, because there are very few job vacancies in development aid. A big difference between civilian and military service is that civilian service participants can greatly profit from his substitute service ‚Äì in terms of work experience ‚Äì to achieve a better position after the service, although it is formally not allowed to do civilian service with, for example, the goal of passing an exam in mind. So, during civilian service in a research institute, one must not write personal academic papers to be submitted at a later time. There are still issues with how to handle Swiss living abroad who have already passed recruitment and are already members of the Swiss militia army. In this case, they are not exempt from military service or civilian service, and every step of the application process requires their presence in Switzerland.

The work is believed to have been crafted in 1345 B.C. by Thutmose because it was found in his workshop in Amarna, Egypt. It is one of the most copied works of ancient Egypt. Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world and an icon of feminine beauty. A German archaeological team led by Ludwig Borchardt discovered the bust in 1912 in Thutmose's workshop. It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery, including the cellar of a bank, a salt mine in Merkers-Kieselbach, the Dahlem museum, the Egyptian Museum in Charlottenburg and the Altes Museum. It is currently on display at the Neues Museum in Berlin, where it was originally displayed before World War II. The Nefertiti bust has become a cultural symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. It has also been the subject of an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation, which began in 1924 once the bust was first displayed to the public. Egyptian inspectors were not shown the actual bust before they let it out of the country. History =Background= A \\"house altar\\" () depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti and three of their daughters. Note Nefertiti wears a crown similar to that depicted on the bust. Nefertiti (meaning \\"the beautiful one has come forth\\") was the 14th- century BC Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called Atenism dedicated to the Sun disc Aten. Little is known about Nefertiti. Theories suggest she could have been an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named Ay, who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352 BC to 1336 BC. Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten, one of whom, Ankhesenpaaten (renamed Ankhesenamun after the suppression of the Aten cult), married Tutankhamun, Nefertiti's stepson. While it was once thought that Nefertiti disappeared in the twelfth year of Akhenaten's reign because of her death or because she took a new name, she was still alive in the sixteenth year of her husband's reign according to a limestone quarry inscription found at Dayr Ab≈´ ·∏§innisAthena van der Perre, The Year 16 graffito of Akhenaten in Dayr Ab≈´ ·∏§innis. A Contribution to the Study of the Later Years of Nefertiti, Journal of Egyptian History (JEH) 7 (2014), pp.67-108 \\"on the eastern side of the Nile, about ten kilometres north of Amarna.\\"A. Van der Perre, 'Nefertiti's last documented reference for now' F. Seyfried (ed.), In the Light of Amarna. 100 Years of the Nefertiti Discovery, (Berlin, 2012), pp.195-197 (academia.edu) Nefertiti may have become a pharaoh in her own right for a short time after her husband's death.Silverman, Wegner, Wegner pp.130-33 The bust of Nefertiti is believed to have been crafted about 1345 BC by the sculptor Thutmose. The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the \\"house altar\\". =Discovery= Nefertiti bust The bust was found on 6 December 1912 at Amarna by the German Oriental Company (Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft ‚Äì DOG), led by German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt. It was found in what had been the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose, along with other unfinished busts of Nefertiti.Siehr p.115 Borchardt's diary provides the main written account of the find; he remarks, \\"Suddenly we had in our hands the most alive Egyptian artwork. You cannot describe it with words. You must see it.\\" A 1924 document found in the archives of the German Oriental Company recalls a 20 January 1913 meeting between Borchardt and a senior Egyptian official to discuss the division of the archeological finds of 1912 between Germany and Egypt. According to the secretary of the German Oriental Company (who was the author of the document and who was present at the meeting), Borchardt \\"wanted to save the bust for us\\". Borchardt is suspected of having concealed the bust's real value, although he denied doing so.Berger p. 288 While Philipp Vandenberg describes the coup as \\"adventurous and beyond comparison\\",Breger p. 286 Time magazine lists it among the \\"Top 10 Plundered Artifacts\\". Borchardt showed the Egyptian official a photograph of the bust \\"that didn't show Nefertiti in her best light\\". The bust was wrapped up in a box when Egypt's chief antiques inspector, Gustave Lefebvre, came for inspection. The document reveals that Borchardt claimed the bust was made of gypsum to mislead Lefebvre. The German Oriental Company blames the negligence of Lefebvre and points out that the bust was at the top of the exchange list and says the deal was done fairly. Description and examinations The bust is tall and weighs about . It is made of a limestone core covered with painted stucco layers. The face is completely symmetrical and almost intact, but the left eye lacks the inlay present in the right. The pupil of the right eye is of inserted quartz with black paint and is fixed with beeswax. The background of the eye-socket is unadorned limestone. Nefertiti wears her characteristic blue crown known as the \\"Nefertiti cap crown\\" with a golden diadem band looped around like horizontal ribbons and joining at the back, and an Uraeus (cobra), which is now broken, over her brow. She also wears a broad collar with a floral pattern. The ears have suffered some damage. Gardner's Art Through the Ages suggests that \\"With this elegant bust, Thutmose may have been alluding to a heavy flower on its slender sleek stalk by exaggerating the weight of the crowned head and the length of the almost serpentine neck.\\" According to David Silverman, the bust reflects the classical Egyptian art style, deviating from the \\"eccentricities\\" of the Amarna art style, which was developed in Akhenaten's reign. The exact function of the bust is unknown, though it is theorized that the bust may be a sculptor's modello to be used as a basis for other official portraits, kept in the artist's workshop. =Colours= Borchardt commissioned a chemical analysis of the coloured pigments of the head. The result of the examination was published in the book Portrait of Queen Nofretete in 1923: * Blue: powdered frit, coloured with copper oxide * Skin colour (light red): fine powdered lime spar colored with red chalk (iron oxide) * Yellow: orpiment (arsenic sulfide) * Green: powdered frit, coloured with copper and iron oxide * Black: coal with wax as a binding medium * White: chalk =Missing left eye= When the bust was first discovered, no quartz to represent the iris of the left eyeball was present as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of ¬£1000 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris had fallen out when Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin.Joyce A. Tyldesley, Nefertiti: Egypt's sun queen, Viking, 1999, p.196. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection and lost her left eye, though the presence of an iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.Fred Gladstone Bratton, A history of Egyptian archaeology, Hale, 1968, p.223 Dietrich Wildung proposed that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and was used by the master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman present a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished.Silverman, Wegner, Wegner pp. 21, 113 Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, suggested that Thutmose created the left eye, but that it was later destroyed. =CT scans= The bust was first CT scanned in 1992, with the scan producing cross sections of the bust every .For comparative analysis between 1992 and 2006 CT scans: In 2006, Dietrich Wildung, director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum, while trying a different lighting at the Altes Museum, where the bust was then displayed, observed wrinkles on Nefertiti's neck and bags under her eyes, suggesting the sculptor had tried to depict signs of aging. A CT scan confirmed Wildung's findings; Thutmose had added gypsum under the cheeks and eyes in an attempt to perfect his sculpture. The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, director of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009's Radiology. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases around her mouth and cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose are leveled by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect \\"aesthetic ideals of the era\\". The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just under the stucco. Later history The bust has become \\"one of the most admired, and most copied, images from ancient Egypt\\", and the star exhibit used to market Berlin's museums. It is seen as an \\"icon of international beauty.\\" \\"Showing a woman with a long neck, elegantly arched brows, high cheekbones, a slender nose and an enigmatic smile played about red lips, the bust has established Nefertiti as one of the most beautiful faces of antiquity.\\" It is described as the most famous bust of ancient art, comparable only to the mask of Tutankhamun. Nefertiti has become an icon of Berlin's culture. Some 500,000 visitors see her every year. The bust is described as \\"the best-known work of art from ancient Egypt, arguably from all antiquity\\".Siehr p.114 Her face is on postcards of Berlin and 1989 German postage stamps. =Locations in Germany= Neues Museum, Berlin is the present location of the Nefertiti bust The bust has been in Germany since 1913, when it was shipped to Berlin and presented to James Simon, a wholesale merchant and the sponsor of the Amarna excavation. It was displayed at Simon's residence until 1913, when Simon lent the bust and other artifacts from the Amarna dig to the Berlin Museum. Although the rest of the Amarna collection was displayed in 1913‚Äì14, the bust was kept secret at Borchardt's request. In 1918, the museum discussed the public display of the bust, but again kept it secret at the request of Borchardt. It was permanently donated to the museum in 1920. In 1923, the bust was revealed to the public in Borchardt's writings; in 1924, it was displayed to the public as part of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. The bust created a sensation, swiftly becoming a world-renowned icon of feminine beauty and one of the most universally recognised artifacts to survive from Ancient Egypt. The bust was displayed in Berlin's Neues Museum on Museum Island until the museum was closed in 1939; with the onset of World War II, Berlin museums were emptied and artifacts moved to secure shelters for safekeeping. Initially stored in the cellar of the Prussian Governmental Bank, the bust was moved in the autumn of 1941 to the tower of a flak bunker in Berlin. The Neues Museum suffered bombings in 1943 by the Royal Air Force. On 6 March 1945, the bust was moved to a German salt mine at Merkers-Kieselbach in Thuringia. In March 1945, the bust was found by the American Army and given over to its Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives branch. It was moved to the Reichsbank in Frankfurt and shipped in August to the U.S. Central Collecting Point in Wiesbaden, where it was put on public display beginning in 1946. It remained on display at the Museum Wiesbaden for ten years before being transferred in 1956 to West Berlin, where it was exhibited at the Dahlem Museum. As early as 1946, East Germany (German Democratic Republic) pressed for the return of the bust to Museum Island in East Berlin, where it had been displayed before the war. In 1967, the bust was moved to the Egyptian Museum in the Charlottenburg borough of Berlin and remained there until 2005, when it was moved to the Altes Museum. The bust returned to the Neues Museum as its centerpiece when the museum reopened in October 2009. Controversies =Requests for repatriation to Egypt= Since the official unveiling of the bust in Berlin in 1924, Egyptian authorities have demanded its return to Egypt.Breger p. 285Sieher p. 116 In 1925, Egypt threatened to ban German excavations in Egypt unless the bust was returned. In 1929, Egypt offered to exchange other artifacts for the bust, but Germany declined. In the 1950s, Egypt again tried to initiate negotiations, but there was no response from Germany. Although Germany had previously strongly opposed repatriation, in 1933 Hermann G√∂ring considered returning the bust to King Farouk Fouad of Egypt as a political gesture. Hitler opposed the idea and told the Egyptian government that he would build a new Egyptian museum for Nefertiti. \\"In the middle, this wonder, Nefertiti, will be enthroned,\\" Hitler said. \\"I will never relinquish the head of the Queen.\\" While the bust was under American control, Egypt requested the United States to hand it over; the US refused and advised Egypt to take up the matter with the new German authorities. In 1989, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak viewed the bust and announced that Nefertiti was \\"the best ambassador for Egypt\\" in Berlin. Zahi Hawass believed that the bust belongs to Egypt and that it was taken out of Egypt illegally and should therefore be returned. He maintained the stance that Egyptian authorities were misled over the acquisition of the bust in 1913 and demanded that Germany prove that it was exported legally. According to Kurt G. Siehr, another argument in support of repatriation is that \\"Archeological finds have their 'home' in the country of origin and should be preserved in that country.\\"Siehr pp. 133‚Äì4 The repatriation issue sprang up again in 2003 over the Body of Nefertiti sculpture. In 2005, Hawass requested that UNESCO intervene to return the bust. In 2007, Hawass threatened to ban exhibitions of Egyptian artifacts in Germany if the bust was not lent to Egypt, but to no avail. He also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to German museums to initiate what he called a \\"scientific war\\". Hawass wanted Germany to lend the bust to Egypt in 2012 for the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids of Giza. Simultaneously, a campaign called \\"Nefertiti Travels\\" was launched by cultural association CulturCooperation, based in Hamburg, Germany. They distributed postcards depicting the bust with the words \\"Return to Sender\\" and wrote an open letter to German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann supporting the view that Egypt should be given the bust on loan. In 2009, when the bust was moved back to the Neues Museum, the appropriateness of Berlin as its location was questioned. Several German art experts have attempted to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and Egyptian authorities. German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that legal arguments for repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany. In December 2009, Friederike Seyfried, director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, presented to the Egyptians documents held by the museum regarding the discovery of the bust, which include a protocol signed by the German excavator and the Egyptian Antiquities Service. In the documents, the bust was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess, but in his diary, Borchardt clearly referred to it as the head of Nefertiti. \\"This proves that Borchardt wrote this description so that his country can get the statue,\\" Hawass said. \\"These materials confirm Egypt's contention that (he) did act unethically with intent to deceive.\\" However, Hawass said Egypt didn't consider the bust to be a looted antiquity. \\"I really want it back,\\" he said. His statement quoted the director of the museum as saying the authority to approve the return of the bust to Egypt lies with Prussian Cultural Heritage and the German culture minister.The Associated Press:Egypt antiquities chief to demand Nefertiti bust =Allegations over authenticity= The French language book Le Buste de Nefertiti ‚Äì une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (The Bust of Nefertiti ‚Äì a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art historian Henri Stierlin and the book Missing Link in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust would have been a sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery and, while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the bust and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders and that the original was lost in World War II. For pictures, In 1989, a 70 pfennig stamp which featured the bust of Nefertiti was on issue in Germany. Dietrich Wildung dismissed the claims as a publicity stunt since radiological tests, detailed computer tomography and material analysis have proved its authenticity. The pigments used on the bust have been matched to those used by ancient Egyptian artisans. The 2006 CT scan that discovered the \\"hidden face\\" of Nefertiti proved, according to Science News, that the bust was genuine. Egyptian authorities also dismissed Stierlin's theory. Hawass said, \\"Stierlin is not a historian. He is delirious.\\" Although Stierlin had argued \\"Egyptians cut shoulders horizontally\\" and Nefertiti had vertical shoulders, Hawass said that the new style seen in the bust is part of the changes introduced by Akhenaten, the husband of Nefertiti. Hawass also claimed that Thutmose had created the eye, but it was later destroyed. =Body of Nefertiti= In 2003, the Egyptian Museum in Berlin allowed the Hungarian artist duo Little Warsaw, Andr√°s G√°lik and B√°lint Havas, to place the bust atop a nearly nude female bronze for a video installation to be shown at the Venice Biennale modern art festival. The artists said the project, called Body of Nefertiti, was an attempt to pay homage to the bust. According to Wildung, it showed \\"the continued relevance of the ancient world to today's art.\\" Egyptian cultural officials proclaimed it to be a disgrace to \\"one of the great symbols of their country's history\\" and banned Wildung and his wife from further exploration in Egypt.For a picture of \\"The Body of Nefertiti\\" see The Egyptian Minister for Culture, Farouk Hosny, declared that Nefertiti was \\"not in safe hands\\" and although Egypt had not renewed their claims for restitution \\"due to the good relations with Germany,\\" this \\"recent behaviour\\" was unacceptable. Cultural significance In 1930, the German press described the bust as their new monarch, personifying it as a queen. As the \\"'most precious ... stone in the setting of the diadem' from the art treasures of 'Prussia Germany'\\", Nefertiti would re-establish the imperial German national identity after 1918. Hitler described the bust as \\"a unique masterpiece, an ornament, a true treasure\\", and pledged to build a museum to house it. By the 1970s, the bust had become an issue of national identity to both German states, East Germany and West Germany, created after World War II.Breger p. 291 In 1999, the bust appeared on an election poster for the green political party B√ºndnis 90/Die Gr√ºnen as a promise for a cosmopolitan and multi-cultural environment with the slogan \\"Strong Women for Berlin!\\"Breger p. 292 According to Claudia Breger, another reason that the bust became associated with German national identity was its place as a rival to Tutankhamun, found by the British who then ruled Egypt. The bust became an influence on popular culture, with Jack Pierce's make-up work on Elsa Lanchester's iconic hairstyle in the film Bride of Frankenstein being inspired by it.Elizabeth Young, \\"Here Comes the Bride: Wedding Gender and Race in Bride of Frankenstein\\"; Feminist Studies, Vol. 17, 1991. 35 pgs.

It is most commonly used in short-term management of anxiety disorders, specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea, together with other treatments. GAD improvement occurs generally within a week. Alprazolam is generally taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, headaches, feeling tired, dry mouth, and memory problems. Some of the sedation and tiredness may improve within a few days. Due to concerns about misuse, some do not recommend alprazolam as an initial treatment for panic disorder. Withdrawal or rebound symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased; gradually decreasing the dose over weeks or months may be required. Other rare risks include suicide, possibly due to loss of inhibition. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, acts through the GABAA receptor. Alprazolam was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. Alprazolam is a Schedule IV controlled substance and is a common drug of abuse. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 21st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. Medical uses Alprazolam 0.5mg pills Alprazolam is mostly used in short term management of anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam may also be indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, as well as for the treatment of anxiety conditions with co-morbid depression. The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug. =Panic disorder= Alprazolam is effective in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, it is not a first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit. In the United States, alprazolam is FDA- approved for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Alprazolam is recommended by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder where there is no history of tolerance or dependence. =Anxiety disorders= Anxiety associated with depression is responsive to alprazolam. Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2‚Äì4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety. =Nausea due to chemotherapy= Alprazolam may be used in combination with other medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Contraindications Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in children and in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol). Like all central nervous system depressants, alprazolam in larger-than-normal doses can cause significant deterioration in alertness and increase drowsiness, especially in those unaccustomed to the drug's effects. Elderly individuals should be cautious in the use of alprazolam due to the possibility of increased susceptibility to side-effects, especially loss of coordination and drowsiness. Side effects Side effects from alprazolam Sedative drugs, including alprazolam, have been associated with an increased risk of death. Possible side effects include: * Anterograde amnesia and concentration problems * Ataxia, slurred speech * Disinhibition * Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, unsteadiness, and impaired coordination, vertigo * Dry mouth (infrequent) * Hallucinations (rare) * Jaundice (very rare) * Seizures (less common) * Skin rash, respiratory depression, constipation * Suicidal ideation or suicide * Urinary retention (infrequent) *Muscle weakness In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. =Paradoxical reactions= Although unusual, the following paradoxical reactions have been shown to occur: * Aggression * Mania, agitation, hyperactivity, and restlessness * Rage, hostility * Twitches and tremor =Food and drug interactions= Alprazolam is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which may result in its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects. Imipramine and desipramine have been reported to increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alprazolam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of alprazolam and accumulation. Alcohol is one of the most common interactions; alcohol and alprazolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another, which can cause severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. The more alcohol and alprazolam taken, the worse the interaction. Combination of alprazolam with the herb kava can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Plants in the genus Hypericum (including St. John's wort) conversely can lower the plasma levels of alprazolam and reduce its therapeutic effect. =Pregnancy and breastfeeding= Benzodiazepines cross the placenta, enter the fetus, and are also excreted in breast milk. Chronic administration of diazepam, another benzodiazepine, to nursing mothers has been reported to cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight. The use of alprazolam during pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. =Overdose= Xanax: 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg scored tablets The maximum recommended daily dose is 10 milligrams per day. Overdoses of alprazolam can be mild to severe depending on the quantity ingested and if other drugs are taken in combination. Alprazolam overdoses cause excess central nervous system (CNS) depression and may include one or more of the following symptoms: * Coma and death if alprazolam is combined with other substances. * Fainting * Hypotension (low blood pressure) * Hypoventilation (shallow breathing) * Impaired motor functions ** Dizziness ** Impaired balance ** Impaired or absent reflexes ** Muscle weakness * Orthostatic hypotension (fainting while standing up too quickly) * Somnolence (drowsiness) =Dependence and withdrawal= The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the short half-life and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long- term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent. Withdrawal and rebound symptoms commonly occur and necessitate a gradual reduction in dosage to minimize withdrawal effects when discontinuing. Not all withdrawal effects are evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of symptoms such as anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence of the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug- dependent. Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines may also cause the development of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower- dosage regimen. In 1992, Romach and colleagues reported that dose escalation is not a characteristic of long-term alprazolam users and that the majority of long-term alprazolam users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required. Some common symptoms of alprazolam discontinuation include malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Those taking more than 4 mg per day have an increased potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases have been known to cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety. In a 1983 study, only 5% of patients who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% of those who had been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam ‚Äì a short-acting benzodiazepine ‚Äì taken for 8 weeks, 65% of patients experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering. The benzodiazepines diazepam and oxazepam have been found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam, temazepam, or lorazepam. Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross- dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation. Pharmacology Binding at the Œ±1Œ≤3Œ≥2 GABAA receptor. Alprazolam with red space-filling carbon atoms. Œ≥2 receptor subunit in mint green. The Œ±1' subunit is hidden.Masiulis S et al (2019). Nature. Vol 565, pages 454‚Äì459 Alprazolam is a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. When it binds to the receptor, effects of GABA are enhanced leading to inhibition of neurones in the brain. This results in effects including reduced anxiety, muscle relaxant, antidepressant and anticonvulsant activity. The activity of alprazolam in the central nervous system is dose dependent. =Mechanism of action= Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolobenzodiazepine: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring attached to its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces a variety of therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor site and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. Binding of alprazolam to the GABAA receptor, a chloride ion channel, enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter. When GABA binds the GABAA receptor the channel opens and chloride enters the cell which makes it more resistant to depolarisation. Therefore, alprazolam has a depressant effect on synaptic transmission to reduce anxiety. The GABAA receptor is made up of 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam that have a triazole ring fused to their diazepine ring appear to have antidepressant properties. This is perhaps due to the similarities shared with tricyclic antidepressants, as they have two benzene rings fused to a diazepine ring. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic. Giving alprazolam, as compared to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum. =Pharmacokinetics= Alprazolam is metabolized into 4-hydroxyalprazolam (top) and Œ±-hydroxyalprazolam (bottom). Alprazolam is taken orally, and is absorbed well ‚Äì 80% of alprazolam binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after one to two hours. Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, mostly by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Œ±-hydroxyalprazolam, as well as an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Œ±-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam. The metabolites, as well as some unmetabolized alprazolam, are filtered out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine. Chemistry =Physical properties= Alprazolam is a triazole and benzodiazepine derivative substituted with a phenyl group at position 6, with a chlorine atom at position 8 and with a methyl group at position 1. It is an analogue of triazolam, the difference between them being the absence of a chlorine atom in the 'ortho' position of the phenyl ring. It is slightly soluble in chloroform, soluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in acetone and insoluble in water.Maryadele J. O'Neil, Ann Smith, Patricia E. Heckelman, Susan Budavari (2013). The Merck Index - An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. Cambridge, Regatul Unit: Royal Society of Chemistry, p. 58; It has a melting point in the temperature range 228 - 229.5 ¬∞C. =Synthesis= For the synthesis of alprazolam the same method can be used as for triazolam, excepting that it starts from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone. However, an alternative easier synthesis starting with 2,6-dichloro-4-phenylquinoline has been suggested, in which it reacts with hydrazine giving 6-chloro-2-hydrazino-4-phenylquinoline. Boiling the mixture with triethyl orthoacetate results in cyclization with the formation of the triazole ring. The product undergoes oxidative degradation in the presence of periodate and ruthenium dioxide in acetone solution, giving 2-[4-(3'-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone. Oxy-methylation with formaldehyde results in a product that is treated with phosphorus tribromide, when 2-[4-(3'-methyl-5'-bromomethyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone is obtained. By substituting the bromine atom with an amino group conferred by ammonia, it forms alprazolam triazolobenzophenone, following which an intermolecular heterocyclization takes place to obtain alprazolam. =Detection= Quantification of alprazolam in blood and plasma samples may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of intoxication in hospitalized patients, or to provide evidence in the case of crimes e.g., impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a thorough forensic investigation, e.g., in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually in a range of 10‚Äì100 Œºg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100‚Äì300 Œºg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300‚Äì2000 Œºg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most of the commercial immunoassays used for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitative determination are usually done by chromatographic techniques. Forms of alprazolam Alprazolam regular release and orally disintegrating tablets are available as 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg. Liquid alprazolam is available in a 1 mg/mL oral concentrate. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, povidone, sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25 mg tablet contains D&C; Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5 mg tablet contains FD&C; Yellow No. 6 and D&C; Yellow No. 10. Society and culture =Patent= Alprazolam is covered under , which was filed on 29 October 1969, granted on 19 October 1976, and expired in September 1993. =Recreational use= There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam's high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of alprazolam also add to its addictive nature. In the small subgroup of individuals who escalate their doses there is usually a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders. Despite this, most prescribed alprazolam users do not use their medication recreationally, and the long-term use of benzodiazepines does not generally correlate with the need for dose escalation. However, based on US findings from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), an annual compilation of patient characteristics in substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States, admissions due to \\"primary tranquilizer\\" (including, but not limited to, benzodiazepine-type) drug use increased 79% from 1992 to 2002, suggesting that misuse of benzodiazepines may be on the rise. In 2011, The New York Times reported, \\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year reported an 89 percent increase in emergency room visits nationwide related to nonmedical benzodiazepine use between 2004 and 2008.\\" Alprazolam is one of the most commonly prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency department visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006. Those at a particularly high risk for misuse and dependence are people with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse and/or dependence and people with borderline personality disorder. Alprazolam, along with other benzodiazepines, is often used with other recreational drugs. These uses include aids to relieve the panic or distress of dysphoric (\\"bad trip\\") reactions to psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, and the drug-induced agitation and insomnia in the \\"comedown\\" stages of stimulant use, such as amphetamine, cocaine, and MDMA allowing sleep. Alprazolam may also be used with other depressant drugs, such as ethanol, heroin, and other opioids, in an attempt to enhance their psychological effects. Alprazolam may be used in conjunction with cannabis, with users citing a synergistic effect achieved after consuming the combination. The poly-drug use of powerful depressant drugs poses the highest level of health concerns due to a significant increase in the likelihood of experiencing an overdose, which may cause fatal respiratory depression. A 1990 study found that diazepam has a higher misuse potential relative to many other benzodiazepines and that some data suggest that alprazolam and lorazepam resemble diazepam in this respect. Anecdotally, injection of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure of blood vessels (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water‚Äîwhen crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40 ¬µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper in a manner similar to LSD. =Popular culture= Slang terms for alprazolam vary from place to place. Some of the more common terms are modified versions of the trade name \\"Xanax\\", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Xans, Z-bars, handle bars, beans, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. =Availability= Alprazolam is available in English-speaking countries under the following brand names: * Alprax, Alprocontin, Alzam, Alzolam, Anzilum, Apo-Alpraz, Helex, Kalma, Mylan- Alprazolam, Niravam, Novo-Alprazol, Nu-Alpraz, Pacyl, Restyl, Tranax, Trika, Xycalm, Xanax, Xanor, Zolam, Zopax. In December 2013, in anticipation of the rescheduling of alprazolam to Schedule 8 in Australia, Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it was no longer commercially viable. =Legal status= Alprazolam has varied legal status depending on jurisdiction: * In the United States, alprazolam is a prescription drug and is assigned to Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration. * Under the UK drug misuse classification system, benzodiazepines are Class C drugs (Schedule 4). In the UK, alprazolam is not available on the NHS and can only be obtained on a private prescription. * In Ireland, alprazolam is a Schedule 4 medicine. * In Sweden, alprazolam is a prescription drug in List IV (Schedule 4) under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968). * In the Netherlands, alprazolam is a List 2 substance of the Opium Law and is available for prescription. * In Germany, alprazolam can be prescribed normally in doses up to 1 mg. Higher doses are scheduled as Anlage III drugs and require a special prescription form. * In Australia, alprazolam was originally a Schedule 4 (Prescription Only) medication; however, as of February 2014, it has become a Schedule 8 medication, subjecting it to more rigorous prescribing requirements. * In the Philippines, alprazolam is legally classified as a \\"dangerous drug\\" under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, along with other schedule drugs listed in the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The importation of dangerous drugs including alprazolam, requires authorization from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Internationally, alprazolam is included under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as Schedule IV.

It is an alternative socioeconomic model of agriculture and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming. The model is a subcategory of civic agriculture that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of community through local markets. In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits and vegetables and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs. The term CSA is mostly used in the United States and Canada, but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide. History The term \\"community-supported agriculture\\" was coined in the northeastern United States in the 1980s, influenced by European biodynamic agriculture ideas formulated by Rudolf Steiner.\\"History of Community Supported Agriculture, Part 1\\" (2005), Rodale Institute, accessed 05-15-2013. Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s. Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named Topinambur located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term \\"community-supported agriculture\\" stems from Vander Tuin. This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at Great Barrington was created in Massachusetts by Jan Vander Tuin, Susan Witt, and Robyn Van En. The Temple- Wilton Community Farm was created in New Hampshire by Anthony Graham, Trauger Groh, and Lincoln Geiger. Mustard Seed Farms, an organic CSA farm in Oregon The CSA Garden at Great Barrington remained together until 1990 when many members left to form the Mahaiwe Harvest CSA. One of the original founders, Robyn Van En, became incredibly influential in the CSA movement in America and founded CSA North America in 1992. The Temple-Wilton Community Garden was more successful and still operates as a CSA today. It became an important member of the Wilton community and it receives funding from state, federal, and local sources. A parallel model called Teikei existed in Japan as early as the mid 1960s. Similarly, Dr. Booker T. Whatley, a professor of agriculture in Alabama, advocated for Clientele Membership Clubs as early as the 1960s. Since the 1980s, community supported farms have been organized throughout North America ‚Äî mainly in New England, the Northwest, the Pacific coast, the Upper- Midwest and Canada. North America now has at least 13,000 CSA farms of which 12,549 are in the US according to the US Department of Agriculture in 2007. The rise of CSAs seems to be correlated with the increase in awareness of the environmental movement in the United States. Some examples of larger and well established CSAs in the US are Angelic Organics, Golden Earthworm Organic Farm Honeybrook Organic Farm Phillies Bridge Farm Project, and Roxbury Farm.Roxbury farm.com Roxbury Farm CSAs have even become popular in urban environments as proven by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger's own CSA program that maintains locations in all five boroughs of the city.Farm-fresh project The largest subscription CSA with over 13,000 families is Farm Fresh To You in Capay Valley, California.Mark Anderson (22 August 2010). Capay farm, distributor buys West Sac warehouse. Sacramento Business Journal The Qu√©bec CSA network (17 years old in 2012) is one of the largest in the world. It is a unique system where a non-profit organization reaches the customers for the farmers and provide these farmers with technical support. More than one hundred farms are part of this network. Some CSAs are used by farmers, such as Sugar Mountain Farm in Vermont, to finance improvements and new infrastructure. Since 2008, the international CSA network Urgenci has been coordinating dissemination and exchange programmes that have resulted in the creation of dozens of small-scale CSA in Central and Eastern Europe. CSA was introduced to China following a series of food safety scandals in the late 2000s. It was estimated that there were more than 500 CSA farms in China by 2017. They have been a critical force in the development of the organic and ecological farming in China. Chinese CSA farmers, researchers and civil society organizations gather annually at the national CSA symposium held since 2009.Scott, Steffanie; Si, Zhenzhong; Schumilas, Theresa and Chen, Aijuan. (2018). Organic Food and Farming in China: Top-down and Bottom-up Ecological Initiatives New York: Routledge Much of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the \\"male dominated field of conventional agriculture\\". In community supported agriculture women represent 40 percent of farm operators.  Socio-economic model  CSAs create direct connections between producers and consumers through alternative markets and the members and farmers share the risk of farming. The goals of the first CSA model in the US were to have the producer and consumer to come into the market as equals and make an exchange with fair prices and fair wages. The consumer pays for things such as transparency, environmental stewardship, producer relationships, etc. The farmers engaged in CSAs do so to fulfill goals other than income and are not compensated fairly in these exchanges. This kind of market holds ‚Äòeconomic rents‚Äô where the consumer surplus comes from the consumers‚Äô willingness to pay for something further than the product as well as for the products inputs themselves. Although these markets still exist within a larger capitalist economy, they are able to exist because of the ‚Äòeconomic rents‚Äô that are collected. CSA system CSAs generally focus on the production of high quality foods for a local community, often using organic or biodynamic farming methods, and a shared risk membership‚Äìmarketing structure. This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual ‚Äî resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship. The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season's budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole- budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste. =Structure= Community-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant.2009 Survey of Community Supported Agriculture Producers , University of Kentucky, accessed 05-15-2013. The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.\\"Community Supported Agriculture\\", The Center for Social Research. Accessed 05-15-2013. From this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed: * Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA. * Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management. * Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program. * Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.\\"Community Supported Agriculture\\" , Technotes: Office of Community Development, US Department of Agriculture, accessed 05-15-2013. In most original CSAs, a core group of members existed. This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions. CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful. However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members. CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs. \\"CSA Across the Nation\\" Center for Integrated Agricultural Services. Accessed 05-22-2013 =Ideology= Community-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of anthroposophy and biodynamic agriculture. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs: * New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers * New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees * New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise As CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically. While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy. This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs. The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA. The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.\\"Devon Acres CSA: local struggles in a global food system\\" (2008), retrieved 04-11-2013. =Distribution and marketing methods= Shares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps. Share prices vary from CSA to CSA. Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people. Prices range from $200 to $500 per season. Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250.\\"Community Supported Agriculture Entering the 21st Century\\". Accessed 23 May 2013. Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community. Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options. Shares are distributed in several different ways. Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm. Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers' markets, and community center/church dropoff. For example, the new \\"Farmie Markets\\" of upstate New York take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers. CSAs market their farms and shares in different ways. CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions. CSAs use local farmers' markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over- production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers' markets. Excess products are sometimes given to food banks. = Challenges for farmers = Many CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more (an economic rent if this puts the price above the cost of production) if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it. However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt's 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers charged lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security. This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see moral economy.

Four main musical genres are indigenous to this area ‚Äî Creole music (i.e. zydeco), swamp pop, and swamp blues. These historically-rooted genres, with unique rhythms and personalities, have been transformed with modern sounds and instruments. The southwestern and south central Louisiana areas herald many artists and songs that have become international hits, won Grammy awards, and become highly sought after by collectors. In southwestern Louisiana in the 1800s, the fiddle was the most popular Cajun instrument and the music still carried clear influences from the Poitou region of France and the Scottish/Canadian influences of their earlier homeland. In the late 19th century German immigrants spreading outward from central and eastern Texas and New Orleans soon brought the accordion as well. Creoles at the time sang a rhythmic type of song called jur√©. When accordion, fiddle and the triangle iron were added later, the music evolved into French music or form la la, a central component of Creole music. La la was primarily rural, played at house dances also known as la las, and found in towns in the prairie regions like Mamou, Eunice and Opelousas. In 1901 (see 1901 in music), oil was discovered at Jennings and immigration boomed. Many of the newcomers were white businessmen from outside of Louisiana who attempted to force the Creoles and Cajuns to adopt the dominant American cultural forms, even outlawing the use of the French language in 1916. Despite the law, many Creoles and Cajuns still spoke French at home, and musical performances were in French. =Creole music= The term \\"Creole music\\" is used to describe both the early folk or roots music traditions of French and Metis rural Creoles of South Louisiana and the later more contemporary genre called Zydeco. It was often simply called French music or La La. It was sung in French patois by Creoles. This early American roots music evolved in the 1930s into a richer sound accompanied by more instruments. Creole pioneer Amede Ardoin is said to be the first Creole to record this indigenous music. He has also been credited for greatly influencing the foundation of Cajun music. Melodies from pioneers like Ardoin provided a basis for works by composers Louis Moreau Gottschalk and Moses Hogan and others. Creole music traditions in the US have been known to change and evolve as quickly as they were being replicated by white artists, the music of the Creoles also evolved into a more contemporary amplified sound that was later called zydeco, which is the indigenous music of the Creoles or \\"Creole music\\". Zydeco comes from French les haricots, meaning snap or green beans as in les haricots (ne) sont pas sal√©s (the beans are not seasoned (with salt pork) because times are hard right now). Zydeco fused the traditional Creole roots music sung in French with contemporary sounds making it relevant, dynamic and constantly attracting a new generation of listeners within the Creole community as well as outside the community. This fusion was birthed in the Creole lala, jazz and blues halls (joints) of Frenchtown, Houston, Texas which were frequented by Creole immigrants from West Louisiana and East Texas.Michael Tisserand, \\"The Kingdom Of Zydeco\\", New York: Arcade 1998. =Cajun music= Cajun music is rooted in the music of the preexisting Creoles and the French-speaking Catholics of eastern Canada and became transformed into a unique sound of the Cajun culture. In earlier years of the late 18th century the fiddle was the predominant instrument and the music tended to sound more like early country music. Cajun music is typically a waltz or two step. Unlike the folk music of Quebec, it is not associated with the Celtic tradition. =Zydeco= Early in the 1950s, zydeco evolved from the music of the Creoles in southwest and south central Louisiana. At an earlier period, Creole and Cajun music were more similar, but after World War II, this regional French music evolved into a distinct expression of the Creoles, Louisianians whose shared languages and culture transcend race. Along with the accordion, the second main instrument in a zydeco group is a corrugated metal washboard, called a Zydeco Rubboard or frottoir. They made the music contemporary by adding electrical instruments (guitar and bass), keyboards, drumkit and even sometimes horns. The Creole Zydeco music of Grammy-winning artists Queen Ida Guillory, Clifton Chenier, Rockin' Sidney Simien, Buckwheat Zydeco and Terrance Simien remain some of the most internationally recognized zydeco music. John Delafose, Andrus Espree (aka Beau Jocque), Boozoo Chavis, Rosie Ledet, Chubby Carrier, Canray Fontenot, Am√©d√© Ardoin, Rockin' Dopsie, Geno Delafose, Nathan Williams, Keith Frank, Chris Ardoin, Nathan Williams Jr., J Paul Jr., Cedric Watson and Jeffery Broussard are also other well known zydeco musicians. =Swing Out= Swing out can be classified as a cross between the music genres of southwest Louisiana including Zydeco and Southern Soul. It is especially popular in the Acadiana region, being that so many artists originate and perform in this part of the state. Its popularity has caused an expansion of the music throughout the southern portion of the United States. Swing out music is usually produced and doesn't involve the use of live instruments unlike zydeco. Notable artists include Tucka James, Roi \\"Chip\\" Anthony, \\"Lysa\\" Harrington, and AudiYo. =Swamp blues= Swamp blues developed around Baton Rouge in the 1950s and reached a peak of popularity in the 1960s. It generally has a slow tempo and incorporates influences from other genres of music, particularly the regional styles of zydeco and Cajun music. Its most successful proponents included Slim Harpo and Lightnin' Slim, who enjoyed a number of rhythm and blues and national hits and whose work was frequently covered by bands of the British Invasion.R. Unterberger, \\"Louisiana blues\\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), , pp. 687-8. =Swamp pop= Swamp pop came about in the mid-1950s. With the Cajun dance and musical conventions in mind, nationally popular African American music genres such as rock, pop, country, and R&B; songs were re-recorded, sometimes in French. Swamp pop is more of a combination of many influences, and the bridge between zydeco, New Orleans second line, and rock and roll. The song structure is pure rock and roll, the rhythms are distinctly New Orleans based, the chord changes, vocals and inflections are R&B; influenced, and the lyrics are sometimes French. North Louisiana music The region's location, bordered by Texas on the west and the Mississippi Delta on the east has not led to the development of \\"locally stylized\\" music. Traditional and modern country music has been dominant, creating its own country stars, like Tim McGraw, Jimmie Davis, Tony Joe White, and Andy Griggs from Northeast Louisiana, and Trace Adkins, Kix Brooks, and Hank Williams Jr. from Northwest Louisiana. However, North Louisiana's lasting contribution to the world of popular music was the radio program The Louisiana Hayride, which started broadcasting in 1948 on KWKH in Shreveport. Hank Williams, George Jones, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and nearly every other country legend, or future country legend alive during the 1950s stepped on stage at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. They performed, many for the first time on radio, on a signal that covered much of the southeastern US. The original production of the show ended in 1960, but re-runs and the occasional special broadcast continued for a few years. The Louisiana Hayride was regarded as a stepping stone to The Grand Ole Opry, the legendary radio show from WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Northern Louisiana in the 1950s had a country rock scene, many of whose artists (the Lonesome Drifter) were recorded by local Ram Records. Later, Shreveport produced The Residents, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Sunday Mass Murder. Shreveport native Danny Johnson a veteran of the industry gracing the stages and recordings of Rod Stewart, Rick Derringer, Alice Cooper, and Alcatrazz. (Eddie Van Halens) Private Life, Danny Johnson and the Bandits, and Axis. He has been the guitar slinger for the last 16 years for Steppenwolf. Jeff Mangum, founder of Neutral Milk Hotel and The Elephant 6 Recording Company was born in Ruston, Louisiana. New Orleans music In the 19th century, there was already a mixture of French, Spanish, African and Afro-Caribbean music. The city had a great love for Opera; many operatic works had their first performances in the New World in New Orleans. =Early African, Caribbean and Creole music= Unlike in the Protestant colonies of what would become the USA, African slaves and their descendants were not prohibited from performing their traditional music in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. The African slaves, many from the Caribbean islands, were allowed to gather on Sundays, their day off, on a plaza known as Congo Square. Permitted as early as 1817, dancing in New Orleans had been restricted to the square, which was a hotbed of musical fusion, as African styles from across America and the Caribbean met and danced in large groups, often in circle dances. The Congo Square gatherings became well known, and many whites came to watch and listen. Nevertheless, by 1830, opposition from whites in New Orleans and an influx of blacks elsewhere in the U.S. caused the decline of Congo Square's prominence. The tradition of mass dances in Congo Square continued sporadically, though it came to have more in common with minstrelsy than with authentic African traditions. Caribbean dances known to have been imported to Louisiana include the calenda, Congo, counjai, and bamboula. Louis Gottschalk was an early 19th-century White Creole pianist and composer from New Orleans, the first American musician/composer to become famous in Europe. A number of his works incorporate rhythms and music he heard performed by African slaves. In addition to the slave population, antebellum New Orleans also had a large population of free people of color, mostly Creoles of mixed African and European heritage who worked as tradesmen. The more prosperous Creoles sent their children to be educated in France. They had their own dance bands, an opera company, and a symphony orchestra. The community produced such composers as Edmund Dede and Basil Bares. After the American Civil War many Creole musicians became music teachers, teaching the use of European instruments to the newly freed slaves and their descendants. =Jazz= Probably the single most famous style of music to originate in the city was New Orleans jazz, also known as Dixieland. It came into being around 1900. Many with memories of the time say that the most important figure in the formation of the music was Papa Jack Laine who enlisted hundreds of musicians from all of the city's diverse ethnic groups and social status. Most of these musicians became instrumental in forming jazz music including Buddy Bolden, Bunk Johnson and the members of Original Dixieland Jazz Band. One of early rural blues, ragtime, and marching band music were combined with collective improvisation to create this new style of music. At first, the music was known by various names such as \\"hot music\\", \\"hot ragtime\\" and \\"ratty music\\"; the term \\"jazz\\" (early on often spelled \\"jass\\") did not become common until the 1910s. The early style was exemplified by the bands of such musicians as Freddie Keppard, Jelly Roll Morton, \\"King\\" Joe Oliver, Kid Ory. The next generation took the young art form into more daring and sophisticated directions, with such creative musical virtuosos as Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Red Allen. New Orleans was a regional Tin Pan Alley music composing and publishing center through the 1920s, and was also an important center of ragtime. Louis Prima demonstrated the versatility of the New Orleans tradition, taking a style rooted in traditional New Orleans jazz into swinging hot music popular into the rock and roll era. He is buried in New Orleans.Contemporary jazz has had a following in New Orleans with musicians such as Alvin Batiste and Ellis Marsalis. Some younger jazz virtuosos such as Wynton Marsalis and Nicholas Payton experiment with the avant garde while refusing to disregard the traditions of early jazz. Continuing development of the traditional New Orleans jazz style, Tom McDermott, Evan Christopher, New Orleans Nightcrawlers. Harry Connick Jr. was raised in New Orleans and attended Loyola University New Orleans. =New Orleans blues= The blues that developed in the 1940s and 1950s in and around the city of New Orleans was strongly influenced by jazz and incorporated Caribbean influences, it is dominated by piano and saxophone but has also produced major guitar bluesmen. Major figures in the genre include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim, who both produced major regional, R&B; and national hits. Louisiana blues created a specialized form of blues music sometimes using zydeco instrumentation and slow, tense rhythms that is closely related to New Orleans blues and swamp blues from Baton Rouge. =R&B;/gospel= Alan Toussaint composed or produced many songs, including \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Freedom For the Stallion\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, for example \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\" by Labelle. The Meters, Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe garned hit songs. New band Galactic released jazz funk album. Mahalia Jackson The city also has a rich tradition of gospel music and spirituals; Mahalia Jackson was the most famous of New Orleans' gospel singers. She is buried in Metairie. The Dixie Cups had a #1 Hot 100 hit with \\"Chapel of Love\\" in 1964. They also recorded the song \\"Iko Iko\\" about Mardi Gras. In the 1950s, New Orleans again influenced the national music scene as a center in the development of rhythm and blues. Important artists included Fats Domino (d. 2017), Snooks Eaglin, Dave Bartholomew, Professor Longhair, and Clarence Garlow. Malcolm John \\"Mac\\" Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John a New Orleans-born singer/songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combined blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll. Dr. John cited Professor Longhair as one of his musical influences and has recorded a number of his compositions, most notably \\"Tipitina\\". 1980s new style of \\"street beat\\" brass bands combining the jazz brass band tradition with funk and hip hop was spearheaded by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, then the Rebirth Brass Band. =Country music= Sammy Kershaw, Eddy Raven, Jo-el Sonnier, and the band River Road are all Acadiana natives who went on to score national fame and sell millions of records via the major labels in Nashville. =Rock/pop= Significant New Orleans rock band, and alternative bands include Zebra, The Radiators, Better Than Ezra (singer Kevin Griffin graduated from Louisiana State University in 1990), 12 Stones, and Cowboy Mouth. Popular alternative rock bands include Mutemath and Meriwether. Beginning in the mid-1990s, New Orleans became a hub of Southern rap. First with Master P and his No Limit clique based out of the 3rd Ward, then later came the Cash Money clique who popularized a unique semi-melodic Louisianan style of rapping to the hip hop mainstream. Lil Wayne became one of the most prominent New Orleans rappers. The city has also been a center of Southern hip hop, and the birthplace of mainstream Bounce music which originated in Baton Rouge. Louisiana is known as the most important place for the development of a style of heavy metal: sludge metal. Two of its founding acts, Eyehategod and Crowbar, are from New Orleans, where the genre's most important scene can be found. Other notable sludge metal bands such as Acid Bath, Down, Soilent Green and Choke are based in Louisiana. Blackened death metal band Goatwhore are from New Orleans. Britney Spears (from Kentwood) has had four #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including the dance-pop song \\"...Baby One More Time\\" from 1999. Lil Wayne has two #1 hits on the Hot 100, including \\"Lollipop\\" from 2008. The rapper Juvenile had a #1 hit on the Hot 100 with \\"Slow Motion\\" ft. Soulja Slim, from 2004 and a #1 album on the Billboard 200 with Reality Check in 2006. Tim McGraw has had 25 songs that have reached #1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, including \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\" from 2004. R&B; singer Frank Ocean had a #1 album on the Billboard 200 with Blonde in 2016. YoungBoy Never Broke Again from Baton Rouge had a #1 album in 2019. Recordings Small, local record labels proliferated from Houston, Texas to New Orleans, specializing in recording and distributing local acts. Labels such as Jin, Swallow, Maison de Soul, and Bayou continue to record and distribute Creole music, and other south Louisiana music. Many of the original versions of classic songs are still being made and distributed. One of the most successful label owners was Floyd Soileau. Soileau started as a local DJ in Ville Platte, Louisiana in the mid-1950s, and soon decided he would rather help make music than play it. He started most of the labels listed in the previous paragraph. He and his record shop are important pieces of Louisiana's music history.

Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (\\"glands\\") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood. The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC),Even by those using the British English spelling \\"oesophagus\\" which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux. The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended. As of 2018, esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer globally with 572,000 new cases during the year. It caused about 509,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China. It is around three times more common in men than in women. Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and other medical conditions, but generally tend to be fairly poor, as diagnosis is often late. Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%. Signs and symptoms Prominent symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer has infiltrated over 60% of the circumference of the esophageal tube, by which time the tumor is already in an advanced stage. Onset of symptoms is usually caused by narrowing of the tube due to the physical presence of the tumor. The first and the most common symptom is usually difficulty in swallowing, which is often experienced first with solid foods and later with softer foods and liquids. Pain when swallowing is less usual at first. Weight loss is often an initial symptom in cases of squamous-cell carcinoma, though not usually in cases of adenocarcinoma. Eventual weight loss due to reduced appetite and undernutrition is common. Pain behind the breastbone or in the region around the stomach often feels like heartburn. The pain can frequently be severe, worsening when food of any sort is swallowed. Another sign may be an unusually husky, raspy, or hoarse- sounding cough, a result of the tumor affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The presence of the tumor may disrupt the normal contractions of the esophagus when swallowing. This can lead to nausea and vomiting, regurgitation of food and coughing. There is also an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to food entering the airways through the abnormal connections (fistulas) that may develop between the esophagus and the trachea (windpipe). Early signs of this serious complication may be coughing on drinking or eating. The tumor surface may be fragile and bleed, causing vomiting of blood. Compression of local structures occurs in advanced disease, leading to such problems as upper airway obstruction and superior vena cava syndrome. Hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) may occur. If the cancer has spread elsewhere, symptoms related to metastatic disease may appear. Common sites of spread include nearby lymph nodes, the liver, lungs and bone. Liver metastasis can cause jaundice and abdominal swelling (ascites). Lung metastasis can cause, among other symptoms, impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), and dyspnea (the feelings often associated with impaired breathing). Causes The two main types (i.e. squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) have distinct sets of risk factors. Squamous-cell carcinoma is linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol. Adenocarcinoma has been linked to effects of long-term acid reflux. Tobacco is a risk factor for both types. Both types are more common in people over 60 years of age. =Squamous-cell carcinoma= The two major risk factors for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma are tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol. The combination of tobacco and alcohol has a strong synergistic effect. Some data suggest that about half of all cases are due to tobacco and about one-third to alcohol, while over three-quarters of the cases in men are due to the combination of smoking and heavy drinking. Risks associated with alcohol appear to be linked to its aldehyde metabolite and to mutations in certain related enzymes. Such metabolic variants are relatively common in Asia. Other relevant risk factors include regular consumption of very hot drinks (over 65 ¬∞C or 149 ¬∞F) and ingestion of caustic substances. High levels of dietary exposure to nitrosamines (chemical compounds found both in tobacco smoke and certain foodstuffs) also appear to be a relevant risk factor. Unfavorable dietary patterns seem to involve exposure to nitrosamines through processed and barbecued meats, pickled vegetables, etc., and a low intake of fresh foods. Other associated factors include nutritional deficiencies, low socioeconomic status, and poor oral hygiene. Chewing betel nut (areca) is an important risk factor in Asia. Physical trauma may increase the risk. This may include the drinking of very hot drinks. =Adenocarcinoma= Esophageal cancer (lower part) as a result of Barrett ºs esophagus Male predominance is particularly strong in this type of esophageal cancer, which occurs about 7 to 10 times more frequently in men. This imbalance may be related to the characteristics and interactions of other known risk factors, including acid reflux and obesity. The long-term erosive effects of acid reflux (an extremely common condition, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked to this type of cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, possibly due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett's esophagus is unclear, and may in the past have been overestimated. Being obese or overweight both appear to be associated with increased risk. The association with obesity seems to be the strongest of any type of obesity-related cancer, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Abdominal obesity seems to be of particular relevance, given the closeness of its association with this type of cancer, as well as with both GERD and Barrett's esophagus. This type of obesity is characteristic of men. Physiologically, it stimulates GERD and also has other chronic inflammatory effects. Helicobacter pylori infection (a common occurrence thought to have affected over half of the world's population) is not a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and actually appears to be protective. Despite being a cause of GERD and a risk factor for gastric cancer, the infection seems to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma of as much as 50%. The biological explanation for a protective effect is somewhat unclear. One explanation is that some strains of H. pylori reduce stomach acid, thereby reducing damage by GERD. Decreasing rates of H. pylori infection in Western populations over recent decades, which have been linked to less overcrowding in households, could be a factor in the concurrent increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Female hormones may also have a protective effect, as EAC is not only much less common in women but develops later in life, by an average of 20 years. Although studies of many reproductive factors have not produced a clear picture, risk seems to decline for the mother in line with prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Tobacco smoking increases risk, but the effect in esophageal adenocarcinoma is slight compared to that in squamous cell carcinoma, and alcohol has not been demonstrated to be a cause. =Related conditions= * Head and neck cancer is associated with second primary tumors in the region, including esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas, due to field cancerization (i.e. a regional reaction to long-term carcinogenic exposure). * History of radiation therapy for other conditions in the chest is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. * Corrosive injury to the esophagus by accidentally or intentionally swallowing caustic substances is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma. * Tylosis with esophageal cancer is a rare familial disease with autosomal dominant inheritance that has been linked to a mutation in the RHBDF2 gene, present on chromosome 17: it involves thickening of the skin of the palms and soles and a high lifetime risk of squamous cell carcinoma. * Achalasia (i.e. lack of the involuntary reflex in the esophagus after swallowing) appears to be a risk factor for both main types of esophageal cancer, at least in men, due to stagnation of trapped food and drink. * Plummer‚ÄìVinson syndrome (a rare disease that involves esophageal webs) is also a risk factor. * There is some evidence suggesting a possible causal association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and esophageal squamous- cell carcinoma. The relationship is unclear. Possible relevance of HPV could be greater in places that have a particularly high incidence of this form of the disease, as in some Asian countries, including China. * There is an association between celiac disease and esophageal cancer. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis, probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancy. Moreover, in some cases the detection of celiac disease is due to the development of cancer, whose early symptoms are similar to some that may appear in celiac disease. Diagnosis Esophageal cancer as shown by a filling defect during an upper GI series =Clinical evaluation= Although an occlusive tumor may be suspected on a barium swallow or barium meal, the diagnosis is best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a flexible tube with a light and camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy. Additional testing is needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see #Staging, below). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can evaluate whether the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes). The sensitivity of a CT scan is limited by its ability to detect masses (e.g. enlarged lymph nodes or involved organs) generally larger than 1 cm. Positron emission tomography is also used to estimate the extent of the disease and is regarded as more precise than CT alone. Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound can provide staging information regarding the level of tumor invasion, and possible spread to regional lymph nodes. The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 in long) is commonly divided into three parts for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur nearer the stomach and squamous cell carcinomas nearer the throat, but either may arise anywhere in the esophagus.

Most esophageal cancers fall into one of two classes: esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas (ESCC), which are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption‚Äîand esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC), which are often associated with a history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus. A rule of thumb is that a cancer in the upper two-thirds is likely to be ESCC and one in the lower one-third EAC. Rare histologic types of esophageal cancer include different variants of squamous-cell carcinoma, and non-epithelial tumors, such as leiomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma, among others. =Staging= Staging is based on the TNM staging system, which classifies the amount of tumor invasion (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M). The currently preferred classification is the 2010 AJCC staging system for cancer of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. To help guide clinical decision making, this system also incorporates information on cell type (ESCC, EAC, etc.), grade (degree of differentiation ‚Äì an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the cancer cells), and tumor location (upper, middle, lower, or junctionalCancer arising at the junction between the esophagus and stomach is often classified as stomach cancer, as in ICD-10. See: ).

Overcoming addiction to areca chewing in Asia is another promising strategy for the prevention of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. The risk can also be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight. According to the National Cancer Institute, \\"diets high in cruciferous (cabbage, broccoli/broccolini, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts) and green and yellow vegetables and fruits are associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer.\\" Dietary fiber is thought to be protective, especially against esophageal adenocarcinoma. There is no evidence that vitamin supplements change the risk. =Screening= People with Barrett's esophagus (a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus) are at much higher risk, and may receive regular endoscopic screening for the early signs of cancer. Because the benefit of screening for adenocarcinoma in people without symptoms is unclear, it is not recommended in the United States. Some areas of the world with high rates of squamous- carcinoma have screening programs. Management Esophageal stent for esophageal cancer Esophageal stent for esophageal cancer Before and after a total esophagectomy Typical scar lines after the two main methods of surgery Treatment is best managed by a multidisciplinary team covering the various specialties involved. Adequate nutrition must be assured, and appropriate dental care is essential. Factors that influence treatment decisions include the stage and cellular type of cancer (EAC, ESCC, and other types), along with the person's general condition and any other diseases that are present. In general, treatment with a curative intention is restricted to localized disease, without distant metastasis: in such cases a combined approach that includes surgery may be considered. Disease that is widespread, metastatic or recurrent is managed palliatively: in this case, chemotherapy may be used to lengthen survival, while treatments such as radiotherapy or stenting may be used to relieve symptoms and make it easier to swallow. =Surgery= If the cancer has been diagnosed while still in an early stage, surgical treatment with a curative intention may be possible. Some small tumors that only involve the mucosa or lining of the esophagus may be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Otherwise, curative surgery of early-stage lesions may entail removal of all or part of the esophagus (esophagectomy), although this is a difficult operation with a relatively high risk of mortality or post-operative difficulties. The benefits of surgery are less clear in early-stage ESCC than EAC. There are a number of surgical options, and the best choices for particular situations remain the subject of research and discussion. Online edition, with updates to 2014 As well as characteristics and location of the tumor, other factors include the patient's condition, and the type of operation the surgical team is most experienced with. The likely quality of life after treatment is a relevant factor when considering surgery. Surgical outcomes are likely better in large centers where the procedures are frequently performed. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, esophagectomy is nowadays not normally performed. Esophagectomy is the removal of a segment of the esophagus; as this shortens the length of the remaining esophagus, some other segment of the digestive tract is pulled up through the chest cavity and interposed. This is usually the stomach or part of the large intestine (colon) or jejunum. Reconnection of the stomach to a shortened esophagus is called an esophagogastric anastomosis. Esophagectomy can be performed using several methods. The choice of the surgical approach depends on the characteristics and location of the tumor, and the preference of the surgeon. Clear evidence from clinical trials for which approaches give the best outcomes in different circumstances is lacking. A first decision, regarding the point of entry, is between a transhiatial and a transthoracic procedure. The more recent transhiatial approach avoids the need to open the chest; instead the surgeon enters the body through an incision in the lower abdomen and another in the neck. The lower part of the esophagus is freed from the surrounding tissues and cut away as necessary. The stomach is then pushed through the esophageal hiatus (the hole where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm) and is joined to the remaining upper part of the esophagus at the neck. The traditional transthoracic approach enters the body through the chest, and has a number of variations. The thoracoabdominal approach opens the abdominal and thoracic cavities together, the two-stage Ivor Lewis (also called Lewis‚ÄìTanner) approach involves an initial laparotomy and construction of a gastric tube, followed by a right thoracotomy to excise the tumor and create an esophagogastric anastomosis. The three-stage McKeown approach adds a third incision in the neck to complete the cervical anastomosis. Recent approaches by some surgeons use what is called extended esophagectomy, where more surrounding tissue, including lymph nodes, is removed en bloc. If the person cannot swallow at all, an esophageal stent may be inserted to keep the esophagus open; stents may also assist in occluding fistulas. A nasogastric tube may be necessary to continue feeding while treatment for the tumor is given, and some patients require a gastrostomy (feeding hole in the skin that gives direct access to the stomach). The latter two are especially important if the patient tends to aspirate food or saliva into the airways, predisposing for aspiration pneumonia. =Chemotherapy and radiotherapy= Chemotherapy depends on the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or carboplatin or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial ‚Äì for example ‚Äì compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine. Radiotherapy is given before, during, or after chemotherapy or surgery, and sometimes on its own to control symptoms. In patients with localised disease but contraindications to surgery, \\"radical radiotherapy\\" may be used with curative intent. =Other approaches= Forms of endoscopic therapy have been used for stage 0 and I disease: endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and mucosal ablation using radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation. Laser therapy is the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while affecting only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells. File:Diagram showing internal radiotherapy for cancer of the oesophagus CRUK 162.svgInternal radiotherapy for esophageal cancer File:SEMS endo.jpgSelf- expandable metallic stents are sometimes used for palliative care =Follow- up= Patients are followed closely after a treatment regimen has been completed. Frequently, other treatments are used to improve symptoms and maximize nutrition. Prognosis In general, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is quite poor, because most patients present with advanced disease. By the time the first symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing) appear, the disease has already progressed. The overall five-year survival rate (5YSR) in the United States is around 15%, with most people dying within the first year of diagnosis. The latest survival data for England and Wales (patients diagnosed during 2007) show that only one in ten people survive esophageal cancer for at least ten years. Individualized prognosis depends largely on stage. Those with cancer restricted entirely to the esophageal mucosa have about an 80% 5YSR, but submucosal involvement brings this down to less than 50%. Extension into the muscularis propria (muscle layer of the esophagus) suggests a 20% 5YSR, and extension to the structures adjacent to the esophagus predict a 7% 5YSR. Patients with distant metastases (who are not candidates for curative surgery) have a less than 3% 5YSR. Epidemiology Death from esophageal cancer per million persons in 2012 Esophageal cancer is the eighth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, and because of its poor prognosis it is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death. It caused about 400,000 deaths in 2012, accounting for about 5% of all cancer deaths (about 456,000 new cases were diagnosed, representing about 3% of all cancers). ESCC (esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma) comprises 60‚Äì70% of all cases of esophageal cancer worldwide, while EAC (esophageal adenocarcinoma) accounts for a further 20‚Äì30% (melanomas, leiomyosarcomas, carcinoids and lymphomas are less common types). The incidence of the two main types of esophageal cancer varies greatly between different geographical areas. In general, ESCC is more common in the developing world, and EAC is more common in the developed world. The worldwide incidence rate of ESCC in 2012 was 5.2 new cases per 100,000 person-years, with a male predominance (7.7 per 100,000 in men vs. 2.8 in women). It was the common type in 90% of the countries studied. ESCC is particularly frequent in the so-called \\"Asian esophageal cancer belt\\", an area that passes through northern China, southern Russia, north-eastern Iran, northern Afghanistan and eastern Turkey. In 2012, about 80% of ESCC cases worldwide occurred in central and south-eastern Asia, and over half (53%) of all cases were in China. The countries with the highest estimated national incidence rates were (in Asia) Mongolia and Turkmenistan and (in Africa) Malawi, Kenya and Uganda. The problem of esophageal cancer has long been recognized in the eastern and southern parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, where ESCC appears to predominate. In Western countries, EAC has become the dominant form of the disease, following an increase in incidence over recent decades (in contrast to the incidence of ESCC, which has remained largely stable). In 2012, the global incidence rate for EAC was 0.7 per 100,000 with a strong male predominance (1.1 per 100,000 in men vs. 0.3 in women). Areas with particularly high incidence rates include northern and western Europe, North America and Oceania. The countries with highest recorded rates were the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland and New Zealand. =United States= In the United States, esophageal cancer is the seventh-leading cause of cancer death among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute estimated there were about 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer in 2013 (the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new esophageal cancer cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths). The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common among African American males with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted for the vast majority of esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett's esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in Caucasian men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 2002. This increase was found in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics and became predominant in non-Hispanic whites. Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates for African Americans continue to be higher than the rate for Causasians. However, incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer has significantly decreased among African Americans since the early 1980s, whereas with Caucasians it has continued to increase. Between 1975 and 2004, incidence of the adenocarcinoma type increased among white American males by over 460% and among white American females by 335%. =United Kingdom= The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has risen considerably in the UK in recent decades. Overall, esophageal cancer is the thirteenth most common cancer in the UK (around 8,300 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the sixth most common cause of cancer death (around 7,700 people died in 2012).  Society and culture  = Notable cases = Humphrey Bogart, actor, died of esophageal cancer in 1957, aged 57. Christopher Hitchens, author and journalist, died of esophageal cancer in 2011, aged 62. Morrissey in October 2015 stated he has the disease and describes his experience when he first heard he had it. Research directions The risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma may be reduced in people using aspirin or related NSAIDs, but in the absence of randomized controlled trials the current evidence is inconclusive.

He started working for The Washington Post as a reporter in 1971 and currently holds the title of associate editor.\\"Bob Woodward\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved September 4, 2018. While a young reporter for The Washington Post in 1972, Woodward teamed up with Carl Bernstein; the two did much of the original news reporting on the Watergate scandal. These scandals led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. The work of Woodward and Bernstein was called \\"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time\\" by journalist Gene Roberts.Roy J. Harris, Jr., Pulitzer's Gold, 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, . Woodward continued to work for The Washington Post after his reporting on Watergate. He has since written 19 books on American politics, 13 of which have topped best-seller lists. Early life, education and naval service Woodward was born in Geneva, Illinois, the son of Jane (n√©e Upshur) and Alfred E. Woodward, a lawyer who later became chief judge of the 18th Judicial Circuit Court. He was raised in nearby Wheaton, Illinois, and educated at Wheaton Community High School (WCHS), a public high school in the same town. His parents divorced when he was twelve, and he and his brother and sister were raised by their father, who subsequently remarried.Barbara Matusow. \\"The Secretive Man Who Gleans Other's Secrets\\". Newsday, September 18, 1987, p. 2. Following graduation from WCHS in 1961, Woodward enrolled in Yale College with a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship and studied history and English literature. While at Yale, Woodward joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and was a member of the secret society Book and Snake. He received his B.A. degree in 1965. After Yale, Woodward began a five-year tour of duty in the United States Navy. During his service in the Navy, Woodward served aboard the USS Wright, and was one of two officers assigned to move or handle nuclear launch codes the Wright carried in its capacity as a National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA). At one time, he was close to Admiral Robert O. Welander, being communications officer on the USS Fox under Welander's command.Jack Williams, U-T San Diego, July 29, 2005, Adm. Robert O. Welander, 80; flotilla CO and Joint Chiefs aide Career After being discharged as a lieutenant in August 1970, Woodward was admitted to Harvard Law School but elected not to attend. Instead, he applied for a job as a reporter for The Washington Post while taking graduate courses in Shakespeare and international relations at George Washington University. Harry M. Rosenfeld, the Post's metropolitan editor, gave him a two-week trial but did not hire him because of his lack of journalistic experience. After a year at the Montgomery Sentinel, a weekly newspaper in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Woodward was hired as a Post reporter in 1971.Woodward, Bob, The Secret Man, pp. 17‚Äì20, 27‚Äì35, Simon and Schuster, 2005 =Watergate= Woodward and Carl Bernstein were both assigned to report on the June 17, 1972, burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in a Washington, D.C., office building called Watergate. Their work, under editor Ben Bradlee, became known for being the first to report on a number of political \\"dirty tricks\\" used by the Nixon re-election committee during his campaign for re-election. Their book about the scandal, All the President's Men, became a No. 1 bestseller and was later turned into a movie. The 1976 film, starring Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in investigative journalism. The book and movie also led to the enduring mystery of the identity of Woodward's secret Watergate informant known as Deep Throat, a reference to the title of a popular pornographic movie at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat's identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For more than 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant's identity until it was claimed by his family to Vanity Fair magazine to be former Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director W. Mark Felt in May 2005. Woodward immediately confirmed the veracity of this claim and subsequently published a book, titled The Secret Man, that detailed his relationship with Felt. Woodward and Bernstein followed up All the President‚Äôs Men with a second book on Watergate, entitled The Final Days (Simon and Schuster 1976), covering in extensive depth the period from November 1973 until President Nixon resigned in August 1974. The Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. = \\"Jimmy's World\\" scandal = In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the Post titled \\"Jimmy's World\\" in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the Post doubted the story's veracity, it was defended by the paper's editors including Woodward, who was assistant managing editor. It was Woodward who submitted the story for Pulitzer Prize consideration, and Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned. In retrospect, Woodward made the following statement: =1996 campaign finance controversy= China's alleged role in the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy first gained public attention when Woodward and Brian Duffy published a story stating that a United States Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, \\"Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed\\", Washington Post, February 13, 1997 =George W. Bush administration= Woodward spent more time than any other journalist with former President George W. Bush, interviewing him six times for close to 11 hours total.\\"The War Within\\" p. 443 Woodward's four books, Bush at War (2002), Plan of Attack (2004), State of Denial (2006), and The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006‚Äì2008) (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the September 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and Dan Balz described the events at Camp David in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the Worldwide Attack Matrix. Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on Larry King Live, he was asked by a telephone caller, \\"Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no weapons of mass destruction\\", Woodward responded \\"I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There's just too much there.\\" Woodward later admitted his error saying, \\"I think I dropped the ball here. I should have pushed much, much harder on the skepticism about the reality of WMD; in other words, [I should have] said, 'Hey, look, the evidence is not as strong as they were claiming.'\\" In 2008, as a part of the Google Talks series, Woodward, who was interviewed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said that he had a fourth book in his Bush at War series in the making. He then added jokingly that his wife had told him that she would kill him if he decides to write a fifth in the series. Involvement in the Plame scandal On November 14, 2005, Woodward gave a two-hour deposition to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that Iraq war critic Joe Wilson's wife (later identified as Valerie Plame), worked for the CIA as a WMD analyst, not as an undercover operative. Woodward appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in The Washington Post on November 16, 2005, and was the first time Woodward revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Woodward testified the information was given to him in a \\"casual\\" and \\"offhand\\" manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to \\"out\\" Plame as a CIA employee. Later, Woodward's source identified himself. It was Richard Armitage, Colin Powell's deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle. Woodward said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book Plan of Attack. He did not reveal the official's disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source. In his deposition, Woodward also said that he had conversations with Scooter Libby after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about Joe Wilson's wife before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known. Woodward apologized to Leonard Downie Jr., editor of The Washington Post, for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting. New York University professor Jay Rosen severely criticized Woodward for allegedly being co-opted by the Bush White House and also for not telling the truth about his role in the Plame affair, writing: \\"Not only is Woodward not in the hunt, but he is slowly turning into the hunted. Part of what remains to be uncovered is how Woodward was played by the Bush team, and what they thought they were doing by leaking to him, as well as what he did with the dubious information he got.\\"Jay Rosen, \\"Murray Waas Is Our Woodward Now\\" , PressThink (blog), April 9, 2006, accessed June 21, 2007 =Other professional activities= Although Woodward is no longer employed by the Post, Woodward has continued to write books and report stories for The Washington Post, and has the title of associate editor at the paper, which was described by Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan as honorific with no regular responsibilities. He focuses on the presidency, intelligence, and Washington institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court, The Pentagon, and the Federal Reserve. He also wrote the book Wired, about the Hollywood drug culture and the death of comic John Belushi. In 2018, Woodward announced participation in an online class on investigative journalism. =Sequester dispute with Obama administration= On February 22, 2013, shortly before the United States federal budget sequester took effect, The Washington Post published a column by Woodward in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the sequester had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Woodward said his research showed that the sequester proposal had originated with the White House. Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed, \\"The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.\\" On February 27, Woodward told Politico that before the column was published, Woodward had called a senior White House official, later identified by reporters as economic adviser Gene Sperling, to discuss the piece, and that the official had \\"yelled at [Woodward] for about a half-hour\\" before sending him a page- long email that included the sentence, \\"I think you will regret staking out that claim.\\" In Politico's reporting, Woodward's focus on that line was described as \\"making clear he saw [that sentence] as a veiled threat\\", although Woodward did not use the word \\"threat\\" or \\"threatened\\". Several other sources also indicated that Woodward had expressed the line as an intended threat. The next day, Politico published the complete email exchange between Woodward and Sperling. Sperling's statements leading up to the \\"regret\\" line read: \\"But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.\\" The White House subsequently released a statement that \\"of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more.\\" Upon release of the emails, several conservative commentators indicated they no longer agreed with characterizing the \\"regret\\" statement as a threat. In a February 28 Fox News Channel interview, Woodward said he had never used the word \\"threat\\" but said Sperling's conduct was \\"not the way to operate in a White House\\". He also said: \\"I've been flooded with emails from people in the press saying this is exactly the way the White House works, they are trying to control and they don't want to be challenged or crossed\\". National Journal editor Ron Fournier, conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, and Fox News contributor and former Clinton adviser Lanny Davis expressed support for Woodward; Fournier and Davis described similar experiences with Obama administration officials. Career recognition and awards Although not a recipient in his own right, Woodward made contributions to two Pulitzer Prizes won by The Washington Post. First, he and Bernstein were the lead reporters on Watergate and the Post won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. He was also the main reporter for the Posts coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Post won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for 10 of its stories on the subject. Woodward at the National Press Club in 2002 Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award, including the Heywood Broun award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), Sigma Delta Chi Award (1973), George Polk Award (1972), William Allen White Medal (2000), and the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). In 2012, Colby College presented Woodward with the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate. Woodward has authored or co-authored 18 nonfiction books in the past 35 years. All 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers‚Äîmore No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. In his 1995 memoir, A Good Life, former Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Woodward in the foreword. \\"It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodward‚Äîsurely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen.... And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate.\\"Ben Bradlee, A Good Life, 1995, pp. 12‚Äì13, New York: Simon and Schuster, . See also pp. 324‚Äì384. In 1995, Woodward also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. David Gergen, who had worked in the White House during the Richard Nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, Eyewitness to Power, of Woodward's reporting, \\"I don't accept everything he writes as gospel‚Äîhe can get details wrong‚Äîbut generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest.\\"David Gergen, Eyewitness to Power, 2000, p. 71, New York: Simon and Schuster, . In 2001, Woodward won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard called Woodward \\"the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever.\\"Fred Barnes, \\"The White House at War,\\" The Weekly Standard, December 12, 9002, In 2003, Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal called Woodward \\"the most celebrated journalist of our age.\\" In 2004, Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, \\"Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time.\\"Bob Schieffer, \\"The Best Reporter of All Time,\\" CBS News, April 18, 2004, In 2014, Robert Gates former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, said that he wished he'd recruited Woodward into the CIA, saying, \\"He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill [their] guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.\\" Criticism =Style= Woodward often uses unnamed sources in his reporting for the Post and in his books. Using extensive interviews with firsthand witnesses, documents, meeting notes, diaries, calendars, and other documentation, Woodward attempts to construct a seamless narrative of events, most often told through the eyes of the key participants. Nicholas von Hoffman has made the criticism that \\"arrestingly irrelevant detail is [often] used\\",Nicholas von Hoffman, \\"Unasked Questions,\\" The New York Review of Books, June 10, 1976, Vol. 23, Number 10. while Michael Massing believes Woodward's books are \\"filled with long, at times tedious passages with no evident direction.\\"Michael Massing, \\"Sitting on Top of the News,\\" The New York Review of Books, June 27, 1991, Vol. 38, Number 12. Joan Didion published a comprehensive criticism of Woodward in a lengthy September 1996 essay in The New York Review of Books.Joan Didion, \\"The Deferential Spirit,\\" The New York Review of Books, September 19, 1996, Vol. 43, Number 14. Though \\"Woodward is a widely trusted reporter, even an American icon\\", she says that he assembles reams of often irrelevant detail, fails to draw conclusions, and make judgments. \\"Measurable cerebral activity is virtually absent\\" from his books after Watergate from 1979 to 1996, she said. She said the books are notable for \\"a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured.\\" She ridicules \\"fairness\\" as \\"a familiar newsroom piety, the excuse in practice for a good deal of autopilot reporting and lazy thinking.\\" All this focus on what people said and thought‚Äîtheir \\"decent intentions\\"‚Äîcircumscribes \\"possible discussion or speculation\\", resulting in what she called \\"political pornography\\". The Post's Richard Harwood defended Woodward in a September 6, 1996, column, arguing that Woodward's method is that of a reporter‚Äî\\"talking to people you write about, checking and cross- checking their versions of contemporary history,\\" and collecting documentary evidence in notes, letters, and records.\\"Richard Harwood, \\"Deconstructing Bob Woodward,\\" The Washington Post, September 6, 1996, p. A23. =Content= *Woodward has been accused of exaggeration and fabrication regarding \\"Deep Throat\\", his Watergate informant. After W. Mark Felt was announced as the true identity behind Deep Throat in 2005, John Dean and Ed Gray, in separate publications, used Woodward's book All The President's Men and his published notes on his meetings with Deep Throat to argue that Deep Throat could not have been only Mark Felt. They argued that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only one of whom was Felt. Gray, in his book In Nixon's Web, even went so far as to publish an e-mail and telephone exchange he had with Donald Santarelli, a Washington lawyer who was a Justice Department official during Watergate, in which Santarelli confirmed to Gray that he was the source behind statements Woodward recorded in notes he has attributed to Deep Throat. However, Stephen Mielke, an archivist at the University of Texas who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein papers, said it is likely the page was misfiled under Felt because no source was identified. The original page of notes is in the Mark Felt file but \\"the carbon is located with the handwritten and typed notes attributed to Santarelli.\\" Ed Gray said that Santarelli confirmed to him that he was the source behind the statements in the notes.Stephen Mielke (Archivist), finding aid in Woodward's handwritten and typed interview notes, 1972‚Äì73, in the Watergate Papers at the Harry Ransom Center, The University of Texas at Austin *J. Bradford DeLong has noted considerable inconsistencies between the accounts of the making of Clinton economic policy described in Woodward's book Maestro and his book The Agenda. *Some of Woodward's critics accuse him of abandoning critical inquiry to maintain his access to high-profile political actors. Anthony Lewis called the style \\"a trade in which the great grant access in return for glory.\\" Christopher Hitchens accused Woodward of acting as \\"stenographer to the rich and powerful.\\" *Writer Tanner Colby, who co-wrote a biography of John Belushi with the late actor's widow Judy, wrote in Slate that, while Woodward's frequently criticized 1984 book Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi is largely accurate in its description of events, Woodward either gets the context wrong or does not find any context at all. For example, Belushi's grandmother's funeral, which led him to make a serious effort to sober up, gets merely a paragraph in Woodward's retelling, while a 24-hour drug binge in Los Angeles goes on for eight pages simply because the limo driver was willing to talk to Woodward. \\"It's like someone wrote a biography of Michael Jordan in which all the stats and scores are correct, but you come away with the impression that Michael Jordan wasn't very good at playing basketball,\\" he concluded. Because it was unique among Woodward's books in that it made no use of confidential or anonymous sources, Colby was able to interview many of the same sources that Woodward had used, making comparisons of their recollection of events to Woodward's accounting of them relatively easy. *Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the war, and the publication of the book At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA by former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet led Woodward to engage in a rather tortuous account of the extent of his pre-war conversations with Tenet in an article in The New Yorker in which he also chastised New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd for being critical of him. *Woodward was also accused of fabricating a deathbed interview with CIA Director William Casey, as described in Veil. Critics say the interview simply could not have taken place as written in the book. Robert M. Gates, Casey's deputy at the time, in his book From the Shadows, recounts speaking with Casey during this exact period. Gates directly quotes Casey saying 22 words, even more than the 19 words Woodward said Casey used with him. The CIA's internal report found that Casey \\"had forty-three meetings or phone calls with Woodward, including a number of meetings at Casey's home with no one else present\\" during the period Woodward was researching his book. Gates was also quoted saying, \\"When I saw him in the hospital, his speech was even more slurred than usual, but if you knew him well, you could make out a few words, enough to get sense of what he was saying.\\" Following Casey's death, President Ronald Reagan wrote: \\"[Woodward]'s a liar and he lied about what Casey is supposed to have thought of me.\\" Commentator David Frum has said that Washington officials can learn something about the way Washington works from Woodward's books: \\"From his books, you can draw a composite profile of the powerful Washington player. That person is highly circumspect, highly risk averse, eschews new ideas, flatters his colleagues to their face (while trashing them to Woodward behind their backs), and is always careful to avoid career-threatening confrontation. We all admire heroes, but Woodward's books teach us that those who rise to leadership are precisely those who take care to abjure heroism for themselves.\\" Frum, David, \\"David Frum's Diary\\" blog, at the National Review Online Web site, October 5, 2006, post \\"Blogging Woodward\\" Despite these criticisms and challenges, Woodward has been praised as an authoritative and balanced journalist. The New York Times Book Review said in 2004 that \\"No reporter has more talent for getting Washington's inside story and telling it cogently.\\" Lecture circuit As of 2008, Woodward was giving speeches on the \\"lecture circuit\\" to industry lobbying groups, such as the American Bankruptcy Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Mortgage Bankers Association. Woodward was commanding speaking fees \\"rang[ing] from $15,000 to $60,000\\" and donating them to his personal foundation, the Woodward Walsh Foundation, which donated to charities including Sidwell Friends School. Washington Post policy prohibits \\"speaking engagements without permission from department heads\\" but Woodward insisted that the policy is \\"fuzzy and ambiguous\\".

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 September 2017 Papacy While still only pope-elect, John, with the other bishops of the Catholic Church, wrote to the clergy of Ireland and Scotland to tell them of the mistakes they were making with regard to the time of keeping Easter, and exhort them to be on their guard against the Pelagian heresy. About the same time, he condemned Monothelism as heresy. Emperor Heraclius immediately disowned the Monothelite document known as the \\"Ecthesis\\". To Heraclius' son, Constantine III, John addressed his apology for Pope Honorius I, in which he deprecated the attempt to connect the name of Honorius with Monothelism. Honorius, he declared, in speaking of one will in Jesus, only meant to assert that there were not two contrary wills in Him. Troubles in his native land caused by invasions of Slavs directed John's attention there. To alleviate the distress of the inhabitants, John sent the abbot Martin into Dalmatia and Istria with large sums of money for the redemption of captives. As the ruined churches could not be rebuilt, the relics of some of the more important Dalmatian saints were brought to Rome. John then erected an oratory in their honour. It was adorned by the pope with mosaics depicting John himself holding in his hands a model of his oratory. John endeavoured thereby to convert the Slavs in Dalmatia and Istria to Christianity. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus claimed that Duke Porga of Croatia, who had been invited into Dalmatia by Heraclius, sent to Emperor Heraclius for Christian teachers. It is supposed that the emperor to whom this message was sent was Emperor Heraclius himself, and that he sent it to Pope John IV. John was buried in the Basilica of St. Peter.

It is found in Standard, Miniature, and Toy sizes. The Xolo also comes in a coated variety and coated and hairless can be born in the same litter. It is characterized by its lack of hair, wrinkles, and dental abnormalities. In Nahuatl, from which its name originates, its name is x≈çl≈çitzcuintli (singular) and x≈çl≈çitzcuintin (plural).Nahuatl Dictionary. (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 1, 2012, from link The name comes from the god Xolotl and itzcuƒ´ntli , meaning dog in Nahuatl. Lineage A 1999 genetic study using mitochondrial DNA found that the DNA sequences of the Xoloitzcuintle were identical to those of dogs from the Old World. This early study did not find a close genetic relationship between the Xoloitzcuintle and the Chinese Crested Dog, another hairless breed that is cited by the American Kennel Club as an ancestor to the Xoloitzcuintle. In 2018, an analysis of DNA from the entire genome indicated that domesticated dogs entered North America from Siberia for 4,500 years and were isolated for the next 9,000 years. After contact with Europeans, these lineages were replaced by Eurasian dogs and their local descendants, like the Xoloitzcuintle. The pre-contact dogs exhibited a unique genetic signature that is now gone. Their phenotype is a consequence of canine ectodermal dysplasia caused by a mutation on the Foxl3 autosomal gene. History Colima dog Archaeological evidence has been found in Colima dating similar dogs to over 3500 years ago. Long regarded as guardians and protectors, the indigenous peoples believed that the Xolo would safeguard the home from evil spirits as well as intruders. Ceramic representations of the Xolo, known as Colima dogs, have been found in hundreds of burial sites. In ancient times, Xolos were often sacrificed and then buried with their owners to act as guides to the soul on its journey to the underworld. They have been found in burial sites of both the Maya and the Toltec. These dogs were considered a great delicacy, and were consumed for sacrificial ceremonies‚Äìincluding marriages and funerals. Most likely, these pre-European dogs originated as spontaneous hairless mutations of indigenous American dogs. Hairlessness may have conferred a survival advantage in tropical regions.The indigenous peoples of Mexico had Xolos as home and hunting companions, and today they are still very popular companion dogs. Their value in ancient native cultures is evidenced by their frequent appearance in art and artifacts. Artist Diego Rivera with a Xoloitzquintle at the Casa Azul Pre-European Xolos were considered sacred dogs by the Aztecs, Toltecs, Mayans, and other groups. They were also useful companion animals. According to Aztec mythology, the god Xolotl made the Xoloitzcuintli from a sliver of the Bone of Life from which all mankind was made. Xolotl gave this gift to Man with the instruction to guard it with his life and in exchange it would guide Man through the dangers of Mictlan, the world of Death, toward the Evening Star in the Heavens. Some people in Mexico continue to believe this breed has healing qualities. Sixteenth-century Spanish accounts tell of large numbers of dogs being served at banquets.Coe, Sophie D. (1994) America's first cuisines Aztec merchant feasts could have 80‚Äì100 turkeys and 20‚Äì40 dogs served as food. When these two meats were served in the same dish, the dog meat was at the bottom of the dish, either because it was held in higher regard or because it was increasingly considered a step above cannibalism.Aguilar-Moreno, M. (2006). Handbook to life in the Aztec world. Oxford University Press: USA. p. 329 The Aztecs consumed few domesticated animals like Xolos or turkeys. Over 90% of the bones found at archeological sites are of deer that were hunted. The breed is not historically well known in the United States. As a result, the Xolo has been mistaken for the mythical Chupacabras of Mexico. On August 12, 2016, the Mayor of Mexico City Miguel √Ångel Mancera designated the Xoloitzcuintle as a \\"cultural heritage and symbol\\" of Mexico City. Registry =F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI)= Despite the Xolo's more than 3,000-year history in Mexico, the breed did not receive any official notice in its homeland until the 1950s. The FCI, founded in 1940, was not prepared to declare the Xolo an official purebred at that time. According to breed historian Norman Pelham Wright, author of The Enigma of the Xoloitzcuintli, Xolos began to turn up at Mexican dog shows in the late 1940s. Although they were recognized as indigenous specimens of a native breed, interest in them was minimal at that time, because information was scarce and no standard existed by which to judge them. Within a decade, the FCI realized that the breed would become extinct if drastic action were not taken to save it. This led to the widely publicized Xolo Expedition of 1954. With the official sanction of the FCI, Wright and a team of Mexican and British dog authorities set off to discover if any purebred Xolos still existed in remote areas of Mexico. Eventually 10 structurally strong Xolos were found and these dogs formed the foundation of Mexico's program to revive the breed. A committee headed by Wright authored the first official standard for the breed; on May 1, 1956, the Xolo was finally recognized in its native land and, as Mexico is a member of the FCI, worldwide. =American Kennel Club (AKC)= A toy Xoloitzcuintle Xolos were among the first breeds recorded by the American Kennel Club (AKC). A Mexican dog named 'Mee Too' made breed history as the first AKC-registered Xolo in 1887. 'Chinito Junior', bred and owned by Valetska Radtke of New York City, became the breed's only AKC champion to date. He earned his title on October 19, 1940. In 1959, the Xolo was dropped from the AKC stud book due to the breed's scarcity and perceived extinction. The Xoloitzcuintli Club of America (XCA) was founded in October 1986 to regain AKC recognition for the breed. On May 13, 2008, AKC voted to readmit the breed to its Miscellaneous Class starting January 1, 2009. The XCA is the official parent club for the breed, founded on October 26, 1986, for the purpose of regaining AKC recognition for the Xoloitzcuintli. The founding members voted unanimously to recognize all three sizes (toy, miniature and standard) and both varieties (hairless and coated) at their initial meeting. Since then, the XCA has compiled a stud book modeled on requirements for eventual AKC acceptance, held an annual independent specialty show, published a quarterly newsletter, The Xolo News, and maintained an active national rescue network, National Xolo Rescue (known before 2009 as The Xolo Rescue LeagueNational Xolo Rescue at the XCA website). Since January 1, 2007, FSS registered Xolos have been eligible to compete in AKC performance events. The breed was moved into the AKC Studbook in December 2010 and has been eligible to be shown in the AKC Non-Sporting group since January 1, 2011.Xolo News at AKC.org The first AKC Group Winning Xolo was Bayshore Mole who won a Group 4 placement February 2, 2011, and this was followed by his littermate Bayshore Georgio Armani receiving back to back group placement. On August 8, 2011, Bayshore Georgio Armani became the first Xolo to be named Best in Show in AKC competition. Bayshore Mole became the first Xolo to win back to back Best in Shows on September 3 and 4, 2011. Both dogs were bred by Bayshore Kennel in Virginia. In February 2012, the Xolo was one of six new breeds to make their first appearance at the Westminster Dog Show. Characteristics =Appearance= Giorgio Armani, the first Xoloitzcuintle to be named best of its breed at the Westminster Dog Show. He has achieved four Bests in Show and 27 Group Firsts since joining the American Kennel Club's Non-Sporting Group in January 2011. The breed ranges in size from about 10 to 55 lb (5 to 23 kg). The height is 9 to 26 inches (23-67 cm). Similar in appearance to a Pharaoh Hound, with a sleek body, almond-shaped eyes, large bat-like ears, and a long neck, the Xolo is notable for its dominant trait of hairlessness. The dominant hairless trait originated in this breed as a spontaneous mutation thousands of years ago. The recessive expression of the trait will produce a coated variety, which is genetically inseparable from the hairless, as the homozygous appearance of the hairless mutation is fatal to the unborn pup. Most litters contain both hairless and coated puppies. The coated variety, covered with a short, flat dense coat represents the original form of the dog, prior to the occurrence of the spontaneous hairless mutation. The hairless variety is completely hairless on the body, with many dogs exhibiting a few short hairs on the top of the head, the toes, and the tip of the tail. Most hairless dogs are black or bluish-gray in color. The allele responsible for the Xolo's hairlessness also affects the dog's dentition: Hairless Xolos typically have an incomplete set of teeth while the dogs of the coated variety have complete dentition. The Xolo is moderate in all aspects of its appearance, conveying an impression of strength, agility, and elegance. Xolo body proportions are rectangular, slightly longer in total body length than the height measured at the highest point of the withers (top of the shoulders). The breed occurs naturally in two varieties, hairless and coated. Hairless Xolos are the dominant expression of the heterozygous Hh hairless trait. Coated Xolos (hh) are the recessive expression, and breeding hairless to coated or hairless to hairless may produce pups of either or both varieties. Breeding coated to coated will only produce coated pups because they are recessive to the hairless trait and do not carry the dominant H gene. Both varieties occur in all hair or skin colors, and the skin is often marked, splashed, or spotted. The most common colors are various shades termed black, grey, bronze, yellowish-blonde, blue, and red. The breed occurs in a range of sizes, which breeders have standardized into three designations: Standard, Miniature and Toy. =Temperament= Hairless and coated Xoloitzquintles The Xoloitzcuintle's 'primitive' temperament (very high intelligence, sensitivity, high energy, inquisitiveness, strong hunting, and social instincts) is apparent because the breed's temperament was not modified overall by selective breeding in their native history in Mexico. This has also ensured a sturdy physical nature and vigorous health generally innate in both coated and uncoated Xolos. Adult Xolos are frequently noted for their calm demeanor, although puppies can be extremely energetic, noisy, and very oral until they reach maturity (after 2 years old) and do not bark much, after which they tend to settle down and become more calm. Inadequately supervised or exercised Xolos can become escape artists, climbing and jumping fences to chase. Many individuals of this breed can possess guard dog ability and will not back down from a fight. At the same time, adult dogs, when they are raised properly, can become steady, well- behaved, and affectionate companions. Though physically grown at one year, many dog breeds including Xolos, are not 'emotionally mature' until around two years. Like active breeds such as terriers, Xolos need calm, consistent, and loving obedience training and regular socialization during their growing years. Well-raised Xolos bond strongly with their owners, becoming highly devoted to their families while frequently choosing one specific family member as favorite. A newborn Xoloitzcuintle Anyone considering acquiring a Xolo should expect to spend time educating themselves in positive reinforcement dog training techniques, and, ideally, should have prior experience with active and intelligent dog breeds. A spacious, well-fenced, and safe physical environment is desirable for this breed. Daily walks are ideal for exercising most toy-sized Xolos; however, more stimulating physical and mental exercise is advised for larger and more active individuals. Behavior problems in Xolos are typically a result of a dog receiving inadequate or inconsistent supervision, as well as inadequate exercise and mental stimulation. The Xoloitzcuintle is a social dog that should not, in most cases, be an \\"only dog\\". It does not do well when kept as an outside-only dog. This is a breed that is at its best when it is made part of the family, receiving regular interaction and socialization with its humans (and other dogs, whether present in the home or as regular playmates). =Health= The Xolo has been developed by natural selection for thousands of years, and is therefore generally not prone to health and structure problems as other dog breeds more modified by human selection efforts. Xolos came from tropical climates and are not suited for outdoor life in colder temperate and northern climates; they should be considered an indoor dog breed. They need bathing, light grooming, and skin care as with other dogs of similar physical type, or acne can result. Most skin problems arise from poor breeding, neglect, or over-bathing and over- lotioning, stripping natural protections and clogging pores.

He was the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy consecrated without prior imperial consent, and the first in a line of ten consecutive popes of Eastern origin. His papacy was marked by reconciliation between the city of Rome and the Empire.  Early life  John was born in Antioch.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 210. On account of speaking Greek, he was named papal legate to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680.  Papacy  John V was the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy consecrated without the direct imperial approval. Emperor Constantine IV had done away with the requirement during the pontificate of Benedict II, John V's predecessor, providing that \\"the one elected to the Apostolic See may be ordained pontiff from that moment and without delay\\".Ekonomou, 2007, p. 215. In a return to the \\"ancient practice\\", John V was elected in July 685 \\"by the general population\\" of Rome.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 247. Constantine IV doubtlessly trusted that the population and clergy of Rome had been sufficiently Easternized, and indeed the next ten pontiffs were of Eastern descent. John V's papacy saw a continuation of improving relations with Byzantium. The Emperor greatly reduced taxes on the papal patrimonies of Sicily and Calabria and abolished other taxes, such as a surtax on grain that had been paid only with difficulty in recent years.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 217. A letter from Justinian II assured John V that a \\"synod of high-ranking civil and ecclesiastical officials\\", including the apocrisiarius and the Byzantine military, had read and thereafter sealed the text of the Third Council of Constantinople, to prevent any alteration to its canons.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 219. The letter was addressed to \\"John pope of the city of Rome\\", written while the Emperor believed the pope to still be alive, but received by Pope Conon.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 239. Like his immediate predecessors, John V was unusually generous towards the diaconies of Rome, distributing 1,900 solidi to \\"all the clergy, the monastic diaconies, and the mansionarii\\" for the poor.  Death  After a pontificate of little more than a year, John V died in his bed in August 686, giving rise to a \\"heated debate over his successor\\". The clergy favored an archpriest named Peter, while the army supported another priest, Theodore.Ekonomou, 2007, p. 216. The faction of the clergy gathered outside the Constantinian basilica and the faction of the military met in the Church of St. Stephen. Shuttle diplomacy proved futile and eventually the clergy elected Conon, a Greco-Sicilian. John V was buried among the papal tombs in Old St. Peter's Basilica.Reardon, Wendy J. 2004. The Deaths of the Popes. Macfarland & Company, Inc. . pp. 55‚Äì56. His inscription praised him for combating Monothelitism at the Third Council of Constantinople \\"with the titles of the faith, keeping such vigilance, you united the minds so that the inimical wolf mixing in might not seize the sheep, or the more powerful crush those below\\".Ekonomou, 2007, p. 243.

Further collaborations with Gaiman produced the graphic novels Signal to Noise in 1992 previously serialised in The Face magazine, about a dying filmmaker and his hypothetical last film; and The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch, which explored similar themes as Violent Cases through the imagery of the Punch and Judy show. In 1995 McKean wrote and illustrated a book for The Rolling Stones called Voodoo Lounge to tie-in with the release of their album of the same name. Between 1990 and 1996, McKean wrote and drew the ten issues of Cages, an ambitious graphic novel about artists and creativity, illustrated in a stripped-down pen-and-ink style influenced by Alberto Breccia, Jos√© Antonio Mu√±oz and Lorenzo Mattotti. Cages was published as single volume by Kitchen Sink Press in 1998, and in a new edition by NBM Publishing in 2002. In 2010, Cages was released by Dark Horse Comics in paperback. An anniversary edition was released in 2016 by the same publisher, featuring a new introduction by Terry Gilliam. McKean's collections of short comics Pictures That Tick, and Pictures That Tick 2: Exhibition were published by Dark Horse Comics in 2009 and 2015. Pictures That Tick won the Victoria and Albert Museum Illustrated Book of the Year award. McKean created a wordless erotic graphic novel called Celluloid for Delcourt, which was published in the United States by Fantagraphics Books. Black Dog: The Dreams of Paul Nash, which was a commission by the 14-18 Now Foundation, The Imperial War Museum and The Lakes International Comic art Festival, was released as an artist's edition in June 2016, and was published in October 2016 by Dark Horse Comics as an oversized hardback and regular paperback. The project was also a live performance featuring cellist/singer Matthew Sharp and violinist Clare Haythornthwaite, and was performed in Amiens, Kendal, London, Rye and Ashford. = Illustration = McKean designed the posters for the Raindance Film Festival for five consecutive years between 1996‚Äì2000. In 1997 he wrote, directed and edited a ninety-second trailer for the festival. In 2005, McKean designed the poster for the 32nd Telluride Film Festival. In 2006, he designed projections, sets and directed film clips for the Broadway musical Lestat, adapted from Anne Rice's novels, with music and lyrics by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. McKean has created a few books documenting his travels using only illustrations. Examples include Postcards from Vienna, Postcards from Barcelona, Postcards from Paris (2008), Postcards from Brussels (2009), Postcards from Perugia (2011), Postcards from Bilbao (2012).

In the middle of the image a copepod escapes successfully to the left. The ecoSCOPE is an optical sensor system, deployed from a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or fibre optic cable, to investigate behavior and microdistribution of small organisms in the ocean. Deployment Although an ROV may be very small and quiet, it is impossible to approach feeding herring closer than 40 cm. The ecoSCOPE allows observation of feeding herring from a distance of only 4 cm. From 40 cm, the herrings' prey (copepods) in front of the herring are invisible due to the deflection of light by phytoplankton and microparticles in highly productive waters where herring live. With the ecoSCOPE, the predators are illuminated by natural light, the prey by a light sheet, projected via a second endoscope from strobed LEDs (2 ms, 100% relative intensity at 700 nm, 53% at 690 nm, 22% at 680 nm, 4% at 660 nm, 0% at 642 nm). By imitating the long, thin snout of the garfish protruding into the security sphere of the alert herrings, an endoscope with a tip diameter of 11 mm is used. The endoscope is camouflaged to reduce the brightness-contrast against the background: the top is black and the sides are silvery. Additionally, the front of the ROV is covered by a mirror, reflecting a light gradient resembling the natural scene and making the instrument body virtually invisible to the animals. A second sensor images other copepods, phytoplankton and particles at very high magnification. Another advantage of these small \\"optical probes\\" is the minimal disruption of the current-field in the measuring volume, allowing for less disturbed surveys of microturbulence and shear. Another video can be seen in the article for Atlantic herring. An ecoSCOPE was also deployed to measure the dynamics of particles in a polluted estuary: see image on Particle (ecology), another as an underwater environmental monitoring system, utilizing the orientation capacity of juvenile glasseel.

Image:ECORAN42.JPGThe little tube extending from the nose is visible Image:Filterkrillkils2.gifFilter feeding of Antarctic krill, slowed to 1/12th of actual speed Specifications The ecoSCOPE is a product of the new initiative of \\"Ocean Online Biosensors\\": a synthesis of IT-sensoric and the sensing capability of ocean organisms. The twelve exits on the sides and the entrance in the middle, in front of a CD for comparison Depicted in the image on the right is the central unit. On all four corners are small entrances, through which water from different sources enters (in this case, rivers and creeks in New Jersey). It flows through a small labyrinth and mixes in the central chamber. It exits through a small tube in the middle. The glasseels migrate through this small tube heading into the current. In the middle is the entrance for the eels. They test the different water qualities and migrate toward the corner, where they exit. Detail of the mixing chamber - Closeup on the migrating glasseels. Visible through the transparent skin are the gills and the heart It is the opinion of many scientists that eels have developed the finest nose on the planet. They can sense concentrations of one part in 19 trillion. This is the same concentration as one glass of alcohol in the waters of all America's Great Lakes. For the eels the sensory impressions are probably as diverse as the colors visible for us. The system is submerged, and a digital camera observes the exits. The dynIMAGE software monitors the frequency of decisions per exit. Many thousand of glasseels pass through the system on a single day. The three exits in the left lower corner carry water from polluted sources (one is a drinking water reservoir). EcoSCOPE systems have already been tracking water pollution and its effect on fish and plankton behavior in Europe and the United States). For the future it is anticipated to deploy ecoSCOPEs continuously online, within the project LEO Projekt off New York City, visible for the public. Tests have also been performed with different qualities of drinking water and with solutions of runoff juice from different samples of fish.

He first appeared in the 1951 short \\"Fathers Are People\\" as Goofy Jr., and later appeared in the 1992 television series Goof Troop as Max Goof, a preteen. He then later appeared as a teenager in the spin-off film A Goofy Movie (1995), its direct-to-video sequel An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000), and in the 2001 TV series House of Mouse as a parking valet. He appeared as a child in the direct-to-video film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (1999) and as a young adult in its sequel Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (2004). He makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 DuckTales reboot episode \\"Quack Pack!\\". Max has also appeared as a playable character in video games such as Goof Troop (1993) for the Super NES, Disney Golf (2002) for the PlayStation 2, and Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding (2001) for PC CD. Origins The first appearance of Goofy's son was in the 1951 theatrical short Fathers Are People. He is referred to as Goofy Junior or simply Junior. He later appeared in a few other shorts such as Father's Lion (1952), Father's Day Off (in which Goofy refers to his son as \\"George\\" at one point), Father's Weekend (1953), and Aquamania (1961). In these earlier films, Goofy was also portrayed with a wife, though nameless and with her face always hidden from view. When Goof Troop was created, Goofy Junior evolved into Max, and Goofy's wife was no longer on the scene. Disney Guest Services FAQ later stated there is no definitive answer regarding details of his mother, as one has not been revealed \\"on the screen\\". Overview Theme park incarnation of Max Max is one of the few Disney characters, aside from his best friend PJ and Huey, Dewey, and Louie, child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He is depicted as an 11¬Ω-year-old in Goof Troop, then a teenager in high school in A Goofy Movie,In The Making of A Goofy Movie, director Kevin Lima describes Max as being 14 years old. and then in An Extremely Goofy Movie he is a high school graduate starting college. In House of Mouse, he is still a teenager but one who is old enough to be employed as a parking valet. In Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, he is a child who looks and sounds younger than he does in Goof Troop. In Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, he is a young adult who is returning home for the holidays. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy (although that is a trait he does not display obviously in An Extremely Goofy Movie during the College X-Games competition). He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his old man, as he can be somewhat of a show- off at times when he excels at anything. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max, at one time reprimanding him to take personal responsibility by telling him about his (Max's) great-uncle, Eliot Goof, an FBI agent with a never-give-up attitude (and a parody of Eliot Ness). In the Goof Troop show, there are times he would get suckered in by Pete and his get-rich-quick schemes, only to come around towards the end. It seems, personality wise, that PJ is more like Goofy at times, while Max seems more like Pete. Despite everything, Max loves his father, even if he does wish that Goofy would be a little more normal. In the Goof Troop television series, Max is voiced by Dana Hill, while Shaun Fleming voices the younger Max in Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. Jason Marsden voices an older Max in all other appearances starting with A Goofy Movie. The Goof Troop series shows some of his relatives ‚Äì an older cousin named Debbie was featured in the episode \\"Leader of the Pack\\". In the Halloween episode \\"Hallow-Weenies\\" his father's \\"great-great-granddaddy\\" was Gooferamus T. Goofy, while a \\"Gooferamus G. Goof\\" is instead referred in \\"Calling All Goofs\\" as Max's \\"great-great-great- grandpappy\\";The Goof Troop episode \\"Hallow-Weenies\\" features a \\"Gooferamus T. Goofy\\", while the episode \\"Calling All Goofs\\" instead has Max refer to a \\"Gooferamus G. Goof\\". It is entirely possible that these are two separate men and are thus listed here as such, even if their names are admittedly quite similar and both are said to be Goofy's \\"great-great-granddaddy\\"/Max's \\"great- great-great-grandpappy\\". at a family reunion in \\"Calling All Goofs\\" his relatives are Goofy's Aunt Goophelia, Pattonleather Goof (Goofy's great-uncle and a parody of General George S. Patton), Wernher von Goof (Goofy's scientist cousin and a parody of Wernher von Braun), and M. Angelo Goof (Goofy's artist uncle and a parody of Michelangelo). In \\"the Old Country\\" his father's \\"great- grand uncle\\"Goofy identified Dr. Frankengoof as his \\"great grand-uncle\\", an alternate description for a \\"great-great-uncle\\", thereby making Dr. Frankengoof Max's \\"great-great-great-uncle\\". was the late mad scientist Dr. Frankengoof. Other relatives include Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees A.K.A. \\"Goofin' Hood\\" (Max's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- granddad, and a parody of Robin Hood), Sherlock Goof (Max's great-great-great uncle and a parody of Sherlock Holmes), Mopalong Goofy (Max's great-great- great-grandpa and a parody of Hopalong Cassidy), and Caveman Goof (Max's and Goofy's prehistoric ancestor) In one episode of Goof Troop, Goofy says that Max was scared of the witch in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs when he was younger. Over the course of his life, Max's has been romantically involved with at least two young ladies. In A Goofy Movie, Max tries to impress a popular girl at his school named Roxanne, and ends up with her by the film's end, but by the second movie, Max is apparently single again as he flirts with a number of other girls at the college. However, in an episode of House of Mouse, he and Roxanne are a couple once more, on a date at the titular House of Mouse. Later, in Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, Max is seen with yet another a girl named Mona, whom he brings home for Christmas to meet his father and attempts to impress her while trying not to be embarrassed by his father's goofiness. Both Roxanne and Mona are voiced by Kellie Martin, except in the House of Mouse episode in which Roxanne is instead voiced by Grey DeLisle. Max has a love for skateboarding, as shown in the Goof Troop episodes \\"Leader of the Pack\\" and \\"Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp\\" and the films A Goofy Movie and An Extremely Goofy Movie. Appearances =Goof Troop= In the series Goof Troop, Max is 11¬Ω years old, active, nice, observant, friendly, and best friends with P.J., Pete's son. He and P.J. are in the same grade at their junior high school. Contains a scene showing the front of the school with a sign over the entrance which says \\"Spoonerville Jr. High\\". Contains a scene showing the front of the school with a sign over the entrance which says \\"Spoonerville Jr. High\\", as well as a scene showing the school newspaper with the heading \\"Spoonerville Jr. High\\", and a scene showing one of the school's peripheral buildings with the label \\"Spoonerville Jr. High School\\" printed on its wall. He loves his father, and is close to him, but wishes he would be a bit more normal. He wears baggy jeans, white gloves, multicolored sneakers, and a red shirt. =A Goofy Movie= A Goofy Movie features Max as a teenage high school student, finishing the school year before going on summer vacation. In this movie, Max has grown to find his father's goofy antics embarrassing, and is likewise viewed by his peers as a geek and a goof himself; a view he seeks to change at the school assembly when he dresses up like the musician rock star Powerline and interrupts the principal's speech to dance and perform to Powerline's hit song \\"Stand Out\\" before the entire student body. Additionally, Max seeks to gain the attention of his crush, a popular girl named Roxanne, whom Max is convinced only ever '[looks] right through [him]' and believes the laugh he inherited from his father (\\"ah- hyuck\\") is to her disliking. Though Max ends up in detention for hijacking the assembly, he succeeds in not only impressing the other students but also winning the affections of Roxanne, who shyly yet delightedly agrees to go with him to a party that is to be held the next Saturday. However, the principal informs Max's father, Goofy, about Max's bad behavior. Fearful that his son is becoming a delinquent, Goofy decides to take Max on a cross-country fishing trip for some 'father-son bonding', much to Max's chagrin. Before Goofy and Max hit the road, Max pays a quick visit to Roxanne's house to explain to her why he can no longer go with her to the party, but ends up lying to her that it's because he's instead going to see Powerline live in concert in Los Angeles, and that he and his father will join Powerline on stage for the last song since, as Max claims, Goofy and Powerline are old acquaintance. The guilt from this lie eats at Max throughout the film, while Goofy tries to bond with his son in ways that end up pushing Max away even further. When Goofy appoints Max the official navigator of their road trip, things go much more smoothly for the two as Max gets to pick all the stops along the way. But, unbeknownst to Goofy, Max had secretly changed the driving route on the map to lead them to Los Angeles, and when Goofy finds out, he and Max come to a head as the two finally let out all their held-back emotions at each other before they finally reach an understanding in which Max confesses to his dad how he's felt about Roxanne and the lie he told her before. By this point, Max and Goofy admit that they are stuck together and wouldn't want to be with anyone else in this situation. The two actually make it to the Powerline concert, even appearing (accidentally) onstage. By the end of the film, when the two arrive back home, Max reveals to Roxanne that he lied, admitting that he just wanted her to like him. Roxanne in turn confesses that she already did like Max, revealing that the goofy laugh Max had been so embarrassed by was the very thing that led to her liking him. After Goofy's car suddenly explodes due to the damage after it fallen at the waterfall, he is sent crashing through the roof of Roxanne's porch, at which point Max introduces Roxanne to his dad. =An Extremely Goofy Movie= In the direct-to-video sequel to A Goofy Movie, An Extremely Goofy Movie, Max is a high school graduate and leaves for college with his best friends P.J. and Bobby Zimuruski. He hopes to start a new life for himself and partake in the College X-Games competition. Upon his arrival to the campus, he and his friends are met by the five-time X-Games champions, the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity. However, because the Gammas invited only Max and not P.J. and Bobby to join them, Max makes a bet against the Gammas' leader, Bradley Uppercrust III, to see who will be towel boy to the other should either win the X-Games. Meanwhile, Goofy gets fired from his job (for an accident caused by his empty nest syndrome) and must go back to college to get a degree, as it's the only way for him to get a new job. He attends the same college as his son, much to Max's dismay as he'd hoped to finally get away from his father's overbearing doting. Eventually, Max manages to distract his father by introducing him to Ms. Sylvia Marpole, the college's librarian, who takes a romantic interest in Goofy and vice versa while Max sneaks off to practice his skateboarding. When Goofy gets a date with Sylvia, he rushes off to tell Max only to interfere with Max's practice, resulting in the onlooking Bradley to misinterpret Goofy's clumsy antics on Max's skateboard for skill and offers Goofy membership to the Gammas. Max encourages his father to join, viewing it as another distraction to keep Goofy further away from his X-Games practices. When Goofy inadvertently beats Max at the qualifying rounds for the College X-Games (thanks in part to some sneaky cheating by Bradley), Max ends up blowing up at his father, revealing his desires to get away from his father and estranges him completely by telling him to \\"leave him alone and get his own life\\", sending Goofy into depression. When Goofy later overhears the Gammas' plan to cheat in the games, Goofy tries to warn his son, who doesn't believe him, as he still wants him out of his life. But once it becomes clear to Max (during the X-Games' final round) that the Gammas really have been cheating all along, Max realizes that Goofy was telling the truth and, feeling remorseful for disowning him and not listening to his warnings, manages to ask his dad to fill in for the incapacitated P.J., which Goofy happily accepts. During the final stretch of the triathlon, Bradley activates a rocket hidden in Max's skateboard, causing an explosion that ends up trapping fellow Gamma member Tank underneath some fallen fiery debris. Max forgoes heading straight to the finish line to first rescue Tank (with help from Goofy) and ultimately manages to just barely beat Bradley to the finish line. In the end, both father and son make amends at Goofy's graduation and Max gives his father the X-Games championship trophy as an apology gift for his unkind and selfish disownment while Goofy finally sees that Max no longer needs a guardian as the two part ways, with Goofy (now cured of his empty nest syndrome) heading to another date with Sylvia, and finally leaving Max to at last live his own life at college. =Disney's House of Mouse= In the House of Mouse TV series, Max is still a teenager (although considerably older than in A Goofy Movie) and works as the parking valet for the club, and appears to be most level-headed and calm of all the club's employees. However, this may be because his duties are not nearly as important as some of the others, and his inclusions are just to help out the rest of the cast. However, in episodes that revolve around him or Goofy, his insecurities and personal flaws are much more noticeable and intentional. In the episode \\"Max's Embarrassing Date\\", Max is off work and on a date with Roxanne at the House of Mouse. While all the main Disney cast (Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy) attempted to keep Goofy away from the two so as to not embarrass Max in front of Roxanne, they ended up embarrassing him themselves until Goofy finally cuts in to give Max and Roxanne some privacy for the night. Max makes a cameo appearance in Mickey's House of Villains when the villains are entering the House of Mouse. =Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas and Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas= In the direct-to-video traditionally animated film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, in the segment \\"A Very Goofy Christmas\\", Max goes bicycling into the mall with his father, Goofy, to catch up to the mail truck in order to mail his letter to Santa. However, when their neighbor Pete tells Max that there is no such thing as Santa, Goofy goes out of his way to try to prove to Max that Santa does exist. However, after staying up all night with no luck, Goofy is filled with disappointment, leaving it to Max to cheer his father. In the end, Santa finally arrives to the joyful awe and wonderment of Goofy and Max. In this film, Max is a little boy, placing \\"A Very Goofy Christmas\\" chronologically before all other titles Max appears in. The direct-to-video computer animated film Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (a sequel to Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas) is currently Max's latest appearance in any Disney media produced. In the segment titled \\"Christmas Maximus\\", Max has grown up into a young adult. He brings his lady friend Mona (whom Max hopes to make his girlfriend) home for Christmas to meet his father. Goofy picks them up at the train station and brings them back to the house, where Goofy shows Mona Max's baby pictures and unwittingly embarrasses Max with all his fatherly love. In the end, as Mona finds Goofy's quirks to be endearing, Max decides to forget his embarrassment and join in the fun. Max later appears (in a non-speaking role) with his father and the other characters in the last segment of the film, \\"Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas\\", in which they drive around the city in a snowplow to look for Pluto, who had previously run away after his having angering Mickey. After Pluto returns, everyone (Max included) pulls up to Mickey's house in the snowplow, exits the snowplow, and goes inside the house to celebrate Christmas. Max and everyone applaud Mickey and Pluto topping the Christmas tree with the star decoration, and then they all join in singing a short medley of \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" and \\"Deck the Halls\\" to close out the special. During the end credits sequence, a pop-up book version of Max and Mona are seen sliding close to each other (presumably to share a kiss) before a pop-up version of Goofy covers them both from view with a picture frame containing credits specific to the \\"Christmas Maximus\\" segment. Later, the closing image of Goofy and Max holding a Christmas caroling book together from the end of \\"Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas\\" is shown again towards the end of the credits, as the last time Max was seen in Disney animation for the next sixteen years. =DuckTales= In the 2017 DuckTales series, Goofy refers to \\"Maxie\\" by name in the episode \\"Quack Pack!\\", when the former shows pictures of him and Max in his wallet, with one showing Max and P.J. and another with Max and Roxanne. Disney Parks At the Walt Disney World Resort, Max is a meetable character, and is featured during the \\"Move It! Shake It! Mousekedance It!\\" parade. He and Goofy were also part of the \\"Mickeys Magical TV World\\" show in the Magic Kingdom. At Tokyo Disneyland, Max occasionally appears with Goofy on floats in seasonal parades. He can also be found sometimes as a meetable character at the front of the park. Voice actors Bobby Driscoll voiced Goofy Junior From 1951 Fathers Are People to 1952 Father‚Äôs Lion. In 1992 when Goof Troop was created Goofy Junior evolved to Max Goof as a preteen Max was voiced by Dana Hill Hill once said in a interview with Disney Adventures issue about playing Max is his laugh which Hill had to come up with a laugh that had a Younger Goofy quality to it. ‚ÄúI wanted to get the impishness of Woody Woodpecker with a lower dog-like quality‚Äù. Hill used her natural voice to perform the character which her voice sometimes crack which she just sound like herself doing Max, Hill would continued to voice Max for commercials, Promos, TV Specials, Disney Projects, Disney Parks and other miscellaneous material with the exception of A Goofy Movie until her Death in 1996. In 1995 Max Goof became a Teenager in A Goofy Movie where he is voiced by Jason Marsden which became his first animated film that he worked on at the age of 18, Marsden continued to voice Max in An Extremely Goofy Movie, House of Mouse, Mickey‚Äôs Twice Upon a Christmas and other Disney projects.

The term jaws is also broadly applied to the whole of the structures constituting the vault of the mouth and serving to open and close it and is part of the body plan of humans and most animals. Arthropods The mandibles of a bull ant In arthropods, the jaws are chitinous and oppose laterally, and may consist of mandibles or chelicerae. These jaws are often composed of numerous mouthparts. Their function is fundamentally for food acquisition, conveyance to the mouth, and/or initial processing (mastication or chewing). Many mouthparts and associate structures (such as pedipalps) are modified legs. Vertebrates In most vertebrates, the jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically, comprising an upper jaw and a lower jaw. The vertebrate jaw is derived from the most anterior two pharyngeal arches supporting the gills, and usually bears numerous teeth. Jaws of a 250px =Fish= thumb The vertebrate jaw probably originally evolved in the Silurian period and appeared in the Placoderm fish which further diversified in the Devonian. The two most anterior pharyngeal arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, respectively. The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull, permitting great mobility of the jaws. While there is no fossil evidence directly to support this theory, it makes sense in light of the numbers of pharyngeal arches that are visible in extant jawed vertebrates (the Gnathostomes), which have seven arches, and primitive jawless vertebrates (the Agnatha), which have nine. The original selective advantage offered by the jaw may not be related to feeding, but rather to increased respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the buccal pump (observable in modern fish and amphibians) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans), in feeding, was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates. Many teleost fish have substantially modified jaws for suction feeding and jaw protrusion, resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved. =Amphibians, reptiles, and birds= The jaw in tetrapods is substantially simplified compared to fish. Most of the upper jaw bones (premaxilla, maxilla, jugal, quadratojugal, and quadrate) have been fused to the braincase, while the lower jaw bones (dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, and articular) have been fused together into a unit called the mandible. The jaw articulates via a hinge joint between the quadrate and articular. The jaws of tetrapods exhibit varying degrees of mobility between jaw bones. Some species have jaw bones completely fused, while others may have joints allowing for mobility of the dentary, quadrate, or maxilla. The snake skull shows the greatest degree of cranial kinesis, which allows the snake to swallow large prey items. =Mammals= In mammals the jaws are made up of the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw). In the ape there is a reinforcement to the lower jaw bone called the simian shelf. In the evolution of the mammalian jaw, two of the bones of the jaw structure (the articular bone of the lower jaw, and quadrate) were reduced in size and incorporated into the ear, while many others have been fused together. As a result, mammals show little or no cranial kinesis, and the mandible is attached to the temporal bone by the temporomandibular joints. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is a common disorder of these joints, characterized by pain, clicking and limitation of mandibular movement. Sea urchins Sea urchins possess unique jaws which display five-part symmetry, termed the Aristotle's lantern. Each unit of the jaw holds a single, perpetually growing tooth composed of crystalline calcium carbonate.

Hydraulic rescue tools are used by emergency rescue personnel to assist vehicle extrication of crash victims, as well as other rescues from small spaces. These tools include cutters, spreaders, and rams. Such devices were first used in 1963 as a tool to free race car drivers from their vehicles after crashes. History A hydraulic spreader in use, seen here widening a window on the door of a Volkswagen Golf Mk2 to allow fire crews access into the vehicle. The Hurst Rescue Tool was invented by George Hurst, circa 1961, after he viewed a stock car race accident in which it took workers over an hour to remove an injured driver from his car. Previously rescuers often used circular saws for vehicle extrication, but these suffered from several drawbacks. Saws can create sparks, which could start a fire, create loud sounds, stress the victim(s), and often cut slowly. Alternatively, rescuers could try to pry open the vehicle doors with a crowbar or Halligan bar, but this could compromise the stability of the vehicle, injure the victims further, or inadvertently trigger the airbags of the vehicle. In comparison, hydraulic spreader-cutters are quieter, faster, stronger, and more versatile: they can cut, open, and even lift a vehicle. Hurst Performance began to export parts to a European company, Zumro ResQtec, to avoid import duty. Zumro ResQtec was interested in developing these tools for use in auto racing, with ResQtec targeting the European market and Hurst targeting the American market. The hydraulic spreader was originally developed in 1972 by Tim Smith and Mike Brick, who later developed a cutter and a hydraulic ram. When an occupant is trapped the tool is used to pry or cut the car to remove the occupant. It takes about two minutes to take the roof off a car. 'Mike Brick' coined the phrase \\"Jaws of Life\\" after he observed people saying that their new device \\"snatched people from the jaws of death\\", then used as a registered brand name for Hurst products. Brick later developed a single rescue tool that combines the functions (push, pull, cut and spread) of previous rescue tools, and patented it; the design is currently implemented as the Phoenix Rescue tool. Tool types =Shears= The cutter is a pair of hydraulically powered shears that is designed to cut through metal. It is often called the jaws of life, owing to the shape and configuration of its blades. Sometimes specified as to their capacity to cut a solid circular steel bar, these are most commonly used to cut through a vehicle's structure in an extraction operation. Cutter blades are replaceable, and blade development progresses as vehicle technology progresses in order to be able to cope with the new car protection technology. =Spreader= A spreader is a hydraulic tool that is designed with two arms that come together in a narrow tip, and that uses hydraulic pressure to separate or spread the arms. The tip of the tool can be inserted into a narrow gap between two vehicle panels (such as between two doors, or between a door and a fender)‚Äîwhen the tool is operated. Spreaders may also be used to \\"pop\\" vehicle doors from their hinges. =Combination spreader= While a cutter or spreader tool is designed for a particular application, a combination tool, or combi-tool as popularly referred to by the fire department, is also available, which combines the cutting and spreading functions of separate tools into a single tool. In operation, the tips of the spreader-cutter's blades are wedged into a seam or gap‚Äîfor example, around a vehicle door‚Äîand the device engaged. The hydraulic pump, attached to the tool or as a separate unit, powers a piston that pushes the blades apart with great force and spreads the seam. Once the seam has been spread, the now-open blades can be repositioned around the metal. The device is engaged in reverse and the blades close, cutting through metal. Repeating this process allows a rescuer to quickly open a gap wide enough to pull free a trapped victim. The blades can spread or cut with a force of several tons or kilo-newtons with the tips of the blades spreading up to a meter. This operation can also be performed by dedicated spreading and cutting tools, which are designed especially for their own operations and may be required for some rescues. Spreader-cutters sometimes have lower capabilities when compared to the dedicated tool (e.g. a smaller spreading range) but may be useful where space is at a premium on fire and rescue vehicles, or when the budget does not allow for a separate cutter and spreader tool. Many manufacturers utilize the body of their dedicated cutting tool for the combination tool. Specially engineered combination blades that are designed to spread and cut are used on the cutter body. If the end user decides later to add a separate cutter and spreader, the blades of the combination tool can be changed to make it a cutter only. =Extension rams= A demonstration of using a hydraulic ram to open up the space at the passenger leg area Rams are used far less than spreader-cutters in auto rescues; nonetheless, they serve an important purpose. There are many types and sizes, including single-piston, dual-piston and telescopic rams. Sizes commonly vary from 50.80 cm (20\\") to 178 cm (70\\") (extended). Rams use more hydraulic fluid during operation than spreader-cutters, so it is essential that the pump being used has enough capacity to allow the ram to reach full extension. Power The tools operate on the basis of the hydraulic fluid pressure of up to 720 bar (10,000 psi), which must be provided from a power source. At present, there are three different means of generating pressure. The most commonly used source is a separate power unit, small petrol (gasoline) engine connected to a hydraulic pump. The hydraulic fluid is pressurised in the pump and conveyed in a hose under pressure to the tool. Alternative power sources are a small electrical pump in the tool powered by a heavy-duty rechargeable battery, and a hand- or foot-operated pump also connected to the tool directly. These are useful for lighter-duty use and do not require the storage space taken up by the separate power unit and associated lengths of hose. Some manufacturers have begun offering all-electric products driving rotation motors or a screw piston. These are still relatively new on the market and thus may still be somewhat immature but potentially offer many benefits over hydraulic such as but not limited to lower cost of ownership, quicker, more direct and responsive operation, decreased weight and improved portability and handling, and greater reliability.

Early life Born at Maidstone in Kent, Richard Woodville was the son of Richard Wydeville (Woodville), chamberlain to the Duke of Bedford, and Joan Bittlesgate (or Bedlisgate), the daughter of Thomas Bittlesgate of Knightstone\\"Knighteston\\" in the hundred of Ottery St Mary: Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John- William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.148; Modern \\"Knightstone\\", per Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, pp.528-9\\"Woodville Family\\", http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/WOODVILLE.htm.

Marriage and courtly career Arms of Woodville: Argent, a fesse and a canton conjoined gules Woodville followed his father into service with the Duke of Bedford. In 1433 the Duke had married the 17-year-old Jacquetta of Luxembourg; she was the Duke's second wife and he was significantly older and in ill health. When the Duke died in 1435, Jacquetta was left a childless and wealthy widow. She was required to seek permission from King Henry VI before she could remarry, but in March 1437 it was revealed that she had secretly married Richard Woodville who was far below her in rank and not considered a suitable husband for the lady still honoured as the king's aunt. The couple were fined ¬£1000, but this was remitted in October of the same year. Despite this inauspicious start, the married couple soon prospered, thanks mainly to Jacquetta's continuing prominence within the royal family. She retained her rank and dower as Duchess of Bedford, which initially provided an income of between ¬£7000 and ¬£8000 per year, though over the years this diminished as a result of territorial losses in France and collapsing royal finances in England. Richard Woodville was honoured with military ranks, in which he proved himself a capable soldier. Further honours for both came when Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, whose uncle was Jacquetta's brother-in-law (Jacquetta's sister Isabelle married Margaret of Anjou's paternal uncle Charles du Maine). The Woodvilles were among those chosen to escort the bride to England, and the family benefited further through this double connection to the royal family. Sir Richard was raised to the rank of Baron Rivers in 1448. Their children therefore would grow up enjoying considerable privilege and material comfort. Military career Woodville was a captain in 1429, served in France in 1433 and was a knight of the regent Duke of Bedford in 1435. He was at Gerberoy in 1435 and served under William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, in 1435‚Äì36. He then fought under Somerset and Shrewsbury in 1439 and the Duke of York in 1441‚Äì42, when he was made captain of Alen√ßon and knight banneret. He was appointed seneschal of Gascony in 1450 (but failed to reach it before its fall), lieutenant of Calais in 1454‚Äì55, and to defend Kent against invasion by the Yorkist earls in 1459‚Äì60 (but was captured at Sandwich). He was created Baron Rivers by Henry VI on 9 May 1448. Two years later, as Sir Richard, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1450. He was appointed Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1459. In the Wars of the Roses, he was initially a Lancastrian, but he became a Yorkist when he thought that the Lancastrian cause was lost. He reconciled himself to the victorious Edward IV, his future son-in-law. On 1 May 1464, Edward married his daughter Elizabeth, widow of Sir John Grey of Groby. Richard was created Earl Rivers in 1466, appointed Lord Treasurer in March 1466 and Constable of England on 24 August 1467. Later career The power of this new family was very distasteful to the old baronial party, and especially so to the Earl of Warwick. Rivers was regarded as a social upstart, and in an ironical episode, his future son-in-law in 1460, while accepting his submission, had rebuked him for daring, given his lowly birth, to fight against the House of York. The Privy Council, in its horrified response to the King's marriage, said bluntly that Richard Woodville's low social standing in itself meant that the King must surely know \\"that Elizabeth was not the wife for him\\". Early in 1468, the Rivers estates were plundered by Warwick's partisans, and the open war of the following year was aimed at destroying the Woodvilles. After the Yorkist defeat at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469, Rivers and his second son John were taken prisoners at Chepstow. Following a hasty show trial, they were beheaded at Kenilworth on 12 August 1469. Richard Woodville's eldest son Anthony succeeded him in the earldom. Lord Rivers had a large family. His third son, Lionel (d. 1484) became the Bishop of Salisbury. All his daughters made great marriages: Catherine Woodville, his eighth daughter, was the wife of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. \\"Woodville\\" is the modern spelling of the name: in their own time \\"Wydeville\\", \\"Wydville\\" and other variants were used.

He held MA and PhD degrees in clinical psychology from Columbia University and the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP). He also founded and was the President of the New York City-based Albert Ellis Institute for decades.Albert Ellis Institute He is generally considered to be one of the originators of the cognitive revolutionary paradigm shift in psychotherapy and an early proponent of cognitive-behavioral therapies. Based on a 1982 professional survey of US and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the second most influential psychotherapist in history (Carl Rogers ranked first in the survey; Sigmund Freud was ranked third).New York Times: Despite Illness and Lawsuits, a Famed Psychotherapist Is Temporarily Back in Session December 16, 2006 Psychology Today noted, \\"No individual‚Äînot even Freud himself‚Äîhas had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.\\"Epstein, R. (2001). \\"The Prince of Reason\\". Psychology Today. Early life Ellis was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in The Bronx borough of New York City from a young age. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, while his maternal grandfather originated from Galicia, Poland in Austria-Hungary. He was the eldest of three children. Ellis' father, Harry, was a broker, often away from home on business trips, who reportedly showed only a modicum of affection to his children. By his teenage years, his parents divorced, and he lived solely with his mother. In his autobiography, Ellis characterized his mother, Hattie, as a self- absorbed woman with a bipolar disorder. At times, according to Ellis, she was a \\"bustling chatterbox who never listened.\\" She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects, but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis' mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was often sleeping when he left for school and usually not home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased an alarm clock with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister. When the Great Depression struck, all three children sought work to assist the family. Ellis was sickly as a child and suffered numerous health problems throughout his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a kidney disease.New York Times: Albert Ellis, Influential Psychotherapist, Dies at 93 He was also hospitalized with tonsillitis, which led to a severe streptococcal infection requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven, one of which lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had \\"developed a growing indifference to that dereliction\\". Illness was to follow Ellis throughout his life; at age 40 he developed diabetes.psychotherapy.net: An Interview with Albert Ellis, PhD Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy Ellis had exaggerated fears of speaking in public and during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, he forced himself to talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens over a period of a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women. Education and early career Ellis entered the field of clinical psychology after first earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from what was then known as the City College of New York Downtown in 1934.http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/magazine/documents/Baruch-Winter07.pdf He began a brief career in business, followed by one as a writer. These endeavors took place during the Great Depression that began in 1929, and Ellis found that business was poor and had no success in publishing his fiction. Finding that he could write non-fiction well, Ellis researched and wrote on human sexuality. His lay counseling in this subject convinced him to seek a new career in clinical psychology. In 1942, Ellis began his studies for a PhD in clinical psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University, which trained psychologists mostly in psychoanalysis. He completed his Master of Arts in clinical psychology from Teachers College in June 1943, and started a part- time private practice while still working on his PhD degree‚Äîpossibly because there was no licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his PhD; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely used pencil-and-paper personality tests. He concluded that only the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory met the standards of a research-based instrument. In 1947, he was awarded a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, and at that time Ellis had come to believe that psychoanalysis was the deepest and most effective form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of Sigmund Freud. He sought additional training in psychoanalysis and then began to practice classical psychoanalysis. Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with Richard Hulbeck, a leading analyst at the Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been Hermann Rorschach, the developer of the Rorschach inkblot test). At that time he taught at New York University, Rutgers University, and Pittsburg State University and held a couple of leading staff positions. At this time, Ellis' faith in psychoanalysis was gradually crumbling. Early theoretical contributions to psychotherapy The writings of Karen Horney, Alfred Adler, Erich Fromm and Harry Stack Sullivan would be some of the influences in Ellis's thinking and played a role in shaping his psychological models.

Institute of General Semantics his book, Science and Sanity,Korzybski A. (1933). Science and Sanity. Institute of General Semantics, 1994, and general semantics for starting him on the philosophical path for founding rational therapy. In addition, modern and ancient philosophy (particularly stoicism), and his own experiences heavily influenced his new theoretical developments to psychotherapy.Albert Ellis institute: A Sketch of Albert Ellis Ellis acknowledged that his therapy was \\"by no means entirely new\\", as in particular Paul Charles Dubois's \\"rational persuasion\\" had prefigured some of its main principles; Ellis stated he had read him some years after inventing his therapy, but had studied √âmile Cou√© since a young age. From the late 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand‚Äîand act on the understanding‚Äîthat his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through rational analysis and cognitive reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs. In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavioral therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published How to Live with a Neurotic, which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the zeitgeist within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was behaviorism, while in clinical psychology it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, Jung, Adler, and Perls. Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment with the possible exception of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print.Dr. Mike and Dr. Lidia Abrams: A Brief Biography of Dr. Albert Ellis 1913‚Äì2007 He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant up on stage and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive- behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client's personality, client's clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist's own preference). Despite the relative slow adoption of his approach in the beginning, Ellis founded his own institute. The Institute for Rational Living was founded as a non-profit organization in 1959. By 1968, it was chartered by the New York State Board of Regents as a training institute and psychological clinic. Work as sexologist and sex and love researcher By the 1960s, Ellis had come to be seen as one of the founders of the American sexual revolution. Especially in his earlier career, he was well known for his work as a sexologist and for his liberal humanistic, and in some camps controversialElis A. (2009) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me - It Can Work for You, 2009, opinions on human sexuality. He also worked with noted zoologist and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey and explored in a number of books and articles the topic of human sexuality and love. Sex and love relations were his professional interests even from the beginning of his career. Norman Haire, in his preface to Ellis' 1952 book Sex Beliefs and Customs, applauded the work of the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease while he ridiculed its rival, the National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, who argued that preventive measures such as condoms would encourage vice: Haire called them \\"the Society for the Prevention of the Prevention of Venereal Disease\\".Diana Wyndham. (2012) Foreword by the Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG. (Sydney: , p.395 In 1958, Ellis published his classic work Sex Without Guilt which came to be known for its advocacy of a liberal attitude towards sex. He contributed to Paul Krassner's magazine The Realist; among its articles, in 1964 he wrote if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?Albert Ellis, Ph.D. (1964) if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?, in The Realist No.47 pp.17-8, 23 In 1965, Ellis published a book entitled Homosexuality: Its Causes and Cure, which partly saw homosexuality as a pathology and therefore a condition to be cured. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reversed its position on homosexuality by declaring that it was not a mental disorder and thus not properly subject to cure, and in 1976, Ellis clarified his earlier views in Sex and the Liberated Man, expounding that some homosexual disturbed behaviors may be subject to treatment but, in most cases, that should not be attempted as homosexuality is not inherently good or evil, except from a religious viewpoint (See \\"Ellis and religion\\", below). Near the end of his life, he finally updated and re-wrote Sex Without Guilt in 2001 and released as Sex Without Guilt in the Twenty- First Century. In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice. Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) Ellis published his first major book on Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) in 1962. REBT is an active-directive, philosophically and empirically based psychotherapy, the aim of which is to resolve emotional and behavioral problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.Ellis, A.

Ellis and religion In his original version of his book Sex Without Guilt, Ellis expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are often needless and harmful to emotional health. He also famously debated religious psychologists, including Orval Hobart Mowrer and Allen Bergin, over the proposition that religion often contributed to psychological distress. Because of his forthright espousal of a nontheistic humanism, he was recognized in 1971 as Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. By 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Ellis most recently described himself as a probabilistic atheist, meaning that while he acknowledged that he could not be completely certain there is no god, he believed the probability a god exists was so small that it was not worth his or anyone else's attention.Nielsen, Stevan Lars & Ellis, Albert. (1994). A discussion with Albert Ellis: Reason, emotion and religion, Journal of Psychology and Christianity, 13(4), Win 1994. pp. 327‚Äì341 While Ellis' personal atheism and humanism remained consistent, his views about the role of religion in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In \\"The Case Against Religiosity\\", a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists. Ellis was careful to state that REBT was independent of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy.Ellis A. (2000). Can rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) be effectively used with people who have devout beliefs in God and religion?. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 31(1), Feb 2000. pp. 29‚Äì33 Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view in one of his last books The Road to Tolerance, and he also co-authored a book, Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients. Political views Ellis was a lifelong advocate for peace and an opponent of militarism. He also praised libertarian economist Walter Block's book, Defending the Undefendable. Later life =Professional contributions= While many of his ideas were criticized during the 1950s and '60s by the psychotherapeutic establishment, his reputation grew immensely in the subsequent decades. From the 1960s on, his prominence was steadily growing as the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) were gaining further theoretical and scientific ground.Yankura J. & Dryden W. (1994). Albert Ellis. SAGE. From then, CBT gradually became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in many countries, mainly due to the large body of rigorously conducted research that underpinned the work of the cognitive therapy school (a key part of the CBT family) founded by Aaron T. Beck. In the late 1960s, his institute launched a professional journal, and in the early 70s established \\"The Living School\\" for children between 6 and 13. The school provided a curriculum that incorporated the principles of RE(B)T. Despite its relative short life, interest groups generally expressed satisfaction with its programmer. Many schools of psychological thought became influenced by Albert Ellis, including Rational Behavior Therapy created by a student of his, Maxie Clarence Maultsby Jr. Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 survey, American and Canadian clinical psychologists and counsellors ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the average influence on their field. Also in 1982, in an analysis of psychology journals published in the US it was found that Ellis was the most cited author after 1957. In 1985, the APA presented Dr. Ellis with its award for \\"distinguished professional contributions\\". He held many important positions in many professional societies including the Division of Consulting Psychology of the APA, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, American Association of Marital and Family Therapy, the American Academy of Psychotherapists and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counsellors, and Therapists. In addition Ellis also served as consulting or associate editor of many scientific journals. Many professional societies gave Ellis their highest professional and clinical awards. In the mid-1990s, he renamed his psychotherapy and behavior change system rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). (It was originally known as rational therapy and then rational-emotive therapy.) This he did to stress the interrelated importance of cognition, emotion and behaviour in his therapeutic approach. In 1994, he also updated and revised his original, 1962 classic book, Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy.Ellis A. Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy, Revised Edition, 1994, . During the remainder of his life, he continued developing the theory that cognition, emotion and behaviour are intertwined, and that a system for psychotherapy and behaviour change must involve all three. =Public appearance= Ellis's work extended into areas other than psychology, including education, politics, business and philosophy. He eventually became a prominent and confrontational social commenter and public speaker on a wide array of issues. During his career he publicly debated a vast number of people who represented opposing views to his; this included for example debates with psychologist Nathaniel Branden on Objectivism and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz on the topic of mental illness. On numerous occasions he critiqued opposing psychotherapeutic approaches, and questioned some of the doctrines in certain dogmatic religious systems, i.e.:spiritualism and mysticism. From 1965 until the end of his life he led his famous Friday Night Workshops, in which he conducted therapy sessions with volunteers from the audience. The 1970s found him introducing his popular \\"rational humorous songs\\" which combined humorous lyrics with a rational self-help message set to a popular tune. Ellis also held workshops and seminars on mental health and psychotherapy all over the world until his 90s. =Final years= Until he fell ill at the age of 92 in 2006, Ellis typically worked at least 16 hours a day, writing books in longhand on legal tablets, visiting with clients, and teaching. On his 90th birthday in 2003, he received congratulatory messages from well-known public figures such as then-President George W. Bush, New York senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the Dalai Lama, who sent a silk scarf blessed for the occasion.Recollection of Stevan Lars Nielsen, Ph.D. who was present at the 90th birthday partyThe New Yorker: The Human Condition ‚Äì Ageless, Guiltless In 2004, Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his large intestine. He returned to work after a few months of supportive care. In 2005, he was removed from all professional duties and from the board of his own institute after a dispute over the management policies of the institute.https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14947/ Ellis was reinstated to the board in January 2006 after winning civil proceedings against the board members who removed him.NY Courts: Ellis v Broder (2006 NY Slip Op 26023) On June 6, 2007, lawyers acting for Albert Ellis filed a suit against the Albert Ellis Institute in New York state court. The suit alleges a breach of a long-term contract with the AEI and sought recovery of the 45 East 65th Street property through the imposition of a constructive trust.William Knaus, Jon Geis, Ed Garcia. A Message in Support of Dr. Albert Ellis from Three Former Directors of Training of the Albert Ellis Institute Despite his series of health issues and profound hearing loss, Ellis never stopped working with the assistance of his wife, Australian psychologist Debbie Joffe Ellis. In April 2006, Ellis was hospitalized with pneumonia, and spent more than a year shuttling between hospital and a rehabilitation facility. He eventually returned to his residence on the top floor of the Albert Ellis Institute where he died on July 24, 2007 in his wife's arms. Ellis had authored and co- authored more than 80 books and 1200 articles (including eight hundred scientific papers) during his lifetime. He died aged 93. During his final years he worked on his only college textbook with longtime collaborator Mike Abrams with whom he co-authored 3 books along with several research articles and chapters, including the textbook Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives.Ellis, A. & Abrams, M. (2008) presented a completed Rational Emotive theory of personality. Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives. Thousand Oaks, Ca.:Sage Publications. Ellis' penultimate book was an autobiography entitled \\"All Out!\\" published by Prometheus Books in June 2010. The book was dedicated to and included contributions by his wife, Dr Debbie Joffe Ellis, to whom he entrusted the legacy of REBT. In early 2011, the book Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy by Albert and Debbie Joffe Ellis was released by the American Psychological Association. The book explains the essentials of the theory of REBT for students and practitioners of psychology as well as for the general public. In eulogy of Albert Ellis, APA past president Frank Farley states: > Psychology has had only of a handful of legendary figures who not only > command attention across much of the discipline but also receive high > recognition from the public for their work. Albert Ellis was such a figure, > known inside and outside of psychology for his astounding originality, his > provocative ideas, and his provocative personality. He bestrode the practice > of psychotherapy like a colossus‚Ä¶Farley, F. (2009). Albert Ellis > (1913‚Äì2007). American Psychologist, Vol 64(3), pp. 215‚Äì216 In the opening ceremony of the 2013 American Psychological Association Convention, Ellis was posthumously awarded the APA Award For Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology. It highlights the profound and historic role played in the life and evolution of the fields of psychology and psychotherapy.September 2013 edition of the American Psychological Association's \\"Monitor on Psychology\\" journal, Volume 44, No. 8, Page 10 Philosophical works The Road To Tolerance (Prometheus Books, 2004) explains the philosophies underlying REBT - particularly an attitude of tolerance - and relates it to many religious, philosophical and social movements. Prevention of unhappiness \\"I think I can honestly say that I am one of the relatively few people in the United States, and perhaps in the entire world, who has not had a seriously miserable day since I created REBT in 1955. I find it almost impossible to feel intensely depressed, hostile, or upset for more than literally a few minutes at a time. ... Whereas I was desperately unhappy for a good part of my childhood and teens, this feeling is virtually unknown to me today. Instead, these days I almost automatically go after self-disturbances and quickly eliminate them. Not squelch, suppress, or repress them ‚Äì I mean really eliminate. ... I derive considerable pleasure, enjoyment, and sometimes sheer bliss out of life. What more can one ask?\\" Albert Ellis, \\"The Road To Tolerance.\\" p. 77 \\"Final wisdom\\"; 'what works best for you' In the 'Final wisdom' chapter of his 2001 book, \\"Feeling better...\\", Ellis proposed that people try different tools to see what works best for them. \\"What works best for you may be radically different than what works for other people.\\"Feeling better, Getting better, Staying better, 2001, p235 Autobiographical works Most of the books Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his personal life to explain how the insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness.Ellis, A. (2003) Ask Albert Ellis. Atascadero, CA: Impact PublishersEllis, A. (1994) Reason and Emotion is Psychotherapy. New York, NY: Citadel PressEllis, A. (1998)Optimal Aging: Get Over Getting Older. Chicago, IL: Open Court Publishing Company He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked.Ellis, A. (1980) Growth Through Reason. Chatsworth CA: Wilshire Book Company Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. All Out!: An Autobiography (Prometheus Books, 2009) ‚Äîpublished after his death‚Äîis a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help). Criticism Fellow psychologists often criticized Ellis for what they described as a tone that could come off as blaming people for their depression, and for not offering any evidence to back his views on psychotherapy. In his obituary in the British newspaper The Guardian, it was noted that others, such as Aaron T. Beck, had conducted more rigorous testing than what Ellis was willing to undertake and were able to better advance cognitive therapy. His approach to treatment of severe depression was also criticized as suggesting simplistic things like \\"pull your socks up.\\" Ellis was often criticised for his language and his aggressive behaviour, such as in his debate with Ayn Rand.https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/archivingalbertellis/2011/03/23/rebt-vs- objectivism/ Published works * The Folklore of Sex, Oxford, England: Charles Boni, 1951. * The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach (introduction).

The identity of \\"Elise\\" is unknown; researchers have suggested Therese Malfatti, Elisabeth R√∂ckel, or Elise Barensfeld.  History  The score was not published until 1867, forty years after the composer's death in 1827. The discoverer of the piece, Ludwig Nohl, affirmed that the original autograph manuscript, now lost, had the title: \\"F√ºr Elise am 27 April [1810] zur Erinnerung von L. v. Bthvn\\" (\\"For Elise on April 27 in memory of L. v. Bthvn\\"). The music was published as part of Nohl's Neue Briefe Beethovens (New letters by Beethoven) on pages 28 to 33, printed in Stuttgart by Johann Friedrich Cotta. The version of \\"F√ºr Elise\\" heard today is an earlier version that was transcribed by Ludwig Nohl. There is a later version, with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a later manuscript by the Beethoven scholar Barry Cooper. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand arpeggios are delayed by a 16th note. There are a few extra bars in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece. The tempo marking Poco moto is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed (now lost). The later version includes the marking Molto grazioso. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece to a cycle of bagatelles.Ludwig van Beethoven, Klavierst√ºck a-Moll WoO 59 \\"F√ºr Elise\\". Kritische Ausgabe mit Faksimile der Handschrift BH 116, Skizzentranskription und Kommentar. Sieghard Brandenburg, Bonn 2002, pp. 8 and 15 Whatever the validity of Nohl's edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves the second right-hand note in bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody. Is it E4 or D4? Nohl's score gives E4 in bar 7, but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all of the figures to beginning with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. A point in favor of the D4 is that the ascending seventh of the motive in this form is repeated in sequence in bars 9 to 11 that begin the second section of the principal theme., 30-minute talk by Prof. Dr. Joachim Reinhuber The pianist and musicologist argued in his thesis and his 2010 book Beethoven al piano (new Italian edition: Beethoven al pianoforte, 2014) that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today. Chiantore suggested that the original signed manuscript, upon which Ludwig Nohl claimed to base his transcription, may never have existed.Luca Chiantore: Beethoven al piano. Barcelona: Nortesur, 2010, p. 333‚Äì360, On the other hand, Barry Cooper wrote, in a 1984 essay in The Musical Times, that one of two surviving sketches closely resembles the published version.  Identity of \\"Elise\\"  = Therese Malfatti = Therese Malfatti, widely believed to be the dedicatee of \\"F√ºr Elise\\" It is not certain who \\"Elise\\" was. Max Unger suggested that Ludwig Nohl may have transcribed the title incorrectly and the original work may have been named \\"F√ºr Therese\\",Max Unger, translated by Theodore Baker, \\"Beethoven and Therese von Malfatti,\\" The Musical Quarterly 11, no. 1 (1925): 63‚Äì72. a reference to Therese Malfatti von Rohrenbach zu Dezza (1792‚Äì1851). She was a friend and student of Beethoven's to whom he supposedly proposed in 1810, though she turned him down to marry the Austrian nobleman and state official Wilhelm von Dro√üdik in 1816.Michael Lorenz: \\"Baronin Dro√üdik und die verschneyten Nachtigallen. Biographische Anmerkungen zu einem Schubert- Dokument\\", Schubert durch die Brille 26, (Tutzing: Schneider, 2001), pp. 47‚Äì88. Note that the piano sonata no. 24, dedicated to Countess Th√©r√®se von Brunswick, is also referred to sometimes as \\"f√ºr Therese\\". The Austrian musicologist Michael LorenzMichael Lorenz: \\"'Die enttarnte Elise'. Die kurze Karriere der Elisabeth R√∂ckel als Beethovens 'Elise'\\" , Bonner Beethoven- Studien vol. 9, (Bonn 2011), 169‚Äì90. has shown that Rudolf Schachner, who in 1851 inherited Therese von Dro√üdik's musical scores, was the son of Babette Bredl, born out of wedlock. Babette in 1865 let Nohl copy the autograph in her possession. = Elisabeth R√∂ckel = Portrait of Elisabeth R√∂ckel by Joseph Willibrord M√§hler Anna Milder-Hauptmann, letter to \\"Frau Kapellmeisterin Elise Hummel\\", 1830 According to a 2010 study by Klaus Martin Kopitz, there is evidence that the piece was written for the 17-year-old German soprano singer Elisabeth R√∂ckel (1793‚Äì1883), the younger sister of Joseph August R√∂ckel, who played Florestan in the 1806 revival of Beethoven's opera Fidelio. \\"Elise\\", as she was called by a parish priest (later she called herself \\"Betty\\"), had been a friend of Beethoven's since 1808, who, according to Kopitz, perhaps wanted to marry her. But in April 1810 Elisabeth R√∂ckel got an engagement at the theater in Bamberg where she made her stage debut as Donna Anna in Mozart's Don Giovanni and became a friend of the writer E. T. A. Hoffmann. In 1811 R√∂ckel came back to Vienna, in 1813 she married there Beethoven's friend Johann Nepomuk Hummel. In 2015 Kopitz published further sources about Beethoven's relationship to R√∂ckel and the famous piano piece. It shows that she was also a close friend of Anna Milder-Hauptmann and lived together with her and her brother Joseph August in the Theater an der Wien. In a letter to R√∂ckel, which she wrote in 1830, she called her indeed \\"Elise\\". = Elise Barensfeld = In 2014, the Canadian musicologist Rita Steblin suggested that Elise Barensfeld might be the dedicatee. Born in Regensburg and treated for a while as a child prodigy, she first travelled on concert tours with Beethoven's friend Johann Nepomuk M√§lzel, also from Regensburg, and then lived with him for some time in Vienna, where she received singing lessons from Antonio Salieri. Steblin argues that Beethoven dedicated this work to the 13-year-old Elise Barensfeld as a favour to Therese Malfatti who lived opposite M√§lzel's and Barensfeld's residence and who might have given her piano lessons.\\"War M√§lzels S√§ngerin auch Beethovens 'Elise'?\\" by Juan Martin Koch, Neue Musikzeitung, 15 November 2012 Steblin admits that question marks remain for her hypothesis.\\"Geheimnis um Beethovens 'Elise' gel√ºftet?\\", Die Welt, 16 November 2012 ; Steblin, Rita: \\"Who was Beethoven's 'Elise'? A new solution to the mystery.\\" In: The Musical Times 155 (2014), pp. 3‚Äì39  Music  The piece can be heard as a five-part rondo, with the form A-B-A-C-A. It is in A minor and in time. It begins with the refrain A, a flowing melody in binary form marked Poco moto (literally \\"a little motion,\\" a tempo indication that does not appear elsewhere in Beethoven's works), with an arpeggiated left hand accompaniment. The unaccompanied oscillation between the dominant E and its chromatic lower neighbor D-sharp that begins the melody has become one of the most recognizable openings in classical music, but it also serves as a main topic of musical discussion. The digression at measure 9 glances at the relative major before returning to the original theme and key, preceded by a prolongation of the dominant, E that extends the opening lower-neighbor oscillation. The pitch outline of these bars, E-F-E-D-C-B, i.e. an upper- neighbor ascent to F5 followed by a descending scale, also forms the basis of the two episodes B and C, thus unifying the piece. The B section that begins in bar 23 is in the submediant, F major. Its theme begins by tracing the outline mentioned above in somewhat elaborated fashion and modulates to the dominant, followed by 32nd-note runs repeating a cadential progression in C major in a codetta-like passage. (The chordal three-note upbeats in the left hand have been anticipated by the transition to this episode in bar 22, a clever unifying touch.) This suggests a rather expansive form, but Beethoven suddenly returns to the dominant of A minor in bar 34, once again lingering on the dominant E and its lower neighbor and leading to an exact repeat of the A section. Although another nominal episode follows (C) at bar 59, it does not leave the tonic and is rather coda-like in feel, unfolding over a dramatic, throbbing tonic pedal in the bass and emphatically cadencing in the home key. Once again, there are unifying relationships with previously heard material. The melody retraces the descending outline alluded to earlier, and the cadence in bars 66-67 is an augmented version of the theme's cadence in bars 7-8. After a glance at a Neapolitan harmony (B-flat major) and a cadence at bar 76 that brings the music to a complete halt for the first and only time, an ascending A minor arpeggio and a chromatic descent over two octaves follows, sort of a cadenza in tempo, leading to a final repetition of the A section. The piece concludes without an added postlude. Kopitz presents the finding by the German organ scholar that the letters that spell Elise can be decoded as the first three notes of the piece. Because an E is called an Es in German and is pronounced as \\"S\\", that makes E‚Äì(L)‚Äì(I)‚ÄìS‚ÄìE: E‚Äì(L)‚Äì(I)‚ÄìE‚ÄìE, which by enharmonic equivalents sounds the same as the written notes E‚Äì(L)‚Äì(I)‚ÄìD‚ÄìE.

In the Reagan administration, he advocated \\"Reaganomics\\" and tax cuts as a means to create jobs and to stimulate production. Earlier in his life, he had studied at Harvard University before he served in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1946 he started to work for Merrill Lynch. He served as its chairman and CEO from 1971 to 1980. Early life Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of Kathleen (n√©e Ahearn) and William Francis Regan, he was of Irish Catholic origins. Regan earned his Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard College in 1940 and attended Harvard Law School before dropping out to join the Marine Corps at the outset of World War II. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel while he was serving in the Pacific Theater. He was involved in five major campaigns, including Guadalcanal and Okinawa. In 1942, Regan married the former Ann George Buchanan (1921‚Äì2006) with whom he had four children: Donna Regan Lefeve, Donald T. Regan, Jr., Richard William Regan, and Diane Regan Doniger. Wall Street Donald Regan portrait as Merrill Lynch CEO, by Robert Templeton, 1981 After the war, he joined Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. in 1946 as an account executive trainee. He worked up through the ranks, eventually taking over as Merrill Lynch's chairman and CEO in 1971, the year the company went public. He held those positions until 1980. Regan was one of the original directors of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and was vice chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 1973 to 1975. He was a major proponent of brokerage firms going public, which he viewed as an important step in the modernization of Wall Street. Under his supervision, Merrill Lynch had its initial public offering on June 23, 1971, becoming only the second Wall Street firm to go public. (Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was the first.) During his tenure in these two positions, Regan pushed hard for an end to minimum fixed commissions for brokers, which were fees that brokerage companies had to charge clients for every transaction they made on the clients' behalf. Regan saw them as a cartel-like restriction. His lobbying played a large part of fixed commissions being abolished in 1975. Reagan administration President Ronald Reagan selected Donald Regan in 1981 to serve as Treasury Secretary, marking him as a spokesman for his economic policies, dubbed \\"Reaganomics\\". He helped engineer changes in the tax code, reduce income tax rates, and decrease taxes for corporations. Regan unexpectedly swapped jobs with then White House Chief of Staff James Baker in 1985. As chief of staff, Regan was closely involved in the day-to-day management of White House policy, which led Howard Baker, Regan's successor as chief of staff, to give a rebuke that Regan was becoming a \\"prime minister\\" inside an increasingly-complex Imperial Presidency. During his four years as Secretary of the Treasury, Regan did not have a single one- to-one meeting with the president. Regan was forced to resign for repeatedly disagreeing with the First Lady and for being unable to contain the continuing political damage to President Reagan from the Iran‚ÄìContra affair.Fred I. Greenstein, \\"Ronald Reagan‚ÄîAnother Hidden-Hand Ike?.\\" PS: Political Science & Politics 23.1 (1990): 7-13. Regan's 1988 memoir, For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington, exposes his disagreements with First Lady Nancy Reagan, revealing publicly that she had a personal astrologer who was later revealed to be Joan Quigley with whom she consulted and who helped steer the president's decisions. Regan wrote: > Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during my time as > White House Chief of Staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San > Francisco [Quigley] who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets > were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.Donald Regan. For the > Record: From Wall Street to Washington, (San Diego: Harcourt Trade > Publishers, 1988), \\"The President's Astrologers\\", People (May 23, 1988) Donald Regan is portrayed by Frank Moore in the 2003 TV movie The Reagans. Sayings \\"And the horse you rode in on\\" was a favorite saying of Regan. He learned it from a poker buddy in Texas who said \\"fuck you and the horse you rode in on.\\" Regan adopted the latter part of the phrase. In the portrait of Regan that hangs on the third floor of the treasury, the title of a book in the background reads And the Horse You Rode In On. \\"You've got to give loyalty down if you want loyalty up.\\" \\"You're gonna have to speed it up\\", or simply \\"Speed it up\\", was a phrase that Regan infamously said to President Reagan during one of his speeches, effectively ordering him to hurry up, as shown in Michael Moore's documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story. Retirement Regan retired quietly in Virginia with Ann Regan, his wife of over 60 years. In late life, he spent nearly 10 hours a day in his art studio painting landscapes. He had four children and nine grandchildren. Death Regan died of cancer on June 10, 2003, at the age of 84, in a hospital near his home in Williamsburg, Virginia. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. References Further reading * Regan, Donald T. For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington (1988) * Johns, Andrew L. ed.

Early network interface controllers were commonly implemented on expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most newer computers have a network interface built into the motherboard. Modern network interface controllers offer advanced features such as interrupt and DMA interfaces to the host processors, support for multiple receive and transmit queues, partitioning into multiple logical interfaces, and on-controller network traffic processing such as the TCP offload engine.  Purpose  The network controller implements the electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer and data link layer standard such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. This provides a base for a full network protocol stack, allowing communication among computers on the same local area network (LAN) and large-scale network communications through routable protocols, such as Internet Protocol (IP). The NIC allows computers to communicate over a computer network, either by using cables or wirelessly. The NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device, as it provides physical access to a networking medium and, for IEEE 802 and similar networks, provides a low-level addressing system through the use of MAC addresses that are uniquely assigned to network interfaces.  Implementation  12 early ISA 8 bit and 16 bit PC network cards. The lower right-most card is an early wireless network card, and the central card with partial beige plastic cover is a PSTN modem. Network controllers were originally implemented as expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most new computers have a network interface controller built into the motherboard. Newer server motherboards may have multiple network interfaces built-in. The Ethernet capabilities are either integrated into the motherboard chipset or implemented via a low-cost dedicated Ethernet chip. A separate network card is typically no longer required unless additional independent network connections are needed or some non-Ethernet type of network is used. A general trend in computer hardware is towards integrating the various components of systems on a chip, and this is also applied to network interface cards. An Ethernet network controller typically has an 8P8C socket where the network cable is connected. Older NICs also supplied BNC, or AUI connections. Ethernet network controllers typically support 10 Mbit/s Ethernet, 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, and 1000 Mbit/s Ethernet varieties. Such controllers are designated as 10/100/1000, meaning that they can support data rates of 10, 100 or 1000 Mbit/s. 10 Gigabit Ethernet NICs are also available, and, , are beginning to be available on computer motherboards. A Qlogic QLE3442-CU SFP+ dual-port NIC Modular designs like SFP and SFP+ are highly popular, especially for fiber-optic communication. These define a standard receptacle for media-dependent transceivers, so users can easily adapt the network interface to their needs. LEDs adjacent to or integrated into the network connector inform the user of whether the network is connected, and when data activity occurs. The NIC may use one or more of the following techniques to indicate the availability of packets to transfer: * Polling is where the CPU examines the status of the peripheral under program control. * Interrupt-driven I/O is where the peripheral alerts the CPU that it is ready to transfer data. NICs may use one or more of the following techniques to transfer packet data: * Programmed input/output, where the CPU moves the data to or from the NIC to memory. * Direct memory access (DMA), where a device other than the CPU assumes control of the system bus to move data to or from the NIC to memory. This removes load from the CPU but requires more logic on the card. In addition, a packet buffer on the NIC may not be required and latency can be reduced.  Performance and advanced functionality  ATM network interface. Intel 82574L Gigabit Ethernet NIC, a PCI Express √ó1 card, which provides two hardware receive queues Multiqueue NICs provide multiple transmit and receive queues, allowing packets received by the NIC to be assigned to one of its receive queues. The NIC may distribute incoming traffic between the receive queues using a hash function. Each receive queue is assigned to a separate interrupt; by routing each of those interrupts to different CPUs or CPU cores, processing of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed improving performance. The hardware-based distribution of the interrupts, described above, is referred to as receive-side scaling (RSS). Purely software implementations also exist, such as the receive packet steering (RPS) and receive flow steering (RFS). Further performance improvements can be achieved by routing the interrupt requests to the CPUs or cores executing the applications that are the ultimate destinations for network packets that generated the interrupts. This technique improves Locality of reference and results in higher overall performance, reduced latency and better hardware utilization because of the higher utilization of CPU caches and fewer required context switches. Examples of such implementations are the RFS and Intel Flow Director. With multi-queue NICs, additional performance improvements can be achieved by distributing outgoing traffic among different transmit queues. By assigning different transmit queues to different CPUs or CPU cores, internal operating system contentions can be avoided. This approach is usually referred to as transmit packet steering (XPS). Some products feature NIC partitioning (NPAR, also known as port partitioning) that uses SR-IOV virtualization to divide a single 10 Gigabit Ethernet NIC into multiple discrete virtual NICs with dedicated bandwidth, which are presented to the firmware and operating system as separate PCI device functions. TCP offload engine is a technology used in some NICs to offload processing of the entire TCP/IP stack to the network controller. It is primarily used with high-speed network interfaces, such as Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, for which the processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant. Some NICs offer integrated field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for user-programmable processing of network traffic before it reaches the host computer, allowing for significantly reduced latencies in time-sensitive workloads. Moreover, some NICs offer complete low-latency TCP/IP stacks running on integrated FPGAs in combination with userspace libraries that intercept networking operations usually performed by the operating system kernel; Solarflare's open-source OpenOnload network stack that runs on Linux is an example. This kind of functionality is usually referred to as user-level networking.

Early life He was born in Dublin, of an old Irish Roman Catholic family, the son of Martin Shee, a merchant, who regarded the profession of a painter as an unsuitable occupation for a descendant of the Shees. His son Martin nevertheless studied art in the Royal Dublin Society and came to London. There, in 1788, he was introduced by Edmund BurkeTHE EUROPEAN MAGAZINE, AND LONDON REVIEW: ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE LITERATURE, HISTORY, BIOGEAPHY, POLITICS, ART, MANNERS, AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE AGE. to Joshua Reynolds, on whose advice he studied in the schools of the Royal Academy of Arts. Career In 1789 he exhibited his first two pictures, the \\"Head of an Old Man\\" and \\"Portrait of a Gentleman.\\" Over the next ten years he steadily increased in practice. He was chosen an associate of the Royal Academy in 1798, in 1789 he married Mary, eldest daughter of James Power of Youghal, and in 1800 he was elected a Royal Academician. He moved to George Romney's former house at 32 Cavendish Square, and set up as his successor. Shee continued to paint with great readiness of hand and fertility of invention, although his portraits were eclipsed by more than one of his contemporaries, and especially by Thomas Lawrence. The earlier portraits of the artist are carefully finished, easy in action, with good drawing and excellent discrimination of character. They show an undue tendency to redness in the flesh painting‚Äîa defect which is still more apparent in his later works, 'in which the handling is less \\"square,\\" crisp and forcible. In addition to his portraits he executed various subjects and historical works, such as Lavinia, Belisarius, his diploma picture \\"Prospero and Miranda\\", and the \\"Daughter of Jephthah.\\" =Writing= Portrait of William Roscoe, 1815‚Äì1817 In 1805 he published a poem consisting of Rhymes on Art, and a second part followed in 1809. Lord Byron spoke well of it in his English Bards and Scotch Reviewers. Shee published another small volume of verse in 1814, entitled The Commemoration of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other Poems, but this was less successful. He also produced a tragedy, Alasco, set in Poland. The play was accepted at Covent Garden, but was refused a licence, on the grounds that it contained treasonable allusions, and Shee angrily resolved to make his appeal to the public. He carried out his threat in 1824, but Alasco was still on the list of unacted dramas in 1911. He also published two novels ‚Äì Oldcourt (1829, in three volumes) and Cecil Hyde (1834). On the death of Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1830, Shee was chosen president of the Royal Academy in his stead and shortly afterwards received a knighthood. In 1831 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In an examination before the parliamentary committee of 1836 concerning the functions of the Royal Academy, he ably defended its rights. He continued to paint till 1845, when illness made him retire to Brighton. He was deputised for at the Academy by J. M. W. Turner, who had appointed him a trustee of the projected Turner almshouse. From 1842‚Äì1849, he was the first president of the Birmingham Society of Artists. Death Shee died in Brighton in 1850 and was buried in the western extension to St Nicholas' Churchyard in Brighton. His headstone remains, but has been laid flat and moved to the perimeter of the site. Personal life Shee had three sons, who became successful barristers, and three daughters. Descendants of one of the sons was George Archer-Shee, whose story inspired The Winslow Boy, a play written by Terence Rattigan and his older half-brother Martin Archer- Shee MP. Shee's descendant Mary Archer-Shee supports the campaign for the fulfilment of Turner's wishes for his bequests.

In physics, it refers to the information of a physical system. Physical information is an important concept used in a number of fields of study in physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, the form of physical information known as quantum information is used in many descriptions of quantum phenomena, such as quantum observation, quantum entanglement and the causal relationship between quantum objects that carry out either or both close and long-range interactions with one another. In a general sense, information is that which resolves uncertainty, which is due to the fact that it describes the details of that which is associated with the uncertainty. The description itself is, however, divorced from any type of language. When clarifying the subject of information, care should be taken to distinguish between the following specific cases: * The phrase instance of information refers to the specific instantiation of information (identity, form, essence) that is associated with the being of a particular example of a thing. (This allows for the reference to separate instances of information that happen to share identical patterns.) * A holder of information is a variable or mutable instance that can have different forms at different times (or in different situations). * A piece of information is a particular fact about a thing's identity or properties, i.e., a portion of its instance. * A pattern of information (or form) is the pattern or content of an instance or piece of information. Many separate pieces of information may share the same form. We can say that those pieces are perfectly correlated or say that they are copies of each other, as in copies of a book. * An embodiment of information is the thing whose essence is a given instance of information. * A representation of information is an encoding of some pattern of information within some other pattern or instance. * An interpretation of information is a decoding of a pattern of information as being a representation of another specific pattern or fact. * A subject of information is the thing that is identified or described by a given instance or piece of information. (Most generally, a thing that is a subject of information could be either abstract or concrete; either mathematical or physical.) * An amount of information is a quantification of how large a given instance, piece, or pattern of information is, or how much of a given system's information content (its instance) has a given attribute, such as being known or unknown. Amounts of information are most naturally characterized in logarithmic units. As the above usages are all conceptually distinct from each other, overloading the word \\"information\\" (by itself) to denote (or connote) several of these concepts simultaneously can lead to confusion. Accordingly, this article uses more detailed phrases, such as those shown in bold above, whenever the intended meaning is not made clear by the context. Classical versus quantum information The instance of information that is contained in a physical system is generally considered to specify that system's \\"true\\" state. (A realist would assert that a physical system always has a true state of some sort‚Äîwhether classical or quantum‚Äîeven though, in many practical situations, the system's true state may be largely unknown.) When discussing the information that is contained in physical systems according to modern quantum physics, we must distinguish between classical information and quantum information. Quantum information specifies the complete quantum state vector (or equivalently, wavefunction) of a system, whereas classical information, roughly speaking, only picks out a definite (pure) quantum state if we are already given a prespecified set of distinguishable (orthogonal) quantum states to choose from; such a set forms a basis for the vector space of all the possible pure quantum states (see pure state). Quantum information could thus be expressed by providing (1) a choice of a basis such that the actual quantum state is equal to one of the basis vectors, together with (2) the classical information specifying which of these basis vectors is the actual one. (However, the quantum information by itself does not include a specification of the basis, indeed, an uncountable number of different bases will include any given state vector.) Note that the amount of classical information in a quantum system gives the maximum amount of information that can actually be measured and extracted from that quantum system for use by external classical (decoherent) systems, since only basis states are operationally distinguishable from each other. The impossibility of differentiating between non-orthogonal states is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, equivalent to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Because of its more general utility, the remainder of this article will deal primarily with classical information, although quantum information theory does also have some potential applications (quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation) that are currently being actively explored by both theorists and experimentalists.Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Cambridge University Press, 2000. Quantifying classical physical information An amount of (classical) physical information may be quantified, as in information theory, as follows.Claude E. Shannon and Warren Weaver, Mathematical Theory of Communication, University of Illinois Press, 1963. For a system S, defined abstractly in such a way that it has N distinguishable states (orthogonal quantum states) that are consistent with its description, the amount of information I(S) contained in the system's state can be said to be log(N). The logarithm is selected for this definition since it has the advantage that this measure of information content is additive when concatenating independent, unrelated subsystems; e.g., if subsystem A has N distinguishable states (I(A) = log(N) information content) and an independent subsystem B has M distinguishable states (I(B) = log(M) information content), then the concatenated system has NM distinguishable states and an information content I(AB) = log(NM) = log(N) + log(M) = I(A) + I(B). We expect information to be additive from our everyday associations with the meaning of the word, e.g., that two pages of a book can contain twice as much information as one page. The base of the logarithm used in this definition is arbitrary, since it affects the result by only a multiplicative constant, which determines the unit of information that is implied. If the log is taken base 2, the unit of information is the binary digit or bit (so named by John Tukey); if we use a natural logarithm instead, we might call the resulting unit the \\"nat.\\" In magnitude, a nat is apparently identical to Boltzmann's constant k or the ideal gas constant R, although these particular quantities are usually reserved to measure physical information that happens to be entropy, and that are expressed in physical units such as joules per kelvin, or kilocalories per mole-kelvin. Physical information and entropy An easy way to understand the underlying unity between physical (as in thermodynamic) entropy and information-theoretic entropy is as follows: > Entropy is simply that portion of the (classical) physical information > contained in a system of interest (whether it is an entire physical system, > or just a subsystem delineated by a set of possible messages) whose identity > (as opposed to amount) is unknown (from the point of view of a particular > knower). This informal characterization corresponds to both von Neumann's formal definition of the entropy of a mixed quantum state (which is just a statistical mixture of pure states; see von Neumann entropy), as well as Claude Shannon's definition of the entropy of a probability distribution over classical signal states or messages (see information entropy). Incidentally, the credit for Shannon's entropy formula (though not for its use in an information theory context) really belongs to Boltzmann, who derived it much earlier for use in his H-theorem of statistical mechanics.Carlo Cercignani, Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms, Oxford University Press, 1998. (Shannon himself references Boltzmann in his monograph.) Furthermore, even when the state of a system is known, we can say that the information in the system is still effectively entropy if that information is effectively incompressible, that is, if there are no known or feasibly determinable correlations or redundancies between different pieces of information within the system. Note that this definition of entropy can even be viewed as equivalent to the previous one (unknown information) if we take a meta- perspective, and say that for observer A to \\"know\\" the state of system B means simply that there is a definite correlation between the state of observer A and the state of system B; this correlation could thus be used by a meta- observer (that is, whoever is discussing the overall situation regarding A's state of knowledge about B) to compress his own description of the joint system AB.Michael P. Frank, \\"Physical Limits of Computing\\", Computing in Science and Engineering, 4(3):16-25, May/June 2002. http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/physlim/plpaper.html Due to this connection with algorithmic information theory,W. H. Zurek, \\"Algorithmic randomness, physical entropy, measurements, and the demon of choice,\\" in (Hey 1999), pp. 393-410, and reprinted in (Leff & Rex 2003), pp. 264-281. entropy can be said to be that portion of a system's information capacity which is \\"used up,\\" that is, unavailable for storing new information (even if the existing information content were to be compressed). The rest of a system's information capacity (aside from its entropy) might be called extropy, and it represents the part of the system's information capacity which is potentially still available for storing newly derived information. The fact that physical entropy is basically \\"used-up storage capacity\\" is a direct concern in the engineering of computing systems; e.g., a computer must first remove the entropy from a given physical subsystem (eventually expelling it to the environment, and emitting heat) in order for that subsystem to be used to store some newly computed information. Extreme physical information In a theory developed by B. Roy Frieden,B. Roy Frieden, Science from Fisher Information, Cambridge University Press, 2004. \\"physical information\\" is defined as the loss of Fisher information that is incurred during the observation of a physical effect. Thus, if the effect has an intrinsic information level J but is observed at information level I, the physical information is defined to be the difference I ‚àí J. This defines an information Lagrangian. Frieden's principle of extreme physical information or EPI states that extremalizing I ‚àí J by varying the system probability amplitudes gives the correct amplitudes for most or even all physical theories. The EPI principle was recently proven. It follows from a system of mathematical axioms of L. Hardy defining all known physics.

It depicts a scene from the Kalevala in which Kullervo curses beasts from the woods to attack his tormenter, the Maiden of the North. Kullervo is an ill- fated character in the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled by Elias L√∂nnrot. Growing up in the aftermath of the massacre of his entire tribe, he comes to realise that the same people who had brought him up, the tribe of Untamo, were also the ones who had slain his family. As a child, he is sold into slavery and mocked and tormented further. When he finally runs away from his masters, he discovers surviving members of his family, only to lose them again. He seduces a girl who turns out to be his own sister, having thought his sister dead. When she finds out it was her own brother who seduced her, she commits suicide. Kullervo becomes mad with rage, returns to Untamo and his tribe, destroys them using his magical powers, and commits suicide. At the end of the poem the old sage V√§in√§m√∂inen warns all parents against treating their children too harshly.  Story  The story of Kullervo is laid out in runes (chapters) 31 through 36 of the Kalevala. = Rune 31 ‚Äì Kullervo, son of Evil = Kullervo Tearing His Swaddling Clothes, Carl Eneas Sj√∂strand, 1858 Untamo is jealous of his brother Kalervo, and the strife between the brothers is fed by numerous petty disputes. Eventually Untamo's resentment turns into open warfare, and he kills all of Kalervo's tribe save for one pregnant girl called Untamala, whom Untamo enslaves as his maid. Shortly afterwards, Untamala gives birth to a baby boy she names Kullervo. When Kullervo is three months old, he can be heard vowing revenge and destruction upon Untamo's tribe. Untamo attempts to kill Kullervo three times (by drowning, fire, and hanging). Each time, the infant Kullervo is saved by his latent magical powers. Untamo allows the child to grow up, then tries three times to find employment for him as a servant in his household, but all three attempts fail as Kullervo's wanton and wild nature makes him unfit for any domestic task. In the end, Untamo decides to rid himself of the problem by selling Kullervo to Ilmarinen as a slave. =Rune 32 ‚Äì Kullervo as a shepherd= Episode from Kalevala (Kullervo carves his name into an oak), , 1897 The boy is raised in isolation because of his status as a slave, his fierce temper, and because people fear his growing magical skills. The only memento that the boy retains from his previous life in a loving family is an old knife that'd been passed along with him as an infant. Pohjan Neito/Tyt√§r (Maiden/Daughter of the North), wife of Ilmarinen, enjoys tormenting the slave boy, now a youth, and sends Kullervo out to herd her cows with a loaf of bread with stones baked into it. This chapter includes a lengthy magical poem invoking various deities to grant their protection over the herd and to keep the owners prosperous. =Rune 33 ‚Äì Kullervo and the cheat-cake= Kullervo sits down to eat, but his beloved heirloom knife breaks on one of the stones in the bread. Kullervo is overwhelmed with rage. He drives the cows away to the fields, then summons up bears and wolves from the woods, making them appear like cows instead. He herds these to Ilmarinen's house and tells the wicked mistress of the house to milk them, upon which they turn back into wolves and bears and maul her. As she lies there bleeding, she invokes the high god Ukko to kill Kullervo with a magic arrow, but Kullervo prays for the spell to kill her instead for her wickedness, which it indeed does. =Rune 34 ‚Äì Kullervo finds his tribe= Kullervo then flees from slavery and finds that his family is actually still alive except for his sister, who has disappeared and is feared dead. =Rune 35 ‚Äì Kullervo's deeds= Kullervo's father has no more success than Untamo in finding work suited for his son, and thus sends the young man to collect taxes due to his tribe. On his way back home in his sleigh, Kullervo propositions several girls he sees on the way: all of them reject him. Finally, he meets a beggar-girl who also rejects him at first, struggling and screaming when he pulls her into his sleigh. But he starts talking to her sweetly and shows her all the gold he's collected during his trip, bribing her into sleeping with him. Afterwards, she asks who he is, and as she realises he's her own brother, she commits suicide by throwing herself into the rapidly rushing river nearby. The distraught Kullervo returns to his family and tells his mother what happened. =Rune 36 ‚Äì Kullervo's victory and suicide= Kullervo vows revenge on Untamo. One by one, his family members try to dissuade him from the fruitless path of evil and revenge. His mother asks what will become of her and Kullervo's father in their old age, and what will become of Kullervo's siblings if he's not there to take care of them, but Kullervo only replies that they can all die for all he cares‚Äîall he cares about is revenge. As he leaves, he asks if his father, brother and sister will mourn him if he dies, but they say they won't‚Äîthat they'd rather wait for a better son and brother to be born who is not so full of wickedness. Finally, Kullervo asks his mother if she'll weep for him, and she replies that she will, even if she knows him to be wrong. Kullervo hardens his heart and refuses to reconsider, and goes to war full of haughty pride, singing and playing his horn. Kullervo Sets Off for War, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, 1901 He becomes so obsessed with his revenge that even as he learns of the deaths of his family members during his journey, he doesn't even stop to honour their deaths, apart from weeping a little for his mother‚Äîyet he does not pause in his quest for revenge. He prays to the high god Ukko to get from him a magical broadsword, which he then uses to slay Untamo and his tribe, sparing no one, burning down his entire village. When he returns home, he finds the dead bodies of his own family littered about the estate. His mother's ghost speaks to him from her grave and advises him to take his dog and go to the wild woods for shelter. He does so, but instead of finding shelter, he only discovers the place by the river where he'd seduced his sister, the earth still mourning out loud of his ruining of her: no plants grow in the spot where he'd slept with her, either. Kullervo then asks of Ukko's sword if it will have his life. The sword eagerly accepts, noting that as a weapon it doesn't care whose blood it drinks‚Äîit's drunk both innocent and guilty blood before. Kullervo commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword. On hearing the news, V√§in√§m√∂inen comments that children should never be given away or ill-treated in their upbringing, lest like Kullervo they grow wicked and bereft of wisdom or honour.  Evaluation  Kullervo is fairly ordinary in Finnish mythology, in being a naturally talented magician; however, he is the only irredeemably tragic example. He showed great potential, but being raised badly, he became an ignorant, implacable, immoral and vengeful man. The death poem of Kullervo in which he, like Macbeth, interrogates his blade, is famous. Unlike the dagger in Macbeth, Kullervo's sword replies, bursting into song: it affirms that if it gladly participated in his other foul deeds, it would gladly drink of his blood also. This interrogation has been duplicated in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Children of H√∫rin with T√∫rin Turambar talking to his black sword, Gurthang, before committing suicide. (T√∫rin also, like Kullervo, unwittingly fell in love with his own sister and was devastated when he learned the truth, his sister also killing herself). Some literary critics have suggested that Kullervo's character is a bitter metaphorical representation of Finland's frequent struggles for independence. Certainly J√§√§k√§rimarssi (J√§ger March), a well-known Finnish military march, contains lines me nousemme kostona Kullervon/soma on sodan kohtalot koittaa (We arise like the wrath of Kullervo/so sweet are the fates of war to undergo). The story of Kullervo is unique among ancient myths in its realistic depiction of the effects of child abuse. The canto 36 ends in V√§in√§m√∂inen stating that an abused child will never attain the healthy state of mind even as adult, but will grow up as a very disturbed person. > :Silloin vanha V√§in√§m√∂inen, :kunpa kuuli kuolleheksi, :Kullervon > kaonneheksi, :sanan virkkoi, noin nimesi: :\\"Elk√∂tte, etinen kansa, :lasta > kaltoin kasvatelko :luona tuhman tuuittajan, :vierahan v√§syttelij√§n! :Lapsi > kaltoin kasvattama, :poika tuhmin tuuittama :ei tule √§ly√§m√§h√§n, :miehen > mielt√§ ottamahan, :vaikka vanhaksi el√§isi, :varreltansa vahvistuisi.\\".  In art  Kullervo is an eponymous 1860 play by Aleksis Kivi. An English translation, by Douglas Robinson, was published in 1993: Aleksis Kivi's Heath Cobblers and Kullervo. Kullervo is an eponymous 1892 choral symphony in five movements for full orchestra, two vocal soloists, and male choir by Jean Sibelius. It was opus 7 for Sibelius and his first successful work. Kullervo's Curse (1899) and Kullervo Rides to War (1901) are two paintings by Akseli Gallen-Kallela on the myth. In the J√§ger March (J√§√§k√§rin marssi) by Jean Sibelius one of the lines reads: Me nousemme kostona Kullervon, in English: We shall rise as Kullervo's revenge. Kullervo is the subject of a 1988 opera by Aulis Sallinen. Kullervo is also the subject of a brief symphonic poem composed in 1913 by Leevi Madetoja. In 2006, the Finnish metal band Amorphis released the album Eclipse, which tells the story of Kullervo according to a play by Paavo Haavikko. The play has been translated into English by Anselm Hollo. The Hilliard Ensemble commissioned an English language setting of Kullervo's story, Kullervo's Message, from Veljo Tormis. =Influence on J. R. R. Tolkien= J. R. R. Tolkien wrote an interpretation of the Kullervo cycle in 1914; the piece was finally published in its unfinished form as The Story of Kullervo in Tolkien Studies in 2010, as edited by Verlyn Flieger. It was re-published in book form in 2015 by HarperCollins. It was his first attempt at writing an epic narrative but was never completed. The story acted as a seed for the epic tale of T√∫rin Turambar which features in The Silmarillion, the \\"Narn i Ch√Æn H√∫rin\\" section of Unfinished Tales and, in a longer form, The Children of H√∫rin as well as the poem \\"The Lay of the Children of H√∫rin\\".

JCCs promote Jewish culture and heritage through holiday celebrations, Israel-related programming, and Jewish education. However, they are open to everyone in the community. The JCC Association is the continental umbrella organization for the Jewish Community Center movement, which includes more than 350 JCCs, YM‚ÄìYWHAs, and camp sites in the U.S. and Canada, in addition to 180 local JCCs in the former Soviet Union, 70 in Latin America, 50 in Europe, and close to 500 smaller centres in Israel.

(There are two other YM‚ÄìYWHA organizations in Manhattan, which are not affiliated with the 92nd Street Y. They are the 14th Street Y, and the YM & YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood. The 14th Street Y, in the Gramercy/East Village neighborhood, is a branch of the Educational Alliance. The Washington Heights organization serves a diverse community uptown.) In 1917, these organizations were combined into a Jewish Welfare Board. Following a merger of the Young Men's Hebrew Association, Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Education Alliance, the organization was renamed Jewish Community Center (JCC) in 1951. Many member organizations adopted the new name, but some other member organizations did not do so, particularly in the New York metropolitan area, such as: * In Manhattan, New York City, New York ** YM & YWHA of Washington Heights & Inwood ** 92nd Street Y, (formally, The Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, New York, New York) ** 14th Street Y * In Brooklyn, New York ** Boro Park Y in Borough Park, (founded as YMHA) ** Jewish Community House, or JCH, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn ** Kings Bay Y in Sheepshead Bay, with branches in northern Brooklyn ** Shorefront Y * Riverdale YM-YWHA in The Bronx, New York City, New York * Samuel Field Y and Central Queens Y in Queens, New York (two agencies merging ) * In New Jersey ** Center for Jewish Life (CJL) in East Brunswick, successor to YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley in Highland Park (closed 2006) ** YM-YWHA of Clifton/Passaic (name retained until its closing in 2011) ** YM-YWHA of North Jersey in Wayne (name retained until sale to Metro YMCA in 2011) * Jewish Community Alliance of Jacksonville, Florida An example of the objectives of Jewish Community Centers can be seen within the New Bedford, Massachusetts branch's Constitution. In January 1947, the Jewish Community Center of New Bedford listed the following objectives: * To foster and develop the highest values of Jewish spiritual and cultural life. * To provide social, educational, literary, benevolent, recreational and athletic activities for the benefit of Jewish men, women, and children of New Bedford. * To serve the spiritual, intellectual, social, and physical welfare of its members. * To fulfill the great ideals of American citizenship.Jewish Community Center Records, 1944‚Äì1977.

Services The indoor pool at the YMHA in Winnipeg, Manitoba JCC Association offers a wide range of services and resources to help its affiliates to provide educational, cultural, social, Jewish identity-building, and recreational programs for people of all ages and backgrounds. JCC Association supports the largest network of Jewish early childhood centers and Jewish summer camps in North America, and is also a U.S. government accredited agency for serving the religious and social needs of Jewish military personnel through JWB Jewish Chaplains Council.Torahs for Our Troops Some JCCs provide services for people with special needs, such as autism spectrum disorders and learning disabilities. In 2008, The Mandel JCC of Cleveland was awarded $652,500 in grant funding to be used for individuals with disabilities. Cleveland-area children and adults with emotional, physical and developmental disabilities now have many opportunities to get involved in fitness, wellness and recreational activities. Whenever possible, activities are inclusive and children are able to fully participate, usually with the assistance of an aide. As a rule, today JCCs are open to other ethnic groups as well, with a possible exception of strictly traditional Jewish activities. In fact, many JCCs sponsor local events. There are, however, many other activities that anyone can host at the JCC. Locations The Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center (DCJCC) is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood. President Calvin Coolidge spoke at the original ground-breaking ceremony on May 3, 1925. The Center closed in 1968, following race riots in Washington, D.C., later reopening in 1997. There are almost two dozen Jewish community centers in the New York metro area, providing a wide range of social, cultural, and educational services, ranging from lectures, concerts, theater performances, and dance recitals to health and fitness classes, job training workshops, and citizenship classes. Although the majority of JCCs are found on the East Coast, with 17 sites in Florida, JCCs operate in many other communities. For example, California has 17 locations‚Äîeight in the San Francisco Bay Area and nine scattered through Southern California‚Äîand the Chicago metropolitan area has 10. Almost all of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. now have at least one JCC, and a handful of smaller communities also have locations. JCCs all over the country sponsor film festivals and book fairs, bringing world-renowned writers and directors to smaller communities. JCC in Manhattan Hartford YWHA, gymnasium class, 1922-1923, Burr School gym Their programs and activities vary by location. Particularly noteworthy is the JCC in West Bloomfield, Michigan, which is the largest JCC in North America, and possibly the world. The Holocaust Memorial Center, which attracts many visitors to its programs and exhibits, used to be a part of the JCC of West Bloomfield, but recently opened a building of its own. The West Bloomfield JCC houses two gymnasiums which can be made into three gyms using a movable wall, a workout area, an indoor full size and kiddie pool, an outdoor full size pool, a kosher restaurant, a Michigan Jewish war veterans museum, an in line hockey center, a library, ceramics/art rooms, a large multi-purpose room (Handleman Hall), an art museum, an area dedicated to teaching and learning about tzedakah (charity) called Shalom Street, a performing arts theater in the basement, a preschool, offices for summer camps, the previously mentioned preschool, and other administrative offices and organizations. The top floor is completely dedicated to The Jean and Samuel Frankel Jewish Academy of Metropolitan Detroit, a Jewish High School which opened in 2000. The JCC building is on the Eugene and Marcia Applebaum Jewish Community Campus along with multiple living quarters for the elderly and mentally disabled and an Alzheimer's treatment building. The main swimming pool at the Jewish Community Center in Owings Mills, Maryland One recent addition to the family of JCC's in North America is The JCC in Manhattan. This eleven story building situated in Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood opened its doors in the winter of 2002. The JCC offers a diversity of programs, from parenting to fitness, and each year the organization produces Israel NonStop, a week-long festival presenting the most interesting and innovative Israeli musicians, authors, theatrical groups and films. JCC of Staten Island solar panels In 2011, the Joan and Alan Bernikow JCC of Staten Island installed solar panels as part of a solar thermal system. The solar panels are expected to reduce 27,500 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of planting two acres of Douglas fir trees every year. Its two dozen 10-foot solar panels will keep the building's hot water at a constant temperature of 180 degrees. Up next is the installation of a photo voltaic system, which will use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. This is part of JCC's vision of environmental sustainability, which benefits the community both ethically and economically. The Robert & Dorothy Ludwig Schenectady JCC became well known for their \\"million likes\\" photo that went viral in less than 48 hours. The photo showed three of its camp staff holding a sign that said \\"Our boss said that if this picture gets 1,000,000 likes that our summer camp can get an outdoor movie screen.\\" In less than a week the picture received over 300,000 likes and it was one of the most successful uses of social media ever by a JCC. Incidents and security In recent decades, several incidents that have taken place at JCCs and other Jewish-related locations across the United States and Canada, as well as the September 11 attacks, have prompted JCCs in all areas to increase security at their facilities. Some of these events have included: * The 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires resulted in 85 deaths and over 300 injured persons. * In 1997, a woman in Toronto was charged with kidnapping and other crimes in the unauthorized removal of her 5-year-old daughter from a JCC childcare center. The woman, a registered nurse who had previously lost custody of her child following a divorce, led police on a high-speed chase and crashed, causing minor injuries to both. * In the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting on August 10, 1999, a white supremacist opened fire and wounded four children and one adult. All survived, but the shooter was later convicted of homicide in a separate incident. * In the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting on July 29, 2006, one person was killed when a Muslim man named Naveed Afzal Haq opened fire. This shooting was in response to the offender's anger at the United States for the Iraq War and its support for Israel. * In the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting on April 13, 2014, a white supremacist opened fire in the parking lot of the JCC of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas and at a nearby Jewish retirement home. Three were killed in the incident and two others were shot at but were unharmed. * Starting in 2017, over 100 JCCs received bomb threats. By March, two suspects were arrested: Juan M. Thompson, a former journalist who was attempting to frame his ex-girlfriend for making antisemitic threats; and an unidentified, mentally ill 18-year-old Israeli-American man.http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Dual-US-Israeli-citizen-behind-most-JCC- bomb-threat-calls-484990 who in April 2017 was charged in an Israeli court with several crimes including an attempt to extort a United States senator, \\"publishing false reports causing public panic, conspiring to commit a crime, hacking computers to commit a crime, and violations of money-laundering laws\\". The indictment alleges that he threatened \\"2,000 different institutions around the world, including the Israeli embassy in Washington, the Israeli consulate in Miami, schools, malls, police stations, hospitals and airlines.\\" In the same month he faced a similar indictment in a Florida court which included 28 crimes.\\"JCC Bomb Hoaxer Indicted in Israel; Charged With Threatening to Kill Ex-Pentagon Official's Kids\\", Haaretz, April 24, 2017 New security measures now being implemented include the mandatory display of photo ID (for non- members) upon entry to the building, background checks of prospective employees and members, and police officers or security guards being stationed on premises. Childcare areas now have their access restricted to those who have legitimate reason to enter, and removal of a child, which is tightly monitored, is permitted only by custodial parents and guardians and other authorized adults. In addition, many other new security features now reduce the likelihood of non-members gaining access to member-restricted areas.

The son of boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons, Gene Ammons is remembered for his accessible music, steeped in soul and R&B.; Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois, Ammons studied music with instructor Walter Dyett at DuSable High School. Ammons began to gain recognition while still at high school when in 1943, at the age of 18, he went on the road with trumpeter King Kolax's band. In 1944 he joined the band of Billy Eckstine (who bestowed on him the nickname \\"Jug\\" when straw hats ordered for the band did not fit), playing alongside Charlie Parker and later Dexter Gordon. Notable performances from this period include \\"Blowin' the Blues Away,\\" featuring a saxophone duel between Ammons and Gordon. After 1947, when Eckstine became a solo performer, Ammons then led a group, including Miles Davis and Sonny Stitt, that performed at Chicago's Jumptown Club. In 1949 Ammons replaced Stan Getz as a member of Woody Herman's Second Herd, and then in 1950 formed a duet with Sonny Stitt. The 1950s were a prolific period for Ammons and produced some acclaimed recordings such as \\"The Happy Blues\\" (1955). Musicians who played in his groups, apart from Stitt, included Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, Kenny Burrell, Mal Waldron, Art Farmer, and Duke Jordan. His later career was interrupted by two prison sentences for narcotics possession, the first from 1958 to 1960, the second from 1962 to 1969. He recorded as a leader for Mercury (1947‚Äì1949), Aristocrat (1948‚Äì1950), Chess (1950‚Äì1951), Prestige (1950‚Äì1952), Decca (1952), and United (1952‚Äì1953). For the rest of his career, he was affiliated with Prestige. After his release from prison in 1969, having served a seven-year sentence at Joliet penitentiary, he signed the largest contract ever offered at that time by Prestige's Bob Weinstock. Ammons had the first of two records released by Leonard Chess on the newly-formed Chess Records label in 1950, titled \\"My Foolish Heart\\" (Chess 1425); Muddy Waters was the second record, \\"Rolling Stone\\" (Chess 1426). Both records were released simultaneously. Ammons died in Chicago in 1974, at the age of 49, from bone cancer. Playing style Ammons and Von Freeman were the founders of the Chicago school of tenor saxophone. Ammons's style of playing showed influences from Lester Young as well as Ben Webster. These artists had helped develop the sound of the tenor saxophone to higher levels of expressiveness. Ammons, together with Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt, helped integrate their developments with the emerging \\"vernacular\\" of the bebop movement, and the chromaticism and rhythmic variety of Charlie Parker is evident in his playing. While adept at the technical aspects of bebop, in particular its love of harmonic substitutions, Ammons stayed in touch with the commercial blues and R&B; of his day. For example, in 1950 the saxophonist's recording of \\"My Foolish Heart\\" made Billboard Magazine's black pop charts. The soul jazz movement of the mid-1960s, often using the combination of tenor saxophone and Hammond B3 electric organ, counts him as a founder. With a thicker, warmer tone than Stitt or Gordon, Ammons could at will exploit a vast range of textures on the instrument, vocalizing it in ways that look forward to later artists like Stanley Turrentine, Houston Person, and even Archie Shepp. Ammons showed little interest, however, in the modal jazz of John Coltrane, Joe Henderson or Wayne Shorter that was emerging at the same time. Some ballad performances in his oeuvre are testament to an exceptional sense of intonation and melodic symmetry, powerful lyrical expressiveness, and mastery both of the blues and the bebop vernacular that can now be described as, in its own way, \\"classical\\". Instruments Early in his career Ammons played a Conn model 10M B-flat tenor saxophone eventually switching to a Selmer Mark VI. He is often pictured playing a Brilhart Ebolin mouthpiece. Legacy King Pleasure recorded his vocalese take on Ammons' composition \\"Hittin' The Jug\\" under the new title \\"Swan Blues\\". Santana (\\"Jungle Strut\\") and Les McCann (\\"Red Top\\") have also recorded Gene Ammons compositions. Ammons is considered a major influence on the style of popular jazz tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Gene Ammons among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The association also promotes Irish music and dance, as well as the Irish language. As of 2014, the organisation had over 500,000 members worldwide, and declared total revenues of ‚Ç¨65.6 million in 2017. The Games Administration Committee (GAC) of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) governing bodies organise the fixture list of Gaelic games within a GAA county or provincial councils. Gaelic football and hurling are the most popular activities promoted by the organisation, and the most popular sports in the Republic of Ireland in terms of attendances. Gaelic football is also the second most popular participation sport in Northern Ireland. The women's version of these games, ladies' Gaelic football and camogie, are organised by the independent but closely linked Ladies' Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association of Ireland respectively. GAA Handball is the Irish governing body for the sport of handball, while the other Gaelic sport, rounders, is managed by the GAA Rounders National Council (). Since its foundation in 1884, the association has grown to become a major influence in Irish sporting and cultural life, with considerable reach into communities throughout Ireland and among the Irish diaspora. Foundation and history Hayes' Hotel in Thurles, foundation site of the organization On 1 November 1884, a group of Irishmen gathered in the Hayes' Hotel billiard room to formulate a plan and establish an organisation to foster and preserve Ireland's unique games and athletic pastimes. And so, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded. The architects and founding members were Michael Cusack of County Clare, Maurice Davin, Joseph K. Bracken, Thomas St George McCarthy, a District Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary, P. J. Ryan of Tipperary, John Wyse Power, and John McKay. Maurice Davin was elected President, Cusack, Wyse-Power and McKay were elected Secretaries and it was agreed that Archbishop Croke, Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt would be asked to become Patrons. In 1922 it passed over the job of promoting athletics to the National Athletic and Cycling Association. Competitions The GAA organises a number of competitions at divisional, county, inter-county, provincial, inter-provincial and national (All-Ireland) levels. A number of competitions follow a progressive format in which, for example, the winners of a club county football competition progress to a competition involving the top clubs from each county in the province, with the champions from each province progressing through a series of national finals. Cultural activities The association has had a long history of promoting Irish culture. Through a division of the association known as Sc√≥r (Irish for \\"score\\"), the association promotes Irish cultural activities, running competitions in music, singing, dancing and storytelling. Rule 4 of the GAA's official guide states: > The Association shall actively support the Irish language, traditional Irish > dancing, music, song, and other aspects of Irish culture. It shall foster an > awareness and love of the national ideals in the people of Ireland, and > assist in promoting a community spirit through its clubs. The group was formally founded in 1969, and is promoted through various Association clubs throughout Ireland (as well as some clubs outside Ireland). Grounds √Åras Mhic Eiteag√°in clubhouse in Gweedore, County Donegal. These grounds resemble the typical clubhouses to be found in rural areas all over Ireland. The association has many stadiums scattered throughout Ireland and beyond. Every county, and nearly all clubs, have grounds on which to play their home games, with varying capacities and utilities. The hierarchical structure of the GAA is applied to the use of grounds. Clubs play at their own grounds for the early rounds of the club championship, while the latter rounds from quarter-finals to finals are usually held at a county ground, i.e. the ground where inter-county games take place or where the county board is based. The provincial championship finals are usually played at the same venue every year. However, there have been exceptions, such as in Ulster, where in 2004 and 2005 the Ulster Football Finals were played in Croke Park, as the anticipated attendance was likely to far exceed the capacity of the traditional venue of St Tiernach's Park, Clones. =Croke Park= Croke Park sports stadium in Dublin, Ireland. The pitch is used for Gaelic football, hurling, and camogie, and has also been used in the past for association football and rugby. It has a capacity of 82,300 people, making it the third largest stadium in Europe. Croke Park is the association's flagship venue and is known colloquially as Croker or Headquarters, since the venue doubles as the association's base. With a capacity of 82,300, it ranks among the top five stadiums in Europe by capacity, having undergone extensive renovations for most of the 1990s and early 21st century. Every September, Croke Park hosts the All-Ireland inter-county Hurling and Football Finals as the conclusion to the summer championships. Croke Park holds the All-Ireland club football and hurling finals. Croke Park is named after Archbishop Thomas Croke, who was elected as a patron of the GAA during the formation of the GAA in 1884. =Other grounds= The next three biggest grounds are all in Munster: Semple Stadium in Thurles, County Tipperary, with a capacity of 53,000, the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick, which holds 50,000, and P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh, County Cork, which can accommodate 45,000. Other grounds with capacities above 25,000 include: *Fitzgerald Stadium, in Killarney, a capacity of 43,180 *MacHale Park in Castlebar, the largest stadium in Connacht (and in the northern half of the country), a capacity of 42,000 *St Tiernach's Park in Clones, County Monaghan, hosts most Ulster finals, a capacity of 36,000 *Kingspan Breffni Park, in Cavan Town, County Cavan, which hosted International rules football series games in 2013, a capacity of 32,000 *Casement Park, in Belfast, a capacity of 32,600 *Nowlan Park, in Kilkenny, a capacity of 27,800 *O'Moore Park, in Portlaoise, County Laois, a capacity of 27,000 *Healy Park, in Omagh, County Tyrone, a capacity of 26,500 *Pearse Stadium in Galway, which has hosted International rules football series games, a capacity of 26,197 Research by former Fermanagh county footballer Niall Cunningham led to the publication in 2016 by his website, gaapitchlocator.net, of a map of 1,748 GAA grounds in Ireland, ranging from 24 grounds in his own county to 171 in Cork.GAA Pitch Locator Nationalism and community relations =Community associations within Northern Ireland= The association has, since its inception, been closely associated with Irish nationalism, and this has continued to the present, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, where the sports are played almost predominantly by members of the mainly Catholic nationalist community, and many in the Protestant unionist population consider themselves excluded by a perceived political ethos.Cronin, M. (2000), \\"Catholics and Sport in Northern Ireland: Exclusiveness or Inclusiveness?\\", International Sports Studies, Volume 22, Number 1, 2000, p.33-34. Available at .Cronin, M.

According to one sports historian, the GAA \\"is arguably the most striking example of politics shaping sport in modern history\\".R. Holt (1992), Sport and the British: a modern history, p. 240, Oxford. Cited in Garnham, N: Association Football and society in pre-partition Ireland, page 135. Ulster Historical Foundation, 2004 A perception within Northern Ireland unionist circles that the GAA is a nationalist organisation\\"The GAA is perceived by the Unionist community as a sectarian organisation ...\\", Sugden, J.

New York:Palgrave. or foreign sports) from GAA grounds. As a result, the GAA became a target for loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles when a number of GAA supporters were killed and clubhouses damaged. As the profile of Gaelic football has been raised in Ulster so too has there been an increase in the number of sectarian attacks on Gaelic clubs in Northern Ireland. Some of the protectionist rules are as follows: Rule 42 and other sports in GAA grounds Rule 42 (Rule 5.1 in the 2009 rulebook) prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA referred to by some as \\"garrison games\\" or foreign sports. Current rules state that GAA property may only be used for the purpose or in connection with the playing of games controlled by the association. Sports not considered 'in conflict' with the GAA have been permitted. On 16 April 2005 the GAA's congress voted to temporarily relax Rule 42 and allow international soccer and rugby to be played in the stadium while Lansdowne Road Football Ground was closed for redevelopment. The first soccer and rugby union games permitted in Croke Park took place in early 2007, the first such fixture being Ireland's home match in the Six Nations Rugby Union Championship against France. In addition to the opening of Croke Park to competing sports, local GAA units have sought to rent their facilities out to other sports organisations for financial reasons in violation of Rule 42. The continued existence of Rule 42 has proven to be controversial since the management of Croke Park has been allowed to earn revenue by renting the facility out to competing sports organisations, but local GAA units which own smaller facilities cannot. It is also said that it is questionable as to whether or not such rental deals would be damaging to the GAA's interests. Defunct rules The GAA has had some notable rules in the past which have since been abolished. Rule 21, instituted in 1897 when it was suspected that Royal Irish Constabulary spies were trying to infiltrate the organization, prohibited members of the British forces from membership of the GAA. The rule was abolished after an overwhelming majority voted for its removal at a special congress convened in November 2001. Rule 27, sometimes referred to as The Ban, dated from 1901 and banned GAA members from taking part in or watching non Gaelic games. During that time people such as Douglas Hyde, GAA patron and then President of Ireland, was expelled for attending a soccer international. Rule 27 was abolished in 1971. =Cross-community outreach in Ulster= The association points out the role of members of minority religions in the membership throughout its history. For example, the Protestant Jack Boothman was president of the organisation from 1993 to 1997, while Sam Maguire was a Church of Ireland member. Nonetheless, to address concerns of unionists, the association's Ulster Council has embarked on a number of initiatives aimed at making the association and Gaelic games more accessible to northern Protestants. In November 2008, the council launched a Community Development Unit, which is responsible for \\"Diversity and Community Outreach initiatives\\". The C√∫chulainn Initiative is a cross-community program aimed at establishing teams consisting of Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren with no prior playing experience. Cross-community teams such as the Belfast Cuchulainn under-16 hurling team have been established and gone on to compete at the Continental Youth Championship in the USA. Similar hurling and Gaelic football teams have since emerged in Armagh, Fermanagh, Limavady. David Hassan, from the University of Ulster, has written about the cross community work of the association and other sporting bodies in Ulster, and highlighted the work being done in this field. The 'Game of three-halves' cross-community coaching initiative was established in predominantly Protestant east Belfast in 2006. Organised through Knock Presbyterian Church, this scheme brings Association coaches to work alongside their soccer and rugby counterparts to involve primary school children at summer coaching camps. The Ulster Council is also establishing cross-community football and hurling teams in schools and is developing links with the Ulster-Scots Agency and the Church of Ireland. The Council has also undertaken a series of meetings with political parties and community groups who would have traditionally have had no involvement in the association. =Other community outreach= In January 2011, the then President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, announced the launch of an island-wide project called the \\"GAA Social Initiative\\". This aims to address the problem of isolation in rural areas where older people have limited engagement with the community. The initiative was later expanded by teaming up with the Irish Farmers Association to integrate that organisation's volunteers into the initiative. Participation outside Ireland =Clubs outside Ireland= Members of the Irish diaspora have set-up clubs in a number of regions and countries outside of Ireland, and there are reportedly GAA clubs in the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, China, continental Europe, and elsewhere outside of Ireland. =Internationals= While some units of the association outside Ireland participate in Irish competitions, the association does not hold internationals played according to the rules of either Gaelic football or hurling. Compromise rules have been reached with two \\"related sports\\". Hurlers play an annual fixture against a national shinty team from Scotland. International Rules Football matches have taken place between an Irish national team drawn from the ranks of Gaelic footballers, against an Australian national team drawn from the Australian Football League. The venue alternates between Ireland and Australia. In December 2006, the International series between Australia and Ireland was called off due to excessive violence in the matches, but resumed in October 2008 when Ireland won a two test series in Australia. The Irish welcomed the All Australian team at the headquarters of the GAA (Croke Park) on 21 November 2015. It was single one-off test match, which led the Irish to reclaim the Cormac McAnallen Cup by a score of 56‚Äì52. Winter training ban To address concerns about player burnout, the association adopted a rule in 2007 that prohibited collective training for inter-county players for a period of two months every winter. This has proven to be controversial in that it is difficult to enforce, and in the drive to stay competitive, managers have found ways to avoid it, such as organising informal 'athletic clubs' and other activities that they can use to work on the physical fitness of players without overtly appearing to be training specifically at Gaelic games.

It was founded in 1981 by Jimmy Lambatos and sold to Rick and Richard Schaden ten years later, before growing to nearly 5,000 restaurants afterwards. Quiznos was the second-largest submarine sandwich shop chain in North America, behind Subway. A 2016 survey indicated that Quiznos was the ninth-largest submarine sandwich shop chain based on sales. The publications Restaurant Business and Mashed.com reported in mid-2018 that Quizno had only 400 locations remaining by 2017 after a high of 4,700 locations in 2007 just a decade earlier, while, money.com reported in May 2018 that Quiznos had 1,500 locations across the U.S. History =Early history= The first Quiznos Subs restaurant The first Quiznos restaurant was opened in Denver, Colorado, by founder Jimmy Lambatos. At the time, Lambatos was an experienced chef, having previously worked as an executive chef for the Colorado Mine Co. Steakhouse, and having founded the Italian restaurant Footers in 1978. He founded Quiznos with partner Todd Disner in the spring of 1981. The first location was at the corner of 13th and Grant Streets in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of the city. According to Kevin Jenkins, \\"It was there that recipes for Quiznos special baguette-style bread, special dressings and unique recipes were created.\\" According to Patrick Sweeney, \\"The sandwich shop earned a following for its toasted subs that Lambatos said were inspired by the oven-baked sandwiches he enjoyed while growing up in New York.\\" Lambatos said of his decision to toast the submarine sandwiches at the first Quiznos that, \\"it's a signature type of thing. Heating anything brings out the flavors in food products.\\" The restaurant menu featured toasted submarine sandwiches, as well as salads, soups, and desserts. Alternate Link via ProQuest. =Expansion= Countries with current Quiznos operations After two years, the restaurant started offering franchises to facilitate expansion offering its first franchises in 1983. The franchises were offered under the name Quiznos American, Inc. By 1987, 12 Quiznos restaurant locations were operating in the United States. That year, Rick Schaden, at the age of 23, and his father, aviation attorney Richard Schaden, opened their first Quiznos franchise in a Boulder, Colorado, shopping center. They opened three additional restaurants before purchasing the 18-restaurant chain from the founders in January 1991 and renamed it the Quiznos Franchise Corp. Rick Schaden became the president, and then CEO, of Quiznos after the purchase. Jenkins wrote that Schaden, \\"began building a professional infrastructure to support franchise owners that included volume purchasing, standardized training, and operations procedures, as well as marketing support.\\" Quiznos was taken public in February 1994, with an initial public offering of one million shares of stock at $5 per share, resulting in a $4.4 million yield. By the end of 1995, Quiznos had 103 different locations. In 1997, Quiznos became the number-three submarine sandwich franchise in the world, with 278 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The following year, Quiznos Canada acquired the master franchise rights to Quiznos restaurants in Canada, as well as the master rights in the United Kingdom in 1999. Glenvista Enterprises then acquired the rights for several states in Australia. KMN USA LLC acquired the franchise rights for Japan, opening its first location in early 1999. The company again went private in June 2001. In 2005, the company partnered with Ray Wilson to open a new chain of fitness clubs called 123 Fit. At its peak in 2007, there were more than 5,000 Quiznos franchise locations. =International expansion= The first location in Canada (and outside of the United States) opened in Vancouver in 1996. The first European location opened in 2001 in Peterborough in the United Kingdom. In 2002, Wendy's acquired the rights to the brand for franchises in Australia, and later, New Zealand, but was unsuccessful in launching the chain in either country. The first location in Mexico opened in Monterrey in 2002. The first location in India opened in Hyderabad in 2011, followed by the first location in the Philippines opened in 2012. In 2013, Quiznos opened its first two locations in Russia during the same weekend in St. Petersburg. Quiznos opened its first Taiwan location in Taipei and also its first United Arab Emirates location in Abu Dhabi in September 2014. =Restructuring= Between 2007 and 2009, 1,000 Quiznos stores in the United States closed. After the closure of around 2,000 restaurants during the Great Recession, a majority stake in the company was purchased by Avenue Capital Group of New York in January 2012. According to Ed Sealover, the purchase was done in \\"a deal that eliminated about one-third of the company's $900 million debt and infused about $150 million cash into the company.\\" Avenue Capital Group brought on turnaround specialist Harsha V. Agadi as Quiznos executive chairman. They also brought on Stuart Mathis as CEO, and the former president of The UPS Store stated that the company would try to counteract shrinking sales by promoting \\"the quality of its food.\\" =Bankruptcy= On March 14, 2014, Quiznos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado. Quiznos said it would continue operating while it restructured its debt and made operational improvements. Quiznos emerged from bankruptcy about four months later on June 30, 2014, and reduced its debt by approximately $400 million. =Post-bankruptcy= On December 1, 2015, Quiznos opened a concept restaurant called Quiznos Grill hoping to re-brand its products and increase menu offerings. Initial reviews of this restaurant highlighted the high price (US$20) once items were added to the sandwich (vegetables, cheese, etc.) or meal (chips, drinks, etc.). In late 2016, the Quiznos Grill concept was abandoned and relaunched as Zeps Epiq Sandwiches. Some of the Quiznos Grill sandwiches remained on the menu, while vegetarian choices, salads, all-day breakfasts, and loaded tater tots were added. On June 11, 2018, Quiznos announced that it was acquired by California-based High Bluff Capital Partners. The chain will maintain its headquarters in Denver. Locations One of the first Quiznos branches in the Philippines. As of 2019 there are fewer than 800 Quiznos restaurants in the United States. The chain also said it planned to expand to locations in over 40 countries and territories, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central and South America, by 2012. In July 2013, the company stated it planned to expand into Russia, where it is looking to open about 500 stores. QSR wrote in November 2013 that, \\"Following its most recent international successes in Mexico, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates, Quiznos will bring toasted sandwiches to Indonesia with the signature of PT Quiznosindo as the brand's newest franchisor. The group, led by Tan Po Lian, plans to open 100 units in Indonesia over the next 10 years. Quiznos South Korea has seen a system wide 12 percent sales lift, largely due to a country-wide marketing campaign, featuring actor Lee Sang Yoon, launched in March 2013. Expansion into Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia is part of Quiznos' continued international development plan to open more than 1,000 international stores in more than 40 countries by 2020.\\" Advertising The company's first major advertising push was a successful advertising campaign during the 2002 Super Bowl. Early TV spots advertised the innovation of toasting sandwiches, as compared to the inventor of pants (humorously contrasted with men wearing bushes). One commercial in 2003 depicted a man (a then-unknown Jim Parsons) who had been \\"raised by wolves\\" by suckling at a mother wolf's teat. Other promotions include an early 2004 campaign featuring bizarre, rodent-like, singing creatures called Spongmonkeys, as well as a series of Quiznos commercials in Canada featuring hockey commentator Don Cherry. In 2005, Quiznos launched a campaign featuring Baby Bob. In June 2006, Quiznos revealed its new slogan: \\"Eat Up.\\" Ads nationwide feature a Quiznos sub with steam emanating from it with the tagline, \\"Mmmm... toasty.\\" Actor Michael Clarke Duncan formerly provided the voiceover for all Quiznos commercials. On September 18, 2006, Quiznos launched the most aggressive advertising campaign aimed at Subway. Dubbed the \\"Prime Rib Cheesesteak Challenge,\\" customers were asked to compare the brand new Prime Rib Cheesesteak against Subway's Cheesesteak sandwich. The claim is that the Prime Rib Cheesesteak has twice the meat of Subway's Cheesesteak. If the customers are not satisfied, then they can fill out a form, mail the form along with their receipt, and they will receive a coupon for a free sandwich. In subsequent advertisements, Quiznos was shown competing with the fictional \\"Wrong Way\\" restaurant based on competing restaurants. The Coca-Cola Company was originally the primary soft drink supplier for the franchise, until 2005. At that time, Coca-Cola signed an exclusive agreement to provide soft drinks to the competing Subway franchise. As a result, Quiznos signed an exclusive deal with PepsiCo (except in Canada and on college campuses that have exclusive deals with Coca-Cola) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (to serve Dr Pepper). In 2016, the company launched their mobile based loyalty program. This app was aimed at rewarding Quiznos' most loyal customers and to gather customer feedback to improve product and operations. =Mascots= In 2004, Quiznos started using the bizarre, fuzzy looking creatures called the Spongmonkeys (which were designed by Joel Veitch) in their advertising commercials. One of them plays a guitar, and the other sings a song called \\"We Love the Subs\\", in an apparent and shorter spoof of their original song, \\"We Like the Moon\\". Several commercials with the Spongmonkeys were released, including ones about rejoice and coupons. However, after a few months, Quiznos discontinued airing these commercials. An inflatable character costume that is in the style of a plastic Quiznos cup is used in and around the store. Lawsuits and controversies Quiznos has been the target of several lawsuits related to its treatment of franchisees, including lawsuits in New Jersey and Wisconsin. It has faced more lawsuits from franchisees than bigger chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and even its sandwich competitors Subway and Blimpie, according to an analysis by the legal research firm Thomson West. In February 2007, Quiznos franchisees filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status in Michigan. One lawsuit (filed in New Jersey and seeking class-action status) said that the astounding growth record of Quiznos was merely a mirage. In 2003 and 2004, Quiznos said it sold 234 \\"trade areas\\" in the state of New Jersey to franchisees, collecting the $25,000 franchisee fee, but none of these locations ever opened, according to the lawsuit. Three years after handing over her check for the fee, Elisa Whitehall said that she had yet to open a Quiznos in the location she bought and that Quiznos refused to return the fee. One lawsuit cited a memorandum drafted by a Quiznos lawyer in 2003 that stated, \\"40 percent of Quiznos units are not breaking even,\\" a fact that prospective franchisees say they were never told. The Small Business Administration said 23.4 percent of Quiznos franchises with SBA loans failed. In contrast, Subway had a 4.8 percent failure rate. As a single example of an unprofitable franchise, Fredrick N. Westerfield was running three Quiznos in Wisconsin. After spending $14,000 in personal savings to keep the stores running, he realized he had a debt of $750,000. He closed all his stores in 2005. \\"Customers used to come into the store and say to me, 'You must be rolling in the money,'\\" recalled Mr. Westerfield. \\"If they only knew.\\" In 2002, the Seattle Times reported that the company initially ignored the plight of a Quiznos employee who took over operations of one Quiznos store after the true owner abandoned it. Months later, the store was closed. In June 2004, the Quiznos at Downtown Crossing, Boston, was at the center of a hepatitis scare. In 2006, Quiznos sent letters to 300 franchises saying mystery shoppers would be coming to test their services. The company sued franchise owners Richard Piotrowski and Ellen Blickman for not putting enough meat in a prime rib sandwich. Piotrowski and Blickman countersued and won the lawsuit in 2009. Judge Morris Hoffman called the meat-weighing exercise and subsequent termination letters a \\"charade\\" aimed at bolstering a national ad campaign against rival Subway. On November 27, 2006, Bhupinder Baber, franchise owner of two Long Beach, California, Quiznos locations, committed suicide after a legal battle with the company. In his suicide note, Baber attributed mistreatment by Quiznos to driving him to suicide. The Toasted Subs Franchisee Association (TSFA), a group of franchisees, posted Baber's suicide note on its website, and intended to raise money for Baber's family. Quiznos attempted to terminate the TSFA's franchises. The TSFA in turn filed an injunction on December 15, 2006, in the District Court of Colorado. A 2014 article in the Long Beach Post suggested that the factors that contributed to Baber's suicide also led to the parent company's bankruptcy in 2014. As of July 1, 2010, Quiznos was close to reaching a settlement over the multiyear class-action lawsuit that covers nearly 10,000 of its current and former franchisees. The case comprises four separate class-action lawsuits dating back to 2006 which consolidated in 2009 ‚Äî involved allegations by attorneys for franchisees that Quiznos Franchise Co. LLC and other entities with ownership or control of the Quiznos chain had violated U.S. racketeering and corruption statutes. Also at issue was the chain's supply chain and food costs, marketing and advertising funds, and disputes among franchisees that agreed to, but did not open, locations and whether royalties are owed. Quiznos denied all claims made in the lawsuits and the settlement agreement involves no finding or admission of liability, nonetheless the cost to Quiznos has been estimated from $100 to $200 million while also forcing it to implement a new business plan \\"which puts more support into its franchisees\\".

He was briefly known as Abdullah Ibn Buhaina after he converted to Islam for a short time in the late 1940s. Blakey made a name for himself in the 1940s in the big bands of Fletcher Henderson and Billy Eckstine. He then worked with bebop musicians Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. In the mid-1950s, Horace Silver and Blakey formed the Jazz Messengers, a group that the drummer was associated with for the next 35 years. The group was formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, Johnny Griffin, Curtis Fuller, Chuck Mangione, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Cedar Walton, Woody Shaw, Terence Blanchard, and Wynton Marsalis. The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz calls the Jazz Messengers \\"the archetypal hard bop group of the late 50s\\". Blakey was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame (in 1981), the Grammy Hall of Fame (in 1998 and 2001), and was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1991. Childhood and early career Blakey was born on October 11, 1919, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, probably to a single mother who died shortly after his birth; her name is often cited as Marie Roddicker (or Roddericker) although Blakey's own 1937 marriage license shows her maiden name to have been Jackson. His biological father was Bertram Thomas Blakey, originally of Ozark, Alabama, whose family migrated northward to Pittsburgh sometime between 1900 and 1910. Blakey's uncle, Rubi Blakey, was a popular Pittsburgh singer, choral leader, and teacher who attended Fisk University. Blakey is described as having been \\"raised with his siblings by a family friend who became a surrogate mother\\"; he \\"received some piano lessons at school\\", and was able to spend some further time teaching himself. According to Leslie Gourse's biography, the surrogate mother figure was Annie Peron. The stories related by family and friends, and by Blakey himself, are contradictory as to how long he spent with the Peron family, but it is clear he spent some time with them growing up. Equally clouded by contradiction are stories of Blakey's early music career. It is agreed by several sources that by the time he was in seventh grade, Blakey was playing music full-time and had begun to take on adult responsibilities, playing the piano to earn money and learning to be a band leader. He switched from piano to drums at an uncertain date in the early 1930s. An oft-quoted account of the event states that Blakey was forced at gunpoint to move from piano to drums by a club owner, to allow Erroll Garner to take over on piano. The veracity of this story is called into question in the Gourse biography, as Blakey himself gives other accounts in addition to this one. The style Blakey assumed was \\"the aggressive swing style of Chick Webb, Sid Catlett and Ray Bauduc\\". From 1939 to 1944, Blakey played with fellow Pittsburgh native Mary Lou Williams and toured with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra. While sources differ on the timing, most agree that he traveled to New York with Williams in 1942 before joining Henderson a year later. (Some accounts have him joining Henderson as early as 1939.) While playing in Henderson's band, Blakey was involved in a scuffle with Georgia police and suffered injuries that caused him to be declared unfit for service in World War II. He led his own band at the Tic Toc Club in Boston for a short time. From 1944 to 1947, Blakey worked with Billy Eckstine's big band. Through this band, Blakey became associated with the bebop movement, along with his fellow band members Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Sarah Vaughan among others. After the Eckstine band broke up, Blakey states that he traveled to Africa for a time: \\"In 1947, after the Eckstine band broke up, we‚Äîtook a trip to Africa. I was supposed to stay there three months and I stayed two years because I wanted to live among the people and find out just how they lived and‚Äîabout the drums especially.\\" He stated in a 1979 interview, discussing the context of the decision at the time: Blakey is known to have recorded from 1947 to 1949. He studied and converted to Islam during this period, taking the name Abdullah Ibn Buhaina, although he stopped being a practicing Muslim in the 1950s and continued to perform under the name \\"Art Blakey\\" throughout his career. As the 1950s began, Blakey was backing musicians such as Davis, Parker, Gillespie, Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk; he is often considered to have been Monk's most empathetic drummer, and he played on both Monk's first recording session as a leader (for Blue Note Records in 1947) and his final one (in London in 1971), as well as many in between. Blakey toured with Buddy DeFranco from 1951 to 1953 in a band that also included Kenny Drew. The Jazz Messengers Blakey on a tour billed as part of the \\"Giants of Jazz\\" in Hamburg, Germany, in 1973 On December 17, 1947, Blakey led a group known as \\"Art Blakey's Messengers\\" in his first recording session as a leader, for Blue Note Records. The records were released as 78 rpm records at the time, and two of the songs were released on the \\"New Sounds\\" 10\\" LP compilation (BLP 5010). The octet included Kenny Dorham, Sahib Shihab, Musa Kaleem, and Walter Bishop, Jr. Around the same time (1947 or 1949) he led a big band called Seventeen Messengers. The band proved to be financially unstable and broke up soon after. The use of the Messengers tag finally stuck with the group co-led at first by both Blakey and pianist Horace Silver, though the name was not used on the earliest of their recordings. The \\"Jazz Messengers\\" name was first used for this group on a 1954 recording nominally led by Silver, with Blakey, Mobley, Dorham and Doug Watkins‚Äîthe same quintet recorded The Jazz Messengers at the Cafe Bohemia the following year, still functioning as a collective. Donald Byrd replaced Dorham, and the group recorded an album called simply The Jazz Messengers for Columbia Records in 1956. Blakey took over the group name when Silver left after the band's first year (taking Mobley and Watkins with him to form a new quintet), and the band name evolved to include Blakey's name, eventually settling upon \\"Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers\\". Blakey led the group for the rest of his life. It was the archetypal hard bop group of the 1950s, playing a driving, aggressive extension of bop with pronounced blues roots. Towards the end of the 1950s, the saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Benny Golson were in turn briefly members of the group. Golson, as musical director, wrote several jazz standards which began as part of the band book, such as \\"I Remember Clifford\\", \\"Along Came Betty\\", and \\"Blues March\\", and were frequently revived by later editions of the group. \\"Whisper Not\\" and \\"Are You Real\\" were other Golson compositions for Blakey. Performing at the Ume√• jazz festival, Sweden. 1979 From 1959‚Äì61, the group featured Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone, Lee Morgan on trumpet, pianist Bobby Timmons and Jymie Merritt on bass. The group recorded several albums for Blue Note Records including The Big Beat and A Night in Tunisia. From 1961‚Äì64, the band was a sextet that added trombonist Curtis Fuller and replaced Morgan, Timmons, and Merritt with Freddie Hubbard, Cedar Walton, and Reggie Workman, respectively. The group evolved into a proving ground for young jazz talent, and recorded albums such as Buhaina's Delight, Caravan, and Free For All. While veterans occasionally reappeared in the group, by and large, each iteration of the Messengers included a lineup of new young players. Having the Messengers on one's resume was a rite of passage in the jazz world, and conveyed immediate bona fides. Many Messenger alumni went on to become jazz stars in their own right, such as: Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Timmons, Curtis Fuller, Chuck Mangione, Keith Jarrett, Joanne Brackeen, Woody Shaw, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison and Mulgrew Miller. For a complete list of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers alumni, including some who did not actually record with the band, see The Jazz Messengers. Later career At radio interview, KJAZ, Alameda, California, October 11, 1982 Blakey went on to record dozens of albums with a constantly changing group of Jazz Messengers. He had a policy of encouraging young musicians: as he remarked on-mic during the live session which resulted in the A Night at Birdland albums in 1954: \\"I'm gonna stay with the youngsters. When these get too old I'll get some younger ones. Keeps the mind active.\\" After weathering the fusion era in the 1970s with some difficulty (recordings from this period are less plentiful and include attempts to incorporate instruments like electric piano), Blakey's band was revitalized in the early 1980s with the advent of neotraditionalist jazz. Wynton Marsalis was for a time the band's trumpeter and musical director, and even after Marsalis' departure Blakey's band continued as a proving ground for Johnny O'Neal, Philip Harper, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison and Kenny Garrett, among others. He continued performing and touring with the group through the end of the 1980s. Ralph Peterson, Jr. joined in 1983 as a second drummer due to Blakey's failing health. Ron Wynn notes that Blakey had \\"played with such force and fury that he eventually lost much of his hearing, and at the end of his life, often played strictly by instinct.\\" He stubbornly refused to wear a hearing aid, arguing that it threw his timing off, so most of the time he played by sensing vibrations. Javon Jackson, who played in Blakey's final lineup, claimed that he exaggerated the extent of his hearing loss. \\"In my opinion, his deafness was a little exaggerated, and it was exaggerated by him. He didn't hear well out of one ear, but he could hear just fine out the other one. He could hear you just fine when you played something badly and he was quick to say 'Hey, you missed that there.' But anything like 'I don't think I'll be available for the next gig', he'd say 'Huh? I can't hear you.'\\" Another bandmate, Geoffrey Keezer, claimed that 'He was selectively deaf. He'd go deaf when you asked him about money, but if it was real quiet and you talked to him one-on-one, then he could hear you just fine.'\\"Hard Bop Academy: The Sidemen of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Alan Goldsher, pp 81 Blakey's final performances were in July 1990. He died on October 16 of lung cancer. Drumming style Blakey assumed an aggressive swing style of contemporaries Chick Webb, Sid Catlett and Ray Bauduc early in his career, and is known, alongside Kenny Clarke and Max Roach as one of the inventors of the modern bebop style of drumming. Max Roach described him thus: His drumming form made continuing use of the traditional grip, though in later appearances he is also seen using a matched grip.See, for instance: \\"Art Blakey solo\\", available at YouTube In a 1973 drum battle with Ginger Baker he can be seen repeatedly changing grip during his performance. As the supporting materials for Ken Burns's series Jazz notes, \\"Blakey is a major figure in modern jazz and an important stylist in drums. From his earliest recording sessions with Eckstine, and particularly in his historic sessions with Monk in 1947, he exudes power and originality, creating a dark cymbal sound punctuated by frequent loud snare and bass drum accents in triplets or cross-rhythms.\\" This source continues: Legacy The legacy of Blakey and his bands is not only the music they produced, but also the opportunities they provided for several generations of jazz musicians. The Jazz Messengers nurtured and influenced many of the key figures of the hard bop movement of the late 1950s to early 1960s, and of the Neotraditionalist movement of the 1980s and 1990s, both of which had the Jazz Messengers in a stylistically seminal role. In the words of drummer Cindy Blackman shortly after Blakey's death, \\"When jazz was in danger of dying out [during the 1970s], there was still a scene. Art kept it going.\\" Blakey was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame (in 1982), the Grammy Hall of Fame (in 2001), and was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Art Blakey among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Personal life In addition to his musical interests, Blakey was described by Jerry \\"Tiger\\" Pearson as a storyteller, as having a \\"big appetite for music [...] women [and] food\\", and an interest in boxing.John Cohassey (2014), \\"My Friend Art Blakey: Recollections of a Jazz Fan from Detroit, by Jerry \\"Tiger\\" Pearson, as told to John Cohassey\\" (Supporting material for America's Cultural Rebels: Avant-Garde and Bohemian Artists, Writers and Musicians from the 1850s through the 1960s by Roy Kotynek and John Cohassey (Jefferson, NC:McFarland & Company); ; available here Blakey married four times, and had long-lasting and other relationships throughout his life. He married his first wife, Clarice Stewart, while yet a teen, then Diana Bates (1956), Atsuko Nakamura (1968), and Anne Arnold (1983). He had 10 children from these relationships ‚Äî daughters Gwendolyn, Evelyn, Jackie, Kadijah, Sakeena and Akira, and sons Art Jr., Takashi, Kenji and Gamal. Sandy Warren, another longtime companion of Blakey, published a book of reminiscences and favorite food recipes from the period of the late 1970s to early 1980s when Blakey lived in Northfield, New Jersey with Warren and their son, Takashi.Regina Schaffer, 2014, \\"Art Blakey will be remembered by Keith Hollis band, Jazz Vespers in Atlantic City Sunday\\", Atlantic City Insiders, January 14, 2014; available here Jeff Schwachter, 2010, \\"Art Blakey Topic of New Book by Atlantic City Author\\", Atlantic City Insiders, November 17, 2010; available here Jeff Schwachter, 2005, \\"Remembering the Messenger: Jazz legend Art Blakey and his small town Atlantic County digs\\", Atlantic City Insiders, October 27, 2005; available here Blakey traveled for a year in West Africa (1948) to explore the culture and religion of Islam he would adopt alongside changing his name; his conversion took place in the late 1940s at a time when other African-Americans were being influenced by the Ahmadi missionary Kahili Ahmed Nasir, according to the Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History, and at one time in that period, Blakey led a turbaned, Qur'an-reading jazz band called the 17 Messengers (perhaps all Muslim, reflecting notions of the Prophet's and music's roles as conduits of the divine message). A friend recollects that when \\"Art took up the religion [...] he did so on his own terms\\", saying that \\"Muslim imams would come over to his place, and they would pray and talk, then a few hours later [we] would go [...] to a restaurant [...and] have a drink and order some ribs\\", and suggests that reasons for the name change included the pragmatic: that \\"like many other black jazz musicians who adopted Muslim names\\", musicians did so to allow them to \\"check into hotels and enter 'white only places' under the assumption they were not African-American\\". Drummer Keith Hollis, reflecting on Blakey's early life, states that his fellow drummer \\"wound up doing drugs to cope\\"; like many of the era, Blakey and his bands were known for their drug use (namely heroin) while traveling and performing (with varying accounts of Blakey's influence on others in this regard).John Moultrie, 2013, \\"Gary Bartz Talks About Drug Use Among Jazz Greats\\", 2013 Jazz Festival (iRock Jazz Team, irockjazz.com); available here Other specific recollections have Blakey forswearing serious drink while playing (after being disciplined by drummer Sid Catlett early in his career for drinking while performing), and suggest that the influence of \\"clean- living cat\\" Wynton Marsalis led to a period where he was less affected by drugs during performances. Blakey was a heavy smoker; he appears in a cloud of smoke on the Buhaina's Delight album cover,LondonJazzCollector, 2011, \\"Art Blakey \\"Buhaina's Delight\\" (1961)\\"; and in extended footage of a 1973 appearance with Ginger Baker, Blakey begins a long drummers' \\"duel\\" with cigarette alight. Death Blakey had been living in Manhattan when he died on October 16, 1990 of lung cancer, five days after his 71st birthday, at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was survived by six daughters (Gwendolyn, Evelyn, Jackie, Sakeena, Kadijah and Akira), and three sons (Takashi, Gamal, and Kenji). At his funeral at the Abyssinian Baptist Church on October 22, 1990, a tribute group assembled of past Jazz Messengers including Brian Lynch, Javon Jackson, Geoffrey Keezer, Wynton Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, Valery Ponomarev, Benny Golson, Donald Harrison, Essiet Okon Essiet, and drummer Kenny Washington performed several of the band's most celebrated tunes, such as Golson's \\"Along Came Betty\\", Bobby Timmons' \\"Moanin'\\", and Wayne Shorter's \\"One by One\\". Jackson, a member of Blakey's last Jazz Messengers group, recalled how his experiences with the drummer changed his life, saying that \\"He taught me how to be a man. How to stand up and be accounted for\\". Musicians Jackie McLean, Ray Bryant, Dizzy Gillespie, and Max Roach also paid tribute to Blakey at his funeral.

In modern social usage, a chaperon (frequent in British spelling) or chaperone (usual in American spelling) is a responsible adult who accompanies and supervises young people. By extension, the word chaperone is used in clinical contexts. Origin Mrs. Chambers (chaperone), Bonnie Mealing, Clare Dennis, Frances Bult, Eileen Wearne, Thelma Kench (N.Z. sprinter) at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, USA The word derives figuratively from the French word chaperon (originally from the Late Latin cappa, meaning \\"cape\\") which referred to a hood that was worn by individuals generally. A chaperone was part of the costume of the Knights of the Garter when they were in full dress and, probably, since the Knights were court attendants, the word chaperon changed to mean escort. An alternative explanation comes from the sport of falconry, where the word meant the hood placed over the head of a bird of prey to stop its desire to fly. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the noun (in its figurative sense of escort of females) is attested from 1721, and the verb 'to chaperon' from 1811. Traditional institution Although the supervision of vulnerable women in public spaces may be common in many cultures, the specific word chaperon began to be used in the eighteenth century to denote a particular social institution, namely, a woman who would accompany a young unmarried woman in public, and especially where she might be expected to meet a man. In circumstances where, for whatever reason, the mother was unavailable to perform this function, another woman, usually well known to the family, was chosen. A chaperon was usually expected to be a married woman, although a respected, older unmarried or widowed woman (typically someone beyond child-bearing age) was often acceptable. Chaperones were usually not required in situations where an unmarried woman's father was able to accompany his daughter(s). Chaperones for young men were not commonly employed in Western society until the latter half of the 20th century, although depending on the precise nature of the business he was on, a young male who temporarily left the company of their parents would usually find himself under the supervision of coaches, employers or other such individuals (such personnel were not typically seen to be chaperones in the traditional sense). Duenna English-speaking cultures supposed, perhaps correctly, that the institution was particularly strict in southern Europe, especially in Spain, to which they attributed the word duenna, a misspelling of the Spanish word \\"due√±a\\".The Spanish word due√±a was supposed to denote a particularly eagle-eyed supervisor of unmarried females. In fact, in Spain, the word due√±a (from the Latin domina) has no particular connotations of chaperonage and merely denotes a female proprietor, supervisor of servants, or married woman. In Spain a chaperon is called a carabina; the word chaperona is not usually found except in Central America. (Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa≈Ñola: \\"due√±a\\", \\"carabina\\", \\"chaperon\\".) By an extended usage the word duenna has come to mean a young woman's female companion from any culture, particularly one who is exceedingly strict (the Oxford English Dictionary instances \\"There is no duenna so rigidly prudent as ... a superannuated coquette\\"Citing Washington Irvine, The sketch book of Geoffrey Clayton, 20, New York, 1819. and even any disapproving person irrespective of gender (where it instances \\"He drew his lips together in that duenna-like way\\".Citing P.G. Wodehouse, Luck of Bodkins, XVI, 183. Current usage Chaperones were expected to exercise stern authority over their charges, this, combined with the fact that young people typically had little or no say in the choice of a chaperone, could lead to resistance and resentment on the part of the young people being supervised. One particular effect of the perceived need for the chaperoning of young women was that the early development of women's sport, already impaired by a reluctance on the part of society to accept the presence of females in organized sports, was further inhibited for several decades due to the extra costs involved in hiring chaperones. The practice of one-on-one chaperones for social occasions has largely fallen out of use in Western society. Today, the term is most often applied to parents and teachers who supervise groups of young people (often of mixed genders) at school dances, sporting events, field trips and other such events. Often, for short trips where adults are required to perform other functions (such as coaching) these adults will be expected to perform chaperoning duties as well. This practice both saves money and has the potential to foster a better relationship between young people and the adults chaperoning them. A major drawback of such an arrangement is that the adults involved are often hired for other reasons besides their qualifications to supervise children and adolescents. There is, therefore, the potential that such adults may be presented an opportunity to engage in physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse of their charges. Therefore, in present-day situations where young people plan to be away from their families for an extended period of time, such as modern-day cinema, theatre and television productions where the cast includes children as well as other areas such as high-level sport or modeling, there is often a legal obligation to have a staff role of a chaperone, responsible for their general safety and well-being while away from their parents. Chaperones must be qualified in specialist childcare areas such as pediatric first aid, child protection, and all required reporting and workforce requirements. In culture The plot of Brandon Thomas's 1892 farce play Charley's Aunt revolves around the need for a chaperone. E. M. Forster's 1908 novel A Room with a View features a character, Charlotte Bartlett, who functions as a chaperone for her younger cousin Lucy Honeychurch. The 2006 musical spoof The Drowsy Chaperone centers upon an unnamed, alcoholic chaperone to the bride-to-be, Janet Van de Graaff. Cosmo Kramer acts as a chaperone for Jerry Seinfeld and Miss Rhode Island in an episode of Seinfeld.

There have also been Earls of Buckingham and Marquesses of Buckingham. History =Dukes of Buckingham, first creation (1444)= Arms of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1402‚Äì1460) The first creation of the dukedom was on 14 September 1444, when Humphrey Stafford, 6th Earl of Stafford, was made Duke of Buckingham. On his father's side, Stafford was descended from Edmund de Stafford, who had been summoned to Parliament as Lord Stafford in 1299. The second Baron had been created Earl of Stafford in 1351. On his mother's side, Stafford was the son of Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Buckingham, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham (later Duke of Gloucester), youngest son of King Edward III of England. Stafford was an important supporter of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, and was killed at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460. The 1st Duke of Buckingham was succeeded by his grandson, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who aided Richard III in his claiming the throne in 1483 (Edward IV of England's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville having been declared null and void and Edward's sons illegitimate by Act of Parliament Titulus Regius), but who then led a revolt against Richard and was executed later that same year. His titles were forfeited along with the dukedom. His son, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was restored to the title upon Henry VII's accession to the throne in 1485, but he was ultimately executed for treason in 1521 due to his opposition to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII's chief advisor. At this time the title became extinct; it was posthumously attainted in 1523. =Dukes of Buckingham, second creation (1623)= Arms of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592‚Äì1628) The second creation of the dukedom was in 1623 for George Villiers, a favourite of James I of England. He had previously been made Baron Whaddon, of Whaddon in the County of Buckingham, and Viscount Villiers in 1616, then Earl of Buckingham in 1617, then Marquess of Buckingham in 1618 until he was also created Earl of Coventry and Duke of Buckingham in 1623. Buckingham, who continued in office as chief minister into the reign of James's son, Charles I, was responsible for a policy of war against Spain and France. In 1628 he was assassinated by John Felton, a disgruntled army officer who had served under him, as he prepared an expedition to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle. His son, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, was a notable advisor in the reign of Charles II, and, along with Lord Ashley made up the Protestant axis of the famous Cabal Ministry. He started the first foxhunt in England, The Bilsdale Hunt in 1668 and later started the Sinnington Hunt in 1680. After digging for a fox above Kirkbymoorside, and being too far from his home in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, he died from a chill in the house of a tenant. With his death in 1687, the title again became extinct. Several other members of the Villiers family have been elevated to the peerage. Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey, and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, were brothers of the first Duke of Buckingham. Also, Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey, was the great-nephew of the first Duke of Buckingham while Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon, was the second son of the second Earl of Jersey. =Dukes of Buckingham, third creation (1703)= John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby (1648‚Äì1721) The third creation of the dukedom, as Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, was in 1703 for John Sheffield, 3rd Earl of Mulgrave, 1st Marquess of Normanby, a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. The dukedom was created in the Peerage of England. The full title was Duke of the County of Buckingham and of Normanby but in practice only Duke of Buckingham and Normanby was used. The duke's family descended from Sir Edmund Sheffield, second cousin of Henry VIII, who in 1547 was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Sheffield and in 1549 was killed in the streets of Norwich during Kett's Rebellion. On the death of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1735, the titles became extinct. The Sheffield family estates passed to the 2nd Duke's half-brother Charles Herbert Sheffield, the illegitimate son of the 1st Duke by Frances Stewart. He was created a Baronet in 1755 and is the ancestor of the Sheffield Baronets, of Normanby. =Dukes of Buckingham, fourth creation (1822)= The 719 heraldic quarterings of the Dukes of Buckingham from the Temple-Nugent- Brydges-Chandos-Grenville family The fourth creation of the dukedom, as Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, was in 1822 for Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, a landowner and politician. He was the son of George Nugent Temple Grenville, 3rd Earl Temple, who was the son of Prime Minister George Grenville, and who had been created Marquess of Buckingham in the peerage of Great Britain in 1784. The 1st Marquess of Buckingham had married Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent. Mary was in 1800 created Baroness Nugent in her own right in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to her second son George (see the Baron Nugent). In 1788 Lord Buckingham also succeeded his father-in-law as second Earl Nugent according to a special remainder in the letters patent, and at the same time assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Nugent. After the 1st Marquess of Buckingham's death in 1813, his titles passed to his son Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham. He married Lady Anne Eliza Brydges, the only child of James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos (a title which became extinct on his death in 1789), and assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Brydges-Chandos in 1799. In 1822 Lord Buckingham was created Earl Temple of Stowe, in the County of Buckingham, Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The earldom was created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to (1) the heirs male of the body of his deceased great-grandmother Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple, and (2) in default thereof to his granddaughter Lady Anne Eliza Mary Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, daughter of his son Richard, who succeeded as second Duke in 1839. After the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos' death in 1861, the titles passed to his son, the third Duke. He was also a prominent politician and served as Lord President of the Council and as Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1868 the Duke established his right to the Scottish lordship of Kinloss before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. On his death in 1889 without male issue, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles (the marquessate of Buckingham, marquessate of Chandos, earldom of Temple and earldom of Nugent) became extinct. The lordship of Kinloss passed to his daughter Mary.

The theory uses an updated form of Kantian philosophy and a variant form of conventional social contract theory. Rawls's theory of justice is fully a political theory of justice as opposed to other forms of justice discussed in other disciplines and contexts. The resultant theory was challenged and refined several times in the decades following its original publication in 1971. A significant reappraisal was published in the 1985 essay \\"Justice as Fairness\\", and a subsequent book under the same title, within which Rawls further developed his two central principles for his discussion of justice. Together, they dictate that society should be structured so that the greatest possible amount of liberty is given to its members, limited only by the notion that the liberty of any one member shall not infringe upon that of any other member. Secondly, inequalities ‚Äì either social or economic ‚Äì are only to be allowed if the worst off will be better off than they might be under an equal distribution. Finally, if there is such a beneficial inequality, this inequality should not make it harder for those without resources to occupy positions of power ‚Äì for instance, public office. First published in 1971, A Theory of Justice was revised in 1975, while translated editions were being released in the 1990s it was further revised in 1999. In 2001, Rawls published a follow-up study titled Justice as Fairness: A Restatement. The original edition was reissued in 2005. Objective In A Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Principles of justice are sought to guide the conduct of the parties. These parties are recognized to face moderate scarcity, and they are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic. They have ends which they seek to advance, but prefer to advance them through cooperation with others on mutually acceptable terms. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts. The \\"original position\\" Rawls belongs to the social contract tradition, although he takes a different view from that of previous thinkers. Specifically, Rawls develops what he claims are principles of justice through the use of an artificial device he calls the Original position; in which, everyone decides principles of justice from behind a veil of ignorance. This \\"veil\\" is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage: : \\"...no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance.\\" According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the Original Position would all adopt a maximin strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off. : \\"They are the principles that rational and free persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamentals of the terms of their association.\\" (Rawls, p. 11) Rawls bases his Original Position on a \\"thin theory of the good\\" which he says \\"explains the rationality underlying choice of principles in the Original Position\\". A full theory of the good follows after we derive principles from the original position. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two such principles, which would then govern the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The difference principle permits inequalities in the distribution of goods only if those inequalities benefit the worst-off members of society. Rawls believes that this principle would be a rational choice for the representatives in the original position for the following reason: Each member of society has an equal claim on their society's goods. Natural attributes should not affect this claim, so the basic right of any individual, before further considerations are taken into account, must be to an equal share in material wealth. What, then, could justify unequal distribution? Rawls argues that inequality is acceptable only if it is to the advantage of those who are worst-off. The agreement that stems from the original position is both hypothetical and ahistorical. It is hypothetical in the sense that the principles to be derived are what the parties would, under certain legitimating conditions, agree to, not what they have agreed to. Rawls seeks to use an argument that the principles of justice are what would be agreed upon if people were in the hypothetical situation of the original position and that those principles have moral weight as a result of that. It is ahistorical in the sense that it is not supposed that the agreement has ever been, or indeed could ever have been, derived in the real world outside of carefully limited experimental exercises.  The principles of justice  Rawls modifies and develops the principles of justice throughout his book. In chapter forty- six, Rawls makes his final clarification on the two principles of justice: > 1\\\\. \\"Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total > system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty > for all\\". 2\\\\. \\"Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that > they are both: :(a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, > consistent with the just savings principle, and :(b) attached to offices and > positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\\" The first principle is often called the greatest equal liberty principle. Part (a) of the second principle is referred to as the difference principle while part (b) is referred to as the equal opportunity principle. Rawls orders the principles of justice lexically, as follows: 1, 2b, 2a. The greatest equal liberty principle takes priority, followed by the equal opportunity principle and finally the difference principle. The first principle must be satisfied before 2b, and 2b must be satisfied before 2a. As Rawls states: \\"A principle does not come into play until those previous to it are either fully met or do not apply.\\"Rawls, p. 38, revised edition. Therefore, the equal basic liberties protected in the first principle cannot be traded or sacrificed for greater social advantages (granted by 2(b)) or greater economic advantages (granted by 2a).Rawls, pp. 53‚Äì54, revised edition. = The greatest equal liberty principle = : \\"Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all\\" (1). The greatest equal liberty principle is mainly concerned with the distribution of rights and liberties. Rawl's identifies the following equal basic liberties: \\"political liberty (the right to vote and hold public office) and freedom of speech and assembly; liberty of conscience and freedom of thought; freedom of the person, which includes freedom from psychological oppression and physical assault and dismemberment (integrity of the person); the right to hold personal property and freedom from arbitrary arrest and seizure as defined by the concept of the rule of law.\\"Rawls, p. 53 revised edition; p. 60 in the 1971 first edition It is a matter of some debate whether freedom of contract can be inferred to be included among these basic liberties: \\"liberties not on the list, for example, the right to own certain kinds of property and freedom of contract as understood by the doctrine of laissez-faire are not basic; and so they are not protected by the priority of the first principle.\\"Rawls, p. 54 revised edition . = The difference principle = :Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle (2a). Rawls' claim in (a) is that departures from equality of a list of what he calls primary goods‚Äî\\"things which a rational man wants whatever else he wants\\" [Rawls, 1971, p. 92]‚Äîare justified only to the extent that they improve the lot of those who are worst-off under that distribution in comparison with the previous, equal, distribution. His position is at least in some sense egalitarian, with a provision that inequalities are allowed when they benefit the least advantaged. An important consequence of Rawls' view is that inequalities can actually be just, as long as they are to the benefit of the least well off. His argument for this position rests heavily on the claim that morally arbitrary factors (for example, the family one is born into) shouldn't determine one's life chances or opportunities. Rawls is also oriented to an intuition that a person does not morally deserve their inborn talents; thus that one is not entitled to all the benefits they could possibly receive from them; hence, at least one of the criteria which could provide an alternative to equality in assessing the justice of distributions is eliminated. Further, the just savings principle requires that some sort of material respect is left for future generations. Although Rawls is ambiguous about what this means, it can generally be understood as \\"a contribution to those coming later\\" [Rawls, 1971, p. 255]. = The equal opportunity principle = :Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity (2b). The stipulation in 2b is lexically prior to that in 2a. This is because equal opportunity requires not merely that offices and positions are distributed on the basis of merit, but that all have reasonable opportunity to acquire the skills on the basis of which merit is assessed, even if one might not have the necessary material resources - due to a beneficial inequality stemming from the difference principle. It may be thought that this stipulation, and even the first principle of justice, may require greater equality than the difference principle, because large social and economic inequalities, even when they are to the advantage of the worst-off, will tend to seriously undermine the value of the political liberties and any measures towards fair equality of opportunity. Influence and reception In 1972, A Theory of Justice was reviewed in The New York Times Book Review by Marshall Cohen, who described the work as \\"magisterial,\\" and suggested that Rawls' use of the techniques of analytic philosophy made the book the \\"most formidable\\" defense of the social contract tradition to date. He credited Rawls with showing that the widespread claim that \\"systematic moral and political philosophy are dead\\" is mistaken, and with providing a \\"bold and rigorous\\" account of \\"the principles to which our public life is committed.\\" Though he suggested that it might take years before a satisfactory appraisal of the work could be made, he noted that Rawls' accomplishments had been compared by scholars to those of John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant. However, he criticized Rawls for \\"looseness in his understanding of some fundamental political concepts.\\" A Theory of Justice received criticism from several philosophers. Robert Nozick criticized Rawls' account of distributive justice in his defense of libertarianism, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974). Allan Bloom, writing in American Political Science Review in 1975, noted that A Theory of Justice had \\"attracted more attention in the Anglo-Saxon world than any work of its kind in a generation\\", attributing its popularity to its being \\"the most ambitious political project undertaken by a member of the school currently dominant in academic philosophy\\" and to Rawls' \\"radical egalitarian interpretation of liberal democracy.\\" Bloom criticized Rawls for failing to account for the existence of natural right in his theory of justice and wrote that Rawls absolutizes social union as the ultimate goal which would conventionalize everything into artifice. Robert Paul Wolff criticized Rawls from a Marxist perspective in Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice (1977), arguing Rawls offers an apology for the status quo insofar as he constructs justice from existing practice and forecloses the possibility that there may be problems of injustice embedded in capitalist social relations, private property or the market economy. Michael Sandel criticized Rawls in Liberalism and the Limits of Justice (1982), arguing that Rawls encourages people to think about justice while divorced from the values and aspirations that define who they are as persons and that allow people to determine what justice is. Susan Moller Okin wrote in Justice, Gender, and the Family (1989) that Rawls had provided \\"the most influential of all twentieth- century theories of justice\\", but criticized him for failing to account for the injustices and hierarchies embedded in familial relations. Economists Kenneth Arrow and John Harsanyi criticized the assumptions of the original position, and in particular, the use of maximin reasoning, with the implication that Rawls' selection of parameters for the original position was result-oriented, i.e., calculated to derive the two principles that Rawls desired to advance, and/or, as the \\"contractarian critique\\" holds, that the persons in the original position articulated by Rawls would not in fact select the principles that A Theory of Justice advocates.Arrow, \\"Some Ordinalist- Utilitarian Notes on Rawls' Theory of Justice, Journal of Philosophy 70, 9 (May 1973), pp. 245‚Äì63.Harsanyi, \\"Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality? a Critique of John Rawls' Theory, American Political Science Review 69, 2 (June 1975), pp. 594‚Äì606. In reply Rawls emphasized the role of the original position as a \\"device of representation\\" for making sense of the idea of a fair choice situation for free and equal citizens, and that the relatively modest role that maximin plays in his argument: it is \\"a useful heuristic rule of thumb\\" given the curious features of choice behind the veil of ignorance.Rawls, Justice as Fairness: a Restatement, p. 97. The economist Amartya Sen has raised concerns over Rawls' emphasis on primary social goods, arguing in Inequality Reexamined (1992) that we should attend not only to the distribution of primary goods, but also how effectively people are able to use those goods to pursue their ends.Sen, Inequality Reexamined (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992). Norman Daniels has wondered why health care shouldn't be treated as a primary good,Daniels, \\"Rights to Health Care: Programmatic Worries,\\" Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 4, 2 (1979): pp. 174‚Äì91. and some of his subsequent work has addressed this question, arguing for a right to health care within a broadly Rawlsian framework.Daniels, Just Health Care (Cambridge University Press, 1985). The philosopher G. A. Cohen, in If You're An Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich? (2000) and Rescuing Justice and Equality (2008), criticizes Rawls' avowal of inequality under the difference principle, his application of the principle only to social institutions, and what he sees as Rawls's obsession with using primary goods as his currency of equality.Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000. Sen critiques and attempts to revitalize A Theory of Justice in The Idea of Justice (2009). He credits Rawls for revitalizing the interest in the ideas of what justice means and the stress put on fairness, objectivity, equality of opportunity, removal of poverty, and freedom. However, Sen, as part of his general critique of the contractarian tradition, states that ideas about a perfectly just world do not help redress actual existing inequality. Sen faults Rawls for an over-emphasis on institutions as guarantors of justice not considering the effects of human behaviour on the institutions' ability to maintain a just society. Sen believes Rawls understates the difficulty in getting everyone in society to adhere to the norms of a just society. He also claims that Rawls' position that there be only one possible outcome of the reflective equilibrium behind the veil of ignorance is misguided. In contrast to Rawls, Sen believes that multiple conflicting, yet just principles may arise and that this undermines the multi-step processes that Rawls laid out as leading to a perfectly just society. In popular culture A Theory of Justice inspired a 2013 musical, A Theory of Justice: The Musical!, written and produced by Eylon Aslan-Levy, Ramin Sabi, Tommy Peto, and Toby Huelin.

Skippered by John Bertrand, she was the first successful Cup challenger, ending a 132-year tenure (with 26 successful defences) by the New York Yacht Club. Design Australia II was designed by Ben Lexcen, built by Steve Ward, owned by Alan Bond and skippered by John Bertrand. Lexcen's Australia II design featured a reduced waterline length and a short chord winged keel which gave the boat a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and heeling moment (lower ballast center of gravity) but it was a significant disadvantage in choppy seas. The boat was also very quick in stays. The winged keel was a major design advance, and its legality was questioned by the New York Yacht Club. During the summer of 1983, as selection trials took place for the Cup defence that autumn, the New York Yacht Club challenged the legality of the keel design. The controversy was decided in Australia IIs favour. Australia II sported a number of other innovative features that contributed to her success, including radical vertical sail designs, all-kevlar running rigging and a lightweight carbon fibre boom. Winged keel of Australia II =Later claims of Dutch design= In 2009, Dutch naval architect Peter van Oossanen claimed that the winged keel was actually designed by him and his group of Dutch designers, and not Ben Lexcen. If true, this would have been reason to disqualify Australia II, since the rules state that the yacht is to be designed by citizens of the nation it represents. The controversy arose due to cup rules allowing designers to use model basins for testing that are not located in the challenging country. Model testing was performed in the Netherlands and Peter van Oossanen and another Dutch engineer, Joop Sloof, performed measurements and analyses related to evaluation of winged keel designs. The suggestion that the vessel was not designed by Australians has been refuted by both John Bertrand and project manager John Longley. Furthermore, it is well established that Lexcen had been experimenting with wing adaptations to the undersurface appendages of boats before, including his 1958 skiffs Taipan and Venom, although in the latter application they were not determined to be effective and not further adopted. In 1983 Lexcen commented on the controversy: \\"I have in mind to admit it all to the New York Yacht Club that I really owe the secret of the design to a Greek guy who helped me out and was invaluable. He's been dead for 2000 years. Bloody Archimedes...\\" Competitions =Louis Vuitton Cup= Australia II dominated the 1983 Louis Vuitton Cup before defeating Azzurra in the semi finals and Victory 83 in the final to win the trophy and earn the right to challenge for the America's Cup. =America's Cup= Australia II, bearing sail number KA6, represented the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia in its September 1983 challenge for the America's Cup. The defender, the New York Yacht Club, had held the cup since 1851, dominating challengers and sustaining the longest winning streak in sport. Australia II, skippered by John Bertrand, faced Dennis Conner sailing the 12-metre Liberty in the ocean off Newport, Rhode Island. Australia II came from behind to prevail 4 races to 3. The victory on 26 September 1983 was a landmark event for the nation of Australia, not to mention the Royal Perth Yacht Club. The achievement was underscored when Australia II was awarded the ABC Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1983. The crew of Australia II for the America's Cup races was John Bertrand (skipper), Will Baillieu, Colin Beashel, Rob Brown , Peter Costello, Damian Fewster, James Hardy (alternate helm), Ken Judge, Skip Lissiman, John Longley, Scott McAllister, Brian Richardson, Phil Smidmore, Grant Simmer, and Hugh Treharne. Beashel was an Olympic medal winning sailor who competed at six Olympic games. Richardson was an dual-Olympian oarsman who had stroked the Australian men's eight at the Moscow 1980 Olympics. Popular culture The Boxing Kangaroo was the official mascot of the Australia II effort. The win was received with much enthusiasm in Australia, with the Men at Work song \\"Down Under\\" becoming the official anthem for the crew. Retirement In the mid-1980s, Australia II was sold by Alan Bond to the Australian government. She was lent to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney for display in 1991. In 2000, Australia II was removed from the National Maritime Museum and transferred to the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle. For the 150th anniversary celebrations of the America's Cup in 2001, she was removed from the museum and shipped to the Isle of Wight, sailing with the original crew for several days of commemorative regattas. Australia II was returned to the Western Australian Maritime Museum, where she is on permanent display. In 2017, the Team of Australia II were among the inaugural inductees to the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame. References Further reading *Schmitt, Hugh.

Film criticism Bazin started to write about film in 1943 and was a co-founder of the renowned film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma in 1951, along with Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca. Bazin was a major force in post-World War II film studies and criticism. He edited Cahiers until his death, and a four-volume collection of his writings was published posthumously, covering the years 1958 to 1962 and titled Qu'est- ce que le cin√©ma? (What is cinema?). A selection from this collection was translated into English and published in two volumes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They became mainstays of film courses in the English-speaking world, but never were updated or revised. In 2009, the Canadian publisher Caboose, taking advantage of more favourable Canadian copyright laws, compiled fresh translations of some of the key essays from the collection in a single- volume edition. With annotations by translator Timothy Barnard, this became the only corrected and annotated edition of these writings in any language. In 2018, this volume was replaced by a more extensive collection of Bazin's texts translated by Barnard, Andr√© Bazin: Selected Writings 1943-1958.

He advocated the use of deep focus (Orson Welles),Bazin Andre What Is Cinema Volume 1 (pg.33): Internet Archive wide shots (Jean Renoir) and the \\"shot-in-depth\\", and preferred what he referred to as \\"true continuity\\" through mise-en-sc√®ne over experiments in editing and visual effects.

Its lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published first by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in Magasin des enfants (Children's Collection) and by Andrew Lang in the Blue Fairy Book of his Fairy Book series in 1889, to produce the version(s) most commonly retold. It was influenced by some earlier Ancient Greek stories, such as \\"Cupid and Psyche\\", The Golden Ass written by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis in the 2nd century AD, and The Pig King, an Italian fairytale published by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola around 1550.Harrison, \\"Cupid and Psyche\\", Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome',' p. 339. Variants of the tale are known across Europe.Heidi Anne Heiner, \\"Tales Similar to Beauty and the Beast\\" In France, for example, Z√©mire and Azor is an operatic version of the story, written by Marmontel and composed by Gr√©try in 1771, which had enormous success well into the 19th century;Thomas, Downing. Aesthetics of Opera in the Ancien R√©gime, 1647‚Äì1785. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002. it is based on the second version of the tale. Amour pour amour (Love for love), by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chauss√©e, a 1742 play based on de Villeneuve's version. According to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated around 4,000 years ago. Plot = Villeneuve's version = Illustration for Beauty and the Beast drawn by Walter Crane. A widower merchant lives in a mansion with his twelve children (six sons and six daughters). All three of his daughters are very beautiful, but the youngest, Beauty, is the most lovely, as well as kind, well-read, and pure of heart; while the two elder sisters, in contrast, are cruel, selfish, vain, and spoiled. On a dark and stormy night at sea, all of his wealth was robbed by pirates, who sink most of his merchant fleet, and forces the entire family to live in a small barn to work for a living. While Beauty makes a firm resolution to adjust to rural life with a cheerful disposition, her sisters do not and mistake her firmness for insensibility, forcing her into doing household work in an effort to make enough money to buy back their former home. A year later, the merchant hears from one of his crewmembers that one of the trade ships he had sent has arrived back in port, having escaped the destruction of its companions. Before leaving, he asks his children if they wish for him to bring any gifts back for them. The sons ask for weaponry and horses to hunt with, whereas the oldest daughters ask for clothing, jewels, and the finest dresses possible as they think his wealth has returned. Beauty asks for nothing but her father to be safe, but when he insists on buying her a present, she is satisfied with the promise of a rose after none of those grew last spring. However, to his dismay, the merchant finds that his ship's cargo has been seized to pay his debts, leaving him penniless and unable to buy his children's presents. On his way back, the merchant becomes caught in a terrible storm. Desperately seeking shelter, he comes upon a mysterious palace. Seeing that no one is home, the merchant sneaks in and finds tables inside laden with food and drinks, which seem to have been left for him by the palace's invisible owner. The merchant accepts this gift and spends the night there. The next morning, the merchant has come to view the palace as his own possession and is about to leave when he sees a rose garden and recalls that Beauty had desired a rose. Without warning, the merchant quickly plucked the loveliest rose he can find, and was about to pluck more to create a bouquet, only to end up being confronted by a hideous \\"Beast\\" who warns him that theft of his property, i.e. a rose (after accepting his hospitality), is a charge punishable by death. Realizing his deadly mistake, the merchant begs for forgiveness, revealing that he had only picked the rose as a gift for his youngest daughter. After listening to his story, the Beast reluctantly agrees to let him give the rose to Beauty, but only if the merchant brings Beauty to him in exchange without deception; he makes it clear that Beauty must agree to take his place to the point where he will then treat her as his fianc√©e, and not his prisoner, while under no illusions about her predicament. Otherwise, the Beast will threateningly destroy his entire family. At first, the merchant is hesitantly upset about Beauty being abducted into marrying him, but he reluctantly accepts this condition. The Beast sends him on his way atop a magical horse, along with wealth, jewels and fine clothes for his sons and daughters, but stresses that Beauty must never know about his deal. The merchant, upon arriving home, tries to hide the secret from his children, but Beauty pries it from him on purpose. Reacting swiftly, the brothers suggest if they could go to the castle and fight the Beast together, while the older sisters place blame on Beauty for dooming the entire family. The merchant dissuades his children, forbidding them from ever going near the Beast. Eventually, Beauty sneaks away from home later that night against her father's orders to face the Beast alone. Anne Anderson. Once she arrives at his palace, the Beast becomes excited to meet her face to face, so he throws a welcome ceremony by treating her to an amazing cabaret show. He gives her lavish clothing and food and carries on lengthy conversations with her and she notes that he is inclined to stupidity rather than savagery. Every night, the Beast asks Beauty to sleep with him, only to be refused each time. After each refusal, Beauty dreams of a handsome \\"Prince\\" whom she dances with. Suddenly, a fairy appears and pleads with Beauty to answer why she keeps refusing him, to which she replies that she doesn't know how to love the Beast because she loves him only as a friend and not a seducer. Despite the apparition of the fairy urging her not to be deceived by appearances, she does not make the connection between a \\"prince\\" and a \\"beast\\" and becomes convinced that the Beast is holding the Prince captive somewhere in his castle. She searches and discovers many enchanted rooms containing sources of entertainment ranging from libraries to aviaries to enchanted windows allowing her to attend the theater. She also comes across many live furniture and other live objects which act as servants, but never the Prince from her dreams. Throughout an entire month, Beauty lives a life of luxury at the Beast's palace, having every whim catered to, with no end of riches to amuse her and an endless supply of exquisite finery to wear. Eventually, she becomes homesick and begs the Beast to allow her to go see her family again. He allows it on the condition that she returns in exactly one week. Beauty agrees to this and is presented with an enchanted ring which allows her to wake up in her family's new home in an instant when turned three times around her finger. The rest of her family is surprised to find her well fed and dressed in finery. Beauty tries to share the magnificent gowns and jewels the Beast gave her with her older sisters, but they turn into rags at her sisters' touch, and are restored to their splendor when returned to Beauty, as the Beast meant them only for her. Her sisters are envious when they hear of her happy life at the castle, and, overhearing that she must return to the Beast on a certain day, try to persuade her to steer clear of the Beast, even her father threatens to disown Beauty if she refuses to marry his younger and wealthier cousin next week, a wedding which was arranged for his youngest daughter instead, snatching the ring away from her to prevent her from going back to the Beast's castle. When she then pleads for the marriage with the merchant's cousin to be delayed, her brothers reject her, believing she knows too much about the Beast. Beauty is now shaken by her family's overprotection, and she reluctantly agrees to make it official, even if she stays with her family a lot longer. Illustration by Warwick Goble. A week has passed and she begins hallucinating about the Beast lying dead in his quarters back at his castle and hastens to return; she immediately steals back the ring from her father and uses it to return to the Beast. Once she is back in the castle, Beauty's fears are confirmed as she finds the Beast murdered in cold blood at the hands of an angry mob sent by her father in an effort to keep his children, even Beauty, away from him. Now completely devastated over her sins, Beauty bursts into tears and laments that she should have learned how to love the Beast in the first place, screaming \\"I am sorry! This was all my fault!\\". Suddenly, when she says those magic words, the Beast is transformed into the handsome prince from Beauty's dreams. The Prince informs her that long ago, a powerful witch turned him into a hideous beast for his selfishness after trying to seduce him and that only by finding true love, despite his ugliness, could the curse be broken. He and Beauty are married and they live happily ever after together. =Beaumont's version= Beaumont greatly pared down the cast of characters and simplified the tale to an almost archetypal simplicity.Betsy Hearne, Beauty and the Beast: Visions and Revisions of An Old Tale, p 25 The story begins in much the same way, although now the merchant has only six children: three sons and three daughters of which Beauty is one. The circumstances leading to her arrival at the Beast's castle unfolds in a similar manner and on this arrival she is informed that she is mistress there and he will obey her. Beaumont strips most of the detail and lavish descriptions present on Beauty's exploration of the palace in Villeneuve's versions and quickly jumps to her return home. She is given leave to remain there for a week and when she arrives her sisters plot to feign fondness for her to entice her to remain another week in hopes that the Beast will devour her in his anger. Again, she returns to him dying and restores him to life. They then marry and live happily ever after and this ends Beaumont's tale as she omits the background information given on both the Prince and his family and Beauty and hers. Variants The tale has become one of the most popular in oral tradition. =Europe= France Emmanuel Cosquin collected a version with a tragic ending from Lorraine, in northeastern France, titled The White Wolf (Le Loup blanc) in which the youngest daughter asks her father to bring her a singing rose when he returns. Because the man cannot find a singing rose for his youngest daughter he refuses to return home until he finds one. When he finally finds singing roses, is in the castle of the titular white wolf, who initially wants to kill him for daring to steal his roses, but when he hears about his daughters he changes his mind and agrees to spare him his life, with the condition he must give him the first living being that greets him when he returns home, who turns out to be his youngest daughter. In the castle the girl discovers the white wolf is enchanted and can turn into a human at night, but she must not tell anyone about it. Unfortunately the girl is later visited by her two elder sisters, who pressure her to tell them what is happening. After she finally does it, the castle crumbles and the wolf dies.Cosquin, Emmanuel Contes populaires de Lorraine Tome II. Deuxi√©me Tirage. Paris: Vieweg 1887 pp. 215-217 Henri Pourrat collected a version from Auvergne, in south-central France, titled Belle Rose (sometimes translated in English as Lovely Rose). In this version the heroine and her sisters are the daughters of a poor peasant and named after flowers, with the protagonist being called Rose and her sisters Marguerite (Daisy) and Julianne respectively. The Beast is described having a mastiff jaw, lizard legs and a salamander's body. The ending is closer to Villeneuve's and Beaumont's versions, with Rose rushing back to the beast castle and finds the Beast lying besides a fountain, dying. When the Beast asks her if she knows that he can't live without her Rose answers yes, and the Beast turn back into a human, explaining to Rose that he was a prince cursed for mocking a beggar, who could only be disenchanted by a poor but kind-hearted maiden. Unlike in Beaumont's version it is not mentioned that the protagonist's sisters are punished at the end.Pourrat, Henri French Folktales New York: Pantheon Books 1989 pp. 447-456 Italy The tale is surprisingly popular in the Italian oral tradition. Christian Schneller collected a variant from Trentino titled The Singing, Dancing and Music-making Leaf (German: Vom singenden, tanzenden und musicirenden Blatte Italian: La foglia, che canta, che balla e che suona) in which the Beast takes the form of a snake. Instead of going to visit her family alone the heroine can only go to her sister's wedding if she agrees to let the snake go with her. During the wedding they dance together, and when the girl kicks the snake's tail it turns into a beautiful youth, who's the son of a count.Schneller, Christian M√§rchen und Sagen aus W√§lschtirol Innsbruck: Wagner 1867 pp. 63-65. Sicilian folklorist Giuseppe Pitr√® collected a variant from Palermo titled Rusina 'Mperatrici (The Empress Rosina).Pitr√®, Giuseppe Fiabe, novelle e racconti popolari siciliane Volume Primo. Palermo: Luigi Pedone Lauriel 1875 pp. 350-356 Domenico Comparetti included a variant from Montale titled Bellindia, in which Bellindia is the heroine's name, while her two eldest sisters are called Carolina and Assunta.Comparetti, Domenico Novelline popolari italiane Roma: Ermanno Loescher 1875 pp. 274-280 Vittorio Imbriani included a version titled Zelinda and the Monster (Zelinda e il Mostro), in which the heroine, called Zelinda, asks for a rose in January. Instead of going to visit her family, staying longer than she promised and then returning to the Monster's castle to find him dying on the ground, here the Monster shows Zelinda her father dying on a magic mirror and says the only way she can save him is saying that she loves him. Zelinda does as aid, and the Monster turns into a human, who tells her he is the son of the King of the Oranges.Imbriani, Vittorio La Novellaja Fiorentina Livorno: Coi tipi di F. Vigo 1877 pp. 319-327 Both Comparetti's and Imbriani's versions were included in Sessanta novelle popolari montalesi by Gherardo Nerucci. British folklorist Rachel Harriette Busk collected a version from Rome titled The Enchanted Rose- Tree where the heroine does not have any sisters.Busk, Rachel Harriette The Folk-lore of Rome: collected by Worth of Mouth from People London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1874 pp. 115-118 Antonio De Nino collected a variant from Abruzzo, in eastern Italy, that he also titled Bellindia, in which instead of a rose the heroine asks for a golden carnation. Instead of a seeing it on a magic mirror, or knowing about it because the Beast tells her, here Bellinda knows what happens in her father's house because in the garden there is a tree called the Tree of Weeping and Laughter, whose leaves turn upwards when there is joy in her family, and they drop when there is sorrow.De Nino, Antonio Usi e costumi abruzzesi Volume Terzo. Firenze: Tipografia di G. Barb√®ra 1883 pp. 161-166 Francesco Mango collected a Sardianian version titled The Bear and the Three Sisters (S'urzu i is tres sorris), in which the Beast has the form of a bear.Mango, Francesco Novelline popolari sarde Palermo: Carlo Clausen 1885 pp. 39-41 Italo Calvino included a version on Italian Folktales titled Bellinda and the Monster, inspired mostly from Comparetti's version, but adding some elements from De Nino's, like the Tree of Weeping and Laughter. Iberian Peninsula Manuel Mil√° y Fontanals collected an interesting version titled The King's Son, Disenchanted (El hijo del rey, desencantado). In that one when the father asks his three daughters what they want him to bring them the youngest asks for the hand of the king's son in marriage, and everybody thinks she's haughty for wanting such thing. The father orders his servants to kill her, but they spare him and she hides in the woods, where she meets a wolf that brings her to a castle, where they lived together. To break the spell the girl must kill the wolf and throw the body into the fire after opening it. From the body comes out a pigeon, and from the pigeon an egg. When the girl breaks the egg, the king's son comes out.Mil√° y Fontanals Observaciones sobre la poes√≠a popular Barcelona: Imprenta de Narciso Ramirez 1853 pp. 185-186 Francisco Maspons y Labr√≥s extended and translated the tale to Catalan, and included it in the second volume of Lo Rondallayre.Maspons y Labr√≥s, Francisco Lo Rondallayre: Quentos Populars Catalans Vol. II Barcelona: Llibrer√≠a de √Ålvar Verdaguer 1871 pp. 104-110 Maspons y Labr√≥s also collected another variant from Catalonia, titled Lo trist. Instead of roses or any other kind of flowers here the youngest daughter asks for a coral necklace. Every time one of her family members is sick the heroine is warned by elements from the garden like a spring with muddy waters or a tree with withered leaves. When she goes to visit her family, she must return with the beast every time she hears a bell ringing. After her third visit to her family, the heroine returns to the garden where she finds her favorite rosebush withered. When she plucks a rose the beast appears, turning into a beautiful youth.Maspons y Labr√≥s, Francisco Lo Rondallayre: Quentos Populars Catalans Vol. I Barcelona: Llibrer√≠a de √Ålvar Verdaguer 1871 pp. 103-106 A version from Extremadura collected by Sergio Hern√°ndez de Soto titled The Bear Prince (El pr√≠ncipe oso) starts similar to Beaumont's and Villeneuve's versions, with the heroine's father losing his fortune after a shipwreck. When he has the chance to recover his wealth, the father asks his daughters what they want him to bring home from his travel, and the heroine asks for a lily instead of a rose. When the merchant finally finds a lily a bear appears, saying that the merchant's youngest daughter must come to the garden, because she's the only one who can repair the damage the merchant has caused. The youngest daughter goes and finds the bear lying on the ground, wounded. The only way to heal him is restoring the lily the father took, and when the girl restores it the bear is turned into a prince.Hern√°ndez de Soto, Sergio Biblioteca de las Tradiciones Populares Espa√±olas Madrid: Librer√≠a de Fernando F√© 1886 pp. 118-121 The tale was translated to English by Elsie Spicer Eells and retitled The Lily and the Bear.Eells, Elsie Spicer Tales of Enchantment from Spain New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company 1920 p. 109 Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Sr. collected a version from Almenar de Soria titled The Beast of the Rose Bush (La fiera del rosal), in which the heroine is the daughter of a king instead of a merchant.Espinosa, Aurelio Macedonio Cuentos Populares Espa√±oles Standford University Press 1924 pp. 271-273 Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Jr. published a version from Sep√∫lveda, Segovia titled The Beast of the Garden (La fiera del jard√≠n). In this version the heroine has a stepmother and two stepsisters, and asks for an unspecified white flower.Espinosa, Aurelio Macedonio Cuentos populares de Castilla y Le√≥n Volumen 1 Madrid: CSIC 1987 pp. 240-243 In a Portuguese version collected by Z√≥fimo Consiglieri Pedroso, the heroine asks for a slice of roach off a green meadow, after her father insists she must ask for something too like her elder sisters did. The father finally finds a slice of roack off a green meadow in a castle where he doesn't see anyone living there, but hears a voice saying he must bring his youngest daughter to the palace. Instead of a magic mirror the heroine knows what happens in her father's house every time she asks the voice why a bird she hears sing. She visits her family three times, the first two because her sisters are getting married, and the third because her father is dying. To know when she must return to the castle a horse is sent, and the heroine must go after hearing him three times. The third time she goes to visit her family her father dies, and after the funeral she's so tired that she oversleeps, so she doesn't hear the horse arriving, neighing three times and leaving. When she finally returns to the castle she finds the beast dying, and with his last breath he curses her and her entire family. The heroine dies a few days after, and her sisters spent the rest of their lives in poverty.Pedroso, Consiglieri Portuguese Folk- Tales New York: Folklore Society Publications 1882 pp. 41-45 Another Portuguese version from Ourilhe, collected by Francisco Adolfo Coelho and titled A Bella-menina, is closer to Beaumont's tale, with a happy ending in which the beast is revived and disenchanted.Coelho, Adolfo Contos Populares Portuguezes Lisboa: P. Plantier 1879 pp. 69-71 Belgium and the Netherlands In a Flemish version from Veurne titled Rose without Thorns (Roosken zonder Doornen) the way the prince is disenchanted is quite different to Beaumont's and Villeneuve's versions. The heroine and the monster go to each of the weddings of the heroine's elder sisters, and to break the spell the heroine has to give a toast for the beast. In the first wedding the heroine forgets to do it, but in the second she remembers it, and the beast turns into a human.Wolf, Johann Wilhelm Grootmoederken, Archiven voor Nederduitsche Sagen, Sprookjes, Volksliederen, Volksfeesten en Volksgebruiken Gent: Boek en Steendrukkery van C. Annoot-Braeckman 1842 pp. 61-66 Another Flemish version from Wuustwezel collected by Victor de Meyere is closer to Beaumont's plot, with the merchant's youngest daughter staying one day more at her family's home, and soon after returning to the Beast's palace when she fears something bad must have happened to him. This one is one of the few versions where the merchant accompanies her daughter in her return to the Beast's castle.De Meyere, Victor De Vlaamsche vertelselschat Deel 2 Antwerpen: De Sikkel 1927 pp. 139.147 Even closer to Beaumont's plot is a Dutch version from Driebergen titled Rozina.Meder, Theo De magische Vlucht Amsterdan: Bert Bakker 2000 pp. 54-65Meder, Theo The Flying Dutchman and Other Folktales from the Netherlands Westport and London: Libraries Unlimited 2008 pp. 29-37 Germany and Central Europe The brothers Grimm originally collected a variant of the story. Titled The Summer and Winter Garden (Von dem Sommer- und Wintergarten):Grimm, Jacob, Wilhelm Grimm, JACK ZIPES, and ANDREA DEZS√ñ. \\"THE SUMMER AND THE WINTER GARDEN.\\" In: The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: The Complete First Edition. pp. 225-27.

After making the deal with the beast the father does not tell anything to her daughters, so eight days later the beast appears in the merchant's house and takes the youngest daughter away. Here when the heroine's return is not enough to heal her sick father, who dies. The merchant's daughter stays longer because of her father's funeral, and when she finally returns she finds the beast lying underneath a heap of cabbages heads. After reviving him pouring water, the beast turns into a handsome prince.Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen Berlin: Realschulbuchhandlung 1812 pp. 323-328 The tale appeared in their collection's first edition, in 1812, but because they judged the tale too similar to its French counterpart they omitted it in the next editions. Despite that several other folklorists collected variants from German speaking territories. Ludwig Bechstein published two versions. In the first one, Little Broomstick (Besenstielchen), the heroine, called here Nettchen, has a best friend who's called Little Broomstick because her father's broommaker. Like in The Summer and Winter Garden Nettchen asks for roses in the middle of winter, that her father can only found in the Beast's garden. When a carriage comes to bring Nettchen to the Beast's castle Nettchen's father sends intead Little Broomstick pretending to be Nettchen. Despite that the Beast discovers the scheme, sends Little Broomstick back home and Nettchen has to go to the Beast's castle. Here the prince's disenchantment happens before Nettchen's visit to her family, to cure her father using the sap of a plant from the prince's garden. Jealous of their youngest sister's fortune Nettchen's sisters kill her drowning her on the bath, but Nettchen is revived by the same sorceress that cursed the prince. Because Nettchen's eldest sisters are too dangerous, but Nettchen doesn't want them dead, the sorceress turns them into stone statues.Bechstein, Ludwig Deutsches M√§rchenbuch Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand 1847 pp. 228-232 In the second, The Little Nut Twig (Das Nu√üzweiglein) the heroine asks for the titular twig. When the father finally finds it he has to make a deal with a bear, promising him the first creature that he meets when he arrives at home, that turns out to be his youngest daughter. Like in Little Broomstick the merchant tries to deceive the bear sending another girl pretending to be his daughter, but the bear discovers it and the merchant's daughter has to go with the bear. After crossing together twelve rooms full of disgusting creatures the bear turns into a prince.Bechstein, Ludwig Deutsches M√§rchenbuch Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand 1847 pp. 81-85Bechstein, Ludwig The Old Story-teller: Popular German Tales London: Addey & Co. 1854 pp. 17-22 Carl and Theodor Colshorn collected two versions from Hannover. In the first one, The Clinking Clanking Lowesleaf (Vom klinkesklanken L√∂wesblatt), the heroine is the daughter of a king instead of a merchant. She asks for the titular leaf, that the king only gets after making a deal with a black poodle, promising to give him in a year and a day the first that greets him when he arrives home. Turning out to be the king's youngest daughter, like in Bechstein's version they tried to trick the poodle giving him other girls pretending to be the princess, but the poddle always discovers the mischief. Finally the princess goes with the poodle, who brings her to a cabin in the middle of the woods, where the princess feels so alone that the princess wishes for company, even if it was an old beggar woman. In that same instant an old beggar woman appears, and she tells the princess how to break the spell in exchange for inviting her to the princess' wedding. The princess keeps her promise, and her mother and sisters, who expressed disgust at the sight of the old beggar woman, become crooked and lame.Colshorn, Carl and Theodor M√§rchen und Sagen aus Hannover Hannover: Verlag von Carl Ruempler 1854 pp. 64-69 In the second, The Cursed Frog (Der verwunschene Frosch), the heroine is a merchant's daughter like in Beaumont's and Villeneuve's versions. The enchanted prince has the form of a frog, and she asks for a three-colored rose.Colshorn, Carl and Theodor M√§rchen und Sagen aus Hannover Hannover: Verlag von Carl Ruempler 1854 pp. 139-141Zipes, Jack The Golden Age of Folk and Fairy Tales: From the Brothers Grimm to Andrew Lang Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company 2013 pp. 215-217 Ernst Meier collected a version from Swabia, in southwestern Germany, in which the heroine has only one sister instead of two.Meier, Ernst Deutsche Volksm√§rchen aus Schwaben Stuttgart: C.P. Scheitlin 1852 pp. 202-204 Ignaz and Josef Zingerle collected an Austrian variant from Tannheim titled The Bear (Der B√§r) in which, unlike in mosts versions, the heroine is the eldest of the merchant's three daughters instead of the youngest. Like in The Summer and Winter Garden and Little Broomstick the protagonist asks for a rose in the middle of winter.Zingerle, Ignaz und Josef Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen aus S√ºddeutschland Regensburg 1854 pp. 310-313 Like in Zingerle's version the Beast has the form of a bear in the Swiss variant The Bear Prince (Der B√§renprinz), collected by Otto Sutermeister. Instead of flowers the youngest daughter asks for grapes.Sutermeister, Otto Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen aus der Schweiz Aarau: H.R. Sauerl√§nder 1869 pp. 75-78 Scandinavia Evald Tang Kristensen collected a Danish version that follows Beaumont's version pretty close. The most significant difference is that the enchanted prince has the form of a horse.Tang Kristensen, Evald √Üventyr fra Jylland Vol. I. Kjobehavn: Trykt hos Konrad Jorgensen i Kolding 1884 pp. 335-340 In a version from the Faroe Islands the youngest daughter asks for an apple instead of a rose.Jakobsen, Jakob F√¶r√∏ske folkesagn og √¶ventyr K√∏benhavn: S.

Beauty and the Beast is interesting as it bridges this gap, with Villeneuve's version being written as a salon tale for adults and Beaumont's being written as a didactic tale for children. Commentary Painting of Petrus Gonsalvus (c. 1580) Tatar (2017) compares the tale to the theme of \\"animal brides and grooms\\" found in folklore throughout the world, pointing out that the French tale was specifically intended for the preparation of young girls in 18th century France for arranged marriages. \\"Maria Tatar points [...] the story of Beauty and the Beast was meant for girls who would likely have their marriages arranged\\". The urban opening is unusual in fairy tales, as is the social class of the characters, neither royal nor peasants; it may reflect the social changes occurring at the time of its first writing.Maria Tatar, p 45, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, Hamburger (2015) points out that the design of the Beast in the 1946 film adaptation by Jean Cocteau was inspired by the portrait of Petrus Gonsalvus, a native of Tenerife who suffered from hypertrichosis, causing an abnormal growth of hair on his face and other parts, and who came under the protection of the French king and married a beautiful Parisian woman named Catherine.Andreas Hamburger in: Andreas Hamburger (ed.)

The ad campaign was created by New York-based advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. The Puttermans were a family of plastic robots who outlasted others, thanks to their Duracell brand batteries (a playful reference to their deadpan 1970s ad campaign which featured head-to-head competition between toys). The campaign was made to combat the successful Energizer Bunny ad campaign. The original campaign was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, whereas later executions (using the \\"No battery is stronger, longer\\" claim) were helmed by David Kellogg.Debi Derryberry's resum√© The characters were developed by special effects guru Steve Johnson and his company XFX, Inc. The actors were made up to look as if they were claymation or computer animation characters. The costumes consisted of boxy modular units of stiff foam rubber coated with urethane. The characters all had large copper-top batteries protruding from their backs and their faces were made of state-of-the-art latex prosthetics designed to heavily caricature the actors' own features, and complete character wardrobes. They tended to creep out viewers, due to their non-human yet non-toy nor cartoon appearance, and the series of commercials was abandoned. At the time, the actor identities were not revealed to preserve the family's mystique. The family consisted of: * Herb, the father (Keith Langsdale) * Flo, his wife, the mother (Marla Frees) * Son, Zack (Debi Derryberry) * Daughter, Trish (Krystee Clark)\\"DURACELL campaign as Trish Putterman\\" photograph, on Krystee Clark's Flickr account.IMDb page for Krystee Clark * Grandma Putterman, who was actually played by a male actor (K.W.

A talkative relative freezes up mid-sentence and falls face first into a plate of tuna or chicken alfredo, and Flo jokingly accuses Herb of switching her Duracell battery with an off-brand. * Trish Putterman and boyfriend Bruce sit on a porch swing, and wish that their romantic night could go on forever with the help of Duracell. * Grandma Putterman is so filled with energy, she can't stop dancing. * The Putterman family go on a camping trip and find that their flashlights still work with the help of Duracell. * Herb answers the front door and it's Trish's date who thinks batteries are batteries. * Trish and Zack are in a drive thru and Todd, who has a crush on Trish, is working with an off brand battery. * The family visits a museum of art. * The family parrot is running low on batteries, Herb gives him a long lasting Duracell battery and he talks so much they take his cage outside. * The family spends some time at the miniature golf course with a friend who's using an off brand battery. * The family goes on a fishing trip while on vacation. Halloween costumes of Herb and Flo, complete with latex masks, were released in North America.

Uribe started his political career in his home department of Antioquia. He held offices in the Public Enterprises of Medell√≠n and in the Ministry of Labor and was the director of the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (1980‚Äì1982). He became Mayor of Medell√≠n in October 1982. He was Senator between 1986 and 1994 and finally Governor of Antioquia between 1995 and 1997 before he was elected President of Colombia in 2002. Following his 2002 election, Uribe led an all out military offensive against leftist guerrilla groups such as the FARC and the ELN with funding and backing from the Clinton and Bush Administrations in the form of a 2.8 billion dollars direct foreign aid package called \\"Plan Colombia\\", as well as leading a controversial effort in the demobilizing of the rightwing paramilitary group known as the AUC, all of which are part the Colombian Armed Conflict. On 13 January 2009 the United States awarded Uribe the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his role in fighting along the US lead War on Terror in the Colombian Armed Conflict. However, his role in the conflict was accompanied by large-scale alleged exactions: thousands of civilians were killed by the Colombian army (see \\"False positives\\" scandal) with almost total impunity, being investigated by the United Nations. and millions of people have been victims of forced displacement. In August 2010 he was appointed Vice-chairman of the UN panel investigating the Gaza flotilla raid. In 2012 Uribe and a group of political allies founded the Democratic Center movement to contest the 2014 national elections. He was elected senator in the 2014 parliamentary election and took office in July 2014. Uribe was critical of his successor Juan Manuel Santos's peace talks with the FARC guerrillas. In August 2020 the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia ordered his arrest as part of an investigation into bribery and witness tampering as well as crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement with right wing paramilitary units in the Massacres at El Aro and La Granja, which took place while he was Governor of Antioquia. Early life and education √Ålvaro Uribe was born in Medell√≠n, the oldest of five children. His father, Alberto Uribe, was a landowner. At the age of 10 his family left their Salgar ranch and moved to Medell√≠n. He graduated in 1970 from the Instituto Jorge Robledo after being expelled from the Medellin Benedictine School for arguing with the priests. Uribe studied Law at the University of Antioquia and he graduated in 1977. His father was killed by a guerrilla group during a 1983 kidnapping attempt.Colombia, laboratorio de embrujos.

Retrieved 3 June 2007. After his father's death, Uribe focused on his political career and became a member of the center-left Colombian Liberal Party. He served on the Medell√≠n city council between 1984 and 1986. In 1993 he attended Harvard University, receiving a Certificate of Special Studies in Administration and Management from Harvard Extension School and a Certificate in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution from Harvard Law School. Between 1998 and 1999, after having completed his term in office as the governor of Antioquia, he studied at St Antony's College, Oxford, England, on a Chevening-Sim√≥n Bol√≠var scholarship and was appointed Senior Associate Member at St Antony's College. Uribe married to Lina Mar√≠a Moreno Mej√≠a in 1979. They have two sons, Tom√°s and Jer√≥nimo. Political career In 1976 Uribe was Chief of Assets for the Public Enterprises of Medell√≠n (Empresas P√∫blicas de Medell√≠n). He served as Secretary General of the Ministry of Labor under Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen from 1977 to 1978. During this time he married Lina Moreno, a philosopher from Medell√≠n. President Julio C√©sar Turbay named him Director of Civil Aviation from 1980 to 1982. He left this position to become Mayor of Medell√≠n in 1982. =Senator of Colombia= Uribe was elected one of Antioquia's senators from 1986 to 1990 and again from 1990 to 1994. As senator, he served as president of the Seventh Commission and he supported laws dealing with reform of pensions, labor and social security, as well as promotion of administrative careers, cooperative banking, brown sugar, and protection for women. Some of the legislation later drew criticism, in particular that which reduced the state's responsibility for social security. During his later term he received official and unofficial awards as one of the \\"best senators\\" (1990, 1992 and 1993) and as the senator with the \\"best legislative initiatives\\" (1992).√Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez.

In 1998, Human Rights Watch stated: \\"we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the Magdalena Medio and of the southern Cesar regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians that were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or which rejected joining the cooperative groups\\".World Report 1998: Colombia, Human Rights Watch.

The slogan reads \\"Firm hand, big heart\\". Uribe ran as an independent liberal candidate, having unofficially separated from his former party. His electoral platform centered on confronting Colombia's main guerrilla movement, the FARC. Other relevant propositions included slashing the national administration's expenses, fighting corruption and initiating a national referendum to resolve several of the country's political and economic concerns. Colombia's government under president Andres Pastrana was undergoing peace negotiations with the largest guerrilla group, the FARC. but after four years of peace negotiations without cease fires, disapproval of Colombia's main parties grew. Violence was rampant. The FARC had, as they claimed, taken control of some 100 municipalities of Colombia out of 1093 at that moment, kidnappings were common and were among the highest in the world, as well as the assassination and crime rate. AUC was also gaining influence and expanding its massacres, and illicit drugs production, competing with FARC and ELN and other narcotraffickers. Until at least 2001, polls showed that at most 2% of the electorate contemplated voting for Uribe and that the Liberal Party's Horacio Serpa would probably win. But public mood shifted in his favor after the peace process with the guerrillas degenerated. The administration of President Andr√©s Pastrana had failed for four years to secure a ceasefire, and Uribe began to be seen as the candidate who may provide a viable security program. Former General Harold Bedoya, a candidate with a superficially similar program, remained marginalized. Uribe was elected President of Colombia in the first round of 26 May 2002 elections with 53% of the popular vote. His running mate was Francisco Santos Calder√≥n, a member of the Santos family, who have a long-lasting tradition as members of the Colombian Liberal Party and as owners of Colombian daily newspaper El Tiempo. Santos was also one of the founders of the anti-kidnapping NGO Fundaci√≥n Pa√≠s Libre, created shortly after his own experience as a hostage of drug lord Pablo Escobar. Observers considered the elections mostly free of foul play at the national level, but there were instances of active intimidation of voters and candidates, by the actions of guerrilla and paramilitary groups. 47% of the potential electorate voted, down from the previous round of voting. Some of Uribe's opponents made accusations during his campaign, especially in a speech by Horacio Serpa and a book published by Newsweek's Joseph Contreras, who interviewed Uribe that year. Claims centered on Uribe's alleged past personal relationships with members of the Medell√≠n Cartel and the sympathy that some paramilitary spokesmen expressed towards Uribe as a candidate. Uribe and his supporters denied or undermined these claims, and critics never committed to legal action because there was no evidence for these claims.

And by the end of his first term in office the AUC had other right- wing militias agree to disarm and go to jail under special sentences of seven years.The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Terrorist Organization Profile:United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126 Uribe stated that the government had to first show military superiority in order to eventually make the guerrillas return to the negotiating table with a more flexible position, even if this would only happen after his term in office expired. Early in his government, he was quoted as saying that Colombia's main concerns were the challenges of terrorism and the narcotics trade.

The policy intended to achieve these goals by: # Engaging the civilian population more actively. # Supporting soldiers. # Increasing intelligence capacity. # Reinstating control over national roads. # Demobilizing illegal groups. # Integrating the armed forces services. # Increasing defense spending.Democratic Security and Defense Policy , Embassy of Colombia, Washington, D.C. In early 2002, Uribe's administration decreed a one-time tax of 1.2% of the liquid assets of the higher income Colombians and corporations, with the goal of raising US$800 million. More than $650 million was collected before the final payment quota was made, surpassing original expectations. Another goal was to increase defense expenditures from a current level of about 3.6% of GDP to 6% of GDP by 2006. According to official government statistical information from August 2004, in two years, homicides, kidnappings, and terrorist attacks in Colombia decreased by as much as 50% ‚Äì their lowest levels in almost 20 years. In 2003, there were 7,000 fewer homicides than in 2002 ‚Äì a decrease of 27%. By April 2004, the government had established a permanent police or military presence in every Colombian municipality for the first time in decades.OpEd: After a dark period, a better Colombia by Luis Alberto Moreno, Boston Globe, 19 August 2004.

In January 2005, Human Rights Watch stated: \\"Paramilitary groups maintain close ties with a number of Colombian military units. The Uribe administration has yet to take effective action to break these ties by investigating and prosecuting high-ranking members of the armed forces credibly alleged to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. Credible reports indicate that some of the territories from which the military has ejected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia, FARC) are now under the control of paramilitary groups, which continue to carry out indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population\\".World Report 2005: Colombia, Human Rights Watch.

An anti-terror statute criticized by many human rights groups was approved by Congress on 11 December 2003 but was struck down in August 2004 by the Colombian Constitutional Court during its review. The statute granted the military judicial police rights and allowed limited arrests and communication intercepts without warrants. It was struck down due to an error in the approval procedure, an objection the court has also presented towards other bills. After some of the AUC's main leaders had declared a cease-fire and agreed to concentrate in Santa Fe de Ralito, several paramilitary demobilizations began in earnest, thousands of their \\"rank and file\\" fighters were disarmed and incorporated into government rehabilitation programs late in 2004. The main AUC leaders, who would be held responsible for atrocities, remained in the concentration zone and continued talks with the government's High Commissioner for Peace, Luis Carlos Restrepo. A number of the paramilitary members who initially demobilized in Medell√≠n apparently did not actually belong to the AUC and this caused public concern. The AUC commanders claimed, as the year ended, that they had difficulties controlling all of their personnel from their isolated position, that they had already demobilized some 20% of their forces, and that they would await for the drafting of the necessary legal framework before making any more significant moves. In 2005, Uribe and Colombia's congressmen prepared for the elections held in May and March 2006 respectively. FARC, which had been perceived as relatively passive, began to show signs of what analysts considered renewed vigor in February. It made a series of attacks against small military units, which left at least three dozen casualties. Uribe said in a speech that FARC remained strong and had never retreated, and he credited Colombia's soldiers for previous successes against FARC activities. Negotiations with the AUC also increased public anxiety. Discussions continued about the legal provisions to assure \\"justice, reparation and truth\\" after a full demobilization. Also according to many observers, paramilitary activity continued despite AUC's declared cease-fire, albeit at a reduced rate. The demobilizations were renewed in November and finished in the complete disbandment of the group by middle February 2007, although some of the paramilitary units rejected disbandment and returned to criminal activity. These groups became known as the Black Eagles. This group is relatively small in comparison to the AUC and have not been able to achieve the notoriety or the military power of their predecessor, but are present on some former paramilitary areas, like Catatumbo and Choco. The Colombian Congress agreed to prosecute AUC leaders under the controversial Justice and Peace Law, by which the paramilitary leaders would receive reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony and declarations of their entire criminal activity: links with drug dealers, assassinations, disappearances and massacres.Ley de Justicia y Paz , Congress of the Republic of Colombia, 15 July 2005. Retrieved 29 January 2008. These declarations are to be brought before a specialized judge, in a public hearing attended by the victims. The paramilitary leaders are also forced to \\"repair\\" the damage caused to the victims or their families: By disclosing the location of mass graves and by repaying each of them through economic assistance. As of 2008, these public hearings are still underway. To improve its results in the fight against guerrilla warfare, the Colombian army carried out mass executions of civilians transformed into false positives. If exactions of this kind already existed, the phenomenon became widespread from 2002, encouraged by the bonuses paid to the soldiers and by quasi-absolute impunity. In 2010 a mass grave containing 2,000 corpses was discovered near a military base in the department of Meta. This is the largest mass grave discovered to date in South America. In 2008, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nation's Human Rights Council criticised the continuation of forced disappearances in Colombia. According to the CODHES human rights NGO, forced displacement during Uribe's term affected over 2.4 million Colombian nationals by the end of 2009. A spokesperson for the organization stated: \\"It's true that there have been advances for some segments of society, but not for everyone, which casts into doubt the democratic component of (the government's) security policy\\". From 2000 to 2008, more that 130.000 Colombian nationals fled to Ecuador. According to the International Displacement Monitoring Centre, an estimated total of 3.303.979 to 4.915.579 people have been internally displaced in Colombia. =Colombian parapolitics scandal= In November 2006, a political crisis emerged as several of Uribe's congressional supporters were questioned or charged by the Colombian Supreme Court and the office of the Attorney General for having alleged links to paramilitary groups. √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo, brother of Uribe's Foreign Minister Mar√≠a Consuelo Ara√∫jo, was among those summoned for questioning. In November, the former ambassador to Chile, Salvador Arana, was charged with the murder of a mayor in a small town in the Department of Sucre. The Supreme Court sentenced Arana to 40 years in prison in December 2009. In April 2007, Senator Gustavo Petro made several accusations against Uribe during a televised congressional debate about paramilitarism in Antioquia. Petro said that some of the Uribe family's farms in the north of the country had been previously used as staging grounds for paramilitary forces. He also showed a picture of Santiago Uribe, the President's brother, together with Fabio Ochoa, a drug dealer, in 1985. Petro also argued that Governor Uribe's office allowed paramilitary personnel to participate in some of the legal cooperative neighborhood watch groups known as CONVIVIR. Another accusation concerned the possible participation of a helicopter belonging to the former Antioquia Governor's administration during a paramilitary massacre. Two days later, Uribe publicly revealed that former US Vice President Al Gore had canceled his participation in a pro-environment event Uribe was to attend in Miami due to the continuing allegations against him. The Colombian President reacted by organizing a press conference during which he addressed several of the accusations Senator Petro and others had made against him. Uribe argued that his family had nothing to do with any massacres and that they had already sold the implicated farms several years before the alleged events. He also stated that the Uribes and the Ochoas were both famous in the horse breeding business, causing their meetings to be both common and public. He claimed that the helicopter's hours and missions had been strictly logged, making it impossible for it to have participated in any massacre. Uribe said that he supported the CONVIVIR groups but was not solely responsible for their creation, adding that other civilian and military authorities also participated in their oversight. He also said that he dismantled some CONVIVIR groups when doubts began to surround their activities. On 22 April 2008, former senator Mario Uribe Escobar, one of the Colombian President's cousins and a close political ally, was arrested after being denied asylum at the Costa Rican embassy in Bogot√°, as part of a judicial inquiry into the links between politicians and paramilitary groups. Mario Uribe has been accused of meeting with paramilitary commander Salvatore Mancuso in order to plan land seizures. On 22 February 2011, Uribe Escobar was convicted and sentenced to 90 months in jail after the Colombian Supreme Court found him guilty of the charge of conspiring with paramilitary groups. On 23 April 2008, Uribe revealed that a former paramilitary fighter had accused him of helping to plan the 1997 massacre of El Aro, a charge which he said was under official investigation. Uribe described the accuser as a \\"disgruntled convict with an axe to grind\\", denied the charges and said there was proof of his innocence. The Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the paramilitary in question, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hern√°ndez, had not mentioned Uribe during previous declarations made more than five years ago, when he was sentenced for his own role in the massacre. The magazine also listed a number of possible inconsistencies in his most recent testimony, including the alleged presence of General Manosalva, who had died months before the date of the meeting where the massacre was planned. =Wiretapping scandal= In May 2009 Colombian prosecutors officially began an investigation on a series of illegal wiretapping and spying activities carried out against opposition politicians, judges, journalists and others by the Department of Administrative Security (DAS). The probe has involved several of Uribe's top aides and former high-ranking personnel within the department. Former DAS counterintelligence director Jorge Alberto Lagos has told investigators that information on the country's Supreme Court judges was provided to Bernardo Moreno and Jos√© Obdulio, two of Uribe's aides. Gaviria has claimed that criminals have tried to damage the government's image as part of a \\"political war\\" against the administration. El Tiempo has criticized these explanations, raising questions about the President's knowledge of these activities. Uribe himself has denied ordering any illegal wiretapping and claims that those responsible for spying on the opposition are part of \\"a mafia group that hurts the Colombian Democracy, freedom, the country and the government itself\\". The DAS, an \\"intelligence service that answers to the president\\" as described by the Washington Post, has been the subject of earlier controversies during the Uribe administration. According to Revista Semana, revelations about the infiltration of paramilitaries affected the entity under former DAS chief Jorge Noguera in 2007 and further accusations have continued to surface. The magazine reported that information gathered by the DAS has been allegedly forwarded to paramilitaries, narcotraffickers and guerrillas. Previously, former DAS computer systems chief Rafael Garc√≠a had claimed that the department and Colombian paramilitaries were involved in a plan to assassinate Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. According to Reporters Without Borders, Colombia was demoted from 114th to 145th place between 2002 and 2010 on freedom of the press. =International relations= Uribe meeting with then Brazilian president Lula da Silva.

He has been publicly recognized as a supporter of the US war on drugs by continually implementing the anti-drug strategy of Plan Colombia. He is also recognized as a supporter of the US war on terror, and the invasion of Iraq.

On 30 December 2005, Uribe signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with Mercosur and gives Colombian products preferential access to the market of 230 million people. Trade negotiations have also been underway with Mexico, Chile, the Andean community and the USA over its current proposal. After the 2009 Honduran election Uribe joined a list of leaders that are supporting the next government following the coup d'√©tat. \\"Colombia recognizes the next government\\", Uribe told reporters during an Ibero-American summit in Portugal on 30 November 2009. \\"A democratic process has taken place in Honduras with high participation, without fraud\\". In 2009, bilateral negotiations between the United States and Colombia which would give U.S. forces increased access to several Colombian military bases for the stated purpose of fighting terrorism and the drug trade generated controversy throughout the region. Venezuela's Hugo Ch√°vez criticized the proposed deal as the creation of a purported \\"imperialist beachhead\\" while Colombian diplomats defended the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that \\"there was no intention to expand the number of permanent [U.S.] personnel [in Colombia] beyond the maximum permitted by Congress\\". Other Latin American nations, including Brazil, also expressed their own concerns about the matter. On 2 July 2008 a covert rescue operation codenamed Operation Jaque by the Colombian Special Forces disguised as FARC guerrillas resulted in the rescue of Senator and former Presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, the Americans Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell and eleven soldiers and police officers. It was done without bloodshed and led to the capture of two guerrilla leaders. The operation heightened Uribe's already soaring popularity. Uribe stated that the rescue operation \\"was guided in every way by the light of the Holy Spirit, the protection of our Lord and the Virgin Mary\\".Rosary plays important role in hostage rescue in Colombia Catholic News Agency, 9 July 2008 The hostages agreed, indicating that they had spent much time in captivity praying the rosary, and Ms. Betancourt, formerly a lapsed Catholic who prayed daily on a wooden rosary which she made while a hostage,Betancourt to visit Lourdes shrine Reuters 7 July 2008 attributed the rescue as follows: \\"I am convinced this is a miracle of the Virgin Mary.

Despite significant political differences, until 2007 Colombia and Venezuela had only one major impasse in their relations, the Rodrigo Granda affair, which had been overcome thanks to the direct talks between Uribe and Ch√°vez. Uribe's main political problem during 2007 was his handling of the humanitarian exchange situation: the FARC guerrillas held over 700 hostages, living in poor conditions in the Colombian jungle. These hostages included presidential candidate and French citizen Ingrid Betancourt (later freed), three American citizens (later freed), and several Colombian politicians and law enforcers. Some of the captives had been in the jungle for over 10 years. For the release of 40 of these hostages (the so-called \\"canjeables\\" or \\"exchangeables\\") the FARC demands a Demilitarized Zone that includes the towns of Florida and Pradera. The government has refused to comply with this demand, deciding instead to push for a military rescue of the hostages, or by searching the mediation of third parties like Switzerland and the Catholic Church. As all of those plans failed to get any positive outcome, Uribe appointed Senator Piedad C√≥rdoba to mediate between the government and the guerrillas in an attempt to secure the liberation of the hostages. C√≥rdoba then asked Ch√°vez to mediate as well, with Uribe's consent. French president Nicolas Sarkozy was also willing to help in the mediation effort. On 8 November 2007 Ch√°vez met with alias \\"Iv√°n M√°rquez\\" one of the highest members of the FARC and some other members of its secretariat at the Palacio de Miraflores in a widely publicized event. After the event Chavez promised to deliver evidence that some of the hostages remained alive. When Ch√°vez met with Sarkozy on 19 November, Ch√°vez was still waiting for the evidence. Lacking the \\"proof of life\\" that was promised to the families of the hostages, and seeing prominent FARC members using the media attention to promote their own ideology, Uribe became disgruntled with the mediation process. On 22 November Uribe abruptly ended the mediation after Ch√°vez spoke with the high command of the Colombian military during a call made by C√≥rdoba. Uribe had warned Ch√°vez against any attempt to talk to military high command. Ch√°vez initially accepted the decision, but tensions escalated as the presidents increasingly attacked each other verbally, with Ch√°vez claiming that Uribe and the U.S. simply preferred the war continue, and Uribe implying Ch√°vez supported the rebels. Ch√°vez announced a \\"freeze\\" of political relations and called Uribe a \\"pawn of the empire\\" and cut contact with the Colombian government, including rejecting calls from the Colombian embassy in Caracas. He announced his intent to sharply reduce bilateral commerce. Ch√°vez continued negotiating with the rebels and eventually secured the unilateral release of two, then four more, hostages to Venezuela which were meant as signs of good faith and preceded calls for more negotiations, which Uribe dismissed. Uribe along with other Latin American leaders during the 2010 XXI Rio summit. A regional crisis began after Colombian troops killed FARC commander Ra√∫l Reyes in a guerrilla camp inside Ecuadorian borders on 1 March. Ecuador, Venezuela and Nicaragua, which has a maritime dispute with Colombia, cut diplomatic ties with Colombia as a response, with Chavez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa ordering troops to their respective borders with Colombia. Uribe in response placed the armed forces on high alert but did not move his troops to confront them even though the Colombian army is larger than Ecuador's and Venezuela's combined. Several countries in the Americas criticized the incursion into Ecuador as a violation of national sovereignty, which was also denounced by an OAS resolution. The United States backed Colombia's position and internal support for the action remained strong, Uribe's popularity rising as a result. The impasse was finally solved when Leonel Fern√°ndez, President of the Dominican Republic, hosted an emergency summit of Latin American nations in Santo Domingo. He got Uribe, Correa, and Chavez to shake hands. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega also announced the restoration of relations with Colombia at which Uribe told him that he would send him the bill for the plane fare for his ambassador. In early March 2010, judge Eloy Velasco of Spain brought forth allegations against Hugo Ch√°vez, the FARC and ETA of conspiring to assassinate Uribe, along with other Colombian political figures.Graves acusaciones de nexos entre el Gobierno venezolano, las FARC Y ETA =Socio- economic policy= The Uribe administration has continued dealing with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, securing loans, agreeing to cut expenses, agreeing to continue debt payments, privatize public companies and foment investor confidence, in order to comply with financial orthodoxy.

At least 25% of the electorate needed to vote on each of the 15 proposals in order it to be accepted, but overall participation was only 24.8% and only the first proposal (\\"political death for the corrupt\\") achieved this.

A number of Uribe's own supporters did not participate, as they found the referendum, which had been modified by Congress and later by the Judicial branch, to be too complex, long and uninspiring. Some also pointed out that extraordinary electoral initiatives (that is, those voted outside standard electoral dates) have traditionally suffered complications in Colombia, including a lack of participation.

For years, Colombian presidents had been limited to a single four-year term and had been barred from any sort of reelection, even if nonconsecutive. Uribe originally had expressed his disagreement with consecutive reelection during his campaign, but later changed his mind, first at a private level and later in public appearances. Many analysts considered that, in order to secure the approval of this reform, Uribe may have slacked on his campaign promises, because of what has been perceived as his indirect bribing of congressmen, through the alleged assignment of their relatives to the diplomatic corps and through promises of investment in their regions of origin. Uribe's supporters consider that no actual bribing took place, and that a consensus among the diverse sectors that back Uribe's policies in Congress had to be reached through political negotiation.

With this amendment, Uribe was re-elected on 28 May 2006 for a second presidential term (2006‚Äì2010), and became the first president to be consecutively re- elected in Colombia in over a century. He received about 62% of the vote, winning over 7.3 million votes.Colombia's Uribe wins second term, BBC News, 29 May 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2007.

In a statement made on 28 May, OAS mentioned that the elections \\"have taken place in an atmosphere of freedom, transparency and normalcy\\", despite incidents \\"related to the use of indelible ink, voter substitution and the accreditation of electoral witnesses, though these have no effect on the electoral process as a whole\\" and \\"developments in northern Santander province that took the lives of army personnel and left others injured in an ambush carried out by subversive groups\\".OAS Observation Mission: Colombian Elections Transparent, Normal, Organization of American States, 28 May 2006.

According to Medina, the government had not fulfilled that promise, prompting her declaration. The Attorney General of Colombia ordered her arrest, after which she turned herself over to authorities and testified to the Supreme Court as part of the investigation. The opposition Alternative Democratic Pole party asked for Uribe to be investigated for bribery.Colombian opposition calls for Uribe bribery probe, Reuters, 29 April 2008. Retrieved 29 April 2008. After the declarations made by Medina, the Supreme Court of Colombia sent copies of the process to other judicial authorities, who have the jurisdiction to investigate several former and current cabinet members and other high officials. The Accusations Commission of the Colombian Congress will study the matter and decide if there are enough merits to officially investigate Uribe. =Popularity= Since his 2002 election Uribe's approval ratings had remained high, usually staying between 60 and 70 percent after eight years in office, but this status has radically changed. During early 2008, Uribe's approval rating hit 81%, one of the highest popularity levels of his entire presidency. In June 2008, after Operation Jaque, Uribe's approval rate rose to an unprecedented 91%. In May 2009 his popularity had dropped to 68%. According to a June 2009 Ipsos-Napole√≥n Franco national poll for the 2010 presidential campaign, covering over thirty cities and municipalities, Uribe's overall approval rating was 76% but only 57% would vote in favor of his potential reelection for a third term. During the eight years of Uribe's government, internal polling, communications strategy and government and presidential image were managed by Uribe's Communications Advisors Jaime Bermudez, who later became Ambassador to Argentina and then Foreign Affairs Minister; Jorge Mario Eastman, who was Vice-minister of Defense before and left to become Vice-minister of Defense again; and Mauricio Carradini who served under Uribe until the end the period in office. Uribe's popularity on leaving office was measured to be between 79% and 84% depending on the source consulted. However, those opinion polls in Colombia were mostly carried out among the inhabitants of big cities and did not include the opinion of rural populations, most affected by war and poverty. Some journalists were also surprised that the president's popularity is not reflected in the elections, where the abstention varies between 50% and 80% of the electorate. In 2019, 69% of the population surveyed said they had an unfavourable image of Uribe, while 26% said they had a favourable image. =2010 third term proposal= As the end of Uribe's second term approached, his supporters sought a new amendment that would grant him the right to run for a third term.The Economist, 10 January 2009 U.S. print edition, page 34. \\"Politics in Colombia: Third Term Temptation\\" In May 2009, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos resigned so he could run for president in case Uribe either did not or could not run again. Santos said before resigning that he did not want to run against Uribe. Congress backed a proposed referendum on the matter, but the Constitutional Court rejected it after reviewing the resulting law. On 26 February 2010 lead justice Mauricio Gonzalez publicly announced the Court's decision. Gonzalez said that the Court had found numerous irregularities in the way signatures were obtained to allow the referendum to pass. He also said that the law calling for a referendum contained \\"substantial violations to the democratic principle\\" that made it unconstitutional. Uribe stated that he would respect the decision but called for voters to continue supporting his administration's policies in the upcoming elections.\\"Colombian judges deny Alvaro Uribe third term poll\\", BBC, 27 February 2010 The Constitutional Court not only threw out the referendum, but declared Colombian presidents could only serve two terms, even if they were nonconsecutive. This effectively foreclosed a potential Uribe run for president in 2014. The Constitution has since been amended to limit the president to a single four-year term, restoring the status quo that prevailed before 2005. Post-presidency and controversy Uribe (center) with his students at Georgetown University In late 2010, a few months after leaving office, Uribe was named visiting scholar at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service, where he taught students in different disciplines as a guest lecturer in seminars and classes. In 2011, Uribe was granted an honorary award by the Latin American Student Association of Georgetown, for his leadership and commitment with the Latin American community of the university. Uribe's appointment at Georgetown sparked controversy. In September, more than 150 scholars, including 10 Georgetown professors and leading experts on Latin America and Colombia, signed a letter calling for Uribe's firing. A Colombian humorist suggested Uribe teach a course on wiretapping, which his administration illegally conducted on opposition figures, human rights workers, journalists and Supreme Court justices. Many students protested, with some hanging banners calling him a \\"mass murderer\\" for the deaths of thousands of civilians that the army was accused of later dressed up as guerrillas. In November 2010, while at the Georgetown campus, Uribe was served a criminal subpoena in the case Claudia Balcero Giraldo v. Drummond, regarding hundreds of civilians murdered by paramilitary forces loyal to Uribe. After a year at Georgetown, Uribe left to continue with his personal endeavors in Colombia. In October 2012, News Corporation welcomed Uribe to the Board of Directors upon the retirement of Andrew Knight, John Thornton, and Arthur Siskind. In 2012, Uribe joined the Leadership Council of Concordia, a nonprofit organization in New York City that creates public- private partnerships. Prosecutors accuse Uribe of helping to plan paramilitary massacres in La Granja (1996), San Roque (1996) and El Aro (1997) while he was governor of Antioquia, and the February 1998 assassination of Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Valle, an attorney and human rights defender working with victims in those cases. =Senator of Colombia (2014‚Äì2020)= Uribe, who had served in the Senate prior to his election as president, is the only former Colombian head of state in history to have become a Senator after occupying the presidency. Founded by the former president, the Democratic Center (Centro Democr√°tico) party managed to win 20 seats in the Senate during the 9 March congressional election, the second highest number after the 21 seats held by President Juan Manuel Santos U Party (Partido de la U). Uribe's new Democratic Center party also won 19 of the House of Representatives' 166 seats. Uribe campaigned actively against the peace deal between the Juan Manuel Santos administration and FARC. He argued the deal would undermine the constitution by appointing FARC leaders, who received no prison terms for their crimes, to congress. =Home detention= In August 2020, Uribe was placed under house arrest at his hacienda \\"El Uberrimo\\" by the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia, while it decides whether he should stand trial for bribery and witness tampering as well as crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in El Aro and La Granja massacres, which took place while he was Governor of Antioquia, as part of ongoing judicial investigations. The day following his arrest, Uribe tested positive for COVID-19, but he announced he was cured 6 days later. On 18 August 2020, Uribe resigned his seat in the Senate of Colombia.

He is immortal and capable of creating practically anything, but is portrayed as being unlucky in love. He is described as working the known metals of the time, including brass, copper, iron, gold, and silver. The great works of Ilmarinen include the crafting of the dome of the sky and the forging of the Sampo. His usual epithet in the Kalevala is seppo, a poetic word for \\"smith\\". and the source of the given name Seppo.  Etymology and origin  Cognates of the Finnish word ilma ('air') are attested in almost all the main Finno-Ugric languages apart from the Mari and Mordvinic languages, allowing the reconstruction of proto-Finno-Ugric *ilma meaning something like 'sky'. This noun is also attested as the name of a god in Khanty (Num-Il…ôm), Komi (Jen), Udmurt (Inmar) and the Finnic languages, suggesting that proto-Finno-Ugric likewise had a sky god credited with creating the sky called *Ilma. In Proto-Finnic, the suffix -r(i), which is used to form words for people associated with the root word, was added to *ilma to give the god-name *Ilmar(i) ('Sky-being'); rare attestations of similar forms such as Udmurt Ilmar and S√°mi Ilmaris seem to be loans from Finnic.) In Kalevala metre poetry, the diminutive suffix -nen enabled the formation of the name Ilmarinen, which neatly fills two trochaic feet and so became the dominant form of the name in that tradition. Ilmari(nen) is believed to have taken on the qualities of a smith through the Proto-Finnic contact with iron-working cultures, such as the Indo-European Balts : rune 8 (Sepp√§, The Smith) explicitly refers to Ilmollini as jumala (god). in or speakers of Common Germanic. Ilmarinen is also directly appealed to for aid in several incantation runes. Insofar as Elias L√∂nnrot heavily redacted the original runes collected by him and others, it's valuable to differentiate between the Kalevala and the original poems sung by rune singers. Other names for Ilmarinen that are found in rune variants include Ilmorinen and Ilmollini.  Stories about Ilmarinen  =The forging of the Sampo= The Forging of the Sampo by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, 1893 From the Kalevala :Summary based on When the old sage, V√§in√§m√∂inen, was traveling wide in the search of a wife, he was captured by the old mistress of Pohjola, the land of the North. In return for giving him safe passage from the land of Pohjola back to his native country, the enchantress Louhi of Pohjola wanted to have made the Sampo, a magic artifact. V√§in√§m√∂inen replied that he could not make her one, but that Ilmarinen could, and promised to send the great smith to Pohjola to do just that. In return for this wondrous device, Louhi would also give Ilmarinen her daughter's hand in marriage. On having returned home, V√§in√§m√∂inen tries to awe Ilmarinen with tales of the maiden's beauty and so lure him to Pohjola. Ilmarinen sees through the ruse, however, and refuses. Not to be outdone, V√§in√§m√∂inen tricks the smith into climbing a fir tree trying to bring down moonlight that is glimmering on the branches. Conjuring a storm-wind with his magical song, V√§in√§m√∂inen then blows Ilmarinen away to Pohjola. Once there, Ilmarinen is approached by the toothless hag, Louhi, and her daughter, the Maiden of Pohjola, and having seen the maiden's beauty, consents to build a Sampo. For three days, he sought a place to build a great forge. In that forge he placed metals and started working, tending the magic fire with help of the slaves of Pohjola. On the first day, Ilmarinen looked down into the flames and saw that the metal had taken the form of a crossbow with a golden arch, a copper shaft and quarrel-tips of silver. But the bow had an evil spirit, asking for a new victim each day, and so Ilmarinen broke it and cast the pieces back into the fire. On the second day, there came a metal ship from the fire, with ribs of gold and copper oars. Though beautiful to behold, it too was evil at heart, being too eager to rush towards battle, and so, Ilmarinen broke the magic boat apart and cast back the pieces once more. On the third day, a metal cow emerged, with golden horns and the sun and the stars on its brow. But alas, it was ill-tempered, and so the magical heifer was broken into pieces and melted down. On the fourth day, a golden plow is pulled from the forge, with a golden plowshare, a copper beam and silver handles. But it too is flawed, plowing up planted fields and furrowing meadows. In despair, Ilmarinen destroys his creation once more. Angered at his lack of success, Ilmarinen conjures the four winds to fan the flames. The winds blow for three days, until finally, the Sampo is born, taking the shape of a magic mill that produces grain, salt and gold. Pleased with his creation at last, Ilmarinen presents it to Louhi, who promptly locks it in a vault deep underground. Returning triumphant to the Maiden of Pohjola, Ilmarinen bids her to become his wife. To his dismay, she refuses to leave her native land, forcing him to return home alone and dejected. From original rune variants Variants of the original runes used by L√∂nnrot in compiling the Kalevala present a different picture of Ilmarinen. In one variant of The Sampo for example, Ilmarinen goes willingly to Pohjola to forge the Sampo, not because he was tricked by V√§in√§m√∂inen, but in order to redeem V√§in√§m√∂inen from death. In addition, the same rune portrays Ilmarinen as returning home successfully with the Maiden of the North. Ilmarinen's portrayal as \\"unlucky in love\\" in the Kalevala is primarily due to L√∂nnrot's own choices while revising and compiling the original runes to form a cohesive narrative.L√∂nnrot's revisions and even rewriting of runes is discussed at length in . In another example from an original rune entitled Kosinta (The Courtship), Ilmarinen takes a journey to compete for Hiisi's daughter. He again succeeds in obtaining his wife after completing the tasks of ploughing a field of vipers, bringing Tuoni's bear, and bringing the pike of Tuoni. =Ilmarinen's bride of gold= From the Kalevala :Summary based on After the loss of his first wife to Kullervo's curse, the disheartened Ilmarinen attempts to craft a new one from gold and silver, but finds the golden wife hard and cold. Dismayed, he attempts to wed her to his brother V√§in√§m√∂inen instead, but the old sage rejects her, saying that the golden wife ought to be cast back into the furnace and tells Ilmarinen to \\"forge from her a thousand trinkets\\". Speaking to all of his people, he further adds: > \\"Every child of Northland, listen, > Whether poor, or fortune-favored: > Never bow before an image > Born of molten gold and silver: > Never while the sunlight brightens, > Never while the moonlight glimmers, > Choose a maiden of the metals, > Choose a bride from gold created > Cold the lips of golden maiden, > Silver breathes the breath of sorrow.\\" > The tale of the Golden Wife can be seen as a cautionary tale based on the theme of \\"money cannot buy happiness\\". To a contemporary reader, there is also a similarity to the hubristic nature of the Golem legend, or to Frankenstein, in that even the most skilled of mortals cannot rival divine perfection when creating life. From original rune variants In another example of L√∂nnrot's editorial license, the Kullervo cycle originally existed as an independent series of runes. In his effort to create a homogeneous narrative, L√∂nnrot presented Kullervo as Ilmarinen's slave in order to insert Kullervo into the Sampo cycle of runes. However, some scholars are convinced that the Golden Bride was originally an independent rune that was eventually added to the Sampo cycle. Furthermore, independent variants of the Kultamorsian (Golden Bride) rune have been collected. In Matti Kuusi's opinion, the warning reproduced above is a secondary element that was probably added during the Christian period. Rather than serving as a cautionary tale, the original runes probably expressed the widespread myth of a Golden Woman found throughout Arctic Eurasia. In popular culture *A portrayal of Ilmarinen and depiction of selected tales from the Kalevala can be found in the 1959 movie Sampo (film). *Finnish metal band Amorphis released their ninth album in 2009 called Skyforger, which is a concept album based around the stories and legends of Ilmarinen. *The band Turisas recorded a song called \\"Cursed Be Iron\\" about the aforementioned smith, and he is mentioned in \\"Rauta\\" by Korpiklaani. *In the trilogy The Winter of the World by Michael Scott Rohan, Ilmarinen is the godlike Power revered by the duergar, who say he forged the mountains in which they live.

Prolific in film since the early 1990s, she is particularly known for her portrayals of emotionally troubled women in both independent and blockbuster films, and has received many accolades, including an Academy Award, two Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globes. Time magazine named Moore one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. After studying theatre at Boston University, Moore began her career with a series of television roles. From 1985 to 1988, she was a regular in the soap opera As the World Turns, earning a Daytime Emmy Award for her performance. Her film debut was in Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), and she continued to play small roles for the next four years, including in the thriller The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992). Moore first received critical attention with Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993), and successive performances in Vanya on 42nd Street (1994) and Safe (1995) continued this acclaim. Starring roles in the blockbusters Nine Months (1995) and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) established her as a leading lady in Hollywood. Moore received considerable recognition in the late 1990s and early 2000s, earning Oscar nominations for Boogie Nights (1997), The End of the Affair (1999), Far from Heaven (2002) and The Hours (2002). In the first of these, she played a 1970s pornographic actress, while the other three starred her as an unhappy, mid-20th century housewife. She also had success with the films The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), Hannibal (2001), Children of Men (2006), A Single Man (2009), The Kids Are All Right (2010), and Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and won an Emmy Award for her portrayal of Sarah Palin in the television film Game Change (2012).

In addition to acting, Moore has written a series of children's books about a character named \\"Freckleface Strawberry\\". She is married to director Bart Freundlich, with whom she has two children. Early life Moore was born Julie Anne Smith on December 3, 1960, at the Fort Bragg army installation in North Carolina, the oldest of three siblings. Her father, Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, attained the rank of colonel and became a military judge. Her Scottish mother, Anne (n√©e Love; 1940‚Äì2009), was a psychologist and social worker from Greenock, Scotland, who immigrated to the United States in 1951 with her family.Finding Your Roots, February 9, 2016, PBS Moore has a younger sister, Valerie Smith, and a younger brother, the novelist Peter Moore Smith. As Moore is half-Scottish, she claimed British citizenship in 2011 to honor her deceased mother. The Huntington Avenue Theatre, formerly of Boston University, where Moore trained to be an actress Moore frequently moved around the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. Stated by Moore in this interview. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: \\"When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was ... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change.\\" When Moore was 16, the family moved from Falls Church, Virginia, where Moore had been attending J.E.B. Stuart High School, to Frankfurt, West Germany, where she attended Frankfurt American High School. She was clever and studious, a self-proclaimed \\"good girl\\", and she planned to become a doctor. She had never considered performing, or even attended the theatre, but she was an avid reader and it was this hobby that led her to begin acting at the school. She appeared in several plays, including Tartuffe and Medea, and with the encouragement of her English teacher, she chose to pursue a theatrical career.Rozen, Leah (April 2012). \\"Moore than Meets the Eye\\". More. pp. 72‚Äì75, 88. Moore's parents supported her decision, but asked that she train at university to provide the added security of a college degree. She was accepted to Boston University and graduated with a BFA in Theatre in 1983. Acting career =Early roles (1985‚Äì1993)= Moore moved to New York City after graduating, and worked as a waitress. After registering her stage name with Actors' Equity, she began her career in 1985 with off-Broadway theatre. Her first screen role came in 1985, in an episode of the soap opera The Edge of Night. Her break came the following year, when she joined the cast of As the World Turns. Playing the dual roles of half- sisters Frannie and Sabrina Hughes, she found this intensive work to be an important learning experience, and she said of it fondly: \\"I gained confidence and learned to take responsibility.\\" Moore performed on the show until 1988, when she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series. Before leaving As the World Turns, she had a role in the 1987 CBS miniseries I'll Take Manhattan. Once she finished her contract at World Turns, she played Ophelia in a Guthrie Theater production of Hamlet opposite ≈Ωeljko Ivanek. The actress returned intermittently to television over the next three years, appearing in the TV movies Money, Power, Murder (1989), The Last to Go (1991), and Cast a Deadly Spell (1991). In 1990, Moore began working with stage director Andre Gregory on a workshop theatre production of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. Described by Moore as \\"one of the most fundamentally important acting experiences I ever had\\", the group spent four years exploring the text and giving intimate performances to friends. Also in 1990, Moore made her cinematic debut as a mummy's victim in Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, a low-budget horror that she later described as \\"terrible\\". Her next film role, in 1992, introduced her to a wide audience. The thriller The Hand That Rocks the Cradle ‚Äì in which she played the main character's ill-fated friend ‚Äì was number one at the US box office, and Moore caught the attention of several critics with her performance. She followed it the same year with the crime comedy The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag, appearing as the protagonist's kooky sister. Moore continued to play supporting roles throughout 1993, first featuring in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence as Madonna's love rival. The film was a failure and widely mocked, and she later regretted her involvement. She had greater success in a 1993 romantic comedy with Johnny Depp. In Benny & Joon, she played a gentle waitress who falls for Aidan Quinn's character, Benny. Moore also appeared briefly as a doctor in one of the year's biggest hits, the Harrison Ford thriller The Fugitive. =Rise to fame (1993‚Äì1997)= Robert Altman, who gave Moore her breakthrough role in Short Cuts (1993) The filmmaker Robert Altman saw Moore in the Uncle Vanya production, and was sufficiently impressed to cast her in his next project: the ensemble drama Short Cuts (1993), based on short stories by Raymond Carver. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film 3 Women (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when she saw it in college.Haskell, Molly (August 2010). \\"Julianne\\", Town & Country. pp. 79‚Äì82. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a \\"total unknown\\" surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore's breakout role.Haramis, Nick (March 2012). \\"Julie and Julianne\\". BlackBook. pp. 50‚Äì57. Variety magazine described her as \\"arresting\\" and noted that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would \\"no doubt be the most discussed scene\\" of the film. Short Cuts was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globe Awards. Moore received an individual nomination for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety. Short Cuts was one of a trio of successive film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It was followed in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as \\"simply outstanding\\" by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe \\"first established [Moore's] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation\\". The film historian David Thomson later described it as \\"one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s\\", and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, \\"They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing.\\" Moore's next appearance was a supporting role in the comedy-drama Roommates (1995), playing the daughter-in-law of Peter Falk. Her following film, Nine Months (1995), was crucial in establishing her as a leading lady in Hollywood. The romantic comedy, directed by Chris Columbus and co-starring Hugh Grant, was poorly reviewed, but a box office success; it remains one of her highest-grossing films. Her next release was also a Hollywood production, as Moore appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas in the thriller Assassins (1995). Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide. Moore's only appearance of 1996 came in the Merchant Ivory film Surviving Picasso, where she played the artist Dora Maar opposite Anthony Hopkins. The period drama met with poor reviews. A key point in Moore's career came when she was cast by Steven Spielberg to star as paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in The Lost World: Jurassic Park ‚Äì the sequel to his 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself \\"tremendously\\". It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, \\"There was so much hanging everywhere. We hung off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things ... it was just non-stop.\\" The Lost World (1997) finished as one of the ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: \\"Suddenly I had a commercial film career\\", she said. The Myth of Fingerprints was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy Chicago Cab. =Worldwide recognition (1997‚Äì2002)= The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Moore achieve significant industry recognition. Her first Academy Award nomination came for the critically acclaimed Boogie Nights (1997), which centers on a group of individuals working in the 1970s pornography industry. Director Paul Thomas Anderson was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Moore agreed to the film after being impressed with his \\"exhilarating\\" script. The ensemble piece featured Moore as Amber Waves, a leading porn actress and mother-figure who longs to be re-united with her real son. Martyn Glanville of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of confidence and vulnerability, and was impressed with Moore's effort. Time Out called the performance \\"superb\\", while Janet Maslin of The New York Times found it \\"wonderful\\". Alongside her Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Moore was nominated at the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards, and several critics groups named her a winner. Moore played Maude Lebowski in the cult Coen brothers film The Big Lebowski (1998). She is seen here with co-star Jeff Bridges at the 2011 Lebowski Fest. Moore followed her success in Boogie Nights with a role in the Coen brothers' dark comedy The Big Lebowski (1998). The film was not a hit at the time of release, but subsequently became a cult classic. Her role was Maude Lebowski, a feminist artist and daughter of the eponymous character who becomes involved with \\"The Dude\\" (Jeff Bridges, the film's star). At the end of 1998, Moore had a flop with Gus Van Sant's Psycho, a remake of the classic Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name. She played Lila Crane in the film, which received poor reviews and is described by The Guardian as one of her \\"pointless\\" outings. The review in Boxoffice magazine regretted that \\"a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives\\" on the film. After re-uniting with Robert Altman for the dark comedy Cookie's Fortune (1999), Moore starred in An Ideal Husband ‚Äì Oliver Parker's adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play. Set in London at the end of the 19th century, her performance of Mrs. Laura Cheverly earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. She was also nominated in the Drama category that year for her work in The End of the Affair (1999). Based on the novel by Graham Greene, Moore played opposite Ralph Fiennes as an adulterous wife in 1940s Britain. The critic Michael Sragow was full of praise for her work, writing that her performance was \\"the critical element that makes [the film] necessary viewing\\". Moore received her second Academy Award nomination for the role ‚Äì her first for Best Actress ‚Äì as well as nominations at the British Academy (BAFTA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards. In between her two Golden Globe-nominated performances, Moore was seen in A Map of the World, supporting Sigourney Weaver, as a bereaved mother. Her fifth and final film of 1999 was the acclaimed drama Magnolia, a \\"giant mosaic\\" chronicling the lives of multiple characters over one day in Los Angeles. Paul Thomas Anderson, in his follow-up to Boogie Nights, wrote a role specifically for Moore. His primary objective was to \\"see her explode\\", and he cast her as a morphine- addicted wife. Moore has said it was a particularly difficult role, but she was rewarded with a SAG nomination. She was subsequently named Best Supporting Actress of 1999 by the National Board of Review, in recognition of her three performances in Magnolia, An Ideal Husband, and A Map of the World. Apart from a cameo role in the comedy The Ladies Man, Moore's only other appearance in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she was not interested in upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest- grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science-fiction-comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received. The year 2002 marked a high point in Moore's career, as she became the ninth performer to be nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year. She received a Best Actress nomination for the melodrama Far from Heaven, in which she played a 1950s housewife whose world is shaken when her husband reveals he is gay. The role was written specifically for her by Todd Haynes, the first time the pair had worked together since Safe, and Moore described it as \\"a very, very personal project ... such an incredible honor to do\\". David Rooney of Variety praised her \\"beautifully gauged performance\\" of a desperate woman \\"buckling under social pressures and putting on a brave face\\". Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters of what we call great acting that it nearly defies categorization\\". The role won Moore the Best Actress award from 19 different organizations, including the Venice Film Festival and the National Board of Review. Moore's second Oscar nomination that year came for The Hours, which she co-starred in with Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep. She again played a troubled 1950s housewife, prompting Kenneth Turan to write that she was \\"essentially reprising her Far from Heaven role\\". Moore said it was an \\"unfortunate coincidence\\" that the similar roles came at the same time, and claimed that the characters had differing personalities. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the performance \\"wrenching\\", while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised a \\"superbly controlled, humane performance\\". The Hours was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Moore also received BAFTA and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and was jointly awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress with Kidman and Streep at the Berlin Film Festival. =Established actress (2003‚Äì2009)= Moore at a festival for Jerrold Nadler in 2007 Moore did not make any screen appearances in 2003, but returned in 2004, with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: Marie and Bruce, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, did not get a cinematic release; Laws of Attraction followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with The Forgotten, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one. In 2005, Moore worked with her husband for the third time in the comedy Trust the Man, and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio. Her first release of 2006 was Freedomland, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The response was overwhelmingly negative, but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Children of Men (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade. Moore made her Broadway debut in the world premiere of David Hare's play The Vertical Hour. The production, directed by Sam Mendes and co-starring Bill Nighy, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq challenged. Ben Brantley of The New York Times was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the \\"tough, assertive\\" quality that Nadia required. David Rooney of Variety criticized her \\"lack of stage technique\\", adding that she appeared \\"stiffly self-conscious\\". Moore later confessed that she found performing on Broadway difficult and had not connected with the medium, but was glad to have experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances. Moore played an FBI agent for the second time in Next (2007), a science fiction action film co-starring Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the response from critics was highly negative. Manohla Dargis wrote, \\"Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to be here, and it's no wonder.\\" The actress has since described it as her worst film. Next was followed by Savage Grace (2007), the true story of Barbara Daly Baekeland ‚Äì a high-society mother whose Oedipal relationship with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. Savage Grace had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a \\"coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie\\". Moore at the 66th Venice Film Festival, 2009, with A Single Man co-star Colin Firth I'm Not There (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film explored the life of Bob Dylan, with Moore playing a character based on Joan Baez. In 2008, she starred with Mark Ruffalo in Blindness, a dystopian thriller from the director Fernando Meirelles. The film was not widely seen, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new releases. She had a supporting role in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, and then starred in the erotic thriller Chloe with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the well-received drama A Single Man. Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film starred Colin Firth as a homosexual professor who wishes to end his life. Moore played his best friend, \\"a fellow English expat and semi-alcoholic divorcee\\", a character that Tom Ford, the film's writer- director, created with her in mind. Leslie Felperin of Variety commented that it was Moore's best role in \\"some time\\", and was impressed by the \\"extraordinary emotional nuance\\" of her performance. A Single Man was selected as one of the top 10 films of 2009 by the American Film Institute, and Moore received a fifth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film. =Television and comedy (2010‚Äì2013)= Moore returned to television for the first time in 18 years when she played a guest role in the fourth season of 30 Rock. She appeared in five episodes of the Emmy-winning comedy, playing Nancy Donovan, a love interest for Alec Baldwin's character Jack Donaghy. She later appeared in the series finale in January 2013. She also returned to As the World Turns as Frannie Hughes, making a brief cameo appearance in a scene with her character's family near the end of the show's run in 2010. Her first big- screen appearance of the new decade was Shelter (2010), a film described as \\"heinous\\" by Tim Robey of The Telegraph. The psychological thriller received negative reviews and did not have a U.S. release until 2013 (retitled 6 Souls). Moore next starred with Annette Bening in the independent film The Kids Are All Right (2010), a comedy-drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer-director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress was drawn to the film's \\"universal\\" depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. The Kids Are All Right was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an \\"existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty\\", writing, \\"There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera ‚Äì sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally ... and Moore plays every note perfectly.\\" The Kids Are All Right earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress. For her next project, Moore actively looked for another comedy. She had a supporting role in Crazy, Stupid, Love, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film Game Change, a dramatization of Sarah Palin's 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although the response to the film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore's performance. For the first time in her career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award. Moore made two film appearances in 2012. The drama Being Flynn, in which she supported Robert De Niro, had a limited release. Greater success came for What Maisie Knew, the story of a young girl caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. Adapted from Henry James's novel and updated to the 21st century, the drama earned near-universal critical praise. The role of Susanna, Maisie's rock-star mother, required Moore to sing on camera, which was a challenge she embraced despite finding it embarrassing. She called Susanna a terrible parent, but said the role did not make her uncomfortable, as she fully compartmentalized the character: \\"I know that that's not me\\". Following her well-received performance in What Maisie Knew, Moore began 2013 with a supporting role in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's comedy Don Jon, playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that Moore was a key factor in its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy The English Teacher (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother Margaret White in Carrie, an adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel. Coming 37 years after Brian De Palma's well-known take on the book, Moore stated that she wanted to make the role her own. By drawing on King's writing rather than the 1976 film, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that she managed to \\"[suggest] a history ‚Äì one never told, just hinted at ‚Äì of serious damage in [Margaret's] past\\". Although the film was a box office success, it was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation. =Awards success and film series (2014‚Äì2017)= Moore at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where she won the Best Actress prize for Maps to the Stars At age 53, Moore enjoyed a considerable degree of critical and commercial success in 2014. Her first release of the year came alongside Liam Neeson in the action-thriller Non-Stop, set aboard an airplane. The response to the film was mixed, but it earned $223 million worldwide. She followed this by winning the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance as Havana Segrand, an aging actress receiving psychotherapy in David Cronenberg's black comedy Maps to the Stars. Described by The Guardian as a \\"grotesque, gaudy, and ruthless\\" character, Moore based her role on \\"an amalgam of Hollywood casualties she ha[d] encountered\\", and drew upon her early experiences in the industry. Peter Debruge of Variety criticized the film, but found Moore to be \\"incredible\\" and \\"fearless\\" in it. Moore's success at Cannes made her the second actress in history, after Juliette Binoche, to win Best Actress awards at the \\"Big Three\\" film festivals (Berlin, Cannes, and Venice). She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Moore played the supporting role of President Alma Coin, the leader of a rebellion against The Capitol, in the third installment of the lucrative The Hunger Games film series, Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1. The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final appearance of 2014 was one of the most acclaimed of her career. In the drama Still Alice, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer's Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was \\"extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence\\", while according to Kenneth Turan, she was \\"especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out\\". Several critics commented that it was her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA for Best Actress, and, after five nominations, won the Oscar for Best Actress. Moore began 2015 by appearing as an evil queen in Seventh Son, a poorly received fantasy-adventure film co-starring Jeff Bridges. She also appeared opposite Ellen Page in Freeheld, a drama based on a true story about a detective and her same-sex partner, and in the romantic comedy Maggie's Plan, with Greta Gerwig and Ethan Hawke. Both films were presented at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival in September 2015. In Maggie's Plan, Moore played a pretentious Danish professor, a comic role which critic Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair deemed as the film's \\"chief pleasure\\". Later that year, she reprised her role as Alma Coin in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 2, the final film of the series. Moore at an event for Suburbicon in 2017 After a one-year absence from the screen, Moore had three film releases in 2017. She appeared in a dual role in Wonderstruck, a film adaptation of Brian Selznick's historical children's novel of the same name, which reteamed her with Todd Haynes. Her parts were of a silent movie star in the 1920s and a deaf librarian in the 1970s; in preparation, she studied sign language and watched the films of Lillian Gish. Richard Lawson considered her to be \\"eminently watchable\\" despite her limited screen time. Moore portrayed a dual role for the second time that year in Suburbicon, a satirical thriller written by the Coen brothers and directed by George Clooney. She was cast opposite Matt Damon as twin sisters in 1950s America, named Rose and Margaret, who become embroiled in a local crime. The film received negative reviews, with critics saying it failed to effectively portray American racism, but Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent praised Moore for giving \\"a perfectly judged comic performance as a Barbara Stanwyck-like femme fatale\\". Moore's final release of the year was the sequel to the 2015 spy film Kingsman: The Secret Service, subtitled The Golden Circle, co- starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Channing Tatum, and Halle Berry. She played the part of the villainous entrepreneur Poppy Adams, who runs a drug cartel. Despite her character's actions, Moore played the part to make Poppy seem \\"strange, but reasonable\\". Peter Debruge described the film as \\"outlandish\\", and wrote that Moore had played her part \\"as Martha Stewart crossed with a demonic 1950s housewife\\". The film earned over $410 million worldwide. =Independent films (2018‚Äìpresent)= Moore had two films that premiered in 2018. She was drawn to Sebasti√°n Lelio's Gloria Bell, an English- language remake of Lelio's own Chilean film Gloria, for its rare depiction of a middle-age woman's quest for meaning in life. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter believed that she had delivered \\"an utterly natural and quietly spellbinding star performance\\". Her second film that year was Bel Canto, a thriller based on Ann Patchett's novel of the same name about the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. For her performance as an opera singer, she learned to mimic the body language of professionals for scenes in which Ren√©e Fleming performed the vocals. Guy Lodge of the Chicago Tribune deemed the film an unsuccessful adaptation of the novel and considered Moore's work to be \\"edgeless fare by her standards\\". The following year, she teamed with her husband once again in After the Wedding, a remake of Susanne Bier's Danish film of the same name. It featured her and Michelle Williams in roles played by men in the original film. That same year, she starred in The Staggering Girl, a short film directed by Luca Guadagnino. Moore began 2020 by portraying the feminist icon Gloria Steinem in the biopic The Glorias, sharing the part with the actresses Alicia Vikander and Lulu Wilson. She will then next in Joe Wright's thriller The Woman in the Window, based on the novel of the same name, co-starring Amy Adams and Gary Oldman, and in Lisey's Story, an Apple TV+ miniseries adapted from Stephen King's thriller novel of the same name. Moore has also committed to portray Joy Mothertrucker, an ice road trucker, in Jill Soloway's biopic Mothertrucker and to a supporting role in Stephen Chbosky's musical Dear Evan Hansen.https://deadline.com/2020/09/julianne- moore-universals-dear-evan-hansen-movie-1203028675/ Reception and acting style Moore has been described in the media as one of the most talented and accomplished actresses of her generation. As a woman in her 50s, she is unusual in being an older actress who continues to work regularly and in prominent roles. She enjoys the variety of appearing in both low-budget independent films and large-scale Hollywood productions. In 2004, an IGN journalist wrote of this \\"rare ability to bounce between commercially viable projects like Nine Months to art house masterpieces like Safe unscathed\\", adding, \\"She is respected in art houses and multiplexes alike.\\" She is noted for playing in a range of material, and the director Ridley Scott, who worked with Moore on Hannibal, has praised her versatility. In October 2013, Moore was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has been included in People magazine's annual beauty lists on four occasions (1995, 2003, 2008, 2013). In 2015, Time magazine named Moore one of the 100 most influential people in the world on the annual Time 100 list. Moore is particularly known for playing troubled women, and specializes in \\"ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions\\". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically \\"struggling to maintain a purchase on normality in the face of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure\\". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of \\"characters in a state of alienation ... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question.\\" Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a \\"trademark moment\\" in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the \\"queen of the big-screen breakdown\\". \\"When she does finally crack\\", writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, \\"it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore.\\" Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is \\"peerless\\" in her \\"portraits of troubled womanhood\\". When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is \\"a bit of a bore\\". \\"Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty\\", he says, \\"and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of.\\" An interest in portraying \\"actual human drama\\" has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly moved by the concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because \\"we're just not very often in that position in our lives\\". Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to be praised for her \\"fearless\\" performances and for taking on difficult roles. When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, \\"Nothing within the realm of human behavior.\\" She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes, although she has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role. Regarding her approach to acting, Moore said in a 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: \\"I want to have a sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera.\\" The aim, she said, is to \\"try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [happen] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it ... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding.\\" Writing Moore at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival Alongside her acting work, Moore has established a career as a children's author. Her first book, Freckleface Strawberry, was published in October 2007 and became a New York Times Best Seller. Described by Time Out as a \\"simple, sweet and semi- autobiographical narrative\\", it tells the story of a girl who wishes to be rid of her freckles, but eventually accepts them. Moore decided to write the book when her young son began disliking aspects of his appearance; she was reminded of her own childhood, when she was teased for having freckles and called \\"Freckleface Strawberry\\" by other children. The book has turned into a series with six follow-ups : Freckleface Strawberry and the Dodgeball Bully was published in 2009, and Freckleface Strawberry: Best Friends Forever in 2011. Both carry the message that children can overcome their own problems. Freckleface Strawberry: Backpacks!, Freckleface Strawberry: Lunch, or What's That? and Freckleface Strawberry: Loose Tooth! were released as part of Random House publisher's \\"Step Into Reading\\" program. These were followed by Freckleface Strawberry and the Really Big Voice in summer 2016. Freckleface Strawberry has been adapted into a musical, written by Rose Caiola and Gary Kupper, which premiered at the New World Stages, New York, in October 2010. Moore had an input in the production, particularly through requesting that it retain the book's young target audience. The show has since been licensed and performed at several venues, which she calls \\"extremely gratifying and extremely flattering\\". Moore has written one children's book separate from the Freckleface Strawberry series. Released in 2013, My Mom is a Foreigner, But Not to Me is based on her experiences of growing up with a mother from another country. The book had a negative reception from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews; while recognizing it as well-intentioned, Moore's use of verse and rhyme was criticized. Personal life Moore at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival Actor and stage director John Gould Rubin was Moore's first husband, whom she met in 1984 and married two years later. They separated in 1993, and their divorce was finalized in August 1995. \\"I got married too early and I really didn't want to be there\\", she has since explained. Moore began a relationship with Bart Freundlich, her director on The Myth of Fingerprints, in 1996. The couple have a son, Caleb Freundlich (born December 1997) and a daughter, Liv Freundlich (born April 2002). They wed in August 2003 and live in Greenwich Village, New York City. Moore has commented, \\"We have a very solid family life, and it is the most satisfying thing I have ever done.\\" She tries to keep her family close when working and picks material that is practical for her as a parent. Moore is politically liberal and supported Barack Obama at the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. She is a pro-choice activist and sits on the board of advocates for Planned Parenthood. She is also a campaigner for gay rights and gun control and, since 2008, she has been an Artist Ambassador for Save the Children. Moore is a supporter of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students in Parkland, Florida, who organized the March For Our Lives. She also helped release a music video for the group. Moore is an atheist; when asked on Inside the Actors Studio what God might say to her upon arrival in heaven, she gave God's response as, \\"Well, I guess you were wrong, I do exist.\\" She works with Everytown for Gun Safety.

She is the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit and elder sister of King Vajiralongkorn. In 1972, she married American citizen Peter Ladd Jensen and settled in the United States, losing her royal title in the process. The couple divorced in 1998, whereupon she resumed her royal duties and position within the Thai court. She is styled in English as Princess Ubol Ratana, without the style Her Royal Highness. In 2001, she permanently returned to Thailand after a series of visits in the years following her divorce. Almost immediately, she began to fulfill her royal duties by taking part in many ceremonies. She started many charitable foundations that focused on improving the quality of life for the disadvantaged. In February 2019, in an \\"unprecedented\\" move, Ubol Ratana announced her candidacy for Prime Minister of Thailand in the 2019 general election, running as a candidate of the Thai Raksa Chart Party. Later that same day, her younger brother King Vajiralongkorn issued an emergency royal decree stating that her candidacy is \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\". Thailand‚Äôs election commission then disqualified her from running for prime minister, formally putting an end to her candidacy. Early life Princess Ubol Ratana Rajakanya is the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. She was born on 5 April 1951, at Clinique de Montchoisi in Lausanne, Switzerland. Ubol Ratana, part of her royal name, means \\"glass lotus\\", a reference to her maternal grandmother, Bua (\\"lotus\\") Kitiyakara. Her parents nicknamed her \\"Pay\\", short for poupee (French for \\"doll\\"). To her family she is known as Phi Ying. In the media and by Thai people in general, she is called Thun Kramom, a title identifying the daughter of a reigning queen. She returned to Thailand and stayed at Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, Dusit Palace. She was styled \\"Her Royal Highness\\" by her father at the royal celebration of the first month birthday ceremony (Phra Ratchaphithi Somphot Duean Lae Khuen Phra U; ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ò‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏°‡πÇ‡∏†‡∏ä‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏Ç‡∏∂‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏π‡πà) King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave her full name and title \\"Her Royal Highness Princess Ubol Ratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi\\". Ubol Ratana was Bhumibol's favorite child because she was attractive and excelled at academics and sports, where her brother, Vajiralongkorn did not. The king greatly enjoyed playing tennis and badminton with her. This was partly due to his suspicion that others were not trying their hardest when playing sports with him and he admired Ubol Ratana for always trying her best. In the 1967 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games (today called the \\"Southeast Asian Games\\") held in Bangkok, the king and the princess competed in the OK Dinghy sailing class and won gold medals for Thailand. Their participation was conceived by Air Chief Marshal Davee Chullasap who wanted Bhumibol to be seen excelling in sports, much like a Norwegian king who won a gold Olympics medal. During the race, Ubol Ratana was ahead and the king was trailing behind. Davee feared that this would tarnish the king's prestige, but ultimately the king won the race and the father and daughter shared the medal. Education Ubol Ratana attended primary to secondary levels at Chitralada School. She went to the United States for her tertiary education. She studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1973. She later obtained a master's degree in public health at University of California, Los Angeles. Marriage and family While studying at university, Ubol Ratana dated an American, Peter Ladd Jensen. The palace discovered this, and her parents strongly opposed their relationship. The princess refused to conform to their wishes; on 25 July 1972, she married Jensen. According to Paul M. Handley's biography of Bhumibol, the king became furious at Ubol Ratana and stripped her of her royal title. Ubol Ratana made many attempts to ask her father to reinstate her royal title before and after her permanent return to Thailand, but the king never relented. The princess lived in the United States with her husband for over 26 years and took the name \\"Mrs. Julie Jensen\\". After years of rumoured marital problems, they divorced in 1998. Ubol Ratana and her children continued to reside in San Diego until 2001, when they returned to Thailand. The couple had three children, two daughters and a son, all born in the United States: * Than Phu Ying Ploypailin Mahidol Jensen (born 12 February 1981) married David Wheeler on 25 August 2009, and has three children. * Khun Bhumi Jensen (affectionately known as Khun Poom) (16 August 1983 ‚Äì 26 December 2004), who had autism, died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Princess Ubol Ratana established the Khun Poom Foundation in his memory, to aid children with autism and other learning disabilities. *Than Phu Ying Sirikitiya Mai Jensen (born 18 March 1985) holds a degree in history. While Ubol Ratana remained in the US, her mother (Queen Sirikit) and other members of the royal family often flew there for visits. Ubol Ratana likewise flew to Thailand along with her husband to visit her parents and the other members of the royal family, while joining them in royal ceremonies when she visited Thailand. She visited in 1980, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1996, taking part in several family events, before her permanent return in 2001. Charitable work Ubol Ratana launched the \\"To Be Number One\\" Foundation in 2002 to combat drug use by young people. the foundation has more than 31 million members throughout Thailand. She hosts the television show, \\"Talk to the Princess\\" on TVT11 NBT where she promotes the aims of her anti- drug work. Film career In 2003, Ubol Ratana starred in a Thai soap opera, Kasattiya. In 2006 she had a role in Anantalai, a drama series she wrote under the pen name \\"Ploykampetch\\". In 2011, the princess and her daughter Ploypailin Jensen starred in Dao Long Fah, Pupha Si-ngen. Ubol Ratana acted in the Thai movie Where The Miracle Happens (Neung Jai Diaokan) (‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏à..‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô), released on 7 August 2008 (in this film she also participated as a screenwriter). She plays a \\"lonely-at-the-top\\" CEO who begins a life of philanthropy after the death of her only daughter. In 2010, she appeared in the action film My Best Bodyguard (‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏™‡∏ó‡πå‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå‡∏î), released on 21 October 2010. In 2012, she appeared in the romantic film Together (Wan Tee Rak) (‡∏£‡πà‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô), released on 20 December 2012.Imdb Political career In 2019, it was announced Ubol Ratana would run as the prime ministerial candidate for the Thaksin-affiliated Thai Raksa Chart Party in the 2019 general election, called an \\"astonishing\\" move without precedent, as the royal family has never been directly involved in electoral politics. Her candidacy was quickly quashed by her brother, King Rama X, on the grounds that members of the royal family may not overtly participate in politics. After his statement, the Thai Raksa Chart Party withdrew their support for her run. The Election Commission, citing the royal decree, disqualified her. Titles and styles Royal monogram Royal Cypher Flag Ubol Ratana was born with the titles of \\"Her Royal Highness\\" and \\"Princess Chao Fa\\", but gave these up upon her marriage to an American citizen. The title Chao Fa was lost because she married a commoner. She had previously held the royal title Chao Fa Ubol Ratana Rajakanya. She still retains the style of Tunkramom Ying, which means \\"daughter to the queen regent\\". Since her return to Thailand, she has increasingly taken part in royal ceremonies, though not to the extent of her siblings. =Honours= * 80px Dame of The Most Illustrious Order of the Royal House of Chakri * 80px Dame Grand Cross (First Class) of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao * 80px Dame Grand Cordon of The Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant * 80px Dame Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand * 80px King Rama IX Royal Cypher Medal (First Class) * 80px Royal Cypher Medal of King Rama X * 80px Commemorative Medal on the Occasion of the Coronation of H.M.

He was born in Link√∂ping as the son of Thure Theorell and his wife Armida Bill. Theorell went to Secondary School at Katedralskolan in Link√∂ping and passed his examination there on 23 May 1921. In September, he began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute and in 1924 he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine. He then spent three months studying bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris under Professor Albert Calmette. In 1930 he obtained his M.D. degree with a theory on the lipids of the blood plasma, and was appointed professor in physiological chemistry at the Karolinska Institute. Theorell, who dedicated his entire career to enzyme research, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1955 for discovering oxidoreductase enzymes and their effects. His contribution also consisted of the theory of the toxic effects of sodium fluoride on the cofactors of crucial human enzymes. He was a head of research of the Nobel Institute, the first researcher related to the Institute to be awarded a Nobel Prize. His work had led to pioneering progress on ADH enzymes, which break down alcohol in the kidney. His work won praise in Sweden as well as around the world. He received honorary degrees at universities in France, Belgium, Brazil and the United States. Theorell died in Stockholm and is interred in Norra begravningsplatsen (The Northern Cemetery) alongside his wife, Elin Margit Elisabeth (n√©e Alenius) Theorell, a distinguished pianist and harpsichordist who died in 2002.

The case shown has two critical points. Here the function is . In mathematics, a cubic function is a function of the form :f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d where the coefficients , , , and are real numbers, and the variable takes real values, and . In other words, it is both a polynomial function of degree three, and a real function. In particular, the domain and the codomain are the set of the real numbers. Setting produces a cubic equation of the form :ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0, whose solutions are called roots of the function. A cubic function has either one or three real roots; all odd-degree polynomials have at least one real root. The graph of a cubic function always has a single inflection point. It may have two critical points, a local minimum and a local maximum. Otherwise, a cubic function is monotonic. The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point; that is, it is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around this point. Up to an affine transformation, there are only three possible graphs for cubic functions. Cubic functions are fundamental for cubic interpolation. History Critical and inflection points The critical points of a cubic function are its stationary points, that is the points where the slope of the function is zero. Thus the critical points of a cubic function defined by :, occur at values of such that the derivative : 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0 of the cubic function is zero. The solutions of this equation are the -values of the critical points and are given, using the quadratic formula, by :x_\\\\text{critical}=\\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {b^2-3ac}}{3a}. The sign of the expression inside the square root determines the number of critical points. If it is positive, then there are two critical points, one is a local maximum, and the other is a local minimum. If , then there is only one critical point, which is an inflection point. If , then there are no (real) critical points. In the two latter cases, that is, if is nonpositive, the cubic function is strictly monotonic. See the figure for an example of the case . The inflection point of a function is where that function changes concavity. An inflection point occurs when the second derivative f(x) = 6ax + 2b, is zero, and the third derivative is nonzero. Thus a cubic function has always a single inflection point, which occurs at :x_\\\\text{inflection} = -\\\\frac{b}{3a}. Classification similar to such a curve. The graph of a cubic function is a cubic curve, though many cubic curves are not graphs of functions. Although cubic functions depend on four parameters, their graph can have only very few shapes. In fact, the graph of a cubic function is always similar to the graph of a function of the form :y=x^3+px. This similarity can be built as the composition of translations parallel to the coordinates axes, a homothecy (uniform scaling), and, possibly, a reflection (mirror image) with respect to the -axis. A further non-uniform scaling can transform the graph into the graph of one among the three cubic functions :\\\\begin{align} y&=x^3+x\\\\\\\\\\\\ y&=x^3\\\\\\\\\\\\ y&=x^3-x. \\\\end{align} This means that there are only three graphs of cubic functions up to an affine transformation. The above geometric transformations can be built in the following way, when starting from a general cubic function y=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d. Firstly, if , the change of variable allows supposing . After this change of variable, the new graph is the mirror image of the previous one, with respect of the -axis. Then, the change of variable provides a function of the form :y=ax_1^3+px_1+q. This corresponds to a translation parallel to the -axis. The change of variable corresponds to a translation with respect to the -axis, and gives a function of the form :y_1=ax_1^3+px_1. The change of variable \\\\textstyle x_1=\\\\frac {x_2}\\\\sqrt a, y_1=\\\\frac {y_2}\\\\sqrt a corresponds to a uniform scaling, and give, after multiplication by \\\\sqrt a, a function of the form :y_2=x_2^3+px_2, which is the simplest form that can be obtained by a similarity. Then, if , the non-uniform scaling \\\\textstyle x_2=x_3\\\\sqrt{p},\\\\quad y_2=y_3\\\\sqrt{p^3} gives, after division by \\\\textstyle \\\\sqrt{p^3}, :y_3 =x_3^3 + x_3\\\\operatorname{sign}(p), where \\\\operatorname{sign}(p) has the value 1 or ‚Äì1, depending on the sign of . If one defines \\\\operatorname{sign}(0)=0, the latter form of the function applies to all cases (with x_2 = x_3 and y_2 = y_3). Symmetry For a cubic function of the form y=x^3+px, the inflection point is thus the origin. As such a function is an odd function, its graph is symmetric with respect to the inflection point, and invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point. As these properties are invariant by similarity, the following is true for all cubic functions. The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point, and is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point. Collinearities The points , , and (in blue) are collinear and belong to the graph of . The points , , and (in red) are the intersections of the (dotted) tangent lines to the graph at these points with the graph itself. They are collinear too. The tangent lines to the graph of a cubic function at three collinear points intercept the cubic again at collinear points. This can be seen as follows. As this property is invariant under a rigid motion, one may suppose that the function has the form :f(x)=x^3+px. If is a real number, then the tangent to the graph of at the point is the line :}. So, the intersection point between this line and the graph of can be obtained solving the equation , that is :x^3+px=\\\\alpha^3+p\\\\alpha+ (x-\\\\alpha)(3\\\\alpha^2+p), which can be rewritten :x^3 - 3\\\\alpha^2 x +2\\\\alpha^3=0, and factorized as :(x-\\\\alpha)^2(x+2\\\\alpha)=0. So, the tangent intercepts the cubic at :(-2\\\\alpha, -8\\\\alpha^3-2p\\\\alpha)=(-2\\\\alpha, -8f(\\\\alpha)-10p\\\\alpha). So, the function that maps a point of the graph to the other point where the tangent intercepts the graph is :(x,y)\\\\mapsto (-2x, -8y-10px). This is an affine transformation that transforms collinear points into collinear points. This proves the claimed result. Cubic interpolation Given the values of a function and its derivative at two points, there is exactly one cubic function that has the same four values, which is called a cubic Hermite spline. There are two standard ways for using this fact. Firstly, if one knows, for example by physical measurement, the values of a function and its derivative at some sampling points, one can interpolate the function with a continuously differentiable function, which is a piecewise cubic function. If the value of a function is known at several points, cubic interpolation consists in approximating the function by a continuously differentiable function, which is piecewise cubic. For having a uniquely defined interpolation, two more constraints must be added, such as the values of the derivatives at the endpoints, or a zero curvature at the endpoints.

The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. In early years the band's recordings were all released on the small Boston- based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, Vs. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded four more albums, ONoffON, The Obliterati, The Sound The Speed The Light and Unsound. History =Formation and early history= Mission of Burma's history began with a short-lived Boston rock group called Moving Parts. The band included Roger Miller, who had moved to Boston from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Clint Conley, who came from Darien, Connecticut.Azerrad, 2001. p. 96 When Moving Parts broke up amicably in December 1978, Miller and Conley began practicing. Auditioning new drummers was accomplished, as Michael Azzerad puts it, \\"by playing 'out' music, such as Sun Ra and James Brown, until the applicant left.\\"Azerrad, 2001. They eventually recruited ex-Molls drummer Peter Prescott, who had admired the music of Moving Parts.Azerrad, 2001. p. 97 They took their name from a \\"Mission of Burma\\" plaque Conley saw on a New York City diplomatic building; he thought the phrase had a \\"sort of murky and disturbing\\" quality. Mission of Burma made their debut on April 1, 1979 as a trio, performing at The Modern Theater. Later that month Miller wrote a song, \\"Nu Disco\\", that he felt would be improved by a tape loop.Azerrad, 2001. p. 98 Miller then contacted Martin Swope, with whom he had earlier written some John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen-inspired pieces for piano and tape. Swope was immediately enlisted as the group's live audio engineer and occasional tape- effects artist. His latter role grew gradually, until by 1981 he was adding tape work to most of the group's songs, and was regarded as an integral part of the group, appearing in group photographs and receiving equal credit on recordings. From the start, Mission of Burma received support from local music magazine Boston Rock, which printed a lengthy interview with the band before they released their first record, and MIT community radio station WMBR. The station played Conley's \\"Peking Spring\\" repeatedly, and it became the station's most-played song of 1979. Mission of Burma wanted to release the song as a single, but by the time they had found a label, they felt the song had run its course.Azerrad, 2001. p. 99 =Signals and Vs.= By 1981, the band signed a record deal with the Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Their debut single was Conley's \\"Academy Fight Song\\", with Miller's \\"Max Ernst\\" (titled after the dada artist) as the B-side. Rick Harte's layered production was far more refined than the band's ragged live performances, and the band initially objected to the single. However, the first pressing of the single sold out quickly, and the band thereafter trusted Harte's judgment. Their debut release, the EP Signals, Calls, and Marches, was released in 1981. By the end of that year, the EP had sold out its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. In 1982, Mission of Burma released their first full-length album, Vs.. The album has since seen wide praise; one review notes \\"very few American bands from the 1980s released an album as ambitious or as powerful as Vs., and it still sounds like a classic\\". =Breakup and aftermath= In 1983, after the release of Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus, attributed in large part to their notoriously loud live performances‚Äîduring their farewell tour, Miller took to augmenting his usual small foam earplugs with rifle-range earphones onstage. A live compilation, The Horrible Truth About Burma, was assembled of recordings from the farewell tour and released on Ace of Hearts in 1985. In 1988, Rykodisc released a compilation album, Mission of Burma, the first compact disc to exceed 80 minutes of playing time. Miller and Swope then turned their attention to their side project, the quieter Birdsongs Of The Mesozoic (co-founded with their old friend Erik Lindgren, who had played with Miller and Conley in Moving Parts), which they both left in the 1990s, Miller to produce several solo efforts and film scores, and Swope to semi-reclusion in Hawaii. Prescott remained active in the Boston music scene, forming Volcano Suns and later Kustomized and The Peer Group. Other than producing Yo La Tengo's debut record, Conley dropped out of music (working as a producer for Boston television station WCVB's newsmagazine Chronicle); in 2001 he returned with Consonant. =Reunion= While disbanded, Mission of Burma accrued a larger fanbase. In the 1980s and 90s, Taang! Records and Rykodisc kept the band's music in print via reissues of the Ace of Hearts catalog as well as unreleased recordings. Mission of Burma was also one of the 13 groups featured in Michael Azerrad's book Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981‚Äì1991, marking them as an iconic group in the American indie rock canon. In 2002, Mission of Burma reunited but without Swope as he declined to join. Conley, Miller and Prescott instead played reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that \\"when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.\\" Weston began using a digital looping box from Electro-Harmonix in 2007 during live performances, but still uses actual tape loops in the studio. Weston regularly joins the band onstage during encores, playing bass while Conley plays second guitar. The band initially planned on playing just two reunion gigs, one in Boston and another in New York. When tickets sold out very quickly and concert dates expanded to two nights in New York and three in Boston, Mission of Burma decided to re-form more permanently to tour and record new material. A new album, ONoffON, was produced in 2004 by Weston with Rick Harte and the band, and released by Matador Records in May. The album finished 90th in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critic's poll. They also released Snapshot, a live recording of the reunited lineup, through online digital channels. In September 2005, the band returned to the studio with Weston for an album tentatively titled (among other names) Aluminum Washcloth and rechristened The Obliterati. Released in May 2006, again on Matador, it ranked #33 of best records of 2006 by Pitchfork Media and placed 50th in the Pazz & Jop poll. In 2006, a documentary about the band was released entitled Not a Photograph: The Mission of Burma Story. In March 2008, Matador re- released remastered versions of Signals, Calls, and Marches, Vs., and The Horrible Truth About Burma from the band's original era. In a September 2008 interview with the L.A. RECORD, Prescott explained that the sheer physical exertion involved in performing Mission of Burma songs meant that the band could only play together for a \\"couple more years at most.\\" In March 2009 the band recorded 14 tracks for their fourth full-length studio album, The Sound The Speed The Light. Matador released a two non-album songs on a 7‚Ä≥ single in August and the full album in October.Fenway Recordings Press Release, May 4 In January 2012, Mission of Burma parted ways with Matador and recorded their fifth full-length album, Unsound, for Fire Records. The album saw release in July 2012, preceded by the single \\"Dust Devil\\". In a June 2019 Facebook post, it was revealed that the band has no plans to make further albums. As of June 2020, the band was officially finished. Musical style Miller's songs were typically more unorthodox, both lyrically and structurally. Critic Franklin Bruno described Conley as a \\"hook machine\\". \\"That's When I Reach for My Revolver\\" has been covered by Moby, Graham Coxon, and Catherine Wheel. Though Miller and Conley handled most of the singing and songwriting, Prescott contributes a few songs per record as well. Live performances Prescott explained Swope's methods in a 1997 interview: \\"What Martin did ... was tape something that was going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there.\\" Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's \\"That's When I Reach For My Revolver\\"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's \\"Red\\"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: \\"A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments.\\" Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores. Their live performances were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: \\"When they were good, they were very very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that was the nature of the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether you were going to get one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or if it was going to be a ball of incomprehensible noise.\\" Azerrad, 2001. p. 106 While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well- constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from \\"Secrets\\" as a frequent opener and \\"All World Cowboy Romance\\" or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.

Skaldic poetry forms one of two main groupings of Old Norse poetry, the other being the anonymous Eddic poetry. The most prevalent metre of skaldic poetry is dr√≥ttkv√¶tt. The subject is usually historical and encomiastic, detailing the deeds of the skald's patron. There is no evidence that the skalds employed musical instruments, but some speculate that they may have accompanied their verses with the harp or lyre. The corpus of skaldic poetry comprise 5797 verses by 447 skalds preserved in 718 manuscripts. It is currently being edited by the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages project. An early modern depiction of Thor's fight with the World Serpent, the subject of early skaldic verses by Bragi Boddason and Ulfr Uggason Etymology The word skald is perhaps ultimately related to (). Old High German has , and . The Old High German variant stem etymologically identical to the skald- stem () means \\"to scold, blame, accuse, insult\\". The person doing the insulting is a or . The West Germanic counterpart of the skald is the . Like the , which is related to Modern English scoff, the name skald is continued in English scold, reflecting the central position of mocking taunts in Germanic poetry. History Skaldic poetry can be traced to the earlier-9th century with Bragi Boddason and his Ragnarsdr√°pa, considered among the oldest surviving Norse poems. Brage is the earliest skald whose verse has survived. However, many skalds came after him, like Egill Skallagr√≠msson and Torbj√∏rn Hornklove (√ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi), who gained much fame in the 10th century for the poems composed for the kings they served of their own exploits. At the time, the Icelanders and Nordic people were still pagan, and their work reflected that by many references to gods like Thor and Odin and to seers and runes. The poetry from then also can be noted for its portrayal of a \\"heroic age\\" for the Vikings and \\"praise poetry, designed to commemorate kings and other prominent people, often in the form of quite long poems.\\" As time went on, skalds became the main source of Icelandic and Norse history and culture, as it was the skalds who learned and shared the largely oral history.The Skalds: A Selection of Their Poems, with Introduction and Notes by Lee M. Hollander Review by H. M. Smyser, ‚ÄúSpeculum,\\" Vol. 21, No. 2 (Apr. 1946), Medieval Academy of America That led to a shift in the role of the skald, allowing them to gain more prominent positions. Every king and chieftain needed a skald to record their feats and ensure their legacy lived on, as well as becoming the main historians of their society. The written artefacts of that time come from skalds, as they were the first from the time and place to record on paper. Some skalds became clerical workers, recording laws and happenings of the government, some even being elected to the Thing and Althing, while others worked with churches to record the lives and miracles of Saints, along with passing on the ideals of Christianity. The last point is very important, as skalds were the main agents of culture when they began glorifying and passing on Christianity over the old pagan beliefs, the Viking culture shifted towards Christianity, as well. Snorri Sturlusonn, illustration by Christian Krohg (1899) As time passed, the skald profession was threatened with extinction until Snorri Sturluson compiled the Prose Edda, as a manual to preserve an appreciative understanding of their art. Snorri, born in Iceland during the 12th century, played a very important part in the history of Skaldic poetry. In addition to being a great poet, he was leader of the Althing for part of his life, leading the government of Iceland. His Prose Edda preserved and passed on the traditions and methods of the Skalds, adding a much needed stimulus to the profession, and providing much of the information now known about skalds and how they worked. For example, the Prose Edda broke down and explained kennings used in skaldic poetry, allowing many of them to be understood today. Beyond writing the Prose Edda, Snorri wrote other important works, from retelling old Norse legends to tales of the exploits of kings, which gave him much fame and made his reputation live on beyond his death. Skaldic poetry Eddic verse was usually simple, in terms of content, style and metre, dealing largely with mythological or heroic content. Skaldic verse, conversely, was complex, and usually composed as a tribute or homage to a particular jarl or king. There is debate over the performance of skaldic poetry, but there is a general scholarly consensus that it was spoken rather than sung. Unlike many other literary forms of the time, much skaldic poetry is attributable to an author (called a skald), and those attributions may be relied on with a reasonable degree of confidence. Many skalds were men of influence and power and so were biographically noted. The metre is ornate, usually dr√≥ttkv√¶tt or a variation thereof. The syntax is complex, with sentences commonly interwoven, with kennings and heiti being used frequently and gratuitously. Skaldic poetry was written in variants and dialects of Old Norse. Technically, the verse was usually a form of alliterative verse and almost always used the dr√≥ttkv√¶tt stanza (also known as the Court or Lordly Metre). Dr√≥ttkv√¶tt is effectively an eight-line form, and each pair of lines is an original single long line which is conventionally written as two lines. =Forms= These are forms of skaldic poetry: * Dr√°pa, a long series of stanzas (usually dr√≥ttkv√¶tt), with a refrain (stef) at intervals. * Flokkr, v√≠sur or dr√¶plingr, a shorter series of such stanzas without refrain. * Lausav√≠sa, a single stanza of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, said to have been improvised impromptu for the occasion that it marks. Skalds also composed insult (n√≠√∞v√≠sur) and very occasionally, erotic verse (mans√∂ngr). =Kennings= The verses of the skalds contain a great profusion of kennings, the fixed metaphors found in most Northern European poetry of the time. Kennings are devices ready to supply a standard image to form an alliterating half-line to fit the requirements of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, but the substantially greater technical demands of skaldic verse required the devices to be multiplied and compounded to meet its demands for skill and wordplay. The images can therefore become somewhat hermetic, at least to those who fail to grasp the allusions that are at the root of many of them. =Skaldic poems= Most skaldic poetry are poems composed to individual kings by their court poets. They typically have historical content, relating battles and other deeds from the king's career. * Glymdr√°pa ‚Äí the deeds of Harald Fairhair. * Vellekla ‚Äí the deeds of Haakon Sigurdsson. * Bandadr√°pa ‚Äí the deeds of Eir√≠kr H√°konarson by Eyj√≥lfr d√°√∞ask√°ld * Kn√∫tsdr√°pa ‚Äí the deeds of Cnut the Great. A few surviving skaldic poems have mythological content. * √û√≥rsdr√°pa ‚Äí a dr√°pa to the god Thor telling the tale of one of his giant-bashing expeditions. * Haustl√∂ng ‚Äí relates two tales from the mythology as painted on a shield given to the poet. * Ragnarsdr√°pa ‚Äí relates four tales from the mythology as painted on a shield given to the poet. * H√∫sdr√°pa ‚Äí describes mythological scenes as carved on kitchen panels. * Ynglingatal ‚Äí describes the origin of the Norwegian kings and the history of the Ynglings. It is preserved in the Heimskringla. To that could be added two poems relating the death of a king and his reception in Valhalla. * H√°konarm√°l ‚Äí the death of king Haakon the Good and his reception in Valhalla. * Eir√≠ksm√°l ‚Äí the death of king Eir√≠kr and his reception in Valhalla. Some other were composed as circumstance pieces, such as those by Egill Skallagr√≠msson * Sonatorrek ‚Äí a lament on the death of Egill's sons. * H√∂fu√∞lausn ‚Äí a praise for Eric Bloodaxe, that saved its author's head. * Arinbjarnarkvi√∞a ‚Äí in praise of the poet's friend Arinbj√∂rn. Notable skalds More than 300 skalds are known from the period between 800 and 1200 AD. Many are listed in the Sk√°ldatal, not all of whom are known from extant material. Notable names include: * Bragi Boddason \\"the Old\\" (early-9th century), author of Ragnarsdr√°pa * √ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi (9th century) court poet of King Harald Fairhair * √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir (fl. c. 900), author of Haustl√∂ng and Ynglingatal * Eyvindr sk√°ldaspillir (10th century), or Eyvindr the Plagiarist, the author of H√°konarm√°l and H√°leygjatal * Egill Skallagr√≠msson (10th century), author of Sonatorrek, H√∂fu√∞lausn and Arinbjarnarkvi√∞a * Korm√°kr √ñgmundarson (mid-10th century), the main character of Korm√°ks saga * Eil√≠fr Go√∞r√∫narson (late-10th century), author of √û√≥rsdr√°pa * √û√≥rvaldr Hjaltason (later-10th century), a skald of king Eric the Victorious * Hallfre√∞r vandr√¶√∞ask√°ld (late-10th century) court poet of Olaf Tryggvason * Einarr Helgason \\"Sk√°laglamm\\" (late-10th century), \\"of the gleaming coins\\" ‚Äí author of Vellekla * √ölfr Uggason (late-10th century), author of the H√∫sdr√°pa * Tindr Hallkelsson (fl. c. 1000), one of Haakon Sigurdsson's court poets * Gunnlaugr Ormstunga (10/11th century), nicknamed Ormstunga \\"Wormtongue\\" on account of his propensity for satire and invective * Sigvatr √û√≥r√∞arson (earlier-11th century), court poet to King Olaf II of Norway * √û√≥rarinn loftunga (earlier-11th century) court poet to Sveinn Kn√∫tsson * √ìttarr svarti (earlier-11th century), a skald at the court of king Olof Sk√∂tkonung and Olaf the Stout * Arn√≥rr jarlask√°ld (mid-11th century), Jarlaskald \\"the Earls' Skald\\" * Einarr Sk√∫lason (12th century), author of Geisli * √û√≥rir J√∂kull Steinfinnsson (13th century) Icelandic poet See also * Old Norse poetry * Alliterative verse * Scop * Bard * Nƒ´√æ Puts the role of the skald into context as one who \\"shouted in their faces what they were in most derogatory terms\\".

Initially as lead singer of Dion and the Belmonts and then in his solo career, he was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits. Dion's popularity waned in the mid-1960s. Toward the end of the decade, he shifted his style and produced songs with a more mature, contemplative feeling, such as \\"Abraham, Martin and John.\\" He became popular again in the late 1960s and into the mid-1970s, and he has continued making music ever since. Critics who had dismissed his early work, pegging him as merely a teen idol, praised his later work, and noted the influence he has had on other musicians. Dion was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Early years Dion was born to an Italian- American family in the Bronx, New York. As a child, he accompanied his father, Pasquale DiMucci, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music ‚Äì particularly the work of Hank Williams. He also developed a fondness for the blues and doo-wop musicians he heard performing in local bars and on the radio. His singing was honed on the street corners and local clubs of the Bronx, where he and other neighborhood singers created a cappella riffs. In early 1957, he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz for their short- lived Mohawk Records label. They asked Dion to sing a song which had been arranged by Hugo Montenegro and recorded featuring Vic Damone doing vocals. At first Dion refused, stating the song would sound like something his old fashioned parents would listen to, but the Schwartzes convinced him to give it a try. The backing vocals were by a group called \\"The Timberlanes\\", whom Dion had never met.DiMucci, Dion with Davin Seay: The Wanderer ‚Äì Dion's Story. Beach Tree, 1988, p. 58 The resulting single, \\"The Chosen Few,\\" was released under the name Dion and the Timberlanes, and became a minor regional hit. Dion himself stated in 2019 during an interview at \\"Crashing the Party\\" (a Radio Show related to Norton Records, Brooklyn, New York) that \\"The Chosen Few\\" hit the Top Ten locally in Boston and enabled him to perform this song on \\"American Bandstand\\" where the kids at the show started screaming during his performance, which gave him his first impression of being a record star. Writing about this experience later, in his autobiography, The Wanderer, Dion said that he had never met the Timberlanes and didn't even know who they were. \\"The vocal group was so white bread, I went back to my neighborhood and I recruited a bunch of guys ‚Äì three guys ‚Äì and we called ourselves Dion and the Belmonts.\\" Career =With the Belmonts: 1957‚Äì1960= Bob and Gene Schwartz also signed Dion's friends, the Belmonts (Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano, and Angelo D'Aleo), a vocal group named for the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, and teamed them with Dion singing lead. The new group's breakthrough came in early 1958, when \\"I Wonder Why\\" (on their newly formed Laurie Records) made No. 22 on the U.S. charts. Dion said of the Belmonts; \\"I'd give 'em sounds. I'd give 'em parts and stuff. That's what 'I Wonder Why' was about. We kind of invented this percussive rhythmic sound. If you listen to that song, everybody was doing something different. There's four guys, one guy was doing bass, I was singing lead, one guy's going 'ooh wah ooh,' and another guy's doing tenor. It was totally amazing. When I listen to it today, oftentimes I think, 'man, those kids are talented.'\\" Their initial hit was followed by \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Don't Pity Me\\", which also charted the Billboard Top 100. This success won a place for Dion and the Belmonts on the ill-fated \\"The Winter Dance Party\\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), Frankie Sardo, and other performers. On February 3, 1959, after a concert stop in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. Dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend $36 for the flight, as it was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he couldn't justify the indulgence.DiMucci, Dion: The Wanderer, page 89. Beech Tree Books, 1988 The plane crashed, killing all on board: Holly, Valens, Richardson, and the pilot Roger Peterson. Dion and the Belmonts continued on the tour, along with Frankie Sardo, while Bobby Vee, then an unknown artist, performed in Holly's place at the very next concert. Later, Jimmy Clanton, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian were added to replace the other now- deceased headliners. Dion and the Belmonts' next single, \\"A Teenager in Love\\", was released in March 1959, eventually hitting No. 5 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 28 in the UK. The group's biggest hit, \\"Where or When\\", was released in November of that year, and reached No. 3 on the U.S. charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked into hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful. There were musical, personal and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960, Dion decided to quit for a solo career. By the time of their breakup, all eight Laurie releases had charted on the Hot 100. =Solo stardom: 1960‚Äì1964= By the end of 1960, Dion had released his first solo album on Laurie, Alone with Dion, and the single \\"Lonely Teenager\\", which rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply \\"Dion\\". Follow-ups \\"Havin' Fun\\" and \\"Kissin' Game\\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with a new vocal group, the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \\"Runaround Sue\\", stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK, where he also toured. \\"Runaround Sue\\" sold over a million copies, achieving gold disc status. For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, \\"The Majestic\\", but it was the B-side, Maresca's \\"The Wanderer\\", which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK (the 1976 re- release made the UK Top 20). \\"The Wanderer\\" has been used in the post- apocalyptic role-playing game Fallout 4, both in-game and in a trailer of the same name released in 2015. By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film Twist Around the Clock. In 1962, he followed with a string of singles he wrote or co-wrote including \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" (No. 3), \\"Little Diane\\" (No. 8), \\"Love Came to Me\\" (No. 10). He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R; director, Mitch Miller, loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, Leiber and Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\" (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" using the identical backup vocals.) His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes, especially The British Invasion, saw a period of commercial decline. =Changing fortunes: 1965‚Äì1968= Following a European tour, Dion returned to the U.S. and was introduced to classic blues by Columbia‚Äôs John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon's \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and \\"Spoonful\\", but these releases ‚Äì some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards ‚Äì were not commercially successful. In 1965, still with Columbia, Dion formed a new group to back him, The Wanderers, composed of John Falbo on guitar, Pete Baron (Pete Falciglia) on bass, and Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts on drums. They made national appearances on Dick Clark's, Where The Action Is, and The Lloyd Thaxton Show. A number of self-penned tracks were recorded and released unsuccessfully as singles, and did not appear in album format until years later. In June 1965 he recorded fellow Columbia Records's contemporary Bob Dylan's composition \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" a half- year before Them (featuring Van Morrison)'s hit version. In 1966‚Äì67, Dion briefly reunited with The Belmonts, recording the LP Together Again for ABC Records. The album was unsuccessful, despite one classic self-penned song, \\"My Girl the Month of May\\". Two singles were released from the LP. While neither charted in the United States, they fared better in the UK. \\"My Girl The Month of May\\" entered the \\"Radio London Fab 40\\" top ten at No. 9 the week of December 25, 1966. A 'turntable' hit at London underground clubs like Middle Earth, the disc received a lot of play from pirate radio DJ's John Peel and Kenny Everett. The follow up, \\"Movin' Man\\", reached No. 17 on the \\"Radio London\\" charts on Easter Sunday, March 26, 1967. \\"My Girl The Month of May\\" was later covered by English artists Alan Bown in 1967, and Island Records artists The Bunch (featuring Sandy Denny and other members of Fairport Convention) in April 1972. During their brief mid 60's reunion, Dion and the Belmonts appeared on the popular \\"Clay Cole Show\\" performing \\"Berimbau\\" and \\"My Girl The Month of May\\", and occasionally performed at local New York City clubs such as \\"The Mardi Gras\\" on Staten Island (April 29, 1967) before disbanding. While Dion's career appeared to be nearing an end, he still retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, one of only two rock artists featured on the album cover of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. In April 1968, Dion experienced what he identified as a powerful religious experience. After getting clean once again from heroin addiction, an experience he documented in his 1970 song \\"Your Own Backyard\\", he approached Laurie Records for a new contract. They agreed on condition that he record the song \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of the Royal Guardsmen's \\"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\\") in response to the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 and those of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy during the spring of 1968. The success of this song ‚Äì released by Dion in August 1968 and later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye ‚Äì which reached No. 4 in the US charts and No. 1 in Canada, resuscitated Dion's career. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. =Mature and Christian period: 1969‚Äì1986= For the next few years, Dion's music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969. There followed a live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden on June 2, 1972, which was recorded and released as a live album by Warner. A year later, in 1973, Dion and the original Belmonts performed once more, doing a sold out concert at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, New York. However, no recording of the 1973 reunion was ever released. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born to Be with You produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who and the track 'Only You Know' was sampled by Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker for his single \\"Don't Let Him Waste Your Time\\" from his 2006 solo album Jarvis. In 1978, Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another commercial failure. In December 1979, there was a radical spiritual change in Dion, who had become a born-again Christian. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian vein, in which he released five albums on the DaySpring Records label, a division of Word Records in Waco, Texas. These albums reflecting his evangelical Christian convictions were Inside Job (1980), Only Jesus (1981), I Put Away My Idols (1983) which charted at No. 37, Seasons (1984), Kingdom in the Streets (1985) and Velvet & Steel (1986). Several singles were successfully released to Christian radio, notably \\"Still in the Spirit\\" from Kingdom in the Streets. In 1984, Dion won the GMA Dove Award (Christian Music Award) for the album I Put Away My Idols. He was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Gospel Vocal Performance, Male for the same album. On September 24, 1985, Dion was a guest on 100 Huntley Street. =Return to secular music and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction and controversy: 1987‚Äì1999= In 1987, Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The two disc CD of this concert was released in 2005, featuring concert photos by Dion's friend, Michael J. Friedman. This concert helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences. In 1988, Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In 1989, DiMucci returned to rock music with the contemporary album Yo Frankie, which included appearances by Paul Simon, Lou Reed, k.d. lang, Patty Smyth and Bryan Adams. Produced by Dave Edmunds (who also played guitar on the album), \\"Yo Frankie has a sharp sound while never losing sight of Dion's soulful, doo-wop voice.\\" Overall, \\"the relevant and nostalgic statement from an artist who helped forge rock & roll's first wave\\" found his way back on radio and in music videos during this period (both on VH1 and MTV), as well as touring. Dion was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 (with a moving introduction by Lou Reed). Controversially, when Dion's solo induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame occurred, the other original members of the Belmonts (Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano, and Angelo D'Aleo) were not inducted, and as of 2019, have yet to be. In a Billboard Magazine article, dated January 3, 2012, it was stated: \\"There was strife between DiMucci and Belmonts members, who were not pleased when DiMucci was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame without them in 1989.\\" In the late 1990s, Dion visited his old Bronx parish, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and returned to Catholicism. Sparking Dion's reversion to Catholicism was \\"a chance viewing of the Journey Home program on EWTN.\\" On May 1, 2006, Dion appeared on The Journey Home program and discussed his wanderings from Catholicism to Protestantism and back again. DiMucci joined Scott Kempner and Frank Funaro of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of the Smithereens in a short- lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted. =Most recent work: 2000s‚Äì2020s= Dion has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His D√©j√† Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years. He joined Bruce Springsteen onstage in Miami in 2002 for a performance of \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" from Dream on Fire. In 2002, Dion was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for \\"Runaround Sue\\". He continues to perform songs from his albums live; one concert in 2004 was recorded for release on DVD. In January 2006, Dion released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was nominated for a Grammy. In November 2007 he issued a follow-up in similar vein, Son of Skip James. In October 2008, DiMucci released Heroes: Giants of Early Guitar Rock, an album of his covers of early rock and roll songs he considers seminal to the genre. The album includes versions of songs originally recorded by Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Ricky Nelson, Johnny Cash and many other early rock guitarists. In October 2009, Dion performed \\"The Wanderer\\" with Paul Simon at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert. Now a practicing Roman Catholic, Dion pursues prison ministry and reaches out to men going through addiction recovery. He was a member of the American board of directors of Renewal Ministries in 2004. He currently lives in Boca Raton, Florida, and New York City. On January 24, 2012, Dion released a new album, Tank Full of Blues. As of 2015, Dion was still touring. On April 5, 2015, Dion performed \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" live in Las Vegas. On July 11, 2015, he held a concert in Westbury, New York. In 2015, he released a single, New York Is My Home, with Paul Simon. Dion had previously worked with Simon on his 1989 hit Written on the Subway Wall. The single was followed by the album New York Is My Home, released February 12, 2016. A February 2016 performance at the intimate Grammy Museum in LA demonstrated the enduring power of Dion's voice. Many great singers begin to lose their \\"range\\" with age; flexibility and phrasing can suffer. By contrast, Dion's voice sounded almost unchanged from his early years. His high tenor, his attack and his ability to imply subtle pathos in apparently macho songs like 'The Wanderer' demonstrate that, like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, he has the soul of a Blues singer.John Perry in conversation with Alejandro Escovedo backstage at Paramount Theatre, Austin TX http://www.alejandroescovedo.com/news/austin-360-alejandro-escovedo-makes-a- powerful-statement-with-the-crossing-at-the-paramount/ Dion planned four concerts in the U.S. during early 2016. Dion was invited as a keynote speaker for the 2016 SXSW in Texas. He spoke on the topic A Conversation with Dion: Rock's Enduring Voice on March 17, 2016. In May 2017, Dion released Kickin' Child: The Lost Album 1965, songs recorded in 1965 when he was with Columbia, who did not release them; the current album is from Norton Records. Also released in May 2017 was Richard Barone's Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s on which Dion performs a duet of his 1964 song \\"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\\" with Barone. The album is a celebration of the New York City scene that Dion was part of during that pivotal era. The Wanderer musical On October 13, 2011, an industry-only reading of a new play about Dion's life was performed in New York City. In a December 9, 2011 article in The New York Times, Dion and his collaborator, writer/director Charles Messina, discussed details about the project, titled The Wanderer: The Life and Music of Dion, revealing that it will focus on the years between 1957 until the late 60s and will feature more than 20 songs from that era as well as new, original music. In the article, Dion gave his perspective on the story: \\"You know, I always saw my story as a young Sopranos with great music and a Rocky Graziano Somebody Up There Likes Me ending. It's a story of redemption. A rock and roll redemption story!\\" On December 16, 2017, DiMucci revealed that Michael Wartella would be starring in The Wanderer. There was a reading of the musical on November 2, 2017 and it continues to be worked on. On December 4, 2019, it was announced that former New Kids on the Block member Joey McIntyre will star as Dion, starting May 28, 2020, in the initial run at the Paper Mill Playhouse. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening performance was rescheduled to April 8, 2021.

It was designed by Henry Dreyfuss Associates under the project direction of Donald Genaro; the firm had designed all previous desktop telephone models for the American Telephone & Telegraph conglomerate. History After the introduction of the popular Princess telephone line, in 1959 and the early 1960s, the design motivation for the Trimline series was to create an alternative design that was stylish and easier to use than a traditional telephone. This was accomplished by moving the dial from the telephone's base to the underside of the handset, between the earpiece and mouthpiece. The same concept was later used for cellular telephone and cordless telephone models. To miniaturize the rotary dial sufficiently to fit in the Trimline handset, the designers invented an unusual moving fingerstop. Like in the Princess line, the dial was lit when the handset was removed from the base. The Trimline was also one of the first phones to use the predecessor of the now- ubiquitous RJ11 modular phone plug and jack. First introduced in 1965, the Trimline included a lighted dial and was encased in a sleek, curved plastic housing that took up much less space than earlier Western Electric telephones. However, the glass-smooth and shallowly-curved plastic handset proved difficult to retain between cheek and shoulder for hands-free communication without slipping, and this problem was never corrected over the life of the model line. Cushioned clamp-on adaptors were manufactured and sold by third parties to make it easier to cradle the handset, but these add-ons would greatly compromise the aesthetic appearance of the telephone. The first Trimline models used incandescent dial lights powered by a power transformer plugged into a standard 120VAC outlet. The bulky transformer and the need for a conveniently-placed 120-volt outlet was criticized by many consumers, but was necessary because of the power demands of the incandescent light bulb. Years later, Western Electric redesigned the Trimline to use a low-power green LED backlit dial powered by current from the phone line, eliminating the need for a separate transformer. Always eager to re-use its older stocks of turned- in rental phones, AT&T; later repainted and sold early-model non-LED Trimlines as \\"non-lighted\\" models, without a transformer. =Variants= The Trimline handset was produced in both rotary dial and Touch-Tone versions. Rotary dial Trimline production began in late 1965 and Touch Tone dials were added the following year in mid-1966. The Trimline base was available in desk-top and wall-mount versions. The handsets and bases were interchangeable. The Trimline was the first US telephone to achieve some design recognition in Europe, where it was referred to as the \\"Manhattan\\" model or the \\"Gondola\\". Today, similarly designed telephones are sold by many companies. AT&T; retained the Trimline name for the later \\"Trimline III\\", a more compact successor featuring squared corners and straight lines. In the 21st century, Advanced American Telephones produces the Trimline models 205, 210 (based upon original design), and the 265, under license from AT&T.; =Powered RJ11 jacks for illumination = In the Trimline version designed for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While the phone line itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone (or to all of the jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks in other parts of the house. The early Trimline and Princess phone dial light incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric- made Princess version had no dial light.  Timeline  *1965 Original Trimline introduced in the winter of 1965. Only rotary dial versions produced that first year, and availability was limited. *1966 Touch Tone keypads become available in addition to dial models at mid-year. First touch-tone phones lack pound and star buttons and so only have ten buttons. *1968 Keypads on Touch Tone models were expanded to 12 keys, adding a pound and a star button to prepare for future functionality not yet available in 1968. *early 70s The clear plastic button backplate with colored paper backing matching the color of the phone is replaced with an aluminum backplate on the round button Touch- Tone phones. Also at this time, the round handset cords using proprietary connectors are replaced with modern flat modular cords and jacks. On all Trimline phones, the screw cover above the dial changes from reading \\"Bell System made by Western Electric\\" to just \\"Trimline\\" with a bell logo to the left of the text. *late 70s A green LED light fed by the phone line power replaces the incandescent lamp, additionally, the Touch-Tone version now sports slightly larger, square keys, as opposed to the earlier small round keys. Also the Touch-Tone version receives an aluminum faceplate behind the keys. *1983 AT&T; begins selling phones, including the Trimline, to the public (as opposed to their previous leasing only policy) through its newly created American Bell, Inc. subsidiary. *1984 AT&T; is divested of its regional operating companies and is prohibited from using the Bell name or logo, so the American Bell brand is dropped and replaced with simply AT&T.; All telephone production continues as normal. **Late 1984 The Touch-tone Trimline phone is heavily modified with the following new features: ***Electronic chirp ringer in the handset, replacing the previous real bell ringer ***Keys are now made of a soft rubber material ***Line switch (switchhook) eliminated from base, moved to top of phone just below the receiver ***Handset screws' cover no longer says \\"Trimline\\"; made smaller in the middle to conform to new switchhook location ***Only one handset-to-jack cord is required for the telephone connection; cord can be tightly secured onto the bottom of the base, which now only exists with no purpose other than as a rest for the handset *1985 The rotary Trimline is discontinued, and further modifications are made to the touch-tone model: **Desk or wall convertible, eliminating separate desk and wall models **Touch-Tone/dial pulse switch, eliminating separate Touch- Tone and rotary models **Redial and Mute functions **One cord to connect telephone is eliminated, base-to-handset and base-to-jack cords reinstated *1986 With the closing of the Western Electric Indianapolis Works, Trimline production is moved overseas to Singapore and China. Minor modifications included: **Earpiece Volume Control **Chirp Ringer/ringer loudness switch moved to base of the phone **Bottom of the base is now made of plastic, with a lead weight inside the base **Only 1 screw is used to hold the handset together; location of screw and screw cover is moved to below the dialpad **2220 Trimline is dropped as a model number, replaced by the 210, 220, and 230. *1993 The Trimline phone is again updated with the following features: **The soft rubber keys are again replaced with hard plastic keys, similar to the late 70s and early 80s models, but the keys are even larger and rectangular rather than square **The faceplate behind the keys, aluminum since the late 70s LED conversion is now a dark gray plastic with a matte surface **Production is moved to Mexico **Caller ID models, the 250 & 260, are introduced under the Trimline brand. The design shares nothing in common with the 210 model. *1996 Lucent Technologies is spun off from AT&T;, and minor modifications are added: **Phones are marked \\"Lucent Technologies\\", though this turned out to be temporary, and the boxes and marketing materials were always co-branded with AT&T; **\\"Trimline\\" again marked above the dialpad on the matte surface **Ringer loudness switch is moved back to dialpad; ringer remains inside the base *1997 Lucent enters a joint venture with Philips, creating Philips Consumer Communications. Shortly after, more changes are made: **Handset screws are eliminated completely. Handset is only held together by \\"snap\\" ends at both ends of the phone, above the receiver and below the microphone. **Telephones are again branded AT&T; Lucent Technologies branding ends. **Ringer moved into handset. *2000 Lucent dissolved the joint venture with Philips in 1998, and sells its consumer division to Hong Kong company VTech, where it becomes Advanced American Telephones. VTech moved all production to the People's Republic of China. See also * Bell System Practices * Contempra, a similar form factor handset designed by Northern Electric and deployed by Bell Canada.

Little known in his own lifetime, Pink became \\"one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century.\\"Murray, xiii. Biography Arthur Walkington Pink was born in Nottingham, England, to a corn merchant, a devout non-conformist of uncertain denomination, though probably a Congregationalist.Murray, 1-5, 15. Otherwise, almost nothing is known of Pink's childhood or education except that he had some ability and training in music.Murray, 6. As a young man, Pink joined the Theosophical Society and apparently rose to enough prominence within its ranks that Annie Besant, its head, offered to admit him to its leadership circle.Murray, 9‚Äì10. In 1908 he renounced Theosophy for evangelical Christianity.Murray, 12‚Äì13. Desiring to become a minister but unwilling to attend a liberal theological college in England, Pink very briefly studied at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago in 1910 before taking the pastorate of the Congregational church in Silverton, Colorado. In 1912 Pink left Silverton, probably for California, and then took a joint pastorate of churches in rural Burkesville and Albany, Kentucky.Murray, 16-28. In 1916, he married Vera E. Russell (1893‚Äì1962), who had been reared in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Pink's next pastorate was at Scottsville Baptist Church, Scottsville, Kentucky. Then the newlyweds moved in 1917 to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where Pink became pastor of Northside Baptist Church.Murray, 35. By this time Pink had become acquainted with prominent dispensationalist Fundamentalists, such as Harry Ironside and Arno C. Gaebelein, and his first two books, published in 1917 and 1918, were in agreement with that theological position.Murray, 39-42. Yet Pink's views were changing, and during these years he also wrote the first edition of The Sovereignty of God (1918), which argued that God did not love sinners and had deliberately created \\"unto damnation\\" those who would not accept Christ.Murray, 45. Whether because of his Calvinistic views, his nearly incredible studiousness, his weakened health, or his lack of sociability, Pink left Spartanburg in 1919 believing that God would \\"have me give myself to writing.\\"Murray, 43-56. But Pink then seems next to have taught the Bible‚Äîwith some success‚Äîin California for a tent evangelist named Thompson while continuing his intense study of Puritan writings. In January 1922, Pink published the first issue of Studies in the Scriptures, which by the end of the following year had about a thousand subscribers and which was to occupy most of his time for the remainder of his life and become the source for dozens of books, some arranged from Studies articles after his death.Murray, 72-76. In 1923 Pink suffered a nervous breakdown, and he and his wife lived with friends in Philadelphia until he regained his health. In 1925, the Pinks sailed to Sydney, Australia, where he served as both an evangelist and Bible teacher at the Ashfield Tabernacle. But his impolitic preaching of Calvinist doctrine resulted in a unanimous resolve of the Baptist Fraternal of New South Wales not to endorse him. From 1926 to 1928, Pink served as pastor of two groups of Strict and Particular Baptists.Murray argues that Pink left the first of these two groups because he was not Calvinistic enough for them because he asserted belief in the \\"free offer of the gospel and in human responsibility to receive the gospel.\\", 77-123; R. P. Belcher, \\"Pink, Arthur Walkington,\\" Timothy Larson, ed., Biographical Dictionary of Evangelicals (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2003), 529. Ronald Hanko argues that \\"Pink never taught that God loves everyone or desires to save everyone, or promises salvation to everyone in the gospel, as the Banner does.\\" Ronald Hanko, \\"The Forgotten Pink,\\" British Reformed Journal No. 17 (Jan-March 1997), 4, http://www.prca.org/pamphlets/pamphlet_106.pdf. Returning to England, Pink was invited to preach at a pastorless church in Seaton, Devon; but though he was welcomed by some members, the overseers thought his installation as pastor would split the church.Murray, 126-29. In the spring of 1929, Pink and wife returned to her home state of Kentucky where he intended to become pastor of the Baptist church in Morton's Gap. Once again his hopes were unrealized. To a friend he wrote, \\"I am more firmly convinced today than I was 14 months ago that our place is on the 'outside of the camp.' That is the place of 'reproach,' of loneliness, and of testing.\\"Quoted in Murray, 134. In 1930 Pink was able to start a Bible class in Glendale, California, while also turning down opportunities to speak in some Fundamentalist churches.Murray, 138-42. The following year, the Pinks rented an unpainted wooden house in Union County, Pennsylvania, where a small group met; then in 1933 they moved to York, Pennsylvania. Pink decided that if his ministry was to be totally one of writing, he could do that just as well in England. In September 1934 he and his wife moved to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, near honorary agents of Studies in the Scriptures. Pink seems to have finally given way to despair. To a friend he wrote \\"that those of my friends who would dearly like to help me are powerless to do so; while those who could, will not. And in a very few years at most it will be too late. What I have gone through the last seven years is so reacting on my physical and mental constitution, that ere long I shall be incapacitated even if doors should be opened unto me. However, I can see nothing else than to attempt to seek grace to bow to the Lord's sovereign pleasure, and say, 'Not my will, but thine be done.'\\"Quoted in Murray, 154. In 1936, the Pinks moved to Hove, on the south coast near Brighton. After the death of his father in 1933, Pink received enough of the estate to allow him and his wife to live very simply without financial concerns; and between 1936 until his death in 1952, Pink devoted himself completely to Studies in the Scriptures. Vera believed her husband's almost unrelenting work schedule unhealthy, and she remarkably succeeded in having him take up stamp collecting as a hobby.Murray, 239-42. In 1940, Hove became a regular target of German air raids, and the Pinks moved to Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, where they remained for the rest of his life. The island was a bastion of Calvinism, but church services were held mostly in Scots Gaelic, and visitors were not especially welcomed in any case.Murray, 245-49. Pink governed his time in study and writing with \\"military precision.\\" To a friend he wrote that he went out to shop and get exercise for an hour, six days a week, but that otherwise he never left his study except when working in a small garden. While in Hove, he even published a note in Studies advising subscribers that \\"it is not convenient for us to receive any visitors, and respectfully ask readers who may visit these parts to kindly refrain from calling upon us, but please note that we are always glad to hear from Christian friends.\\"Murray, 249, 250, 254. Rather than attend church, on Sunday mornings, Pink spent time ministering to readers by letter.Belcher, 529. In 1951 Vera became aware that Pink was failing. He lost weight and was in pain but refused to take any medicine that might dull his mind and hinder him from completing his work. He died on 15 July 1952. His last words were \\"The Scriptures explain themselves.\\" Pink left enough written material to allow publication of Studies until December 1953.Murray, 270-75. Vera Pink survived her husband by ten years and after his death made new friends and mingled more freely with others.Murray, 283. She was remembered by one of these friends as \\"an elegant and gracious lady with a radiant expression and a loving and lively interest in people.\\" Influence It is alleged that Pink's personality made it difficult for him to have a successful pastoral ministry. He has been criticized for being too individualistic and of too critical a temperament, lacking the benefit of thorough theological discussions with other men of similar gifts. One young pastor, Rev. Robert Harbach who corresponded with Pink for years remembered a very different Pink, who possessed a \\"pastor's heart.\\" Pink's correspondence with Harbach (until Pink's failing health ended their correspondence in 1949) was warm, heartfelt and fatherly. Early in their correspondence, Pink wrote \\"I want you to feel perfectly free to call on me for any help I may be able to render you. I am in touch with a number of young pastors, and I deem it part of my work, and a privilege, to offer what advice I can.\\"Harbach, 10. Pink's acclaimed contemporary D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones received spiritual benefit from reading Pink and recommended him to others. To one young minister, he said, \\"Don't waste your time reading Barth and Brunner. You will get nothing from them to aid you with preaching. Read Pink.\\"Murray, 166, 211, 304. But Lloyd-Jones also said, \\"If I had behaved as Pink did, I would have achieved nothing. Nothing at all... I had to be very patient and take a very long-term look at things. Otherwise I would have been dismissed and whole thing would have been finished.\\"Murray, D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones: The Fight of Faith, 1939‚Äì1981 (Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1990), 232. Furthermore, without the assistance and companionship of his wife, who dedicated herself completely to him and his work, Pink would have (as he freely admitted) \\"been overwhelmed\\" and probably would have achieved little even in writing.Murray, 304. Theologically Pink was rejected during his lifetime because of his opposition to Arminianism; but after his death, there was a major shift of evangelical opinion towards Calvinistic theology. By 1982, Baker Book House had published 22 of Pink's books and sold 350,000 total copies. Nevertheless, it was Pink's Sovereignty of God that did \\"more than any other in redirecting the thinking of a younger generation.\\" After Banner of Truth Trust republished it in 1961‚Äîmodifying it to remove Pink's alleged hyper-Calvinism‚Äîthe book sold 177,000 copies by 2004.Murray, 314‚Äì15. The Banner of Truth Trust edition has been criticized for omitting nearly half the original work, including three entire chapters.

Structure Brocchinia reducta, like many other bromeliads, forms a water-storing cup with its tightly-overlapping leaves. The leaves surrounding the cup of B. reducta are coated with loose, waxy scales. These scales are highly reflective of ultraviolet light. Since many insects are attracted to ultraviolet (it is also reflected by many flowers), this is an efficient lure. The water in the cup also emits a sweet odor, which may serve to attract ants and other insects. B. reducta absorbs its nutrients from the outer cell wall, which is covered in trichomes that can transport molecules as small as 6.6 nm. The loose scales provide a poor foothold for landing insects, causing them to slip into the water-filled cup and eventually drown. It has been argued that B. reducta is not actually carnivorous because the production of digestive enzymes could not be found. However, in 2005 it was shown that the plant produces at least phosphatase enzymes in its glandular structures and is thus considered a true carnivorous plant. The enzymes and bacteria digest the trapped insects and thus release the nutrients for absorption by the leaves.Plachno, B.

He is the fourth of six children of former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush (n√©e Pierce). His five siblings are George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States; Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida; Marvin Bush; Dorothy Bush Koch. Neil Bush is currently a businessman based in Texas.  Early life  On January 22, 1955, Bush was born in Midland, Texas. Bush was named after a good friend of the family, Henry Neil Mallon, chairman of Dresser Industries, George H. W. Bush's employer. As a child, Bush spent some summers and holidays at his family's estate in Maine, the Bush compound. At age 11, he entered the exclusive St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. He struggled through school; a counselor told his mother that it was doubtful the boy had the potential to graduate. He was later diagnosed as having dyslexia, and his mother spent much time coaching him through his learning disability. Eventually, his grades improved and he graduated from St. Albans in 1973.  Education  In 1977, Bush earned a degree in economics from Tulane University. In 1979, Bush earned an MBA. Neil Mallon Bush, the leftmost person in the front row in this photograph of the Bush family taken in the early 1960s Career and business dealings =Silverado Savings and Loan= Neil Bush was a member of the board of directors of Denver-based Silverado Savings and Loan from 1985 to 1988, during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. As his father, George H. W. Bush, was Vice President of the United States, his role in Silverado's failure was a focal point of publicity. The US Office of Thrift Supervision investigated Silverado's failure and determined that Bush had engaged in numerous \\"breaches of his fiduciary duties involving multiple conflicts of interest.\\" Although Bush was not indicted on criminal charges, a civil action was brought against him and the other Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it was eventually settled out of court, with Bush paying $50,000 as part of the settlement. A friend who also donated funds to the Republican Party set up a fund to help defer costs Neil incurred in his S&L; legal defense. =Ignite! Learning= In 1999, Bush co-founded Ignite! Learning, an educational software corporation. Bush has said he started Austin-based Ignite! Learning because of his learning difficulties in middle school and those of his son, Pierce. The software uses multiple intelligence methods to provide varying types of content to appeal to multiple learning styles. To fund Ignite!, Bush raised $23 million from US investors, including his parents, as well as businessmen from Taiwan, Japan, Kuwait, the British Virgin Islands and the United Arab Emirates, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Documented investors included Kuwaiti company head Mohammed Al Saddah, and Chinese computer executive Winston Wong, as well as the late Russian billionaire expatriate Boris Berezovsky, and Berezovsky's partner Badri Patarkatsishvili. Bush's relationship with the late controversial oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a political enemy of Russian President Vladimir Putin who at the time of his death had been under indictment for fraud in Russia and an applicant for asylum in the United Kingdom, has been noted in the media. Berezovsky, who died in 2013, had been an investor in Bush's Ignite! program since at least 2003. Bush met with Berezovsky in Latvia. The meeting caused tension between that country and Russia due to Berezovsky's fugitive status. Bush was also seen in Berezovsky's box at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for a football game in 2006, which prompted some stateside criticism. There had also been speculation in the English language Moscow Times that the relationship may cause tension in U.S.-Russian bilateral relations, \\"especially since Putin had taken pains to build a personal relationship with the U.S. president,\\" George Bush. In 2002, Neil Bush commended his brother, George, for his efforts on education as president, but he questioned the emphasis on constant testing to keep federal aid coming to public schools: \\"I share the concerns of many that if our system is driven around assessments, pencil-and-paper tests that test a kid's ability to memorize stuff, I would say that reliance threatens to institutionalize bad teaching practices.\\" As of October 2006, over 13 US school districts (out of over 14,000 school districts nationwide) have used federal funds made available through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to buy Ignite's portable learning centers at $3,800 apiece. A December 2003 Style section article in The Washington Post reported that Bush's salary from Ignite! was $180,000 per year. =Kopin stock trades= In July 1999, Bush made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of a company where he had been employed as a consultant. The company, Kopin Corporation of Taunton, Massachusetts, announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, \\"any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information.\\" When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations. =Speaking engagements= Bush has often been invited to speak to audiences overseas. Bush says he has courtesy visits with world leaders but has no plans to wade into foreign policy. \\"Oftentimes because of my father's goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it's enjoyable for me,\\" Bush said. \\"Some of these folks are family friends.\\" Speaking at a Saudi Arabian economic forum in January 2002, Bush referred to growing anti-American sentiment in Arab countries and said the two peoples must communicate better. He said the Arab P.R. machine is not as good as Israel's. Bush frequently travels to the Middle East, Europe and Asia to negotiate deals and raise capital for various businesses. According to court filings from his divorce, in 2000 he was paid $1.3 million for such work. This includes $642,500 as a commission for introducing an Asian investor to the owners of an American high-tech company. The George W. Bush-era White House Administration appeared unfazed by his world travel. \\"The president knows his brother will always do the right thing,\\" press secretary Ari Fleischer said.\\" =Other business engagements= In 2002, Bush signed a consulting contract that paid $2 million in stock over five years to work for Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a firm backed by Jiang Mianheng, the son of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, plus $10,000 for every board meeting he attends. Bush serves as co-chairman of a company called Crest Investment. Crest pays him $60,000 a year to provide miscellaneous consulting services. In 2001, Neil Bush incorporated an investment firm called LehmanBush with veteran China lawyer Edward Lehman. Philanthropy and charity involvement, volunteer work =George H.W. Bush Foundation For U.S.-China Relations= Neil Bush is the founder and chairman of the George H.W. Bush Foundation For U.S.-China Relations. Created in 2017, the Foundation serves as a U.S.-China Relations Think Tank, Track 2 Diplomacy Policy Hub and for Business, Trade and U.S. Investment. The organization holds an annual George H.W. Bush Conference on U.S.-China Relations. The purpose of The George H. W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations seeks to advance U.S.-China relations in ways that reflect the ethos and values of President George H. W. Bush, whose visionary, wise, deft and steady stewardship of the U.S.-China relationship during his tenure as president was exemplary of the highest attributes and values of true statesmanship. Through an active, wide-ranging and highly innovative program of activities, the Bush China Foundation promotes the late president's life-long view that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world and that a positive and constructive relationship between the two countries is in the best interest of both the United States and China as well as the entire global community. =Points of Light= Neil Bush is the chairman of Points of Light; an international nonprofit that works to increase volunteerism in the world.Board of Directors, Points of Light Institute Points of Light has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million. =Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue= Bush was a founding director, along with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI), of the Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue (FIIRD). The foundation promotes ecumenical understanding and publishes religious texts and was founded in 1999. Bush is no longer on the board of the foundation. =Anti- Ritalin campaign= In 2002, Neil Bush told the New York Post that he \\"endured his own Ritalin hell seven years ago when educators in a Houston private school diagnosed his son, Pierce, (then) 16, with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and pushed medication.\\" In a September 26, 2002, episode of CNN Interview, Bush told Connie Chung: Bush decided \\"the educators were wrong\\" about his son. \\"There is a systemic problem in this country, where schools are often forcing parents to turn to Ritalin,\\" he said. \\"It's obvious to me that we have a crisis.\\" Also that year, Bush testified before a hearing of the United States Congress to speak out against over-medicating children for learning disorders. He has suggested that many parents believe the ADD and ADHD diagnoses and subsequent medicating of their children because it explains why they aren't doing well in school, saying \\"it's the system that is failing to engage children in the classroom. My heart goes out to any parents who are being led to believe their kids have a disorder or are disabled.\\" Neil Bush (along with filmmaker Michael Moore) is credited in the cast of a 2005 documentary film, The Drugging of Our Children directed by Gary Null. In the film's trailerThe Drugging of Our Children Film Detail at Ostrow and Company Bush says: \\"Just because it is easy to drug a kid and get them to be compliant doesn't make it right to do it.\\" =Unification Church= In Asia, Bush accompanied Sun Myung Moon, the founder of the Unification Church, on his world peace tour. In 2009 Bush congratulated Moon on the publication of his autobiography at a Unification Church sponsored event. He was quoted as saying: \\"Rev. Moon is presenting a very simple concept. We are all children of God.\\" =Ted Cruz presidential campaign= After his brother Jeb dropped out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race, Neil and his wife Maria signed on to the finance team of fellow Republican Ted Cruz. Personal life Bush was married to Sharon (n√©e Smith) Bush (born May 19, 1952) for 23 years. The couple have three children: Lauren Pierce Bush (born June 25, 1984), Pierce Mallon Bush (born March 11, 1986) and Ashley Walker Bush (born February 7, 1989). The couple divorced in April 2003. Bush's divorce deposition gained public attention when he admitted to several sexual encounters in Thailand and Hong Kong. Sharon gained custody of their minor child Ashley, who for a while was estranged from her father. In addition, Sharon kept their marital home after she collected enough money to pay off the mortgage. In 2004, Bush remarried in Houston, Texas, to Mexican-born Maria (n√©e Manass) Andrews, a volunteer at the Houston literacy-foundation office of Bush's mother, Barbara. Robert Andrews, Andrews' ex-husband, sued Sharon Bush in September 2003 for defamation after she alleged that Neil Bush was the father of Andrews' two- year-old son. DNA testing showed that Andrews was the father, but the suit was dismissed in 2005.  References  External links *Excerpt from \\"George Bush‚Äîthe unauthorized biography\\" *Wilmsen, Steven.

It is an ionic compound (a salt) consisting of the ions copper(II) , carbonate , and hydroxide . The name most commonly refers to the compound with formula ()2. It is a green crystalline solid that occurs in nature as the mineral malachite. It has been used since antiquity as a pigment, and it is still used as such in artist paints, sometimes called verditer, green bice, or mountain green. Sometimes the name is used for ()2()2, a blue crystalline solid also known as the mineral azurite. It too has been used as pigment, sometimes under the name mountain blue or blue verditer. Both malachite and azurite can be found in the verdigris patina that is found on weathered brass, bronze, and copper. The composition of the patina can vary, in a maritime environment depending on the environment a basic chloride may be present, in an urban environment basic sulfates may be present.Encyclopedia Of Corrosion Technology (Google eBook), Philip A. Schweitzer P.E.; CRC Press, 2004, This compound is often improperly called (even in chemistry articles) copper carbonate, cupric carbonate, and similar names. The true (neutral) copper(II) carbonate CuCO3 is not known to occur naturally. It is decomposed by water or moisture from the air, and was synthesized only in 1973 by high temperature and very high pressures.

Though her two sisters eventually went to the Netherlands' Rotterdam Zoo, Elsa was trained by the Adamsons to survive on her own, and was eventually released into the wild. Her story is told in several books by the Adamsons, as well as the 1966 motion picture Born Free.  Life  Elsa and her sisters were orphaned on February 1, 1956 after George Adamson was forced to kill their mother when she charged him, in defence of her three cubs. George only later realised why the lioness had acted so aggressively towards him. George and his wife Joy then adopted the lioness‚Äôs four-day-old cubs. While Elsa lived in many ways like a domesticated pet when she was small, Joy Adamson, whom Elsa trusted the most, considered her relationship with Elsa to be that of equals. Indeed, after sending the other two to a zoo, Joy was fiercely determined to give Elsa the education she needed to hunt and live in the wild. Her efforts paid off, earning Elsa worldwide fame at the time, when her early life‚Äôs story was published in the book Born Free. When Elsa was three years old, she brought three cubs of her own to show to the Adamsons, whom the Adamsons named \\"Jespah\\" (male), \\"Gopa\\" (male), and \\"Little Elsa\\" (female). The life of Elsa and her cubs is covered in the book Living Free, published not long afterwards. Elsa died prematurely of a form of babesiosis, a tick-borne blood disease similar to malaria which often infects the cat family. Elsa‚Äôs grave is in the Meru National Park. She died as local sentiment had begun to turn against Elsa and her cubs, forcing the Adamsons to consider moving them. Elsa‚Äôs death made her cubs much more averse to human contact, even with the Adamsons themselves, complicating what would be their eventual capture and release in the Serengeti. The fate of the cubs upon their release was uncertain, though George Adamson was able to find Little Elsa, healthy and in the company of two other unrelated lions, during 19 months of subsequent searching.Adamson, George. A Lifetime With Lions. New York: Avon Books, 1968. This was the last time that the Adamsons saw any of Elsa's cubs.

He served as Chancellor of Germany in 1932 and as Vice-Chancellor under Adolf Hitler from 1933 to 1934. Born into a wealthy family of Westphalian Roman Catholic aristocrats, Papen served in the Imperial German Army from 1898 onward and was trained as a German General Staff officer. He served as military attach√© in Mexico and the United States from 1913 to 1915, organising acts of sabotage in the United States and financing Mexican forces in the Mexican Revolution. After being expelled from the United States in 1915, he served as a battalion commander on the Western Front of World War I and finished his war service in the Middle Eastern theatre as a lieutenant colonel. Appointed Chancellor in 1932 by President Paul von Hindenburg, Papen ruled by presidential decree. He negotiated the end of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932. He launched the Preu√üenschlag coup against the Social Democratic government of the Free State of Prussia. His failure to secure a base of support in the Reichstag led to his dismissal by Hindenburg and replacement by General Kurt von Schleicher. Determined to return to power, Papen, believing that Hitler could be controlled once he was in the government, persuaded Hindenburg into appointing Hitler as Chancellor and Papen as Vice-Chancellor in 1933 in a cabinet ostensibly not under Nazi Party domination. With military dictatorship the only alternative to Nazi rule, Hindenburg consented. Papen and his allies were quickly marginalized by Hitler and he left the government after the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, during which the Nazis killed some of his confidants. Subsequently, Papen served as an ambassador of Germany in Vienna from 1934 to 1938 and in Ankara from 1939 to 1944. After the Second World War, Papen was indicted in the Nuremberg trials of war criminals before the International Military Tribunal but was acquitted of all charges. In 1947, a West German denazification court found Papen to have acted as a main culprit in crimes relating to the Nazi government. Papen was given an eight-year hard labour prison sentence but he was released on appeal in 1949. Papen's memoirs were published in 1952 and 1953, and he died in 1969. Early life and education Papen was born into a wealthy and noble Roman Catholic family in Werl, Westphalia, the third child of Friedrich von Papen-K√∂ningen (1839‚Äì1906) and his wife Anna Laura von Steffens (1852‚Äì1939) Papen was sent to a cadet school in Bensberg of his own volition at the age of 11 in 1891. His four years there were followed by three years of training at Prussian Main Military academy in Lichterfelde. He was trained as a Herrenreiter (\\"gentleman rider\\"). He served for a period as a military attendant in the Kaiser's Palace and as a second lieutenant in his father's old unit, the Westphalian Uhlan Regiment No. 5 in D√ºsseldorf. Papen joined the German General Staff as a captain in March 1913. He married Martha von Boch-Galhau (1880‚Äì1961) on 3 May 1905. Papen's wife was the daughter of a wealthy Saarland industrialist whose dowry made him a very rich man. An excellent horseman and a man of much charm, Papen cut a dashing figure and during this time, befriended Kurt von Schleicher. Papen was proud of his family's having been granted hereditary rights since 1298 to mine brine salt at Werl. He always believed in the superiority of the aristocracy over commoners. Fluent in both French and English, he travelled widely all over Europe, the Middle East and North America. He was devoted to Kaiser Wilhelm II. Influenced by the books of General Friedrich von Bernhardi, Papen was a militarist throughout his life. Military attach√© in Washington, DC He entered the diplomatic service in December 1913 as a military attach√© to the German ambassador in the United States. In early 1914 he travelled to Mexico (to which he was also accredited) and observed the Mexican Revolution. At one time, when the anti-Huerta Zapatistas were advancing on Mexico City, Papen organised a group of European volunteers to fight for Mexican General Victoriano Huerta. In the spring of 1914, as German military attach√© to Mexico, Papen was deeply involved in selling arms to the government of General Huerta, believing he could place Mexico in the German sphere of influence, though the collapse of Huerta's regime in July 1914 ended that hope. In April 1914, Papen personally observed the United States occupation of Veracruz when the US seized the city of Veracruz, despite orders from Berlin to stay in Mexico City. During his time in Mexico, Papen acquired the love of international intrigue and adventure that characterised his later diplomatic postings in the United States, Austria and Turkey. On 30 July 1914, Papen arrived in Washington, DC from Mexico to take up his post as German military attach√© to the United States. Von Papen as the German Military Attach√© for Washington, DC in 1915 During the First World War, he tried to buy weapons in the United States for his country, but the UK's blockade made shipping arms to Germany almost impossible. On 22 August 1914, Papen hired US private detective Paul Koeing, based in New York City, to conduct a sabotage and bombing campaign against businesses in New York owned by citizens from the Allied nations. Papen, who was given an unlimited fund of cash to draw on by Berlin, attempted to block the UK, French and Russian governments from buying war supplies in the United States. Papen set up a front company that tried to preclusively purchase every hydraulic press in the US for the next two years to limit artillery shell production by US firms with contracts with the Allies. To enable German citizens living in the Americas to go home to Germany, Papen set up an operation in New York to forge US passports. Starting in September 1914, Papen abused his diplomatic immunity as German military attach√© and US neutrality to start organising plans for an invasion of Canada, as well as a campaign of sabotage against canals, bridges and railroads. In October 1914, Papen became involved in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy, when he contacted anti-UK Indian nationalists living in California, arranging for weapons to be handed over to them. In February 1915, he organised the Vanceboro international bridge bombing, while his diplomatic immunity protected him from arrest. At the same time, he was involved in plans to restore Huerta to power, arranging for the arming and financing of the planned invasion of Mexico. Papen's activities were known to UK intelligence, which shared its information with the US government. As a result he was expelled from the United States for complicity in the planning of acts of sabotage. On 28 December 1915, he was declared persona non grata after his exposure and was recalled to Germany.Current Biography 1941, pp. 651‚Äì653. Upon his return, he was given the Iron Cross. Papen remained involved in plots in the Americas. He contacted in February 1916 the Mexican Colonel Gonzalo Enrile, living in Cuba, in an attempt to arrange German support for F√©lix D√≠az, the would-be strongman of Mexico. Papen served as an intermediary between the Irish Volunteers and the German government regarding the purchase and delivery of arms to be used against the UK during the Easter Rising of 1916. He served as an intermediary with Indian nationalists as well. In April 1916, a US federal grand jury issued an indictment against Papen for a plot to explode Canada's Welland Canal; he remained under indictment until he became Chancellor of Germany, at which time the charges were dropped. Army service in World War I As a Roman Catholic, Papen belonged to the Zentrum, the right of the center party that almost all German Catholics supported, but during the course of the war, the nationalist conservative Papen became estranged from his party. Papen disapproved of Matthias Erzberger, whose efforts to pull the Zentrum to the left, he was opposed to and regarded the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 19 July 1917 as almost treason. Later in World War I, Papen returned to the army on active service, first on the Western Front. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the 93rd Regiment of the 4th Guards Infantry Division fighting in Flanders. On 22 August 1916 Papen's battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a UK attack during the Battle of the Somme. Between November 1916‚ÄìFebruary 1917, Papen's battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st Class. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at Vimy Ridge, where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the Canadian Corps. After Vimy, Papen asked for a transfer to the Middle East, which was approved. From June 1917 Papen served as an officer on the General Staff in the Middle East, and then as an officer attached to the Ottoman army in Palestine. During his time in the Ottoman Empire, Papen was in \\"the know\\" about the Armenian genocide, which did not appear to have morally troubled him at all either at the time or later in his life. During his time in Constantinople, Papen befriended Joachim von Ribbentrop. Between October‚ÄìDecember 1917, Papen took part in the heavy fighting in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he returned to Germany and left the army soon after the armistice which halted the fighting in November 1918. After the Turks signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 October 1918, the German Asia Corps was ordered home, and Papen was in the mountains at Karapunar when he heard on 11 November 1918 that the war was over. The new republic ordered soldier's councils to be organised in the German Army, including the Asian corps, which General Otto Liman von Sanders attempted to obey, and which Papen refused to obey. Sanders ordered Papen arrested for his insubordination, which caused Papen to leave his post without permission as he fled to Germany in civilian clothing to personally meet Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who had the charges dropped. Catholic politician After leaving the German Army in the spring of 1919, Papen purchased a country estate, the Haus Merfeld, living the life of a \\"gentleman farmer\\" in D√ºlmen. In April 1920, during the Communist uprising in the Ruhr, Papen took command of a Freikorps unit to protect Roman Catholicism from the \\"Red marauders\\". Impressed with his leadership of his Freikorps unit, Papen decided to pursue a career in politics. In the fall of 1920, the president of the Westphalian Farmer's Association, Baron Engelbert von Kerkerinck zur Borg, told Papen his association would campaign for him if he ran for the Prussian Landtag. Papen entered politics and joined the Centre Party, better known as the Zentrum. The monarchist Papen formed part of the conservative wing of the party that rejected democracy and the Weimar Coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Papen's politics were much closer to the German National People's Party than to the Zentrum, and he seems to have belonged to the Zentrum on the account of his Roman Catholicism and a hope that he could shift his party to the right. Papen was a figure of influence in the Zentrum by the virtue of being the largest shareholder and chief of the editorial board in the party's Catholic newspaper Germania, which was the most prestigious of the Catholic papers in Germany. Papen was a member of the Landtag of Prussia from 1921 to 1928 and from 1930 to 1932, representing a rural, Catholic constituency in Westphalia. Papen rarely attended the sessions of the Landtag and never spoke at the meetings during his time as a Landtag deputy. Papen tried to have his name entered into the Zentrum party list for the Reichstag elections of May 1924, but was blocked by the Zentrum's leadership. In February 1925, Papen was one of the six Zentrum deputies in the Landtag who voted with the German National People's Party and the German People's Party against the SPD-Zentrum government. Papen was nearly expelled from the Zentrum for breaking with party discipline in the Landtag. In the 1925 presidential elections, he surprised his party by supporting the right- wing candidate Paul von Hindenburg over Wilhelm Marx. Papen, along with two of his future cabinet ministers, was a member of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck's exclusive Berlin Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentlemen's Club). In March 1930, Papen welcomed the coming of presidential government. As the presidential government of chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning depended upon the Social Democrats in the Reichstag to \\"tolerate\\" it by not voting to cancel laws passed under Article 48, Papen grew more critical. In a speech before a group of farmers in October 1931, Papen called for Br√ºning to disallow the SPD and base his presidential government on \\"tolerance\\" from the NSDAP instead. Papen demanded that Br√ºning transform the \\"concealed dictatorship\\" of a presidential government into a dictatorship that would unite all of the German right under its banner. In the March‚ÄìApril 1932 German presidential election, Papen voted for Hindenburg on the grounds he was the best man to unite the right, while in the Prussian Landtag's election of speaker of the Landtag, Papen voted for the Nazi Hans Kerrl. Chancellorship Chancellor Papen (left) with his eventual successor, Minister of Defence Kurt von Schleicher, watching a horse race in Berlin-Karlshorst. On 1 June 1932, Papen was suddenly lifted to supreme importance when president Hindenburg appointed him Chancellor. Papen owed his appointment to the Chancellorship to General Kurt von Schleicher, an old friend from the pre-war General Staff and influential advisor of President Hindenburg. Schleicher selected Papen because his conservative, aristocratic background and military career was satisfactory to Hindenburg and would create the groundwork for a possible Centre-Nazi coalition. Schleicher, who became Defence Minister, selected the entire cabinet himself. The day before, Papen had promised party chairman Ludwig Kaas he would not accept any appointment. After he broke his pledge, Kaas branded him the \\"Ephialtes of the Centre Party\\"; Papen forestalled being expelled from the party by leaving it on 31 May 1932. The cabinet that Papen formed was known as the \\"cabinet of barons\\" or \\"cabinet of monocles\\". Papen had little support in the Reichstag; the only parties committed to supporting him was the far-right/national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and the Conservative-Liberal German People's Party. The Centre Party would not support Papen because he had backstabbed Br√ºning. Schleicher's planned Centre-Nazi coalition thus failed to materialize and the Nazis now had little reason to prop up Papen's weak government. Papen grew very close to Hindenburg and first met Adolf Hitler in June 1932. Papen's cabinet (2 June 1932) Papen consented on 31 May to Hitler's and Hindenburg's agreement of 30 May that the Nazi Party would tolerate Papen's government if fresh elections were called, the Sturmabteilung ban was canceled and the Nazis were granted access to the radio network. As agreed, the Papen government dissolved the Reichstag on 4 June and called a national election by 31 July 1932, in the hope that the Nazis would win the largest number of seats in the Reichstag, which would allow him the majority he needed to establish an authoritarian government. In a so-called \\"presidential government\\", Papen would rule by Article 48, having emergency decrees signed into effect by President Hindenburg. On 16 June 1932, the new government lifted the ban on the SA and the SS, eliminating the last remaining rationale for Nazi support for Papen. Papen in June 1932. In June and July 1932 Papen represented Germany at the Lausanne conference where, on 9 July, German reparation obligations were cancelled. Germany had ceased paying reparations in June 1931 under the Hoover moratorium, and most of the groundwork for the Lausanne conference had been done by Br√ºning, but Papen took the credit for the success. In exchange for cancelling reparations, Germany was supposed to make a one-time payment of 3 million Reichmarks to France, a commitment that Papen repudiated immediately upon his return to Berlin.Nicolls, Anthony Weimar and the Rise of Hitler, London: Macmillan 2000 page 156. Through Article 48, Papen enacted economic policies on 4 September that cut the payments offered by the unemployment insurance fund, subjected jobless Germans seeking unemployment insurance to a means test, lowered wages (including those reached by collective bargaining), while arranging tax cuts for corporations and the rich. These austerity policies made Papen deeply unpopular with the masses but had the backing of the business elite. Negotiations between the Nazis, the Centre Party and Papen for a new Prussian government began on 8 June but broke down due to the Centre Party's hostility to the party deserter Papen. On 11 July 1932 Papen received the support of the cabinet and the president for a decree allowing the Reich government to take over the Prussian government, which was dominated by the SPD, in a move that was later justified through the rumour that the Social Democrats and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) were planning a merger. The political violence of the so-called Altona Bloody Sunday between Nazis, communists and the police on 17 July, gave Papen his pretext. On 20 July, Papen launched a coup against the SPD coalition government of Prussia in the so-called Preu√üenschlag (Putsch in Prussia). Berlin was put on military shutdown and Papen sent men to arrest the SPD Prussian authorities, whom he accused with no evidence of being in league with the Communists. Hereafter, Papen declared himself commissioner of Prussia by way of another emergency decree that he elicited from Hindenburg, further weakening the democracy of the Weimar Republic. Papen viewed the coup as a gift to the Nazis, who had been informed of it by 9 July, who were now supposed to support his government. On 23 July, Papen had German representatives walk out of the World Disarmament Conference after the French delegation warned that allowing Germany Gleichberechtigung (\\"equality of status\\") in armaments would lead to another world war. Papen announced that the Reich would not return to the conference until the other powers agreed to consider his demand for Gleichberechtigung. Papen arriving for the Reichstag session of 12 September 1932. In the Reichstag election of 31 July the Nazis won the largest number of seats. To combat the rise in SA and SS political terrorism that began right after the elections, Papen on 9 August brought in via Article 48 a new law that drastically streamlined the judicial process in death penalty cases while limiting the right of appeal. New special courts were also created. A few hours later in the town of Potempa, five SA men killed the Communist labourer Konrad Pietrzuch in the Potempa Murder of 1932. The \\"Potempa five\\" were promptly arrested and then convicted and sentenced to death on 23 August by a special court. The Potempa case generated enormous media attention, and on 2 September, Papen in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for Prussia reduced the sentences of the five SA men down to life imprisonment after Hitler made it clear that he would not support Papen's government if they were executed. On 11 August, the public holiday of Constitution Day, which commemorated the adoption of the Weimar Constitution in 1919, Papen and his Interior Minister Baron Wilhelm von Gayl called a press conference to announce plans for a new constitution that would, in effect, turn Germany into a dictatorship. Two days later, Schleicher and Papen offered Hitler the position of Vice-Chancellor, who rejected it. G√∂ring (right) When the new Reichstag assembled on 12 September, Papen hoped to destroy the growing alliance between the Nazis and the Centre Party. That day at the president's estate in Neudeck, Papen, Schleicher and Gayl obtained in advance from Hindenburg a decree to dissolve parliament, then secured another decree to suspend elections beyond the constitutional 60 days. The Communists made a motion of no confidence in the Papen government. Papen had anticipated this move by the Communists, but been assured that there would be an immediate objection. However, when no one objected, Papen placed the red folder containing the dissolution decree on Reichstag president Hermann G√∂ring's desk. He demanded the floor in order to read it, but G√∂ring pretended not to see him; the Nazis and the Centre Party had decided to support the Communist motion. The motion carried by 512 votes to 42. Realizing that he did not have nearly enough support to go through with his plan to suspend elections, Papen decided to call another election to punish the Reichstag for the vote of no- confidence. Papen and Schleicher in 1932 On 27 October, the Supreme Court of Germany issued a ruling that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal, but allowed Papen to retain his control of Prussia. In November 1932, Papen violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six battleships, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas and 16 U-boats, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. In the November 1932 election the Nazis lost seats, but Papen was still unable to secure a Reichstag that could be counted on not to pass another vote of no-confidence in his government. Papen's attempt to negotiate with Hitler failed. Under pressure from Schleicher, Papen resigned on 17 November and formed a caretaker government. Papen told his cabinet that he planned to have martial law declared, which would allow him to rule as a dictator.. However, at a cabinet meeting on 2 December, Papen was informed by Schleicher's associate General Eugen Ott that Ministry of the Reichswehr war games showed there was no way to maintain order against the Nazis and Communists. Realizing that Schleicher was moving to replace him, Papen asked Hindenburg to fire Schleicher as defence minister. Instead, Hindenburg appointed Schleicher as chancellor. Bringing Hitler to power After his resignation, Papen regularly visited Hindenburg, missing no opportunity to attack Schleicher in these visits. Schleicher had promised Hindenburg that he would never attack Papen in public when he became Chancellor, but in a bid to distance himself from the very unpopular Papen, Schleicher in a series of speeches in December 1932-January 1933 did just that, upsetting Hindenburg. Papen was embittered by the way his former best friend, Schleicher, had brought him down, and was determined to become Chancellor again. On 4 January 1933, Hitler and Papen met in secret at the banker Baron Kurt Baron von Schr√∂der's house in Cologne to discuss a common strategy against Schleicher. On 9 January 1933, Papen and Hindenburg agreed to form a new government that would bring in Hitler. On the evening of 22 January in a meeting at the villa of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin, Papen made the concession of abandoning his claim to the Chancellorship and committed to support Hitler as Chancellor in a proposed \\"Government of National Concentration\\", in which Papen would serve as Vice-Chancellor and Minister- President of Prussia. On 23 January, Papen presented to Hindenburg his idea for Hitler to be made Chancellor, while keeping him \\"boxed\\" in. On the same day Schleicher, to avoid a vote of no-confidence in the Reichstag when it reconvened on 31 January, asked the president to declare a state of emergency. Hindenburg declined and Schleicher resigned at midday on 28 January. Hindenburg formally gave Papen the task of forming a new government. The Hitler Cabinet on 30 January 1933. In the morning of 29 January, Papen met with Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring at his apartment, where it was agreed that Papen would serve as Vice-Chancellor and Commissioner for Prussia. It was in the same meeting that Papen first learned that Hitler wanted to dissolve the Reichstag when he became Chancellor and, once the Nazis had won a majority of the seats in the ensuing elections, to activate the Enabling Act. In the end, the President, who had previously vowed never to let Hitler become Chancellor, appointed Hitler to the post at 11.30 am on 30 January 1933, with Papen as Vice-Chancellor. While Papen's intrigues appeared to have brought Hitler into power, the crucial dynamic was in fact provided by the Nazi Party's electoral support, which made military dictatorship the only alternative to Nazi rule for Hindenburg and his circle. At the formation of Hitler's cabinet on 30 January, only three Nazis held cabinet portfolios: Hitler, G√∂ring, and Wilhelm Frick. The other eight posts were held by conservatives close to Papen. Additionally, as part of the deal that allowed Hitler to become Chancellor, Papen was granted the right to attend every meeting between Hitler and Hindenburg. Moreover, Cabinet decisions were made by majority vote. Papen believed that his conservative friends' majority in the Cabinet and his closeness to Hindenburg would keep Hitler in check. Vice-Chancellor Hitler and his allies instead quickly marginalised Papen and the rest of the cabinet. For example, as part of the deal between Hitler and Papen, G√∂ring had been appointed interior minister of Prussia, thus putting the largest police force in Germany under Nazi control. He frequently acted without consulting his nominal superior, Papen. On 1 February 1933, Hitler presented to the cabinet an Article 48 decree law that had been drafted by Papen in November 1932 allowing the police to take people into \\"protective custody\\" without charges. It was signed into law by Hindenburg on 4 February as the \\"Decree for the Protection of the German People\\". On the evening of 27 February 1933, Papen joined Hitler, G√∂ring and Goebbels at the burning Reichstag and told him that he shared their belief that this was the signal for Communist revolution. On 18 March 1933, in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for Prussia, Papen freed the \\"Potempa Five\\" under the grounds the murder of Konrad Pietzuch was an act of self-defense, making the five SA men \\"innocent victims\\" of a miscarriage of justice. Neither Papen nor his conservative allies waged a fight against the Reichstag Fire Decree in late February or the Enabling Act in March. After the Enabling Act was passed, serious deliberations more or less ceased at cabinet meetings when they took place at all, which subsequently neutralised Papen's attempt to \\"box\\" Hitler in through cabinet-based decision-making. Papen endorsed Hitler's plan presented at a cabinet meeting on 7 March 1933 to destroy the Zentrum by severing the Catholic Church from the Zentrum. This was the origin of the Reichskonkordat that Papen was to negotiate with the Roman Catholic Church later in the spring of 1933. Papen founded a new political party on 5 April 1933 called the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle, which was intended as a conservative Catholic party that would hold the NSDAP in check while at the same time working with the NSDAP. Both the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party declined to merge into Papen's new party while the rival Coalition of Catholic Germans which was sponsored by the NSDAP proved more effective at recruiting German Catholics. Papen at the signing of the Reichskonkordat in Rome on 20 July 1933. On 8 April Papen travelled to the Vatican to offer a 'Reichskonkordat' that defined the German state's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. During his stay in Rome, Papen met the Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini and failed to persuade him to drop his support for the Austrian chancellor Dollfuss. Papen was euphoric at the Reichskonkordat that he negotiated with Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli in Rome, believing that this was a diplomatic success that restored his status in Germany, guaranteed the rights of German Catholics in the Third Reich, and required the disbandment of the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party, thereby achieving one of Papen's main political goals since June 1932. During Papen's absence, the Nazified Landtag of Prussia elected G√∂ring as prime minister on 10 April. Papen saw the end of the Zentrum that he had engineered as one of his greatest achievements. Later in May 1933, he was forced to disband the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle owing to lack of public interest. Papen with Hitler on 1 May 1933 In September 1933, Papen visited Budapest to meet the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, and to discuss how Germany and Hungary might best co-operate against Czechoslovakia. The Hungarians wanted the volksdeutsche (ethnic German) minorities in the Banat, Transylvania, Slovakia and Carpathia to agitate to return to Hungary in co- operation with the Magyar minorities, a demand that Papen refused to meet. In September 1933, when the Soviet Union ended its secret military co-operation with Germany, the Soviets justified their move under the grounds that Papen had informed the French of the Soviet support for German violations of the Versailles Treaty. On 14 November 1933, Papen was appointed the Reich Commissioner for the Saar. The Saarland was under the rule of the League of Nations and a referendum was scheduled for 1935 under which the Saarlanders had the option to return to Germany, join France, or retain the status quo. As a conservative Catholic whose wife was from the Saarland, Papen had much understanding of the heavily Catholic region, and Papen gave numerous speeches urging the Saarlanders to vote to return to Germany. Papen was successful in persuading the majority of the Catholic clergy in the Saarland to campaign for a return to Germany, and 90% of the Saarland voted to return to Germany in the 1935 referendum. Papen began covert talks with other conservative forces with the aim of convincing Hindenburg to restore the balance of power back to the conservatives. By May 1934, it had become clear that Hindenburg was dying, with doctors telling Papen that the President only had a few months left to live. Papen together with Otto Meissner, Hindenburg's chief of staff, and Major Oskar von Hindenburg, Hindenburg's son, drafted a \\"political will and last testament\\", which the President signed on 11 May 1934. At Papen's request, the will called for the dismissal of certain Nazi ministers from the cabinet, and regular cabinet meetings, which would have achieved Papen's plan of January 1933 for a broad governing coalition of the right. = The Marburg speech = With the Army command recently having hinted at the need for Hitler to control the SA, Papen delivered an address at the University of Marburg on 17 June 1934 where he called for the restoration of some freedoms, demanded an end to the calls for a \\"second revolution\\" and advocated the cessation of SA terror in the streets. Papen intended to \\"tame\\" Hitler with the Marburg speech, and gave the speech without any effort at co-ordination beforehand with either Hindenburg or the Reichswehr. The speech was crafted by Papen's speech writer, Edgar Julius Jung, with the assistance of Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose and Catholic leader Erich Klausener, and Papen had first seen the text of the speech only two hours before he delivered it at the University of Marburg. The \\"Marburg speech\\" was well received by the graduating students of Marburg university who all loudly cheered the Vice-Chancellor. Extracts from speech were reproduced in the Frankfurter Zeitung, the most prestigious newspaper in Germany and from there picked up by the foreign press. The speech incensed Hitler, and its publication was suppressed by the Propaganda Ministry. Papen told Hitler that unless the ban on the Marburg speech was lifted and Hitler declared himself willing to follow the line recommended by Papen in the speech, he would resign and would inform Hindenburg why he had resigned. Hitler outwitted Papen by telling him that he agreed with all of the criticism of his regime made in the Marburg speech; told him Goebbels was wrong to ban the speech and he would have the ban lifted at once; and promised that the SA would be put in their place, provided Papen agreed not to resign and would meet with Hindenburg in a joint interview with him. Papen accepted Hitler's suggestions. = Night of the Long Knives = Goebbels, and Hess. Only Himmler and Heydrich are missing. Two weeks after the Marburg speech, Hitler responded to the armed forces' demands to suppress the ambitions of Ernst R√∂hm and the SA by purging the SA leadership. The purge, known as the Night of the Long Knives, took place between 30 June and 2 July 1934. Though Papen's bold speech against some of the excesses committed by the Nazis had angered Hitler, the latter was aware that he could not act directly against the Vice-Chancellor without offending Hindenburg. Instead, in the Night of the Long Knives, the Vice-Chancellery, Papen's office, was ransacked by the Schutzstaffel (SS); his associates Herbert von Bose, Erich Klausener and Edgar Julius Jung were shot. Papen himself was placed under house arrest at his villa with his telephone line cut. Some accounts indicate that this \\"protective custody\\" was ordered by G√∂ring, who felt the ex-diplomat could be useful in the future. Reportedly Papen arrived at the Chancellery, exhausted from days of house arrest without sleep, to find the Chancellor seated with other Nazi ministers around a round table, with no place for him but a hole in the middle. He insisted on a private audience with Hitler and announced his resignation, stating, \\"My service to the Fatherland is over!\\" The following day, Papen's resignation as Vice-Chancellor was formally accepted and publicised, with no successor appointed. When Hindenburg died on 2 August, the last conservative obstacles to complete Nazi rule were gone. Ambassador to Austria Papen at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in July 1934, just before departing for Vienna. Hitler offered Papen the assignment of German ambassador to Vienna, which Papen accepted. Papen was a German nationalist who always believed that Austria was destined to join Germany in an Anschluss and felt that a success in bringing that about might restore his career. During his time as ambassador to Austria, Papen stood outside the normal chain of command of the Ausw√§rtige Amt (Foreign Office) as he refused to take orders from Konstantin von Neurath, his own former Foreign Minister. Instead, Papen reported directly to Hitler.Kallis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000 page 81. Papen met often with Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg to assure him that Germany did not wish to annex his country, and only wanted the banned Austrian Nazi Party to participate in Austrian politics. In late 1934-early 1935, Papen took a break from his duties as German ambassador in Vienna to lead the Deutsche Front (\\"German Front\\") in the Saarland plebiscite on 13 January 1935, where the League of Nations observers monitoring the vote noted Papen's \\"ruthless methods\\" as he campaigned for the region to return to Germany. Papen on his way to Berchtesgaden, 21 February 1938. Papen also contributed to achieving Hitler's goal of undermining Austrian sovereignty and bringing about the Anschluss (annexation by Germany).Churchill, W. (1948). The Gathering Storm, p. 132. On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian government, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on Germany's. Papen played a major role in negotiating the 1936 Austro-German agreement under which Austria declared itself a \\"German state\\" whose foreign policy would always be aligned with Berlin's and allowed for members of the \\"national opposition\\" to enter the Austrian cabinet in exchange for which the Austrian Nazis abandoned their terrorist campaign against the government. The treaty Papen signed in Vienna on 11 July 1936 promised that Germany would not seek to annex Austria and largely placed Austria in the German sphere of influence, greatly reducing Italian influence on Austria. In July 1936, Papen reported to Hitler that the Austro-German treaty he had just signed was the \\"decisive step\\" towards ending Austrian independence, and it was only a matter of time before the Anschluss took place. In the summer and fall of 1937, Papen pressured the Austrians to include more Nazis in the government. In September 1937, Papen returned to Berlin when Benito Mussolini visited Germany, serving as Hitler's adviser on Italo-German talks about Austria. Though Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden. The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg at the meeting on 12 February 1938 led to the Austrian government's capitulation to German threats and pressure, and paved the way for the Anschluss. Ambassador to Turkey Papen later served the German government as Ambassador to Turkey from 1939 to 1944. In April 1938, after the retirement of the previous ambassador, Frederich von Keller on his 65th birthday, the German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop attempted to appoint Papen as ambassador in Ankara, but the appointment was vetoed by the Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste when he had served alongside him in World War I. In November 1938 and in February 1939, the new Turkish president General ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º again vetoed Ribbentrop's attempts to have Papen appointed as German ambassador to Turkey. In April 1939, Turkey accepted Papen as ambassador. Papen was keen to return to Turkey, where he had served during World War I. Papen arrived in Turkey on 27 April 1939, just after the signing of a UK- Turkish declaration of friendship. ƒ∞n√∂n√º wanted Turkey to join the UK-inspired \\"peace front\\" that was meant to stop Germany. On 24 June 1939, France and Turkey signed a declaration committing them to upholding collective security in the Balkans. On 21 August 1939, Papen presented Turkey with a diplomatic note threatening economic sanctions and the cancellation of all arms contacts if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the UK-French \\"peace front\\", a threat that Turkey rebuffed. On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and two days later on 3 September 1939 the UK and France declared war on Germany. Papen claimed later to have been opposed to Hitler's foreign policy in 1939 and was very depressed when he heard the news of the German attack on Poland on the radio. Papen continued his work of representing the Reich in Turkey under the grounds that resigning in protest \\"would indicate the moral weakening in Germany\\", which was something he could never do. On 19 October 1939, Papen suffered a notable setback when Turkey signed a treaty of alliance with France and the UK. During the Phoney War, the conservative Catholic Papen found himself to his own discomfort working together with Soviet diplomats in Ankara to pressure Turkey not to enter the war on the Allied side. In June 1940, with France's defeat, ƒ∞n√∂n√º abandoned his pro-Allied neutrality, and Papen's influence in Ankara dramatically increased. Between 1940 and 1942 Papen signed three economic agreements that placed Turkey in the German economic sphere of influence. Papen hinted more than once to Turkey that Germany was prepared to support Bulgarian claims to Thrace if Turkey did not prove more accommodating to Germany. In May 1941, when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the UK in the Anglo-Iraqi War, Papen persuaded Turkey to allow arms in Syria to be shipped along a railroad linking Syria to Iraq.Hale, William Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000, London: Psychology Press, 2000 page 87 In June 1941, Papen successfully negotiated a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with Turkey, signed on 17 June 1941, which prevented Turkey from entering the war on the Allied side. After Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941, Papen persuaded Turkey to close the Turkish straits to Soviet warships, but was unable to have the straits closed to Soviet merchant ships as he demanded. Papen claimed after the war to have done everything within his power to save Turkish Jews living in countries occupied by Germany from deportation to the death camps, but an examination of the Ausw√§rtige Amt's records do not support him. During the war, Papen used his connections with Turkish Army officers with whom he served in World War I to try to influence Turkey into joining the Axis, held parties at the German embassy which were attended by leading Turkish politicians and used \\"special funds\\" to bribe Turks into following a pro-German line. As an ambassador to Turkey, Papen survived a Soviet assassination attempt on 24 February 1942 by agents from the NKVD:Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness‚ÄîA Soviet Spymaster (Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1994), a bomb exploded prematurely, killing the bomber and no one else, although Papen was slightly injured. In 1943, Papen frustrated a UK attempt to have Turkey join the war on the Allied side by getting Hitler to send a letter to In√∂n√º assuring him that Germany had no interest in invading Turkey and by threatening to have the Luftwaffe bomb Istanbul if Turkey joined the Allies. In the summer and fall of 1943, realising the war was lost, Papen attended secret meetings with the agents of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Istanbul.Bauer, Yehuda Jews for Sale?: Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933-1945, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996 page 134. Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for US support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt rejected the offer when he heard of it and told the OSS to stop talking to Papen.Bauer, Yehuda Jews for Sale?: Nazi- Jewish Negotiations, 1933-1945, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996 page 125. From October 1943, Papen and the German embassy gained access to the \\"Cicero\\" documents of Elyesa Bazna, including information on Operation Overlord and the Tehran Conference, which Papen revealed selectively to In√∂nu to strain Allied-Turkish relations.Wires, Richard The Cicero Spy Affair: German Access to British Secrets in World War II, Westport: Greenwood Publishing, 1999 page 49. In January 1944, Papen, after learning via the \\"Cicero\\" documents of a UK plan to have the Royal Air Force use airfields in Turkey to bomb the oil fields of Ploie»ôti in Romania, told the Turkish foreign minister H√ºseyin Numan Menemencioƒülu that if Turkey allowed the RAF to use Turkish air fields to bomb Ploie»ôti, the Luftwaffe would use its bases in Bulgaria and Greece to bomb and destroy Istanbul and Izmir. On 20 April 1944, Turkey, wishing to ingratiate itself with the Allies, ceased selling chromium to Germany.Hale, William Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000, London: Psychology Press, 2000 pages 100 On 26 May 1944 Menemencioƒülu announced that Turkey was reducing exports to Germany by 50%, and on 2 August 1944 Turkey severed diplomatic relations with Germany, forcing Papen to return to Berlin.Hale, William Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000, London: Psychology Press, 2000 pages 91 After Pope Pius XI died in February 1939, his successor Pope Pius XII did not renew Papen's honorary title of Papal chamberlain. As nuncio, the future Pope John XXIII, Angelo Roncalli, became acquainted with Papen in Greece and Turkey during World War II. The German government considered appointing Papen ambassador to the Holy See, but Pope Pius XII, after consulting Konrad von Preysing, Bishop of Berlin, rejected this proposal. In August 1944, Papen had his last meeting with Hitler after arriving back in Germany from Turkey. Here, Hitler awarded Papen the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross.Franz von Papen, Memoirs, p. 532. In September 1944, Papen settled at his estate at Wallerfangen in the Saarland that had been given to him by his father-in-law. On 29 November 1944, Papen could hear in the distance the guns of the advancing US Third Army, which caused him and his family to flee deeper into Germany. Post-war years Papen at the Nuremberg Trials. Papen was captured along with his son Franz Jr. at his own home by First Lieutenant Thomas McKinley and members of the US 194th Glider Infantry Regiment, on 14 April 1945. Also present during the capture was a small band from the 550th Airborne glider Infantry. Papen was forced by the US to visit a concentration camp to see firsthand the nature of the regime he had served from start to finish and had fostered. Papen in April 1964 Papen was one of the defendants at the main Nuremberg War Crimes Trial. The investigating tribunal found no solid evidence to support claims that Papen had been involved in the annexation of Austria. The court acquitted him, stating that while he had committed a number of \\"political immoralities,\\" these actions were not punishable under the \\"conspiracy to commit crimes against peace\\" written in Papen's indictment. Papen was subsequently sentenced to eight years' hard labour by a West German denazification court, but he was released on appeal in 1949. Until 1954, Papen was forbidden to publish in West Germany, and so he wrote a series of articles in newspapers in Spain, attacking the Federal Republic from a conservative Catholic position in much the same terms that he had attacked the Weimar Republic. Papen unsuccessfully tried to restart his political career in the 1950s; he lived at the Castle of Benzenhofen near Ravensburg in Upper Swabia. Pope John XXIII restored his title of Papal Chamberlain on 24 July 1959. Papen was also a Knight of Malta, and he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Pontifical Order of Pius IX. Von Papen's grave in Wallerfangen, Saarland Papen published a number of books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early Western Cold War politics. Papen praised the Schuman Plan as \\"wise and statesmanlike\\" and believed in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe.Franz von Papen, Memoirs, pp. 586‚Äì587. In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland. Right up until his death in 1969, Papen gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers, defending himself against the charge that he had played a crucial role in having Hitler appointed Chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime; these led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists. Franz von Papen died in Obersasbach, West Germany, on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.  Publications  * Appell an das deutsche Gewissen.

A system context diagram (SCD) in engineering is a diagram that defines the boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it.Manoj Kumar Choubey (2012) IT Infrastructure and Management (For the GBTU and MMTU). p. 53 This diagram is a high level view of a system. It is similar to a block diagram.  Overview  System context diagrams show a system, as a whole and its inputs and outputs from/to external factors. According to Kossiakoff and Sweet (2011):Alexander Kossiakoff, William N. Sweet (2011). Systems Engineering: Principles and Practices p. 266 System context diagrams are used early in a project to get agreement on the scope under investigation.Richard Wiener (1998) Journal of Object-oriented Programming. Vol 11. p. 68 Context diagrams are typically included in a requirements document. These diagrams must be read by all project stakeholders and thus should be written in plain language, so the stakeholders can understand items within the document.  Building blocks  Context diagrams can be developed with the use of two types of building blocks: * Entities (Actors): labeled boxes; one in the center representing the system, and around it multiple boxes for each external actor * Relationships: labeled lines between the entities and system For example, \\"customer places order.\\" Context diagrams can also use many different drawing types to represent external entities. They can use ovals, stick figures, pictures, clip art or any other representation to convey meaning. Decision trees and data storage are represented in system flow diagrams. A context diagram can also list the classifications of the external entities as one of a set of simple categoriesSuzanne Robertson, James C. Robertson (2006) Mastering the Requirements Process. Pearson Education, 17 mrt. 2006 (Examples:System Goal Modelling using the i*: Approach in RESCUE Centre HCI Design, 27 February 2003), which add clarity to the level of involvement of the entity with regards to the system. These categories include: * Active: Dynamic to achieve some goal or purpose (Examples: \\"Article readers\\" or \\"customers\\"). * Passive: Static external entities which infrequently interact with the system (Examples: \\"Article editors\\" or \\"database administrator\\"). * Cooperative: Predictable external entities which are used by the system to bring about some desired outcome (Examples: \\"Internet service providers\\" or \\"shipping companies\\"). * Autonomous (Independent): External entities which are separated from the system, but affect the system indirectly, by means of imposed constraints or similar influences (Examples: \\"regulatory committees\\" or \\"standards groups\\").  Alternatives  The best system context diagrams are used to display how a system interoperates at a very high level, or how systems operate and interact logically. The system context diagram is a necessary tool in developing a baseline interaction between systems and actors; actors and a system or systems and systems. Alternatives to the system context diagram are: Example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram. * Architecture Interconnect Diagram: The figure gives an example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram: A representation of the Albuquerque regional ITS architecture interconnects for the Albuquerque Police Department that was generated using the Turbo Architecture tool is shown in the figure.

The company is most known for its publication of the first volume of Megatokyo, a prominent webcomic, as well as the flamboyant style of one of its founders, Steve Bennett. The company was also known for regular turmoil within its wake, primarily during the years 2001‚Äì2003. One of these led to a period where the company did business under a different name as I.C. Entertainment. The company, commonly referred to as \\"Ironcat\\", published under the Studio Ironcat, I.C. Entertainment and Fuzzy Kitten imprints. They also had an adult imprint, Sexy Fruit. Over the course of its lifespan, Studio Ironcat published over fifty titles. History =Founding years= From 1993 to 1997, Antarctic Press published several translated manga series, including Vampire Miyu and several miniseries by Ippongi Bang and her studio, Studio DoDo. However, facing declining sales and a change in the company's focus, Antarctic Press decided to cancel all of their translated manga titles in late 1997, laying off several employees in the process. One of the employees let go from Antarctic Press was head translator Kumi Kimura, who took several projects that had been in the planning stages to his new company, Studio Ironcat. Studio Ironcat was founded in 1997 by manga artists Kuni Kimura, Masaomi Kanzaki and Stephen R. Bennett IV. The new company started publication in January of the following year by releasing the Vampire Princess Miyu manga by Narumi Kakinouchi, then moving on to a series of other books under its Studio Ironcat and Sexy Fruit imprints. The company signed up other well-known artists and titles, working to become a strong player in the sh≈çnen manga genre. For the first few years of business, things were running somewhat smoothly, but this changed in 1999, with the first major problem for Ironcat. =Embezzlement and departure of co-founders= From its inception until 1999, there were financial issues with Kimura. A report by industry website Anime News Network (ANN) stated that a company employee reported multiple cases of fraud by Kimura, with the alleged cases of Ironcat funds being given to friends in Japan, took unauthorized trips to Thailand and frequently used company finances for personal expenses. The drain of funds was enough that the company ended up on shaky financial ground, and emptied Kanzaki (the primary financial backer)'s investment in the company. On July 15, 1999 Kanzaki and Bennett fired Kimura, bringing on Steve Bennett's brother Kevin Bennett and their father, Stephen Bennett III, as Ironcat executives. Upon Kimura's departure, an internal investigation took place, and while no conclusive amount was determined, an estimated $15,000 had been allegedly stolen by Kimura from Ironcat coffers. However, no charges were filed against Kimura, who returned to Japan. During the post-Kimura restructuring by Kanzaki and the Bennetts, Office assistant Kathryn Hofer left in January 2000 due to lack of pay and bias treatment, Chief Graphics Designer and Copy Editor Mark Hofmann departed in June 2000, citing an issue with internal, \\"high-school\\" company politics and lack of pay. Hofer's and Hofman's grievances would later prove to be tragically prophetic, as later employee departures would cite the same problems. The company would have further turmoil when the elder Bennett died in late 2000; he had been a key executive in the company and vital to the day- to-day operations. Shortly after Bennett's death, Kanzaki departed Studio Ironcat, taking the rights to his titles as well as the \\"Studio Ironcat\\" name itself (having been named after his manga of the same name), leaving the company nameless, and with an uncertain future. =Name change and employee departures= The Bennetts responded by renaming the company International Comics and Entertainment, but it is unclear if the name change was simply a DBA, or a change to evoke \\"Iron Cat Entertainment\\". For the most part, rebranding the company as I.C. Entertainment was cosmetic, as the company was still referred to as \\"Ironcat\\" during this period. In 2002, the company expanded its lineup to include sh≈çjo manga titles, such as Central City and horror titles such as Mantis Woman. From this point on, a slow exodus of staff departed the company. Between May and August 2003, several key personnel departed the company, with one of the biggest departures occurring on July 31 (though not reported until October 6 of that year). Ten key employees departed, expressing grave personal and professional disagreements with Steve Bennett, with charges of exploitation through unfair work practices and withheld pay. On August 15, 2003, Domestic Affairs Manager Kei Blue, Senior Editor Stephanie Brown and Translator Duane Johnson, as well as four other employees, filed wage claims of over $7000 with the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry, which conducted an investigation of Ironcat, though the results were not made public. On October 6, 2003, Brown, Johnson, and Graphics Editor Ellen Ohlmacher gave an interview to ANN, accusing Bennett of denying pay to themselves and several other company employees. A follow-up report by ANN stated that \\"[f]inancial documents obtained by ANN demonstrate a three- month gap in one employee's payment from March 31 to July 3, followed in September by back pay of only one-third of the $1,800 the employee claims to be owed. The records also indicate other former employees have not received some or all of their claimed back pay.\\" ANN later reported both Brown and Johnson eventually received full back pay as of October 27, though it is unknown if anyone else had received their missing pay. As Ironcat's finances deteriorated and internal politics began to leak to the public, the company gained a reputation as a hotbed of \\"chaos\\", filled with \\"high-school politics\\" amongst staffmembers. At one point the company held a \\"Save Ironcat\\" sale at the 2003 Otakon anime convention. During this time, the company returned to the Studio Ironcat name in October 2003, having settled amicably with Kanzaki over the name and other issues. =Megatokyo and Amerimanga= By mid-2002, the decision was made to get into the growing Amerimanga trend pioneered by competitor Antarctic Press and made notable at the time by TOKYOPOP's Rising Stars of Manga contest and compilation. This was brought about by Ironcat's biggest coup, obtaining the publishing licenses for Megatokyo and Greg Dean's Real Life, two major webcomics. It also began publishing an Amerimanga anthology magazine called, fittingly, AmeriManga. However, the Amerimanga ventures turned out to be disastrous. The first volume of Megatokyo, released in January 2003, was a bonafide hit, with the entire first printing selling out. Ironcat prepared for the release of the second volume when the publishing deal between Ironcat and Fred Gallagher, Megatokyo's creator, fell through. Gallagher would later write on the Megatokyo web site that the parting between him and Ironcat was amicable, though rumors had it that Bennett stated that Gallagher demanded more money for the license. However, many Megatokyo fans noted that Ironcat never shipped out many of their pre-orders for Vol. 1 and also insisted that fans pay in full for pre-orders on Vol. 2 when it had not even gone to press. Gallagher would eventually take Megatokyo to rival publisher Dark Horse Comics. =AmeriManga magazine and author strife= By June of that year, however, AmeriManga magazine had become the focal point of Ironcat's products and a modest hit, boasting a subscription of 600 subscribers. However, at AnimeNEXT, on October 4 of that year, Bennett announced that AmeriManga would go on hiatus, and that it was awaiting responses from the represented artists before proceeding with plans for future issues. However, while Ironcat had expressed an interest in continuing the series, it would have been difficult as Senior Editor Kei Blue had departed the company in July, and fourteen other AmeriManga artists followed suit. Blue told ANN that a clause specifying a timetable for product release and payment was included in the AmeriManga artists' contracts, and that when Ironcat failed to meet the timetable, the contracts were automatically voided. Afterwards, several artists publicly stated that they would not work with Ironcat again. Additionally, Ironcat began to have problems with some of their other artists. The deal with Dean fell through, with Dean opting not to publish Real Life with Ironcat. A more public disagreement occurred when Bennett stated that Ironcat could not contact Japanese artist Saya, creator of Central City, blaming it on an ex-employee who allegedly took the artist's information. In turn, Saya made a public statement, voicing that she was easily able to be contacted via her website, that she had never received any payments from the company and that she would never work with Ironcat again. She also stated that Bennett \\"has no right to say this about his former employee. If they really wish to talk to me, my e-mail address is very easy to find because there were links from their former web page to mine.\\" Attempted comeback In mid-2003, Ironcat received a bailout investment from aspiring author Rachel Ann Prellwitz, who encouraged Bennett to redouble Ironcat's production of books and to expand its offerings to include furry comics. Now a partial owner of Ironcat, Prellwitz began taking an active role in the management of Ironcat, relieving Bennett of some leadership pressures, and at the same time causing a culture clash with some longtime employees and members of the Ironcat \\"family\\". Prellwitz's involvement in Ironcat led to a surge of activity and some optimism about the company's prospects. In late 2003, attorney and animation journalist Brett D. Rogers was brought on board by Bennett as an investor in the company and adviser to management. In late 2004, Ironcat signed artist Isabel Marks, licensing her webcomic Namir Deiter. For the launch, Ironcat created a third imprint, Fuzzy Kitten, as part of a planned imprint for furry-oriented comics. However, only one volume of Namir Deiter was released under this banner. Namir Deiter came too late to help Ironcat. Deep in debt and unable to obtain additional capital, Ironcat was forced to cease printing its current properties and to decline options to license promising manga titles. On January 28, 2005, Studio Ironcat closed operations and made a statement regarding this matter on their website. From that point, the Studio Ironcat website remained open with orders still being taken for present stock, but the site served as a clearing house for the remainder of Ironcat's published stock. On January 12, 2006, a notice was placed on the front page that the catalog was being sent to a liquidator for final dissolution of remaining stock.Ironcat.com (archive), Internet Archive, January 15, 2006 The site is now closed. Steve Bennett litigated matters related to the decline and shutdown of Ironcat in the Virginia Court System in 2006. Cases against Ironcat and Bennett personally were dismissed \\"with prejudice,\\" leaving Bennett free and clear and closing the book on Studio Ironcat.

Gallagher III (born November 15, 1968) is an American illustrator and web cartoonist. He is best known as the artist, co-creator, and now full owner of Megatokyo. He also goes by the name of Piro, the main character of Megatokyo, who he has stated is an idealized version of himself when he was in college. He took this name from that of the cat in the visual novel Kanon. Gallagher lives with his wife and their son in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Projects =The Fine Red Cat= The Fine Red Cat (1993) is a children's book by Jennifer Ann Gallagher, Fred Gallagher's sister. It is notable as the first published work Gallagher illustrated. =Megatokyo= A page of Megatokyo drawn by Gallagher. The webcomic Megatokyo started its run on August 14, 2000 in collaboration with Rodney Caston, who owned the domain and wrote many of the scripts for the first year and a half, while Gallagher was responsible for the artwork. Due to creative differences,http://www.rcaston.com/?q=node/71 Caston agreed to sell his share in the venture to Gallagher in May 2002. Megatokyo's success has allowed Gallagher to pursue it as a full-time occupation since October 2002, after being laid off from his job as an architect. Megatokyo in its entirety is available free of charge at the Megatokyo website, with strips being paired with comments from Gallagher. Gallagher's income from the strip comes from advertising, sales of Megatokyo books and merchandise sold through the Megagear store website which he owns. Since Gallagher attained full control over the strip, it has become more reflective of his vision, with an increasingly complex cast of characters, and a far slower pace than the original strips. The influence of Japanese manga and computer dating sims can be seen in both the character design, plotline and storytelling. While this has earned praise from some critics, it has also alienated some fans of the earlier strips, which were more comical, relying more on humor, slapstick, gags, and simpler storylines. =Fredart= Fredart is a collection of Gallagher's works dating back several years. It includes development sketches from other projects, such as Warmth. Since Megatokyo began, most of the content has been focused on characters from that project. Fredart Studios LLC is the name of the company that officially owns the trademark to Megatokyo and Fred's other works. Megagear Inc. is the company owned and operated by Fred and his wife Sarah that runs the MegaGear store which sells Megatokyo related merchandise. =envelop(e)= A doujinshi work of Gallagher's from 1999. As he describes it: :Using the format of an illustrated story, 'envelop(e)' tells the story of how a misplaced envelope and love letter causes confusion between childhood friends who never really understood how much they meant to each other before. =Warmth= Warmth is a more serious love story on which Gallagher was working before Megatokyo, but it was pushed into the background when Megatokyo became popular. A few chapters of Warmth were released in the early issues of I.C. Entertainment's AmeriManga magazine. Gallagher has stated a number of times that he has not given up on the property, and will continue it in the future. Gallagher had released a sample (but this was later deleted), and many other drawings that include characters who will be featured in Warmth. The main characters of Warmth are called Tom Moore, Tobari Saeko, and Shizuhara Eimi. Both Saeko and Eimi have cameos in recent Megatokyo strips. =Blurred= Blurred was a semi-erotic experimental art website, created by Gallagher in 1998 using the pen name \\"blurri.\\" Gallagher later took it offline for personal reasons, but a discussion on February 2, 2006 on 4chan started a coordinated attempt to discover the contents of this website. On June 8, 2006, Gallagher again allowed public access to the \\"blurred\\" site, and mentioned it in his newspost on Megatokyo, in order to end the controversy. =Title TBA= Fred Gallagher announced that, some time in 2007, megagear (the Megatokyo store) would release a mini doujinshi. Little to nothing was known about this project, but it was expected later in the year. \\"We are looking forward to a great 2007. Megatokyo Volume 5 will be released in the Spring and we have lots of other new items planned including a skateboard deck, the first Megatokyo calendar, clocks, and a mini doujinshi for later in the year. \\" It is possible that this is an endgames doujinshi. \\"But maybe 2 regularly delivered comics with everything else you expect from these websites - rants, updates, etc - including some other projects like maybe 'warmth' getting off the ground (and that endgames doujin i want to do)... we'll see.\\" In 2009, he posted an endgames preview and called it a doujin. In May 2011, it was announced that Endgames were being revamped in a light novel format, with a story written by webfiction author Thomas Knapp, with four light novels planned.MegaTokyo Forums A short story \\"Behind the Masque\\" was also announced, and released on Amazon's Kindle Store on June 10, 2011.via Thomas Knapp's Facebook Achievements One of the most popular artists at United States anime conventions, Fred Gallagher has appeared at Otakon in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005, and also has appeared frequently at A-Kon, Sakura-Con, and Comic-Con International. Anime Central was the first anime convention where he sat for a panel discussion. He is also credited with being the first American manga artist to be a guest at Anime Expo Tokyo. At conventions, Fred Gallagher hosts a panel based on the \\"Naze Nani Megatokyo\\" (\\"The Hows and Whys of Megatokyo\\") omake comic strips, an idea borrowed from an anime series, Martian Successor Nadesico. The panel contained Gallagher (\\"Piro\\") and Rodney Caston (\\"Largo\\") (before Caston left the project due to creative differences), and was also known to contain Dominic Nguyen (\\"Dom\\"). Gallagher has also attended anime conventions outside of the United States. He was Guest of Honour at Ayacon, an anime con located in Northampton, UK, at the start of November 2003. He was slated to appear at the 2006 German convention Connichi in Kassel. However, due to errors in registering his wife's ticket, this was canceled.

Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes. According to Donald Knuth, Melvin Conway coined the term coroutine in 1958 when he applied it to construction of an assembly program. The first published explanation of the coroutine appeared later, in 1963. Comparison with subroutines Subroutines are special cases of coroutines. When subroutines are invoked, execution begins at the start, and once a subroutine exits, it is finished; an instance of a subroutine only returns once, and does not hold state between invocations. By contrast, coroutines can exit by calling other coroutines, which may later return to the point where they were invoked in the original coroutine; from the coroutine's point of view, it is not exiting but calling another coroutine. Thus, a coroutine instance holds state, and varies between invocations; there can be multiple instances of a given coroutine at once. The difference between calling another coroutine by means of \\"yielding\\" to it and simply calling another routine (which then, also, would return to the original point), is that the relationship between two coroutines which yield to each other is not that of caller-callee, but instead symmetric. Any subroutine can be translated to a coroutine which does not call yield. Here is a simple example of how coroutines can be useful. Suppose you have a consumer-producer relationship where one routine creates items and adds them to a queue and another removes items from the queue and uses them. For reasons of efficiency, you want to add and remove several items at once. The code might look like this: var q := new queue coroutine produce loop while q is not full create some new items add the items to q yield to consume coroutine consume loop while q is not empty remove some items from q use the items yield to produce The queue is then completely filled or emptied before yielding control to the other coroutine using the yield command. The further coroutines calls are starting right after the yield, in the outer coroutine loop. Although this example is often used as an introduction to multithreading, two threads are not needed for this: the yield statement can be implemented by a jump directly from one routine into the other. Comparison with threads Coroutines are very similar to threads. However, coroutines are cooperatively multitasked, whereas threads are typically preemptively multitasked. This means that coroutines provide concurrency but not parallelism. The advantages of coroutines over threads are that they may be used in a hard-realtime context (switching between coroutines need not involve any system calls or any blocking calls whatsoever), there is no need for synchronisation primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, etc. in order to guard critical sections, and there is no need for support from the operating system. It is possible to implement coroutines using preemptively- scheduled threads, in a way that will be transparent to the calling code, but some of the advantages (particularly the suitability for hard-realtime operation and relative cheapness of switching between them) will be lost. Comparison with generators Generators, also known as semicoroutines, are a subset of coroutines. Specifically, while both can yield multiple times, suspending their execution and allowing re-entry at multiple entry points, they differ in coroutines' ability to control where execution continues immediately after they yield, while generators cannot, instead transferring control back to the generator's caller.See for example The Python Language Reference \\"https://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr 5.2.10. Yield expressions]\\": \\"All of this makes generator functions quite similar to coroutines; they yield multiple times, they have more than one entry point and their execution can be suspended. The only difference is that a generator function cannot control where should the execution continue after it yields; the control is always transferred to the generator's caller.\\" That is, since generators are primarily used to simplify the writing of iterators, the \`yield\` statement in a generator does not specify a coroutine to jump to, but rather passes a value back to a parent routine. However, it is still possible to implement coroutines on top of a generator facility, with the aid of a top-level dispatcher routine (a trampoline, essentially) that passes control explicitly to child generators identified by tokens passed back from the generators: var q := new queue generator produce loop while q is not full create some new items add the items to q yield consume generator consume loop while q is not empty remove some items from q use the items yield produce subroutine dispatcher var d := new dictionary(generator ‚Üí iterator) d[produce] := start produce d[consume] := start consume var current := produce loop current := next d[current] A number of implementations of coroutines for languages with generator support but no native coroutines (e.g. Python before 2.5) use this or a similar model. Comparison with mutual recursion Using coroutines for state machines or concurrency is similar to using mutual recursion with tail calls, as in both cases the control changes to a different one of a set of routines. However, coroutines are more flexible and generally more efficient. Since coroutines yield rather than return, and then resume execution rather than restarting from the beginning, they are able to hold state, both variables (as in a closure) and execution point, and yields are not limited to being in tail position; mutually recursive subroutines must either use shared variables or pass state as parameters. Further, each mutually recursive call of a subroutine requires a new stack frame (unless tail call elimination is implemented), while passing control between coroutines uses the existing contexts and can be implemented simply by a jump. Common uses Coroutines are useful to implement the following: * State machines within a single subroutine, where the state is determined by the current entry/exit point of the procedure; this can result in more readable code compared to use of goto, and may also be implemented via mutual recursion with tail calls. * Actor model of concurrency, for instance in video games. Each actor has its own procedures (this again logically separates the code), but they voluntarily give up control to central scheduler, which executes them sequentially (this is a form of cooperative multitasking). * Generators, and these are useful for streamsparticularly input/outputand for generic traversal of data structures. * Communicating sequential processes where each sub-process is a coroutine. Channel inputs/outputs and blocking operations yield coroutines and a scheduler unblocks them on completion events. Alternatively, each sub-process may be the parent of the one following it in the data pipeline (or preceding it, in which case the pattern can be expressed as nested generators). * Reverse communication, commonly used in mathematical software, wherein a procedure such as a solver, integral evaluator, ... needs the using process to make a computation, such as evaluating an equation or integrand. Programming languages with native support Coroutines originated as an assembly language method, but are supported in some high-level programming languages. Early examples include Simula, Smalltalk, and Modula-2. More recent examples are Ruby, Lua, Julia, and Go. * Aikido * AngelScript * Ballerina * BCPL * Pascal (Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0 with uThreads module) * BETA * BLISS * C++ (Since C++20) * C# (Since 2.0) * ChucK * CLU * D * Dynamic C * Erlang * F# * Factor * GameMonkey Script * GDScript (Godot's scripting language) * Go * Haskell * High Level Assembly * Icon * Io * JavaScript (since 1.7, standardized in ECMAScript 6) ECMAScript 2017 also includes await support. * Julia * Kotlin (since 1.1) * Limbo * Lua * Lucid * ¬µC++ * MiniD * Modula-2 * Nemerle * Perl 5 (using the Coro module) * PHP (with HipHop, native since PHP 5.5) * Picolisp * Prolog * Python (since 2.5, with improved support since 3.3 and with explicit syntax since 3.5) * Raku * Ruby * Rust (since version 1.39 based on async_std or tokio) * Sather * Scheme * Self * Simula 67 * Smalltalk * Squirrel * Stackless Python * SuperColliderMcCartney, J. \\"Rethinking the Computer Music Programming Language: SuperCollider\\". Computer Music Journal, 26(4):61-68. MIT Press, 2002. * Tcl (since 8.6) * urbiscript Since continuations can be used to implement coroutines, programming languages that support them can also quite easily support coroutines. Implementations , many of the most popular programming languages, including C and its derivatives, do not have direct support for coroutines within the language or their standard libraries. (This is, in large part, due to the limitations of stack-based subroutine implementation.) An exception is the C++ library Boost.Context, part of boost libraries, which supports context swapping on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC and x86 on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows. Coroutines can be built upon Boost.Context. In situations where a coroutine would be the natural implementation of a mechanism, but is not available, the typical response is to use a closurea subroutine with state variables (static variables, often boolean flags) to maintain an internal state between calls, and to transfer control to the correct point. Conditionals within the code result in the execution of different code paths on successive calls, based on the values of the state variables. Another typical response is to implement an explicit state machine in the form of a large and complex switch statement or via a goto statement, particularly a computed goto. Such implementations are considered difficult to understand and maintain, and a motivation for coroutine support. Threads, and to a lesser extent fibers, are an alternative to coroutines in mainstream programming environments today. Threads provide facilities for managing the realtime cooperative interaction of simultaneously executing pieces of code. Threads are widely available in environments that support C (and are supported natively in many other modern languages), are familiar to many programmers, and are usually well-implemented, well- documented and well-supported. However, as they solve a large and difficult problem they include many powerful and complex facilities and have a correspondingly difficult learning curve. As such, when a coroutine is all that is needed, using a thread can be overkill. One important difference between threads and coroutines is that threads are typically preemptively scheduled while coroutines are not. Because threads can be rescheduled at any instant and can execute concurrently, programs using threads must be careful about locking. In contrast, because coroutines can only be rescheduled at specific points in the program and do not execute concurrently, programs using coroutines can often avoid locking entirely. (This property is also cited as a benefit of event-driven or asynchronous programming.) Since fibers are cooperatively scheduled, they provide an ideal base for implementing coroutines above.Implementing Coroutines for .NET by Wrapping the Unmanaged Fiber API , Ajai Shankar, MSDN Magazine However, system support for fibers is often lacking compared to that for threads. =Implementations for C= In order to implement general-purpose coroutines, a second call stack must be obtained, which is a feature not directly supported by the C language. A reliable (albeit platform-specific) way to achieve this is to use a small amount of inline assembly to explicitly manipulate the stack pointer during initial creation of the coroutine. This is the approach recommended by Tom Duff in a discussion on its relative merits vs. the method used by Protothreads. On platforms which provide the POSIX sigaltstack system call, a second call stack can be obtained by calling a springboard function from within a signal handlerhttps://www.gnu.org/software/pth/rse-pmt.ps to achieve the same goal in portable C, at the cost of some extra complexity. C libraries complying to POSIX or the Single Unix Specification (SUSv3) provided such routines as getcontext, setcontext, makecontext and swapcontext, but these functions were declared obsolete in POSIX 1.2008. Once a second call stack has been obtained with one of the methods listed above, the setjmp and longjmp functions in the standard C library can then be used to implement the switches between coroutines. These functions save and restore, respectively, the stack pointer, program counter, callee-saved registers, and any other internal state as required by the ABI, such that returning to a coroutine after having yielded restores all the state that would be restored upon returning from a function call. Minimalist implementations, which do not piggyback off the setjmp and longjmp functions, may achieve the same result via a small block of inline assembly which swaps merely the stack pointer and program counter, and clobbers all other registers. This can be significantly faster, as setjmp and longjmp must conservatively store all registers which may be in use according to the ABI, whereas the clobber method allows the compiler to store (by spilling to the stack) only what it knows is actually in use. Due to the lack of direct language support, many authors have written their own libraries for coroutines which hide the above details. Russ Cox's libtask library \\\\- Russ Cox's libtask coroutine library for FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, and SunOS is a good example of this genre. It uses the context functions if they are provided by the native C library; otherwise it provides its own implementations for ARM, PowerPC, Sparc, and x86. Other notable implementations include libpcl,Portable Coroutine Library - C library using POSIX/SUSv3 facilities coro, \\\\- Edgar Toernig's coro library for x86, Linux & FreeBSD lthread, \\\\- lthread is a multicore/multithread coroutine library written in C libCoroutine, for FreeBSD, Linux, OS X PPC and x86, SunOS, Symbian and others libconcurrency, a simple C library for portable stack-switching coroutines libcoro, used as the basis for the Coro perl module. ribs2, libdill., libaco, and libco. In addition to the general approach above, several attempts have been made to approximate coroutines in C with combinations of subroutines and macros. Simon Tatham's contribution, based on Duff's device, is a notable example of the genre, and is the basis for Protothreads and similar implementations. In addition to Duff's objections, Tatham's own comments provide a frank evaluation of the limitations of this approach: \\"As far as I know, this is the worst piece of C hackery ever seen in serious production code.\\" The main shortcomings of this approximation are that, in not maintaining a separate stack frame for each coroutine, local variables are not preserved across yields from the function, it is not possible to have multiple entries to the function, and control can only be yielded from the top-level routine. =Implementations for C++= * C++ coroutines TS (Technical Specification), a standard for C++ language extensions for a stackless subset of coroutine-like behaviour, is under development. Visual C++ and Clang already support major portions in the std::experimental namespace. coroutines Technical Specification *Boost.Coroutine - created by Oliver Kowalke, is the official released portable coroutine library of boost since version 1.53. The library relies on Boost.Context and supports ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC and X86 on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows. *Boost.Coroutine2 - also created by Oliver Kowalke, is a modernized portable coroutine library since boost version 1.59. It takes advantage of C++11 features, but removes the support for symmetric coroutines. *Mordor - In 2010, Mozy open sourced a C++ library implementing coroutines, with an emphasis on using them to abstract asynchronous I/O into a more familiar sequential model. \\\\- Open Source and Mozy: The Debut of Mozy Code *CO2 - stackless coroutine based on C++ preprocessor tricks, providing await/yield emulation. *ScummVM - The ScummVM project implements a light- weight version of stackless coroutines based on Simon Tatham's article. *tonbit::coroutine - C++11 single .h asymmetric coroutine implementation via ucontext / fiber * Coroutines landed in Clang in May 2017, with libc++ implementation ongoing. \\\\- EricWF: Coroutines are now in Clang Trunk!

Used in the 5-million WebSocket connections experiment by Oat++. Part of the Oat++ web framework. =Implementations for C#= *MindTouch Dream - The MindTouch Dream REST framework provides an implementation of coroutines based on the C# 2.0 iterator pattern *Caliburn - The Caliburn screen patterns framework for WPF uses C# 2.0 iterators to ease UI programming, particularly in asynchronous scenarios. *Power Threading Library - The Power Threading Library by Jeffrey Richter implements an AsyncEnumerator that provides simplified Asynchronous Programming Model using iterator-based coroutines. *The Unity game engine implements coroutines. *Servelat Pieces - The Servelat Pieces project by Yevhen Bobrov provides transparent asynchrony for Silverlight WCF services and ability to asynchronously call any synchronous method. The implementation is based on Caliburn's Coroutines iterator and C# iterator blocks. * - The .NET 2.0+ Framework now provides semi-coroutine (generator) functionality through the iterator pattern and yield keyword. C# 5.0 includes await syntax support. =Implementations for Clojure= Cloroutine is a third-party library providing support for stackless coroutines in Clojure. It's implemented as a macro, statically splitting an arbitrary code block on arbitrary var calls and emitting the coroutine as a stateful function. =Implementations for D= D implements coroutines as its standard library class Fiber A generator makes it trivial to expose a fiber function as an input range, making any fiber compatible with existing range algorithms. =Implementations for Java= There are several implementations for coroutines in Java. Despite the constraints imposed by Java's abstractions, the JVM does not preclude the possibility. There are four general methods used, but two break bytecode portability among standards-compliant JVMs. * Modified JVMs. It is possible to build a patched JVM to support coroutines more natively. The Da Vinci JVM has had patches created. * Modified bytecode. Coroutine functionality is possible by rewriting regular Java bytecode, either on the fly or at compile time. Toolkits include Javaflow, Java Coroutines, and Coroutines. * Platform-specific JNI mechanisms. These use JNI methods implemented in the OS or C libraries to provide the functionality to the JVM. * Thread abstractions. Coroutine libraries which are implemented using threads may be heavyweight, though performance will vary based on the JVM's thread implementation. = Implementations in JavaScript = *node-fibers ** Fibjs - fibjs is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. fibjs uses fibers-switch, sync style, and non-blocking I/O model to build scalable systems. * Since ECMAScript 2015, stackless coroutine functionality through \\"generators\\" and yield expressions is provided. = Implementations for Kotlin = Kotlin implements coroutines as part of a first-party library. = Implementations for Modula-2 = Modula-2 as defined by Wirth implements coroutines as part of the standard SYSTEM library. The procedure NEWPROCESS() fills in a context given a code block and space for a stack as parameters, and the procedure TRANSFER() transfers control to a coroutine given the coroutine's context as its parameter. =Implementation in Mono= The Mono Common Language Runtime has support for continuations, Mono Continuations from which coroutines can be built. =Implementation in the .NET Framework as fibers= During the development of the .NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft extended the design of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) hosting APIs to handle fiber- based scheduling with an eye towards its use in fiber-mode for SQL server., Chris Brumme, cbrumme's WebLog Before release, support for the task switching hook ICLRTask::SwitchOut was removed due to time constraints., Dino Viehland, Dino's Blog Consequently, the use of the fiber API to switch tasks is currently not a viable option in the .NET Framework. =Implementations for Perl= * Coro Coroutines are natively implemented in all Raku backends. =Implementations for PHP= * Amphp =Implementations for Python= *Python 2.5 implements better support for coroutine-like functionality, based on extended generators (PEP 342) *Python 3.3 improves this ability, by supporting delegating to a subgenerator (PEP 380) *Python 3.4 introduces a comprehensive asynchronous I/O framework as standardized in PEP 3156, which includes coroutines that leverage subgenerator delegation *Python 3.5 introduces explicit support for coroutines with async/await syntax (PEP 0492). *Since Python 3.7 async/await became reserved keywords. *Eventlet *Greenlet *gevent *stackless python * Abandoned **Shrapnel (last release 2015) **Kamaelia (last release 2010) **cogen (last release 2009) **multitask (last release 2007) **chiral =Implementations for Ruby= * Ruby 1.9 supports coroutines natively which are implemented as fibers, which are semi-coroutines. * An implementation by Marc De Scheemaecker * Ruby 2.5 and higher supports coroutines natively which are implemented as fibers * An implementation by Thomas W Branson =Implementations for Rust= There is a library for Rust that provides coroutines. Generators are an experimental feature available in nightly rust that provides an implementation of coroutines with async/await. =Implementations for Scala= Scala Coroutines is a coroutine implementation for Scala. This implementation is a library-level extension that relies on the Scala macro system to statically transform sections of the program into coroutine objects. As such, this implementation does not require modifications in the JVM, so it is fully portable between different JVMs and works with alternative Scala backends, such as Scala.js, which compiles to JavaScript.Scala Coroutines FAQ Scala Coroutines rely on the \`coroutine\` macro that transforms a normal block of code into a coroutine definition. Such a coroutine definition can be invoked with the \`call\` operation, which instantiates a coroutine frame. A coroutine frame can be resumed with the \`resume\` method, which resumes the execution of the coroutine's body, until reaching a \`yieldval\` keyword, which suspends the coroutine frame. Scala Coroutines also expose a \`snapshot\` method, which effectively duplicates the coroutine.Scala Coroutine Snapshots A detailed descriptions of Scala coroutines with snapshots appeared at ECOOP 2018, along with their formal model. =Implementations for Scheme= Since Scheme provides full support for continuations, implementing coroutines is nearly trivial, requiring only that a queue of continuations be maintained. =Implementations for Smalltalk= Since, in most Smalltalk environments, the execution stack is a first-class citizen, coroutines can be implemented without additional library or VM support. =Implementations for Swift= *SwiftCoroutine - Swift coroutines library for iOS, macOS and Linux. =Implementation for Tool Command Language (Tcl)= Since version 8.6, the Tool Command Language supports coroutines in the core language. =Implementations for Vala= Vala implements native support for coroutines. They are designed to be used with a Gtk Main Loop, but can be used alone if care is taken to ensure that the end callback will never have to be called before doing, at least, one yield. =Implementations in assembly languages= Machine-dependent assembly languages often provide direct methods for coroutine execution. For example, in MACRO-11, the assembly language of the PDP-11 family of minicomputers, the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù coroutine switch is effected by the instruction \\"JSR PC,@(SP)+\\", which jumps to the address popped from the stack and pushes the current (i.e that of the next) instruction address onto the stack. On VAXen (in Macro-32) the comparable instruction is \\"JSB @(SP)+\\". Even on a Motorola 6809 there is the instruction \\"JSR [,S++]\\"; note the \\"++\\", as 2 bytes (of address) are popped from the stack. This instruction is much used in the (standard) 'monitor' Assist 09.

Dunnett is most famousfor her six novel series set during the 16th century, which concern the fictitious adventurer Francis Crawford of Lymond. This was followed by the eight novel prequel series The House of Niccol√≤. Her other work include a novel concerning the historical Macbeth called King Hereafter (1982), and a series of mystery novels centered upon Johnson Johnson, a portrait painter and spy. Life and work Dunnett was educated at James Gillespie's High School for Girls in Edinburgh. She started her career as a press officer in the civil service, where she met her husband. A leading light in the Scottish arts world and a renaissance woman, she was a professional portrait painter and exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy on many occasions. She had portraits commissioned by a number of prominent public figures in Scotland. She had a keen interest in opera, was a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, a board member of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, a trustee of the Scottish National War Memorial, and a non-executive director of Scottish Television. In 1992 she was awarded an OBE for her services to literature. Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Alexander Fiske-Harrison reviewed her final novel in 2000, Gemini, and through that her entire oeuvre of historical fiction: \\"Although Dunnett‚Äôs writing style is not the neutral prose of genre fiction and it can be opaque and hard to read, especially in the early works, at times, this works with the almost melodramatic content to produce a powerful, operatic mixture... It is neither as a literary novelist nor as a historian, but as a writer of historical fiction that Dorothy Dunnett deserves recognition... The publication of Gemini completes an ambitious literary circle.\\"Fiske-Harrison, Alexander 'Connected By Blood', The Times Literary Supplement. 11 August 2000 In 2001 she founded the Dorothy Dunnett Society to promote interest in the historical periods about which she wrote and communication between her readers. Dorothy Dunnett's archive was left to the National Library of Scotland and articles from it appear in Whispering Gallery, the magazine of the Dorothy Dunnett Society. Dorothy Dunnett was married in 1946 to Sir Alastair Dunnett, editor of The Scotsman newspaper, and appears in his autobiography, Among Friends, 1984. By virtue of his knighthood in 1995, she became Lady Dunnett. She died in Edinburgh, and was survived by her sons Ninian and Mungo Dunnett. Historical fiction =Lymond Chronicles= The manuscript for the first book in the Lymond Chronicles, The Game of Kings, was rejected by five British publishers before being published by US publisher Putnam in 1961. It was written in response to her husband's suggestion that she write something herself, when she complained of having run out of reading material. The Lymond Chronicles is a series of six novels, set in mid-sixteenth-century Europe and the Mediterranean, which follows the life and career of a Scottish nobleman, Francis Crawford of Lymond, from 1547 through 1558. Meticulously researched, the series takes place in a wide variety of locations, including France, the Ottoman Empire, Malta, England, Scotland and Russia. In addition to a compelling cast of original characters, the novels feature many historical figures, often in important roles. =The House of Niccol√≤= The House of Niccol√≤ is a series of eight historical novels set in the late-fifteenth-century European Renaissance. The protagonist of the series is Nicholas de Fleury (Niccol√≤, Nicholas van der Poele, or Claes), a talented boy of uncertain birth who rises to the heights of European merchant banking and international political intrigue. The series shares most of the locations in Dunnett's earlier series, the Lymond Chronicles, but it extends much further geographically to take in the important urban centres of Bruges, Venice, Florence, Geneva, and the Hanseatic League; Burgundy, Flanders, and Poland; Iceland; the Iberian Peninsula and Madeira; the Black Sea cities of Trebizond and Caffa; Persia; the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Rhodes; Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula; and West Africa and the city of Timbuktu. Nicholas's progress is intertwined with such historical characters as Anselm Adornes, James III of Scotland and James II of Cyprus. As with the Lymond Chronicles, the series features a number of historical persons, many as important characters. Both the historical and fictional characters are, however, taken from a wider variety of occupations and social classes than in the Lymond Chronicles. There are significant differences in narrative approach and writing style between the series, reflecting in part the very different personal journey taken by the central character in each. =King Hereafter= King Hereafter (1982), her long novel set in Orkney and Scotland in the years just before the invasion of England by William the Conqueror, was in Dorothy Dunnett's eyes her masterpiece. It is about an Earl of Orkney uniting the people of Alba (Scotland) and becoming its king, and is based on the author's premise that the central character Thorfinn, Earl of Orkney and the historical Macbeth, Scottish King, were one and the same person (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name). =The Dorothy Dunnett Companion and Companion II= Dunnett assisted in the compilation of The Dorothy Dunnett Companion (1994) and The Dorothy Dunnett Companion II (2002), which were written by Elspeth Morrison. These books provide background information to historical characters and events featured in the Lymond Chronicles and The House of Niccol√≤, as well as explanations of classical allusions and literary and other quotations used in the two series, notes to sources of these citations, and many maps. The second volume, which was written after the Niccol√≤ series was completed,contains a bibliography of many of the hundreds of primary and secondary sources Dunnett used in her historical research. Dunnett contributed more to the second volume than the first and wrote many of the entries. The Johnson Johnson series This series of mystery novels was written over a long period, starting when she was writing the Lymond Chronicles. The final entry was published prior to the first House of Niccol√≤ book. Other works =\\"The Proving Climb\\"= A contemporary short story, \\"The Proving Climb\\", set on the Scottish Isle of St. Kilda, was published in the 1973 anthology Scottish Short Stories (Scottish Arts Council, published by Collins, ). It was republished by the Dorothy Dunnett Society and distributed to its members in 2008 with issue 100 of Whispering Gallery. =The Lymond Poetry= The Lymond Poetry, contains her versions and translations of some of the poems that appeared in The Lymond Chronicles. This was finalised after her death by Elspeth Morrison and edited by Richenda Todd ( published in 2003 by Penguin). =The Scottish Highlands= In collaboration with her husband, Alastair Dunnett, she wrote the text for the photography book The Scottish Highlands (Photographs: David Patterson), published in 1988. Adaptations In December 2016, it was announced that the rights to the Lymond Chronicles had been obtained by Mammoth Screen with a view to making a TV series.http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-22/poldark-producers-line-up- new-heroic-historical-drama-the-lymond-chronicles Additional information =Dorothy Dunnett Society= Dorothy Dunnett founded the Dorothy Dunnett Society. Membership of this registered charity is open to all Dunnett readers, and aims to promote interest in the periods of history about which Dunnett wrote, to preserve her writings, and to promote appreciation of the literary merit of her works. It also encourages discussion and meetings between readers. Prior to 1 September 2011, the Society was known as the Dorothy Dunnett Readers' Association. =Memorial= On 22 April 2006, a memorial stone to Lady Dunnett was laid by her grandchildren, Hal and Bella Dunnett, alongside those for Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott in the Makars' Court in Lady Stair's Close on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Lord Provost of Edinburgh was in attendance, and gave a speech, as did the Edinburgh Makar (Valerie Gillies), and the Ross Herald (Charles Burnett). The initiative to lay the stone, and the main funding for it, came from the members of the Dorothy Dunnett Society. The Stone contains Dorothy Dunnett's name, her coat of arms, and a brief quote from one of her books \\"Where are the links of the chain ... joining us to the past\\". =Edinburgh home= Dunnett's long-term home at 87 Colinton Road, Edinburgh was at an Edwardian era semi- detached villa in the Merchiston area, designed by Edward Calvert. =Gatherings= Dorothy Dunnett readers are devoted and active, and have held gatherings in Edinburgh in 1990, 1994, and in 2000 with over 300 people in attendance. Similar events were held in Boston, and in Philadelphia in 2000. Since her death smaller international gatherings of between 50 and 115 people have been held in Dublin (November 2001), New Orleans (November 2003), Malta (October 2005), Saddell in South West Scotland (April 2007), Orkney (September 2007), and Paris (2010). A gathering, 'The Dunnett Siege of Constantinople', took place in Istanbul in September 2012.Whispering Gallery 117 Places visited by the 115 Siegers focused on Pawn in Frankincense and also on John Grant in the Niccol·Ω∏ series, in which historical character John Grant had taken part in the 1453 Siege of Constantinople, this was followed by the 'Dunnett Carnival of Venice' in Venice in 2016 focusing primarily on the 'House of Niccol√≤'.Whispering Gallery 133 There are several meetings of readers in the UK each year, in locations such as Oxford, Bath, London, York, Warwick, Harrogate and Stamford.Whispering Gallery 119 Also the formal Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Dorothy Dunnett Society is held each spring in Edinburgh as part of its Dorothy Dunnett Weekend.Whispering Gallery 119 Occasional meetings are held in Australia and Canada, as well, with one SworDDplay held in Vancouver in April 2006 and another in Alexandria, Virginia in the United States in March 2008 and the Dunnett Confluence of Pittsburgh took place in Pennsylvania in October 2013. Smaller meetings also occur locally in several other countries, such as Germany (notably the annual meeting in Darmstadt) and Italy. Readers also get together more informally to go on holiday to various Dunnett locations. In 2007 some readers visited Timbuktu and others Venice. =International Dorothy Dunnett Day (IDDD)= In 2011, the first International Dorothy Dunnett Day(IDDD01)Hedges, \\"The First Ever International Dorothy Dunnett Day\\", Whispering Gallery, 111. was announced by the Dorothy Dunnett Society to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of The Game of Kings. It was held on Saturday 15 October 2011, with readers gathering in locations around the world at 13:00 (1pm) local time to toast the author. Meetings were held in Edinburgh, London, Vancouver, San Francisco, the Costa Del Sol, Boston, and other locations. The second IDDD (IDDD02)Editor, \\"The First Ever International Dorothy Dunnett Day\\", Whispering Gallery, 115. was held on Saturday 10 November 2012, to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the death of Dorothy Dunnett on 9 November 2001.

Moorehttp://www.geoffreyamoore.com that focuses on the specifics of marketing high tech products during the early start up period. Moore's exploration and expansion of the diffusions of innovations model has had a significant and lasting impact on high tech entrepreneurship. In 2006, Tom Byers, director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, described it as \\"still the bible for entrepreneurial marketing 15 years later\\".Educators Corner: Tom Byers, Stanford Technology Ventures Program - Ten Enduring Success Factors for High Technology Entrepreneurship The book's success has led to a series of follow-up books and a consulting company, The Chasm Group.The Chasm Group  Synopsis  In Crossing the Chasm, Moore begins with the diffusion of innovations theory from Everett Rogers, and argues there is a chasm between the early adopters of the product (the technology enthusiasts and visionaries) and the early majority (the pragmatists). Moore believes visionaries and pragmatists have very different expectations, and he attempts to explore those differences and suggest techniques to successfully cross the \\"chasm,\\" including choosing a target market, understanding the whole product concept, positioning the product, building a marketing strategy, choosing the most appropriate distribution channel and pricing. Crossing the Chasm is closely related to the technology adoption lifecycle where five main segments are recognized: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. According to Moore, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. If a successful firm can create a bandwagon effect in which enough momentum builds, then the product becomes a de facto standard. However, Moore's theories are only applicable for disruptive or discontinuous innovations. Adoption of continuous innovations (that do not force a significant change of behavior by the customer) are still best described by the original technology adoption lifecycle. Pre-chasm Pre-chasm, in technology entrepreneurship, describes the phase prior to Crossing the Chasm that focuses on the specifics of marketing high-tech products during the early start-up period. Pre-chasm was suggested as an extension to Moore's model, arguing that the phase prior to the \\"chasm\\" is left unintended and that it, driven by technology commoditization and lean startup principles, requires an ambidextrous approach to product development alongside marketing to achieve product-market fit.  Sales figures  Moore and his publisher originally thought that the book would sell around 5,000 copies. By 2002, ten years after the first publication, more than 300,000 copies had been sold. Moore attributes this to word-of-mouth marketing, resonating initially with high- tech managers, then to engineers, venture capitalists and finally business schools. The book's success led to a number of sequels including Inside the Tornado, Living on the Fault Line and The Chasm Companion. Crossing the Chasm is available in several prints, one is .

The Mojave River is an intermittent river in the eastern San Bernardino Mountains and the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Most of its flow is underground, while its surface channels remain dry most of the time, with the exception of the headwaters and several bedrock gorges in the lower reaches. History A desert branch of the Serrano Native Americans called the Vanyume or Be√±em√©, as Father Garc√©s called them, lived beyond and along much of the length of the Mojave River, from east of Barstow to at least the Victorville region, and perhaps even farther upstream to the south, for up to 8,000 years. The Mohave's trail, later the European immigrants' Mojave Road, ran west from their villages on the Colorado River to Soda Lake, then paralleled the river from its mouth on the lake to the Cajon Pass. Native Americans used this trade route where water could easily be found en route to the coast. Garc√©s explored the length of the Mojave River in early 1776. He called the river Arroyo de los M√°rtires (\\"river of the martyrs\\") on March 9, 1776 but later Spaniards called it R√≠o de las √Ånimas (\\"spirit river or river of the (lost) souls\\"). In 1826 Jedediah Smith was the first American to travel overland to California by following the Mojave Indian Trail. He called this the Inconstant River. A pack horse and livestock trail, the Old Spanish Trail, established by Antonio Armijo in 1829 between New Mexico and El Pueblo de Los √Ångeles, joined the Mojave River at its mouth near what is now Soda Lake. It followed the river to where the trail reached the foot of the mountains at Summit Valley and turned westward to pass over Cajon Pass and descend into the coastal valleys of southern Alta California. In 1830, Wolfskill and Yount pioneered what became the Main Route of the Old Spanish Trail, which followed a different route than Armijo, farther south just west of the Colorado River and then followed Jedediah Smith's path on the old Mohave Trail west to the Mojave River mouth at Soda Lake, to meet with Armijo's route coming south from Salt Spring. Sometime before 1844, a cutoff developed on the Old Spanish Trail that cut the distance traveled along the upper river, by cutting across what is now Victor Valley, from the Cajon Pass to a crossing just below the Lower Narrows of the river. John C. Fr√©mont intercepted this route to the river, riding east southeast from Lake Elizabeth, north of the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains on April 20, 1844. Fr√©mont named the river Mohahve after the Mohave people on April 23, 1844, although these people lived two mountain ranges away on the Colorado River. He had met six travelling Mohaves that day. Some early Mormon ranchers called it the Macaby River. Additionally another cutoff to the Old Spanish Trail had developed before 1844, where the trail forked northeastward from the Mojave River and Mohave Trail, east of what is now Yermo, California running over Alvord Mountain, to Bitter Spring, then through Red Pass, to join the Armijo route near Salt Spring in the Silurian Valley. The fork of the trails there on the Mojave River, later became known as Fork of the Road. From 1847, Mormons pioneered the wagon road that became the Mormon Road from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles closely following the route of the Old Spanish Trail from Parowan, Utah. They followed the Mojave River from the Fork of the Road to the Lower Narrows, and left the river for the Cajon Pass on the route Fr√©mont had found. In 1849, Forty-niners late on the main trail to California used the Mormon Road as a winter alternative route to California, referring to it as the \\"Southern Route\\" of the California Trail. Later emigrants to California followed the same route during the winter months. In 1855, the Mormon Road was improved and the route changed in places, becoming a major commercial wagon route between Utah and southern California, ending Utah's winter isolation until the railroads arrived there in 1869. In 1859, as part of the Mohave War, the Mohave people's trail was improved as the wagon route of the Mojave Road. It followed the Mojave River from where the Mormon Road turned north away from the river at Fork of the Road, near Daggett, to where historic Camp Cady was located. It then followed the river to Soda Lake, where the road turned eastward to Fort Mojave, and in 1862 following the gold and silver strikes on the Colorado River, to Hardyville and the mining districts near it, and its connection at the head of the toll road to Prescott and the mines in the interior of Arizona Territory. From 1863 to 1864, the Mojave River valley was a refuge from the great drought in California in those years; cattle of some resourceful ranchers of southern California were preserved by its resources. Course Victorville (bottom) to Johnstons Corner near Barstow (top) The river's source is in the San Bernardino Mountains, one of the Transverse Ranges, above Hesperia-San Bernardino. The West Fork of the Mojave flows into Silverwood Lake, formed by Cedar Springs Dam, which overflows in the Mojave River Forks Reserve area. On occasion, the lake releases water into the river. Downstream, Deep Creek meets the West Fork, forming the Mojave River immediately upstream of the Mojave Forks Dam, which provides flood control. Downstream of the dam, the Mojave River flows north and east, underground in most places, through Hesperia, Victorville, and Barstow. Near its terminus, the Mojave River flows out onto a large inland delta called the Mojave River Wash at the western edge of Mojave National Preserve. During heavy flows, the river reaches Soda Lake near Baker at the north end of the Wash, and has reached Silver Lake, even further north, in historic times. For example, during the unusually wet winter of 2004‚Äì2005, the Mojave River flowed on the surface all the way to Silver Lake and filled both Soda and Silver Lakes to a depth of several feet. Mojave River Dam Outlet The water in the river is mostly underground. The channel at the surface remains dry most of the time, but extreme flooding is possible. For example, during a heavy El Ni√±o in the Mojave Desert, rains caused the Mojave River to overflow onto overpassing bridges on February 22, 1993, the most damaged being on Bear Valley Road, where Victorville and Apple Valley are separated. The water comes to the surface only in areas with impermeable rock, such as the upper and lower narrows near Victorville and in the Afton Canyon area northeast of Barstow. Afton Canyon Natural Area Union Pacific 844 pulls a steam excursion train crossing Afton Canyon, 2011. The Afton Canyon Natural Area is within Mojave Trails National Monument, and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.The Wildlands Conservancy: Mojave Trails National Monument, \\"The National Treasures at the Heart of the Mojave\\". It is located 37 miles northeast of Barstow along Interstate 15 between the Afton Road and Basin Road exits. Afton Canyon is designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern to protect plant and wildlife habitat, and to preserve scenic values of the Mojave River's riparian area within the canyon. The Rasor Off-Highway Vehicle Area boundary enforcement has begun to reverse the heavy off-road vehicles use and damage that occurred in the riverbed and canyon. Restoration projects are ongoing, and have already brought the river's \\"proper functioning condition\\" from a \\"non-functioning\\" to a \\"functioning at risk\\" status. The objectives of the ambitious restoration project are to control exotic plants, particularly the phreatophyte Saltcedar - Tamarix (primarily Tamarix ramosissima and Tamarix parviflora), and restoring critical desert California native plant community \\"structural elements\\" for a functioning flora and fauna habitat.

Lambeth Palace Library, London. Arms of Woodville: Argent, a fesse and a canton conjoined gules Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers (c. 144025 June 1483), was an English nobleman, courtier, bibliophile and writer. He was the brother of Queen Elizabeth Woodville who married King Edward IV. He was one of the leading members of the Woodville family, which came to prominence during the reign of King Edward IV. After Edward's death, he was arrested and then executed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future King Richard III) as part of a power-struggle between Richard and the Woodvilles. His English translation of The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers is one of the first books printed in England. This presents a detailed biography.  Origins  He was the eldest son to survive childhood of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers by his wife Jacquetta of Luxembourg. His sister was Elizabeth Woodville who married King Edward IV and became queen.  Career  Like his father, he was originally a Lancastrian, fighting on that side at the Battle of Towton, but later became a Yorkist. The Woodvilles became very influential at the royal court after his sister Elizabeth Woodville married Edward IV and became queen. Anthony was made a Knight of the Garter. He is known to have been a great tournament champion, and once fought a two-day \\"duel\\" with Antoine, bastard of Burgundy. The Yorkists, fighting for Edward IV, were defeated at the Battle of Edgecote Moor, on 26 July 1469, and Richard Woodville and his second son John Woodville were taken prisoners at Chepstow. After a hasty and controversial trial, they were both beheaded at Kenilworth on 12 August 1469 and Anthony succeeded his father in the earldom. = Career as Earl Rivers = He joined the king in his temporary exile in 1470, and returned with him the next year, where he was wounded at the Battle of Barnet. As a result of this battle, Edward IV regained the throne. In 1472, Edward IV sent Rivers and his younger brother Edward Woodville to Brittany at the head of 1000 archers to help the Bretons fend off a threatened French invasion of the duchy. The French withdrew when faced with determined resistance.Ross, Charles, Edward IV, University of California Press, 1974, p.206 Also in 1473, King Edward IV appointed Rivers Governor of the Prince of Wales' household, and Rivers went with the prince to Ludlow Castle. He was also appointed High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for life. His duties included the administration of justice throughout the principality.  Death and succession  When the king died suddenly in 1483, Rivers was ordered by his sister to bring the Prince of Wales, now King Edward V, straight back to London under an armed guard. They were intercepted by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), who arrested the Earl, along with his nephew Sir Richard Grey, the young king's half- brother.Chalmers' Biography, vol. 32, p 351 Rivers was imprisoned and then beheaded at Pontefract Castle on 25 June 1483 as part of the duke's path towards kingship (as Richard III). Anthony was succeeded by his brother Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers. The Scales lands inherited from his wife were bequeathed to his younger brother Edward Woodville, but King Richard III ignored Anthony's wishes as Edward had joined Henry Tudor.  Marriages  He married twice, without legitimate progeny, as follows: *Firstly to Elizabeth de Scales, suo jure Baroness Scales (d. 1473), daughter and heiress of Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales, and widow of Henry Bourchier, younger son of Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex. Before succeeding to his father's earldom, Anthony was summoned to Parliament, in right of his wife, as Baron Scales. *Secondly he married Mary FitzLewis, daughter of Henry FitzLewis. = Mistresses and illegitimate progeny = Shield forming ceiling boss of the Poyntz Chapel within the Gaunt's Chapel in Bristol, showing the arms of Poyntz (of 4 quarters) impaling the arms of Woodville (of 6 quarters, 3rd quarter Woodville) Remnants of chest-tomb of Sir Robert Poyntz (d. 1520) in the Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol, showing heraldry of Poyntz and Woodville.

The stone ceiling boss of the Poyntz Chapel displays in relief sculpture the arms of Poyntz (of 4 quarters) impaling the arms of Woodville (of 6 quarters, 3rd quarter Woodville), and the two wooden end- panels of his monumental coffin, decorated with the heraldry of Poyntz and Woodville, survive in the Gaunt's Chapel in which he was buried.

Literary interests  Rivers was evidently quite learned, and no doubt had learned excellent French from his mother. He had met the earliest English printer William Caxton when in exile in Bruges, and there in 1475‚Äì76 Caxton published Cordyale, or Four last thinges, Rivers' English translation from the French of Jean Mi√©lot of Les quattres choses derrenieres, itself a translation of the Cordiale quattuor novissimorum. After both of them had returned to England, one of the first, if not the first, books printed in England was Rivers' translation from French of the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers, printed by Caxton at Westminster in 1477.Caxton exhibition Lambeth Palace Library has a manuscript illustration showing Rivers presenting a copy of this book to Edward IV.

M. Hare, was an English moral philosopher who held the post of White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford from 1966 until 1983. He subsequently taught for a number of years at the University of Florida. His meta-ethical theories were influential during the second half of the twentieth century. Hare is best known for his development of prescriptivism as a meta-ethical theory, the analysis of formal features of moral discourse justifying preference utilitarianism. Some of Hare's students, such as Brian McGuinness, John Lucas, and Bernard Williams went on to become well-known philosophers. Peter Singer, known for his involvement with the animal liberation movement (who studied Hare's work as an honours student at the University of Melbourne and came to know Hare personally whilst he was an Oxford BPhil graduate student), has explicitly adopted some elements of Hare's thought, though not his doctrine of universal prescriptivism. Life and career Richard Hare was born in Backwell, Somerset. He attended Rugby School in Warwickshire, followed in 1937 by Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Greats (Classics). Although he was a pacifist, he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery. Hare was taken as a prisoner of war by the Japanese from the fall of Singapore in 1942 to the end of the Second World War. Hare's wartime experience had a lasting impact on his philosophical views, particularly his view that moral philosophy has an obligation to help people live their lives as moral beings (King 2004). His earliest work in philosophy, which has never been published, dates from this period, and in it, he tried to develop a system that might \\"serve as a guide to life in the harshest conditions\\", according to The Independent. He returned to Oxford after the war, and in 1947, married Catherine Verney, a marriage that produced a son and three daughters. (Hare's son, John E. Hare, is also a philosopher.) He was elected fellow and tutor in philosophy at Balliol from 1947 to 1996; honorary fellow at Balliol from 1974 to 2002; and was appointed Wilde Lecturer in Natural Religion, 1963‚Äì66; and White's Professor of Moral Philosophy, 1966‚Äì1983, which accompanied a move to Corpus Christi. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1972 to 1973. He left Oxford in 1983 to become Graduate Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of Florida at Gainesville, a post he held until 1994. After suffering a series of strokes, R. M. Hare died in Ewelme, Oxfordshire, on 29 January 2002 At his memorial service held at St Mary's Church, Oxford, in May of that year, Peter Singer delivered (as he felt Hare would have wished) a lecture on Hare's \\"Achievements in Moral Philosophy\\" which concluded by giving three \\"major, lasting\\" ones, namely, \\"restoring reason to moral argument, distinguishing intuitive and critical levels of moral thinking, and pioneering the development of ... applied ethics\\". Influences Hare was greatly influenced by the emotivism of A. J. Ayer and Charles L. Stevenson, the ordinary language philosophy of J. L. Austin, a certain reading of the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, utilitarianism, and Immanuel Kant. Hare held that ethical rules should not be based on a principle of utility, though he took into account utilitarian considerations. His hybrid approach to meta-ethics distinguishes him from classical utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham. His book Sorting Out Ethics might be interpreted as saying that Hare is as much a Kantian as he is a utilitarian, but other sources\\"What Kant Might Say to Hare\\" disagree with this assessment. Although Hare used many concepts from Kant, especially the idea of universalisability, he was still a consequentialist, rather than a deontologist, in his normative ethical views. Hare himself addressed the possibility that Kant was a utilitarian like himself, in his \\"Could Kant Have Been a Utilitarian?\\" Universal prescriptivism In a series of books, especially The Language of Morals (1952), Freedom and Reason (1963), and Moral Thinking (1981), Hare gave shape to a theory that he called universal prescriptivism. According to this, moral terms such as 'good', 'ought' and 'right' have two logical or semantic properties: universalizability and prescriptivity. By the former, he meant that moral judgments must identify the situation they describe according to a finite set of universal terms, excluding proper names, but not definite descriptions. By the latter, he meant that moral agents must perform those acts they consider themselves to have an obligation to perform whenever they are physically and psychologically able to do so. In other words, he argued that it made no sense for someone to say, sincerely: \\"I ought to do X\\", and then fail to do X. This was identified by Frankena, Nobis and others as a major flaw in Hare's system, as it appeared to take no account of akrasia, or weakness of the will. Hare argued that the combination of universalizability and prescriptivity leads to a certain form of consequentialism, namely, preference utilitarianism. In brief, this means that we should act in such a way as to maximise the satisfaction of people's preferences. Importance of specificity Hare departs from Kant's view that only the most general maxims of conduct be used (for example, \\"do not steal\\"), but the consequences ignored, when applying the categorical imperative. To ignore consequences leads to absurdity: for example, that it would be wrong to steal a terrorist's plans to blow up a nuclear facility. All the specific facts of a circumstance must be considered, and these include probable consequences. They also include the relevant, universal properties of the facts: for example, the psychological states of those involved. Applied ethics and political philosophy While Hare was primarily interested in meta-ethics, he also made some important contributions to the fields of political philosophy and applied ethics. Among his essays within these fields those on the wrongness of slavery, abortion and the Golden Rule, and on demi-vegetarianism have received the most attention. Hare's most important work in political philosophy and applied ethics is collected in the two volumes Essays on Political Morality (1989) and Essays on Bioethics (1993), both published by Oxford University Press.

The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock, and until around 1800 was used to refer to a variety of waders. The English name was first recorded in about 1050. According to the Harleian Miscellany, a group of them is called a \\"fall.\\"  Taxonomy  Only two woodcocks are widespread, the others being localized island endemics. Most are found in the Northern Hemisphere but a few range into the Greater Sundas, Wallacea and New Guinea. Their closest relatives are the typical snipes of the genus Gallinago. As with many other sandpiper genera, the lineages that led to Gallinago and Scolopax likely diverged around the Eocene, some 55.8-33.9 million years ago, although the genus Scolopax is only known from the late Pliocene onwards. Woodcock species are known to undergo rapid speciation in island chains, with the extant examples being the Amami woodcock in the Ryukyu Islands and the several species of woodcock in the Indonesian islands, the Philippines, and New Guinea. Subfossil evidence indicates the presence of another radiation of woodcock species in the Greater Antilles; these Caribbean woodcocks may have been more closely related to the Old World woodcock species than the New World ones, and were likely wiped out by human incursion into the region. Description and ecology American woodcock Woodcocks have stocky bodies, cryptic brown and blackish plumage and long slender bills. Their eyes are located on the sides of their heads, which gives them 360¬∞ vision.woodcock (bird) ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-10. Unlike in most birds, the tip of the bill's upper mandible is flexible. As their common name implies, the woodcocks are woodland birds. They feed at night or in the evenings, searching for invertebrates in soft ground with their long bills. This habit and their unobtrusive plumage makes it difficult to see them when they are resting in the day. Most have distinctive displays known as \\"roding\\", usually given at dawn or dusk. The range of breeding habits of the Eurasian woodcock extends from the west of Ireland eastwards across Europe and Asia preferring mostly boreal forest regions engulfing northern Japan, and also from the northern limits of the tree zone in Norway. Continuing south to the Pyrenees and the northern limits of Spain. Nests have been found in Corsica and there are three isolated Atlantic breeding stations in Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. In Asia the sites can be seen as far south as Kashmir and the Himalayas. Hunting Some woodcocks being popular gamebirds, the island endemic species are often quite rare due to overhunting. The pin feathers (coverts of the leading primary feather of the wing) of the Eurasian woodcock are sometimes used as brushtips by artists, who use them for fine painting work. The dog breed cocker spaniel is named after the bird, and were originally bred to hunt the woodcock. Species The following species of woodcocks are extant today: * Eurasian woodcock, Scolopax rusticola (large Eurasian range) * Amami woodcock, Scolopax mira (endemic to the Amami Islands in Japan) * Javan woodcock, Scolopax saturata (endemic to Sumatra and Java in Indonesia) * New Guinea woodcock, Scolopax rosenbergii (endemic to New Guinea) * Bukidnon woodcock, Scolopax bukidnonensis (endemic to Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines) * Sulawesi woodcock, Scolopax celebensis (endemic to Sulawesi in Indonesia) * Moluccan woodcock, Scolopax rochussenii (endemic to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia) * American woodcock, Scolopax minor (large North American range) =Fossil record= A number of woodcocks are extinct and are known only from fossil or subfossil bones. * \\"Scolopax baranensis\\" (fossil, Early Pliocene of Hungary; a nomen nudum) * Scolopax carmesinae (fossil, Early/Middle Pliocene? of Menorca, Mediterranean) * Scolopax hutchensi (fossil, Late Pliocene ‚Äì Early Pleistocene of Florida, USA) * Scolopax anthonyi (prehistoric)Species of woodcock * Scolopax brachycarpa (subfossil, Holocene of Haiti) References External links *Arthur Cleveland Bent.

He and his gang specialised in robbing jewellery stores with assault rifles. Their weapon of choice was the AK-47 assault rifle, which they acquired from black markets hosted by triads. He is also the first person to have used an AK-47 during an armed-robbery in Hong Kong. Early crimes In October 1984, when he was 23, Yip led a gang of five armed mainland men into Hong Kong. They robbed two jewelry stores, King Fook Jewellery Co. Ltd on and Dickson Jewellery Co. Ltd. on ; they managed to obtain more than million worth of precious items as a result. In the course of both robberies, shots were fired. An undercover policeman posed as a potential buyer for the stolen goods as part of a sting operation. During the subsequent meeting, once the policeman identified himself, Yip attempted to shoot him and a violent struggle occurred. After Yip was subdued, he was found with two handguns, later linked by ballistics to the October robberies. Yip was convicted on four counts (two counts of handling stolen goods for each robbery, possession of firearms, and use of a firearm with intent to resist arrest) and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Yip contested the conviction, claiming that he was asked only to find a buyer for what he thought were sub-standard watches produced in local factories; his appeal was dismissed in 1987. But he escaped on , when he faked appendicitis and was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital. In the toilet, he jumped his two officers with broken bottles and made off in a van parked at the hospital entrance. He hijacked the van with two occupants inside, a 37-year-old van driver and driver's 6-year-old son. While driving, he forced the driver to take off shoes and clothes so Yip could put them on. He got off at Wong Chuk Hang and left the scene by bus. He is presumed to have fled into mainland China. On the run =AK-47 heists= On , he and his gang, armed with AK-47s and pistols, robbed five goldsmiths shops on the \\"Golden\\" Mut Wah Street in Kwun Tong. They fired 54 shots at police and escaped with gold and jewelry worth million. Many onlookers believed the gun battle was being staged for a film. The gang was linked to a robbery of two jewelers on Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po on . During the course of that robbery, gang members fired 65 shots at police and members of the public, escaping with million worth of jewelry. Yip is thought to have been involved in a jewelry store robbery on Nathan Road in Mong Kok, when a gang fired 30 rounds from AK-47s, killing a woman passerby. One robber was shot by police during the chase; the others dumped his body on the street when they switched getaway cars. Macau police suspected Yip was involved in an April 1994 armed heist of million in gambling chips from the casino at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Taipa. In 1995, Yip moved his crime operation to Shenzhen, participating in the January abduction and murder of a Tianjin businessman and the November murder of a police informant. The total worth of his stolen goods is estimated at million (Approximately $2,576,920 US). Yip achieved notoriety by escaping police custody multiple times. =Capture and trial= His career finally came to an end on when he was arrested following a Kennedy Town gunfight with police that left him paralyzed from the waist down. At the time he had a million reward on his head, but the two officers involved did not receive the reward. Two police officers had surprised Yip and his gang in an alley near the waterfront. Since they had just debarked from a boat, the police suspected they were illegal immigrants and asked for identification. The rest of the gang fled, but Yip pulled a gun from a bag and began shooting. During an ensuing foot pursuit, the officers testified they ordered him to drop his gun, which he refused to do, instead shooting at the officers. After his gun jammed, he was captured. He was found with a machine gun, a pistol, and 1.8 kg of explosives. He was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence and shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm stemming from wounds one of the officers received in the course of the arrest. While Yip was recovering from his injuries, additional charges of escaping custody and kidnapping (during the van hijack) were added stemming from his 1989 escape. During the lead-up to the trial, a fictionalized version of Yip's life was filmed as The King of Robbery (), also known as Life Will Never Be Twice, starring Simon Yam and Roy Cheung), but its planned August 1996 release was delayed by court order. Yip's trial began on , with the defence claiming the police shot Yip in the back and then stole from him. He dismissed his defence team two days later, apparently falling asleep when given the chance to cross- examine a prosecution witness. On , he was convicted of all charges and sentenced to 41 years in prison, which consists of the 11 years he had left on his original sentence and 30 years on the new charges, to be served consecutively. The earliest year in which he could have been released was 2022. Imprisonment Yip's lawyers appealed his conviction, stating the publicity surrounding his arrest was prejudicial to the jury, but lost the appeal on . A separate appeal to reduce his sentence, based on his injuries and subsequent care, was heard in March 1999. The Court of Appeal reduced his sentence by approximately five years. Yip subsequently went to the Court of Final Appeal seeking a reduction in his sentence based on his 'catastrophic' medical condition, but the appeal was denied. He was married to his mainland wife in August 2003. He had been previously married (to the same woman) under a false name before his imprisonment. Yip continued to maintain his innocence over the 1996 shootout, offering a substantial reward for a witness he alleges saw the events leading up to his arrest. Yip converted to Christianity in March 2004. Yip was sentenced on to an additional six months in jail for assaulting an officer at Stanley Prison on . He had complained that he had been badly treated by prison guards. On 1 April 2017, he was hospitalised at Queen Mary Hospital for cancer treatment. He died on 19 April 2017 of lung cancer.

The English name is imitative of the Eurasian curlew's call, but may have been influenced by the Old French corliu, \\"messenger\\", from courir , \\"to run\\". It was first recorded in 1377 in Langland's Piers Plowman \\"Fissch to lyue in √æe flode..√ûe corlue by kynde of √æe eyre\\". In Europe \\"curlew\\" usually refers to one species, the Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata. They are one of the most ancient lineages of scolopacid waders, together with the godwits which look similar but have straight bills. Curlews feed on mud or very soft ground, searching for worms and other invertebrates with their long bills. They will also take crabs and similar items. Curlews enjoy a worldwide distribution. Most species show strong migratory habits and consequently one or more species can be encountered at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia. The distribution of curlews has altered considerably in the past hundred years as a result of changing agricultural practices. Reclamation and drainage of marshy fields and moorland, and afforestation of the latter, have led to local decreases, while conversion of forest to grassland in some parts of Scandinavia has led to increases there.Encyclopedia of the Animal World (1977): Vol.6: 518‚Äì519. Bay Books, Sydney. There are now only a small number of curlews in Ireland and Britain raising concerns that the bird will go extinct in those countries. The stone-curlews are not true curlews (family Scolopacidae) but members of the family Burhinidae, which is in the same order Charadriiformes, but only distantly related within that. Taxonomy The genus Numenius was erected by the French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Ornithologie published in 1760. The type species is the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus Numenius in the 6th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the curlews together with the woodcocks in the genus Scolopax. As the publication date of Linnaeus's sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson and not Linnaeus is considered as the authority for the genus. The name Numenius is from Ancient Greek noumenios, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from neos, \\"new\\" and mene \\"moon\\", referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The genus contains nine species: *Eurasian whimbrel Numenius phaeopus *Hudsonian whimbrel Numenius hudsonicus *Slender-billed curlew Numenius tenuirostris ‚Äì critically endangered, possibly extinct (early 21st century?) *Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata *Long-billed curlew Numenius americanus *Far Eastern curlew Numenius madagascariensis *Little curlew Numenius minutus *Eskimo curlew Numenius borealis ‚Äì critically endangered, possibly extinct (early 1960s?) *Bristle- thighed curlew Numenius tahitiensis The Late Eocene (Montmartre Formation, some 35 mya) fossil Limosa gypsorum of France was originally placed in Numenius and may in fact belong there.Olson, Storrs L. (1985): Section X.D.2.b. Scolopacidae. In: Farner, D.S.; King, J.R. & Parkes, Kenneth C. (eds.): Avian Biology 8: 174‚Äì175. Academic Press, New York. Apart from that, a Late Pleistocene curlew from San Josecito Cave, Mexico has been described. This fossil was initially placed in a distinct genus, Palnumenius, but was actually a chronospecies or paleosubspecies related to the long-billed curlew. The upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) is an odd bird which is the closest relative of the curlews. It is distinguished from them by its yellow legs, long tail, and shorter, less curved bill.
