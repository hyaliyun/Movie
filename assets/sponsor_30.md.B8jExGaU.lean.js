The name Swiftfox comes from the animal swift fox. Swiftfox differs from Firefox by a limited number of changes, and builds for different processors. Swiftfox was discontinued at some point prior to April 2017, and the project homepage now redirects to the creator's private Twitter account.  Optimization  The Swiftfox build is optimized using the following methods: Binary code optimization *Compiled with the highest level of compiler optimization, rather than optimization for binary size. ** Swiftfox is compiled -O3,Using url of about:buildconfig to check the details of the 2.0 builds (the highest level) ***The resulting Swiftfox binary is larger than Firefox. (-O3 is not necessarily faster than -O2, or -Os. -O3 introduces two more options on top of -O2: -finline-functions and -frename-registers. The latter is good for CPUs with many registers but may actually be slower on other CPUs.) **Firefox is compiled -Os. (-Os is the same as -O2 but removes optimizations which would increase the binary size.) *Binaries incorporate additional instruction sets. ** Intel and AMD: MMX, SSE, SSE2, (not generally SSE3). ** AMD only: 3DNow! *Optimization specific to the build microprocessor architecture. ** Intel: Pentium 4, Pentium 3, Pentium M, Pentium III, Pentium II, Pentium 4 (Prescott). ** AMD64: Athlon64 (32bit binary). ** AMD: Athlon XP, Athlon, K6-2. *Compiled with newer version of GCC (Firefox 2.0 uses 3.3.2, Swiftfox 2.0 uses 4.0.4).

Size: 5.4 x 4.6 x 1.9 cm. Bush fire in Usakos, 2009 Usakos (Damara: grab the heel, Otjiherero name: Okanduu) is a town on the banks of river Khan, 140 kilometres north-east of Swakopmund in the Erongo Region of Namibia. It is located on the B2 (Trans-Kalahari Highway), the main road between the Walvis Bay and Johannesburg. The town has 3,000 inhabitants and owns of land. Surrounded by mountains, Usakos is quite picturesque. Certain spots around the town show the longest uninterrupted horizon in the world. It is the closest town to the Spitzkoppe, often referred to as the \\"Matterhorn of Namibia\\". History The settlement was founded in the early 1900s as a workshop and watering station for locomotives. Herero chief Samuel Maharero sold the land to Europeans who resold it in 1903 to the Otavi Minen- und Eisenbahngesellschaft (Otavi Mining and Railway Company) (OMEG) which operated an industrial railway line from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. OMEG established a railway station and a repair shop which was used until the 1960s. When mining operations slowed down, Usakos' importance faded quickly. Today it is just a drive-through from the Namibian inland to the coast. Historic buildings and structures in Usakos are the Roman Catholic church (erected 1905), the now dilapidated railway station building, and the old hotel.  Development and infrastructure  Usakos is riddled with poverty and alcohol abuse, the unemployment rate is around 60%. Unlike other Namibian towns, it has not seen substantial development since independence in 1990. Usakos Railway Station connects the town to the Namibian railway network. Politics Usakos was downgraded from municipal to town status in 2010. It is governed by a town council that has seven seats. In the 2010 local authority election, a total of 1,029 votes were cast in the city. SWAPO won with approximately 47% of the vote. Of the three other parties seeking votes in the election, United Democratic Front (UDF) received approximately 31% of the vote, followed by RDP (17%) and COD (4%).Local Authority Election Results for Usakos SWAPO also won the 2015 local authority elections, gaining four seats (513 votes). Two seats went to the UDF (295 votes), and the remaining one to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 76 votes). Notable residents Usakos is the hometown of the following prominent politicians: * Michael Goreseb, member of the National Assembly of Namibia * Theo-Ben Gurirab Speaker of the National Assembly * Tsudao Gurirab, Member of Parliament from 1999 to 2009 * Alpheus «ÉNaruseb, Minister of Land and Resettlement  See also  * Usakos Reformed Church (NGK)  References  Towns in Namibia Populated places in the Erongo Region Populated places established in the 1900s ","title":"Usakos"},{"id":"5746158","text":"Shek Pai Wan or Aberdeen Bay is a bay between Aberdeen on Hong Kong Island and Ap Lei Chau (formerly Aberdeen Island).

Career Prior to forming Levitation, Francolini played with several bands in Bristol in the late 1980s. He replaced the drummer in Something Pretty Beautiful, a band formed by Julian Cope's brother Joss, just before a nationwide tour with The House of Love, where he first met guitarist Terry Bickers. Francolini and Bickers co-founded the psychedelic rock band Levitation in 1990. During this period, Francolini also co-founded the band Strangelove with Patrick Duff in 1991. Francolini only played two gigs with the band before being replaced by Jon Langley. Levitation went on to release several singles and one album. The band continued until 1994 (despite the departure of Terry Bickers in 1993), and Francolini remained with the band until the final split. He reunited with former Levitation bandmates Christian Hayes and Laurence O'Keefe in 1996 to form Dark Star. The band released one album, Twenty Twenty Sound in 1999 before splitting in 2001. Following the demise of Dark Star, Francolini returned to Bristol and set up recording studio Ohm Studios, where he began working on the debut album with his new band Dragons, as well as the \\"City Of The Dead\\" project. Initially a studio project with singer Anthony Tombling Jr (whom Francolini has previously worked with when producing Transambient Communications and Timo Maas), news of Francolini's new band was reported in 2003 but the band didn't surface until 2007. Early shows featured both Hayes and O'Keefe as part of the live band, with the band disbanding in 2009. A second album was recorded, but was left unmixed. In 2005, Francolini produced and played on the 2005 Julian Cope albums Rite Bastard and Citizen Cain'd under the pseudonym Mitch Razor.

Vineyard of Peace) is a kibbutz in southern Israel. Located on the Gaza Strip-Israel-Egypt border, it falls under the jurisdiction of Eshkol Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The kibbutz was founded in 1967 adjacent to the triborder area by members of Hashomer Hatzair. Its name includes the word shalom since the members believed that the location would play a role in establishing peace and ending the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Haaretz described it as \\"a small community with a communal-secular way of life, which marks holidays and holds culture evenings together and observes total mutual responsibility - in education, culture, health and its economy.\\" According to Ilan Regev, the community manager, \\"the kibbutz, which was founded in 1967, fell apart in 1995, after members left, but in 2001, it was reestablished.\\" In 2011, the kibbutz had 35 members and candidates (families and individuals), about 30 children and eight members of a youth movement on a year of service prior to serving in the IDF. Eight families joined the kibbutz after Operation Cast Lead. The kibbutz started a campaign in 2011 to attract new residents, called \\"Zionism 2011\\". Proximity to the Gaza Strip, being subjected to Palestinian mortar attacks and its association with the abduction of Gilad Shalit, which happened close by, has resulted in the kibbutz struggling to increase its membership according to Regev. He described the kibbutz as \\"unique in the country in an area that in effect determines the borders of the state, the way it was at the start of Zionism, with an attempt to shape a just and egalitarian society.\\" The Israeli government required the kibbutz to populate at least 40% of the 100 allocated residential slots within a specified time which, according to Regev, required 80 new members and candidates. The state can reduce the \\"means of production‚Äîland, water and the like\\" if its requirements are not met.

The park is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. It is available (by permit) for weddings and other programs. Description Maudslay State Park is a landscaped and decorative park along the right bank of the Merrimack River. It features thickets and gardens, rolling meadows, tall pines, and one of the largest naturally occurring stands of mountain laurel in the Commonwealth. Within the park, visitors can also find numerous ornamental trees, such as azaleas, and rhododendrons. The park is bordered on the west side by the Artichoke River, which is also the border between Newburyport and West Newbury. Curzon Mill, not currently used as a mill, and neighboring houses at the mouth of the Artichoke, where it flows into the Merrimack, remain in private hands. The bridge over the Artichoke is closed. =Pines and eagles= The most striking natural feature of the park is the primeval stands of white pine on the steep slopes and bluffs of the river, which appear never to have been logged. The laurel forms a continuous thicket along the forest floor around the pines, which are so tall that their tops are not visible in the upper canopy from below. The canopy is a nesting site for bald eagles, who from time to time disrupt traffic by perching in isolated pines hanging over the river outside of the park. The stands are found also in the few ravines that lace the park. =Merrimack River= The park covers approximately of the right bank of the Merrimack River, a tidal estuary at its lower end. The main channel of the estuary runs beneath the bluffs of the park. The channel is navigable to small craft and is marked by buoys. The swift currents and high bacteria counts render the waters useless for swimming or bathing, as well as adding an element of danger to the careless boater. Swimming in the Merrimack is prohibited from within Maudslay State Park. Seasonal floods often sweep away the docks, damage the bridges, flood the homes and wash out low-lying roads on the riverbank. Despite these dangers the lower river is home to a substantial industry of facilities for docking, storing and repairing recreational boats. The return of the eagles to their former habitat is related to the return of their food supply. By 1950 the Merrimack River was for the most part devoid of marine and riparian life, due to chemical effluents from the cloth and paper mills upstream in Haverhill, Lawrence, Lowell, Manchester, New Hampshire and Concord, New Hampshire as well as the dumping of raw sewage into the river from every community on its banks. Since then the industry has moved south, sewage is better treated and environmental laws have gone into effect and have been to some degree enforced in every community. Dams upstream prevent the return of migratory piscines but maritime life on the lower river has improved to the point of supporting a new population of eagles. =Upper woods= Colonial Newburyport lacked the bridges that currently link Newburyport with Salisbury and Amesbury on the left bank of the river. Newbury, West Newbury and Newburyport were originally the same parcel of land, settled in 1635 by an English party, which landed on the left bank of a river later (1697) renamed the Parker River, after the settlement's spiritual counselor, Rev. Parker. Before long the pine woods on the ridge of the right bank of the Merrimack had been cleared in favor of homesteads. \\"Country Lane\\" (High Street) led from Newbury to Bradford Road (Storey Street). The remaining forest between Bradford Road and the river was called the \\"Upper Woods\\", of which a small fragment hosts the eagles today. In 1641 the General Court of Massachusetts appointed George Carr official ferryman of the ferry he had started between Carr's and Ram Islands in the Merrimack to Colchester, settled in 1639 (shortly after renamed to Salisbury), which included today's Amesbury. Poore's Lane (Woodland Street) connected Country Lane to the ferry. A similar ferry crossed the Parker. The settlers were concerned with getting the links of the original coastal road, now Route 1A, in place. By 1654 a new settlement had developed around Emesbury Mill on the Powwow River. It needed a shorter route to Newbury than Carr's Ferry. In 1668 the General Court created Emesbury (Amesbury) and appointed one Mr. Goodwin ferryman of a new ferry to land near the mouth of the Powwow River. Newbury agreed to extend Country Lane past Bradford Road to the ferry. It was perhaps at that time that the future High Street became Ferry Road. Ferry Road ran along the right bank of the Merrimack to a gap in the bluffs of Upper Woods within the current borders of the park. The site is now forested with second growth. No visible trace of the ferry or the houses remains; however, Old Ferry Road appears there as an overgrown sunken lane between stone walls. Directly across the river is the Amesbury Public Landing. Goodman's Ferry changed hands a number of times, becoming Hook's Ferry at one time. It was discontinued in 1792 with the construction of the Essex Merrimack Bridge. History Italian garden, former Moseley Estate. The hedge in the background was intended to screen the greenhouses. The state park was created from the early 20th century estate of Frederick Strong Moseley, the son of Edward Strong Moseley, 1813‚Äì1900, a prominent citizen of Newburyport. Moseley is a variant of Maudesley or Maudesleigh, an English name appearing in the Domesday Book of 1080. The American ancestor, John, entered Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, taking up residence in Mattapan, the place depopulated by the death of the Massachusetts tribe of Native Americans by smallpox. John's descendants were Protestant ministers, missionaries to the natives, lawyers, patriots and soldiers of the Revolutionary War, abolitionists and soldiers of the Civil War. Up until Edward, the first names were all taken from the Old Testament. Edward's grandfather, Ebenezer, married Martha Strong, adding her name to the customary English triad of names. Martha's brother, Caleb, was a Massachusetts governor and served as one of the first senators from Massachusetts in the new federal government. Ebenezer's father, Samuel, had been a parson in Connecticut. \\"Chailey,\\" Charles William Moseley house in Newburyport, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1920. The house was built in 1915. Charles William Moseley (died 1920), a stock broker, was Frederick Strong Moseley's older brother The Moseleys were generally prolific, bearing several children each family. The descendants are widespread, bearing the same sorts of names and tending to the same sorts of businesses, including a line of financier Frederick Strong Moseleys, although the Newburyport estate is no longer in their ownership. One of the sons of Ebenezer and Martha, also Ebenezer, after graduating from Yale settled in Newburyport in 1805 and had a distinguished career as a lawyer, legislator and officer of the 6th Massachusetts Militia. He helped to found a bank and an insurance company. His son, Edward, went to Yale for a few years, resigned, and became an agent for a Boston merchant in the East India trade, Benjamin Gould, starting as a clerk. He eventually came to own a share in 99 wooden ships built by the Currier shipyard of Newburyport. He was a trustee in a wide variety of organizations, a corporate director of numerous companies, a major philanthropist and especially a successful bank president in Mechanicks National Bank and the Institute for Savings. His special concern was to house and maintain the Newburyport Public Library, founded 1854, in which he was joined by some of his philanthropic friends, such as George Peabody, merchant, slaver and founder of the public libraries in Danvers, Massachusetts and Peabody, Massachusetts, named after him. In 1839 Edward married Charlotte Chapman, a beauty from Newark, New Jersey, who was also an episcopal minister's daughter. They had many children, only five of which survived to adulthood, including Frederick Strong Moseley, born in 1852, who became a broker in Boston and was a director of the Shawmut Bank there. On Edward's death in 1900, the children inherited a not inconsiderable estate. Frederick proceeded to acquire and improve the Newburyport property, consulting and hiring the best landscape architects in Massachusetts of the day. Originally named Maudesleigh, the estate was created on agricultural fields by landscape architect Martha Brookes Hutcheson, one of the earliest female members of the American Society of Landscape Architects, who designed the grounds around the main house, entry drive, and formal gardens (1904‚Äì1906). Lord and Burnham designed various of the greenhouses. At its peak, about 40 staff serviced the estate's three greenhouses, head house, cold frames, espaliered fruit trees, winter plant house, formal vegetable and cutting garden, perennial border, Italian garden, rose garden, and rhododendrons, azaleas, and specimen trees, as well as the site's native mountain laurels. William G. Rantoul, of the Boston firm Jacques and Rantoul, served as the estate's principal architect, creating most of the original architecture in the years 1895-1910. He designed the 72-room main house (demolished 1955) and houses for the coachman, forester, and head gardener. A second large house was built 1939-1941 for Helen Moseley, Frederick's younger daughter. In the early 1950s the privacy and remoteness of the estate were diminished with the construction of Route 95 through the middle of upper woods and the contemporaneous construction of Route 495 at the top of the left bank of the river, both of which became major routes for heavy trucks. Highway noise in the park during business hours is insistent. On the death of the Moseleys the family had the main house torn down. In 1978 Helen's house was destroyed by fire. Today only few of some 30 structures remain. =State park= In 1985 the property was acquired by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management to become Maudslay State Park. The main gate, the drives, the stone bridges and overlooks have survived, as well as stands of lilac, rhododendron and some of the fruit trees. The sites of the grand houses have been leveled. The tops of the foundations are visible in the mowed lawn. The swimming pool of the main house is empty and is choked with thickets. Except for select locations, the gardens and greenhouses have fallen into ruin, the walls scarcely visible on the overgrown hillside. The dairy farm on the property survived and was a working farm in good repair until the early 1980s. The park service has added a parking lot. A nearby house became the park headquarters. A staff of rangers and grounds employees maintain the meadows and trails and conduct guided tours; however, visitors are welcome to hike the trails, except for areas restricted for ecological purposes. A memorial running course has been delineated. It winds through the meadows and pines. Rest rooms and shower facilities were constructed in the parking lot. Equestrian parties on the larger trails are common. The horses are often brought in privately in trailers, which park in the meadow next to the lot. Since 1987, Maudslay State Park has been the home of Theater in the Open, which performs three live outdoor shows in the park throughout the year. The theater is also known for their giant puppet pageant every May called \\"The Rites of Spring\\" and their walk in October called \\"Maudslay is Haunted\\". Maudslay State Park barn fire on April 3, 2010 On April 3, 2010 around 1:58 P.M., the Coachman's Barn, which was customarily used for the Theater in the Open, caught fire. The Newburyport, Salisbury and Amesbury Fire Departments got the blaze under control around 3:30 P.M. Only the stone foundation and the chimney survived. The chimney has been taken down for safety reasons. The small house next to the barn was largely untouched. Activities and amenities The park has trails for walking, hiking, horseback riding, and cross-country skiing, and is also the home course of the Newburyport High School Cross Country Running team. There are also educational programs, picnicking facilities, and restrooms.

Early life J√°uregui was born in Lec√°roz, the son of Mat√≠as de J√°uregui and of his wife, Juana Mar√≠a de Aldecoa. At the age of 25 he entered the military, serving at Cartagena de Indias (now in Colombia) during the British siege in 1740. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general, and became a knight of the Order of Santiago. Before his appointment as governor of Chile, he also served in Honduras, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1772, while resident in Spain, he was named governor by authority of King Charles III. In October of that year he embarked for Peru with his son Tom√°s. His wife, a native of Havana whom he had married there, remained in Spain. As governor of Chile J√°uregui was governor of Chile from March 6, 1772, to 1780, during which time he promulgated a number of administrative and governmental reforms. For example, he set up a postal service on April 29, 1775. He oversaw Chile's first census, which established the population at 259,646 inhabitants, in 1778. In June 1772 he introduced a severe ordinance intended to preserve public order. Individuals could not bear arms in public; theft of animals was to be punished by whipping; shopkeepers who did not close at the proper hour were subject to fines. With the agreement of Bishop Alday, he restricted the right of asylum in churches to only two, Santa Ana and San Isidro. He introduced reforms of the tax-collection system in 1772. For many taxes he ended the farming system (collection by third parties, for a percentage of the revenue), and required that taxes be paid directly to the Crown. This included the customs. The reforms were opposed by the merchants, but J√°uregui put them into effect anyway. He held a series of formal meeting with indigenous leaders. In April 1774 he met with their ambassadors in Santiago and he met with various leaders in the Parliament of Tapihue the following December. One of the things agreed to was the establishment of a school for the Indigenous, to be run by the Jesuits. This was the Colegio de San Pablo, which opened in April 1775 in Santiago. J√°uregui presided over the beginning of construction of the cathedral of Santiago, under the direction of the Italian architect he recruited, Gioacchino Toesca. The cathedral was consecrated on December 8, 1775. Also, the Real Universidad de San Felipe enjoyed growth during his tenure. The Academy of Forensic Practice was established, and attached to the University. In 1776 the Captaincy General of Chile suffered the loss of the province of Cuyo, including the cities of Mendoza, San Juan, and San Luis, due to the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. In 1777 J√°uregui established a militia system to defend against rural banditry and prepare for other military action, although each unit was required to finance uniforms and weapons itself. Two cavalry regiments, with 1,400 men, were created, and one new infantry regiment, with 800 men. In the professional army, the forces were redistributed along the frontier in Arauco, and in Santiago. He proposed better pay for the troops, and this was approved by Charles III in January 1778. By royal order, free trade among various ports in Spain and America was adopted in 1778. Included were Valpara√≠so and Concepci√≥n in Chile. The order also authorized the route around Cape Horn. This was an important benefit for the colony. Also in 1778 the Colegio de San Carlos was founded in Santiago. This replaced the Convictorio de San Francisco Javier, which had been administered by the Jesuits up until their expulsion. In May 1778 the Mapocho River flooded. As viceroy of Peru In 1780, J√°uregui was named viceroy of Peru. The reception in honor of his arrival (July 20) included a speech of welcome by the Peruvian intellectual Jos√© Baqu√≠jano. Almost before the celebrations in Lima in honour of his arrival had ended, he had to confront the insurrection of T√∫pac Amaru II (Jos√© Gabriel Condorcanqui). T√∫pac Amaru was a direct descendant of the earlier T√∫pac Amaru, the last Inca (Emperor) of Vilcabamba, who had been beheaded on the orders of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo in 1572. T√∫pac Amaru II was cacique of Tungasuca, Surimana and Pampamarca, and enjoyed properties, businesses and prestige in the region of Cusco. He was 40 years old when he led the rebellion, tired of the abuses of the corregidores and merchants and of the reforms of Visitador Jos√© Antonio de Areche (customs, taxes, tributes). T√∫pac Amaru had been organizing a conspiracy since 1778. The revolt began on November 4, 1780. On that date, he captured and condemned to the gallows the corregidor of Tinta, Antonio de Arriaga. The same day he spoke to thousands of followers at Tungasuca, announcing the abolition of mita (forced labour), obraje (another form of forced labour), black slavery, the sales tax and the corregidors. J√°uregui succeeded in defeating T√∫pac Amaru in 1781, and within a month he had been arrested and tried. On May 18, 1781, T√∫pac Amaru, his wife, and other leaders were executed. T√∫pac Amaru himself was torn into pieces by four horses, and the pieces were publicly displayed in various Indian towns as a warning to future rebels. Other rebels were brutally tortured and killed between 1781 and 1783. It is not known whether any descendants of the Inca emperors survived the repression. However, discontent persisted amongst the native peoples because of abuse of the repartimiento and mita systems of labor tribute, which J√°uregui notified the court of. J√°uregui also busied himself in improving the defenses, the militia, and the postal service of the viceroyalty. He left his post on April 6, 1784, and a few days later died in an accident in Lima.

Since they were re- established in 1992, Croatia has been divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, which has the authority and legal status of both a county and a city (separate from the surrounding Zagreb County). As of 2015, the counties are subdivided into 128 cities and 428 (mostly rural) municipalities. Government County assembly () is a representative and deliberative body in each county. Assembly members are elected for a four-year term by popular vote (proportional system with closed lists and d'Hondt method) in local elections. The executive branch of each county's government is headed by a county prefect (county president) (), except that a mayor heads the city of Zagreb's executive branch. Croatia's county prefects (with two deputy prefects), mayor of Zagreb (with two deputy mayors) are elected for a four-year term by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting (majoritarian vote, two-round system). County prefects (with deputy prefects and mayor of Zagreb with his/her deputies) can be recalled by a referendum. County administrative bodies are administrative departments and services which are established for the performance of works in the self-governing domain of the county, as well as for the performance of works of state administration transferred to the county. Administrative departments and services are managed by heads (principals) nominated by the county prefect on the basis of a public competition. In each county exists a State Administration Office () which performs the tasks of the central government (under Ministry of Public Administration). Head of State Administration Office (predstojnik Ureda dr≈æavne uprave), who is a university graduate in law, is appointed by the Croatian Government (in the City of Zagreb the mayor is responsible for the state administration).These offices (\\"administrations\\") are not subordinate to the county assembly or county prefect, but rather the direct presence of the state (similar to governorates or prefectures in certain countries). Funding and tasks The counties are funded by the central government, as well as from county-owned businesses, county taxes and county fees. County taxes include a five percent inheritance and gift tax, a motor vehicle tax, a vessel tax and an arcade game machine tax. The counties are tasked with performing general public administration services, primary and secondary education, government funded healthcare, social welfare, administration pertaining to agriculture, forestry, hunting, fisheries, mining, industry and construction, and other services to the economy at the county level, as well as road transport infrastructure management and issuing of building and location permits and other document in relation to construction in the county area excluding the area of the big city and the county seat city; the central government and local (city and municipal) governments may also perform each of those tasks at their respective levels according to the law. The Croatian County Association () was set up in 2003 as a framework for inter-county cooperation. Nomenclature The Croatian (singular) term ≈æupanija was originally applied to territory controlled by a ≈æupan (official title). Since the 12th century, the counties have also been referred to by the Latin term comitatus. History 10th century Croatia, overlaid on a map of modern Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovinaalt=Map of approximate locations of early medieval counties of Croatia Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimiroviƒá's rule. The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority. The following fourteen are usually listed as the oldest counties of Croatia, dating back to the 10th century: * Livno (encompassing the Livanjsko polje) * Cetina (centered on the Cetina river, with its seat in Stolac) * Imotski (south of Livno County and Biokovo) * Pliva (around the Pliva and Vrbas rivers) * Pset or Pesenta (between the Una and Sana rivers) * Primorje or Klis (along the Adriatic's coast between ≈†ibenik and Omi≈°, with its seat in the Klis Fortress) * Bribir (to the west of Primorje County) * Nona (around Nin and Zadar) * Knin (with its seat in the Knin Fortress) * Sidraga (in the area between Bribir County and Zadar) * Nina or Luka (between Knin, Nona, Sidraga and Bribir counties) * Gacka * Krbava * Lika The ban ruled over three ≈æupas Krbava, Lika, and Gacka in Western Croatia, approximately today's Lika-Senj County territory. In the same period, the counties in Pannonian Croatia (north of Gvozd Mountain) are poorly documented. It is generally thought that the Pannonian counties were directly subject to the Croatian monarchy, unlike the southern counties controlled by nobles. The county number, extent and authority have varied significantly, reflecting: changes in the monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760. The divisions have changed over time, reflecting: territorial losses to Ottoman conquest and subsequent Croatian recapture of some territory; changes in the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria; and political circumstances, including the personal union and settlement between Croatia and Hungary. In the 19th century, the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas brought upon numerous political changes and introduced a civic government of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as part of Austria- Hungary, which in turn proceeded to absorb the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontiers in 1881. During the second half of the 19th century Croatian counties went through various reorganizations (1848‚Äì1850, 1850‚Äì1854, 1854‚Äì1861, 1861‚Äì1870, 1870‚Äì1874, 1874‚Äì1886, 1886‚Äì1914) that also reflected the position of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austrian Empire (after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy); the last major reorganisation of the counties was in 1886, when eight counties were established within the kingdom. This layout largely remained in effect until the Croatian counties were abolished in 1922, while some minor adjustments of county boundaries happened in 1913. The counties were set up as self-governmental units in contrast to earlier county incarnations since the Middle Ages. Each had an assembly (Croatian ≈æupanijska skup≈°tina) with the wealthiest taxpayers comprising half the assembly members and elected members comprising the remaining half. Supreme prefect (Croatian veliki ≈æupan) was appointed by the king and county officials by the ban. Managing board of each county had 6 members elected by the county assembly, while the remaining members were county officials ex officio (supreme prefect, viceprefect, county health supervisor etc.). Counties were divided into districts (Croatian kotari as government units similar to Austrian Bezirke), while municipalities (Croatian opƒáine) and cities (Croatian gradovi) were units of local self-government. The traditional division of Croatia into counties was abolished in 1922, when the oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were introduced; these were later replaced by the banovinas of Yugoslavia. Socialist Republic of Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia had approximately 100 municipalities as main governmental units and local government entities. The counties were reintroduced in 1992, but with significant territorial alterations from the pre-1922 subdivisions; for instance, before 1922 Transleithanian Croatia was divided into eight counties, but the new legislation established fourteen counties in the same territory. Meƒëimurje County was established in the eponymous region acquired through the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. The county borders have sometimes changed since their 1992 restoration (for reasons such as historical ties and requests by cities); the latest revision took place in 2006. Today's counties correspond to tier three of the European Union (EU) Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia. The NUTS Local Administrative Unit (LAU) divisions are two-tiered; the LAU 1 divisions for Croatia also match the counties (in effect making these the same as the NUTS 3 units).

The phyllosphere can be further subdivided into the caulosphere (stems), phylloplane (leaves), anthosphere (flowers), and carposphere (fruits). The below-ground microbial habitats (i.e. the thin-volume of soil surrounding root or subterranean stem surfaces) are referred to as the rhizosphere and laimosphere. Most plants host diverse communities of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protists . Some are beneficial to the plant, others function as plant pathogens and may damage the host plant or even kill it. However, the majority of microbial colonists on any given plant have no detectable effect on plant growth or function. Research into the characteristics of microbial life in the phyllosphere is of great commercial importance to the agricultural industry for two reasons. First, understanding the survival of plant disease-causing bacteria and fungi is vital for developing new ways to control their spread. Second, there has been food poisoning cases associated with fruit and vegetables contaminated with bacteria, such as Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. This is particularly true of fresh fruits and salads which are not cooked prior to consumption. Preventing these outbreaks by developing better decontamination strategies is important to protect public health. For microorganisms the phyllosphere can be considered a hostile environment however, since there is a limited availability of nutrients, strong sun irradiation and variation in water availability.

It is based in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is owned by Tiso Blackstar Group (formerly Johnnic Communications, Avusa & Times Media Group). The current Gallo Record Company is a hybrid of two rival South African record labels between the 1940s and 1980s: the original Gallo Africa (1926‚Äì85) and G.R.C. (Gramophone Record Company, 1939‚Äì85). In 1985 Gallo Africa acquired G.R.C.; as a result, Gallo Africa became known as Gallo-GRC. Five years after the acquisition, the company was renamed Gallo Record Company. History Eric Gallo set up a one-man business, the Brunswick Gramophone House, in 1926. The record shop was originally devised to distribute records from the US-based Brunswick Records into South Africa. However, noticing the lack of recording facilities (as well as the amount of local talent) in the country, Gallo decided to form a recording studio in 1932 and, borrowing equipment (and a sound engineer) from the then just-defunct Metropole company in the United Kingdom, Gallo opened the \\"Gallo Recording Studios\\" under the auspices of Gallo Africa (using a red rooster as the company's symbol, which remains today). Gallo was South Africa's first recording company and became home to a number of classic recordings, including the infamous \\"Mbube\\" (recorded in 1939 by Solomon Linda and his \\"Original Evening Birds\\"). A wealth of local artists had recordings released on Gallo's many labels, including \\"Singer\\", \\"Gallotone\\", \\"Gallo New Sound\\", \\"USA\\", and many more. African music (or \\"black music\\", as it was then known) was produced by Griffith Motsieloa, a local talent scout whom Gallo had recruited to his fold. Throughout the 1950s, Gallo remained successful, though it was competing against the South African branch of EMI. EMI's African music division, led by black talent scout Rupert Bopape, prospered well into the early 1960s with marabi and African jazz recordings by luminaries such as the Dark City Sisters and others. Gallo lost sales in its own black music unit, led by saxophonist-producer Reggie Msomi and scout Walter Nhlapo, and so, in 1964, the company poached Bopape to join Gallo. Bopape formed the Mavuthela Music Company division of Gallo Africa, recording famous and local mbaqanga and jive artists, and was promoted as \\"South Africa's Motown\\" (the acclaimed Mavuthela quintet, the Mahotella Queens, was perhaps the South African equivalent to Motown's trio of stars, The Supremes). Dozens of recordings were issued on labels such as \\"Motella\\", \\"Gumba Gumba\\", \\"CTC Star Records\\", \\"FGB\\", \\"Gallotone\\", \\"USA\\", and many more. Also in the 1950s they started producing the Gallotone guitar. Arnold Golembo founded the Gramophone Record Company (G.R.C.) in Johannesburg in 1939. GRC obtained the South African franchise for the Capitol Records label in 1946 (later moved to EMI Brigadiers), and the franchise for CBS in 1956. In 1985, G.R.C. was incorporated into Gallo Africa. The company was named Gallo-GRC, and incorporated Gallo's production stable, Mavuthela, and GRC's production stable, Isibaya Esikhulu. These stables had been fierce rivals from around the mid-1960s up to Gallo's take-over of G.R.C. The company was renamed Gallo Record Company in 1990. Producers at Gallo included West Nkosi, who was an influential and intimidating figure at the company from 1964 until his death in 1997. Nkosi was a member of the Makgona Tsohle Band, which backed up all of Mavuthela's (1964‚Äì1985) mbaqanga artists such as the Mahotella Queens, Abafana Baseqhudeni, Mahlathini, and many others. Nkosi introduced to Gallo some of its most well-known artists - these included Ladysmith Black Mambazo (1972), The Green Arrows (1974), Mpharanyana and the Cannibals (1976), and Amaswazi Emvelo (1978). Other figures at Gallo over the years have included talent scouts Rupert Bopape and Louis Abel Petersen as well as musician-composer- arrangers such as Shadrack Piliso, Marks Mankwane, Hilda Tloubatla, Lucky Monama, Joseph Shabalala, Simon Mahlathini Nkabinde and Thandi Nkomo, in addition to figures such as Eric Gallo, Peter Gallo, and others. In 2006, Johnnic Communications (Gallo's parent company, which changed its name to Avusa in November 2007) entered a joint venture with the South African division of Warner Music International, forming Warner Music Gallo Africa, making Gallo Record Company's entire music archive digitally available for the first time. These include rare pressings as well as classic hits by artists such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Letta Mbulu, Spokes Mashiyane, Lucky Dube, Yvonne Chaka Chaka and others.

In the past, he has voiced television coverage of Formula One, Superleague Formula and the British Touring Car Championship, in addition to Formula One DVD Reviews for Duke Video. After spending well over a decade working for networks including Eurosport, ESPN, ITV and F1 Digital +, he was named the BBC's lead TV commentator on its Formula One coverage from 2012 in December 2011. He is known for his enthusiastic and energetic commentary style. Career =Starting out= Brought up in Surrey, Edwards first started out in motorsport as a mechanic for Formula Ford teams in 1982, before beginning a career as a racing driver. He won the first Formula First championship, a now defunct championship for new drivers, and went to become champion in Caterham-Vauxhall sports cars. He also took part in the Euro Vauxhall Lotus championship where he raced against the likes of David Coulthard, who is now his co-commentator, and Mika H√§kkinen. He first started commentating after enjoying his experience teaching racing at Brands Hatch and Snetterton. His first commentary position was for the BBC with Tiff Needell, but he became known to British viewers through his Formula One commentary on Eurosport. He was usually partnered with former Formula One race winner John Watson. =Champ Car= When Eurosport lost the rights to Formula One at the end of 1996, Edwards became the voice of Champ Car racing for viewers of Eurosport and ESPN International, also carried by Channel 5. His work alongside Jeremy Shaw was regarded as a big success. Perhaps his most famous moment was his commentary of the final lap of the 2000 Michigan 500 which was so dramatic that French Eurosport used his commentary in their highlights of that race. Although Edwards was very popular with the viewers, he gradually became tired of commuting from Britain to the United States for every race. He considered moving permanently to the United States. He eventually decided to remain in England, and reduce his involvement in America. In 2001, Edwards was replaced by Guy Hobbs as the main Champ Car commentator, but he did commentate for the races in Japan, Detroit, Mid-Ohio, Germany, Houston and Australia when Hobbs or Shaw had other commitments, and at the Rockingham Motor Speedway race. =Return to England= In 2002, Edwards joined ITV to commentate on the British Touring Car Championship. He also took on the role of lead commentator for F1 Digital +, and was reunited with his old colleague, John Watson. F1 Digital + finished at the end of the 2002 season, but since 2005 Watson and Edwards have been working together on Sky Sports and the international feed for A1 Grand Prix. On occasions when British Touring Car Championship and A1 Grand Prix races clashed, he was replaced on ITV by John Hindhaugh. Edwards has also commentated on other motorsport events for Eurosport and British TV, including coverage of the British Formula Three Championship (alongside Martin Haven), and the Superleague Formula series. =BBC F1= On 13 December 2011, it was confirmed that Edwards would replace Martin Brundle as the BBC's lead commentator for Formula One in 2012, working alongside David Coulthard. Toby Moody took Edwards' place for the BTCC in 2012. Edwards worked across BBC TV, Radio and online. =Channel 4 F1= In 2016, Edwards moved to Channel 4 to continue commentating on Formula 1, again working alongside David Coulthard. The move came after the BBC terminated its TV rights agreement early, and Channel 4 picked the deal up. Personal life Edwards, with his wife Belinda, runs Entreprix Ltd., a \\"motorsports specialist\\" company. Founded in 1987, the company has managed numerous motorsport championships, the most recent being the British GT Championship from 2003-2005. He currently resides in Wortham, Suffolk.

Epstein, and Hahne & Company in 1972. The mall benefited from the migration of population in Northern New Jersey to suburban and exurban areas, and the exodus of shoppers and stores from downtown Newark, once Northern New Jersey's premiere shopping mecca that was in serious decline since the July 1967 race riots. Both Bamberger's and Hahne & Co. had massive flagship stores in downtown Newark at the time of the mall opening. Sears also had a store on Elizabeth Avenue in Newark's once popular South Ward. In 1986, the Bamberger's store transformed into Macy's. In 1985, Hahne's gave way to Lord & Taylor when its parent company, which owned both banners, decided to retire the Hahne's brand. Around this time the M. Epstein store was converted to an annex for Macy's. Sears remained the mall's sole original anchor until its closure in 2020.

This surgery is performed in rare cases of severe chronic pain where no other treatments have been successful, and for other conditions such as vertigo, involuntary twitching and excessive blushing or sweating. A brief \\"rehearsal\\" local anesthetic nerve block is usually performed before the actual neurectomy, to determine efficacy and detect side effects. The patient is typically under general anesthetic during the neurectomy, which is performed by a neurosurgeon or plastic surgeon. Procedures =Presacral neurectomy= A presacral neurectomy is typically conducted to decrease severe pain and menstrual cramps in the lower abdomen. Pain in this region is difficult to treat with noninvasive treatments. Endometriosis is the most common cause for this severe pain. One solution that doctors often mistakenly recommend as a cure is a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus. However, this often does not relieve endometriosis pain because the disease is left behind on other organs such as the bladder, bowels, or pelvic side walls, and it can thrive on its own hormone supply. Another is to perform a presacral neurectomy. This is a procedure that interrupts the nerves going towards and/or around the uterus. Pain located on either side of the lower abdomen (but not mid line) should not be treated with a neurectomy. Only individuals with pain that is not relieved by the use of NSAIDs should consider this procedure. Techniques have been developed for this procedure to be performed laparoscopically. The incision is typically directly under the navel. Normally three small holes are made in the lower abdomen to allow for the instruments and other various surgical tools. Nerve tissue that runs to the uterus is interrupted at the sacral promontory; a point at which spine and tailbones meet. This is the best area to access and obtain a clear view of the nerves in the uterus. Proper precautions must be taken as to avoid unnecessary complications with the major blood vessels surrounding the uterus. Some of the complications post-operation include urinary retention, as well as constipation. Neither has been reported to cause lasting effects. Recent technological advances have allowed this same procedure to be done robotically, a minimally invasive technique similar to laparoscopy. The outcome of the procedure is identical to an open approach (laparotomy), but the incisions are much smaller allowing for less post-operation pain. Less pain following this surgery allows for a quicker recovery period too; two weeks as opposed to six weeks, on average. =Vestibular neurectomy= A vestibular neurectomy is an operation that severs the vestibular nerve, which contributes to balance, while sparing the cochlear nerve, which contributes to hearing. The procedure has the potential to relieve vertigo, but may preserve the ability to hear. It is important to note that this procedure will not reverse the effects of deafness. The risks include: hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, facial weakness, spinal fluid leak, and various infections. There are several different surgical approaches that can be used to complete this procedure: the middle cranial fossa, retrolabrynthine, retrosigmoid, and translabrynthine. The middle cranial fossa approach is one that most often requires neurosurgical expertise. The advantage of this procedure is that the vestibular nerve is clearly visible and can be sectioned without harming the cochlear nerve fibers. The general procedure begins by positioning the patient supine with the head turned to the side with surgical ear upright. An incision is made at the lower portion of the zygomatic root to the area of the temporal region for roughly seven centimeters. Precautions are taken by clamping flaps of tissue as to not impede further actions. To expose the IAC (Inner Auditory Canal) properly, portions of bone from the metal fundus and also the tegmen tympani must be removed. The SVN (superior vestibular nerve) is then identified and cut at the point furthest from the vestibular crest. Along with the SVN, Scarpa's ganglion is also cut and removed. In cases of M√©ni√®re's disease, a neurectomy may be needed when no other medical treatment is sufficient for over six months. In bilateral M√©ni√®re's disease, the procedure is done on the worse-off ear. Some procedures are done on both ears, but the risk of hearing loss then becomes significantly greater. =Pulsed radiofrequency ablation neurectomy= Some ablations that have been previously performed laparoscopically are also now offered via the pulsed radiofrequency technique. Pulsed radiofrequency ablation relies on delivering an electrical field specifically to neural tissue in order to damage it while minimizing injury to the surrounding area. For example, this technique has been used in patients with chronic shoulder pain as a way to perform a neurectomy of the suprascapular nerve with less risk of damage to nearby muscles within the rotator cuff. There is still a lack of evidence directly comparing the efficacy and safety of this technique compared to the traditional laparoscopic method, but there is evidence that it improves range of motion and pain compared to placebo or sham surgery. Use in horses Neurectomy is also used in equine medicine, primarily for cases of persistent lameness that is non- responsive to other forms of treatment. It is most commonly used for animals suffering from navicular syndrome and suspensory ligament desmitis.

I see it as my challenge to help turn the club around, not to just give up and walk away. You might get cranky at some things, but you've got to ride the good times and the bad times. That‚Äôs what it's all about.\\" Farah was chosen again to play for City, a record sixth appearance for a hooker, and the fourth consecutive time as captain. Farah was selected to play hooker for NSW in the 2013 Series in all 3 games. On 12 July, following an injury to Paul Gallen, Farah was named captain for NSW for the first time for the series-deciding third game. Unfortunately for New South Wales, Queensland won the game 12‚Äì10.

The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"his workload with and without the ball was huge, completing a game-high 55 tackles and cleaning up a Cooper Cronk grubber kick when the Maroons appeared poised to score. No wonder the Queenslanders wanted him off the park.\\" Between the first and second State of Origin matches, Farah made no appearances for the Wests Tigers dues to his shoulder injury. It was said he, \\"Seemed to have a target painted on that bung shoulder,\\" as Queensland forced him to make a game-high 48 tackles in the second game of the series as NSW won the game 26‚Äì18 at the MCG. In August, Farah was given permission from the Tigers to investigate opportunities to continue his playing career at another club from 2016 onward. Farah finished the 2015 NRL season with him playing in 17 matches and scoring 2 tries. During the 2015 off-season, Farah's contract saga was highly publicized. There were reports of Farah being demoted to New South Wales Cup if he stayed, his relationship with coach Jason Taylor turning sour, and about his $800,000 a season contract chewing up the Tigers salary cap. Farah dropped himself as the Tigers captain and was replaced by Aaron Woods, having set a club record 148 matches as captain. =2016= With Farah missing some games early in the season, it was noted that Wests Tigers had won one game from seven with him playing, and four of six games he was absent from. There was further drama when Jason Taylor chose to play him from the bench and rested him after State of Origin matches. He was chosen for all 3 games for NSW, and it was said, \\"Running Robbie ran the Queenslanders ragged early on and added 44-tackles to another quality Origin performance,\\" in game 2. He topped the tackle count again in the third match, the only match won by NSW. A week later, Farah was dropped to reserve grade by Jason Taylor and remained in NSW cup until the end of the season. He then signed with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ending a thirteen-year career with the Wests Tigers. Farah finished his drama-filled season with 2 tries in 9 appearances. Farah with North Sydney =2017= In Round 1, Farah made his highly anticipated club debut for the Rabbitohs against his former club of 13 seasons the Wests Tigers. He started at hooker in the 18‚Äì34 loss at ANZ Stadium. In round 2, against Manly-Warringah, Farah scored his first try for the Rabbitohs at Brookvale Oval. In Round 3, against the Newcastle Knights, Farah played his 250th milestone match in the 24‚Äì18 win at Hunter Stadium. Farah played all 24 of Souths matches for the season, alternating between starting at hooker and playing from the bench. Farah returned to representing Lebanon for the 2017 World Cup and played in the country's first ever World Cup match victory over France on 29 October 2017. =2018= Having shared the role of hooker with Damien Cook in 2017, Farah was demoted to reserve grade with the North Sydney Bears at the start of 2018, with Cook taking on the role full-time. Farah later said he considered retirement during this time. \\"I just didn‚Äôt want to be there. It was hard, mate. Really hard. I don‚Äôt want to disrespect Norths because they are a great club ‚Ä¶ but it was embarrassing for me. You get there, you get heckled by the crowd. There's always a smart-arse.\\" Farah made his first appearance for Souths in their Round 13 victory over Cronulla, filling in while Cook played State of Origin. Despite his absence from first grade, Farah was praised for his performance which included \\"a whopping\\" 62 tackles. On 21 June, Farah returned to the West Tigers on a mid-season transfer, and was chosen as the first grade hooker the same week. Souths General manager Shane Richardson said they would not have released Farah to any other club, but, \\"The reason we let Robbie go was because it was the right thing to do.\\" He had made 2 appearances for Souths before his departure. On 21 July, he played his 250th game for the Wests Tigers in their victory over ladder- leaders, the Rabbitohs. During the match, Farah was knocked out in the 71st minute when he attempted to tackle Souths player George Burgess. Farah started at hooker for every game at Wests Tigers after he rejoined the club, making 9 appearances. Farah's contract renewal for 2019 was announced at the same time as long-time teammate Benji Marshall. He said, \\"Once he texted me late last night to tell me he was staying on again, it relieved the nerves, to be honest. To know he was there for another year - the two old boys at the club - it made me feel a lot better.\\" =2019= Declared the \\"King of Leichhardt\\" in round 1, Farah scored two tries and topped the tackle count for the Tigers. He said, \\"The boys calling us grand-dads and stuff... I try and take that a bit personal, you know. I go out there and try and challenge the younger boys and try and show them that the old fella's still got it.\\" On 24 July, Farah spoke to the media ahead of his 300th first grade appearance and how he had received messages of support. Farah then used the opportunity to speak about former Wests Tigers head coach Jason Taylor saying ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to hear from JT anyway, At the time I was told by him and Rod Reddy, I‚Äôd finish my career in reserve grade. But I‚Äôm here now - ‚ÄòJT‚Äô is coaching reserve grade‚Äô‚Äô. Farah went on to say ‚ÄúI was running around with the Bears in NSW Cup and I was ready to walk away from the game. It was pretty hard to try and find the motivation to go and play and I thought I was done. In round 21 against Canterbury- Bankstown, Farah was taken from the field during the club's 18-16 loss at ANZ Stadium with a leg injury. Scans revealed that Farah had suffered a leg fracture. On 19 August 2019, Farah spoke to the media saying that he was considering going against doctors advice to play. Farah went on to say \\"If we've got to win to make the semis, I'll cut it off if I have to, at the end of the day it's my decision but they definitely recommended that (I don't play again). It's just a matter of gathering the information from them as best I could and whatever risk I put upon myself is my decision\\" In round 25 of the 2019 NRL season, Farah was ruled out of the Wests Tigers game against Cronulla-Sutherland but was then dramatically recalled to the team as Wests player Corey Thompson was injured in the warm up. Wests went into the game with Cronulla knowing that the winner would reach the finals. Farah lead Wests out onto the field of a packed Leichhardt Oval in what would be his final game as a player as Cronulla won the match 25‚Äì8. =Highlights= *First Grade Debut: 2003 ‚Äì Round 13, Wests Tigers v Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Leichhardt Oval, Sydney - 8 June 2003 *Premierships: 2005 ‚Äì Wests Tigers defeated North Queensland Cowboys 30 - 16 in the Grand Final, Stadium Australia, Sydney - 2 October 2005 *Wests Tigers Club Captain: 2009-2015 *Lebanon Test Debut: 2002 ‚Äì Mediterranean Cup, Lebanon v France, International Olympic Stadium, Tripoli, Lebanon - 3 November 2002 *NSW City Origin Debut: 2006 ‚Äì NSW City Origin v NSW Country Origin, Apex Oval, Dubbo, New South Wales - 12 May 2006. *NSW City Origin Selection: 2006‚Äì2007, 2009-2012 *NSW City Origin Captain: 2009-2012 *Prime Minister's XIII Debut: 2006 ‚Äì Prime Minister's XIII v Papua New Guinea, Lloyd Robson Oval, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea - 30 September 2006 *Prime Minister's XIII Selection: 2006, 2008-2009 *New South Wales Debut: 2009 ‚Äì State of Origin Game 1, New South Wales v Queensland, Docklands Stadium, Melbourne - 3 June 2009 *New South Wales Selection: 2009, 2012-2014 *New South Wales Captain: 2013 ‚Äì State of Origin Game 3, New South Wales v Queensland, ANZ Stadium, Sydney - 17 July 2013. *Australia Test Debut: 2009 ‚Äì Rugby League Four Nations Round 2, Australia v England, DW Stadium, Wigan, England - 31 October 2009 *Australia Test Squad Selection: 2009-2011 *NRL All Stars Debut: 2010 ‚Äì NRL All Stars v Indigenous All Stars at Skilled Park, Robina, Queensland - 13 February 2010. =Honours= * 2010 RLIF Team of the Year * 2010 Dally M Player of the Year runner-up * 2010 Dally M Hooker of the Year * 2007 Dally M Player of the Year runner-up * 2007 Dally M Hooker of the Year References External links *Wests Tigers profile *South Sydney Rabbitohs profile *Rabbitohs profile *2017 RLWC profile 1984 births Australian people of Lebanese descent Australia national rugby league team players Lebanon national rugby league team players Wests Tigers players South Sydney Rabbitohs players North Sydney Bears NSW Cup players New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players NRL All Stars players Wests Tigers NSW Cup players Prime Minister's XIII players Prime Minister's XIII captains Rugby league hookers Rugby league players from Sydney Living people ","title":"Robbie Farah"},{"id":"5746507","title":"Breeders Crown Winners"},{"id":"5746522","text":"iCub is a 1 metre tall open source robotics humanoid robot testbed for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence. It was designed by the RobotCub Consortium of several European universities and built by Italian Institute of Technology, and is now supported by other projects such as ITALK. The robot is open-source, with the hardware design, software and documentation all released under the GPL license. The name is a partial acronym, cub standing for Cognitive Universal Body. Initial funding for the project was ‚Ç¨8.5 million from Unit E5 - Cognitive Systems and Robotics - of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme, and this ran for 65 months from 1 September 2004 until 31 January 2010. The motivation behind the strongly humanoid design is the embodied cognition hypothesis, that human-like manipulation plays a vital role in the development of human cognition. A baby learns many cognitive skills by interacting with its environment and other humans using its limbs and senses, and consequently its internal model of the world is largely determined by the form of the human body. The robot was designed to test this hypothesis by allowing cognitive learning scenarios to be acted out by an accurate reproduction of the perceptual system and articulation of a small child so that it could interact with the world in the same way that such a child does.  Specifications  An iCub at a live demo making facial expressions The dimensions of the iCub are similar to that of a 3.5-year-old child. The robot is controlled by an on-board PC104 controller which communicates with actuators and sensors using CANBus. It utilises tendon driven joints for the hand and shoulder, with the fingers flexed by teflon- coated cable tendons running inside teflon-coated tubes, and pulling against spring returns. Joint angles are measured using custom-designed Hall-effect sensors and the robot can be equipped with torque sensors. The finger tips can be equipped with tactile touch sensors, and a distributed capacitive sensor skin is being developed. The software library is largely written in C++ and uses YARP for external communication via Gigabit Ethernet with off-board software implementing higher level functionality, the development of which has been taken over by the RobotCub Consortium. The robot was not designed for autonomous operation, and is consequently not equipped with onboard batteries or processors required for this --instead an umbilical cable provides power and a network connection. In its final version, the robot has 53 actuated degrees of freedom organized as follows: * 7 in each arm * 9 in each hand (3 for the thumb, 2 for the index, 2 for the middle finger, 1 for the coupled ring and little finger, 1 for the adduction/abduction) * 6 in the head (3 for the neck and 3 for the cameras) * 3 in the torso/waist * 6 in each leg The head has stereo cameras in a swivel mounting where eyes would be located on a human and microphones on the side. It also has lines of red LEDs representing mouth and eyebrows mounted behind the face panel for making facial expressions. Since the first robots were constructed the design has undergone several revisions and improvements, for example smaller and more dexterous hands, and lighter, more robust legs with greater joint angles and which permit walking rather than just crawling.  Capabilities of iCub  Icub at an exhibition in 2014 The iCub has been demonstrated with capabilities to successfully perform the following tasks, among others: * crawling, using visual guidance with optic marker on the floor * solving complex 3D mazes * archery, shooting arrows with a bow and learning to hit the center of the target * facial expressions, allowing the iCub to express emotions * force control, exploiting proximal force/torque sensors * grasping small objects, such as balls, plastic bottles, etc. * collision avoidance within non-static environments, as well as, self-collision avoidance  iCubs in the world  An iCub robot mounted on a supporting frame. These robots were built by Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa and are used by a small but lively community of scientists that use the iCub to study embodied cognition in artificial systems. There are about thirty iCubs in various laboratories mainly in the European Union but also one in the United States. The first researcher in North America to be granted an iCub was Stephen E. Levinson, for studies of computational models of the brain and mind and language acquisition. The robots are constructed by IIT and cost about ‚Ç¨250,000 each depending upon the version. Most of the financial support comes from the European Commission's Unit E5 or the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) via the recently created iCub Facility department. The development and construction of iCub at IIT is part of an independent documentary film called Plug & Pray which was released in 2010.Plug & Pray, documentary film about the social impact of robots and related ethical questions See also * Android * Artificial intelligence * Cyborg * Ibn Sina Robot * Robotics  References   External links  * - Nature article about the iCub. * YouTube Channel - a YouTube channel about the iCub. * iCub presentations - from the Humanoid robotics symposium 2010. * IROS'10 - Videos and workshop on iCub research (2010). * Toward Intelligent Humanoids - Video showing current abilities of the iCub (2012)  Bipedal humanoid robots 2004 robots Science and technology in Europe Open-source robots ","title":"ICub"},{"id":"5746528","text":"Johannes Paul Thilman (11 January 1906 ‚Äì 29 January 1973)Hall, Charles J. (2002) . Taylor & Francis. pp. 642, 1086. . was a German composer.  Life  Thilman, who actually wanted to become a teacher, encountered music at the age of 18 and taught himself initially. After a private lesson with Paul Hindemith and Hermann Scherchen, he attended the Leipzig Conservatory in 1929 and studied Composition with Hermann Grabner. The first performances of his works took place after he finished his studies in 1931. They were performed in Donaueschingen by his teacher, Hindemith. In the year 1940, he became the instructor of composition at the \\"Carl Maria von Weber\\" School of Music in his hometown, Dresden. He was a professor there from the year 1956 until he became an Emeritus professor in 1968. Among his students were composers Friedrich Goldmann and Udo Zimmermann. Besides his academic activities, he was also involved in the music life of Dresden. In 1960, Thilman coveted the National Prize of East Germany.  Style  Thilman was a conservative Composer. His music is tonal and refers to the form and harmony of Romantic music. His melody is always catchy and uncomplicated. Thilman was particularly inspired by folk music. This influence can be heard clearly in many of his works. Most of his works are kept short. Generally, his tone is fresh and uncomplicated rather than dramatic. Undoubtedly, Thilman oriented his works towards the aesthetics of the Socialist realism. In his later works, he often chose unusual settings and freer forms for his works. Thilman was very respected in East Germany. His Symphony no. 4 was particularly popular. Today, however, he is mostly forgotten.

The Erdapfel () is a terrestrial globe produced by Martin Behaim from 1490‚Äì1492. The Erdapfel is the oldest surviving terrestrial globe. It is constructed of a laminated linen ball in two halves, reinforced with wood and overlaid with a map painted by Georg Glockendon. The map was drawn on paper, which was pasted on a layer of parchment around the globe. The Americas are not included, as Columbus returned to Spain no sooner than March 1493.

Cipangu (Japan) is oversized and well south of its true position; Martellus's map is followed in developing an enormous phantom peninsula east of the Golden Chersonese (Malaysia).

Life and career Like a number of the other great writers of the Han dynasty, Yang was from Shu (modern Sichuan province), specifically the area of Pi (modern Pi County, Sichuan). Yang claimed that his family had moved south from the state of Jin during its civil infighting in the 6th century BCE. As a youth Yang was an admirer and imitator of his elder Shu compatriot Sima Xiangru and the \\"grand fu\\" style of the early Han period. His ability and success in fu composition earned him a summons to the imperial capital at Chang'an to serve as an \\"Expectant Official\\", responsible for composing poems and fu for the emperor.Ho (1986): 912. Yang's position required him to praise the virtue and glory of Emperor Cheng of Han and the grandeur of imperial outings, but he was disturbed by the wasteful extravagance of the imperial court. Yang attempted to return the fu genre to a focus of \\"suasive admonition\\" (f√®ng Ë´∑), which he believed was the original purpose of the earliest fu-type writings of Qu Yuan, but his couched admonitions against extravagance went unnoticed and unheeded by Emperor Cheng. Yang's most famous work, Exemplary Sayings (Fa yan Ê≥ïË®Ä) is a philosophical work modeled on the Analects of Confucius (Lunyu), in which Yang criticizes fu writers for focusing on ornate, esoteric language while ignoring more important issues of morality. Yang's other works include Great Mystery (Tai xuan Â§™ÁéÑ), a divination text based on the Classic of Changes (Yijing), \\"Justification Against Ridicule\\" (Jie chao Ëß£Âò≤), one of the best known of the \\"fu of frustration\\" category of fu, and Fangyan, a collection of regional dialectal terms from the various parts of China in his era. Together with Sima Xiangru, Yang was one of the most famous and illustrious men of the entire Han dynasty. The Book of Han devotes a full two-part chapter to both Yang and Sima, an honor surpassing that of even the most famous generals and ministers.Knechtges (1982): 1. Philosophy He did not believe human nature was inherently good as Mencius (fl. 4th century BCE) had written, nor inherently bad as Xunzi (c. 300-230 BCE) had written, but came into existence as a mixture of both. He was a close associate of the official and philosopher Huan Tan (d. 28 CE), an Old Texts realist who may have heavily influenced the works of Wang Chong (27-c. 100 CE). Yang is also known for his protest against the verbosity of the fu. He was hailed by Huan Tan as the \\"Confucius from the western parts\\".

Its primary brand was MyRichUncle. Between 2005 and 2008, MRU Holdings offered students private student loans and federally guaranteed student loans. On September 8, 2008, MRU Holdings ceased offering any student loan products.http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1866589/ On February 9, 2009, MRU Holdings filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and suspended all its operations.https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINBNG20045320090209?rpc=44 History In June 1999, co-founders Raza Khan and Vishal Garg incorporated Iempower Inc. to offer an auction-exchange program for individuals to sell shares in their future income to investors. This model sought to bring equity financing down to the individual level, whereas historically individuals' access to capital meant incurring debt. In Spring 2001, Iempower narrowed its focus to education investments. While meeting with potential capital providers, Khan and Garg saw the concept of education investments as that of having a rich uncle, and thus the brand name MyRichUncle came to be.Footing the Tuition Bill: The New Student Loan Sector, p. 177, Frederick M. Hess, ed. May 2007. Iempower's office was destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. The company's offices were located on the 78th floor of 1 WTC. The company's recovery was profiled by Entrepreneur Magazine \\"Undefeated seasons - challenges met by Ground Zero entrepreneurs following attacks of September 11\\" Entrepreneur, Sept. 2002. Following an attempt to secure greater financing for its equity financing model, Iempower started exploring the traditional student loan market. In 2004, Khan and Garg began to migrate their business model to focus on the traditional private student market. In July 2004, Iempower entered a reverse public merger with Pacific Technologies, a CD manufacturing business. Upon completion of the takeover, Iempower changed its name to MRU Holdings. In February 2005, MRU Holdings obtained a $165 million credit facility from Nomura Securities for funding private student loans, and, in May 2005, MRU Holdings began offering private student loans under the brand name MyRichUncle. MRU Holdings expanded its ability to offer loans, forming a guaranty agency to back loans. In January 2006, MRU Holdings obtained a credit facility with Merrill Lynch Bank USA and also closed a $29 million equity PIPE equity offering from Merrill Lynch Private Equity Partners, Lehman Brothers, and several senior MBNA executives. MRU Holdings introduced its \\"Preprime\\" loans in May 2006. MRU Holdings advertised that its Preprime loan could qualify a student who lacked credit history or a creditworthy co-borrower, for a loan based on student-oriented criteria. MRU Holdings advertised upfront interest rate cuts on federal student loans when they launched their portfolio of federal loan products in June 2006. The company has taken an activist role critical of practices in the student loan industry between financial aid offices and lenders. Since May 2006, MyRichUncle has run its Campaign for Student Loan Reform, informing students and parents to ask questions of the financial aid offices about their relationships with lenders and the construction of preferred lender lists.\\"Financial-Aid Administrators Denounce a Lender's Ad Questioning Their Integrity\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, July 21, 2006.

In the Caribbean, the term generally refers to the sugar cane harvest.*Rojas, Ursino. \\"Life at the Mill\\", pg. 226, in The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics, edited by Aviva Chomsky, Duke University Press, 2004. There, the zafra runs from January through May,(Gorry and Stanley: 141) whereas in the Mediterranean it occurs in September to October. In each case, however, the zafra was closely tied to the life cycle of sugar cane. Because in the Caribbean sugar cane is ready for harvest at a time of year different from in Spain or North Africa, the meaning of the term has shifted. The term became well-known internationally during the 1960s due to its importance in Cuba. Many leftists visited Cuba during the zafra season to help harvest sugar cane, Cuba's principal crop. The Cuban government for several decades made the La Gran Zafra 'The Great Zafra' a centerpiece of both its economic policy and its international relations campaign. Each year, the government urged everyone to help make the zafra the biggest ever. Schools were often closed, and urban residents frequently relocated to the countryside to assist with the harvest. In particular, the goal of reaching the Ten Million Ton Zafra was as much a commonplace of Cuban propaganda as were the apologies and explanations for why the goal was not reached (Pollitt). The national mobilization of the 1970 zafra and its immediate aftermath is the major historical context for the autobiography Dancing with Cuba: A Memoir of the Revolution (2004) by New York Review of Books journalist Alma Guillermoprieto (translated into English by Esther Allen).  Etymology  Linguists agree that the term zafra entered Spanish from Arabic, but there is some disagreement about the precise origins of the term. Some believe it comes from zƒÅfar or zafariya 'harvest time',http://galeon.hispavista.com/toponimosdezafra/epilogo.html while others believe the term derives from sa ºifah 'gathering time'. In Spain, the term referred to harvests that took place in September and October and was especially often used to describe the harvest of sugar cane, a crop whose production was brought from Arab lands.

The technique is executed by holding the edge of the pick against any of the three or four wound strings and moving it along the string. As the pick moves across the string, the edge of the pick catches the string's windings in rapid succession causing the string to vibrate and produce a note. This rapid rattling of the pick's edge against the windings also gives the resulting note a grinding or grating quality. The pitch of a pick slide rises as the pick moves closer to the bridge, and lowers as the pick moves up to the neck. Since pick slides usually start near the bridge and end over the higher frets, these slides have a characteristic of gradually lowering the pitch. A pick slide causes little ‚Äì if any ‚Äì damage to the strings, pickups or guitar, but it does ruin the edge of the pick; thinner picks made of more durable materials are the best choice for the technique.

Plot summary  Calwyn is a young priestess who chants the ice chants of Antaris. She lives inside Antaris, a community located among mountains, which is enclosed by an ice wall. The priestesses must maintain the wall with their chantments; that is, by singing certain songs, the knowledge of which is passed down to them through the temple. Nine powers can be achieved by such songs, though never by the same chanter. Legend has it that a Singer of All Songs will someday be born, who will know and use the songs of all the effects. During one of the nine days of Strengthening, in which the priestesses sing to maintain the Wall, it is breached by a strange traveler, called Darrow. Calwyn attempts to approach him; but when he sings in a low tone, Calwyn feels as though a hand is clutching her tunic and keeping her away. He is unable to maintain this and collapses because of an injury he had suffered, whereupon Calwyn brings Darrow back to the priestess' dwellings. The psychokinetic effect is revealed by the High Priestess to be of a chantment, the Power of Iron, which controls inanimate matter. Calwyn befriends Darrow, who now has a scar on his eyebrow and a permanent limp. Samis, a greedy sorcerer who wants to become the Singer of All Songs and rule the world of Tremaris, follows Darrow to Antaris. Darrow and Calwyn manage to flee by jumping into the river that flows under the Wall. They cross many miles to reach Kalysons, where Darrow meets his friends Tonno and Xanni to ask them for help. All four sail on the boat Fledgewing to Mithates, where they seek the help of a chanter who can help them defeat Samis. In Mithates, the men leave to try finding remnants of the fire chantments, leaving Calwyn on the boat as women are not allowed in the war-machine-making colleges. Calwyn sees Samis' chantment-powered galley dock nearby and searches for her friends to warn them. She, on the way, meets Trout, a bespectacled, inventive college student, who has unknowingly acquired an ancient and powerful object; the Clarion of Flame. This Clarion, a trumpet-like device, is the last remnant of the Chantments of Fire. Samis, using the chantments of Seeming (illusion) to give himself the appearance of Darrow, attempts to seduce Calwyn into giving him the Clarion; Calwyn, because of her soft spot for Darrow, is at first swayed, but eventually realizes the truth. Calwyn and Trout flee from Samis and the Mithate guards; Calwyn uses her chantments to aid their escape. They reach the boat, where they see the real Darrow, Tonno, and Xanni running towards them and away from Samis. Samis uses iron chantment to wield a dagger, threatening to kill Darrow; Xanni takes the blow and dies instead. Everyone, including Trout, escapes from Mithates. The crew gives Xanni's dead body a burial at sea. Later, they all become embittered by his death. Their quest abandoned, the survivors are caught in a storm and are swept into the Great Sea. There they are captured by pirates. Calwyn is taken aboard the pirates' ship because they believe that she is a windworker; a chanter able to control the wind. While aboard, Calwyn befriends the pirates' other windworker, Mica. Mica soon teaches Calwyn how to sing a breeze, thus preventing the pirates from killing her out of hand. Calwyn's ability to sing chantments of both ice and wind convinces Mica that Calwyn's father, who remains unidentified, is an islander, on the grounds that only islanders can sing chantments of wind. The pirates dock at Doryus Town, which is notorious for its slave trade and drug traffic. There, the pirate captain hopes to sell Calwyn to a man who desires a windworker, this man being an incognito Samis. When the pirates have been rendered into a stupor by the effects of a drug called slava, Calwyn, Mica, and the Fledgewing's crew escape. At the same time, Samis tests the Clarion's power on the dormant volcano of the island of Doryus. The volcano erupts, revealing the Clarion's power to summon all forms of fire or heat. The crew of the Fledgewing travel to the arboreal Wildlands with new hope for their quest. While approaching the Wildlands, the protagonists are confronted by the draconic Arakin, who are guardians of that region. Calwyn uses her powers of chantment to make peace with them, revealing that she has a third power of chantment in her composition; the Power of Beasts. This gives Darrow cause for contemplation and worry, in that it implies that Calwyn is the true Singer of All Songs. In the forests of the Wildlands, the sailors are befriended by Halasaa, one of the mute, telepathic Tree People, who is the last guardian of the powers of Becoming; therefore, the power to heal, which is the only one of the Nine Chantments not dependent on audial speech. The Tree People send Halasaa away from their community of Spiridrell as punishment for befriending the outsiders, who have perpetrated genocide against them in the past. He escorts the outsiders, at their request, to the ancient, abandoned city of Spareth, where they meet Samis once more. In the ancient, apparently high-tech city, they enter a tower, where Samis finds them again. In a final confrontation, Samis tricks and then terrorizes the crew of Fledgewing into singing the different chantments, claiming that he who commands the Nine Powers to be sung will become the Singer of all Songs. When Darrow's life is threatened, a despairing Calwyn sings the last chantment, a song of ice-call. Instead of transforming Samis into a god, the Great Power he has summoned absorbs and overwhelms him. The crew are left to ponder how to realize Samis‚Äô vision for a peaceful and united Tremaris without tyranny: not as one lone voice, as he wanted, but as many voices singing together.  Characters  Calwyn is a 16-year-old priestess of Antaris who can sing ice chantments. Tends to the bee hives and is skilled with medicines and herbs; apparently very skilled in singing chantments, for she is capable of calling ice, working wind, and placating animals with her songs. She yearns to travel beyond the ice wall of Antaris and does so when Darrow comes and takes her on a journey. Calwyn is adventurous, restless, and faithful to a fault; at times she may not see others' points of view and insists that she is right. Calwyn strives to prove her worth, and is upset when unable to do so. Calwyn takes after her mother, who too longed for whatever lay beyond the Wall. Is described as being tall and skinny with big black eyes and long black hair in one or two plaits down her back. Darrow is a traveler who is trying to escape Samis (see next character), who is trying to kill him. Calwyn saves Darrow when he injures himself as he flies, by means of his own magic, over the Wall but fell to the ground from the top. When Calwyn helps him escape Antaris, she goes with him to stop Samis. An ironcrafter of Merithuros who was once friends with Samis but now aims to stop him. Calwyn calls him an old man whose life is almost over; he is mentally tired but enjoys traveling. He has traveled very far and Calwyn often asks him to tell her stories of his travels. Described as lean, light, hay compared, haired, hawk-eyed, having a crescent shaped scar over his right eye, and nearing his 30s. Has a limp from his fall over the Wall, but is later healed by Halasaa. Samis an evil and greedy sorcerer who is trying to become The Singer of All Songs. In this position, he would be capable of manipulating wind, metal, wood, earth and ice, and communicating with animals not of his own race; as well as able to psychokinetically heal wounds, generate illusions, and produce fire. Was a minor prince of the Merithuran Empire who sought to be emperor, but was unable to earn him the title. Rejected, Samis instead sought to be ruler of all Tremaris. Wears a square iron ring jeweled with a ruby. Described as tall with a head too big for his frame; an ugly face looking like it was carved from stone; a beaked nose; a long mouth; and a mane of gray hair from a high brow. Mica a 14- to 15-year- old windworker (a magician capable of controlling movement of wind). Works for pirates, but escapes with Calwyn on the boat Fledgewing. Her village was burned down by slavers, whereupon Mica was captured and sold to a pirate crew. Mica gives the impression of bravado so as to avoid seeming weak. Described as being skinny with tawny skin, pale hair, and golden eyes. Wears a faded jacket that once belonged to Mica's beloved grandmother. Tonno the brother of Xanni. Darrow's friend. Unable to sing chantments himself. Prizes himself as the ship's cook. Described as tall and burly with bushy eyebrows, curly hair, dark eyes, and a sullen, serious look. Xanni is the owner of Fledgewing and Tonno's younger brother, about one to two years younger than Darrow. A good natured, adventurous young man. He is mortally wounded in Mithates by Samis and later dies at sea. Described as short with curly hair, dark, bright eyes, and wrinkles formed from laughing on his face. Trout a young inventor from Mithates who possesses, without knowledge of its use, the Clarion of the Flame. He joins Calwyn and her friends in Mithates. Trout wears glasses. He was involved in an explosion due to an invention of his that ruined his hearing; Trout is now unable to hear high-pitched sounds, and thus is unaffected by the chantments of illusion, which are highly pitched. Described as being freckled with vague, blue eyes, has numerous burn scars and scratches. Trout is initially skeptical of chantments, but is ultimately convinced of their reality. Halasaa one of the telepathic, voiceless Tree People, and the last user of the power of Becoming, which is a healing power activated by certain gestures. Calwyn meets him in the Wildlands, after an encounter with the dragonlike arakin. Halasaa is rejected by his people for his gift, as well as for his acceptance of voiced people, but is still kind and hopeful. Because Calwyn is a magic-user, like himself, he calls her \\"sister\\". But the Tree People would still ask him to heal the ones that they couldn't. So they acknowledged his existence but didn't accept him. Marna is the High Priestess of Antaris. Described as old with silver hair piled on her head and carrying a staff of her office. She is a tired and wise woman. Tamen is the Guardian of the Wall. Stern and awe inspiring, Tamen seems to purposefully ridicule Calwyn. Marna says this is only because Calwyn may one day be High Priestess, meaning that Tamen and Calwyn would have to work together. Described as tall with a long black and silver braid down her back. She fears that Calwyn perhaps is even more powerful than her. Calida was Calwyn's mother. Restless like her daughter, she too sought to leave Antaris and explore the Outlands. Mysteriously, she vanished one day, only a little older than Calwyn. Many years later, Calida appeared during winter with baby Calwyn in her arms and died that night. Ursca is the dumpy infirmarian of the priestess's dwellings. She tends to panic at every mistake, but when left to take care of a patient she is calm and in control. Ursca taught Calwyn everything she knows of herbs and medicines, but nearly drove Calwyn to madness with her fidgety ways and her tendency to, having acquired an opinion, hold onto it despite all evidence to the contrary. Gilly is a novice ice priestess who is a friend to Calwyn. At the beginning of the book she begins her first Day of Strengthening. She is described as frivolous and prone to premature flirting with boys. She is only mentioned a couple times in the beginning. Tuw a gardener of the priestess's dwellings. He was born with a crooked foot and the other leg a hand span shorter than the other. Tuw has therefore fashioned a shoe with an exceptionally thick sole and many walking sticks, one which ends up in Darrow's possession. =Reception= The Kirkus reviews said \\"the actual workings of enchantment, definitions of the powers, various characters' emotions are well sketched,\\" however, it added, the novel \\"lack[s] depth.\\" It is \\"not meaty, but creative,\\" the reviewer hedged. \\"Calwyn,\\" Kirkus added, is \\"a fairly passive protagonist.\\" Publishers Weekly complained that \\"the sheer level of detail is overwhelming at first.\\" The review adding, however, that \\"those who press on through the overwhelming detail will find their efforts rewarded.\\" The review praised \\"Constable for imagining a rich satisfying universe.\\" References External links * http://www.kateconstable.com/synopsis1.html 2002 Australian novels Australian fantasy novels ","title":"The Singer of All Songs"},{"id":"5746636","text":"Saint Paula of Rome (AD 347‚Äì404) was an ancient Roman saint and early Desert Mother. A member of one of the richest senatorial families which claimed descent from Agamemnon, Paula was the daughter of Blesilla and Rogatus, from the great clan of the Furii Camilli. At the age of 16https://www.lentmadness.org/2019/03/paula-of-rome-vs-marcella-of- rome/http://ww1.antiochian.org/node/17350, Paula was married to the nobleman Toxotius, with whom she had four daughters, Blaesilla, Paulina, Eustochium, and Rufina. She also had a boy, also named Toxotius. Life Information about Paula's early life is recorded by Saint Jerome. In his Letter 108, he states that she had led a luxurious life and held a great status. She dressed in silks, and had been carried about the city by her eunuch slaves. Entering the religious life At the age of 32, Paula was widowed. She continued to dedicate herself to her family, but became more interested in religion as time went on. Through the influence of Saint Marcella and her group, Paula became an enthusiastic member of this semi-monastic group of women. In 382, she met Saint Jerome, who had come to Rome with Saint Epiphanius and Bishop Paulinus of Antioch. Born in Dalmatia, Jerome had studied in Rome as a youth and had traveled to Germany and Aquileia, and for some years had lived in the East as an ascetic and scholar. While on pilgrimage to the Holy Land and Egypt, she settled in Bethlehem and established a monastery for men and a convent for women.David Farmer, ed., Oxford Dictionary of Saints, , p. 416. Saint Paula's family Paula married her daughter, Paulina (d. 395), to the senator Saint Pammachius; Blesilla soon became a widow and died in 384. Of her two other daughters, Rufina died in 386, and Eustochium accompanied her mother to the Orient where she died in 419. Her son, Toxotius, at first not a Christian, but baptized in 385, married in 389 Laeta, daughter of the pagan priest Albinus. Of this marriage was born Paula the Younger, who in 404 rejoined Eustochium in the Holy Land and in 420 closed the eyes of St. Jerome. These are the names which recur frequently in the letters of St. Jerome, where they are inseparable from that of Paula. It has been argued that Saint Eustochius of Tours was the brother of Paula the Younger and the son of Toxotius.T. S. M. Mommaerts & D. H. Kelley, The Anicii of Gaul and Rome, in Fifth-century Gaul: a Crisis of Identity?, ed. by John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge & New York, 1992) Pages 120-121.  Paula's Pilgrimage  A year after the death of her husband, Paula pursued a pilgrimage to tour all of the holy sights, traveling with large entourages of both men and women including her daughter Eustochium and Jerome himself. Paula could undertake this voyage due to her widow status which left her a significant fortune allowing her exemption from remarriage. Additionally, having had a male heir and two married daughters provided supplementary financial insurance. Her travels are documented by Jerome in his later writing addressed to Eustochium which discusses how Paula participated in the environments they toured. He discusses that Paula exemplified an intimate and emotional connection with the sights, experiencing visual vividness of biblical events at each locale. Concluding her journey, Paula decided to remain in Bethlehem to develop a monastery and spiritual retreat with Jerome.  Monastery Establishment  Once settled in Bethlehem, Paula and Jerome built a double monastery including one for Paula and her nuns and another for Jerome and his monks. The addition of a roadside hostel was also constructed to serve as an economic source to fund the monasteries. This development took three years to complete and was primarily sourced by Paula who, during this time of construction, stayed at another double monastery called Mount Olives. Once completed, the monastery segregated each gender from one another during manual labor and meals, but practiced prayer in the same locale. Additional separation, within the nun monastery, included three different communities of women based on social rank who were divided in separate living quarters. During its functioning, Jerome and Paula's retreat attracted large crowds of visitors both from Christian backgrounds and general travelers from a variety of regions including Ethiopia, Persia, and India. Along with this, aristocratic refugees were also drawn to the locale due to Jerome's extensive network of followers. The result of this inclusion, alongside their growing admittance of monks and nuns, left Paula and Jerome's retreat to face financial hardship, having their resources strained. In order to recover costs, which were also depleted by Paula's considerable donations to the needy, Jerome sold his family's property in Italy and Dalmatia.  Paula's Ascetic Life  It is Jerome's writing's in a letter to Eustochium that provide the most insight on Paula's life during her years of service at the monastery. She is noted as maintaining her ascetic devotion through intensive studies of the Old and New Testaments, often under the guidance of Jerome. With this, she also practiced a strict fasting regimen, abstinence, and pursued a destitute lifestyle ‚Äúto preserve a singular attachment to God‚Äù as stated by Jerome. While practicing this life of isolation, Paula still continued to interact with local clergy and bishops and maintained devout attention to teaching the nuns under her sovereignty. Jerome's letter from 404 moreover indicates Saint Paula's first-hand connection with relics from Christ's passion, \\"she was shown the pillar of the church which supports the colonnade and is stained with the Lord's blood. He is said to have been tied to it when he was scourged.\\" Jerome made explicit in his letter how Paula, through these practices, became a recognized figure in the Christian community. At one point, in traveling to Nitria, she was earnestly received by renowned monks from Egypt, and once her death arrived on 26 January 404, her funeral was noted as having a significant portion of the Palestine population arrive in her honor. A year after her passing, Paula was recognized by the Latin Church as a saint, with feast day on 26 January. Relationship with Saint Jerome alt= Jerome's enemies found that his denunciations of clerical indulgence and advocacy of self-denial were odd when they considered his close relationship with Paula.The Ecole Initiative: Jerome An amorous relationship between Jerome and Paula was suggested as having occurred. Paula helped Jerome in his translation of the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. The work was done at her suggestion, and she provided the reference works necessary for the undertaking. Being versed in Hebrew, she edited Jerome's manuscripts. She and her daughter Eustochium copied the work for circulation.Ellen Battelle Dietrick in The Woman's Bible, Volume II, page 137. An anecdote told of Jerome, of twelfth-century origin, tells that Roman clergy hostile to Jerome planned to have him expelled from the city by planting a woman's robe next to his bed. When Jerome awoke in the middle of the night to attend the service of matins, he absentmindedly put on the female robes. He was thus accused of having had a woman in his bed. This story acknowledges, while at the same time discrediting as a malicious slander, Jerome's relationship with women, such as he is presumed to have had with Paula. Chaucer played upon the relationship between Jerome and Paula when he writes the Wife of Bath's Prologue. Chaucer has the Wife visit the same pilgrimage sites as did Paula, and has her constantly cite not classical authors, but Jerome. Many of her comments are counter-arguments to those put forth by St. Jerome, mainly in his work Against Jovinianus.

A narrowly divided court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child pornography through the mail, ruling that postal inspectors had implanted a desire to do so through repeated written entreaties. It was the first time the court had considered an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.Lord, Kenneth; Entrapment and Due Process: Moving Toward A Dual System of Defenses , 25 Fl St. U.

This draft is described as a chapter in the forthcoming Criminal Law Stories. 31. Background of the case =US anti-child pornography legislation and early cases= Until the late 1970s, there were no federal laws specifically addressing the production, distribution or possession of child pornography, and it was readily available to those who sought it. While some was imported from European countries where it was produced, there was also a domestic industry. Media expos√©s and popular outrage led Congress to pass by unanimous vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production and sale of child pornography. This act was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. also amended the Mann Act The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance. Shortly thereafter, an update to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made it illegal to purchase pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, on the grounds that it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.Lawrence Stanley, The Child Pornography Myth, 7 Cardozo Arts & Ent L J 295, 324 (1989); cited at Chin, 18n54. =Investigation and arrest of Keith Jacobson= In January 1985 inspectors for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the Great Plains states began \\"Project Looking Glass\\", a sting operation under the newly enacted Child Protection Act of 1984,Pub.L. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204 (1984). which made it illegal to send pictures of nude minors through the mail, even for noncommercial purposes (previously, only those who intended to resell them could be prosecuted).Linder, Doug; Evil in the American Justice System; Case 3: Project Looking Glass, retrieved August 10, 2006. Ray Mack, the inspector in charge, meant it to be primarily an intelligence-gathering operation, a way to keep tabs on producers and distributors. It sent mail to those it had known to have ordered such materials while they were legal. Among them were Keith Jacobson, a bachelor 56-year-old U.S. Army retiree turned farmer living with his elderly parents in Newman Grove, Nebraska, who would later describe himself as bisexualMarcus, Ruth; November 6, 1991; Fair Sting or Foul Trap? Child Pornography Investigation Challenged; The Washington Post; retrieved August 13, 2006 although he said he had never had relations with men.Chin, Id., 9. Jacobson had, the previous year, ordered two magazines entitled Bare Boys I and Bare Boys II from Electric Moon, an adult bookstore in San Diego, California, that had been raided and shut down. USPS investigators decided to send him a letter from a fictitious organization, the \\"American Hedonist Society\\", which supposedly sought to lobby for \\"the right to read what we desire, the right to discuss similar interests with those who share our philosophy, and finally that we have the right to seek pleasure without restrictions being placed on us by outdated puritan morality.\\" Included was a questionnaire attempting to gauge the respondent's interest in various paraphilias, including pedophilia and ephebophilia. Jacobson indicated an \\"above average\\" interest in the latter, especially between males, but also stated he was opposed to the former. The USPS decided he was not a promising target and left him alone. But some time later, Calvin Comfort, a \\"prohibited mailing specialist\\" for the region, found Jacobson's name in another file, and the government decided to try again, this time as part of an operation aimed at purchasers. In May 1986, they sent him mail from another fictitious organization, \\"Midlands Data Research\\", which was for those who \\"believe in the joys of sex and the complete awareness of those lusty and youthful lads and lasses of the neophite age\\". Jacobson confessed to them that he was \\"interested in teenage sexuality\\", asked for more information and that his name be kept confidential. This led to Jacobson getting mail from the \\"Heartland Institute for a New Tomorrow\\" (HINT), \\"an organization founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice. We believe that arbitrarily imposed legislative sanctions restricting your sexual freedom should be rescinded through the legislative process.\\" Jacobson seemed to sympathize, writing in response that sexual freedom and freedom of the press were under attack by \\"right-wing fundamentalists\\". Along with a thank you note from \\"Jean Daniels\\" of HINT also came a supposed list of others in the area with similar interests as possible pen pals. But Jacobson never wrote to any of them. So Comfort, under the pseudonym \\"Carl Long\\", wrote back using a technique called \\"mirroring\\", claiming to have interests calculated to be similar to those believed held by Jacobson, and specifically, to be equally interested in depictions of sex acts between young boys. Jacobson said he, too, liked \\"good looking young guys (in their late teens and early 20s) doing their thing together\\". Neither Jacobson nor Comfort made any more explicit reference to pornographic materials and Jacobson stopped writing back after two letters. With no evidence that he had ever watched or possessed any child pornography, the USPS again dropped its efforts against him. Those were renewed in March 1987 when the United States Customs Service sent similar exploratory material, supposedly from Canada, to Jacobson and others on the USPS's list, and he responded, placing an order that was never filled. A catalog from a \\"Far Eastern Trading Company\\" was sent instead, along with other written material bemoaning the infringement of sexual freedoms. This time Jacobson ordered a publication called Boys Who Love Boys, which the catalog said featured \\"11 and 14 year old boys\\" who \\"get it on in every way imaginable. Oral, anal and heavy masturbation. If you love boys,\\" it further read, \\"you will be delighted with this\\". On June 16, 1987, Jacobson received a card in his mail telling him to go to the post office and pick up the envelope that supposedly contained Boys Who Love Boys. Comfort observed him doing so and got a search warrant for his home on that basis. He was arrested shortly thereafter, 26 months after the postal inspectors had first contacted him.Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 544‚Äì547 Lower court proceedings =Criminal trial= Jacobson was indicted on one count of knowingly receiving through the mails sexually explicit material depicting a minor18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2252(a)(2) in September. At trial in federal court, his attorney, George H. Moyer, noted his exemplary military service record, including a Bronze Star, service in Korea and Vietnam War and lack of a civilian criminal record beyond a drunken-driving conviction in 1958.Chin, Id., 13. He raised the entrapment defense. Jacobson testified that he had been \\"shocked and surprised\\" by the contents of the Bare Boys collections when he received them, as he had not expected the photos to depict very young boys: \\"I thought these were a nudist type publication. Many of the pictures were out in a rural or outdoor setting. There was ‚Äì I didn't draw any sexual connotation or connection with that\\".Jacobson, 503 U.S. 540, 543 The jury convicted him in April 1988. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended to two years' probation and 250 hours of community service, which he discharged by painting a school bus and working at a library. He had to sell his share of the family farm to his sister to pay his legal bills, and was fired from his job driving a school bus in Newman Grove even though there was no evidence he had ever approached children sexually.Chin, Id., 12, He lowered his profile, often driving to more distant communities to run routine errands.Johnson, Dirk; April 19, 1992; Farmer Caught in Pornography Trap Feels Vindicated, but at a Cruel Cost; The New York Times; retrieved August 11, 2006. Nonetheless, his hometown supported him. \\"Any of us could be caught up in such a sting,\\" the Newman Grove local newspaper editorialized. =Appeals= A panel of three appellate judges heard the case for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 12, 1990, Senior Judge Gerald Heaney and Chief Judge Donald Lay overturned the conviction on the grounds that the government had insufficient grounds to believe that Jacobson was likely to purchase the material it was offering to him.United States v. Jacobson, 893 F2d at 999‚Äì1000. Judge George G. Fagg said in dissent that his colleagues had \\"declared war on the government's power to initiate undercover investigations\\" and that reasonable suspicion need not be present for such operations to take place.Id. at 1003. He would carry the day after federal prosecutors appealed for an en banc rehearing by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) to do so in any way.United States v. Jacobson, 916 F2d 467 (8th Cir. 1990) (en banc) Lay and Heaney were the sole dissenters, and wrote separate opinions based upon two different grounds. The former argued that Jacobson had not in fact shown \\"predisposition\\" toward breaking the law throughout his life, since the only known prior purchases and basis for belief by prosecutors, were purchases he had made at a time this was a legal act; Lay therefore concluded that without evidence of prior disposition to break the law in this way, he had been entrapped. The latter's dissent was similar to the original panel opinion, arguing that the government had no reasonable belief that Jacobson would purchase child pornography. He also called investigative tactics sufficiently outrageous to justify reversal: \\"In my view, the government's investigation and prosecution of Jacobson amount to the deliberate manufacture of a crime that would never have occurred but for the Postal Service's overzealous efforts to create it\\".Jacobson, Id., at 476 Supreme Court case =Certiorari petition= John Paul Stevens, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court supposedly picked Jacobson's case out of a pile of \\"hopeless\\" certiorari petitions. After reading it, Justice Byron White made an argument moving and persuasive enough that Justices Harry Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall, and Stevens changed their minds and agreed to accept it. Regardless of how certiorari was granted, arguments before the Court were limited by the grant to the single issue in question, of whether as a matter of law, Jacobson had been entrapped.Murdoch, Joyce and Pryce, Deb; Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. the Supreme Court; Basic Books 2001, , 410, cited in Chin. =Entrapment in federal prosecutions= The entrapment defense at the federal level exists entirely in case law. Federal courts first recognized entrapment in Woo Wai v. United States, 223 F 412 (9th Circuit 1915), and the Supreme Court followed suit in Sorrells v. United States, . The Sorrells court grounded the entrapment defense in what has since been called the \\"subjective\\" test, in which the prosecution must overcome it by showing the defendant had a \\"predisposition\\" to commit the crime in any event.Chin, Id., 3. In Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369 (1958), Felix Frankfurter, in a concurrence, had argued instead for an \\"objective\\" standard, which focuses instead on the conduct of the law enforcement personnel involved and whether the crime would have occurred without their involvement,Sherman v. United States, (Frankfurter, J., concurring) a call repeated by other justices in later decisions. While the majority of states have chosen to use the objective method, the Supreme Court has held firm to the former.Scott C. Paton, \\"The Government Made Me Do It\\": A Proposed Approach to Entrapment Under Jacobson v. United States, 79 Cornell L. Rev. 995, 1002 n.45 (1994) =Briefings and pre- hearing public awareness= Jacobson's case attracted some national media attention. Civil liberties advocates including the ACLU supported him, worried over what they saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution at the behest of the Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst,App. Reply Brief at 11 & n.5, citing Lawrence Stanley, The Child Pornography Myth, 7 Cardozo Arts & Ent L J 295, 324 (1989) possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.Amy Adler, The Perverse Law of Child Pornography, 101 Colum L Rev 209, 212 (2001); cited at Chin, 21n77 It was the subject of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he wanted to see just what it was that he was being so heavily solicited to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.CBS News; February 16, 1992; \\"The Sting\\"; 60 Minutes. Interested parties on both sides filed amici. A group of conservative Republicans in both houses of Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.Chin, Id., 20 =Arguments= Moyer, who had never argued before the Supreme Court, continued to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise to a level of proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.Starr, Kenneth; March 1991; Brief For The United States In Opposition; United States Department of Justice; retrieved August 11, 2006.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives. During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia responded to this by suggesting that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms regardless of whether the conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.Chin, Id., 22 =Decision= By a 5‚Äì4 margin, the justices reversed the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It has since been reported that this was one of the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7‚Äì2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.Chin, Id., 23n64 Justice David Souter later provided the swing vote, and opinions that White and Sandra Day O'Connor had already begun drafting had to be rewritten to reflect the changed outcome of the case.Hutchinson, Dennis J.; The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White, , 420 (The Free Press 1998), cited by Murdoch & Pryce and in turn by Chin. Majority White, reiterating what he had written in Ferber, acknowledged that child pornography was a social evil and that the government could use undercover investigations to enforce laws against it. After reviewing the previous cases on entrapment, he said that the more than two years in which investigators had tried to get Jacobson to buy various child-porn offerings had suggested he did not have a predisposition to do so: \\"... (I)t is our view that the Government did not prove that this predisposition was independent, and not the product of the attention that the Government had directed at petitioner since January, 1985\\".Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 550. Since the Bare Boys purchases were legal at the time, they did not prove that he was willing to break the law to acquire such materials. \\"... (E)vidence that merely indicates a generic inclination to act within a broad range, not all of which is criminal, is of little probative value in establishing predisposition\\", he wrote. \\"Evidence of predisposition to do what once was lawful is not, by itself, sufficient to show predisposition to do what is now illegal, for there is a common understanding that most people obey the law even when they disapprove of it\\".Jacobson, Id., at 551. He also noted that, at trial, the prosecution had not challenged Jacobson's assertion that he did not know the magazines would contain pictures of minors until he received it. Furthermore, he suggested, the appeals to political action he received may have given him reasons other than prurient interest to order the material, indeed even suggested he had a duty to order them as a way of taking a stand: > ... (T)he strong arguable inference is that, by waving the banner of > individual rights and disparaging the legitimacy and constitutionality of > efforts to restrict the availability of sexually explicit materials, the > Government not only excited petitioner's interest in sexually explicit > materials banned by law, but also exerted substantial pressure on petitioner > to obtain and read such material as part of a fight against censorship and > the infringement of individual rights ... The evidence that petitioner was > ready and willing to commit the offense came only after the Government had > devoted 2¬Ω years to convincing him that he had or should have the right to > engage in the very behavior proscribed by law.Jacobson, Id., at 552 White also dismissed the notion that his responses to the surveys he was sent proved he was willing to order child porn illegally, saying they only indicated \\"a predisposition to view photographs of preteen sex and a willingness to promote a given agenda by supporting lobbying organizations ... petitioner's responses hardly support an inference that he would commit the crime of receiving child pornography through the mails\\". He noted that twice beforeStanley v. Georgia, ; Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, the Court had suggested that an individual's private fantasies are not the government's business, even if it has a strong interest in proscribing the enactment of those fantasies. \\"When the Government's quest for convictions\\", he concluded, \\"leads to the apprehension of an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely would have never run afoul of the law, the courts should intervene.\\"Jacobson, Id., 554. Dissent O'Connor made two arguments for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven by the fact that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case. She began by stating what was, to the minority, the most relevant aspect of the case. > Keith Jacobson was offered only two opportunities to buy child pornography > through the mail. Both times, he ordered. Both times, he asked for > opportunities to buy more. He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, > or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or suggested > that his committing the crime would further a greater good. In fact, no > Government agent even contacted him face to face.Jacobson, Id., at 554, > O'Connor, J., dissenting She noted also that Jacobson had written, in a note included with his order, that he would be doing more business with the company later and that he wanted to \\"(b)e discreet in order to protect you and me\\". The majority, she said, had so greatly expanded the government's burden of proof in undercover sting operations as to make future such investigations untenable: > ... (A)fter this case, every defendant will claim that something the > Government agent did before soliciting the crime \\"created\\" a predisposition > that was not there before. For example, a bribetaker will claim that the > description of the amount of money available was so enticing that it > implanted a disposition to accept the bribe later offered. A drug buyer will > claim that the description of the drug's purity and effects was so tempting > that it created the urge to try it for the first time. In short, the Court's > opinion could be read to prohibit the Government from advertising the > seductions of criminal activity as part of its sting operation, for fear of > creating a predisposition in its suspects.Jacobson, Id., at 557, O'Connor, > J., dissenting. She scoffed at White's claim that the calls to activism were possibly instrumental in creating a predisposition to offend: \\"The most one finds is letters advocating legislative action to liberalize obscenity laws, letters which could easily be ignored or thrown away ... Nor did the Government claim to be organizing a civil disobedience movement, which would protest the pornography laws by breaking them.\\" It was up to the jury, she said, to decide what Jacobson meant when he said on the stand that he wanted to see \\"what all the trouble and hysteria was about\\",Jacobson, Id., at 558‚Äì9, O'Connor, J., dissenting. and they had done so. In Part II, she accused her colleagues of redefining predisposition so that it had to include an awareness that the action to be undertaken was illegal, despite the fact that the CPA did not include specific intent to receive child pornography as an element of the crime. \\"The elements of predisposition,\\" she said, \\"should track the elements of the crime\\".Jacobson, Id., at 560, O'Connor, J., dissenting. The Bare Boys purchases were not, she argued, as dispositive of that as the majority claimed. Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that there was no question that the jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand. Aftermath =Reaction= New York Times' reporter Linda Greenhouse described the initial verdict as \\"an anomaly, an extreme misuse of Government power in which an innocent person was led to commit a manufactured crime\\" and thus not likely to signal a shift back in favor of defendants after a period that had seen a move away from the liberalism of the Warren and Burger Courts towards a more law-and-order‚Äìoriented Court.

Civil liberties advocates savored what they felt was an overdue triumph against the overreach of law enforcement during the preceding decade. \\"... (W)hen the State gets behind a moral panic, no one is safe,\\" wrote Bob Chatelle of the political issues committee of the National Writers' Union, pointing to other zealous prosecutions of people with no demonstrable interest in child pornography who had nevertheless fallen afoul of newer laws by taking or possessing pictures of naked children with no apparent sexual content.Chatelle, Bob; 1993; Kiddie Porn Panic ; newsletter of the Political Issues Committee of the American Writers' Union; retrieved August 13, 2006. Others pointed to what they called the horrific cost of Project Looking Glass. Among its other targets had been another middle-aged Nebraska farmer, Bob Brase, of Shelby. Like Jacobson, his name had been on the mailing list of a porn distributor, and despite neither having a criminal record nor any interest in child porn he was relentlessly solicited, including letters from the same \\"Carl Long\\". Finally he ordered a videotape and was arrested and indicted. No other prohibited material was found in his house, either. Just before he was to be arraigned, he drove into a field and shot himself, leaving behind a wife and two children. His was one of four suicides by Looking Glass targets. Critics wondered if these suicides, which investigators had said they expected, were worth it. In 1999, Comfort also took his own life, citing despondency over the stresses of his job.Associated Press; Apr 2 1999; \\"Milwaukee Postal Inspector Found Dead In His Parked Van\\"; cited in Chin, 12. =Legacy= Jacobson, opined Paul Marcus, a law professor at William & Mary three years later, \\"brought entrapment back from the (almost) dead.\\" He noted that in its wake, courts were much more willing to allow, and sometimes agree with, entrapment defenses than they had been beforehand. Influential sitting judge Richard Posner had used similar language a year before, writing in an opinion that it had \\"breathed new life\\" into the defense. Most significantly, he said, appeals courts were now considering it in cases where the defendant had seemed willing to commit the crime, examining predisposition closely in cases where they would have previously rejected it out of hand.United States v Hollingsworth, 27 F3d 1196, 1198 (7th Cir 1994) (en banc). Despite vows by prosecutors and heads of federal law enforcement agencies that the decision would not change the way they did undercover operations, there were some noticeable, at least at the federal level. Later versions of the Attorney General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations, widely emulated by other federal agencies, show some changes in language from those published before Jacobson. \\"Entrapment should be avoided\\", became \\"entrapment must be avoided\\", and investigators were told it must be apparent to them that the activity they were investigating was illegal, rather than just corrupt. A definition of entrapment was included that used the same language as the decision. Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce say another effect of the case was a softening of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, and even a few years earlier his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.Murdoch & Pryce, Id., 406. Cited in Chin. =Subsequent lower-court jurisprudence= Jacobson remains the Court's current standard on the issue as it has not considered an entrapment case since. Similar sting operations continue to be widely used against all types of targets and in new ways. Most significantly, the rise of the Internet has led to operations where investigators pose as minors of either sex in chat rooms, trying to entice online predators to come meet them in person and have sex. When they do, they are arrested. These operations have become popular viewing on Dateline NBC's \\"To Catch A Predator\\" segments and other television shows. Most such operations are over very quickly and result in guilty pleas, but entrapment is sometimes alleged, and a protracted investigation of a Florida man led to the first Internet entrapment case to be considered at the appellate level. Writing for a Ninth Circuit majority (the arrest occurred in California) in Poehlman v United States, 217 F3d 692 (9th Cir 2000), Judge Alex Kozinski reversed the conviction, saying the defendant had met the Jacobson standard and shown that the idea of crossing state lines to have sex with a minor had been implanted only after extensive email correspondence with an undercover FBI agent.Chin, Id., 32n95. In 2014 a case resulting from a sting operation was ruled by a Federal court to have been \\"cut from whole cloth\\" by ATF operatives and to have constituted as entrapment by the ATF; the case was thrown out. =Other analysis and commentary= Kenneth Lord notes that the decision did not address the subjective vs. objective test question at all. He observes that the decision adds two new strictures as part of its general rule that prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime prior to any contact by government agents: * Conduct by the defendant which was legal at the time but later made illegal does not suffice to prove predisposition, and * The defendant's predisposition must be evaluated based on his or her conduct prior to the commencement of any investigation.Id. 463, 476 and 479. But beyond that, it makes no effort to address the subjective vs. objective question, nor does its discussion of intent delve into the matter of specific vs. general intent. Some appeals courts, however, have developed more specific entrapment tests on their own.Id., 477-78. University of Arizona law professor Gabriel J. Chin points out that the entire federal entrapment defense rests on statutory construction, which allows for the possibility that Congress could simply repeal or modify it so that operations implanting suggestion of criminal activity such as the one that ensnared Jacobson were specifically authorized by law. Since the majority had shown such distaste for it, how, he wondered, would it rule on the constitutionality of such a law if it were to be challenged?Chin, Id., 33.

Its activation is necessary for the hormonal functioning of FSH. FSHRs are found in the ovary, testis, and uterus.  FSHR gene  The gene for the FSHR is found on chromosome 2 p21 in humans. The gene sequence of the FSHR consists of about 2,080 nucleotides.  Receptor structure  The seven transmembrane Œ±-helix structure of a G protein-coupled receptor such as FSHR The FSHR consists of 695 amino acids and has a molecular mass of about 76 kDa. Like other GPCRs, the FSH-receptor possesses seven membrane-spanning domains or transmembrane helices. * The extracellular domain of the receptor contains 11 leucine-rich repeats and is glycosylated. It has two subdomains, a hormone-binding subdomain followed by a signal-specificity subdomain. The hormone-binding subdomain is responsible for the high-affinity hormone binding, and the signal-specificity subdomain, containing a sulfated tyrosine at position 335 (sTyr) in a hinge loop, is required for the hormone activity. * The transmembrane domain contains two highly conserved cysteine residues that build disulfide bonds to stabilize the receptor structure. A highly conserved Asp-Arg-Tyr triplet motif is present in GPCR family members in general and may be of importance to transmit the signal. In FSHR and its closely related other glycoprotein hormone receptor members (LHR and TSHR), this conserved triplet motif is a variation Glu-Arg-Trp sequence. * The C-terminal domain is intracellular and brief, rich in serine and threonine residues for possible phosphorylation.  Ligand binding and signal transduction  Upon initial binding to the LRR region of FSHR, FSH reshapes its conformation to form a new pocket. FSHR then inserts its sulfotyrosine from the hinge loop into the pockets and activates the 7-helical transmembrane domain. This event leads to a transduction of the signal that activates the G protein that is bound to the receptor internally. With FSH attached, the receptor shifts conformation and, thus, mechanically activates the G protein, which detaches from the receptor and activates the cAMP system. It is believed that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states. The binding of FSH to the receptor shifts the equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. FSH and FSH-agonists shift the equilibrium in favor of active states; FSH antagonists shift the equilibrium in favor of inactive states. For a cell to respond to FSH, only a small percentage (~1%) of receptor sites need to be activated. = Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases = Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are activated by the signal chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the FSH-receptor) via adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP). These protein kinases are present as tetramers with two regulatory units and two catalytic units. Upon binding of cAMP to the regulatory units, the catalytic units are released and initiate the phosphorylation of proteins, leading to the physiologic action. The cyclic AMP-regulatory dimers are degraded by phosphodiesterase and release 5‚ÄôAMP. DNA in the cell nucleus binds to phosphorylated proteins through the cyclic AMP response element (CRE), which results in the activation of genes. The signal is amplified by the involvement of cAMP and the resulting phosphorylation. The process is modified by prostaglandins. Other cellular regulators are participate are the intracellular calcium concentration modified by phospholipase, nitric acid, and other growth factors. The FSH receptor can also activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). In a feedback mechanism, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active, the more kinases are activated, the more receptors are phosphorylated.  Action  In the ovary, the FSH receptor is necessary for follicular development and expressed on the granulosa cells. In the male, the FSH receptor has been identified on the Sertoli cells that are critical for spermatogenesis. The FSHR is expressed during the luteal phase in the secretory endometrium of the uterus. FSH receptor is selectively expressed on the surface of the blood vessels of a wide range of carcinogenic tumors.  Receptor regulation  = Upregulation = Upregulation refers to the increase in the number of receptor sites on the membrane. Estrogen upregulates FSH receptor sites. In turn, FSH stimulates granulosa cells to produce estrogens. This synergistic activity of estrogen and FSH allows for follicle growth and development in the ovary. = Desensitization = The FSHR become desensitized when exposed to FSH for some time. A key reaction of this downregulation is the phosphorylation of the intracellular (or cytoplasmic) receptor domain by protein kinases. This process uncouples Gs protein from the FSHR. Another way to desensitize is to uncouple the regulatory and catalytic units of the cAMP system. = Downregulation = Downregulation refers to the decrease in the number of receptor sites. This can be accomplished by metabolizing bound FSHR sites. The bound FSH-receptor complex is brought by lateral migration to a \\"coated pit,\\" where such units are concentrated and then stabilized by a framework of clathrins. A pinched-off coated pit is internalized and degraded by lysosomes. Proteins may be metabolized or the receptor can be recycled. Use of long-acting agonists will downregulate the receptor population. = Modulators = Antibodies to FSHR can interfere with FSHR activity.  FSH abnormalities  Some patients with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may have mutations in the gene for FSHR, making them more sensitive to gonadotropin stimulation. Women with 46 XX gonadal dysgenesis experience primary amenorrhea with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. There are forms of 46 xx gonadal dysgenesis wherein abnormalities in the FSH- receptor have been reported and are thought to be the cause of the hypogonadism. Polymorphism may affect FSH receptor populations and lead to poorer responses in infertile women receiving FSH medication for IVF.  History  Alfred G.

The terms of the loans are described in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (with subsequent amendments), which guarantees repayment to the lender if a student defaults. In 1988, Congress renamed the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan program the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan program, in honor of U.S. Senator Robert Stafford, a Republican from Vermont, for his work on higher education. Because the loans are guaranteed by the full faith of the US government, they are offered at a lower interest rate than the borrower would otherwise be able to get for a private loan. On the other hand, there are strict eligibility requirements and borrowing limits on Stafford Loans. As with other types of federal financial aid, students applying for a Stafford Loan must complete a FAFSA. Stafford Loans are available to students directly from the United States Department of Education through the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP, also known as Direct). No principal payments are expected on the loan while the student is in school enrolled at least half-time, referred to as in-school deferment. Deferment of repayment continues for six months after the student leaves school by graduating, dropping below half-time enrollment, or withdrawing, referred to as the grace period. Stafford Loans are available both as subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans are offered to students based on demonstrated financial need. (See Expected Family Contribution.) The interest on subsidized loans is paid by the federal government while the student is in school and during authorized deferment. For unsubsidized Stafford Loans, students are responsible for all of the interest that accrues while the student is enrolled in school. The interest may be deferred throughout enrollment. Unpaid interest that is deferred until after graduation is capitalized (added to the loan principal). The Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated subsidized Stafford loans for graduate and professional students effective July 1, 2012. Unsubsidized Stafford loans are still available to these students. Interest rates Interest rates on Stafford Loans may vary and are determined based upon the date the loan was disbursed. They may also vary by the education level (undergraduate or graduate) of the student. Interest rates do not vary with default risk: all students receive the same interest rate regardless of their major or their future employment prospects. For variable rate loans, the rates are set annually using the price of the 91-day Treasury bill on the last Monday of May, and become effective for the following year on July 1. For fiscal year 2008-2009, the 91-day Treasury bill auctioned on May 27, 2008 at 1.905% (rounded to 1.91%) was used for the calculation. On May 26, 2009 the 91-day Treasury bill was auctioned at an investment rate of 0.178%. On July 1, 2009, the base rate for variable rate Stafford Loans were adjusted to 0.18%. Loans issued before July 1, 1998 were adjusted to a rate of 3.28%. Loans issued between July 1, 1998 and June 30, 2006 were adjusted to a rate of 2.48%. As of June 16, 2020, all Stafford Loans are issued with a fixed interest rate. For direct loans and most loan providers, the rate is currently set at 6.6% for unsubsidized loans, with lower rates for subsidized loans for undergraduates, usually about 5.05%. On August 9, 2013, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, changing how student loan interest rates are determined. The bill links student loan rates to the Federal 10-year Treasury rate, plus a small margin. The new rates are retroactive for all loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013. That effectively reversed an increase in interest rate from 3.40% to 6.80% for affected loans. Federal student loan interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan; however, the rates for new loans will change annually, based on the current market. The interest rates for the 2013-2014 academic year are as follows: 3.86% for undergraduate Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) 5.41% for graduate Stafford Loans See also *Loan waiver References External links Student loans in the United States ","title":"Stafford Loan"},{"id":"5746863","text":"Erwin Pr√∂ll Erwin Pr√∂ll (born 24 December 1946, in Ziersdorf-Radlbrunn), is an Austrian conservative politician (√ñVP). From 1992 to 2017, he was the Governor of Lower Austria. He was born in Radlbrunn, Lower Austria and after obtaining his Matura at Tulln he studied at the University of Natural Resources (BOKU), Vienna.  Political life  The transfer of the regional administration of Lower Austria from Vienna to Sankt P√∂lten took place during his administration. Pr√∂ll is seen as a supporter of a Grand Coalition between the √ñVP and Social Democratic Party (SP√ñ). In the year 2000 he was still a supporter of the \\"black-blue\\" coalition (√ñVP with the Freedom Party (FP√ñ)), but two years later argued against such an arrangement. Pr√∂ll also has a good relationship with Viennese mayor Michael H√§upl (SP√ñ). Great interest was aroused in Europe when he proposed a tax on mobile phone masts in the state of Lower Austria. Together with the SP√ñ he suggested legally regulating mobile phone transmitters, with the aim of reducing the overall number. At the same time the state planned to set up a local telecommunications infrastructure by means of a Wireless LAN. After an agreement with the mobile radio companies, the taxation was not realized. The agreement in fact was used as an example for other regions. In 2006 he hosted a conference with EU politicians over subsidiarity in Sankt P√∂lten. Pr√∂ll is married with four children. He is the uncle of Josef Pr√∂ll, former Austrian Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finance. The magazine Falter in 2002 reported the response by regional party secretary Ernst Strasser to criticism of Pr√∂ll's confession that he had only ever managed to finish one book, Karl May's cowboy novel Der Schatz im Silbersee (The Treasure of Silver Lake): \\"People like that, at least it shows the governor isn't a know-all.\\"Gerald John and Nina Weissensteiner, \\"Hohe Stirn, flaches Land\\", Falter, 28 August 2002 In September 2014, in an interview with the newspaper Kurier, he denied any interest in being a candidate for the Presidential election due in 2016, saying the idea left him cold: \\"My life plan is different\\".http://kurier.at/politik/inland/hofburg-proell-will-nicht- bei-bundespraesidentenwahl-kandidieren/83.888.024 Reports in April 2015, however, suggested that he had sounded out the idea with his staff.http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/kulisse/4710280/Wenn- Proll-Bundespraesident-werden-will-will-auch-die-OVP  References   External links   Erwin Pr√∂ll at the website of the Lower Austrian Government * An article about Erwin Pr√∂ll at the Austrian Lexikon of AEIOU 1946 births Living people Governors of Lower Austria (after 1918) Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna alumni ","title":"Erwin Pr√∂ll"},{"id":"5746867","text":"Bernie Little (born in McComb, Ohio, USA c. 1926 - died April 25, 2003) was the most successful owner in Unlimited Hydroplane racing history.

It consists of over 280 Internet message boards for patient to patient health support (also referred to as a virtual community or an online health community). HealthBoards was one of the first stand alone health community websites. Health communities prior to it had generally been part of large web portals (WebMD, Yahoo, iVillage, etc.). The HealthBoards members post messages to share information and support on a wide range of health issues such as cancer, back pain, autism, and women's health. As of October 2013, the site had over 1 million registered members, 5 million posted messages, and over 10 million monthly visitors. History HealthBoards was founded in 1998 by Charles Simmons, a software engineer in Los Angeles, California. In 1997, after experiencing a variety of symptoms for which doctors had no explanation, Simmons turned to the Web for answers and support. When he did not find online support groups in the areas he needed, he realized that there was a need for a health support website covering a wide range of health topics. After a year of development, HealthBoards was launched on July 26, 1998, with 70 message boards. The original site was developed using custom Perl software written by Simmons. HealthBoards quickly gained popularity. In January 2001, the site began using an internet forum software package called UBB. By November 2003, HealthBoards had reached 100,000 members. Due to considerable growth in traffic and problems with UBB, the site was transitioned to VBulletin 3.0, a more robust internet forum software system. After 2003 HealthBoards experienced its most rapid growth and became one of the largest health communities on the Web. In 2005 HealthBoards was rated as one of the top 20 health websites by Consumer Reports Health WebWatch. Consumer Reports HealthRatings.org Top 20 Health Information Websites.\\"http://www.healthratings.org\\", June 10, 2005 Selection for inclusion as a \\"Top 20\\" site was based solely on web traffic volume. These sites were then evaluated using criteria developed by Consumers Union in partnership with Health Improvement Institute. Areas of evaluation included ease of use, accessibility, transparency, editorial adequacy, advertising, and information reliability among others. The site was among eight that received an overall good rating though its evaluation at the time noted its content ‚Äù...has no authoritative information, anyone can post any claim‚Äù. In 2011 the site was acquired by Internet Brands. Operation On HealthBoards, health topics are given individual message boards.

History =19th century= Construction of the Kenosha, Rockford and Rock Island Railroad was encouraged by the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin. The 72-mile line began as an independent enterprise created by several Kenosha businessmen in 1853 and it was opened on July 21, 1861. Earlier plans had called for the line to be built between Kenosha and Beloit, Wisconsin, but Beloit had shown little interest in being the western terminus of the line. The construction of the railroad encouraged the development of various communities along the line. Passenger traffic was usually light; the line served several tourist areas along the numerous lake resorts in western Kenosha County. =20th century= As many as twelve daily trains operated during the early 20th Century; freight traffic included milk and ice from the numerous dairies and lakes along the route. The line was renamed the Kenosha and Rockford Railroad and it was eventually purchased by the Chicago and North Western Railroad. Under the CNW, it became known as the Kenosha Division, or the KD Line. Electric refrigeration became widespread in the 1930s and the need for ice diminished. Dairy farmers also turned to trucking during and after World War II, further decreasing traffic levels. By 1938, only two mixed trains still operated, and passenger counts had diminished to one or two riders per day. The main portion of the KD Line was abandoned by the C&NW; on May 31, 1939. A crew of five on Train No. 917 left Kenosha at 9:30 AM with three fare-paying passengers: rail historian Anton E. Klova and Kenosha County Historical Society officials William E. Dickinson and C. Ernest Dewey, plus retired KD Line conductor P. H. Galligan, who rode as far as Salem. En route, the crew of No. 917 made lengthy stops at each station to strip its contents and load them aboard No. 917, which as a result arrived at Harvard, Illinois nearly eight hours late. At its industrial far west and east ends the KD served a number of industries. The KD's biggest customer was perhaps were the American Motors Company factories in Kenosha until Chrysler, which purchased AMC in 1987, began shutting down operations over the following years. Prior to AMC it was a Nash plant. In Loves Park the KD serviced the Warner-Lambert plant which made chewing gum, Borg-Warner, and Barber-Colman. Warner-Lambert continues in operation today under Mondelez ownership but is no longer rail served though it still maintains a connection to the KD. Three short segments of the KD Line remain in operation today. Union Pacific services two customers in Loves Park, IL, Rock Valley Oil & Chemical and the Cimco scrapyard, using the KD Line from Rockford north. The Rockford Park District operates a seasonal, self-propelled streetcar over the KD on summer weekends when UP is not operating. From Chemung, IL, east to Harvard, IL, the Chicago-Chemung Railroad operates over 3.5 miles of the former KD Line where it connects a large grain elevator operation in Chemung to the UP Harvard Subdivision. In Wisconsin the KD Line, also called the Farm Line in this section, is in service by UP from Bain Station into downtown Kenosha. It is primarily used by UP to connect its New Line to the Old Line or Kenosha Subdivision but it does have one active, online customer left, the Ocean Spray plant on the west end. On a sunny fall day, a pair of engines is headed north on the KD Line on street trackage in Rockford. Rockford Park District streetcar heads north along the Rock River and on the KD Line.

A self-professed trailbuilder described as a \\"benign but enthusiastic eccentric\\", Otto arrived in Grand Junction, Colorado in 1906, helped construct a municipal waterline between Pi√±on Mesa and Fruita, Colorado, and acquainted himself with the neighboring topography. In 1907, Otto wrote, \\"I came here last year and found these canyons, and they felt like the heart of the world to me. I'm going to stay and promote this place, because it should be a national park.\\" Because of his efforts to promote and protect the area, others took notice, and by 1909 the local newspaper was lobbying to make the area a national park. On May 24, 1911, the area was designated Colorado National Monument. Otto was hired as the Monument's first custodian, in which capacity he earned one dollar per month until leaving the post in 1929. According to Horace Albright, \\"Otto was a marvelous guide and knew every inch of his monument, which he tended like a personal kingdom.\\" Among his accomplishments was carving a steep stairway up the near-vertical ascent of Independence Monument, the largest such feature in the park, which after the park's designation he used to summit the monolith and raise an American flag. He was often dubbed \\"The Trail Builder\\" or \\"The Hermit of Monument Park\\" in newspaper and magazine stories, and was rarely seen without his two burros (named Foxie and Cookie) laden with camping equipment and provisions. Born in Marthasville, Missouri, he married Beatrice Farnham on June 20, 1911, at a rustic altar near the base of Independence Monument in what is known today as Wedding Canyon. They divorced in 1912. Otto lived his final twenty years on a mining claim near Yreka, California, where he was buried in a pauper's grave.

Student life Born about 1874, Mokshada Charan was son of Shyama Charan Khasnabis of Paikpara, Dhaka district, now in Bangladesh. He spent long years in Benares to have a genuine schooling in the Sanskrit classics and the Vedic texts. G.C. Denham of the Central Criminal Intelligence Department noted: \\"The position of Benares as a centre of revolutionary activity is very similar to the position which it holds in the religious life of the Hindu inhabitants of India.\\".Terrorism, Vol.V, p.137. He mentioned it as a retreat for political refugees and, since the visit of B.G. Tilak in 1900, followed by the issuing of the Kalidas newspaper, Benares became a congenial spot for seditious activities. Several amongst the Bengalis in Benares were connected with the revolutionary movement in Kolkata, principally through a certain Suranath Bhaduri, son of Somnath Bhaduri: a curious character, who was ultimately concerned in the conspiracy in Kolkata and afterwards seems to have attempted to sell the information to the authorities. Somnath was \\"one of the pioneers of nationalism\\" in Benares and, in the Bengali year 1309 (1902‚Äì03) he published a book called Gangajal, found with Mokhoda at the time of his first arrest at Benares. It conveyed revolutionary lessons under the guise of religion. The writer, addressing the god Sri Krishna says, \\"The mlechas (untouchables, an abusive term for non-Hindus, here used for foreigners) are carrying away to their own country the riches and intelligence of India, and the Vedas (sacred books) and the religion of India are being trampled under the feet of foreign nations. Wilt thou come and uproot the mlechas and make India free?\\" To this Sri Krishna replies, \\"I have come, descending upon India. The auspicious hour is here; in my name advance boldly like heroes.\\" The reference here is to the promise of Sri Krishna contained in a passage in the Bhagavad Gita; Suranath had a good deal to do with the adoption of this verse as the motto of the seditious Yugantar ('Epoch's End') newspaper of Kolkata. Mokhoda was Suranath's associate.Ker, p.25. Shortly before the publication of the Yugantar from Kolkata, early March 1906, Mokhada's friend Preonath Karar of Serampore (later known as Sri Yukteswar Giri) reached Benares and, with the help of Hrishikesh Kanjilal of the Kolkata Anushilan Samiti and Suranath, convened a public meeting as well as a meeting of the pundits: by quotations from the Hindu Astrology and Astronomy, it was announced that the sinful Iron Age was over and it was now the dawn of Yugantar or the Dvapara Yuga (sic!). Hrishikesh undertook a tour of pilgrimage to proclaim the advent of the New Age and incite the sannyasis (roving monks) in a rebellion against the English.Terrorism, p.155. Revolutionary contacts Already in September 1905, inspired by Sri Aurobindo, the ministers of Hindu religion were to spread the anti-Partition agitation. A.C. Banerji, Barrister-at-Law from Santipur in Nadia and a friend of Jatindranath Mukherjee, obtained the aid of the Nabadwip Pundits and Goswamis : their influence, throughout India, roused the religious scruples of both Hindus and Muslims concerning the impurity in the manufacture of salt and sugar, as much as their boycott of foreign goods. As it will be presently seen, Mokhoda was a close collaborator of Kartik Datta of Santipur. Under Mokhoda's leadership, the Bhatpara Pundits in the 24 Parganas sent out missionaries in Upper India. At Puri in Orissa, one hundred itinerant monks had vowed to preach the Swadeshi. On 28 September 1905, fifty thousand people before the Kolkata Kali temple took the vow of abstaining from purchasing foreign goods. The Ramakrishna Mission and the Arya Samaj considerably helped spreading this doctrine.F.C. Daly, in Terrorism, Vol. I, p.18. Admitting that Mokhoda studied Sanskrit for many years at Benares and earned the Pandit title of Samadhyayi, Denham informed that he was posted at the Uttarpara College in the Hooghly district. Mokhoda, in company of Professor Charu Chandra Ray, Preonath Karar (Sri Yukteswar Giri) and Satish Sen, animated the clubs and associations in the region covering Chinsura, Serampore, Chandernagore with the teachings of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (who had lived there), Yogendra Vidyabhushan and other thought leaders of the epoch. He frequented the revolutionary monk Tarakshepa who, sermoning on the Bhagavad Gita, preached sedition overtly. Informed about a dynamic batch of students in the neighbouring 24 Parganas, Mokhoda went to Chingripota, Harinabhi, Kodalia, where Harikumar Chakravarti, Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy, Saileshwar Bose, Satkari Banerji had started a powerful association. Harikumar was in touch with his cousins, Naren and Phani Chakravarti, who had been to school with Barin Ghosh at Deoghar and worked in Barin's bomb factory there. At Serampore, Brahmabandhab Upadhyay was attracted by Mokhoda's learning and his ideas on politics, while accepting him as disciple to run the 'Brahmacharya Ashram'. One of Barin's cousins, the famous journalist Hemendraprasad Ghosh, wrote that Mokhoda had a room also at the 'Field and Academy' founded by Upadhyay, by the side of the Kolkata Anushilan Samiti : here he knew eminent future citizens like Benoykumar Sarkar and Radhakumud Mukherjee. Mokhoda arranged and shared his room with Naren Bhattacharya and Harikumar, before they found shelter at the Anushilan building itself, at 49 Cornwallis Street, while Naren's cousin Abi Bhattacharya with Barin and some other like-minded friends were moving to a centre of their own.Prithwindra Mukherjee, S√¢dhak-biplab√Æ jat√Ændran√¢th, p479 Political outrages Mokhoda was naturally in close touch with all that was advanced in Indian politics and at the ‚ÄòAcademy and Art Club‚Äô, which was financed by Subodh Mullick, he met all the leaders of the new movement. He took a post of Sanskrit at the National College on a small salary and became Sri Aurobindo's colleague. Denham believed that it was Mokhoda who incited the strike on the East Indian Railway between Howrah and Andal. While being prosecuted for sedition, Brahmabandhav Upadhyay died in jail in October 1907. Mokhoda became the real master and the director of Upadhyay's sarcastically anti-British journal Sandhya and the band of young men attached to it. At this juncture, Suranath is reported to have formed a central committee at the Sandhya office with the help of his disciple Jatin Banerjee alias Niralamba Swami (who had returned from Upper India, to succeed Upadhyay as editor) and Kartik Datta; Mokhada, Shamsundar Chakravarti, Sri Aurobindo, Tarakshepa, Annada Kaviraj and some others as members, they all seemed to share Upadhyay's political principles. (Terrorism V, p150). While on 6 December 1907, Barin's men attempted to wreck with explosives the Lieutenant-Governor's special train at Naraingarh, on the same evening, arranged by Mokhoda, Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy, Bhushan Mitra alias Gulay and Sailen Basu committed a hold-up at Chingripota Railway Station, and were arrested. Jatindra Mukherjee appointed his friend, Barrister J.N. Roy, to defend them. They got discharged. Earlier, in 1907, Indra Nandi sent members of Atmonnati Samiti, including Pabitra Datta and Chuni Mitra, to found at Benares the 'Matri Sebak Samiti'. \\"This is distinctly suspicious,\\" mentions the Police report. Associating with the Yugantar and the Sandhya gangs, in May 1908, a few days before Khudiram and Prafulla Chaki started for Muzaffarpur, Suranath returned from Kolkata to establish a local branch of the Anushilan in Benares, with the help of, Sudhangshu Mitra, Sachin Sanyal, a student in the entrance class of the Bengalitola High School, and his \\"Tantrik disciple\\" Debnarayan Mukherjee. Sachin kept \\"himself all along in the back ground and printed and circulated widely at Benares a seditious pamphlet on the occasion of the anniversary of Maharaja Pratapaditya at the instance of the Bengali anarchists, in order to instigate the youths of Benares,\\" noted Denham. \\"Suranath induced Jatin Banerjee and Mokhoda to come over to Benares during the Puja holidays.\\" Mokhoda advised the members of the party as to their future course of conduct. \\"Mokhada and a few other unknown men are trying to unite the extremists and the nationalists into one common bond of partisanship,\\" wrote Denham. \\"A plan is also under consideration to get the Mussalmans of Turkey and Persia to prejudice the illiterate Muhammadan mass of this country against the English and to send two or three clever English- educated Bengalis to Kabul in the guise of Mussalman fakirs after making them versed in the Koran, and also to bring up after some time Arabindo Ghose (or Sri Aurobindo) either to Benares or to some other place for a secret consultation between him and Suranath.\\".Terrorism, Vol. V, p.152. Raja Sasisekhareswar of Tahirpur, the principal man in the 'Bharat Dharma Mahamandal', had been fully converted to Suranath's and Mokhada's creed. Through his father, Somanath Bhaduri, Private Secretary to Maharaja of Darbhanga, the General president of the 'Mahamandal', Suranath was trying to influence the Prince. He tried it also through Amarendra Chatterjee, whose father-in-law, Preonath Banerjee, was the Maharaja's General manager. (Terrorism, Vol.V, pp 117‚Äì119). Shortly before the Maniktola arrests in May 1908, there was a split in the Yugantar, following Barin's concentration on applied terrorism, leaving the theoretical preparation to others: (a) under Sri Aurobindo's guidance, Abi Bhattacharya took over the defunct Navashakti; (b) under Abi Chakravarti's influence, Nikhileshwar Ray Maulik controlled the Yugantar, shifting its office to 68 Maniktola Street, where Nikhileswar and Kartik Datta lived. Jatindranath Mukherjee served as a link between these different trends. After the arrests, the Yugantar articles under his direct influence became even more violent, causing several prosecutions, before collapsing in June 1908. Police Records show how eager Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray was to distribute the Yugantar, and informed the editor that Jatindranath Mukherjee knew him personally. In June 1908, less than two months after the arrest of the Maniktola conspirators, a \\"new gang\\" - symbol of a new spirit - commenced operations on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The series of outrages began with a bomb thrown into a train. The Police experts held that the bombs used in these occasions were inferior to those prepared by Barin Ghosh's party; instead of dynamite or picric acid, these were coconut shell bombs with a mixture of sulphide of arsenic and chlorate of potash stuffed with bits of broken glass, nails, pins of jute combs, causing great injury on explosion. These outrages continued sporadically till April 1909. The Special Department of the Police traced them to a gang of Brahmans in Bhatpara, led by Kartik Datta and Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy, advised by Mokhoda. On 4 March 1907, Kartik had distinguished himself by leading the attempt to murder the missionary in Nadia. He and Mokhoda took part in the dacoities, reported F.C. Daly \\"to raise funds for political purposes (‚Ä¶), defence of persons under trial in political cases\\". Six persons were put on trial before the Special Tribunal of the High Court. Mokhoda was one of them. The jury found him not guilty: he was acquitted for the second time. \\"A most dangerous character. He is still maintaining his connection with the most desperate ruffians of the revolutionary party (‚Ä¶) Sub-Editor of the Nayak ('The Leader'), at present the most frankly seditious newspaper in Kolkata.\\"Terrorism, Vol. I, p.34. When Nikhileswar was arrested on 23 June 1908, it was Kartik's turn to assume control of the party in charge of the Jugantar, with the printing press at 28 Shampukur Street. There was a house in Chetla for their secret meetings. Kartik was joined by Keshab De, who was just released after two years of Rigorous Imprisonment for having thrown vitriol during East India Railway strike in 1906. As a direct descendant of the old Jugantar group, Mokhoda became their advisor. Several outrages were committed from Chetla, including the Bajitpur robbery (15 August 1908). Important among the participants were Noren Basu, Noren Chatterji, Bepin Ganguli, Annada Kaviraj, Suresh Mitra, Indra Nandi, Jatin Ray. One of the older organisers of revolutionary work, Bhupati Charan Bose (b 1864), son of Uma Charan Bose of Kolkata, was another associate of Kartik Datta and Mokhoda. He was a \\"well-to- do broker for the German firm of Norlinger & Co\\" in Kolkata. Kartik moved his headquarters to Telinipara, near Chandernagore, before proceeding to the Bighati dacoity on 16 September 1908. At Bighati in Hooghly, noted Denham, a rich man opposed to swadeshi was robbed. Immediate arrest of Kartik, Suresh Majumdar, Basanta, Pannalal Chakrabarti and Dhiren Ghosh, followed by the arrest of Mokhada, Suresh Mitra and Pannalal Chatterji (turned approver). Keshab absconded with the booty. Mokhoda Pandit had in his possession some part of the ornaments stolen at Bajitpur in Mymensingh; certain jewellery he gave to sell to a goldsmith tallied in weight and description with a portion of the property stolen. Other participants were : Biren Mallik, Manmohan Barman, and Beharilal Ray. The Police recognised Mokhoda, once more, as \\"the guru of the band, a recruiting agent, active participant in the dacoity.\\" The Yugantar Split On the breakup of the Yugantar, Mokhoda had joined Kartik, and had helped in giving advice and shelter to revolutionaries, as well as in obtaining arms and disposing of stolen property. In spite of several charges, they were unanimously acquitted. Resulting from the Bighati case, there was a fusion with Jogen Tagore‚Äôs Bhatpara group, with Naren Bhattacharya, \\"a notable personage\\", intimate with Mokhoda. Nixon mentioned seven major outrages between 22 June 1908 and 15 April 1909, committed by this group.Terrorism, vol.II, p.531. At this stage, the Police found the Province divided up as follows: 1) Kolkata : led by Indra Nandi; 2) 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly: Nanigopal Sengupta; 3) Rajshahi, Nadia, Jessore, Hooghly: Jatindra Mukherjee; 4) Natore, Dighapatiya, Amalpur: Satish Sarkar; 5) Mymensingh, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Jamalpur, Cooch Behar: Amaresh Kanjilal; 6) Berhampur, Murshidabad : Suren Chakravarti. Nanigopal and Jatindra had originally been members of the Kolkata Anushilan Samiti and acted directly under Sri Aurobindo's guidance, maintaining a constant collaboration. After quarrelling with Satish Basu, Nanigopal absorbed most of the members of Mokhoda-cum-Kartik's dispersed group, since the latter's arrest. Amaresh and Satish Sarkar worked under Jatindranath Mukherjee. Belonging to Indra's group (Atmonnati), Bepin Ganguli, Noren Bose and Noren Chatterji, too remained close to Jatindra's policy. These revolutionaries committed sixteen outrages between March 1908 and October 1909. Denham noted in 1909 on the 'Sarathi Jubak Mandali': \\"perhaps second only in importance to the Anushilan Samiti for the number of persons included in its ranks who actually took part in crimes of violence\\". Their spiritual guide was Tarakshepa alias Tarapado Banerji, a \\"mysterious Sadhu, who wandered about Bengal, being most frequently heard of in the districts of Birbhum, Nadia or in Kolkata\\". He was disciple of Bamakhepa of Tarapur in Birbhum, \\"having possessed hypnotic power\\"; Nanigopal Sengupta was his disciple. He frequented Jogendranath Tagore, \\"an undesirable member of the Tagore family\\": his \\"influence with the revolutionary party is still considerable\\"; he was a link \\"between the parties who work in Bengal proper and the Eastern Bengal and Assam dacoity gangs.\\" Denham knew that Kartik's arrest was rather a shock to the members of this group. Kartik was acquitted, to be charged again with harbouring four of the revolutionary ‚Äòbandits‚Äô, but acquitted by a Howrah jury. He was released on 27 December 1909, after having served a term of Rigorous Imprisonment in connection with the assault committed on Higginbothams as well as with the dacoities at Bajitpur and Bighati : leaders of the Nadia units - Jatindranath Mukherjee and his uncle, the pleader Lalitkumar Chatterjee of Krishnagar-received him with a hero's ovation, as recorded by the approver Lalit Chakravarti nicknamed Benga.Prithwindra Mukherjee, S√¢dhak-biplabi jatindranath,[abbrev. jatindranath], p.196, p.222. On 30 March 1910, Benga confessed that even before the Netra outrage, he had spent one day at Nanigopal's, before Suresh Majumdar alias Paran took him to a pleader of the Kolkata High Court. He spent there two or three days. The \\"Nimai chogra\\" took him by night train to Krishnagar. Nimai or Nirmalkumar was the son of the Government pleader Basantakumar Chatterjee, Jatindra Mukherjee's uncle. He left Benga with the pleader Lalit Chatterjee's mohurrir (clerk), Nibaran Chakravarti alias Karuda : the latter had bedding and food ready for Benga. Bholadanga zamindar's son Manmatha Biswas was \\"of our society\\". After a few days, he returned to Kolkata. On 24 January 1910, the assassination of Shamsul Alam led the Viceroy Minto to admit the efficient spirit of the new 'Yugantar' under the over-all leadership of Jatindranath Mukherjee: \\"A spirit hitherto unknown to India has come into existence (...), a spirit of anarchy and lawlessness which seeks to subvert not only British rule but the Governments of Indian Chiefs...\\".MTP, M.1092, in M.N.Das, p.122. Minto's successor, Lord Hardinge regretted in a letter, in the slippery context of the Howrah Gang Case : \\"In fact, nothing could be worse, in my opinion, than the condition of Bengal and Eastern Bengal. There is practically no Government in either province, but I am determined to restore order.\\".Hardinge Papers,in Prithwindra Mukherjee/1977, p.249. In the meantime, Mokhoda had gone back to Dhaka in February 1910. In March 1910 an attempt was made to assassinate G.C. Denham of the Criminal Investigation Department and a very prominent figure of the Alipore conspiracy (1908‚Äì1909). At the same time, a \\"Strictly Confidential\\" note (p. 184), added to Denham's report, mentioned that connection was established between Suranath and Amarendra Chatterjee, editor of the Bengali Karmayogin and esteemed associate of Sri Aurobindo and Jatindranath Mukherjee; the mess at 133 Lower Circular Road of Kolkata, served Amarendra and Makhanlal Sen for \\"seeing and conferring with the notorious [sic!] Jatindra Mukherjee\\".Terrorism, Vol. V, p.193 Amarendra's paper was almost a Bengali version of Sri Aurobindo's Karmayogin in English; it had also a Hindi edition published from Benares. It was Amarendra who sent Basanta Biswas to Benares, to assist Rasbehari Bose. \\"In or about this same year (1910) Gyanananda Swami (Jogeshwar Mukherjee), a great friend of Mokhoda, who was for sometime secretary of the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal ('All India Great Federation of Religion'), the headquarters of which are at Benares, was in correspondence with Amarendranath Chatterjee in Bengal.\\".\\"Strictly Confidential\\" Documents in Terrorism, Vol. V, p.184. Finding Bengal too hot to hold him, Jatindra's associate Kiran Mukherjee visited Mokhoda at Benares in 1911, and stayed with Sarada Maitra of Rangpur. Mokhoda returned to Kolkata, in 1911: in February, the revolutionaries shot dead Srish Chakravarti, the head constable of Kolkata Police, who was a former member of the Yugantar gang, turned informer. According to F.C. Daly: : \\"It is a singular coincidence, if it is only a coincidence, that this murder took place on the evening of the day on which Jatindranath Mukherjee (‚Ä¶) was set free from the dock at the High Court (‚Ä¶) It is likely that Jatin's release put fresh heart into the people who had been contemplating further outrages but hesitating to act.‚ÄùTerrorism, V/p184 Mokhoda was strongly suspected in this connection. Descendant of Mokhoda's Bhatpara group, the Baranagar group reunited a series of small samitis (e.g. the 'Jubak Samiti' with its clubs and poor fund) in the north of Kolkata and in Howrah on the other side of the river Hooghly and operated since 1907; they had contacts with Jogen Tagore, Mokhoda and the Ramakrishna Mission. Again, in December 1911, Mokhoda was seen in Benares and, in the same month, an Inspector of Police was shot dead: the man was \\"in possession of information regarding a dangerous organiser of political dacoities named Pandit Mokhoda Charan Samadhyaya.\\" E.H. Corbet, Superintendent of Police, noted that Mokhoda: : \\"was a bosom friend of the police Bengali informer. The matter was referred to Government and I was sent to Benares to interview the Commissioner and Magistrate, with the result that he was arrested (‚Ä¶) A strong and elaborate case under Section 110(f), Criminal Procedure Code.‚Äù Mokhoda was to have a conviction for three years; but it was decided after the Durbar (Coronation ceremony) to drop the proceeding. Mokhada was warned not to come back to Benares again. Jatindra Mukherjee and Rash Behari Bose, however, visited Benares in May 1912 and associated with Sachin Sanyal, Mokhoda and Suranath. Soon, Sachin became the sole leader there. Vinayak Rao Kaple was one of its members. Sarada Maitra of Rangpur and Satish Mukherjee of Barisal frequently visited Benares; the latter associated with Mokhoda the members of the Sevak Samiti. During 1913, Jogen Tagore led a series of dacoities; in 1915 he got contact with Bipin Ganguli‚Äôs followers including Probhas De and Harish Sikdar, and came to know members of other groups including Atulkrishna Ghosh and Ananta Haldar, (all of them acting under Jatindra Mukherjee). Bipin was sentenced to five years Rigorous Imprisonment on 2 August 1915 in the Agarpara Dacoity Case. Epilogue Two years later, Mokhoda was prosecuted at Benares in a so-called Insurance fraud case; he was convicted in February 1914, and sentenced to three years‚Äô imprisonment. No subsequent information about this firebrand scholar is available. Notes The following are notes about Mokhoda Samadhyayi: Mokshada's name has been variously spelt in the Police notes; for the present article, we have kept \\"Mokhoda\\", as the closest phonetical transcription. However, other spellings include: Mokshada Charan or Mokhoda Charan Bhattacharji or Khasnabis, and Mokshadacharan Samadhyayi.

It is officially designated on the National Register of Historic Places by The United States Department of the Interior. The Aquitania, known legally as the 5000 North Marine Drive Corporation, was built by Ralph C. Harris and Byron H. Jillson in the Classical Revival style. Its developer was George K. Spoor, the co-founder of Essanay Studios and a producer of silent movies during the first two decades of the 20th century. At that time, Chicago rivaled both New York City and Hollywood in film production, and Spoor was able to use his considerable wealth to plan and develop a property, which he felt was befitting the celebrities connected with Chicago's growing entertainment industry. A legend, which purports that Essanay Studio actors Charlie Chaplain and Gloria Swanson once resided at The Aquitania, is likely unfounded. This probable factual inaccuracy reflects nothing more than film lore since all silent film production left Chicago's Essanay studios for southern California by 1918 at the very latest, and The Aquitania was not built until 1923, although there are historical accounts of both silent-film era stars staying as guests at The Aquitania when it was a hotel in its earliest days. When the Aquitania was built, it was situated directly on the Lake Michigan shore; subsequent development of both Lake Shore Drive and the lakefront park have moved the shore some two blocks east of the building. The fifteen-story building has a courtyard and an Art Moderne lobby. Construction was completed in 1923, and it became a cooperative in 1949.Real estate Housing profiles The Aquitania See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Chicago References  External links  *National Register of Historic Places Cook County *5000 N Marine Drive Corporation Apartment buildings in Chicago Historic preservation Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Housing cooperatives in the United States ","title":"The Aquitania"},{"id":"5747022","text":"The following are the Pulitzer Prizes for 1943.

Her memoir, Speaking Up, was published by Melbourne University Press in 2018. = Human Rights Commission = Triggs at the 2015 Human Rights Awards On 27 July 2012, Triggs retired as Dean of the Sydney Law School to take up her appointment as the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, for a period of five years commencing 30 July 2012. Following the resignation of Helen Szoke, she was Acting Race Discrimination Commissioner from January to August 2013, until Tim Soutphommasane was appointed to the role. On 3 February 2014, almost two years after her appointment as the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission but only a few months after the election of the Abbott Government, Triggs launched the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014, to \\"investigate the ways in which life in immigration detention affects the health, well-being and development of children.\\" Since late in 2014, and following the release of the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014, there was an increase in tensions between the Australian Government under Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Office of the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission. Government Ministers subsequently called for Triggs to step down from the presidency of the Australian Human Rights Commission. They alleged that the report was politically motivated and that Triggs' decision not to conduct a review during the term of the previous Labor government was evidence of this. In October 2016, it was alleged by Liberal Senator Ian MacDonald and others that Triggs had misled the Senate by stating that a journalist had misquoted comments made by Triggs about several Australian politicians. Triggs had been reported in a profile piece by The Saturday Paper as saying: \\"I knew I could have responded and destroyed them\\", with reference to a Senate Committee. Triggs asserted that these comments had been added by a \\"subeditor\\", however Triggs subsequently said that, \\"upon further reflection\\" she accepted that the article was \\"an accurate excerpt from a longer interview\\" and that she had \\"no intention of questioning The Saturday Paper's journalistic integrity.\\" On 16 November 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that the Government would not renew Triggs' commission when it expired in 2017. Her statutory term as President of the HRC expired in July 2017. In March 2017, Triggs defended her engagement to speak at a fundraising event for the Bob Brown Foundation. Liberal Senator Eric Abetz criticised the appropriateness of Triggs speaking at a fundraiser for the former Greens leader, as the Foundation conducts overtly political activist campaigns. Triggs defended her appearance, stating that event tickets would be used to cover costs, with the surplus being donated to the Bob Brown Foundation. Her appearance resulted in other senior members of government, including Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, calling for her resignation. Racial Discrimination Act controversy Triggs received significant criticism for her handling of an action involving three Queensland University of Technology (QUT) students who were accused of racial vilification under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). One of the students was alleged to have breached Section 18C because of a Facebook post which read: \\"Just got kicked out of the unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation.\\" In November 2016, the Federal Court threw out the lawsuit and Judge Michael Jarrett concluded the claim had no reasonable prospects of success. After this case was dismissed, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on the Commission to \\"urgently review\\" the way it manages race hate cases. Turnbull said that \\"what the judge was saying to the Human Rights Commission is, 'you've been wasting the court's time. You've been wasting government money'.\\" However, Triggs said she had urged the government to introduce a higher threshold before the commission was obliged to investigate hate speech complaints. She also said \\"the judge did not make any comment on the Human Rights Commission and made no such extreme, provocative statement.\\" Triggs has also defended the Commission's handling of the case and said the complaint had \\"a level of substance.\\" Senator Eric Abetz said that the three students have \\"had their reputation trashed courtesy of the Human Rights Commission.\\" Tony Morris, the lawyer who represented the students, claimed that Triggs sat on the complaint for 14 months and said she was to blame for the case making it to court. The Human Rights Commission had never contacted the students about the complaint and instead left that task to QUT. Triggs said that 11 months of the delay were due to a request by the complainant and QUT not to notify the students. An article by media outlet The Conversation described the AHRC's conduct in this case as \\"disgraceful\\" and questioned why the AHRC did not initially reject the complaints. The article suggested that the decision not to reject the complaints may have given the complainant false hope that the case had merit. Triggs in September 2018 In November 2016, Triggs supported a proposal to change Section 18C. At the time, it was unlawful to \\"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\\" on the basis of race. Triggs said removing \\"offend\\" and \\"insult\\" and inserting \\"vilify\\" would be a strengthening of the laws. However, in February 2017, Triggs told a Senate committee the AHRC did not see a case to change 18C but recommended reforms requiring that respondents be notified of complaints and allowing the president greater powers to reject complaints. Triggs said ‚Äúit‚Äôs true, the students have suffered from this ‚Ä¶ but I cannot concede the Commission did anything wrong.‚Äù Personal life Triggs resides in Sydney, and is married to former Australian diplomat Alan Brown . Triggs was previously married to Melbourne law professor Sandy Clark, with whom she had three children. Their third child, a daughter named Victoria, was born in 1984, profoundly disabled and with a short life expectancy due to a chromosome abnormality known as Edwards syndrome. She died at the age of 21. In addition to her native English, Triggs speaks some French.

Early life Armida came from a theatrical family; her father Joaquin Vendrell was a well known magician \\"The Great Arnold\\" who emigrated to Mexico from Barcelona, Spain. She also had two sisters that were performers as well, Lydia Vendrell and Lola Vendrell. By the time she reached the age of nineteen she had a lucrative, long-term screen contract. She purchased a beautiful home where she lived with her family. She aspired to send her younger sisters to college. Vendrell was just five feet tall with high heels and two inches less without them. Armida had a tiny face with two dark eyes of radiant beauty. She spoke quickly, without pausing. As a small child she spoke Spanish only. Vaudeville in California Armida started performing at a young age, when her family moved from Mexico to the United States, her father opened the first movie theater in Douglas, Arizona. She and her sisters would sing and dance during intermission and her father would perform an illusionist act. Armida was discovered in the old Hidalgo theater in the Plaza in Los Angeles. The Plaza was the oldest section of the city. Armida was appearing in a small, home-manufactured vaudeville skit, along with her sister Delores. A talent scout for a coastal vaudeville circuit was in the audience and offered her a chance to perform four shows a day, known as a \\"four-a-day\\". Armida progressed from the drama marts of the Plaza to various Broadway productions after being discovered by Gus Edwards, stage and screen actor, songwriter, and dance instructor. She participated in as many as twenty-four vaudeville numbers a day while in New York. Edwards brought her back to Hollywood with him and began to feature her in colortone novelties.

Construction of the canal began in 1733, but progress was slow and it was not officially opened until 1787. The canal was built to reduce the cost of transporting coal from the Tyrone coalfields to Dublin. An extension known as \\"Dukart's Canal\\" was built to link the coalfields of Drumglass with the head of navigation at Coalisland. It opened in 1777, but was an engineering failure, and closed when the main canal opened. After some difficulties with the infrastructure, traffic slowly increased, and did not reach its peak until 1931. Traffic then declined rapidly, and the canal was abandoned in 1954. There has recently been some interest in restoring the remains, as most of the channel is still intact, and a group has been formed, which is now part of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, to raise public awareness of the canal and investigate options for the future. A small boat rally was held on the canal in April 2008. History Coal deposits were discovered in East Tyrone at the end of the 17th century, but the coal could not be sold at Dublin, the obvious marketplace, as the cost of its transport made it considerably more expensive than coal imported from England or Scotland. The owners of the mines were mainly based in Dublin, and the first plans to build a canal to the coal- fields were made in 1709. Thomas Knox, a colliery owner, petitioned the Irish Parliament with a plan for a canal from Knock Bridge, near Gifford to Fathom Point, near Newry. The canal broadly followed the line of the later Newry Canal, but although a parliamentary committee liked the proposal, nothing came of it at the time. By 1727, some 60,000 to 70,000 tons of coal were being imported into Dublin, and the idea of supplying that from Irish sources gained popularity. Thomas Prior wrote to support a canal from Dungannon, near Coalisland, in 1727, while two years later, Arthur Dobbs the Surveyor-General outlined the advantages of a canal to Lough Neagh, which he thought could be built relatively easily. In the same year, Francis Seymour, who owned a colliery at Brackaville, near Coalisland, published a pamphlet in Belfast, entitled Remarks on a Scheme for supplying Dublin with Coals. While it supported Knox's scheme from 1709, it also suggested that a canal could be cut across a bog from Drumglass, where many of the pits were located, to join the River Torrent, from where the coal could be transported to the River Blackwater and onwards to Newry. 1729 also saw the establishment of the Commissioners of Inland Navigation for Ireland. They assessed a number of proposals, authorising work on the Newry Navigation in 1731 and a canal from Coalisland to the Blackwater in 1732. The canal would be around long, and would run broadly parallel to the River Torrent. Work began in the summer of 1733, with Acheson Johnson supervising the project. Progress was very slow, and the plan suffered from the fact that the head of navigation was still a considerable distance from the pits at Drumglass. A company was created in 1749, led by the Archbishops of Armagh and Tuam, among others, which asked the government for assistance with the construction of of roadway to link Drumglass to the canal. They were awarded a grant of ¬£4,000 to aid the project. By this time, the pits were quite productive, and could have supplied all of Dublin's needs. It was estimated that once the road and canal were finished, the coal could be sold in Dublin for six shillings (30 pence) per ton, around one third of the cost before construction started. There were difficulties with the construction, and progress remained slow. At Coalisland, a large basin was constructed, which was supplied by a feeder from the River Torrent. The river carried quantities of stones, clay and silt, which clogged the basin, locks and levels once the water entered the canal. Of the seven locks required, the upper two were built on sand, while the lower three were built in a peat bog. Both environments required the sinking of piles and the provision of paved floors to the lock chambers, neither of which were adequately done. The lower reaches were very close to the river, which flooded it when there was plenty of water, and drained it when there was not. While the much longer Newry Canal has only taken ten years to complete, the Coalisland Canal was still not finished, and the work was financed by ¬£25,000, awarded from public funds between 1746 and 1782. =Dukart's Canal= It is not known whether the road from Coalisland to Drumglass was completed, but in 1760 a Parliamentary Committee asked Thomas Omer to survey a route from the Newry Canal to the Drumglass coalfields. Although he did so, he also suggested a canal should be constructed from Coalisland to the pits. It would be long, rising through 16 locks, and cost ¬£15,668. His plans were approved in 1761, but the canal was to be capable of handling 100-ton boats. Oversight of the project passed from Omer to Christopher Myers in June 1762, who completed of the canal and part of a lock, which was . He then reported to Parliament on the likely costs for the scheme, and recommended reducing the size to take boats which were . ¬£5,000 was granted towards the initial construction, but a second opinion on the engineering aspects was sought, and a French-Italian called Daviso de Arcort, also known as Davis Dukart, suggested a radical alternative, using two level sections of canal, largely in tunnel. Coal would be carried in boxes on small tub boats, and the boxes would be lowered down vertical shafts into boats on the canal below. By November 1767, small sections of the open-air sections had been built, with part of an aqueduct over the River Torrent, at a cost of ¬£3,839. He went back for another ¬£14,457 to complete the scheme, but further discussion followed, the price was increased to ¬£26,802, and the tunnels were abandoned in favour of inclined planes, called dry hurries or dry wherries locally.River Bann and Lough Neagh Association, Coalisland Gallery, accessed 14 February 2009 The inclined planes were to have had rollers fitted on the ramps, but problems were experienced, and following advice from the civil engineers William Jessop and John Smeaton in 1773, various changes were made, including counterbalancing the boats. Still the planes could not be made to work properly, and the rollers were replaced by cradles, running on conventional rails, which carried the boats. Dukart's Canal finally opened in 1777. =Completion= The Coalisland Canal dropped through seven locks from the Coalisland Basin to the River Blackwater, and had a depth of . A towing path was provided on both sides of the channel, and it was finished in 1787. The same year saw the demise of Dukart's extension, when it was conceded that the planes were too steep to allow counterbalancing to work, and there were serious problems with water leakage on the upper section. Central control of the inland waterways was abolished in 1787, and the responsibility for the Coalisland canal was shared between the colliery owners, the Primate, the Governors and roll keepers of Tyrone. There were calls for an adequate water supply for the Drumglass to Coalisland extension, or the provision of a waggon way, in 1788, and a bill to encourage growth of the linen industry by the provision of a way to transport coal from Drumglass in 1788. The bleaching industry had to import coal from England, because they could not get it from Tyrone in 1797, and they called for a complete overhaul of the navigation. Operation The volumes of coal transported along the canal were lower than had been predicted, hampered by the lack of a proper link from Coalisland to the collieries, but trade in flaxseed, grain, rock salt, timber, fish and coarse hardware gradually built up. However, its condition deteriorated, and by 1801, it was almost derelict. Control of inland waterways was returned to central government, and the Directors General of Inland Waterways send an engineer called Henry Walker to inspect it. He began work on repairing the canal, but was dismissed and replaced by John Brownrigg in September 1801, as similar work he had carried out on the Newry Canal was alleged to be defective. Brownrigg reported that much of the canal was dangerous, and a third opinion was sought from the engineer Daniel Monks. Between 1801 and 1812, over ¬£20,000 was spent on the canal, which included scouring the basin at Coalisland, building wharves, stores and boundary walls around it, rebuilding of lock walls and floors, dredging the whole canal to give a depth of , repairs to lock houses, puddling of the lower reaches where it passed through peat, and upgrading of the towpaths. While trade in a wide variety of commodities steadily increased, coal traffic did not. Since the passing of the Act of Union in 1800, and the consequent free movement of trade between Ireland and England, Dublin had obtained all of its coal by import, which although slightly more expensive, was of much higher quality. Coalisland developed as an industrial centre, importing raw materials along the canal, and exporting tiles, bricks, earthenware, spades, shovels, sulphuric acid and sulphur, all of which were manufactured locally. Distribution of these products was however hampered by the narrower locks and shallower depth of the Ulster Canal, which connected the River Blackwater to Lough Erne. Oversight of the canal passed to The Office of Public Works (OPW) in 1831, and traffic continued to increase, from 8,200 tons in 1837 to 18,888 tons in 1866. After that date, the railways started to have a serious impact on trade, and although the canal was maintained in good order, the costs of doing so exceeded the receipts from tolls and rents. In order to avoid this situation, the government sought to find someone else to run it, and eventually sold it to the Lagan Canal Company in 1888. They increased the navigable depth to , which enabled 80-ton barges to reach Coalisland, and the carriage of sand, bricks, agricultural products, pottery, fireclay goods and Irish timber to Belfast increased significantly, as did traffic in grain, coal, hardware, foreign timber and provisions in the opposite direction. Between 1890 and 1900, total traffic increased from 18,000 tons to 36,000 tons, and a loss of ¬£89 became a profit of ¬£355. There were plans to increase the depth of the canal to , to allow through working from the Lagan Navigation, but the start of the First World War in 1914 changed the economic climate, and the canal faced increasing competition from road transport once the war was over. The canal, along with the Lagan Navigation and the Ulster Canal, was under the direct control of the British Government from 1 July 1917, but shared an improvement grant of ¬£19,000 with the Lagan Navigation when it was returned to private ownership. Despite competition, traffic in building sand, grain and coal continued to increase through the 1920s, reaching 57,000 tons in 1931, when tolls raised ¬£1,634, and the company made a profit of ¬£650. After that, traffic fell rapidly, with the company making less than ¬£50 in 1939. Very little traffic used the canal during the Second World War, and all traffic ceased in 1946. In April 1954 the canal was officially abandoned and relegated to the status of a drainage ditch, when control of it passed to the Ministry of Commerce. It subsequently came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance from 1962. Heritage The basin at Coalisland was drained in 1961, and now lies beneath the car park for the Coalisland Heritage Centre. The rest of the canal is owned by the local council and the Department of Agriculture. A group called the Friends of the Coalisland Canal was formed in the 1990s to raise public awareness of the canal, and to explore the potential benefits to the area of re-opening it. The group became a branch of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland in May 2003. They held a small boats rally in April 2008, when a number of boats sailed on parts of the canal for the first time in over 50 years. The former Coalisland Canal has left a significant legacy in Coalisland, including the 5 storey former corn mill, sited in the disused canal basin and dominating the town.

It includes an API for C and Java that allows timing information associated with each step in processing a transaction to be logged to a remote server for later analysis. History Version 1 of ARM was developed jointly by Tivoli Software and Hewlett Packard in 1996. Version 2 was developed by an industry partnership (the ARM Working Group) and became available in December 1997 as an open standard approved by the Open Group. ARM 4.0 was released in 2003 and revised in 2004. , ARM 4.1 version 1 is the latest version of the ARM standard. Introduction Current application design tends to be more complex and distributed over networks. This leads to new challenges in today's development and monitoring tools to provide application developers, system- and application administrators with the information they need. Within distributed applications it is not easy to estimate if the application performs well. The following issues help in the evaluation of distributed applications: * Are business transactions succeeding and, if not, what is the cause of failure? * What is the response time of a transaction? * Where are the bottlenecks, which sub-transaction could cause a bottleneck? * Which and how many transactions are executed in an application? * How to tune an application or its environment to perform better? ARM helps answer these questions. It's important to mention that the ARM benefits as they are defined here are now just a subset of the Application Performance Management space. Approach The main approach of using ARM is: # Define business as well as technical transactions which are of interest. # Insert calls into the application to the ARM interface to measure these defined transactions. # Deploy the instrumented application in their normal environment with an installed ARM agent. # The used ARM implementation now provides the transaction measurements of interest. Concepts ARM defines the following concepts to provide the described functionality. =ARM Application= Complex distributed applications usually consist of many different single applications (processes). In order to be able to understand the relationship between all single applications the concept of an ARM application is introduced with version 4.0 of the ARM standard. Each ARM transaction is executed exactly within one ARM application. =ARM Transaction= Transactions are the main concept of the ARM standard and represents a single performance measurement. A transaction definition defines the type (name) and additional attributes of an ARM transaction. A transaction can be executed (started and stopped) several times which results in multiple measurements. Each measurement has basic attributes like status of completion (good, failed, aborted), start- and stop timestamp, the resulting duration and the system address (host) it was executed on. Additionally special metrics or context properties can be associated with a transaction measurement. =ARM System Address= Uniquely defines a host by its name, IP address or other unique information. =ARM Correlator= ARM correlators are used to express a correlation between two ARM transactions. This is a synchronous relationship also known as parent-child relationship. Commonly, a parent transaction triggers a child transaction and only continues its execution when the child transaction has finished. Using correlators, it is possible to split a complex transaction into several nested child transactions, where each child transaction can have child transactions of its own. This results in a tree of transactions with the topmost parent transaction being the root of the tree. ARM 4.1 defines asynchronous relationships to support data flow driven architectures. =ARM Metric= ARM Metrics can be used to get more information about the execution of a transaction. ARM defines a set of metric types for different purposes such as a counter, a gauge or just a numeric value. =ARM Properties= Properties are a set of so-called name-value pair strings which qualifies an ARM transaction or an ARM application beyond the basic definition of these entities and allows to associate additional context information to each transaction measurement. =ARM User= Defines a name of a user on behalf an transaction measurement was executed. ARM Instrumented Applications The following applications are already instrumented with ARM calls: * Apache HTTP Server using the ARM 4.0 Module mod_arm4. All HTTP requests are measured using ARM. * Mozilla Firefox using the ARM 4.0 XPCOM extension npARM. * IBM WebSphere Application server. Various requests like URI, JSP and others are measured using ARM. * IBM HTTP Server. * IBM DB2 Database Server.http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/eserver/v1r2/topic/ewlminfo/eicaaarmdb2.html * SAS (software) supports ARM 2.0 since long.

Playing career A centre-forward, Baker was a member of the famous Wallsend Boys Club as a youngster, and was subsequently spotted playing for Bishop Auckland, turning professional with Southampton in June 1984 at a cost of ¬£4,000 to the south coast side. He failed to break into the first-team at Southampton, moving on a free transfer to Carlisle United on 2 July 1985. On 31 July 1987, after 71 league appearances (11 goals) for Carlisle, Baker moved to Hartlepool United, again on a free transfer, where he played 197 games (scoring 67 goals) and was a vital part of the squad that achieved promotion in 1990‚Äì91, forming a partnership with Joe Allon. Baker moved north of the border to join Motherwell in August 1992 for ¬£77,500. After only 9 games at Motherwell, he moved on to Gillingham on 7 January 1993 for a fee of ¬£40,000. During his time at Priestfield he scored one of the goals in a 2‚Äì0 win over Halifax Town which secured the club's League status on the last day of the season. An overall tally of 16 goals in 62 games for the Kent side prompted York City to take him back north, this time for a fee of ¬£15,000 in October 1994. Baker was on the bench for York when they beat Manchester United 3‚Äì0 at Old Trafford in the League Cup in 1995, where he was eventually brought on, lasting a mere seven minutes before being sent off for a second bookable offence. After 48 games (18 goals) for the Bootham Crescent side, he moved to Torquay United on 19 January 1996 for a fee of ¬£25,000. Whilst he had settled in on the playing side, he wanted a move to the north of England and after almost joining Rochdale, who couldn't meet his wage demands, he moved to Scunthorpe United on 3 October 1996 for ¬£15,000. He had made 30 league appearances, scoring 8 goals. His stay at Scunthorpe was also a short one, and on 27 March 1997, after 21 league appearances in which he scored 9 goals, he moved back to Hartlepool United, as player-coach. Another 35 league games followed, in which he scored 9 goals. In the 1998 close season he declined an offer to become Torquay's player/manager, and once Mick Tait was sacked as Hartlepool manager in January 1999, his time at Victoria Park looked to be drawing to a close. He even went on trial at Plymouth Argyle in February 1999, playing for Argyle reserves in their 3‚Äì2 win over Swansea City at Home Park in the South West Trophy on the 16th of that month. His lack of match fitness, after 2 broken legs and a fractured ankle in the previous 2 years, seemed to be Kevin Hodges' main reason for not signing him for Argyle. Baker returned to Hartlepool, playing for their reserve side on 17 February, one night after playing at the opposite end of the country. His desire to play first-team football was eventually rewarded when he was surprisingly recalled to Hartlepool's first- team squad for the rest of the season, often being used as a late substitute. In the close-season of 1999, Baker was released by Hartlepool and looked like dropping down to the Conference after an extended trial period with newly relegated Scarborough. However, on 27 August 1999, Baker signed for Carlisle United, making 17 league appearances (2 goals) until he was released the following summer. In July 2000, he signed for Northern League side Bedlington Terriers, later moving to Durham City in January 2001 in exchange for former England U-18 goalkeeper Adam Clementson. He left Durham in November 2001 to join Blyth Spartans.Blyth turn to veteran Baker Managerial career In November 2002 Baker became manager of Blyth Spartans,Baker gets Blyth job leaving in September 2004Baker quits Blyth..... and has also worked at Newcastle United's academy.

It was first broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 29 February 1988. Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye. The story revolves around Lister's desire to bring his one true love, Kristine Kochanski, back as a hologram. Considered to be one of the weakest from the first series,Episode Survey Results, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, the episode was re-mastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998. This was an attempt to change the standard of the episode suitable for international broadcast. Plot Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) seeks to keep the ship \\"spick and span\\" and arranges for Dave Lister (Craig Charles) to be obedient by having his cigarettes confiscated; when Cat (Danny John-Jules) finds them, Rimmer offers him a deal to return them in exchange for getting all the fish he wants from the food dispensers.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 47. However, Lister refuses to let this get to him, instead wondering why he could not be with a hologram of his true love Kristine Kochanski (Clare Grogan). When he questions Holly (Norman Lovett) over his decision to revive Rimmer and not anyone else, particularly Kochanski or one of his drinking buddies, the computer explains that Rimmer was considered by him to be the best to keep Lister sane. Regardless of Holly's answer, Lister demands Rimmer to let him have Kochanski as a hologram for a few hours. Rimmer refuses his request leading to an argument between the pair, which prompts Lister to declare his intention to outrank him by passing his exams. Rimmer naturally assumes he plans to pass the Astronavigation Exam, which Lister and himself have failed before. He soon discovers that Lister seeks to pass the chef's exam, which is much easier and will still allow him to outrank Rimmer. Rimmer gets increasingly nervous when Lister appears to be doing well with his study prodding a cake and other foods quite well. Rimmer realises Lister may pass, so to prevent this, Rimmer corrupts his image to appear and sound like Kochanski and convince him that she wouldn't be interested in someone like Lister, but fails when he acts out of character. Once the exam results come in, Rimmer nervously asks how he did, to which Lister smugly implies that he passed, refusing to show off his results.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 48. Production The story was written as pure sitcom at the request from the BBC who didn't want the show to be too heavy on science fiction elements. Episode Guide: Series 1 episode 2: Balance Of Power, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, Lister's disco music, \\"Fakin'\\", was by Motor City Diva and Danny John-Jules. Returning Red Dwarf crew members, and Lister's drinking buddies, included Paul Bradley as Chen, David Gillespie as Selby and Mark Williams as Peterson. Clare Grogan also returned as Kochanski. Reception \\"Balance of Power\\" was originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 28 February 1988 in the 9:00pm evening time slot. Although the pilot episode \\"The End\\" drew in over five million viewers, this figure was now tailing off slightly as the series progressed.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 8-9. The episode was considered by Red Dwarf Smegazine readers to be one of the weakest from the first series, coming last in a readers poll with 0.1% of the votes. Remastering The remastering of Series I to III was carried out during the late 1990s. Changes throughout the series included replacement of the opening credits, giving the picture a colour grade and filmising, computer generated special effects of Red Dwarf and many more visual and audio enhancements. Changes specific to \\"Balance of Power\\" include a new shot of Lister riding his bike down the ship's corridor, new re-shot scenes with new dialogue from Holly, pieces of dialogue removed entailing the 'black card' situation lines. A music cue has been added to scenes of Rimmer, when using Kochanksi's hologramatic body, trying to distract Lister during his chef's exam. Also, certain shots and some inconsistent dialogue have been removed from the same scene.

Currently, this field is rapidly expanding due to the dramatic decrease in the cost of sequencing genomes. The study of stem cell genomics has wide reaching implications in the study of stem cell biology and possible therapeutic usages of stem cells. Application of research in this field could lead to drug discovery and information on diseases by the molecular characterization of the pluripotent stem cell through DNA and transcriptome sequencing and looking at the epigenetic changes of stem cells and subsequent products. One step in that process is single cell phenotypic analysis, and the connection between the phenotype and genotype of specific stem cells. While current genomic screens are done with entire populations of cells, focusing in on a single stem cell will help determine specific signaling activity associated with varying degrees of stem cell differentiation and limit background due to heterogeneous populations.DeWitt, N. D., Yaffe, M. P., & Trounson, A. (2012). Building stem- cell genomics in California and beyond. Nature Publishing Group, 30(1), 20‚Äì25. Single cell analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or stem cells able to differentiate into many different cell types, is a suggested method for treating such diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This includes for understanding the differences between sporadic AD and familial AD. By first taking a skin sample from the patient and are transformed by transducing cells using retroviruses to encode such stem cell genes as Oct4, Sox2, KLF4 and cMYC. This allows for skin cells to be reprogrammed into patient-specific stem cell lines.Israel, M. A., & Goldstein, L. S. (2011). Capturing Alzheimer's disease genomes with induced pluripotent stem cells: prospects and challenges, 1‚Äì11. Taking genomic sequences of these individual cells would allow for patient-specific treatments and furthering understanding of AD disease models. This technique would be used for similar diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These stem cells developed from a singular patient would also be able to be used to produce cells affected in the above-mentioned diseases. As mentioned, it will also lead to patient specific phenotypes of each disease. Further chemical analyses to develop safer drugs can be done through sequence information and cell-culture tests on iPSCs. After development on a specific drug, it can be transferred to other patient diseased cells while also being safety tested.Rubin, L. L., & Haston, K. M. (2011). Stem cell biology and drug discovery. BMC Biology, 9(1), 42. Included in the study of stem cell genomics, is epigenomics, genomic-scale studies on chromatin regulatory variation. These studies also hope to expand research into regenerative medicine models and stem cell differentiation. Cell-type specific gene expression patterns during development occur as the result of interactions the chromatin level. Stem cell epigenomics focuses in on the epigenetic plasticity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This includes investigation into bivalent domains as promoters or chromatin regions that are modified by transcriptional initiation and related to gene silencing. They are also looking at the differences between active versus poised enhancers or enhancers that specifically control signaling-dependent gene regulation. Active enhancers are marked by acetylation of histone H3-H3K27ac and while poised are instead methylated at H3K27me3. Stem cell epigenomic studies are also looking into DNA methylation patterns, specifically characteristics of hydroxy methylation versus overall methylation and the difference between methylation of CpG-island rich and CpG poor promoters. It has been found in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) that implanted mESC took up similar characteristics of histone methylation of the embryos where they transplanted into, indicating that methylation may be indicative of environment. This will guide studies into the differences between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells. These studies hope to produce information on iPSC differentiation capacity by first needing to enhance chromatin signature reading. It also hopes to produce to look into regulatory factors that control human embryonic development.Rada-Iglesias, A., & Wysocka, J. (2011). Epigenomics of human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells: insights into pluripotency and implications for disease, 1‚Äì13.

It was first published in 1865. The novel has been adapted into several films. Plot introduction The story revolves around the relationship between the Tabajara indigenous woman, Iracema, and the Portuguese colonist, Martim, who was allied with the Tabajara nation's enemies, the Pitiguaras. Through the novel, Alencar tries to remake the history of the Brazilian colonial state of Cear√°, with Moacir, the son of Iracema and Martim, as the first true Brazilian in Cear√°. This pure Brazilian is born from the love of the natural, innocence (Iracema), culture and knowledge (Martim), and also represents the mixture (miscegenation) of the native race with the European race to produce a new caboclo race. =Explanation of the novel's title= Iracema is Guarani language for honey- lips, from ira - honey, and tembe - lips. Tembe changed to ceme, as in the word ceme iba, according to the author. \\"Iracema\\" is also an anagram of \\"America\\", noted by critics as befitting the allegorization of colonization of America by Europeans, the novel's main theme. Characters in Iracema *Andira: Araqu√©m's brother. Old warrior and hero of his people. *Araqu√©m: Iracema's father. Spiritual leader of the Tabajara's nation. *Batuiret√©: Poti's grandfather *Caubi: Iracema's brother *Iracema: Araqu√©m's daughter. She is the beautiful Tabajara woman with honey-lips and dark hair. *Irapu√£: The warrior leader of the Tabajara nation. *Jaca√∫na: Poti's brother. *Jatob√°: Poti's father. He is an important veteran warrior of the Pitiguara's nation. *Martim: Portuguese colonist. Named in honor of Mars, the Roman god of war. *Moacir: The child of Martim and Iracema. *Poti: Martim's friend and the Pitiguara warrior who is brother of the Pitiguara leader. Iracema and the Indianist Novels Iracema, along with the novels O Guarani and Ubirajara, portrays one of the stages of the formation of the Brazilian ethnic and cultural heritage. Iracema symbolizes the initial meeting between the white man (Europeans) and the natives. \\"Moacir\\" means \\"Son of Pain\\", which is related to his birth, alone with his mother, who was abandoned by Martim for some time when he had to go and help the Potiguaras in a tribal war against the Tabajaras.

Most notably, in 1917 it was adapted as a Brazilian silent film directed by Vittorio Capellaro and starring Iracema de Alencar, and in 1949 as a Brazilian film directed by Vittorio Cardineli and Gino Talamo, starring Ilka Soares. A more modern adaptation is the 1975 film Iracema: Uma Transa Amaz√¥nica directed by Jorge Bodansky and Orlando Senna, which was screened at the International Critics' Week of the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.

The dolls are generally made of natural fibers ‚Äî such as wool, cotton, or linen ‚Äî from their stuffing to their hair to their clothing. The doll makers use techniques drawing on traditional European doll-making. The doll's appearance is intentionally simple in order to allow the child playing with it to develop the imagination and creative play. For instance, it has either no facial features, or a simple neutral expression. The legs and arms are soft and if flexible allow natural postures. They are ideally entirely natural. Dolls vary in the form best suited to the stage of development of the child; from a simple sack or pillow doll for a baby, a knotted or handkerchief style for a teething child, a simple doll with bulky limbs and either short hair or a hat for a toddler. For an older, more independent child who can change clothing and dress hair, 'formed' limbed dolls with the ability to sit are introduced with changeable clothing and often longer hair. Typically, hair on a Waldorf doll is made of pure wool such as mohair or boucle, ply wool or cotton. Facial feature details on a Waldorf doll vary with the maker and are generally simple stitches, sometimes painted, but are always a simple suggestion and ideally neutral, so the child can imagine the personality and mood of the doll and whether the doll is awake or asleep. Some Waldorf dolls have small suggestions of noses. Skin, eye and mouth colors vary with each doll, ideally to reflect the colouring of the child for a first doll.

(NASDAQ: UNCL). Incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 2, 2000, MyRichUncle entered the student lending market as an originator and holder of private student loans. By 2007, the company was listed on the NASDAQ composite and expanded into holding Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. MyRichUncle was one of the first companies to use credit algorithms, combined with traditional credit scoring, to determine the terms a student's loan would carry. These proprietary analytic models and decision tools were positioned as a ‚Äúhuman capital investment‚Äù approach to underwriting student loans. In 2007, MyRichUncle ran a New York Times advertising campaign that publicized the practice of financial aid offices having relationships with student loan companies. New York Attorney General, Andrew M. Cuomo, launched an investigation into deceptive marketing practices in the student loan industry shortly thereafter, the result of which was a marketing code of conduct that eight lenders (Campus Door, EduCap, GMAC Bank, Graduate Loan Associates, Nelnet, NextStudent, Xanthus Financial Services, and MyRichUncle) agreed to follow. Between May 2005 and September 2008, MRU Holdings originated over $550 million in student loans and became one of the largest providers of private student loans, behind top lenders such as Sallie Mae, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. On February 9, 2009, MRU Holdings, the parent holding company of MyRichUncle, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and suspended all its operations. History MyRichUncle co-founders, Raza Khan and Vishal Garg, met at Stuyvesant High School in New York City and attended New York University together. In June 1999, Khan and Garg incorporated Iempower Inc., planning to enable investors to purchase an economic share of an individual's future income stream for a set amount of time. As they developed their business, they found that their original concept had significant crossover potential in the education financing market. Students, who have a large, recurring need for financing their immediate education expenditures, typically do not own any assets other than the potential future stream of cash flows they will receive as a result of their education. However, these education endeavors could be used to predict future income, which in turn, could be used to underwrite student loans. This concept was originally proposed by Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman in his paper, ‚ÄúIncome from Independent Professional Practice,‚Äù as the optimal means of financing education.https://www.nber.org/chapters/c2325.html Further work by Nobel Laureates Gary Becker and James Tobin validated the concept and its applicability to education finance. In May 2001, the founders launched www.myrichuncle.com, Iempower's consumer-facing brand. Through this website, investors could defray a student's undergraduate or graduate degree expenses in exchange for a fixed percentage of that student's future income for a set period after graduation. In order to decide how to allocate investor financing to students and at what rates, Iempower built a proprietary data model which used historical data going as far back as the 1960s to predict the future income and career prospects of each student based upon a variety of academic and credit factors. MyRichUncle received a tremendous amount of positive press and attention for its innovative and transformational business model \\"Banking on Someone Else‚Äôs Education: Financial Times, Feb 08, 2002\\" and over the course of 2001, the founders successfully raised $3 million to invest in students through programs such as the Robertson Education Empowerment Fund and the Education Investment Fund LLC, among others. Iempower suffered a tragic setback in 2001 when the company's offices, located on the 78th floor of 1 WTC, were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. The company's recovery was later profiled by Entrepreneur magazine. In the following years, MyRichUncle rebuilt and demand for MyRichUncle's Education Investment product grew to the point that it significantly exceeded the investment capacity of the company. Around that time, the founders began to notice that a significant number of its Education Investment applicants also had private student loans, which, at the time, was the fastest growing segment of consumer finance.https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/paying- for-college/2008/02/28/student-loans-feel-the-pinch.html MyRichUncle decided to apply its existing, highly relevant underwriting platform to the private student loan industry to achieve a competitive advantage through its advanced analytics and income prediction models. In Khan's words, they ‚Äúwanted to finance students in a variety of innovative ways.‚Äùhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1145202/000114420404010011/v04555_8k.txt.html Entry into the private student loan business, which was traditionally the mainstay of large banks and Sallie Mae, required the company to raise significant amounts of external capital. In July 2004, Iempower, with an equity capital raise of $4.2 million, entered into a reverse public merger with Pacific Technologies, a publicly traded company. Upon completion of the takeover, Iempower Inc. changed its name to ‚ÄúMRU Holdings, Inc.‚Äùhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1145202/000114420406000716/form8k.txt.html In February 2005, MRU Holdings obtained a $165 million credit facility, expandable to $300 million, for funding private student loans from Nomura Credit and Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest investment bank. In May 2005, MRU Holdings began offering private student loans under the brand name ‚ÄúMyRichUncle.‚Äù In January 2006, MRU Holdings obtained a $175 million credit facility with Merrill Lynch Bank USA and also closed a $29 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) offering with Merrill Lynch Private Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, Lehman Brothers, and several senior MBNA executives.http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi- bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY;=/www/story/04-18-2006/0004342022.html These investments allowed MyRichUncle to continue to develop its innovative product line to meet the needs of an ever-larger population of loan-seeking students. MRU was convinced that students without a sufficient credit history or credit worthy co-signer, but with demonstrable academic and income potential, should be eligible to receive education financing, and began revisiting its original human capital investment concept, ‚ÄúIempower.‚Äù MRU used its groundbreaking research on future income potential to create a new loan product called ‚ÄúPrePrime.‚Äù PrePrime loans were underwritten based upon a student's academic qualificationshttp://www.filife.com/stories/loans-for-students-who-lack- credit-history.html rather than the traditional credit criteria, which many students do not have enough history of. In May 2006, MRU introduced its PrePrime product to the market after raising investment funds through a consortium of European investors.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1113668/000095012307002474/y30635e8vk.htm.html MRU announced this product as the first of its kind stating that it ‚Äúput the ‚Äòstudent‚Äô back into the student lending equation.‚Äù By April 27, 2007, MRU was able to expand its ability to originate PrePrime loans by securing a $100 million credit facility from Germany's fifth-largest bank,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1113668/000095012307002474/y30635e8vk.html DZ Bank. In June 2006, MyRichUncle introduced its federal loan program as a complement to its private student loan products. Aiming to level the playing field with incumbent originators, MyRichUncle took this opportunity to attract new borrowers by offering discounted rates on Stafford and PLUS loans, setting fixed rates of 5.8% and 6.75%, respectively.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1145202/000114420406043630/v055595_8k.html These rates were significantly lower than the Federal Government interest rate maximums of 6.8% for Stafford loans and 8.5% for PLUS loans (from July 1, 2006, onward). In October 2006, MRU Holdings was listed on NASDAQ under the symbol UNCL.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/07/9999999997-07-046696.html The company had a market capitalization of over $200 million. In 2007, MRU Holdings entered into several acquisitions and partnership deals in order to enhance its product offering. MRU Holdings purchased Embark Corp. on February 12, 2007, from The Princeton Review.http://www.statravel.com/cps/rde/xchg/us_division_web_live/hs.xsl/8759.htm.html Embark provides online admissions applications and enrollment management services to colleges and universities, and to a number of other institutions, foundations, and scholarship and fellowship programs. In March 2007, one month after the Embark purchase, MRU Holdings announced a partnership with STA Travel to provide travel loans for study abroad students.http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi- bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY;=/www/story/04-11-2007/0004563321.html In April 2007, MRU Holdings announced an exclusive marketing partnership with The Princeton Review. In June 2007, MRU Holdings closed its first securitization transaction (2007-A), issuing $200 million in principal amount of asset-backed securities through Merrill Lynch & Co.. Of the $200 million in bonds issued, $165 million of the bonds were rated AAA, with a $21.5 million tranche rated A, and a $13 million tranche rated BB by Standard & Poor's and Moody's. The issue had a number of innovative features, including the first issuance of BB- rated securities in a private student loan securitization transaction, and the first time a new issuer transaction was able to receive premium proceeds. MRU's 2007-A trust significantly out-performed similar trusts from Sallie Mae and FMD private loan offerings and began to establish MRU as the preeminent underwriter of high credit quality private student loan assets.http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1866589/.html To continue to meet the growing demand for student loans, MRU Holdings continued to look for additional funding. In November 2007, MRU Holdings secured an additional $200 million credit facility from DZ Bank. In July 2008, MRU Holdings closed its second securitization, issuing $140 million in principal amount of asset-backed securities through Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs & Co. and BB&T; Capital Markets. The securitization was the only student loan securitization transaction completed in nine months and was completed at a time when deals from larger issuers such as Sallie Mae and First Marblehead were rumored to be in the market, but unable to be completed.http://studentlendinganalytics.typepad.com/student_lending_analytics/2008/07/market- buzz-770.html.htmlhttp://www.fool.com/news/associated-press/2008/07/07/mru- holdings-prices-140-million-securitization.aspx.html Between May 2005 and September 2008, MRU Holdings originated over $550 million in student loans. However, despite its successes, the company was forced to cease further loan origination on September 8, 2008 due to the financial crisis and the increasingly limited supply of capital for making new loans from MRU's lenders, some of the largest investment banks in the world. As a result of the worsening crisis, on February 9, 2009, MRU Holdings, Inc., the parent holding company of MyRichUncle, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and suspended all its operations. 2007 student lending scandal As a lender, MyRichUncle took an activist role in the student loan industry, critical of the relationships between many financial aid offices and incumbent lenders. In 2006, MyRichUncle drew attention for publishing a New York Times advertisement questioning financial aid administrators practice of taking \\"kickbacks\\" from lenders in exchange for a place on their \\"preferred lender\\" lists. This ‚Äúpayola‚Äù or ‚Äúpay- to-play‚Äù system, which was later confirmed in the press, saw lenders pay financial aid offices for leading students to take loans out from them. The MyRichUncle campaign pointed out that these deceptive practices on the part of financial aid offices and lenders were resulting in higher interest rates for students and a lack of transparency for students into available education financing options. In January 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began an investigation to uncover relationships between schools and lenders. MyRichUncle's campaign is often cited as a catalyst in initiating the attorney general's investigation of student lending practices. On March 15, 2007 the New York Attorney General released a summary of the investigation's early findings: ‚ÄúThere is an unholy alliance between banks and institutions of higher education that may often not be in the students‚Äô best interest,‚Äù Andrew Cuomo said in a news release. ‚ÄúThe financial arrangements between lenders and these schools are filled with the potential for conflicts of interest. In some cases they may even break the law.‚Äù The following month, on April 4, 2007, the New York Attorney General released another statement: \\"We are seeing more and more suspicious practices and dealings between university officers and loan companies come to light....This creates even more questions about the integrity of the student loan industry and the process by which colleges steer students to loans.\\" As the scandal unfolded, MyRichUncle took the opportunity to distinguish itself from other lenders and started to market itself as the ‚Äúconflict-free‚Äù alternative. MyRichUncle was attacked in the press by the established industry players. However, between March and May 2007, a number of related stories made it to press, confirming MyRichUncle's allegations of systemic misconduct in the student loan industry. * In March 2007, it came to light that certain lenders were operating call centers providing financial advice for students where company employees would, in some cases, identify themselves as university advisers. Nelnet was found to be operating a call center supporting ten different universities (including Texas Tech and Wayne State University). Sallie Mae was identified as operating call centers supporting approximately twenty different institutions including Pace University, Mercy College, and Seton Hall University. * On April 11, 2007, Sallie Mae agreed to pay $2 million into a fund to educate college-bound students as part of a settlement with the New York Attorney General. The lender also agreed to no longer pay for travel and expenses for university officials, provide unpaid staffing assistance to financial aid offices, or operate call centers that provide financial advice for students where company employees identify themselves as university advisers. * In April 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced that his office would sue Drexel University. According to Cuomo's investigation, Drexel received over $124,000 from revenue sharing agreements with Education Finance Partners (EFP) and had accrued an additional $126,000 through March 2007. Since 2005, Drexel had sent over $16 million in loan volume to EFP as part of its preferred lender list. * More than 60 colleges had \\"revenue sharing\\" agreements with Education Finance Partners.http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=x58hqp5dmf9bs9zkkzzt3bf5514c5092.html JP Morgan Chase was found to have spent $74,000 to ‚Äúwine and dine‚Äù student loan officials from more than 200 colleges on board a Manhattan cruise ship in 2005. Additionally, the bank was shown to have employed five university loan officers while they still held positions at their respective colleges. * At the University of Texas‚Äô Office of Student Financial Services, lenders were found to have provided gifts such as steakhouse dinners and ice cream carts in the hope of obtaining a place on the University's preferred lender list.http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2.4489/gifts-were-factored-into-ut-s- ranking-of-preferred-lenders-1.958490.html In one article, it was revealed that the financial aid office was alleged to have used ‚Äú‚Äòtreats‚Äô as a unit of measurement in preferred -lender list analyses.‚Äù * Columbia University fired its Financial Aid Director (David Charlow) after it was discovered that he held a financial interest in a student loan provider, ‚ÄúStudent Loan Xpress,‚Äù that he promoted to parents and university alumni. Mr. Charlow had received 7,500 stock options from the lender. In 2005, it was discovered that he earned a total of more than $100,000 from all the sales. Student Loan Xpress was put on Columbia's preferred lender list in 2005. A Columbia spokesman stated that Mr. Charlow had ‚Äúabused a position of trust and violated the university policy on conflicts of interest.‚Äù * A Senate Report was released, detailing many of the unethical and deceptive practices occurring between financial aid offices and universities. One of the examples in the report describes how Nelnet, a lender based in Nebraska, created an elaborate point system to reward college officials who advised it. Contributing an idea for a product earned 25 credits. Completing an online survey won another twenty-five credits. The credits could be redeemed for donations to an alma mater or college/university of choice. Each was good for $1. Results of the investigation As a result of the corrupt practices revealed within the student lending industry, over $3 million was refunded to students and an additional $13.7 million was allocated to the National Education Fund[A4]. This fund was established by the New York Attorney General to help educate students on navigating the lending industry. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo also created a student lending Code of Conduct. This eventually became New York State law as the Student Lending Accountability, Transparency, and Enforcement (SLATE) Act of 2007. The SLATE Act contains guidelines and prohibitions regarding revenue sharing, gifts and trips, advisory board compensation, preferred lender lists, loan resale disclosures, and call center operations. On the federal level, the Student Loan Sunshine Act was passed in May 2007 which included provisions banning gifts, perks, and revenue-sharing agreements between lenders and schools. Additionally, it requires institutions to disclose all relationships with lenders and ensure that students have access to all lenders of their choice, including those not on the \\"Preferred Lender Lists.‚Äù Recognition *MyRichUncle was listed as number 16 among Fast Company's 2006 \\"Fast 50.\\" *Raza Khan and Vishal Garg, co-founders, were featured as BusinessWeek's \\"Tech's Best Young Entrepreneurs.\\" *MyRichUncle is featured in Footing The Tuition Bill: The New Student Loan Sector, edited by Frederick M.

Bankruptcy  On February 9, 2009, MRU filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation and suspended all operations.

Life and work Rabbi Hillman was born in Kovno, Lithuania, the son of Paya Rivka and Avraham Chaim Hillman. In his youth, he studied Torah under his uncles, Rabbi Mordechai Hillman, av beth din of Pasvatin, and Rabbi Noach Yaakov Hillman of Pasval. After his marriage, he studied intensively by himself in the house of his father-in-law, Rabbi Yitzchak Hirsch in the town of Franks in Kurland. Rabbi Hillman received semicha from the famous Rabbis Eliyahu Dovid Teumim (who was the chief rabbi in Ponevezh and afterwards served in Jerusalem), Refael Shapiro of Volozhin, Meir Simcha HaKohen of Dvinsk and the Ridvaz of Slutsk. In 1897, when Rabbi Hillman was 29 years old, he became rabbi and head of the Beth Din of Berazino in the Minsk Region of then-Russia, an old and distinguished community that had been graced with many great rabbis in the past. In 1908, he was appointed rabbi in Glasgow, serving and founding the Beth Din there until 1914, when he was appointed a dayan of the London Beth Din. After retiring from the London Beth Din in 1934, Dayan Hillman settled in Jerusalem, devoting himself to study and writing. He co-founded the Jerusalem yeshiva Ohel Torah together with his son- in-law Chief Rabbi of Israel Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, and served as its rosh yeshiva. His grandson was Israeli President Chaim Herzog, and his great- grandson is politician Isaac Herzog. Lineage Rabbi Hillman was a descendant of his namesake Rabbi Shmuel Hillman (Helman), the Av Beth Din of Metz, who is mentioned in the introduction to the responsa Noda Bihudah. On his mother's side, he was a descendant of Rabbi Michal Datnover, who was known in his time as an exceptional scholar and Kabbalist. In addition, Rabbi Hillman was a direct sixth-generation descendant of the author of Knesses Yechezkel, who was the Av Beth Din of Altona, Hamburg and Wandsbek. He also descended from the Katzenellenbogen family, and could trace his lineage back to the Maharam (Rabbi Meir ben Isaac) of Padua and Rabbi Yehuda Mintz. Death Rabbi Hillman died in Jerusalem in 1953. Thousands of people followed his funeral through the streets of Jerusalem, among them Cabinet ministers, Members of the Knesset, and leading rabbis and rosh yeshivas. Dayan Hillman's death caused deep sorrow in Jerusalem, where he was greatly beloved. Eulogies were delivered by the deceased's son-in-law Chief Rabbi Herzog, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer (with whom Dayan Hillman learned with in the Volozhin yeshiva), the Minister of Religious Affairs Mr Moshe Shapira, and others. He was survived by his wife; his daughter Sarah, the wife of Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog; and his son David Hillman, a London artist. Soon after Dayan Hillman died, a memorial service was held in London, where Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie and Dayan Yehezkel Abramsky spoke, full of praise, respect and admiration for the deceased. Dayan Lazarus, Dayan Grunfeld, Dayan Grossnass and Rabbi Isidore Epstein were among those in attendance. Works Dayan Hillman authored many scholarly works, including a 20-volume commentary on every tractate of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, as well as on the Mishnaic Orders Zeraim and Taharos and on the Rambam and Sifra, entitled Or Hayashar (London, Jerusalem). He also published novellae on the Tanakh and a book of his sermons and orations. Among the other writings of this outstanding figure were manuscripts on the Talmudic tractates Zevachim, Arakhin and Temura‚Äîall in the Order of Kodshim‚Äîand responsa on all four sections of the Shulchan Aruch.

Arizona, 548 U.S. 735 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the insanity defense used by Arizona. The Court affirmed the murder conviction of a man with paranoid schizophrenia for killing a police officer. The man had argued that his inability to understand the nature of his acts at the time that they were committed should be a sufficient basis for showing that he lacked the requisite mental state required as an element of the charged crime. The Court upheld Arizona's restriction of admissible mental health evidence only to the issue of insanity and not to show that the defendant did not possess the required mental intent level necessary to satisfy an element of the crime. Evidence is admissible only to show that the defendant was insane at the time of the crime's commission. In this case, the defendant knew right from wrong and so he could not qualify under Arizona's insanity defense.  Background  The constitutionality of an insanity defense was questioned as well as whether a defendant has a Fourteenth Amendment due process right, unrelated to the insanity plea, to present the correct evidence on the mental state to counter the prosecution's evidence of criminal intent. In the case, Eric Clark shot and killed a police officer at a traffic stop because he believed his town in Arizona had been taken over by aliens. Clark, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and used the insanity defense to try to use his mental disorder as an excuse for the crime that he had committed. The court did not believe that Clark's insanity defense was a justifiable defense and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Throughout the court case, Clark presented an elaborate testimony describing his odd behavior a year prior to the incident. Among many other things, Clark believed that \\"aliens\\", some being government employees, were trying to hurt and kill him and that the only way to stop them was through death. A psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in which a patient has delusions that a person is against the patient and/or family. The psychiatrist said that at the time of the shooting, Clark was incapable of deciding right from wrong and so was insane. Before being tried again, he was committed to a mental institution for two years, and his belief in aliens was still present afterward, but he believed that they were no longer out to get him but had another mission.  Decision  In a 5-4 decision, in favor of Arizona, the US Supreme Court decided that the Arizona court could limit the amount of evidence used to plea a person's sanity for a defendant's insanity defense.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 223 (2006). Justice Souter believes that having a defendant prove his insanity in order to justify they were unable to clearly think while committing the crime would disprove his claim for insanity because they were able to think clearly to prove they were insane. The court cited the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in State v. Mott, which refused to allow a psychiatric testimony to invalidate a criminal's intent and to uphold that Arizona does not allow evidence of a mental illness to neutralize the mens rea of a crime. Mens Rea is an element of criminal responsibility regarding whether or not there was intention or knowledge of wrongdoing while a crime was being committed. The court also determined that due process does not require a State to use both areas of the M'Naughten insanity test. Rather, a State may adopt an insanity test that focuses solely on moral incapacity.  Dissenting opinions  Judges Ginsburg, Kennedy, and Stevens disagreed with the majority ruling of the court. Justice Breyer partially concurred and agreed with the Court's \\"basic categorization\\" of evidence related to insanity. Further, he acknowledged that a State may provide consideration of mental-disease \\"solely in conjunction with the insanity defense.\\" However, he dissented from the majority's opinion and would change the case so that Arizona courts could determine whether state law is consistent. In dissent, Justice Kennedy stated that it was not necessary for him to address Clark's due process challenge to Arizona's insanity test. Instead, he disagreed with the majority for limiting Clark's claim to evidentiary support on his insanity. He also believed the Mott Rule, which does not allow evidence for insanity to prove someone is not guilty, to be unjust in the case as it is an exclusion of evidence, despite its credibility.  Controversy  There was no controversy that Clark was schizophrenic and was suffering from the disease when he shot Officer Moritz. There was no controversy either that Clark actually believed that there were aliens who were out to get him, as he hung fishing line in his room as \\"booby traps\\" as well as wind chimes on the doors and windows to warn him of intruders. Lastly, Clark kept a bird in his car to warn him of different changes in air temperature, which he believed could lead to possible intruders. There is some controversy on the reasons for Clark's actions on the night of the crime. For example, he was playing music in his car at high volume. The state believed that the music was meant to lure the officer to his vehicle with a nuisance offense, as Clark had mentioned to a friend that he wanted to shoot a cop. The defense expert, Dr. Morentz, dismissed that theory and believed Clark was playing music loudly to \\"drown out\\" the voices in his head, a tactic common among paranoid schizophrenics. The state and the defense began again to agree after he was sent to jail. Clark called the prison guards aliens and refused to eat out of fear of being poisoned by aliens.  Application of insanity laws  Depending on the state, the insanity law places the burden of proof on the prosecution, which must prove that the defendant is not insane, or on the defense, which must prove that the defendant is insane. After the application of the insanity defense began, Jones v. United States permitted people acquitted due to insanity to be held in a mental hospital for a longer time to the one that they would be in prison, depending on the circumstances. The courts also require for the subject in question to be able to withstand a trial or otherwise to be hospitalized until they are able to go to trial. Another way that a case regarding mental illness is handled is the verdict being \\"guilty but mentally ill.\\" Then, the person is given a sentence but is offered psychiatric treatment while incarcerated or is taken to a mental hospital until the person is believed to be capable enough to be taken to a prison to serve the remainder of the sentence. = History = The insanity defense has existed since the 12th century and is one of the most controversial but one of the least used criminal defense strategies. It claims that a criminal defendant should not be found guilty because of the defendant's insanity. A person who is insane is said to lack the understanding of the crime or the difference between right and wrong. Initially, the defense could be used only to pardon a criminal's sentence. The concept that one's insanity could avoid the sentence began in the 19th century in Isaac Ray's The Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity and the English M'Naughton Case. In 1843, Daniel M'Naughton was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and thought that he was being persecuted, causing him to shoot and kill Edward Drummond. He was found not guilty on the grounds that he was insane at the time of his act. The public were outraged by the decision. The rule states that every person is assumed to be sane and that to establish a ground of insanity, it must be proved that at the time of committing a crime, the criminal was acting due to a \\"defect of reason\\" or mental illness, causing a lack of understanding the nature of the act. The rule includes as a test of distinguishing whether or not a defendant can determine the difference between right and wrong. One of the best known applications of the insanity defense was for John W. Hinckley, a man who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1982. He was ultimately acquitted of his charges under the insanity defense. The outrage after the court decision caused four states to eliminate the insanity defense: Montana, Utah, Idaho, and Kansas.

It is the eighth installment in the NBA 2K franchise and the successor to NBA 2K6. It was released in 2006 for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox, and Xbox 360. Shaquille O'Neal of the Miami Heat is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K7 is the predecessor to NBA 2K8 in the NBA 2K series. The game strives to simulate the experience of the National Basketball Association and attempts to be as realistic as possible. Players play NBA basketball games with real life teams in a variety of game modes. Players may customize the gameplay, as well as the players, and can take control of an NBA team as the general manager, hiring coaches, and making a profit. The game features all the main aspects found in the NBA, such as commentary, realistic crowd animations, and halftime shows. The game's overall gameplay, as well as the aesthetics, was said to have been significantly improved before release. NBA 2K7 received a positive reception upon release. A lot of praise was directed at the game's overall presentation; some critics called the visuals \\"gorgeous\\", while others said it was \\"spectacular\\" and achieved great \\"visual feats\\". Most other praise was directed at the game's improved gameplay, as well as the depth and wealth of content. Some negative comments were made concerning the models and animations of the players. Gameplay NBA 2K7 is a basketball simulation game based on the National Basketball Association. Particularly similar to NBA 2K6, NBA 2K7 simulates the experience of the sport of basketball, and more specifically, the experience of the NBA. Players play NBA games with any real life or custom team, in many different game modes, such as quick play or Association. Players customize many aspects of the presentation and gameplay, such as camera angles, and the level of realism. Like past NBA 2K games, NBA 2K7 is marketed as being as realistic as the actual NBA, with all the things featured in NBA games, such as commentary, and mascots. Kevin Harlan is the play-by-play commentator, Kenny Smith is the colour commentator, and Craig Sager is the sideline reporter. Players can create their own players, using a system that has been modified from previous games in the series. Players can then use their player in 'Street' mode, a mode where players do battle against established NBA stars in street ball competitions. On the PlayStation 3, instead of shooting free throws with button presses, players must move the DualShock 3 controller in a way that resembles how free throws are shot in real life. Additionally, if a player is playing against another player, that player can shake their controller, which shakes the screen, in an attempt to distract the free throw shooter. Several online modes are present, including tournaments, and a mode that can support up to ten players, in which each individual player on the court at that time is controlled by a real person. Before release, many of the game's features were said to have been drastically improved. Features that were heavily marketed include the updated visuals, individual player styles and animations, the number of players, which was said to be as large as the NBA's, the new creation tools, and the online modes. Development Shaquille O'Neal, the cover athlete of NBA 2K6, is again the cover athlete of NBA 2K7. Therefore, he and Allen Iverson are the only two players at this point who have appeared on multiple covers of the NBA 2K series. Soundtrack The soundtrack of NBA 2K7 was compiled by Dan the Automator; it features 13 songs. The soundtrack was also released on CD with the title Dan the Automator Presents 2K7. Release NBA 2K7 was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 on September 25, 2006; and for PlayStation 3 on November 13, 2006. This is the first game in the NBA 2K series to be released on the PlayStation 3, and the last to be released on the original Xbox. Reception NBA 2K7 received \\"favorable reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameTrailers was particularly positive towards the PlayStation 3 version's overall presentation and gameplay, with the reviewer saying they enjoyed the menu designs, quick load times, refined control schemes, and player animations. The reviewer also commended the amount of content saying: \\"There‚Äôs so much content that we wish you luck getting through it all before the inevitable NBA 2K8 takes the court.\\" The reviewer summed up the review by saying: \\"While it isn‚Äôt perfect, NBA 2K7 simply offers the most well-rounded, entertaining, and error-free hoops offering this season. Plenty of modes and gameplay depth combine with stunning visuals and presentation to make NBA 2K7 this year‚Äôs king of the court and a must own for PS3-owning hoops fans.\\" Aaron Thomas of GameSpot said of the same console version: \\"When everything comes together, NBA 2K7 looks and feels amazing. Watching a player in the low post receive a bounce pass, pivot one way, take a drop step the other, and finally slam the ball home is truly something to behold. Unfortunately, these instances of perfection aren't as frequent as they could be, given the preponderance of nagging gameplay issues. If you already own the game on the Xbox 360, there's no reason to pick it up again on the PlayStation 3. However, if you're looking for a great, well-rounded basketball game for your new PlayStation 3, you'll be pleased with NBA 2K7.\\" IGN's Jonathan Miller said of the U.S. Xbox 360 version: \\"NBA 2K7 is a very impressive basketball title. The critically acclaimed gameplay has been improved, especially the defensive AI, yet other areas like defense still need some work. This game is as deep as sports games go, offering not only a great franchise mode but a wealth of options you may never even see. There are so many options that the game is great for hardcore simulation fans and arcade streetball fans alike. If you like basketball, you can't help but enjoy NBA 2K7. Moving forward, 2K needs to make player faces look like human beings, improve some suspect clock AI on the part of the CPU, and work on making on-the-ball defense fun. Still, this is a damn good basketball game and your best option on the 360 this season.\\" Mike Reilly of Game Revolution praised the Xbox 360 version's visuals, gameplay, depth, game modes, sound, online features, and realistic animations, but criticized the menus, calling them \\"Confusing\\". \\"NBA 2K7 is a pleasure to play, or just watch,\\" Reilly said. \\"The load of modes and options will keep you easily entertained until next season, and the new animations and context- sensitive controls add a never-before-seen layer of realism, even if you have seen everything else before. If you have the cash, this is an easy bucket.\\" Matt Martin of Eurogamer said of the same console version: \\"It's deep baby, deeper than The Bee Gees' and Take That's love. It's handsome too. Damn handsome. And it's rich with features, so rich you'll struggle to know where to start, and then have to face up to the possibility that you won't ever get around to exploring everything. It's a sports game that will keep you going for months until the next one arrives, and even then it's going to do itself a disservice by making you seriously question whether you need to buy another yearly upgrade. But if this is the sport you're dedicated to, Visual Concepts has made the game entirely for your pleasure. And it's not very often you can credit a game with giving you a year's worth of play. Go get it.\\" 1UP.com's Todd Zuniga mostly praised the Xbox 360 version's well rounded features. More specifically, Zuniga complimented the game modes, calling them \\"freakishly deep\\", as well as the aesthetical details, arena designs, crowd movements, and player animations, saying \\"the obscene amount of eye candy will have you overlooking [the] flaws.\\" Zuniga also praised the overall gameplay, calling the attention to detail \\"impressive\\". Zuniga's main criticisms were minor; he found some player faces \\"ugly\\", experienced unfair difficulty spikes while guarding the better players, and disliked the large number of steals that amount during a game. Zuniga wrote: \\"This is clearly the premier basketball game of the year. In fact, when you match up NBA 2K7 bucket for bucket with Live 07, it's a slaughter. We're talking a 120-48 type of lopsidedness.\\" Greg Vallentin of VideoGamer.com said of the same console version: \\"When all is said and done, NBA 2K7 is as well-rounded a basketball game as you can get. 2K7 really isn't a huge improvement over last year's effort, but I doubt anyone will bother to care. Lone players could spend months in the Association mode, and the online options are excellent for players wanting some human-on- human play. At the moment there's only one basketball series worth caring about, and that's NBA 2K.\\" References External links * 2006 video games 2K Sports games Multiplayer and single-player video games 7 PlayStation 2 games PlayStation 3 games Take-Two Interactive games Video games developed in the United States Video games set in 2006 Video games set in 2007 Xbox games Xbox 360 games ","title":"NBA 2K7"},{"id":"5747469","text":"The Strabane Canal is a short (6.5 km) canal in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It connected the market town of Strabane to the navigable River Foyle and from there to the port of Foyle Port on the north coast of Ireland. The canal opened in 1796 and closed in 1962. History The Strabane Canal was conceived by the Marquess of Abercorn as a way of encouraging industrial and commercial development in Strabane and its immediate surroundings, most of which was within his estates. An Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise the construction of the canal, although the land required for the canal was bought by the Marquess's agents by agreement with the owners, and the project, which cost ¬£11,858, was privately funded by the Marquess, assisted by a loan of ¬£3,703 from the Irish Parliament. The canal ran from the tidal waters of Lough Foyle at Leck, some upstream from Derry, to Strabane. It left the Foyle just above its junction with the Burndennet River, to enter Crampsie's Lock. The main water supply was from a stream which entered the canal above Devine's Lock, the only other lock built. Construction began in late 1791, with John Whally of Coleraine acting as engineer, after the plans had been inspected by Richard Owen, then working on the extension of the Lagan Canal from Lisburn to Lough Neagh. Most of the canal was completed within a year, but construction of the locks and the junction with the Foyle took much longer, and was finally finished in 1795. An official opening took place on 21 March 1796, amidst great celebrations. The \\"respectable inhabitants\\" ate at the Abercorn's Arms, and proposed many toasts, while ale was supplied to the general populace, and there were bonfires and illuminations. =Operation= The locks were designed to accommodate sea-going schooners, capable of carrying 300 tons of cargo. Devine's lock was , with of water over the cill, while Campsie's Lock was , with a depth of . Tolls were collected by the Marquess's agents, at a flat rate of two shillings (10p) per ton. An upstream trade in coal, timber, hardware and foodstuffs developed, although there was dissatisfaction with the tolls, which were considered by the merchants to be too high and unreasonable. Traffic from Strabane to Derry developed more slowly, but a trade in agricultural produce gradually increased. Lighters were towed by a steam tug to the entrance of the canal, while horses provided the power for the journey up to Strabane. From 1820, a group of local people leased the canal from the Marquess, and continued to run it successfully. 583 lighters made the journey between Strabane and Derry in 1836, carrying a total of 10,535 tons, most of which was grain. A number of warehouses, grain stores and wharves were built along the banks at Strabane. The canal brought considerable prosperity to Strabane and to Lifford in the first quarter of the nineteenth century and the towns became flourishing markets for agricultural produce. However, in 1847 a railway opened from Derry to Strabane, which was extended to Omagh in 1852, and a network of connecting railways soon developed. The effect on the canal was dramatic, and the canal was soon in financial difficulties. The canal company which had leased the canal for the last 40 years was wound up in 1860, to be replaced by the Strabane Steam Navigation Company. Although traffic remained at about 20,000 tons until the end of the century, this generated between ¬£2,000 and ¬£3,000 of income, and by the time operating costs and the lease were paid, the net annual revenue was always below ¬£300. The new company was also wound up, to be replaced by the Strabane Canal Company in 1890, who took out a 31-year lease at ¬£300 per year. In 1888, the Railway & Canal Traffic Act had made it compulsory for every public company to notify the Board of Trade of their rates and charges. The Board of Trade had powers to set new rates if they did not approve of the existing rates. The Strabane Canal Company argued that it was a private company, and therefore exempt from the Act, while the Duke of Abercorn, who owned the canal, appealed to the House of Lords. Lieutenant-Colonel Addison was duly despatched from the Board of Trade to inspect the canal and the affairs of the company in 1898. Despite local allegations that the canal was unnavigable, and the findings of Addison that the east bank needed to be strengthened, the channel was shallow in places, and the gates needed to be repaired, he ruled that the canal was still navigable. However, the operating company was deemed to be a public company, to whom the 1888 Act applied, and the tonnage rate was reduced to 6d (2.5p) per ton by the Board of Trade, one quarter of the rate that had previously been charged. =Decline= Conditions continued to decline. The water was less than deep along much of the canal, as over of the east bank required repairs to make it watertight, and the lock gates leaked. Shoals and sandbanks had developed in the Foyle below the entrance to the canal, as a result of the failure of the Derry authorities to dredge the channel. Whereas coasters had been able to reach Strabane in the early years of the canal, this was no longer possible, since the construction of the Carlisle Bridge in Derry in the 1860s and a bridge carrying the narrow gauge Donegal Railway over the canal below Strabane Basin. Previously, the only bridges over the canal had been two wooden swing bridges, which allowed the passage of boats with masts or funnels. Despite the fact that lighters could only complete the journey if half full, trade continued, with Smyth's grain mill generating up to half the trade. By the basin, there were two saw mills, a tannery, a brewery and repair shops and docks which were used to service the lighters. A little further down, coal was unloaded to supply the gas works, where a jetty had been built into the canal. When the narrow gauge railway had been opened in 1900, it had been expected to provide competition for the existing line, but in practice, the two companies agreed rates, because the canal was still offering some competition. In 1910, carriage of foodstuffs and manure was still cheaper by water, and the canal basin was much nearer the town centre than the railway station. James McFarland, who had been the principal shareholder in the Canal Company since 1890, died around this time, and the lack of good management led to further decline. In 1912, the canal was bought from the Duke by the Strabane and Foyle Navigation Company Limited. The main shareholder was William Smyth, who owned the mill at Strabane, but despite attempts to improve the navigable depth of the canal, and the acquisition of a steam tug to tow the barges along the canal, traffic did not recover, and ceased in the early 1930s. Attempts were made to abandon the canal from 1944, and the section between Strabane and the swing bridge at Dysert was finally abandoned in 1962. The rest officially remained open. Failed Restoration Attempt In June 2006 the Strabane Lifford Development Commission paid for a ¬£1.3m cross-border waterways restoration contract. The project was launched by President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, in Lifford and intended to restore the 2.4 km (1.5 mi) of canal and two locks to working order. The two sets of locks were restored but the construction work on the canal channel was of a poor standard. The council has refused to maintain the restored section of canal in its present state, and it has begun to deteriorate again.

History Tsakhurs are first mentioned in the 7th-century Armenian and Georgian sources where they are named Tsakhaik. After the conquest of Caucasian Albania by the Arabs, Tsakhurs formed a semi-independent state (later a sultanate) of Tsuketi and southwestern Dagestan. By the 11th century, Tsakhurs who had mostly been Christian, converted to Islam. From the 15th century some began moving south across the mountains to what is now the Zaqatala District of Azerbaijan. In the 18th century the capital of the state moved south from Tsakhur in Dagestan to ƒ∞lisu and came to be called the Elisu Sultanate. West of the Sultanate Tsakhurs formed the Djaro-Belokani free communities. The sultanate was in the sphere of influence of the Shaki Khanate.

It is the follow-up to the 2003 film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. with Sanjay Dutt reprising his role as Munna Bhai, a Mumbai underworld don. In Lage Raho Munna Bhai, the eponymous lead character starts to see the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi. Through his interactions with Gandhi, he begins to practice what he refers to as Gandhigiri (a neologism for Gandhism) to help ordinary people solve their problems. The film won widespread critical acclaim from critics and had a number of prominent screenings. It was a box-office success and received a \\"blockbuster\\" rating by the website Box Office India after grossing over worldwide. It was the recipient of a number of awards, including 4 National Film Awards. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the first Hindi film to be shown at the United Nations, and was screened at the Tous Les Cinema du Monde section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The film popularised the term Gandhigiri. Vidhu Vinod Chopra submitted the film as an independent entry for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. It was later remade in Telugu as Shankar Dada Zindabad (2007).  Plot  Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai is a gangster in love with the voice of Janhavi, a radio jockey. He devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House'. To prepare, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights without food or sleep, Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi. Munna studies so much that Gandhi appears as an hallucination to offer help and advice. Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth to Janhavi, but Munna resists. With Gandhi's help, Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism. Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Janhavi and Gandhi's image, guiding his audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems. Lucky Singh, an unscrupulous businessman, employs Circuit and Munna to conduct underworld activities for him. His daughter Simran is engaged to marry Sunny, the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana. Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer, Batuk Maharaj, whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra \\"K\\" to his real name (Khurana) as well as to the conclusion that the 'Second Innings House' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live. Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a manglik (an individual whose Vedic astrological makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage, mostly leading to the death of the spouse after a certain calculated period of marriage). Lucky tricks Kkhurana by saying that one of his typists had entered the wrong time of birth. Lucky appropriates the 'Second Innings House' by sending Munna, Jahnavi, and the Second Innings senior citizens to Goa and then blackmailing Munna to let the matter pass or risk losing Janhavi. In response, Munna launches a \\"non-violent\\" protest to reclaim the house. He calls this protest \\"Get Well Soon, Lucky\\" and asks his radio show's audience to send Lucky flowers to help him recover from the \\"disease of dishonesty\\". One night Gandhi tells Munna that the only way to stop Lucky is to reveal the truth to Janhavi himself, saying that this will only help in getting his love back if he continues to practice Gandhigiri. Munna asks Gandhi when he can tell Janhavi the truth, and Gandhi tells Munna to tell her the next morning. Munna does so via letter. Heartbroken, Janhavi leaves Munna, and he ends the protest. Later, she decides to quit her job, and Munna decides to continue hosting her radio show all alone to help people practice Gandhigiri, and wins everyone's hearts. However, Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience, after a person, who is revealed to be Munna's psychiatrist, asks him five questions about Gandhi, only two of which Munna is able to answer, with Gandhi's help, but as Gandhi does not reply to the other three, Munna cannot either. Munna finds that only after he has learned something about the real Gandhi's life can the Gandhi image talk about it, which serves as proof for his psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is hallucinating. Later, Munna decides to host Janhavi's radio show one last time, and he along with Circuit go there. Meanwhile, during Sunny and Simran's wedding, it is revealed to Simran by Lucky's wife that she is a manglik and she goes to the railway station adorned in her wedding dress to commit suicide as she does not want to start a relationship based on a lie, and is devastated to learn about her father's wrongdoings, because she always loved her father. But the taxi driver is Victor D'Souza, a man whose problem was solved on Munna's radio show. He explains to her that suicide is not the right choice and contacts Munna for advice. Munna and Circuit come directly to the wedding and cleverly question the astrological Maharaj, saying that if Maharaj can predict others' futures, then why can he not predict his own future, and attempts to persuade Kkhurana to allow the marriage to happen. However, Kkhurana is not convinced and tells Sunny to leave with him in the car. Sunny objects and Simran and Sunny exchange garlands. Gandhi's monologue at the end of the film, however, questions this conclusion. Munna, despite these defeats, continues to use Gandhigiri, a decision that transforms Lucky, and revives Janhavi's affection when she reconciles with Munna in jail. Lucky, happy that Sunny and Simran are married, gives up the Second Innings house. A Second Innings couple adopt Circuit as their son and Sunny and Simran had a happy life. Lucky then begins studying Gandhism, Gandhi and Gandhigiri, resulting in him too hallucinating Gandhi. Kkhurana has also removed the extra K in his name to become Khurana only, denying Maharaj's false prediction.

They also collaborated on the script. Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. was a runaway success that prompted the duo to contemplate a sequel. The sequel was initially known as Munna Bhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi and was later titled Munna Bhai 2nd Innings before the title Lage Raho Munna Bhai was finalized. In an interview, Hirani admitted that he felt the burden of expectation while writing the screenplay for Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as he had to create \\"something to match\\" the first film. Initially, there was some effort to incorporate scenes or characteristics of the first film into the sequel (such as the idiosyncratic laugh of Asthana, portrayed by Boman Irani in the first installment), but the risks of repetition were consciously averted. One of Hirani's goals in making the film was to revive an interest in Mahatma Gandhi, a figure whom he felt had been forgotten in contemporary India. To highlight this fact, Hirani recounted (during an interview) an incident with a chaiwala boy (who brings tea to the crew) during production: :The boy was curious, he was a big Munna Bhai fan and kept asking the name of the film. The first working title was Munna Bhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munna Bhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munna Bhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of politicians were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How can you not know his name? The other screenwriter, Abhijat Joshi (who teaches in the department of English at Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio), stated that he had been conducting extensive research on Gandhi, which inspired producer Chopra to involve Joshi in the creation of the second Munna Bhai screenplay. While writing the screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed together for more than 4 months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the \\"Aane Charaane\\" song. Only 2 characters‚Äîthose of Munna Bhai (portrayed by Sanjay Dutt) and Circuit (portrayed by Arshad Warsi)‚Äîwere retained from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. Several actors from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., appeared in Lage Raho Munna Bhai as different characters. Vidya Balan was chosen to play the leading lady Jahnavi as her voice was thought to be appropriate for that of a radio jockey. The actors used several techniques to develop their characters. Warsi encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film. Hirani recalled that on the first day of the shoot when Warsi said his first line, \\"he didn't sound like Circuit at all. He sounded like Arshad Warsi speaking with an accent.\\" Warsi admitted that he had \\"forgotten\\" the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. 3 times before being able to film the scene correctly. Dutt also confessed that he had to watch the first film 8 to 9 times to recapture the \\"persona\\" of Munna Bhai. In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Rather, he comments, his father, Sunil Dutt (who portrayed Munna Bhai's father in Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and his mother (the late actress Nargis) were his role models as they \\"were basically Gandhians. We were brought up with those values.\\" Dilip Prabhavalkar, who portrays Gandhi, read Gandhi's works \\"once again\\" to prepare for his role. Boman Irani prepared for the role of Lucky Singh by spending time with Sardarjis (male Sikhs) in auto spare parts shops to research his role. Vidya Balan met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work.  Themes & Impact  = Influences & Allusions = Each film in the Munna Bhai series features Munna and Circuit in a story that is comprehensive unto itself and is not continued or referred to in another in the series. Director Hirani has compared this format to the films of Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, as well as to the James Bond series. Others have also likened the series to the work of Laurel and Hardy. Some, however, have negated this comparison, stating that the series is more akin to the Road to... \\"buddy films\\" of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Hirani stated that his work was deeply inspired by the films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. = Social Influence = The interaction between the central characters of Mahatma Gandhi and Munna Bhai highlights concepts and ideas that draw upon the period of Colonial India and the Indian independence movement. Gandhi was a leader in this movement, challenging the British Empire's presence in India through the use of Satyagraha (non-violence). In the film, Jahnavi and Munna Bhai's non-violent protest against Lucky Singh serves as a metaphor for the Indian independence movement and the battle against the British Raj. The thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in Gandhism in India under the new term Gandhigiri and \\"made Gandhi suddenly hip\\" with Indians \\"staging non-violent protests, starting websites, handing out roses to enemies and putting on peaked white caps from the Gandhi era.\\" Arunabha Ghosh, in December 2006, noted in The Economic and Political Weekly that, \\"Gandhi, the man, was once the message. In the India of the post- liberalization brand, Gandhigiri is the message.\\" Amelia Gentleman of The International Herald Tribune/New York Times stated in September 2006 that: :\\"The real excitement was a Bollywood film [...] which [became] the unexpected box-office hit of the year [...] With its big Bollywood soundtrack and dance routines, the movie brings Gandhi firmly into the mainstream and theatres have been packed for the past 3 weeks. The Congress Party recommended that all party members see the film. The Delhi authorities declared that tickets to the film would be sold tax free because of its assiduous promotion of Gandhian values.\\" Mark Sappenfield of The Christian Science Monitor argued in 2006 that the film was appealing because, \\"Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems.\\" Swati Gauri Sharma suggested in The Boston Globe that what the United States \\"needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, Kinggiri, or Kennedygiri. If it worked for Bollywood, it could work for Hollywood.\\" = Gandhigiri-style Protests = Gandhi leading Salt Satyagraha, a notable example of satyagraha After the release of the film, Gandhigiri-style protests began to take place in India. In 2006, farmers staged a protest with flowers in the Vidarbha region, and people who organised a protest in Lucknow claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to use roses to convey their message. In Lucknow, students claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to do volunteer work, planting trees \\"to conserve nature which is bound to benefit public health.\\" Mafia don Babloo Srivastava claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to distribute roses as a \\"message of love and peace\\". In 2008, Indian Greenpeace activists delivered thousands of roses to Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors, to reconsider his plans of building a port at the nesting grounds of olive ridley sea turtles. The \\"Send Pramod Muthalik a Valentine's Day card\\" campaign in 2009 was inspired by the film. In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, founder of the Immigration Voice forum, initiated a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Over a three- day period, hundreds of flower bouquets were sent to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office by Indians who were legally in the US but caught in a green card backlog. On 17 July, the USCIS reversed the decision that led to the protest. = Impact = Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in books about Gandhi. In particular, demand for Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth increased after the film debuted, including requests from prison inmates. In addition, due to its influence, the film was made tax-free in Mumbai.  Release  = Screenings = Screened on 10 November 2006 in the United Nations auditorium, Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the first Hindi film to be shown at the UN. The film was introduced by Shashi Tharoor, UN Under-Secretary General for Communications and Public Information. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama observed that, \\"there was a thunderous applause at the high points of the film, like the pensioner shedding his clothes. The applause at the end of the screening was unending. A vibrant Q&A; session followed with director Rajkumar Hirani, writer Abhijat Joshi and actor Boman Irani, who flew to the U.S. for the screening.\\" The Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) noted that, \\"an evening that had started with massive security arrangements in the sombre UN setting, concluded in a festive atmosphere in the lounge of the UN with diplomats from other tables joining in raising a toast for the film.\\" The United Nations General Assembly announced on 15 June 2007 that 2 October, the day of Gandhi's birth (Gandhi Jayanti), was to be \\"the International Day of Non-Violence.\\" The Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, was given a private screening of Lage Raho Munna Bhai. After viewing the film, he stated that it \\"captures Bapu's message about the power of truth and humanism.\\" In a speech during his visit to South Africa, Singh said, \\"I was heartened to see recently that back home in India the most popular movie this festival season is a film about a young man's discovery of the universal and timeless relevance of the Mahatma's message.\\" Singh announced the creation of a new Public Services Bill to combat corruption in a press release dated 17 November 2006, and cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as one of its influences. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was further screened at a global judiciary summit in Lucknow in December 2006. After viewing the film, Justice Kenneth Mithyane from South Africa commented, \\"The movie has re- enlivened the non-violence philosophy practiced by Mahatma Gandhi who continues to remain close to the hearts of the South Africans.\\" Fatima Chouhan, a young member of the South African parliament, noted that, \\"'Munna Bhai' will be widely appreciated in South Africa. I'm carrying a couple of video discs for my family and friends.\\" It was part of the Tous Les Cinema du Monde section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was well received as the audience had lined \\"up in long queues to catch the film that had been strongly recommended in festival reviews [...] not one person who entered the screening left before the end of the 2-hours-30-minutes film.\\" In addition, \\"the screening of the movie at the festival saw people sitting on the aisles as the theatre was completely packed [...] there was also a big group of French students that clapped till the credits were finished.\\" Several universities held screenings. It was shown on 27 October 2006 at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. The screening was followed by a question and answer session with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani, and Abhijat Joshi. Filmmaker Gurinder Chadha attended and spoke at the conclusion of the question-and-answer session. The film was screened at Old Dominion University on 20 March 2007 (as a part of Old Dominion University and City of Norfolk OnFilm Festival), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lecture Series Committee on 23 & 24 March 2007, and Harvard Law School on 3 April 2007 (as part of a series on nonviolence). = Home Media & Screenplay = The British DVD of Lage Raho Munna Bhai contains a bonus DVD which has a 98-minute 5-part documentary on the making of the film, interviews with members of the cast and crew, and information on the creation of the song and dance numbers. It also has a special feature called \\"Munna meets Bapu.\\" Lage Raho Munna Bhai ‚Äì The Original Screenplay was released in December 2009. Published by Om Books International in association with Vinod Chopra Films, it was launched at an event with the original cast and crew. The text includes an introductory note by Abhijat Joshi which details the drafting of the screenplay. It also includes a number of stills from the film as well as character profiles. The film is available on Netflix.  Reception  = Critical Response = Lage Raho Munna Bhai received critical acclaim upon release. Subhash K. Jha said that \\"Munna and Circuit, arguably cinema's most adorable and roguish reformists since Laurel and Hardy go about the business of generating humour out of the pathos of the human condition. The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the lovelorn Munna Bhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out 5 stars, calling it \\"a sparkling example of qualitative cinema\\" arguing that it \\"not only entertains, it also enlightens.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that \\"Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel...\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 4 out of 5 stars and states: \\"Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munna Bhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride.\\" Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave 4 out of 5 stars stating that, \\"everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both to the quality of the writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own.\\" Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave 4 out of 5 stars stating that it \\"cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the d√©j√†-vu downer. And that precisely ranks Lage Raho Munna Bhai as one of the best entertainers this year.\\" He commended the it for showing \\"the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage raho, guys!\\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian gave the film 4 out of 5 stars noting that, \\"as western romantic comedies become more vapid and even stalkerish, this delivers a credible message of peace, while never forgetting to be magnificent entertainment.\\" Shastri Ramachandaran of The Tribune wrote, \\"True, there have been memorable films on Mahatma Gandhi by distinguished directors, namely Richard Attenborough and Shyam Benegal;one offering a respectful cinematic acquaintance and the other being didactic but inspiring. For all their earnestness, neither film stirred the popular imagination like LRM has done now.\\" Vaidyanathan from BBC declared that, \\"Lage Raho is not only as good as MBBS, but much better\\" calling it \\"a brilliant emotional roller coaster ride.\\" Jeremy Page of The Times discussed its enormous popularity upon release and noted the \\"serious point [the film made] about the need for tolerance, restraint and self-sacrifice.\\" Other critics offered more negative reviews. Ajit Duara argues in The Hindu that \\"the accomplished cultural sophistication and political genius of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has to be dumbed down to the astoundingly moronic levels of Lage Raho Munna Bhai.\\" Filmmaker Jahnu Barua was also critical, stating that \\"Gandhian philosophy is serious business and Lage Raho Munna Bhai is not the right way to show it.\\" Jug Suraiya of The Times of India wrote that \\"thanks to Munna Bhai, at best what exists of Gandhism is Gandhigiri, a watered-down, Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People version of the original.\\" = Other Response = Filmmaker Kabir Khan cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as a model film for him as it \\"had an issue, but it was never once in your face. Rajkumar Hirani kept it all so subtle and yet conveyed the message so well. It was as commercial as it gets and audiences too were thoroughly entertained. That's the way to make movies because it not just made all parties happy but also had a satisfied director at the end of it all.\\" According to Tushar Gandhi, Gandhi's great- grandson, it introduced the philosophies of Gandhi to a new generation, adding that \\"Bapu would've spoken the language of Gandhigiri if he were alive today. I really feel this film says something that needs to be told.\\" = Box office = Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006, earning gross in India alone and was rated a \\"blockbuster\\". The film collected a further during 2007 as the film enjoyed a tremendous golden jubilee run playing at a selected 210 cinemas until October of that year, being the only film to achieve this feat since Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995). It was also financially successful overseas, earning gross in the United Kingdom, gross in North America, and gross for the rest of the overseas proceeds, for a total of . Its total worldwide lifetime gross is , the equivalent to just over US$40 million when adjusted for inflation 2016. = Accolades = Lage Raho Munna Bhai is the recipient of 4 National Film Awards in addition to other awards. Some speculated that it would represent India as an entry for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Although ultimately losing to Rang De Basanti as India's official submission, the producers submitted it as an independent entry. However, neither film received an Oscar nomination.  Soundtrack  The music of Lage Raho Munna Bhai was composed by Shantanu Moitra and the lyrics were written by Swanand Kirkire. Swanand Kirkire won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics in 2007 for the song \\"Bande Mein Tha Dum.\\" According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fourteenth highest-selling.  Sequel  On 25 February 2016, Sanjay Dutt was released from Yerawada Central Jail after completing his sentence (2013‚Äì2016) for illegal possession of firearms in 1993. Vidhu Vinod Chopra announced on 29 September 2016 that production on the third Munna Bhai film starring Dutt in the title role would begin in 2017.

Though Million Yen Studio has since moved to a larger, more studio-like location, We Can Replace You was tracked and mixed in Andy Gerber's apartment in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood, with his upstairs neighbor's kitchen serving as the isolation room for the drums and bass. Founding bassist Brede Hovland laid down his final bass and vocal tracks just a day before leaving the band and Chicago to pursue a film production career in Los Angeles. After the album's completion, the band shipped it to independent labels and found a match with Orange Recordings, who released it in 2002. The disc garnered respectable airplay, gaining the #2 slot on the summer 2002 CMJ music listings behind Sonic Youth, and favorable press. The song \\"Silver Cloud\\" gained the band wider recognition from mainstream listeners as a free music sample on Dell computers. After touring behind We Can Replace You as a 3-piece, Hance, McIntyre and Payne parted ways.

Inspired by Tina Turner's song, the dance emerged as \\"The Nutbush\\" in the 1970s disco era. The Nutbush particularly took off in Australia during the 1980s, and is usually performed in schools, social gatherings and community events. The dance has gained such popularity in Australia that it has been implemented in some Australian states' curriculums. The dance is generally performed by a group of people of all genders and ages at a social function. Also, the dance is performed with the dancers roughly in a box configuration, like that of a chessboard. The steps are fairly simple, such that one who does not know them can generally pick them up by watching other dancers. A key in the song and dance being a popular combination is that the song has a moderately long introduction before the strong dance beat starts, which allows people who are sitting down to get up and to the dance floor and for all dancers to assemble themselves in a grid. For comparison, see the song \\"Do The Bus Stop\\". Implementation The steps to the dance are as follows: * hands are generally placed akimbo and feet shoulder-width apart in a neutral position. The following moves take place on the beat of the drum during the song. * the right foot is moved a step to the right, and then returned to the initial stance with a step. This is repeated, and then the same event takes place with the left foot, stepping left, and repeating. (eight beats) * the dancers then step back half a pace and return to the original stance twice on the right foot and twice with the left. (eight beats) * the right knee is brought across the body to approximately the height of the left hip twice, continuing with the left knee to right hip twice. (eight beats) * this is followed by a single kick of the right leg across the body and following with the left. (four beats) * and finally, the last four beats of the song are colloquially known as \\"turn-and-clap\\" whereupon the dancers turn counter- clockwise ¬º, pause, then clap. Variations of the final step are known to occur. For example, jumping both feet out (beat 1), jumping and crossing over your legs (beat 2), then uncrossing out to the side (beat 3), and finally \\"do the clap.\\" (beat 4) This variation is known as the criss-cross. World record attempts In 2015, dancers in the Victorian town of Horsham set the first Guinness World Record for the number of people doing the Nutbush, with 254 dancers. On 19 October 2017, students at Rivermount College in Yatala, Queensland doubled this record with 522 dancers. On 12 July 2018 the record was broken again at The Big Red Bash, a music festival situated beneath the Big Red Dune on the edge of the Simpson Desert in outback Queensland. Crowds lined up to take part, dancing along to \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" as 1,719 people took part in the challenge. On 16 July 2019, a new record of 2,330 people performed the Nutbush at the Big Red Bash, breaking the previous year's record.

This TCP option, along with several others, is defined in IETF RFC 1323 which deals with long fat networks (LFNs). TCP windows The throughput of a communication is limited by two windows: the congestion window and the receive window. The congestion window tries not to exceed the capacity of the network (congestion control); the receive window tries not to exceed the capacity of the receiver to process data (flow control). The receiver may be overwhelmed by data if for example it is very busy (such as a Web server). Each TCP segment contains the current value of the receive window. If, for example, a sender receives an ack which acknowledges byte 4000 and specifies a receive window of 10000 (bytes), the sender will not send packets after byte 14000, even if the congestion window allows it.  Theory  TCP window scale option is needed for efficient transfer of data when the bandwidth-delay product (BDP) is greater than 64K. For instance, if a T1 transmission line of 1.5 Mbit/second was used over a satellite link with a 513 millisecond round trip time (RTT), the bandwidth-delay product is \\\\scriptstyle 1,500,000 \\\\times 0.513 = 769,500 bits or about 96,187 bytes. Using a maximum buffer size of 64 KiB only allows the buffer to be filled to (65,535 / 96,187) = 68% of the theoretical maximum speed of 1.5 Mbits/second, or 1.02 Mbit/s. By using the window scale option, the receive window size may be increased up to a maximum value of 1,073,725,440\\\\ \\\\scriptstyle \\\\left(= (2^{16}-1)\\\\times(2^{14}) = 65,535 \\\\times 16,384)\\\\right) bytes. This is done by specifying a two byte shift count in the header options field. The true receive window size is left shifted by the value in shift count. A maximum value of 14 may be used for the shift count value. This would allow a single TCP connection to transfer data over the example satellite link at 1.5 Mbit/second utilizing all of the available bandwidth. Essentially, not more than one full transmission window can be transferred within one round-trip time period.

She was originally played by actress Jane Rose, and then from 1968 to 1978 by actress Joanna Roos, who was most identified in the role; and then until the show's end in 1980 by actress Valerie Cossart. Vanessa and Meg's saintly mother Sarah is the mother of Vanessa Dale and her sister, Meg. She was the epitome of the good mother. While her husband, Will Dale, was stern and strict, she was compassionate and loving. After Will died and her daughters moved away to New York City, she was lonely, but Van would often come back to the community of Barrowsville, where the Dale family had always lived, to keep her mother updated on what troubles Meg had gotten herself into. Several years later after Meg had moved to other parts, taking Sarah's grandson, Ben \\"Beanie\\" Harper, with her; Vanessa moved to Rosehill, New York, where she had married a man named Bruce Sterling. Some time later, Sarah moved to Rosehill herself, to be closer to Vanessa. She had also found new love years after the death of Will. She had met and married the Rosehill town pharmacist, Alex Caldwell, until his untimely death. Later on, she had been stricken with a brain abscess, and was almost near death herself. She wanted to see Meg one last time, since she had been gone for seventeen years. Van and her husband did some investigating and discovered that Van's sister had last been married to a man named Edouard Aleata. The couple sent a letter to Meg, but was intercepted by her daughter, Caroline Aleata. Like her half-brother, Ben, she too had been ignored by Meg and needed love desperately. Van took compassion on Cal and welcomed her into the family with open arms, as did the loving Sarah. When Meg appeared, Sarah recovered. Although she was pleased to see Meg, her happiness was tempered by the fact that Meg hadn't changed one bit. She was still amoral and devious, and was still attracted to wealthy and evil men. Sarah ran a gardening shop called \\"The Potting Shed\\" in Rosehill, and some years after her second husband's death, she met a professor at Rosehill University named Timothy McCauley. Sarah had met him when Vanessa and Bruce moved into a house that he owned. They were enchanted by one another and they married and spent their twilight years together. Trivia Joanna Roos had begun her career with the series in 1955 playing another character's mother. She played the compassionate Althea Raven, the mother of Vanessa's first husband, Paul Raven (Richard Coogan). She took care of Paul's daughter, Carol, after the murder of her insane former daughter in-law, Judith Lodge Raven (Virginia Robinson). Fourteen years after she first appeared as Althea, Ms. Roos returned to Love of Life and became the second (and best known) Sarah Dale, the mother of Vanessa. She played the role from 1968-1978, when she retired and the role was recast with Valerie Cossart, who played her through the series end in 1980. Seven years after Love of Life ended, actress Audrey Peters, who played the third and final Vanessa Dale, joined the cast of Guiding Light playing the mother of breakout character Reva Shayne, who was aptly named, Sarah Shayne.

He promoted the value of classical Greek learning and was one of the first to print a text based on Ptolemy's Geographica. Berlinghieri studied poetry under the tutelage of Cristoforo Landino. Career Berlinghieri was born in Florence into a family with over 200 years of involvement in Florentine politics. He served in a variety of governmental offices including as Prior of the Signoria and Conservator of Laws. In 1479 he was appointed Florentine ambassador at the Gonzaga court in Mantua¬π. He later found employment in Florence in the court of Lorenzo de' Medici and took part in the Platonic Academy, founded by Marsilio Ficino. Berlinghieri provided financial support to Ficino during the latter's translation of Plato's works into Latin. In 1464 Berlinghieri started to work on a treatise based upon Ptolemy's Geographica. He updated its maps and included a commentary in verse form. It was printed in 1482 with copper engraved maps by the German printer Nicolaus Laurentii, also known as Niccol√≤ Tedesco, under the title Septe Giornate della Geographia di Francesco Berlinghieri meaning \\"The Seven Days of Geography\\". It was one of the first printed works based on Ptolemy and also the first to be printed in vernacular Italian. Berlinghieri was also among the first to supplement the traditional maps contained in the Geographia with updated maps of France, Italy, Spain and the Holy Land.¬≤ Berlinghieri's work was originally to be dedicated to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. When the sultan died in 1481, Berlinghieri dedicated it to Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino. Unfortunately, the duke died before the final edition was printed. Additionally, manuscript copies of the book were dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici and Federigo da Montefeltro and individual copies of the printed edition were dedicated to the Ottoman Sultan, at that time Bayezid II and his half-brother Cem Sultan.¬≥ References ¬π Assunto Mori, ‚ÄúUn geografo del Rinascimento (Francesco di Niccol√≤ Berlinghieri),‚Äù Archivio storico italiano, vol. 13, 1894, pp. 341‚Äì348 and Angela Codazzi, ‚ÄúFrancesco Berlinghieri,‚Äù entry in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 9 (Rome, Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1967), pp. 121‚Äì124. ¬≤ R.A.

He was Director of Environment at OECD in Paris (1978‚Äì1984), Secretary General of the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission) and lead author of its landmark report Our Common Future (1984‚Äì1987), and member and Chairman of the World Bank's Inspection Panel (1997‚Äì2002). He was a member of the Caspian Development Advisory Panel, the jury of the Volvo Foundation‚Äôs Environment Prize, and a member of several boards including the Woods Hole Research Center, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Background MacNeill was born in Saskatchewan and received Bachelor of Science degrees for both physics and mathematics in 1949 and a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in 1958 from the University of Saskatchewan and a Graduate Diploma in Economics and Political Science in 1951 from the University of Stockholm, Sweden. Career On his return from graduate studies in Sweden, MacNeill began his public service career in Saskatchewan in 1952 as a research economist in T. C. Douglas' cabinet's Economic Advisory and Planning Board. In 1959, he became Executive Director of the South Saskatchewan River Development Commission with responsibility for coordinating the power, irrigation, and other aspects of that project. In 1964, as Vice Chairman and Executive Director of the Saskatchewan Water Resources Commission, his responsibilities were broadened to include management of all of the Province's water resources. Between 1965 and 1976, he held various senior positions with the Government of Canada. He was Director of Policy and Planning in the then new Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (1965‚Äì1968), moving on to Acting Assistant Deputy Minister, Water and Renewable Resources in 1968. He was appointed Special Advisor on the Constitution and Environment in the Privy Council Office in 1969. Over the next two years, he developed the Government's basic position on the environment and the constitution and wrote his first book, Environmental Management. In 1971, he joined Canada's then new Department of Environment as Director General of Intergovernmental Affairs where he led much of Canada's substantive preparations for the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. In 1972, he became Assistant Secretary and, in 1974, Secretary (or Deputy Minister) of the new Ministry of State for Urban Affairs, Canada's first attempt to intervene nationally in the process of urban growth and development. In 1975, he was additionally appointed Canadian Commissioner General and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary with responsibility for Canada's national and international preparations for the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements held in Vancouver in May, 1976. Moving to the international arena in 1977, Jim MacNeill served for seven years in Paris as Director of Environment for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). While at OECD, he oversaw a program of empirical research on the relationships between the environment and the economy. In 1984, this work resulted in OECD finding that \\"the environment and the economy could be made mutually reinforcing,\\" a concept that has since moved into the mainstream. In 1984, he became a member and Secretary General of the World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission). He was the chief architect and principal author of the Commission's world-acclaimed report Our Common Future, which was presented to the UN General Assembly in 1987. Setting out a new global agenda for sustainable development, the report recommended what became the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio (the Earth Summit). From 1989 to 1992, he acted as a Special Advisor to the Secretary General of the Conference, Maurice Strong. He also established and chaired the EcoFund, which raised special funding for preparations of the Conference. Between 1988 and 2006, MacNeill served in a number of Canadian and international positions: Senior Fellow, Institute for Research on Public Policy (1988‚Äì1993); Senior Advisor to the President of the International Development Research Center (IDRC) (1992‚Äì1997); and Senior Advisor to the Administrator, United Nations Development Programme (1994‚Äì1999) where he carried through a fundamental reorganization of UNDP's work on environment and sustainable development. From 1994-1997, he served as a member on the Board of Directors of Ontario Hydro, then the largest electrical power utility in North America. In 1990, he was asked by Per Gyllenhammar, Chief Executive of Volvo, to assist him in designing the Volvo Foundation‚Äôs Environment Prize and has served as a member (and now Chairman) of the Prize Jury ever since. In 1994, as an advisor to Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, he negotiated an agreement between Mikhail Gorbachev as the Chairman of Green Cross International and Maurice Strong as the Chairman of the Earth Council to undertake the development of an Earth Charter, a code of ethical principles which has now been endorsed by over 8,000 organizations representing more than 100 million people worldwide. In 1990, he was one of three founding members of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, an initiative of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and Premier Gary Filmon of Manitoba, and served as Chairman between 1994 and 1999. In 1997, MacNeill became a member and in 1999 full-time Chairman of the World Banks Independent Inspection Panel to which people affected by a Bank-financed project can appeal for an investigation of their complaints over the heads of their government and of Bank Management. Since 2003, he has been a member of the Caspian Development Advisory Panel, an independent body commissioned by Lord John Browne, Group Chief Executive Officer of BP, to advise him on the economic, environmental and social impacts of the Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline and other related BP activities in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Relationship to Maurice Strong In 2005 the New York Sun ran a front page special edition in which it reported that Jim MacNeill was a close associate of fellow Canadian Maurice Strong, and that MacNeill's career in the United Nations benefited from that relationship. Maurice Strong was a close adviser to former UN Secretary General Koffi Annan and became embroiled in what is now known as the Oil for Food Program Scandal and reportedly received millions of dollars from North Korean and Iraqi lobbyists. Since Strong left the UN in 2005 following the scandal, there appears to be little linking the two men. However Jim MacNeill's relationship with Maurice Strong is well-documented before then - their shared background includes activities ranging from sharing high-profile awards, to sitting on the Board of Directors of the same non- profit corporation to transferring million of dollars of charity money raised by MacNeill in the US to an organization created by Strong in Canada. Strong is credited in assisting with the creation and submission of the 1987 Brundtland Report (called \\"Our Common Future\\") that would be presented to the UN General Assembly and become the basis for the 1992 Earth Summit. In 1992 when Maurice Strong launched the Earth Council Foundation (now the Earth Council Alliance) from his position as Secretary General of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, Jim MacNeill had a seat on the first Board of Directors. An independent auditor's report for the Earth Council Foundation's operations ending in October 31, 1993 revealed that a charity based in the United States and run by MacNeill called EcoFund '92 (now called Earth Council Foundation U.S.) had sent $1.3 million of its own funds to Maurice Strong's Earth Council Foundation in Canada, which is not a charity but a non-profit corporation. In 2002, the two were the sole recipients of the United Nations Candlelight Award, which was presented to them personally by Kofi Annan.

In most legal systems, some creditors are given priority over ordinary creditors, either for the whole amount of their claims or up to a certain value. In some legal systems, preferential creditors take priority over all other creditors, including creditors holding security, but more commonly, the preferential creditors are only given priority over unsecured creditors. Some legal systems operate a hybrid approach; in the United Kingdom preferential creditors have priority over secured creditors whose security is in the nature of a floating charge, but creditors with fixed security take ahead of the preferential creditors generally. In English law the concept was first introduced for personal bankruptcy in 1825 pursuant to the Bankrupts (England) Act 1825, and for companies in 1888 pursuant to the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act 1888. Prior to that, all unsecured creditors ranked equally and without preference (\\"pari passu\\") in a series of statutes stretching back to the Statute of Bankrupts 1542. Classes of preferred creditors Creditors who are characteristically preferred creditors are: * employees:( If a company goes bankrupt, the employees of that company will be first in line to be paid. If the company owes wages, this is considered to be the top priority when it comes to dissolving the company.) * revenue authorities: When a government is owed taxes, they are on the top of the list to get paid. * in some countries, tort victims: The rationale for tort victims is that they are perceived to be \\"involuntary\\" creditors of the bankrupt and thus should not be penalised by an insolvency in the same manner as parties who voluntarily became creditors of the bankrupt. * in some countries, environmental clean-up costs: If a business files for bankruptcy and it is determined that they need to clean up the environment as a result of their business actions, the environmental clean up will get preferential treatment. The courts will allocate a designated amount of money to pay for the cleanup efforts. In the United Kingdom, employees‚Äô holiday pay/wages are classed as preferential ‚Äì if they are paid via redundancy payments fund then the Department of Employment becomes a secured creditor. If there is a shortfall, in those cases where someone earns in excess of the government limit, then they can claim preferentially too. The right of the Crown as a preferential creditor was removed by the Enterprise Act 2002 but reintroduced with effect from 1 December 2020 by the Finance Act 2020. Creditors, and sometimes individual assets, are also placed in classes by specific laws for specific events, such as a deposit insurance scheme triggered by a bank failure. For example, Switzerland's deposit protection has Class I (first-class), Class II (second-class) and Class III (third-class) unsecured creditors.Einlagensicherung.

History The first such trust set up was for the benefit of a rabbi, resulting in the name Rabbi Trust. Revenue Procedure 92-64 further clarified the acceptable rules for Rabbi trusts along with a model trust document and the required features to avoid constructive receipt of income to the employee. Applications An example of a Rabbi trust applying where an employee receives compensation the taxation of which is deferrable is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. A Rabbi trust may be applicable when one business purchases another business but wants to set aside part of the purchase price and defer payment as well as taxability to the payee upon the satisfaction of conditions to which both parties agree. =Non-qualified deferred compensation plans= A non-qualified deferred compensation plan is one under which current income of an employee is deferred and therefore not taxable to the employee. An employer sets aside assets in a separate trust for the employee in the future. Ordinarily, this would cause current inclusion into gross income even though the employer has yet to reduce the money to income because of the economic benefit theory doctrine. Funds deposited in such a plan permitted by a private letter ruling would not result in income, according to Section 83(a) of the Code, if the assets of the trust were available to the employer's general creditors. This is because until the employee is vested, that employee is under a substantial risk of forfeiture and under Section 83(a) and accompanying regulations 1.83-1 and as such is not subject to current inclusion into that employee's gross income. All non- qualified deferred-compensation plans must involve substantial risk of forfeiture or other methods of avoiding constructive receipt, such as conditioning payment upon performance of future conditions or service. The unique feature of the Rabbi Trust is that the money placed into the trust is protected from changes of heart of the employer. Once placed in the trust, the money cannot be revoked by decisions made by the employer. As long as the employer's financial position is sound, the money in a Rabbi Trust is considered to be relatively safe. However, if an employer files for bankruptcy protection, the money may be subject to the claims made by that employer's general unsecured creditors. =Acquisition of a business= When one business purchases another business, the purchasing business may want to set aside part of the purchase price and defer its payment to the payee upon the satisfaction of conditions to which both parties agree. A Rabbi trust may be used in this situation to defer the taxability to the payee of the deferred payments of the purchase price. For the Rabbi trust to be successfully applied, there must be a real risk of forfeiture upon the failure by the payee to fulfill the agreed upon conditions. If the condition is impossible to fail, then constructive receipt may overcome the successful application of the Rabbi trust.

History In 1806 the Prince of Wales (later George IV) gave Royal Assent for the theatre to be built and it opened on 27 June 1807, with a performance of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The theatre struggled until it was purchased in 1854 by actor Henry John Nye Chart, who engaged theatre architect Charles J. Phipps to begin a programme of expansion and redevelopment. The theatre improved its reputation and finances, becoming a respected venue. When Henry John Nye Chart died in 1876 his wife, Ellen Elizabeth Nye Chart, took over and continued the success as one of the first female theatre managers. There is a statue to honour her in the Royal Circle bar. The venue used to have a \\"gulp bar\\", a backstage bar where actors could get a drink, even mid-performance. In 1920 the financial buoyancy of the Theatre enabled the directors to buy adjacent properties and make substantial improvements to the building. In 1923 the Theatre purchased the Colonnade Hotel, now the Colonnade bar and in 1927 the last major structural enlargement was made to the auditorium.http://www.nlcaonline.org.uk/page_id__37.aspx In the mid and later 20th Century the Royal's stature and national reputation continued to grow. Ibsen, Rattigan, Coward and Orton plays opened as a try out date before a London West End run.

A trencher is a piece of construction equipment used to dig trenches, especially for laying pipes or electrical cables, for installing drainage, or in preparation for trench warfare. Trenchers may range in size from walk-behind models, to attachments for a skid loader or tractor, to very heavy tracked heavy equipment. Types Trenchers come in different sizes and may use different digging implements, depending on the required width and depth of the trench and the hardness of the surface to be cut. =Wheel trencher= Caterpillar A rockwheel A wheel trencher or rockwheel is composed of a toothed metal wheel. It is cheaper to operate and maintain than chain-type trenchers. It can work in hard or soft soils, either homogeneous (compact rocks, silts, sands) or heterogeneous (split or broken rock, alluvia, moraines). This is particularly true because a cutting wheel works by clearing the soil as a bucket-wheel does, rather than like a rasp (chain trencher). Consequently, it will be less sensitive to the presence of blocks in the soil. They are also used to cut pavement for road maintenance and to gain access to utilities under roads. Due to its design the wheel may reach variable cutting depths with the same tool, and can keep a constant soil working angle with a relatively small wheel diameter (which reduces the weight and therefore the pressure to the ground, and the height of the unit for transport). The cutting elements (6 to 8 depending on the diameter) are placed around the wheel, and bear the teeth which are more or less dense depending on the ground they will encounter. These tools can be easily changed manually, and adjusted to allow different cutting widths on the same wheel. The teeth are placed in a semi- spherical configuration to increase the removal of the materials from the trench. The teeth are made of high strength steel (HSLA steel, tool steel or high speed steel) or cemented carbide. When the machine is under heavy use, the teeth may need to be replaced frequently, even daily. A system of spacers and ejectors allows the excavated materials to be moved away from the edges of the trench to avoid possible ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù. Wheel trenchers may be mounted on tracks or rubber tires. =Chain trencher= A track trencher with a digging chain Tesmec M5 Mechanical Trencher in Seymour, WI A chain trencher cuts with a digging chain or belt that is driven around a rounded metal frame, or boom. It resembles a giant chainsaw. This type of trencher can cut ground that is too hard to cut with a bucket-type excavator, and can also cut narrow and deep trenches. The angle of the boom can be adjusted to control the depth of the cut. To cut a trench, the boom is held at a fixed angle while the machine creeps slowly. The chain trencher is used for digging wider trenches (telecommunication, electricity, drainage, water, gas, sanitation, etc.) especially in rural areas. The excavated materials can be removed by conveyor belt reversible either on the right or on the left side. There are various methods for excavating trenches in rock ‚Äì principally drill and blast, hydraulic breakers and chain trenchers. Selection of a trench excavation method must take into account a range of rock and machine properties. It is suggested that the advantages of using chain trenchers in suitable rock outweigh the limitations and may have cost benefits and fewer adverse environmental effects compared with alternative methods., Advantages and limitations of using chain trenchers in rock, Pipelines International September 2009 =Micro trencher= A micro trencher is a \\"small rockwheel\\" specially designed for work in urban area. It is fitted with a cutting wheel that cuts a microtrench with smaller dimensions than can be achieved with conventional trench digging equipment. A Marais micro trencher machine Microtrench widths range from about with a depth of or less. These machines are sometimes radio-controlled. With a micro trencher, the structure of the road is maintained and there is no associated damage to the road. Owing to the reduced trench size, the volume of waste material excavated is also reduced. Micro trenchers are used to minimize traffic or pedestrian disturbance during network laying. They may also be used to install FTTx connections. A micro trencher can work on sidewalks or in narrow streets of cities, and can cut harder ground than a chain trencher, including cutting through solid stone. They are also used to cut pavement for road maintenance and to gain access to utilities under roads. =Portable trencher= A portable assault trencher machine in operation Landscapers and lawn care specialist may use a portable trencher to install landscape edging and irrigation lines. These machines are lightweight (around 200 pounds) and are easily maneuverable compared to other types of trenchers. The cutting implement may be a chain or a blade similar to a rotary lawn mower blade oriented so that it rotates in a vertical plane. =Tractor-mount trencher= Tractor mount trencher while going to construction area to dig trenches for fiber optic cable mounting process. A tractor-mount trencher is a trenching device which needs a creeping gear tractor to operate. This type of trenchers is another type of chain trencher. The tractor should be able to go as slowly as the trencher's trenching speed. Applications A trencher may be combined with a drainage pipe or geotextile feeder unit and backfiller, so drain or textile may be placed and the trench filled in one pass.

The large size, fine colour and unusual form of the hawksbill's scutes make it especially suitable. The distinctive patterning is referred to in names such as the tortoiseshell cat, several breeds of guinea pig, and the common names of several species of the butterfly genera Nymphalis and Aglais, and some other uses. Uses Tortoiseshell was widely used from ancient times in the North and in Asia, until the trade was banned in 2014. It was used, normally in thin slices or pieces, in the manufacture of a wide variety of items such as combs, small boxes and frames and inlays in furniture (known as Boulle Work carried out by Andr√©-Charles Boulle) and other items, frames for spectacles, guitar picks and knitting needles. Despite being expensive, tortoiseshell was attractive to manufacturers and consumers because of its beautiful mottled appearance, its durability, and its organic warmth against the skin.Tortoiseshell ban threatens Japanese tradition, CNN website The initial processing involved separating the layers of the scutes from the animal's carapace by heating, softening the plates by boiling them in salt water and flattening them under a press. Two pieces could be fused by use of a hot iron, but like the earlier stages, great care had to be taken not to lose the colour. Finishing and polishing was done by various techniques mainly in Europe or in the US.Transactions, 344-346 Craftsmen in various Asian countries have also perfected this art.

The synthetic Delrin has been used especially for guitar picks. Brands of synthetic substitutes for tortoiseshell include Tortoloid and Tor-tis. History Tortoiseshell has been used since ancient times, and the ancient Greek chelys or lyre often used a whole shell to form its body. Inlaid veneers of tortoiseshell were popular with wealthy ancient Romans for furniture, especially couches for dining, and for small items.Transactions, 344 The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, probably a work of the 1st century AD, distinguishes between shell from different species, with that regarded as the best probably the hawksbill.Casson, 205 Andr√© Charles Boulle (1642-1732), cabinetmaker to Louis XIV of France introduced or perfected marquetry combining thin inlays of tortoiseshell backed with metal, with woods and metal, a style still called after him.

It is commonly found in south Texas, Mexico, and Central America but mostly studied in Costa Rica. This butterfly prefers subtropical climates and areas in which there is a lot of moisture, such as near rivers. It spends much of its time in second-growth areas, meaning woodland areas that have regrown after harvest. Its larvae feed on plants in the family Acanthaceae, while adults primarily feed on flower nectar from Acanthus species. The species is diurnal, meaning that they are active in the daytime and inactive at night. These butterflies face interspecies competition for nectar with other butterflies and must also compete with hummingbirds, who will chase them away. Parental care in this species is non-existent. The eggs are laid in low-lying host plant leaves and flower bracts. Several hundred are laid by a single female within the span of a few days, with only a small percentage of the eggs surviving to adulthood. Eggs take five days to hatch and the larvae complete six instar phases before pupation. After pupation is complete, adults emerge and fly off within 1‚Äì2 hours. This butterfly has no protective coloration and is not toxic to predators. It is the victim of predation by many bird, lizard, frog, and arthropod species. However, this butterfly is so ubiquitous that losses from predation do not cause endangerment of the species.  Geographic range  Although Anartia fatima has been recorded once as far north as Kansas, its range generally begins in southern Texas and continues south through Mexico and all of Central America and Panama. It is quite ubiquitous throughout its range. After this point, A. fatima is no longer found and a closely related species, Anartia amathea, becomes prevalent.  Habitat  This butterfly prefers to spend its time in subtropical open areas and previously disturbed places, such as second-growth areas, from sea level to 1,500 meters. Its host plants of preference are herbaceous and are primarily restricted to the species in a single family, Acanthaceae. Some common examples of its host plants are Blechum, Justicia, Dicliptera, and Ruellia. The banded peacock exists in extensive tracts of forest in small populations along the banks of rivers. This suggests that individuals disperse across long distances.  Home range and territoriality  = Male defense of places likely to attract females = The banded peacock is a diurnal species, meaning that it is active during the day. From late morning until early afternoon, males perch on low vegetation and chase other male butterflies away from their territory. The males fly in a slow zig-zag pattern between 0.3 and 0.6 meters above ground in order to patrol the area around their territory and look for females. In this territory, the male will search for mates and receive most of his nutritional requirements from flowers.  Food resources  = Caterpillars =  Host plant preferences  In South Texas, there is a preference for Ruellia, but continuing southward any other Acanthaceae is sufficient. Larvae will feed on host plant vegetation. = Adults =  Adult diet  The adults feed on flower nectar from Acanthus and other flower nectars. Males arise earlier than the females to begin their search for food and to prepare in their search for female mates. Females do not venture out until there is more sunlight.  Pollination  In the process of feeding on the flower nectar from Acanthus and other plants, the butterflies would subsequently play a role in pollination of these plants by picking up and depositing pollen as they moved from flower to flower.  Parental care  = Oviposition = Single eggs are laid on leaf surfaces or between flower bracts on host plants, such as Blechum. Females have been observed to oviposit on the leaf surfaces of low-growing Hydrocotyle and Spermacoce assurgens growing near small patches of Blechum. Ovipositions lasted for 5‚Äì10 seconds each. Each time a female landed on a host plant, she would quickly oviposit and take off, and then subsequently land again on the next plant she encountered. Females have high fecundity and can lay several hundred eggs over the course of a few days.  Social behavior  = Adult sociality = Sets of adults seek shelter, feed, and mate within the same areas. However, no forms of social grouping are observed. These butterflies exhibit roosting behavior on the underside of leaves in late evening. This is done in an upside-down manner while closing their wings. It is thought that the purpose of this behavior is to remain hidden from predators.  Life cycle  = Eggs = The spherical eggs are approximately 1 mm in diameter. They rest for approximately 5 days before they hatch. = Larvae = The larvae go through 6 instar phases, each lasting different periods of time and causing different changes in physiology. The stages last approximately 3.25, 3.06, 2.81, 3.13, 3.31, and 6.88 days respectively. = Pupae = After these stages are complete, the larvae nearing pupation will wander for about one day and then prepare a silk pupation platform several centimeters above the ground on the bottom of a leaf or twig. The pupal period will last between 6 and 8 days, after which the organism has transitioned to the adult butterfly phase. = Adult = Adult butterflies will emerge in the morning and will be ready to fly within one to two hours. The adults tend to have dorsal colored wings that are dark brown with four or five red spots of varying sizes located on the basal portion of the hindwing. Polymorphism can be seen in the adults as one is white-banded and another is yellow-banded. Both of these morphs have a median band running across both the forewing and hindwing with seven small spots near the apex and post median area of the forewing.  Migration  Banded peacock butterflies have a relatively short lifespan and make flights north to South Texas at all times of the year. There are some years, however, when colonies do not make the journey north. In the coming of the dry season, this species was observed to exhibit a southeasterly migration along the Pacific coast from Guanacaste to Monteverde, Costa Rica.  Enemies  The banded peacock is often the subject of predation by birds, lizards, frogs, spiders and other insects. This butterfly is often found with bird and lizard beak marks, resulting from close calls with their predators.  Protective coloration and behavior  Within the family Lepidoptera, the banded peacock is one of the most palatable species to predators and is often used as a control food item in experiments studying warning coloration and mimicry. Although vertical stripes are usually a sign of chemically protected species, the banded peacock does not seem to gain any protection from its striped coloration.  Genetics of color patterns  This species has two polymorphic forms, one which is white-banded and another that is yellow-banded. Both of these morphs have a median band running across both the forewing and hindwing with seven small spots near the apex and post median area of the forewing. There is no distinction between males and females besides for the fact that the females tend to have more diffusely-edged pattern elements. The genetic basis of the polymorphism is still unknown; however, studies have shown a difference in mate selection in different seasons. In the dry season, it was shown that the white-banded females attracted both white and yellow males about twice as often as yellow-banded females attracted these males. In the wet season, mate selection returned to 1:1 proportions.  Mating  = Female/male interactions =  Courting  When a male in the course of his flight activity sees a female banded peacock butterfly, he immediately dives down to the other butterfly. If the female butterfly flies up, the male will chase after her for some distance. If the female does not fly up, the male will fly very close to the female and flutter his wings above her for about thirty seconds. This is known as the approach behavior of the male. If the female is a virgin, she will close her wings over her thorax and expose her abdomen in preparation for a lateral approach by the male. The male will then position his abdomen for copulation by curving it around his head and then walk up to the female in parallel orientation to initiate coupling.  Interspecific competition  The banded peacock is in direct competition for flower nectar with other butterfly species as well as with the hummingbird. The hummingbird is observed to be territorial over its foraging area and will chase away and pursue intruders, such as the banded peacock butterfly. As a result, the banded peacock butterfly is in direct competition with this species and it is a relationship in which the butterfly can only evade and cannot fight back to continue foraging in the area.  Conservation  This butterfly is quite ubiquitous in the regions in which in inhabits. It suffers little consequence from predation and human factors. Its migratory patterns are not threatened by any causes.

He joined the New Jersey station WJZ in 1921, not just as an announcer but also as a singer, often engaging in recitals with the station's staff pianist, Keith McLeod.New York Daily News, September 8, 1926 By 1927, WJZ had moved to Manhattan and had become the flagship station of the Blue Network of NBC's new national radio network. Cross' voice became familiar as he not only delivered announcements for the Blue Network but also hosted a number of popular programs. Cross was the announcer for the quiz program Information Please and the musical humor show The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street, among others. In the 1940s Cross hosted a Sunday morning show featuring child performers, called Coast To Coast on a Bus. =Metropolitan Opera broadcasts= From 1931 to 1975, Cross served as host for the weekly live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, the job for which he is most remembered. His distinctive voice conveyed the excitement of live performances \\"from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City\\" for generations of radio listeners. Initially, he broadcast from a seat in \\"Box 44\\" at the old Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 40th Street. In 1966, he introduced the radio audience to the Met's new home at Lincoln Center as he hosted a special broadcast of the opening night performance from a modern radio booth in the new house. For 43 seasons, he was the main (usually sole) commentator. In the 1930s, he shared some broadcasts with other commentators, such as Deems Taylor, John B. Kennedy and Marcia Davenport, and Robert Woldrop replaced him (for unknown reasons) for the April 3, 1937 broadcast of Das Rheingold and the May 15, 1937 broadcast of Mignon. He also missed two later broadcasts (Rigoletto ‚Äì February 10, 1973 and Norma ‚Äì February 17, 1973) due to the death of his wife. Cross never retired but died in New York from a heart attack during the Met season of 1974‚Äì75. His first Met broadcast was Hansel and Gretel on December 25, 1931 and his last was of Turandot on December 28, 1974, 43 years and 3 days later. He was succeeded by Peter Allen, who had been his standby announcer. A native New Yorker, Cross died in New York City where he had lived all his life. He is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. Books and recordings Cross edited several popular editions of opera synopses, published in conjunction with the Met broadcasts. One such book is entitled ‚ÄúMilton Cross‚Äô Complete Stories of the Great Operas,‚Äù originally published in 1949 and recounts 72 great operas. He also co-authored (with David Ewen) Milton Cross' Encyclopedia of the Great Composers and their Music ‚Äì a set of biographies of 78 composers, published in 1953 by Doubleday & Co. Cross was also featured as narrator on several records, including: * Peter and the Wolf, 4 78-rpm discs, c. 1950, Musicraft Records M 65 302‚Äì305Recordings by Milton Cross * Milton Cross Explains, 2 discs each, Ottenheimer Publishers/Cabot Records 1958Classical music on children's records ** The Instruments of the Orchestra CAB 4021 ** The Magic of Music CAB 4022 Popular culture Cross was parodied in Peter Schickele's album, P. D. Q. Bach: The Stoned Guest. Will Jordan played the role of \\"Milton Host\\", the host, who gave the commentary and told the listener what the synopsis of the act for the opera was. An earlier parody of Cross came in the character of \\"Doktor Quilton Foss\\" in G.I. Carmen, an all-soldier musical stage production of the U.S. Army. Billed as \\"the Boilesk Voishin\\" the show toured occupied Europe from June 9, 1945 through January 24, 1946. Again the host, \\"Foss\\" introduced the show and offered commentary throughout the evening's proceedings.

It was built for Howard & Wyndham Ltd under its chairman Baillie Michael Simons as a sister theatre of their Theatre Royal in the city and was designed by Frank Matcham, opening in 1904. The theatre is primarily a receiving house for touring musicals, dance, comedy and circus-type performances. The theatre also provides a prominent stage for local amateur productions. The King's Theatre also stages an annual pantomime, produced by First Family Entertainment The theatre is currently operated by the Ambassador Theatre Group, under a lease from Glasgow City Council who own the building.  Location  The theatre occupies the corner of Bath Street and Elmbank Street, in the Charing Cross area of the city. The longer Bath Street elevation houses both the main entrance, the scenery dock and stage door. The equally decorative but shorter Elmbank Street elevation has various fire exits and the entrance to the Gallery.  History  The King's Theatre was commissioned by the theatre company Howard & Wyndham at a cost of over ¬£50,000 and opened on 12 September 1904. In the 1930s like many city theatres, it had been policy to close during the summer while many city residents headed to the coast for their holidays, but this all changed in 1933 when the then managing director of Howard & Wyndham, A. Stewart Cruikshank, decided to experiment with a quality show, a cocktail of music, laughter and song, to outmatch the seaside-style summer shows. The show started at 8.30pm and was changed weekly, attracting huge crowds. The record run of 31 weeks under the top billing of Dave Willis remains unbroken in variety history. The first such show was on 5 June 1933, and was imaginatively titled the Half Past Eight Show. This successful summer tradition continued, with changes becoming fortnightly to allow as many people to see it as possible. Howard and Wyndham Ltd acquired the larger Alhambra Theatre in Waterloo Street in 1954, in anticipation of selling their Theatre Royal in Hope Street to Roy Thomson as studios for the launch of the commercial television station STV, and the summer shows were transferred there. Carol Smillie in Hormonal Housewives at The King's Theatre, Glasgow, November 2011 The King's concentrated upon musical plays and drama and in time introduced ballet, Pavlova being greatly popular. Film seasons were introduced before 1914. Pantomime started in the 1960s only after the Alhambra Theatre closed. These lavish shows, originally funded in a joint venture by Glasgow Corporation and Edinburgh Corporation included Stanley Baxter and others. The Christmas pantomime continued as an annual feature, with comedians and actors such as Gerard Kelly and Elaine C. Smith. There is always a healthy rivalry with other Scottish theatres to put on the biggest and best Christmas pantomimes, with the main competition to the King's in Glasgow now being the Pavilion Theatre in Renfield Street. Over the years many actors and actresses have graced the stage of The King's. These included Laurence Olivier, Sarah Bernhardt, Ray Walston, Katharine Hepburn and Tyrone Power. The Jackson Five appeared at a Royal Variety Performance in the late 1970s. In 1967, Howard and Wyndham sold the King's Theatre to Glasgow Corporation in the face of competition from the civic theatre movement, which was attracting Arts Council money. This secured the theatre for the future, as television and colour films had led to the closure of the majority of them in Britain. Around the same period, the theatre gained an extension to the rear as part of the Charing Cross Complex which was built to the west of the building in the early 1970s. However, the King's has been most famous among locals for its annual pantomime - which has starred variety greats such as Stanley Baxter, Jimmy Logan and Rikki Fulton. In 1990 when the City of Glasgow became the first European City of Culture in Britain, the theatre was a main venue, and underwent a programme of major refurbishment. In 2002 the theatre's day-to-day management was transferred to the Ambassador Theatre Group, becoming their first venue in Scotland, although they have since also taken over the management of the Theatre Royal at the opposite end of the city centre as well as the Edinburgh Playhouse. In 2004, the theatre celebrated its centenary, and a one-off documentary on the theatre was broadcast on BBC1 Scotland on 31 January 2003. The programme was presented by Elaine C Smith and featured interviews with Gerard Kelly, Stanley Baxter, Paul O'Grady, Tony Roper, Nicholas Parsons and Johnny Beattie, among others. In 2005, responsibility for production of the pantomime was transferred to the Ambassador Theatre Group subsidiary First Family Entertainment.  The building  View from the Stage Boxes seen from the Grand Circle Frank Matcham made effective use of the prominent corner site in designing the two facades of the building. Originally, an iron canopy, made by the Saracen Foundry in Possilpark, Glasgow, wrapped around the front of the building, although this appears to have been removed by the Second World War, possibly for munitions production. The facade on Bath Street is a mix of styles, with influences of Baroque and Art Nouveau in red Dumfriesshire sandstone. A pair of two storey pavilions stand near either end of the Bath Street elevation, one providing access to the main foyer whilst the other houses the scenery dock, and opens straight onto the stage. The pavilions are topped with ball finials. Originally a female statue stood on top of either pavilion, but these were removed during the war period, to prevent them becoming damaged, however were subsequently misplaced, and have never been rediscovered. The theatre provides seating on four levels - Stalls, Grand Circle, Upper Circle and Gallery. Matcham was famous for his innovative style of cantilever construction of the individual seating tiers, which virtually eliminated the need for supporting pillars, and the King's was no exception, with reasonable sightlines from most seats. Victorian and Edwardian theatres were almost always built to segregate patrons at each level, although subsequent modernisations often eradicate this. This has thus far not been the case in the King's, which still has separate entrances, some of which have traces of former pay boxes, now disused. The standard of seating and decoration is also less luxurious as you get further up the house. The Stalls and Grand Circle are accessed via the small main foyer, which still impresses with its barrel vaulted ceiling, horizontal bands of red and white marble, and decorative plasterwork on the ceilings, including caryatids. The Upper Circle is accessed via a door to a stairwell to the left of the main Bath Street entrance. The Gallery is accessed via a staircase at the back of the building with its own entrance on Elmbank Street. The auditorium seats 1,785. The ceiling panelling fans out from a single centre ceiling rose - each panel originally contained painted scenes, although they are currently plain. The proscenium is surrounded by heavy marble and plasterwork borders. Above the proscenium an elegant design with cherubs flanking a crown and a K/T emblem provides a focal point to the theatre when the curtain is down. The red curtain has simple gilding, but often remains unseen as it is unused for many of today's productions. The seats and drapes are of a rich red material. The safety curtain features a painted design of drapes, and framed in the centre is a projection screen. At Grand Circle level two boxes on either side of the auditorium continue where the grand circle balcony finishes. A further box (now disused) is located at Upper Circle level above this, with an elaborate domed canopy. Three domed alcoves sit along either side of the upper circle. Comedian and actor Billy Connolly famously described it as \\"like performing inside a wedding cake\\". Subsequent alterations to the theatre includes the unfortunate removal of a modern canopy, which ran along most of the Bath Street elevation. This dated from around the 1950s, and was removed in 2004 during a programme of external works, which also included some stone-cleaning and refurbishment. To complement the newly revealed exterior architecture, the facades were floodlit with coloured lights. In 1986, an extension to the western side of the Bath Street elevation provided new dressing room and office accommodation, as well as a new wardrobe room and stage door.  Restoration  In early 2008, the management of the King's Theatre announced that a full programme of interior refurbishment was planned, to restore the theatre to its full former glory, in time for the Commonwealth Games that the city is to host in 2014. Work for this restoration is expected to commence in the Summer of 2009. The firm chosen as Architects for the work are Simpson & Brown. The theatre had its Stalls & Grand Circle seating replaced during the autumn 2009, with an authentic style appropriate to the theatre. The stalls has improved legroom and no centre aisle, improving sightlines. The theatre is offering patrons the opportunity to sponsor a seat, with the price including a membership to the Friends scheme that the theatre operates. Other restoration work includes new carpet within the auditorium, new orchestra pit railing, and preparations for the installation of air conditioning.

Biography Born to Sally and Irving Chestman, Russian-Jewish immigrants, she grew up with three siblings on Manhattan's West Side during the 1920s and 1930s. She spoke little about her childhood and left home at age 15 to work in the theater, adopting the name Faith Elliott. At age 18, she moved to Hollywood, starting as a messenger at Columbia Pictures. She subsequently worked as a sound-effects and music editor, and then script clerk for Republic Pictures. She later worked as a script supervisor (12 Angry Men) and editor (Go, Man, Go; with the Harlem Globetrotters). Career The Hubleys jointly founded Storyboard Studios as an independent animation studio, vowing to make one independent film a year. They collaborated on more than 20 short films, up until John's death during open-heart surgery in 1977. At that time they were working on the Doonesbury television cartoon, A Doonesbury Special. Faith Hubley, with Garry Trudeau and Bill Littlejohn, completed the special despite the doubts of NBC executives. The Hubleys won Oscars for their shorts: Moonbird (1959), The Hole (1962) and A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature (1966); they also received Oscar nominations for Windy Day, Of Men and Demons, Voyage to Next and A Doonesbury Special. Her many solo projects established her as a significant film creator in her own right. She began her first solo project, W.O.W. (Women of the World), after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1975. Between 1976 and 2001, she completed 24 further solo animated films. Her films often feature abstract imagery and non- linear stories; many draw on themes of mythology and indigenous art. She was also a painter, with her works being exhibited in galleries in Europe and the United States. Unlike conventional hand-drawn animation where a camera takes pictures of paintings on celluloid that are lit from above, she used a technique were drawings on paper were illuminated from below, giving the animation a special look.Profile, moma.org; accessed February 10, 2015. Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved several of Faith Hubley's films, including A Smattering of Spots, A Doonesbury Special, and The Hole. Awards Faith Hubley received honors from the Cannes, Venice, London, and San Francisco film festivals. She won fourteen CINE Golden Eagle awards, and received honorary doctorates from the University of Chicago, Columbia College, and Hofstra University. Her 1981 animated film \\"Enter Life\\" can be seen at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, as part of the Early Life exhibit. In 1995, the National Gallery of Art presented a retrospective program of her works. Death Faith Hubley died in 2001, aged 77, in New Haven, Connecticut, following her long battle with breast cancer, 26 years after her initial diagnosis. Family She married John Hubley in 1955. The couple had four children: Mark Hubley, animator Emily Hubley, musician/artist Georgia Hubley, and Hamp Hubley. Their children's voices were featured in a number of their films.

As of July 2016, Pantip.com one of the top 10 websites in Thailand and 712 worldwide. Discussions about Thai politics and current events on Pantip.com's topic boards are often cited in the Thai press, particularly in such English- language newspapers as the Bangkok Post and The Nation, as a gauge of the public's mood about various issues. At the beginning, the site gained its popularity from people's misunderstanding of its name which is similar (and identical in English) to Bangkok's format IT shopping center, Pantip Plaza, but it is in no way affiliated with the mall.

Along with the popular Thai-language portal Sanook.com, Pantip.com was one of the first websites established in Thailand when the Internet was being introduced in the country. As opposed to Sanook.com's lucrative buyout from MWeb, a now-defunct dot com company, Wanchat has no plans to sell the site. Wanchat Padungrat, Web Gardener (in Thai)Wanchat Padungrut the man behind Thailand's most acclaimed website (in Thai) Community =Tables= One of the features of the site is the \\"Caf√©\\", which consists of 20 \\"tables\\" for discussions on a variety of topics. The tables are named after famous places in Thailand, such as Siam Square, MBK Center, Silom and Chatuchak Weekend Market. Topics for discussion include politics, religion, celebrities and education as well as films, sports and outdoor recreation. Other features include LiveChat, Pantip Market, PanTown, Game Room, E-Card, BlogGang and Pantip Musicstation. =Membership system= Pantip.com believes that its members should be held accountable for what they write on its webboard in order to avoid unpleasant exchanges that often bring about defamation, rudeness, or simply unhealthy cyber environment for its members. Thus, since 2004 it has started requiring that new members must provide their IDs (Thai National ID or passport number) in order to subscribe for a membership. At first, this measure had received a lot of criticism, with concerns about privacy and security of personal information. However, such criticisms have subsided as there has been no indication of any harm yet. Apparently, Pantip.com is one of the few, if any, online webboards that have such stiff requirements involving personal identity of the member. According to Wanchat, the outcome of such measure is quite satisfying, the members are contented with the improved quality of the discussion and the membership has grown. Alternatively, people who do not wish to apply as a member can still post using a temporary ticket-pass that only requires an e-mail address. Ticket-pass holders do not enjoy some special benefits of members, such as intra-communication tools and blog. Recently, in Ratchadumnern table, where heated and uncivil political debates often occur, Pantip.com has started requiring that every post there must be accompanied by member login only. Thus, everyone who wishes to post in Ratchadumnern table must have member login name. However, the problem of using false identification or IDs of other people to apply for membership is still pervasive. =Netiquette= The forum has rules, or \\"netiquette\\", which are actively enforced. Offensive posts can be reported to the webmaster, who may remove the offending post to the \\"trash\\" page, where the pages can still be viewed and commented on. The rules are: # Messages critical of the king and the royal family are absolutely prohibited. # No foul language or sexually explicit content. # No insults or posts that may cause a person to be hated. # No posts that are solely intended to cause quarrels or chaos. # No negative attacks on religions or the teachings of any religion. # Don't use pseudonyms that resemble somebody else's real name with the intention of misleading others. # No messages that might cause conflicts among educational institutions. # No posts containing personal data of others, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers. =Famous members= There are people from all walks of life who participate in Pantip.com as members, ticket pass- holders, or just readers. Among them are many famous people in Thai society who publicly acknowledge their membership in Pantip.com. They include: * Police Colonel Yannapol Youngyuen ‚Äì Commander, the Bureau of Technology and Cyber Crime, Department Special Investigation (DSI) * M.C.

Several posters have landed book deals as a consequence of writing on Pantip.com. On the other hand, a lot of people have become infamous when their blunders were exposed. Examples include writers who plagiarize the works of others, famous quiz shows such as Fan Pan Tae and Tod Sa Gun Game which give wrong answers repeatedly, and unscrupulous companies that cheat customers or individuals who use Pantip.com strictly for self- promotion. While Pantip.com members have different views ideologies, sometimes they will come together to protect fellow members whom they think are unfairly attacked from outsiders. The most prominent example is a careless teenager who inadvertently posted a nude picture of a Thai actress (although he covered her breasts before posting) which landed him in a police station's cell.Interview with the Scapegoat?, manager online The whole Chalermthai movie and entertainment board, where the picture was posted, banded together to defend the poster whom they think was just a scapegoat in a plot to raise publicity for the actress' next movie. The actress and her company was heavily criticized and there were a collective threat not to see any of her future movies. Finally after the poster made a public apology, she dropped the case and he was set free.

Constructed in 1929 as a cinema, it is one of several theatres in the city centre and one of two owned by the Ambassador Theatre Group. The building was converted for full-time use as a theatre in 1999, and since then has hosted a number of shows and musicals. The theatre is also the northern base for the Glyndebourne Touring Opera. History =20th Century= The building was originally opened as a cinema, having been commissioned by Provincial Cinematograph Theatres. The Regent was one of a number of \\"Regents\\" built across the country by the company, including one in Bournemouth, Brighton and Bristol. The building was designed by William E. Trent and opened in 1929 by the Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent, William Leason. The building was not only designed for cinema use, but for cine-variety with the stage being used in its early years to host stage performances in-between films. A Wurtlizer organ was also installed. In 1950, The Regent, by this point owned by Gaumont British, was renamed The Gaumont and began to host local amateur dramatic performances following the closure of the nearby Theatre Royal. The Gaumont also hosted live concerts, including performances by Shirley Bassey, Cliff Richard, Stevie Wonder and The Beatles. The building was converted into a three screen cinema and renamed The Gaumont Film Centre in 1974, before being taken over by Odeon in 1976. The success of the venue in the eighties led to the construction of a new eight screen Odeon multiplex in 1989, with the old building closing. =Renovation and 21st Century= By the late 1990s, the building's condition had deteriorated and the interior dome had suffered from extensive water damage. The 'Regent Theatre Trust' was set up to manage the renovation and restoration of the building by a small grouped headed by Richard Talbot, before the council took over the redevelopment as part of its Cultural Quarter scheme. The original stage house and part of the auditorium were demolished, and a new stage, backstage facilities and orchestra pit built. The auditorium was restored, with a new proscenium arch constructed, alongside new front-of- house facilities and full disabled access. Following a three-year, ¬£23 million development, The Regent held a preopening concert performed by The Porthill Players, a local amateur dramatic society and it was then officially reopened on 22 September 1999 with a performance of the national tour of Annie. Elizabeth II officially opened The Regent Theatre in October 1999. Since reopening in 1999, the theatre has presented numerous national tours: Thoroughly Modern Millie, Cats, Starlight Express, 42nd Street and The Woman in Black. The theatre also hosts an annual pantomime, frequently starring local celebrity Jonathan Wilkes. Architecture The theatre is built in the Art Deco style. Its frontage is clad in white glazed terracotta, featuring mask representations of comedy and tragedy in each corner.

Monneba, also spelled Moneba and other ways, (fl. c. 1630) was a local Duala leader on the Cameroon coast in the 1630s. Dutch sources from the 1660s say that Monneba ran a trading post on the Cameroons River (the Wouri) at the present location of Douala. His people dealt primarily in ivory, with some slaves. Modern scholars equate Monneba with a Duala ruler named Mulobe a Ewale or Mulabe a Ewale. Assuming this is true, he is the earliest Duala leader of whom we have corroboration in written sources. It is quite possible that Monneba/Mulobe was the ruler who set into motion the transformation of the Duala into a trading people and the most influential ethnic group in early Cameroonian history.Ardener and Ardener 362. Monneba in European sources Dutch sources from the early 17th century provide some insight into nascent European trade on the Cameroons River (Wouri) at the present site of Douala. Arnout Leers, probably drawing from writings by Samuel Blommaert in the 1630s, is the first writer to mention Monneba: Euro-Cameroon trade was in its infancy, and these customs duties indicate that Monneba's trading post was of lesser import than that of a leader called Samson (probably an Ibibio) on the Rio del Rey farther north.Austen and Derrick 17‚Äì18. Rulers farther south in Gaboon (Gabon) received even more custom.Ardener 20‚Äì1. Dutch maps from the 1650s clearly label Monneba's Village (Monna Baes dorp ),Ardener 24. located on the site of Belltown in Douala. The maps also place Monneba's name on the Dibamba River, which is called Monneba's Creek or Channel (Monnebasa Gat).Austen and Derrick 17. O. Dapper writing in 1668 (also drawing from Blommaert) explains that by that date Samson had been driven out by \\"those of Ambo\\" (Ambas Bay) and Monneba had become the lead trader in the region: Dapper also describes Monneba's people: By this time, Dutch trade on the Guinea coast had been regularised, and ships carried detailed instructions for reaching the various trading posts, including Monneba's Village.Ardener 23. Nevertheless, trade remained minimal and infrequent. As late as 1739, letters and ships' logs show that Dutch merchants on the Cameroon coast were trading almost solely with the Duala in their settlement on the Wouri, which they still referred to as \\"Monneba's Village\\".Austen and Derrick 19. Trade was mostly in ivory, with some slaves.Austen and Derrick 23. Monneba himself was still thought to be the ruler there, as Bardot wrote in 1732 (probably using Dapper as the source): \\"The lands opposite to the latter places, on the north of Rio Camerones, are inhabited by the Calbonges, . . . governed by a chief of their own tribe, called by them Moneba . . . .\\"Quoted in Ardener 15. Not until King Joss in the late 1780s do European sources name another ruler from the Douala area. Connection with Mulobe a Ewale Edwin Ardener equates Monneba with the Duala leader referred to in traditional genealogies as Mulobe a Ewale or Mulabe a Ewale.Ardener 16. This individual is placed one generation after Ewale a Mbedi, the eponymous father of the Duala people. Later academics Austen and Derrick accept the Monneba/Mulabe connection as \\"very reasonable\\".Austen and Derrick 15. There is no doubt that Monneba's Village is in fact Douala. The location on Dutch maps is clearly on the Wouri River at about the location of Belltown, one of the various townships that made up Douala in the precolonial period. Leers and Blommaert give examples of the language spoken by Monneba and his people, and it is obviously that of the Duala. The connection also makes temporal sense. If one starts from the first incontestable Duala leaders known from modern sources and traces their purported genealogy back allowing 25 years for each generation, Mulobe seems to have lived at the same time Dutch sources first mention Monneba.

Life and career McCord was born in Montreal to a family of lawyers and businessmen of Irish origin who had emigrated to Canada around the year 1760. He was the fourth child of John Samuel McCord (1801‚Äì1865), Judge of the Supreme Court, and Anne Ross, a daughter of David Ross (1770‚Äì1837) Q.C., of Montreal, Seigneur of St. Gilles de Beaurivage. His parents, in an upper class, bilingual marriage, inculcated in McCord a love of art (his father was a connoisseur and his mother was an accomplished watercolour artist) and science from an early age. Educated at the High School of Montreal, on leaving school he decided to continue the family tradition and study law at McGill University, eventually becoming a magistrate who gained fame by intervening on behalf of the Aboriginal peoples in Canada. In 1878 McCord proposed the establishment of a national museum for Canadian history in his maternal city. His collection was first housed in his home and in 1919 his \\"collection was moved to Jesse Joseph House on the McGill University campus. On October 13, 1921 the McCord Museum opened its doors with a collection of 15,000 artifacts from McCord's personal collections. Nine years later, McCord died in Guelph, Ontario. Upon his death, the university took charge of the museum, which today has more than 1.2 million objects. McCord married Letitia Caroline Chambers (1841‚Äì1928). They lived at the old McCord family home, Temple Grove, on the C√¥te-des-Neiges, Montreal. They are buried together in the Mount Royal Cemetery. The eponymous museum founded by David McCord. In 2005, the Government of Canada Historic Sites and Monuments Board, placed a plaque outside the McCord Museum in Montreal that reads: David McCord created one of the earliest and most important collections of objects, images and manuscripts associated with the history of Canada. Convinced that an understanding of the past strengthens national identity, he devoted most of his life and personal fortune to gathering and documenting some 15,000 items related to Aboriginal, French and British history in North America. This man of vision bequeathed his outstanding collection to McGill University, which fulfilled his dream of founding a museum for the benefit of all Canadians.

Life Born on 27 April 1941 in Siegmar-Sch√∂nau (since July 1951 incorporated into Chemnitz), Goldmann's music education began in 1951 when he joined the Dresdner Kreuzchor. At age 18, he received a scholarship by the city of Darmstadt to study composition with Karlheinz Stockhausen at the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik in 1959, who further encouraged him over the following years . He moved on to study composition at the Dresden Conservatory from 1959, taking his exam two years early in 1962. From 1962 until 1964 he attended a master class at the Academy of Arts, Berlin with Rudolph Wagner-R√©geny. Around this time, he worked as a freelance music assistant at the Berliner Ensemble where he befriended other composers and writers, including Heiner M√ºller, Luigi Nono and Luca Lombardi. He also met Paul Dessau, who became a close friend and mentor. From 1964 until 1968 he studied musicology at Humboldt University of Berlin, after which he worked as a freelance composer and conductor . Major commissions include works for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Semperoper Dresden, the Berlin Staatsoper, three works for Wittener Tage f√ºr neue Kammermusik, Ensemble Modern, Arditti Quartet, Komische Oper Berlin, the 20th anniversary celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Expo 2000 in Hannover, several works for Konzerthaus Berlin and the German radio orchestras . As a conductor, he worked with several orchestras and ensembles, including the Berliner Philharmoniker (with which he recorded Stockhausen's Gruppen, Deutsche Grammophon DG 447 761-2 / 940 462-2; reissued as 001708102), the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the Staatskapelle Berlin (including a production of Sch√∂nberg's Moses und Aron, directed by Ruth Berghaus, in 1987), the Gruppe Neue Musik Hanns Eisler, and the Scharoun Ensemble. He also performed all over Europe, Russia, the United States, Japan, and South Korea. He had a close working relationship with Ensemble Modern from the first days of the ensemble's formation. Their collaborations included a tour of Russia, the French and West German premieres of Luigi Nono's Prometeo, as well as performances and recordings of Goldmann's own works . From 1988 he was the principal conductor of the Boris Blacher Ensemble in Berlin Recordings of his and other composers‚Äô music have been released by Nova, Wergo, Deutsche Grammophon, Academy, Edel Classics, RCA, BMG and other labels . Other conductors who have performed his works include Pierre Boulez, Daniel Barenboim, Michael Gielen, Mark Elder, Ernest Bour and Ingo Metzmacher From 1980 until 1991, he taught master classes at Berlin's Akademie der K√ºnste. In 1991 he became a professor of composition at the Hochschule der K√ºnste, Berlin (now Universit√§t der K√ºnste) . There, he headed the Institute for New Music from 2003 until 2005 (Press release by the Institute of New Music). Among his students were Enno Poppe, Helmut Oehring, Nicolaus Richter de Vroe, Steffen Schleiermacher, Chatschatur Kanajan, H. Johannes Wallmann, Jakob Ullmann, Charlotte Seither, Arnulf Herrmann, Paul Frick and Sergej Newski . He was a member of the Academies of Fine Arts of East Berlin (from 1978) and of West Berlin (from 1990, before the unification of both academies), and Dresden (from 1995). He was also a member of the German-French Cultural Council, and Deutscher Musikrat (German Music Council, a member of the International Music Council). From 1990 until 1997 he was president of the German section of the International Society of Contemporary Music (ISCM) (; ) Awards include the Hanns-Eisler-Preis, Kulturpreis and Nationalpreis of the GDR . Friedrich Goldmann died in Berlin on 24 July 2009 (; ). He was 68 years old. His grave is located at Berlin's Dorotheenst√§dtischer Friedhof cemetery . Currently the majority of his autograph scores are located at the archive of Berlin's Akademie der K√ºnste . Works Goldmann wrote more than 200 compositions. They include chamber music, solo concertos, orchestral works including four symphonies, stage and film music scores as well as one opera, R.Hot oder Die Hitze . A comprehensive list of works can be found on the composer's website . His output can be divided roughly into three creative periods. His early works from 1963 up to the beginning of the 1970s include several works for the stage as well as chamber music and three \\"Essays\\" for orchestra. In these he initially employed serial and cluster techniques, claiming later that he considered most of them \\"to be thrown away.\\" Around 1969 Goldmann developed a technique of appropriating established musical forms (such as sonata, symphony, string quartet, etc.) and \\"breaking them open from within\\", thereby changing their impact and meaning . Important examples of this phase are Bl√§sersonate (1969) and Symphony No. 1 (1971), both of which are major early examples of the deconstruction of the idea of linear progress in new music since the 1970s . From the end of the 1970s a new tendency evolved that would dominate his third creative period, especially from the late 1990s: autonomous, \\"absolute\\" composition . Instead of working with discrepancies, as in \\"polystylism\\" or in his previous works, for instance, Goldmann sought interactions and integrations of techniques and material. This approach aims at overcoming assumed antagonisms between different ‚Äúlayers of material.‚Äù Within the resulting consistent shapes formed from transitions between tones, microtones, and noise, assumed parameter boundaries are meant to dissolve perceptually‚Äîthus challenging the concept of musical material as a set of stable entities. Important examples are the String Quartet No. 2 (1997), the Quartet for Oboe, Violin, Viola and Violoncello (2000), and Quasi una sinfonia (2008) .

Although \\"Bells\\" was the first to be broadcast on BBC1, it was originally destined to be the second episode.Blackadder Hall.co.uk, URL accessed 12 December 2013 The plot of the episode, of a young woman disguising herself as a man to go into service and falling in love with her employer, is particularly based on a significant plot thread of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.Blackadder: Bells at bbc.co.uk Plot Kate, an attractive young woman, is attempting to comfort her father upon her mother's death ‚Äì even though her mother is alive and has run off with Kate's uncle and is living in Droitwich, leaving them destitute. He suggests that Kate become a prostitute to solve their money troubles. Kate refuses indignantly and decides to go to London to seek her fortune, over her father's objections (\\"Why walk all the way to London when you can make a fortune lying on your back?!\\"). Lord Blackadder is at home, target practising with his bow and arrow (his servant, Baldrick, is holding the target). Hanger-on Lord Percy enters and announces that he is in love with Jane Harrington. Blackadder remarks casually that he and Baldrick had both slept with her, which throws Percy's aim off and he shoots Baldrick in the groin with an arrow. Kate enters, disguised as a boy, introduces herself as \\"Bob,\\" and asks to be accepted into Blackadder's service. Blackadder hires her on the spot, firing Baldrick in the process. However, Baldrick is allowed to stay and work for Blackadder, as long as he works a bit harder and lives in the gutter. Over the next few weeks Lord Blackadder finds himself strangely attracted to his new servant and spends a great deal of time with \\"Bob\\". Lord Melchett and the Queen are concerned by this, and even Blackadder himself begins to worry after he nearly kisses \\"Bob\\" during a friendly tussle. He seeks advice from a doctor, who prescribes leeches to be dissolved in his mouth,aph.gov Official Hansard section 9285 (pdf) . Retrieved 29 November 2007 and (on Baldrick's advice) consults the Wise Woman, who gives him three options: 1) kill Bob; 2) commit suicide; or 3) go ahead and sleep with Bob and, to ensure no one ever finds out, kill everyone in the entire world. With no other options, Blackadder orders Bob out of his service, but the truth is revealed (along with \\"Bob's\\" breasts) and after a very brief sexual encounter Blackadder asks Bob/Kate to marry him. She accepts, and the Queen consents, after being reassured that Kate's nose is not prettier than hers. Baldrick is chosen as Kate's bridesmaid, while Edmund's choice for best man is his old school chum, Lord Flashheart, \\"the best sword, the best shot, the best sailor and the best kisser in the Kingdom\\". The wedding service does not go as smoothly as planned. Edmund bribes Kate's father to leave before anyone sees him, and Lord Flashheart has not shown up. With no best man, Blackadder reluctantly asks Percy to fill in. At that moment Flashheart crashes through the roof, throws Percy out, and begins chatting up every woman in the room, including Nursie and Baldrick. He is quite taken with \\"Bob\\" and proceeds to steal her from Blackadder. The two of them swap clothes as Kate reveals she now prefers boys' clothing and Flashheart prefers dresses, announce they are running away together, set off a bomb, and disappear. Melchett reminds Edmund that in such circumstances, it is customary for the groom to marry the bridesmaid, a suggestion positively received by Baldrick.

He worked as a professor of composition, founded a centre for contemporary music in Dresden, and was director of the Leipzig Opera and the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He directed a contemporary music series for the Bayerischer Rundfunk and a European centre of the arts in Hellerau. His operas, especially Wei√üe Rose, on a topic he set to music twice, have been performed internationally and recorded.  Biography  Born in Dresden, Zimmermann was a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor from 1954 to 1962, when he completed the Abitur. Directed by Rudolf Mauersberger, Zimmermann was immersed in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and learned vocal expression, which became a focus of his own compositions. He wrote three motets which were performed by the choir, including a \\"Vaterunserlied\\" in 1959. Education in the choir fostered a humanitarian attitude which he kept for life. He continued his music education at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber, studying composition with Johannes Paul Thilman and also voice and conducting. The works composed during these years include Dramatische Impression f√ºr Violoncello und Klavier auf den Tod von J. F. Kennedy (Dramatic impression for cello and piano on the death of John F. Kennedy), composed in 1963, F√ºnf Ges√§nge f√ºr Bariton und Kammerorchester (Wolfgang Borchert) (Five chants for baritone and chamber orchestra after Wolfgang Borchert), written in 1964, and the opera Wei√üe Rose based on a libretto by his brother and composed in 1967/68. The theme of the opera, which he composed as a student, is the White Rose resistance movement of the siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl. From 1968, he studied in Berlin at the Akademie der K√ºnste with G√ºnter Kochan. In the same year he composed Musik f√ºr Streicher (Music for strings), his first work including twelve-tone technique and a new organisation of sound processes in levels (\\"fl√§chig)\\". In 1970, Zimmermann became dramaturge of the Staatsoper Dresden. In 1978 he was appointed professor of composition at the Dresdnen Musikhochschule, where he had lectured from 1976. As a conductor, he was invited by major orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony, Staatskapelle Dresden, Gewandhausorchester in Leipzig, Orchestre de Radio France in Paris, Tonhalle Orchestra in Zurich, Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, NDR Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg, Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra, Warsaw Philharmonic, MDR Symphony Orchestra, and the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared as a guest conductor at opera houses in Bonn, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna. He organised productions of his operas in both East and West Germany, and arranged for leading papers to review them. In 1986, he founded the Dresdner Zentrum f√ºr zeitgen√∂ssische Musik (Dresden Center for Contemporary Music) as a research center and for concerts and festivals. He returned to his opera topic Wei√üe Rose and wrote a condensed version for only two voices and ensemble on a text by Wolfgang Willaschek. It premiered at the Opera Stabile, Hamburg, on 27 February 1986, and was staged often. Zimmermann was the artistic director of the Leipzig Opera. During this time, 27 premieres of new works were performed at the house, including several especially for the tricentenary of the opera house. Parts of Stockhausen's Licht were premiered, also J√∂rg Herchet's nachtwache, staged by Ruth Berghaus, and Dieter Schnebel's \\"Majakowskis Tod ‚Äì Totentanz\\". The house received international attention, presenting Busoni's Doktor Faust staged by Willy Decker, and a cycle of Mozart's operas on librettos by da Ponte, staged by John Dew, among others. From 2001 to 2003 he was general director of the Deutsche Oper Berlin. Zimmermann directed the series musica viva of contemporary music, run by the broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk from 1997 to 2011. He invited notable composers and ensembles to concerts in Munich, many of which were recorded. In 2007/08, he initiated an additional ars musica viva festival, which presented leading radio orchestras and ensembles. The BMW Kompositionspreises, a composition prize for the series, was an award for many new works by young international composers. A total of 175 works were performed, with 161 compositions commissioned by musica viva, and presented in 180 broadcasts. Zimmermann received the broadcaster's Gold Medal for his work over 14 years. Zimmermann then directed the Europ√§isches Zentrum der K√ºnste in Dresden-Hellerau (European centre of the arts in Dresden-Hellerau), with a vision of a laboratory for contemporary art (\\"Labor f√ºr zeitgen√∂ssische Kunst\\"), including theatre, dance, architecture, art and media art. He retired from the position in 2008.  Operas  Zimmermann's operas were published by Breitkopf: * Wei√üe Rose (1967/1968), opera in eight Bildern (scenes, literally \\"images\\") based on a libretto by his brother Ingo Zimmermann, premiered 17 June 1967 * ' (1970), opera in seven Bildern and three interludes based on a libretto by Ingo Zimmermann * ' (1972), opera in nine Bildern based on the novel by Johannes Bobrowski, libretto by Ingo Zimmermann, premiered 27 March 1973 at the Staatsoper Dresden * Der Schuhu und die fliegende Prinzessin (1976), fairy- tale opera after Peter Hacks in three Abteilungen (divisions), libretto by Udo Zimmermann and Eberhard Schmidt, premiered 30 December 1976 at the Staatsoper Dresden, and a first performance in the West on 13 May 1977 at the Staatstheater Darmstadt * Die wundersame Schustersfrau (1982), opera in two acts after Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, premiered 25 April 1982 at the Schlosstheater Schwetzingen * Wei√üe Rose (1986), chamber opera, scenes for two singers and 15 instrumentalists after texts by Wolfgang Willaschek, premiered 27 February 1986 at the Opera Stabile, Hamburg * ' (1988)  Publications  Zimmermann's publications are held by the German National Library, including: *Man sieht, was man h√∂rt (One sees what one hears), Udo Zimmermann on music and theatre, edited by Frank Gei√üler, Leipzig 2003.

Both had previously performed as the only white members in Minneapolis soul singer Alexander O'Neal's band. Saxophonist Eric Moen, bass guitarist Al Wolovitch, and drummer Andrew Kamman rounded out the group, which formed in the late ‚Äò70s and took its name from a character on Steamroller, a local public-access television comedy show that Himmelman hosted. The members of Sussman Lawrence had all gone to junior high school together in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park. Heavily influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley, Himmelman (who also performed with Shangoya where he added a 'rock-guitar' flavor to the Caribbean sound) brought a pronounced reggae/ska flavor to their debut album Hail To The Modern Hero! and then embellished it on the more polished and ambitiously pop-oriented follow up, the double LP Pop City. Both albums fueled Sussman Lawrence's incendiary live shows with such fan favorites as ‚ÄúHouse on Fire,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Let Me Be Your Cigarette,‚Äù ‚ÄúCloser, Closer,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Fifth of August‚Äù‚Äîa love song that would resurface on Himmelman's 1994 album Skin. Searching for greater glory, Sussman Lawrence left the midwest in 1984 for the east coast. Settling in Ridgewood, New Jersey, the band gained a foothold in the thriving Manhattan concert scene with their way-over-the-top live shows. Himmelman's writing, however, was beginning to take a turn inward, as evidenced on his first solo album This Father's Day, which was independently released in 1985 and then re-released by Island Records the following year. Recorded with the same band he'd been with since 1979, Sussman Lawrence then became The Peter Himmelman Band. Peter Himmelman would go on as a solo recording artist. Now based in Los Angeles, he has branched out, composing popular children's records and award-winning music for film and television‚Äîmost notably the hit CBS drama Judging Amy. Also in L.A. are Andy Kamman, who moved on to play drums for Vonda Shepard and the recording group Uma, and Al Wolovitch, who is a scorer of TV shows and commercials in his own right.

After the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, the layout of the Roman settlement became the approximate blueprint of the Saxon and medieval city. This ancient core of London is known as the City of London with Westminster, the ancient centre of political power in London, lying to the west. Relatively few structures survive from London's medieval past due to the city's near-total destruction in the Great Fire of 1666, but notable survivors include the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Hall, Guildhall, St James's Palace, Lambeth Palace and a handful of scattered Tudor survivals. After the Great Fire, London was transformed as it was rebuilt and greatly modernised under the direction of the baroque architect Sir Christopher Wren, with the new St Paul's Cathedral as its centrepiece. Queens House (1633) Indigo Jones (centre) and Old Royal Naval College (1712) Christopher Wren, poignant examples of Palladian and Baroque Architecture in London. After a period of dramatic expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries, London reached its zenith as the world's largest and populous city from 1831 to 1925, as well as being the capital of the British Empire at its greatest extent and power. In this period London sprawled vastly beyond its historical boundaries, absorbing many formerly rural settlements and creating vast suburbs. The city was also transformed by substantial infrastructure projects like the West India Docks which affirmed London's status as a major port, a system of canals including the Regent's Canal, a modern sewage system, some of the world's first intercity railway termini such as Paddington Station and the world's first underground railway system. These innovations set London apart as the pre-eminent city of the industrial age. After suffering significant destruction during the The Blitz of World War II and a period of economic decline in the post-war period, London is once again a global capital of culture and commerce, with much new development adding to its eclectic cityscape.Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The terraced house is an iconic symbol of traditional housing in London. London contains a very wide variety of architectural styles from a variety of historical periods. London's great architectural eclecticism stems from its long history, constant redevelopment, destruction caused by The Blitz and state recognition of private property rights which often prevented large scale state planning. This sets London apart from other great European capitals like Paris, Vienna and Rome which are more architecturally homogenous and centrally planned by the state. London's eclectic architectural heritage ranges from Roman archaeological remains, the great medieval fortress of the Tower of London, the 13th-century gothic of Westminster Abbey, the baroque of St Paul's Cathedral, the neoclassicism of Somerset House, the grand urban set piece of Regent Street, the Victorian High Gothic of St Pancras railway station, the art deco Hoover Building, the brutalism of the Barbican Estate and the high- tech skyscraper 30 St Mary Axe.Palace of Westminster (1840‚Äì70) by Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin, an archetypal work of the victorian Gothic Revival movement. Being the capital of the United Kingdom, London contains many of the most important buildings of the British State, The Monarchy and The Church of England. These include the Palace of Westminster; the centre of British democracy, Buckingham Palace; the official residence of the British Monarchy and Westminster Abbey; the site of all coronations of English and British monarchs since 1066. London also contains numerous monuments such as the ancient heart of London at London Stone, the 17th-century Monument to the Great Fire of London, Marble Arch, Wellington Arch, the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is an internationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, often regarded as the centre of London. The Royal National Theatre (1976) Denys Lasdun, an iconic example of the controversial Brutalist style which was strongly associated with London's post war reconstruction. Throughout most of London's history, the height of buildings has been restricted. These restrictions gradually eroded in the post-war period (except those protecting certain views of St Paul's Cathedral) and high rise buildings have become ever more numerous since, particularly in the 21st century. Skyscrapers are now numerous in the City of London financial district and Canary Wharf: a new financial district created in the 1980s and 90s in the former London docklands area of the Isle of Dogs. Notable recent tall buildings include the 1980s skyscraper Tower 42, the radical Lloyd's building by Richard Rogers, One Canada Square; the centre piece of the Canary Wharf district and 30 St Mary Axe (nicknamed the \\"Gherkin\\") which has set a precedent for other recent high-rise developments built in a similar high-tech style. Renzo Piano's The Shard completed in 2012 is the tallest building in London and for many years in the European Union, as well as the sixth-tallest building in Europe and the 96th-tallest building in the world Since 2004, the London Festival of Architecture is held in June and focuses on the importance of architecture and design in London today. One quarter of UK architects operate from London, with the majority of the most high-profile global practices based in London including Zaha Hadid Architects, Foster and Partners, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, David Chipperfield and David Adjaye among the most well known internationally. In September Open House weekend offers an annual opportunity to visit architecture normally closed to the public free of charge, ranging from grand public buildings such as the Bank of England to contemporary private housing.30 St Mary Axe 'The Gherkin', 20 Fenchurch Street 'The Walkie Talkie' and 122 Leadenhall Street 'The Cheesegrater'. Prehistoric Although no pre-Roman settlement is known, there were prehistoric crossing points at Deptford and also at Vauxhall Bridge, and some prehistoric remains are known from archaeology of the River Thames. It is likely that the course of Watling Street follows a more ancient pathway. Ancient Welsh legend claims the city of the Trinovantes ‚Äì dedicated to the god Lud (Caer Llud) ‚Äì was founded by the followers of Br√¢n the Blessed, whose severed head is said to be buried under the White Tower facing the continent. Roman London (60‚Äì500 CE)National Theatre, London.jpg The urban plan of Londinium continues to inform the development of London over 2000 years later. Londinium was initially founded as a military trading port, while the first capital of the province was at Camulodunum. But after the Boudican Revolt of 61, when both cities were razed to the ground, the capital was removed to London, which rapidly grew to pre-eminence with the establishment of a Forum and a provincial Praetorium. The city was originally laid out to a classical plan like many other cities in Britannia and throughout Europe, in a roughly rectangular form with the south side formed by the River Thames, and divided into blocks of insulae.London Archaeology; Vol 15 Spring 2018 Two east‚Äìwest streets (now Cheapside and Lower Thames Street) led from Newgate and Ludgate to form the cardo, presumably leading to a lost gate (or gates) at the present location of the Tower of London with the road to Canterbury and Dover. An extension of Watling Street formed the decumanus maximus, crossing the river from Billingsgate over the ancient London Bridge to Southwark and the south coast road beyond. The Forum was located at the current site of Leadenhall Market, and is said to have been the largest building north of the Alps in ancient times; remains can still be visited in the basement of some of the market shops. The rectangular walled and gridded city was soon extended to the west over the River Walbrook, north towards marshy Moorfields and east to the area later known as Minories,London Archaeology, Ibid where a Romano- British tomb sculpture of an eagle was found in 2013, suggesting the site lay outside the city boundary in the early second century. A significant portion of the amphitheatre remains beneath the London Guildhall square and a Roman bathing complex is accessible in the basement of 100 Lower Thames Street. The square Castrum was located at the north-east of the city at the Barbican, close to the Museum of London where significant sections of the Roman London Wall remain. For centuries afterward, distances from London were reckoned from the London Stone, claimed in the past to be a fragment of ancient masonry from the ancient Thames-side Governor's Palace, though this cannot now be verified. Late Roman private houses of leading Christians are thought to have been the foundation of the earliest churches; mosaic remains in the crypt at All Hallows by the Tower and may also have been present at St Pauls Cathedral ‚Äì its growing significance over centuries has distorted the once-straight strada on which the site once stood.  The Middle Ages: Norman, Gothic and Tudor architecture (1066‚Äì1603)  Panorama of London in 1616 by Claes Jansz. Visscher. Old London Bridge (1209) complete with its own street of houses can be seen on the right with Southwark Cathedral next to its southern gatehouse. Old St Paul's Cathedral without its spire (which was destroyed by lightning in the 16th century) dominates the skyline alongside the city churches. Note the large amount of shipping on the river; the Thames was an important means of transportation within the medieval city, as well as providing access to international trade.Little remains of London's medieval architecture due to the city's near-complete destruction in The Great Fire of 1666 but a few scattered survivors as well as other records provide a vivid picture of the city in this period. In the middle ages London lay predominantly within the boundaries of the city walls originally built by the Romans ‚Äì the area now known as The City of London ‚Äì with Westminster being a separate smaller settlement to the west. Some aristocratic houses were constructed along the Strand which connected the two settlements. There was also some development on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark with the famous London Bridge connecting the district to the rest of London as well as being the gateway to the South East of England. The earliest record of London bridge dates from the 10th century, a structure probably built of wood, but the most famous incarnation of this bridge was constructed between 1176 and 1209. This was a stone bridge 900 ft wide and consisting of 19 arches, complete with its own street of shops, houses, a chapel and a drawbridge in the centre to allow large boat traffic pass through. The River Thames was an important means of transportation within the city, as well as providing access to overseas trade by sea, with many wharfs and quays built along the north bank of the river. = Norman and Gothic Architecture = Many of medieval London's most significant structures were initially constructed by the Normans, who recognised the importance of architecture as a means of demonstrating their power and of subordinating the native Saxon population after their conquest of England. The Norman conquest was a major turning point in the history of English architecture as they brought with them a new European Romanesque style and a greater architectural ambition than their Saxon predecessors. Almost immediately after their conquest of England the Normans built several fortresses along the River Thames in the centre of the London to consolidate their power, the most notable of which being Baynard's Castle which was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 and the Tower of London which still survives today. The White Tower, the central keep of the Tower of London complex, was completed in the 1080s and built in a Romanesque style. Also of note within The White Tower is the chapel of St John's, one of the oldest and least altered Romanesque churches in all of England. The only other surviving Romanesque church in central London is St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, the remains of a former much larger priory church. Another significant London structure initially constructed by the Normans is Westminster Hall. Completed in 1097 in the reign of William II as a royal residence, the hall become the foundation of the Palace of Westminster, a complex which gradually expanded throughout the Middle Ages. The hall was largely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II and became the largest such hall in medieval Europe. It is notable for its exceptionally wide span hammerbeam roof added in the 14th century, widely considered to be a marvel of medieval engineering. Miraculously Westminster Hall still survives today having escaped the fire of 1834 which destroyed the majority of the medieval Palace of Westminster; it was then incorporated into Barry and Pugin's neo-gothic Palace of Westminster who admired its authentic gothic style. Other surviving examples of medieval halls in London can be found in the form of Guildhall (1440) which once served as London's city hall (it was greatly altered after the great fire) and the Old Hall of Lincoln's Inn (1492). The Normans also began the construction of Old St Paul's Cathedral on Ludgate Hill, replacing a primitive Saxon timber framed building. By the time of its completion in the 14th century the cathedral included elements of Gothic architecture alongside the Romanesque nave constructed by the Normans. The cathedral was one of the largest and tallest churches in medieval Europe; at one point it was crowned by an exceptionally tall spire similar to that of Salisbury Cathedral which was about 158 m (520 ft) high, although this was destroyed after being hit by lightning in the 16th century. The cathedral was latterly completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 and replaced by Christopher Wren's surviving baroque cathedral which retained the medieval cathedral's Latin cross layout. London's other most significant church Westminster Abbey was first constructed in the reign of Edward the Confessor in the romanesque style but was subsequently rebuilt in the gothic style in the 13th century in the reign of Henry III; this produced the building which largely survives today. The sophisticated gothic architecture of the abbey is reminiscent of French Cathedrals like that of Reims rather than the English Gothic of the period, leading to much speculation as to whether the master mason was French. The most significant later addition to the abbey was the Henry VII Chapel built in the late 15th to early 16th century, an exceptional example of late English Gothic architecture notable for its highly ornate fan vaulted ceiling. The twin-towered west front of the abbey was added in the 18th century to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor in a faithful Neo-Gothic style intended to be in keeping with the rest of the medieval building. Other significant gothic churches surviving from the Middle Ages include Southwark Cathedral, a former priory that was the first gothic church in London built between 1220 and 1420, as well as a handful of city churches that miraculously survived the great fire like St Andrew Undershaft, St Helen's Bishopsgate, St Olave's Hart Street and St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. = Tudor Architecture = Hampton Court Palace (1515‚Äì1540) residence of Cardinal Wolsey then Henry VIII,The Tudor period was a period of rapid expansion for London, both economically as a result of growing overseas trade and in terms of population which grew dramatically from roughly 50,000 in 1500 to 250,000 in 1600. As a result of this population boom the city sprawled considerably and by the end of the 16th century the majority of London's population lived outside the city walls for the first time. Henry VII and Henry VIII also commissioned a substantial number of royal works including the extension and construction of several palaces, these included the massive Whitehall Palace that stretched all the way from Westminster Hall to what is now Trafalgar Square, the extravagant Nonsuch Palace in Greenwich and St James's Palace which still partially survives today. But by far the most substantial remaining Tudor palace in Greater London is Hampton Court Palace, originally built for Cardinal Wolsey and then later becoming a residence of Henry VIII. Greatly extended by Christopher Wren in the late 17th century, the palace still retains most of its original Tudor architecture with its original 16th-century great hall, chapel, astronomical clock and gatehouses; it is often regarded as the finest example of Tudor Architecture in England. Henry VIII also greatly influenced the current form of central London by establishing the hunting grounds of Hyde Park, Green Park and St James's Park giving London its exceptionally green city centre which survives to this day. Staple Inn (late 16th century) London's last surviving Inn of Chancery and a very rare surviving example of Tudor architecture in central London. One of the significant developments of Tudor architecture was the use of red brick, particularly in large houses and palaces. Examples of this can be seen in the form of the Tudor gatehouse of Lambeth Palace (1495) the London residence of The Archbishop of Canterbury, Lincoln's Inn (1521) and St James's Palace (1536). Tudor architecture however is most closely associated with it's distinctive vernacular buildings which were typically timber framed and filled with wattle and daub giving the building a black and white 'checkerboard' appearance. Most commercial and domestic buildings in London before the great fire resembled this from. Only a tiny handful of such buildings survive to this day including Staple Inn; an Inn of Chancery dating back to the Tudor period, 41 Cloth Fair; central London's oldest house started in 1597 and Prince Henry's Room; a timber-framed jettied townhouse built in 1610. Although the vast majority of such structures were destroyed in the Great Fire of London many timber-framed houses did, in fact, survive until as late as the late 19th and early 20th centuries but were demolished to make way for new development. A famous example of this is the demolition of Wych Street in the Edwardian period to make way for Kingsway, a new road built between the Strand and High Holborn.

The early Stuart period ‚Äì the period before the outbreak of the English Civil War ‚Äì is significant in the history of London's architecture as it saw the late arrival of the classical style, a century after the style's initial reemergence in Italy in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The pre-eminent architect in this architectural milestone was Inigo Jones, who was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615. Having travelled around Italy and owning a copy of I quattro libri dell'architettura by Andrea Palladio, Jones was one of the first English architects to be firmly influenced by classical architecture, both of classical antiquity and the revival of the style epitomised by the work of Italian architect Andrea Palladio his strongest influence. His first completed major work in inner London was Banqueting House, Whitehall (1622), an extension to the mostly medieval Palace of Whitehall, with a Palladian portland stone facade and a fine painted ceiling by the famous Flemish painter Rubens. As the first truly classical building in London ‚Äì a then primitive predominantly timber-framed medieval city ‚Äì it is an extremely significant building in the history of London's Architecture, described by Eric de Mare as. \\"an architectural innovation that must have startled Londoners with its sophisticated Palladian Masonry, for its main fa√ßades containing rhythmical rows of tall windows, carved decorations and classical pilasters, all in mathematically, carefully proportioned precision, must have seemed to them like a stage set than a building.\\" St Paul's, Covent Garden (1633) Inigo Jones, London's first classical church and the centre piece of Jones's Covent Garden piazza. Another royal commission Queen's House, Greenwich was completed in 1633 and again shows Jones's purist Palladian style that did not mirror the exuberant Baroque which was then fashionable in mainland Europe. But perhaps Jones' most significant architectural commission was the redevelopment of Covent Garden in West London. In 1630 Jones was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to redevelop the area in the west of the city with fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Between 1630 and 1633 Jones designed and constructed London's first modern square; a classical style piazza lined with colonnaded terraced houses and the Church of St Paul on the Western side; the first church in London built in a classical style notable for its monumental tuscan portico. The piazza became a blueprint for the fashionable squares built across the West End of London in the Georgian era and the Church of St Paul was an architectural blueprint for the baroque city churches built by Wren after the Great Fire of London. The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 greatly interrupted building activity in England and after the parliamentarian victory Jones was heavily fined due to his close connections to Charles I. He later died in poverty in 1652. His London works the Banqueting House, Queen's House, St Paul's Covent Garden and Queen's Chapel all survive to this day. Lindsey House (1640) on Lincolns Inn Fields, a very early Palladian townhouse, is also possibly by Jones. Despite his short architectural career and few surviving works, Jones's introduction of classical architecture to England is one of the great milestones of English architectural history.

Baroque London: The Great Fire and Christopher Wren's Reconstruction (1666‚Äì1714)  alt= The Great Fire of London of 1666 destroyed almost 90% of the largely medieval city, including a total of 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, Old St Paul's Cathedral, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the General Letter Office, and the three western city gates; Ludgate, Newgate, and Aldersgate. Although the Great Fire is considered to be a cataclysmic event in the history of London, the enormous destruction it caused also presented a historic opportunity to completely replan and modernise the somewhat primitive, predominantly medieval city in its subsequent reconstruction. Radical classical style reconstruction plans were quickly drawn up by architects such as Christopher Wren which proposed to completely discard the city's chaotic medieval street plan in favour of a rationalised grid system with wide boulevards, piazzas and a uniform classical style for all new buildings. However, due to a shortage of labour necessary to complete such grandiose plans, complications with redistributing and compensating property that had been lost in the fire, as well as the intense urgency of rebuilding the city as quickly as possible, it was thus decided to rebuild the city around the original medieval street plan. Despite the rejection of a classical style replanning of the city, London nonetheless witnessed a radical architectural transformation in its subsequent reconstruction. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the new city compared to its predecessor was its architectural uniformity. In 1667 Charles II specified that all new houses were to be built to a uniform height and plot size, as well all being built of brick rather than wood to reduce fire hazard. As a result, the chaotic streets of overhanging timber-framed houses of medieval and Stuart London were replaced with neat rows of uniformly proportioned brick terraces. A good surviving example of the kind of simple brick terraces built immediately after the fire can be found at King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple, becoming a blue print for the Georgian terraced house. = St Paul's Cathedral and The City Churches = But undoubtedly the most striking architectural achievement of the new city was the reconstruction of St Paul's Cathedral and the City Churches by Christopher Wren, the preeminent architect of the English Baroque movement. Much like his masterplan for the reconstruction of the city, Wren's original design for the new St Paul's Cathedral was also rejected and a compromise design had to be reached as a result. Inspired by St Peter's Basillica in Rome, Wren originally wanted to build a domed baroque style cathedral built in a Greek cross layout, but this design was rejected by the church as a result of the excessive papist connotations of this very Southern European design. In an act of compromise, the design that was eventually built is a hybrid design which utilises baroque ornamentation and a great dome but built on the Latin cross layout of the former gothic cathedral. Largely as a result of the awkward incorporation of a Latin cross layout in a baroque design, the overall composition of the cathedral is considered to be inferior to most comparable baroque cathedrals of the same period, however, the 111-metre-high dome completed in 1710 is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever built, and has since become one of London's most enduring landmarks; it was also London's tallest building from 1710 until 1962. The main west facade with its double corinthian order and fine baroque towers is another successful feature of the exterior, with a great imposing scale when viewed up Ludgate Hill. The tower of St Mary-le-Bow (1683) Christopher Wren, one of the finest of the City Churches. The 51 city churches (25 of which survive today) designed by Wren and his team are also of great architectural significance. Stylistically they are very eclectic and inventive designs, that were often built on very small and limiting sites. The towers of the churches are the most architecturally notable and inventive feature of the church exteriors. Perhaps the most notable examples are the unusual tiered spire of St Bride's Fleet Street the tallest of the city churches and the famous tower of St-Mary-le-bow, an inventive mixture of classicism and gothic. Stylistically most of the churches are not purely baroque in their style, the most notable exception being St Stephen's Walbrook with its fine domed interior. Many of the churches such as St Peter Upon Cornhill showcase a strong influence from Dutch classicism and Palladianism, whereas others like St Mary Aldermary are purely neo-gothic recreations of the former medieval churches, complete with a fan vaulted ceiling harking back to the perpendicular gothic of the late Middle Ages. Despite the architectural merit of these individual buildings, perhaps the most significant achievement of Wren's reconstruction of St Paul's and the city churches was their overall interaction as an ensemble. Observing Canaletto's views of the City of London painted in 1750, one can see how St Paul's and the City Churches soar prominently above the rest of the city as a result of the tightly restricted height of all new domestic and commercial buildings in the city. The result is a highly picturesque skyline whose beauty astounded visitors to the newly reconstructed city. And so paradoxically, the great catastrophe that was the Great Fire of London can be considered in hindsight to have given a great new lease of life to London, as it gave a much-needed opportunity drastically improve and modernise the city. In the words of the architectural historian Dr Simon Thurley: \\"This apparent catastrophe [...] was in reality one of the best things that ever happened to London. [...] The Great Fire of London enabled a new start - a new type of mass housing, handsome paved streets populated with modern churches and public buildings. There was a new Royal Exchange, a new Cathedral, a rebuilt Guildhall. London now was cleaner, more modern and more uniform that any other city in Europe [...] and it remained so until the mid 19th century.\\" = Later Architectural Commissions: Royal Hospital Chelsea, Old Royal Naval College and The Commissioners Churches = Christ Church, Spitalfields (1729) showcasing the unusual style of Nicholas Hawksmoor But the reconstruction of London was not the only significant architectural commission of this period. Christopher Wren, very much the preeminent architect of this period, was tasked with the design of two new military hospitals; the first being the Royal Hospital Chelsea for army veterans completed in 1692, and the latter of which being the Greenwich Hospital (latterly known as the Old Royal Naval College) completed in 1712. Royal Chelsea Hospital is one of Wren's more restrained works, with its red brick facades resembling long residential terraces. It nonetheless has a fine chapel and great hall with decorative interiors. In contrast Old Royal Naval College with its ornate Painted Hall, St Paul's Chapel and symmetrical east and west wings that frame Queens House by Inigo Jones is widely considered to be the crowning glory of the English Baroque movement. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the site is described as \\"the finest and most dramatically sited architectural ensemble and landscape ensemble in the British Isles.\\" Other fine examples of English Baroque in London can be found in the form of the Commissioner's Churches, 12 highly original churches that were built in response to a 1710 act of Parliament requesting the building of 50 new churches in London (the further 38 were not completed). The majority of these churches were designed by Wren's former assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor who made significant contributions to the design of the City Churches and Old Royal Naval College. Hawksmoor is well known for his highly eccentric and idiosyncratic style that draws upon influences in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and even medieval architecture. Perhaps the most lauded and best known of these churches is Christ Church, Spitalfields (1729) which showcases Hawksmoor's trademark blend of baroque and gothic, as well his tendency to create buildings with an imposing sense of monumentality. Other Commissioner's Churches such as St Mary-le-Strand by James Gibbs and St John's Smith Square by Thomas Archer are also superlative examples of late English Baroque Architecture showing a much stronger European influence than the designs of Wren or Hawksmoor whilst still maintaining a distinctly English sensibility.

Bedford Square was one of many squares built in the west of London as the city expanded greatly beyond it's historical boundaries. The Georgian era (1714‚Äì1830) was one of great economic and colonial expansion, seeing Britain emerge as a global trading power with London as its epicentre. This great rise in prestige and wealth is reflected in London's significant growth in size and population in the 18th century. The city sprawled significantly, with substantial new development in areas in the west of the city such as Bloomsbury, Marylebone, Mayfair and Kensington, as well as in London's Satellite villages like Hampstead, Islington, Hackney and Dulwich. This development was centred around the construction of terraces and fashionable new squares like Grosvenor Square, Portman Square and Bedford Square, which became the new home of the burgeoning middle classes that emerged from Britain's new mercantile economy. As well as this, with the construction of new bridges across the Thames at Westminster (1750) and Blackfriars (1769), the first new bridges since the early Middle Ages, the city began to spread significantly south of river. The style colloquially known as 'Georgian' refers to the British interpretation of 18th-century neoclassical architecture, with stylistic routes that lay firmly in Palladian architecture, particularly in the writings of Scottish architect Colen Campell. Often described as the 'father of the Georgian style', Campell's highly influential book Vitruvius Britannicus set the stylistic tone for English architecture for the rest of the 18th century. This more restrained style was a reaction against the exuberant Baroque of the late 17th century, with a strict emphasis on plain unadorned brickwork, geometrical harmony and restrained classically inspired ornament. Despite this reactionary motive, Georgian architects nonetheless took great influence from Christopher Wren and other English Baroque architects. A precursor to the more unobtrusive Georgian style can be seen in the simple plain terraces built after the Great Fire of London at 4 King's Bench Walk in Temple or the plain brick facades of Royal Chelsea Hospital, both by Wren. Key architects of the Georgian period who built substantial works in London include James Gibbs, Robert Adam, William Kent and William Chambers. = The Georgian Terraced House = The front door of 10 Downing Street (1734), a classic example of a Georgian porch. Residential houses of this era in London are distinctive for their sunken basement built on brick arch foundations, rusticated base storey, taller piano nobile reception floor and attic storey. They are generally built from buff (pale yellow) London Stock Brick to golden section proportions, often generously spanning triple bay frontages with 'implied' columns or pilasters and carefully proportioned and very large off-white sash windows, slate mansard roofs above an Attic pediment. They were grouped in formal garden squares, crescents and terraces with wide pavements supported on brick vaults on wide, straight public streets, often with private access to romantically landscaped gardens. Later encroachment of commercial properties has significantly reduced the apparent width of historic streets in many parts of London, where the original plans were comparable to in size or in excess of those found in Continental urban planning. The area of Spitalfields in East London has many extant early Georgian properties with some unusual continental features; Soho ‚Äì particularly Meard Street and Westminster also preserve a large number of properties at an early stage of development of the style.Spencer House (1756) John Vardy, the grandest surviving aristocratic townhouse from the Georgian period. A typical house was designed to accommodate a single family, with front and back rooms on each floor and a partial-width rear 'closet' wing projection. The ground floor was reserved for business, the tall piano nobile for formal entertaining, and upper storeys with family bedrooms all accessed from a stair positioned on the side party. Servants were accommodated in the below-ground kitchen and in attic rooms in the roof. Each of the distinctions in function was subtly indicated in the decorative scheme of the fa√ßade by the sequential height of openings, projecting cornices and restrained decorative mouldings such as round-headed arches and rustication at the base and diminishing columns, sculptural capitals, balustrades and friezes expressing the top.St Martin-in-the-Fields (1726) by James Gibbs Features include: * A tall panelled front door with an arched fanlight often flanked by columns and covered by a pedimented canopy is reached up a short walkway which extends from the street, arching over the basement cavity and protected from burglary by a run of wrought iron security railings. * Sash windows which allow the window to be held open on corded lead weights to ventilate the room. Developed in Holland and first seen in the Royal Palaces, they became common in Georgian times; previously casement windows had been the norm. The sash box joinery and ovolo or astragal moulded window frames were designed to be as slim and unobtrusive as achievable, using the largest available sheets of glass in either a \\"6 over 6\\" or \\"6 over 9\\" pattern. Since the 1980s, these are often now painted in brilliant white; however this modern colour did not exist in the period: originally they were painted ivory off-white, pale yellow or other darker colours of the period. * Window openings in the proportion of 1:2 or the golden section; the windows were headed by the Dutch style flat arch often made from gauged brickwork in the finest properties. * The roof is often hidden by a parapet above an attic frieze. This was initially to reduce the spread of fire; however, in much of London, parapets were added to Georgian houses for aesthetic reasons alone. From the street, the building appears to have a flat roof, but from the rear one can see that there is a double pitched 'butterfly' roof. *Elevational classical adornments such as rustication, pilasters, columns, medallions, friezes, cornices and false pediments often formed in timber, stucco or natural stone are obvious indicators of wealth and status; however, much care and restraint was exercised to avoid the excessive flamboyance of continental architecture, with a marked preference for severe simplicity, honesty of means and sparseness of ornament in line with Protestant and neo-Palladian thinking, best exemplified by the work of Scottish Enlightenment architect Robert Adams ‚Äì a philosophy extended to interior furnishing by the Thomas Chippendale furniture. * Suburban buildings are usually constructed from London stock brick, in a yellowish buff colour (which often appears grey ‚Äì see 10 Downing Street). More prestigious houses are rendered with stucco or built from imported natural stone. *Chimney breasts were located in shared party walls, with gable parapets projecting above the roof line. The great number of chimney pots on London properties indicates the relative wealth of the inhabitants, serving fireplaces in every room.The Western facade of Somerset House (1776) William Chambers = The Georgian Townhouse = But Georgian houses in London did not just come in the form of simple terraces. Many much more sumptuous homes known as townhouses were built as city residences for the nobility and gentry as opposed to their country house or stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were stand-alone buildings like Spencer House but some were terraced buildings such as Chandos House. In the Georgian period many of these grand houses once lined Piccadilly and Park Lane but the majority of these were demolished as they went out of fashion in the late 19th and early 20th century, including the famous Devonshire House on Piccadilly. The few that do survive to this day include Spencer House, Burlington House, Apsley House, Chandos House, Cambridge House, Melbourne House, Marlborough House and Lancaster House. As well as this in the Greater London area a number of fine stately homes from the Georgian period can be found. These include the Palladian villa Chiswick House with its famous landscape gardens by William Kent and Syon House with its lavish interiors by Robert Adam. = Georgian Church and Civic Architecture = An array of notable civic, commercial and religious structures were also built in the Georgian period. Churches of the Georgian period were still very heavily influenced by the work of Sir Christopher Wren who had pioneered the use of classical architecture in church design in England with his City Churches. But with the declining popularity of the Baroque style, Georgian church design took a more restrained Palladian approach than Wren. Arguably the most famous church of the period is St Martin-in-the-Fields (1722) by James Gibbs. Often described as the archetypal church of the Georgian period, St Martin-in-the-Fields is a simple neoclassical 'temple church' with restrained Palladian ornament on its exterior and a tall spire that evokes memories of Wren's City Churches. Its format was much copied across England and abroad. St Peter, Vere Street (1722) also by James Gibbs is a further indicator of the increasing simplicity of church design in the 18th century. Palladianism also dominated civic architecture in the Georgian period in London. This is exemplified by William Kent's Horse Guards on Whitehall (1750), an essay in the austere Palladian style of mid-18th century. Arguably the most significant secular architectural commission of Georgian London was Somerset House, a collection of government offices on the Strand that was to replace a 16th-century house of the same name on the site. The resulting building was designed by William Chambers and completed in 1776. The building is built in a quadrangle with a grand courtyard in the centre. On the south side of the exterior there is a grand terrace overlooking the River Thames and at ground level a watergate that would have once faced directly onto the River Thames before the construction of the Victoria Embankment. New bridges across the River Thames were also built in the Georgian period; the first bridges built in London since the early Middle Ages. These bridges included Westminster Bridge in 1750, Blackfriars Bridge in 1769 and Richmond Bridge in 1777; all were built in a neoclassical style. With the exception of Richmond Bridge, all of these bridges have now been replaced. These bridges were highly significant as London Bridge had been the only bridge across the river for over 500 years. Their construction greatly encouraged development south of the river.

London has some of the finest examples from the late-Georgian phase of British architecture known as Regency. This is aesthetically distinct from early Georgian architecture, though it falls within the scope of Georgian architecture and continues the stylistic trend of Neoclassicism. Technically the Regency era only lasted between 1811 and 1820, when the Prince Regent ruled as proxy for his incapacitated father George III, but the distinctive trends in art and architecture in fashion during the Regency extended roughly into the first 40 years of the 19th century. Regency is above all a very stringent form of Classicism, directly referencing Graeco-Roman architecture and structures. Regency employed enhanced ornamentation like friezes with high and low relief figural or vegetative motifs, statuary, urns, and porticos, all the while keeping the clean lines and symmetry of early Georgian architecture. Typically Georgian features like sash windows were retained, along with first- floor balconies, which became especially popular in the Regency period, with either delicate cast iron scrollwork or traditional balusters.Athenaeum Club (1830) by Decimus Burton, a grand neoclassical clubhouse on Pall Mall. The most noticeable difference between early Georgian and Regency architecture is the covering of previously exposed brick fa√ßades with stucco painted in cream tones to imitate marble or natural stone. John Nash was the leading proponent of Regency Classicism, and some of his finest works survive in London. These include the grand residential terraces surrounding Regent's Park: Cumberland Terrace, Cambridge Terrace, Park Square, and Park Crescent. Nash's heavy use of stucco on these buildings was often deceptive as much as it was aesthetic: stucco served to obscure inferior-quality construction caused by hurried building and cost-cutting measures because Nash had a financial interest in the Regent's Park developments. The designs for the other Regent's Park terraces (Cornwall, Clarence and York) were entrusted to Decimus Burton, an architect who specialised in Greek Revival. These imposing terraces employ all the signature features of Regency Classicism: imposing, temple-like frontages covered in gleaming stucco with projecting porches, porticos with Corinthian or Ionic capitals, large pediments, and figural friezes extending along the upper part of the fa√ßades. Burton's design for the Athenaeum Club (1830) on Pall Mall, whose sculptural frieze was modelled on the recently acquired Elgin Marbles in the British Museum, is another splendid example of Regency Classicism. Only steps away from the Athenaeum, Nash designed what has been called \\"London's finest Regency terrace\\", Carlton House Terrace (1829), on the site of the Prince Regent's demolished Carlton House. Carlton House was demolished in 1826 after the new King, George IV, moved to Buckingham Palace, and Nash was employed to design the three-house terrace in his signature, rigidly Classical style: clad in stucco, with an imposing Corinthian portico, balconies, pediments, and Attic parapet, over a podium with squat Doric columns. The British Museum (1827) by the prolific Regency architect Robert Smirke. The faithful usage of the ionic order in the building's facade epitomises the purist Greek Revival style that became fashionable in the late Regency Period. It was significantly extended in the Edwardian period. Nash's most defining association was with the Prince Regent, who was his greatest patron. The most enduring legacy of this relationship is Buckingham Palace, which was transformed from the modest Buckingham House of George III's reign into a grand Neoclassical palace to Nash's designs. Beginning in 1825, Nash extended the existing house westwards and added two flanking wings, which created an open forecourt, or Cour d'honneur, facing St. James's Park. The style is remarkably similar to Nash's terraces on the edges of Regents Park, except that the Palace was built in golden-hued Bath stone instead of stucco- faced brick. The front fa√ßade of the main block features a two-storey porch of Doric columns on the bottom, tall fluted Corinthian columns above, with a pediment topped by statuary and adorned in high-relief sculpture. All the hallmarks of Regency Neoclassicism also appear, including an encompassing frieze with vegetative scrollwork made of Coade stone, balconies accessible from the first floor, and an attic with figural sculptures using the Elgin Marbles as their model. The west front overlooking the main garden features a bay window at its centre, with a long terrace with balustrades and large Classical urns made of Coade stone. Preceding the forecourt was a monumental Roman arch, modelled on the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris, which currently stands as the Marble Arch at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park. The addition of the East Wing early in the reign of Queen Victoria enclosed the forecourt and created the frontage of Buckingham Palace known ever since, but the bulk of the Palace exterior remains from Nash's Regency additions, particularly the long garden front on the west side. Contemporaneous to Nash's building work in Regent's Park and St. James', the development of Belgravia further west offers the most uniform and extensive example of Regency architecture in London in the form of Belgrave Square, Eaton Square, Wilton Crescent and Chester Square. An ultra-exclusive housing development built on a formerly rural swathe of land on the Grosvenor Estate, building was entrusted to Thomas Cubitt and began in 1825 with Belgrave Square; the three main squares were completed and occupied by the 1840s. Like Nash, Cubitt designed elegant Classical terraces,. All were covered in white-painted stucco, with the entrance to each house featuring projecting Doric porches supporting first floor balconies with tall pedimented windows, and attics resting on cornice- work in the Greek manner. Holy Trinity, Marylebone (1827) John Soane, a fine example of a 'Waterloo Church' and a rare extant work by Soane, famed for his now demolished Bank of England. The Regency period also saw the construction of some of London's finest neoclassical churches, many of which were Commissioner's Churches. A Commissioners' church, also known as a Waterloo church and Million Act church, is an Anglican church built with money voted by Parliament as a result of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The First Parliamentary Grant for churches amounted to ¬£1 million (equivalent to ¬£73,550,000 in 2019), which is why the 1818 Act that provided for it is sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the Million Pound Act. The Second Parliamentary Grant of 1824 amounted to an additional ¬£500,000 (¬£44,320,000 in 2019), so the term \\"million\\" cannot apply to all the churches aided by the Commission. The Commission was founded on a wave of national triumph following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815; hence the suggestion of the word \\"Waterloo\\" in the title. Commissioner's churches in London include All Souls, Langham Place by John Nash; the church's unusual circular tower was deliberately placed on a bend on Nash's Regents Street to create a picturesque view from Oxford Circus, the fine neoclassical St Mary's, Bryanston Square by Robert Smirke and St Luke's, Chelsea one of London's first Gothic-revival churches; an indication of the shift of a style away from neoclassicism that was to occur later in the 19th century. Other fine Regency churches include St Pancras New Church (1822) by William and Henry Inwood, possibly the most authentic Greek-revival church in London complete with a replica of the 'porch of the maidens' from the Erechtheion temple in Athens and St Marylebone Parish Church (1819) by Thomas Hardwick with its distinctive tower crowned with gilded angels.

Victorian architecture (1837‚àí1901) Palace of Westminster (1840-1876) Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Pugin, arguably the most iconic building of the Victorian age. The Midland Grand Hotel, adjoining St Pancras Railway Station (1868), one of the greatest examples of Gothic Revival Architecture in London. Buildings from the Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) and their diverse range of forms and ornamentation are the single largest group from any architectural period in London. The Victorian era saw unprecedented urbanisation and growth in London, coinciding with Britain's ascendancy in the world economy and London's global pre- eminence as the first metropolis of the modern world. As the political centre of the world's largest Empire and the trading and financial hub of the Pax Britannica, London's architecture reflects the extraordinary affluence of the period. As London grew during the 19th century, the former compact, close proximity of different social classes in the City of London transformed into a taste for specially developed suburbs for specific classes of the population. This is reflected in the style of domestic and commercial architecture. Donald Olsen wrote in The Growth of Victorian London that \\"the shift from multi- purpose to single-purpose neighborhoods reflected the pervasive move towards professionalization and specialization in all aspects of nineteenth-century thought and activity.\\" The single most pervasive style of architecture was Neo-Gothic, also called Gothic Revival, embodied by the new Palace of Westminster built to designs by Charles Barry between 1840 and 1876. Gothic architecture embodied \\"the influence of London's past\\" and coincided with Romanticism, a cultural movement which glorified all things medieval, from literature and painting to music and architecture. The evangelism prevalent in mid-century Britain was also a factor in favouring Gothic Revival, which referenced great English cathedrals like Ely and Salisbury. New churches were constructed to exuberant and ornate Gothic Revival designs to imitate the great cathedrals of the past. The finest of these include All Saints church in Fitzrovia, the French-Gothic St Augustine's, Kilburn designed by John Loughborough Pearson (founded 1870), St Mary Magdalene, Paddington, and St Cuthbert's, Earls Court, designed by Hugh Roumieu Gough and built between 1884 and 1887. St. Cuthbert's, according to English Heritage, has \\"one of the most lavish and consistent [interior] schemes in any Victorian church\\" and is \\"one of the richest ecclesiastical interiors in London.\\" Modelled in its proportions after Tintern Abbey, and packed with splendid decoration of marble, stone, wrought iron, and oak, the masterpiece of St. Cuthbert's is the 50-foot high wooden reredos carved in an elaborate late-Gothic Spanish style. The leading proponents of Gothic Revival were Augustus Pugin, entrusted with the interior design of the Palace of Westminster, and John Ruskin, a highly influential art critic. Hallmarks of Gothic architecture are tracery, a form of delicate, web-like ornamentation for windows, parapets, and all external ornamentation. Symmetry of lines, pointed arches, spires, and steep roofs are other characteristics. Cast iron, and from the mid-19th century mild steel, were used in Gothic revival iron structures like Blackfriars Bridge (1869) and St. Pancras railway station (1868). Other significant buildings built in Gothic Revival are the Royal Courts of Justice (1882), the Midland Grand Hotel (1876) adjoining St. Pancras Station, Liverpool Street station (1875), and the Albert Memorial (1872) in Kensington Gardens. Even the suburbs were built in derivative Gothic Revival styles, called \\"Wimbledon Gothic\\". The Royal Albert Hall (1871) an Italianate concert hall which is the centre piece of 'Albertopolis' in Kensington. Royal Courts of Justice (1882) George Edmund Street, one of the last great flowerings of Victorian High Gothic. Iron was not just decorative, but advancements in engineering enabled its use to build the first iron-framed structures in history. Iron beams afforded unprecedented span and height in new buildings, with the added advantage of being fireproof. The greatest embodiment of iron's possibilities was found in Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace, a 990,000-square-foot (9.2 hectare) exhibition hall made of cast iron and plate glass, which opened in 1851. Before that, iron was already being used to gird the roofs of the King's Library in the British Museum, built between 1823 and 1827, the Reform Club (1837‚Äì1841), Travellers Club (1832), and the new Palace of Westminster. The technological advancements pioneered with the Crystal Palace would be applied to the building of London's great railway termini in the latter half of the century: St. Pancras, Liverpool Street, Paddington, King's Cross, and Victoria. King's Cross was a relative latecomer; built in 1851 to support incoming traffic for the Crystal Palace exhibition, its arched glass terminal sheds (each 71 ft. (22 m) wide) were reinforced with laminated wooden ribs which were replaced in the 1870s with cast iron. London Paddington had already set the model for train stations built with iron support piers and framework, when it was completed in 1854 to the designs of the greatest of Victorian engineers, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Victorian architecture was not confined to Gothic Revival but was diverse, using a great variety of historic styles. These included Renaissance Revival, Queen Anne Revival (popular in the late 19th century), Moorish Revival, and Neoclassicism. New styles, not based on revivals of historic architecture, were also avidly adopted, like that of the Second Empire copied from France in the 1870s. From the 1860s, terracotta began to be used as a decorative appliqu√© for new constructions, but it was most popular between 1880 and 1900. During this period, entire buildings were covered in elaborately moulded terracotta tiles, like the Natural History Museum (1880), the rebuilt Harrods department store (1895‚Äì1905), and the Prudential Assurance Building at Holborn Bars (1885‚Äì1901). Terracotta was very advantageous in that it was colourful and, because it was kiln-fired, it did not absorb the heavy air pollution of Victorian London, unlike brick and stone. As Ben Weinreb described terracotta's usage: \\"it found the greatest favour on the brasher, self- advertising types of building such as shops, theatres, pubs and the larger City offices.\\" Despite the explosive growth of Victorian London and the impressive scale of much of the building that had taken place, by the 1880s and 1890s there was an increasing belief that London's urban fabric was inferior to other European cities and unsuitable for the capital of the world's largest empire. There was little coherent urban planning in London during the Victorian era, apart from major infrastructure projects like the Thames Embankment and Tower Bridge. Critics compared London to cities like Paris and Vienna, where state intervention and large scale demolition had created a more regular arrangement, with broad boulevards, panoramas and architectural uniformity. London was \\"visibly the bastion of private property rights\\", which accounted for the eclecticism of its buildings.

Edwardian Architecture (1901‚Äì1914) The Old Bailey (1902) is a notable example of the Edwardian Baroque revival that was heavily influenced by the work of Christopher Wren. The dawn of the 20th century and the death of Queen Victoria (1901) saw a shift in architectural taste and a reaction against Victorianism. The popularity of Neoclassicism, dormant during the latter half of the 19th century, revived with the new styles of Beaux-Arts and Edwardian Baroque, also called the \\"Grand Manner\\" or \\"Wrenaissance\\", for the influence that Wren's work had on this movement. Neoclassical architecture suited an \\"Imperial City\\" like London because it evoked the grandeur of the Roman Empire and was monumental in scale. Trademarks include rusticated stonework, banded columns or quoins of alternating smooth and rusticated stonework, exaggerated voussoirs for arched openings, free-standing columns or semi-engaged pilasters with either Corinthian or Ionic capitals, and domed roofs with accompanying corner domes or elaborate cupolas. In adopting such styles, British architects evoked hallowed English Baroque structures like St. Paul's Cathedral and Inigo Jones' Banqueting House. Municipal, government, and ecclesiastical buildings of the years 1900‚Äì1914 avidly adopted Neo-Baroque architecture for large construction works like the Old Bailey (1902), County Hall (begun in 1911), the Port of London Authority building (begun 1912), the War Office (1906), and Methodist Central Hall (1911). The most impressive commercial buildings constructed during the Edwardian era include the famous Ritz Hotel on Piccadilly (1906), Norman Shaw's Piccadilly Hotel (1905), Selfridges department store (1909), and Whiteleys department store (1911). All of these were built in variations of Neoclassicism: Beaux-Arts, Neo-Baroque, or Louis XVI. The firm of Mew√®s & Davis, partners who were alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, specialised in 18th century French architecture, specifically Louis XVI. This is evident in their two most famous projects, the Ritz Hotel and Inveresk House, the headquarters of the Morning Post, on Aldwych. Selfridges, Oxford Street (1909) is a rare example of the French Beaux-Arts movement in London. The popularity of terracotta for exterior cladding waned in favour of glazed ceramic tiles known as glazed architectural terracotta (often called \\"faience\\" at the time). Outstanding examples include the Strand Palace Hotel (1909) and Regent Palace Hotel (1914), both clad in cream- coloured 'Marmo' tiles manufactured by Burmantofts Pottery; Michelin House (1911); and Debenham House (1907). London Underground stations built during the Edwardian years, namely those on the Piccadilly Line and Bakerloo Line, all employ glazed tile cladding designed by Leslie Green. The signature features of these stations are glazed oxblood red tiles for the station exteriors, ticket halls clad in green and white tiles, and platforms decorated in individual colour themes varying between stations. Glazed tiles had the added advantages of being easy to clean and impervious to London's polluted atmosphere. Harrods (1905), a grand Edwardian department store with a terracotta facade. The two most important architectural accomplishments in London during the Edwardian years were the building of Kingsway and the creation of an enormous processional route stretching from Buckingham Palace to St. Paul's Cathedral. A grand parade route for state pageantry, a common feature of European cities, was felt to be sadly lacking in London. To accomplish this a group of buildings standing between The Mall and Trafalgar Square were demolished and replaced with the grand Neo-Baroque edifice of Admiralty Arch. This created one grand east‚Äìwest parade route encompassing Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square via Admiralty Arch, then connecting with the newly widened Strand, and thence to Fleet Street. The 82 ft (25 m) high Victoria Memorial was erected in front of Buckingham Palace (unveiled in 1911) and encircled by four ceremonial gates dedicated to the British dominions: Canada Gate, Australia Gate, South and West Africa Gates. In 1913 the decaying Caen stone on the fa√ßade of Buckingham Palace, blackened by pollution and deteriorating, was replaced with a more impressive facing of Portland stone. Russell Square Tube Station (1906) by Leslie Green. All such stations are now Grade II listed. Kingsway, a 100-foot (30 m) wide boulevard with underground tram tunnel stretching north‚Äìsouth from the Strand to High Holborn, was the culmination of a slum clearance and urban regeneration project initiated by the Strand Improvement Bill of 1899. This involved the clearance of a notorious Holborn slum known as Clare Market, between Covent Garden and Lincoln's Inn Fields. The demolition destroyed buildings dating back to the Elizabethan era, some of the few to have survived the Great Fire of London. In its place Kingsway and Aldwych were constructed, the latter a crescent-shaped road connecting the Strand to Kingsway. The north side of the Strand was demolished, allowing the street to be widened and more impressive and architecturally sound buildings to be constructed. Lining these grand new boulevards were impressive new theatres, hotels, and diplomatic commissions in imposing Neoclassical, Portland stone-clad designs. These new buildings included the headquarters of Britain's most important imperial possessions: India House, Australia House, with South Africa House built in the 1930s opposite Trafalgar Square. There were plans to demolish two churches along the Strand, St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes, the latter designed by Sir Christopher Wren, because they were protruding into the street and causing traffic congestion. After public outcry the Strand was instead widened to go round these churches, creating 'islands' in the middle. =Steel= In the first decade of the 20th century, the use of steel to reinforce new buildings advanced tremendously. Steel piers had been used in isolation to support the National Liberal Club (1886) and the rebuilt Harrods department store (1905). The extension of 1904‚Äì05 to the Savoy Hotel used steel framing for the whole construction, followed closely by the Ritz Hotel (1906); the latter gained popular reputation as the first building in London to be steel-framed. The abundance of domes in the Edwardian period is also attributable to steel girders, which made large domes lighter, cheaper to build, and much easier to engineer. Selfridges on Oxford Street, modelled after American-style department stores, was the true watershed, because its size was unprecedented by British standards and far exceeded existing building regulations. To gain planning approval, Selfridge's architect Sven Bylander (the engineer responsible for the Ritz) worked closely with the London County Council (LCC) to update the LCC's woefully outdated regulations on the use of steel, dating back to 1844. In 1907 he gained approval for his plans, and by 1909, when Selfridges opened, the LCC passed the LCC (General Powers) Act, also known as the Steel Act, which provided comprehensive guidelines for steel-framed buildings and a more streamlined process for gaining planning permission. By this point, steel reinforcement was de rigueur in any sizable public or commercial building, as seen in the new buildings proliferating along Aldwych and Kingsway.

After the end of World War I, several outstanding building projects begun before 1914 were finally completed. The sombre mood and straitened financial circumstances of interwar Britain made the flamboyant Neo-Baroque style no longer suitable for new architecture. Instead, British architects turned back to the austere, clean lines of Georgian Architecture for inspiration. Consequently, Neo-Georgian was the preferred style for municipal and government architecture well into the 1960s. The sale and demolition of many of London's grandest aristocratic houses gave rise to some of the largest private building projects of the interwar period, built to Art Deco or Neo-Georgian designs. These include The Dorchester (Art Deco) and the Grosvenor House Hotel (Neo-Georgian) on Park Lane, both on the sites of grand London houses of the same names. Many buildings clustered around Georgian squares in central London were demolished and replaced, ironically enough, with Neo-Georgian edifices in near-identical styles but larger. Grosvenor Square, the most exclusive of London's squares, saw the demolition of original Georgian buildings in favour of the uniform Neo-Georgian townhouses which currently surround the square on the north, east and south sides. In St James's Square several buildings were demolished and rebuilt in the Neo- Georgian style, the most famous of which was Norfolk House. Daily Express Building (1932) was one of the first glass curtain wall buildings in London. Neo-Classical architecture remained popular for large building projects in London, but it dispensed with the heavy ornamentation and bold proportions of the Baroque. It remained the preferred style for banks, financial houses, and associations seeking to communicate prestige and authority. Perhaps the most prominent example of interwar Neoclassicism is the rebuilt Bank of England in the City of London, designed by Sir Herbert Baker and built between 1921 and 1937. The most influential proponent of Neoclassicism in interwar Britain was Sir Edwin Lutyens. His distinctive form of Neoclassicism can be seen in London with the Cenotaph, the monolithic, streamlined war memorial built of Portland stone on Whitehall; the Midland Bank building; and Britannic House in Finsbury Circus, both in the City of London, and the headquarters of the British Medical Association in Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury. In Westminster, a fine example of interwar Neoclassicism is Devonshire House, an office building constructed between 1924 and 1926 on the site of the former London house of the Dukes of Devonshire. Classicism of this style was almost exclusively executed in the ever-popular Portland stone. =Art Deco= Existing alongside the more prevalent Neo-Georgian and Neoclassical forms of architecture used in the capital in the 1920s and 1930s, Art Deco was nonetheless an extremely popular style from about 1925 to the later 1930s. The true stimulus was the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, where Art Deco had been developed roughly 20 years earlier. London, alongside New York City and Paris, became an innovative and experimental ground for Art Deco architecture. This is defined by clean lines, curves, geometric patterns, bold colour, and elaborate, stylised sculptural accents. Art Deco was adopted most enthusiastically by \\"modern\\" businesses and those seeking to advertise their modernity and forward-thinking attitude. These included cinemas, media headquarters, airports, swimming pools, factories, and power stations (such as Battersea Power Station). It was a flashy, luxurious style, so it was also well adapted for department stores (e.g. Simpsons of Piccadilly), theatres, hotels, and blocks of flats.The Hoover Building (1931), a famous example of London Art Deco showcasing a more stereotypical American take on the style. Two of London's finest examples of Art Deco architecture stand on Fleet Street: the Daily Telegraph building (1928) and the Daily Express building. The fa√ßade of the latter is, unusually for the time, composed entirely of glass, vitrolite and chromium, which stood out boldly amongst the stone and brick architecture of Fleet Street. The use of industrial, sleek materials like these was more common in Deco buildings in New York City than it was in London: Portland stone remained overwhelmingly the material of choice. For example, another media headquarters, the BBC's Broadcasting House on Portland Place, was built in the traditional Portland stone with outstanding figural sculptures by Eric Gill. Ideal House (1929), is highly unusual in combining Art Deco with Egyptian motifs, on a fa√ßade clad in shiny black granite. Another Art Deco/Egyptian synthesis is the Carreras Cigarette Factory in Mornington Crescent. The erection of ultra-modern Deco buildings often came at the expense of older architectural gems, some irreplaceable. Along the Embankment two large Deco buildings were constructed which continue to dominate London's riverfront profile. The elegant Neoclassical Adelphi Buildings, designed by Robert and John Adam and built between 1768 and 1771, were demolished to build the New Adelphi office building in the 1930s. Adjacent to the Adelphi, the grand Hotel Cecil (1896) was demolished to make way for Shell Mex House (1931), a 190 ft (58 m) high Art Deco office building which features London's largest clock. The 19-storey Senate House, headquarters of the University of London, is the tallest Art Deco structure in London and was one of the tallest buildings in London when finished in 1937. It elicited, and continues to elicit, much criticism because it stands so tall and obtrusive amongst the modest Georgian squares of Bloomsbury. Evelyn Waugh described it as a \\"vast bulk...insulting the autumnal sky\\", while more recent critics have called it Stalinesque or reminiscent of the Third Reich. This association with totalitarian architecture was reinforced by the wartime rumour that Hitler wanted the Senate House for his London headquarters upon conquering Britain, and therefore ordered Luftwaffe bombers to avoid it during The Blitz.

In the Blitz, London's urban fabric and infrastructure was devastated by continuous aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe with almost 20,000 civilians killed and more than a million houses destroyed or damaged.Richards 1954, p. 217. Hundreds of thousands of citizens had been evacuated to safer areas, and the reconstruction of a habitable urban environment became a national emergency. The re-housing crisis, aligned with post-War optimism manifested in the Welfare State, afforded an opportunity and a duty for the architectural profession to rebuild the shattered capital. The internationally influential urban planner Sir Patrick Abercrombie established the 1943 County of London Plan, which set out redevelopment according to modernist principles of zoning and de-densification of historic urban areas. Accelerating pre-war trends, overcrowded urban populations were relocated to new suburban developments, allowing inner-city areas to be reconstructed. The Golden Lane Estate, followed by the Barbican by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, are regarded as casebook examples of urban reconstruction of the period in the City of London, where just 5,324 local residents had remained by the end of the war. The 1951 Festival of Britain, held on London's South Bank, became an important cultural landmark in sharing and disseminating optimism for future progress. The Royal Festival Hall (built 1948‚Äì1951) and the later South Bank Centre including the Hayward Gallery (1968), Queen Elizabeth Hall/Purcell Room (1967) and the Royal National Theatre (1976) remain as significant architectural and cultural legacies of the era.Trellick Tower (1972) by Erno Goldfinger, a distinctive example of Brutalist architecture and post war housing solutions in London. London had also attracted a select group of important European modernists, some as refugees from Nazism, and the post-war era presented opportunities for many to express their unique visions for modernism. Important European architects of the era include Berthold Lubetkin and Ern≈ë Goldfinger, who employed and trained architects on modernist social housing such as the Dorset Estate of 1957, Alexander Fleming House (1962‚Äì64), Balfron Tower of 1963 and Trellick Tower of 1966, as well as Keeling House by Denys Lasdun in 1957. International movements in architecture and urban planning were reflected in the new developments with separation of motor transportation and industrial and commercial uses from living areas, according to the prevailing orthodoxies of the CIAM.Modern Architecture: A Critical History (1980; revised 1985, 1992 and 2007) Kenneth Frampton High-rise residential developments of council housing in London were above all else influenced by Le Corbusier's Unit√© d'habitation (or Cit√© Radieuse (\\"Radiant City\\") of 1947‚Äì52. The architecture of post war modernism was informed by ideals of technological progress and social progress through egalitarianism; this was expressed by humanistic repetition of forms and use of the modernist material par excellence ‚Äì B√©ton brutRaw Concrete: The Beauty of Brutalism, Barnabas Calder or 'raw concrete'. Significant council housing works in London include the Brunswick Centre (1967‚Äì72) by Patrick Hodgkinson and the Alexandra Road Estate (1972‚Äì78) by Neave Brown of the Camden Council architects department. The British exponents of the internationalist movement were headed by Alison and Peter Smithson, originally as part of Team 10; they went on to design Robin Hood Gardens (1972) in Bow and The Economist Building (1962‚Äì4) in Mayfair, regarded by architects as some of the very finest works of British New Brutalism. Many schools, residential housing and public buildings were built over the period; however the failure of some the modernist ideals, coupled with poor quality of construction and poor maintenance by building owners, has resulted in a somewhat negative popular perception of the architecture of the era; this is, however, being transformed and expressed in the enduring value and prestige of refurbished developments such as the Barbican, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower, regarded by many as architectural \\"icons\\" of a distant era of confidently heroic progressive social constructivism and highly sought-after places of residence. Postmodernism, High-Tech and High-Rise Architecture (1980-Present) = Postmodern and High Tech Architecture = SIS or MI6 Building by Terry Farrell (1996) is a distinctive example of postmodern architecture. The late 1970s is considered to be a stylistic turning point in the history of architecture. Formed in reaction against the austere modernism which had dominated architectural design since the end of world war II, the postmodern school - which first expressed itself in the controversial book Learning from Las Vegas (1973) by Robert Venturi - was a movement that rejected minimalism by embracing irony, playfulness, pop culture and quoting historical styles in their buildings. The result was an eccentric new style that couldn't be in starker contrast to the rigid post war consensus of the international style. London contains some notable examples of postmodern architecture, mostly from the 1990s. Robert Venturi's Sailsbury Wing of the National Gallery (1991) is an poignant example of postmodern historical pastiche, being built of portland stone and ironically imitating the neoclassical style of the original National Gallery in order to blend in with the older building. Two of the postmodern movement's most influential architects Terry Farrell and James Stirling were both British and many of their most significant works can be found in London. Perhaps London's best-known postmodernist building, Terry Farrell's SIS Building or MI6 Building (1996) in Vauxhall, is a highly distinctive pyramidal design that was heavily influenced by Maya and Aztec Architecture; it is the headquarters of Britain's military intelligence agency. James Stirling's No.1 Poultry (1997) has been highly commended as a masterpiece of the postmodernist style becoming grade II* listed in 2016. Occupying the east corner of Bank Junction, its unusual design incorporates a pink terracotta fa√ßade containing equestrian sculptures and an unusual clock tower resembling a submarine conning tower. It controversially replaced a neo-gothic building of the 19th century. The Great Court of The British Museum (2000) a notable example of high-tech architecture by Fosters and Partners. A splinter movement of the postmodern movement that started to become prominent in the 1990s is the high-tech style and the similar neo-futurist style. These two styles embrace much of the eccentricity of the postmodern style in their utilisation of unusual forms and shapes, whilst also taking cues from the modernist movement in their embrace of functionality and utopianism. In terms of construction there is an emphasis on the usage of glass, steel and high-tech production processes, as well as exposing the structural and utilitarian elements of the building as a means of decoration. A revolutionary example of the high-tech movement can be seen in the form of The Lloyd's Building (1986) by Richard Rogers, an unusual ‚Äòinside- out‚Äô design in which all the building's utilities; its lifts, ducts and vents are placed on the outside rather than on the inside of the building acting as an external fa√ßade. The building is Grade I listed in recognition of its significance. The pre-eminence of the high-tech style in London began to emerge in the late 1990s and became closely associated with its most prolific architect: Norman Foster and his practice Fosters and Partners. Significant high-tech works by Forster include The Great Court of The British Museum; a distinctive glass dome structure built over the central courtyard of the original 19th century building, City Hall (2002) on the South Bank with its distinctive ovular shape and the iconic skyscraper 30 St Mary Axe (2003) perhaps his most famous building. 30 St Mary Axe ‚Äì often known colloquially as ‚ÄòThe Gherkin‚Äô - has been much praised around the world winning the Stirling Prize as well as winning a 2006 poll as the most admired building by the world's leading architects. 30 St Mary Axe was a major turning point in high rise architecture in London with many other buildings following suit with a similar high-tech/neo-futurist style, examples include The Shard (2012), 122 Leadenhall Street (2014) 20 Fenchurch Street (2015) and 1 Blackfriars (2018).30 St Mary Axe (2003) by Foster and Partners (often referred to as 'The Gherkin') has become one of London's most iconic high rise buildings. = Contemporary High Rise Architecture in London = The NatWest Tower (now called Tower 42) was completed in 1980, which at 183 metres (600 ft) and 42 storeys, was considered the first \\"skyscraper\\" in the City of London. Its height was controversial, being contrary to the previous height restrictions, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom at the time and also the tallest cantilever building in the world. Following an over ten-year gap, One Canada Square was completed in 1991 at 235 metres (771 ft) and formed the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development, which itself is part of the Isle of Dogs and can be considered the east-side of Central London. The development's main tower One Canada Square became the tallest building in the United Kingdom. With the encouragement of Ken Livingstone who was Mayor of London from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s. Following another over 10-year gap, 8 Canada Square and 25 Canada Square, both standing at 200 metres (660 ft), were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: Heron Quays, 40 Bank Street in 2003 at 153 metres (502 ft), 10 Upper Bank Street in 2003 at 151 metres (495 ft), and 25 Bank Street in 2004 at 153 metres (502 ft). In the City of London, 30 St Mary Axe, nicknamed \\"the Gherkin\\" was completed in 2003 at 180 metres (590 ft), Heron Tower in 2007 at 230 metres (750 ft), and the Broadgate Tower in 2008 at 165 metres (541 ft). Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2003 and the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2004. (left) City Hall (2002) Fosters and Partners and (right) The Shard (2012) Renzo Piano, two notable works of high-tech and neo-futurist architecture. Boris Johnson who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London. The Shard topped out in 2012 at London Bridge and at 309.6 metres (1,016 ft) remains London's tallest building. In 2014, the 225 metres (738 ft) tall 122 Leadenhall Street, nicknamed \\"the Cheesegrater\\", was completed in the City of London. In September, 2016 a refit was completed of the 111m King's Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to 150 metres (490 ft) tall and it was renamed the South Bank Tower. One Blackfriars, also located on the South Bank, topped out in 2017 at 163 metres (535 ft). The Scalpel, at 190 metres (620 ft) was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul's Catherdral. Newfoundland Quay, at 220 metres (720 ft) and Landmark Pinnacle at 233 metres (764 ft) topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. One Park Drive at 205 metres (673 ft) and South Quay Plaza at 215 metres (705 ft) both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. 22 Bishopsgate, at 278 metres (912 ft) topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in 2016. 1 Undershaft, at 290 metres (950 ft), also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen's building which will be demolished. 100 Leadenhall, at 249 metres (817 ft), and already nicknamed the \\"Cheesegrater 2\\", is also planned for the City of London. Spire London, at 235 metres (771 ft) is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two Riverside South towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster's tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the 216 metres (709 ft) tall Consort Place (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf. There is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the Vauxhall and Nine Elms districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was St George Wharf Tower at 181 metres (594 ft) and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the 200 metres (660 ft) One Nine Elms City Tower. In 2019, Sadiq Khan blocked the construction of the 290 metre tall Tulip that would have been built in the City of London. However, in January, 2020, the developers of the tower launched an appeal against Khan's decision which is to be considered at a public inquiry in the middle of the year.

Plot summary  By the time this book opens, characters Calwyn, Trout, Tonno, Halassa and Mica are making and enacting plans to rescue chanters from their various underprivileged situations and form a school of chantment; thus integrating the Nine Songs by which nature is commanded, as well as their singers, into society. While Calwyn and her friends are freeing windworkers from pirates' ships, they meet Heben, a former (exiled) princeling from the continent of Merithuros, who was a prisoner of the pirates'. On the island where the rescued windworkers live, Heben tells them that the ironcraft chanter children of Merithuros are being kidnapped, among them his (legal) brother and sister. Calwyn and her friends embark for the desert of Merithuros to rescue the captured children. Trout, the inventor, decides to remain behind. Darrow is alone on his boat Heron, where he reminiscences about his childhood. It is revealed that he was the son of a sea-captain and was nicknamed \\"Mouse\\" by the family-like crew. During his pre-adolescent years, Mouse discovered that a crew member named Arram was an ironcrafter, and that he himself could use the same gift. At his request, Arram secretly taught Mouse to use ironcraft, enabling him to manipulate matter by his songs. While docking at a Merithuran town, Mouse sang ironcraft to save his father from falling cargo. A Merithuran sorcerer saw this and took the terrified child away. Calwyn, Tonno, Mica, Halasaa, and Heben travel to Merithuros on the boat Fledgewing. There the outsiders of the group learn of the discontent lives of the common folk, who try to protest the cruelty of the Merithuran Empire. Tonno stays on the ship whilst the others ride on the goatlike \\"hegesi\\" to the Palace of Cobwebs where the royalty live. There, the group hope to learn where the kidnapped children are. Along the way, Calwyn and Mica earn the chauvinistic Heben's respect through their use of chantment. After many days of riding, they finally reach the Palace of Cobwebs. Darrow returns to the island of Ravamey, his current refuge, and learns that Calwyn and others have left. He is given cause to think that they have gone to the Black Palace, where the chanter children are actually held. Darrow is revealed to have lived in the Black Palace during his childhood. It is there that he acquired his name, which was derived from the title of his father's ship, Gold Arrow; there that he was given extensive training in the use of ironcraft by the harsh, partisan, cruel Merithuran sorcerers; and there that he first met the power- mad Samis. Calwyn and friends are inside the Palace of Cobwebs. Calwyn, disguised as a noblewoman and the others as her servants, have no success in learning anything useful, though they note the presence of chantment, implying the children to be nearby. Also present is a sorcerer of the Black Palace, Amagis by name, who recognizes their powers but does not confront them. Instead, he persuades Third Princess Keela to ingratiate herself with Calwyn, in hope of learning more about the latter. This is only a partially successful venture. After a parade and during a feast, the aged Emperor suddenly falls ill and dies. In the resulting clamor, the seekers sneak away and split up to search for the children. Darrow is sailing to Merithuros, while recalling to attention that Samis had singled him out as an ally, naming him \\"Heron\\". When the old lord of the Black Palace was dying, Samis seized his office and the Ring that signified it. He later attempted to persuade Darrow to join him in the quest to become Singer of All Songs and conquer the world; Darrow refused, cast away the name \\"Heron\\", and fled, later to meet Calwyn. Calwyn finds Shada, Heben's legal sister, trapped on a tower. To keep her there, Shada's kidnapper has broken the bones of her feet. Shada explains that five of the kidnapped children, including herself, are hidden in the Palace of Cobwebs, where they sing chantments to keep the palace intact. Halasaa heals Shada and they escape from the pursuing Amagis. The group reunites and search for the four other children. Calwyn and one of the children, Ched, try to warn the inhabitants of the steadily collapsing Palace while the others steal supplies and escape. No one pays attention to Calwyn, except Keela, who tries to take Ched from her. Calwyn and Ched escape, leaving the palace just as the palace collapses. Calwyn uses Ironcraft for the first time to assist in their escape. Falling debris kills Ched. Calwyn overhears some soldiers conspiring to crown the Fifth Prince so that they can control the dimwitted man and rule the Empire through him. Darrow meets Tonno at a Merithuran harbor. At a bar, Darrow meets the leader of the commoners who want to rebel against the empire. Darrow earns a partnership by promising to take the leader, Fenn, to the fabled Black Palace. Calwyn and friends travel towards the Black Palace. Halasaa becomes ill along the way, because of the barrenness of the land. In his telepathic conversations with Calwyn and other characters, Halasaa reveals that Merithuros was once a fertile, generous land, but was reduced to wasteland by humans. When confronted by wasunti (wild dogs), Calwyn uses the Power of Beasts to turn them away. Oron, one of the children, is bitten by one of the wasunti. Halasaa teaches Calwyn the Power of Becoming, with which Calwyn heals Oron. Possibly as a result, Calwyn almost faints from exhaustion. When she awakes, they have been saved by Darrow, Tonno, and the rebels. They head to the Lip of Hathara, which is a stone wall surrounding the Black Palace. Darrow and the children rescued from the Palace of Cobwebs (except for Ched who died) use ironcraft to open a doorway, but do not close it. This leaves an entryway for the army and nobles led by Keela, who are all heading to the Palace. When the protagonists enter, they are attacked by the sorcerers. Oron goes missing, later to be discovered, threatened and suborned by Keela. Darrow reveals the Ring of Lyonssar, making himself the Lord of the Black Palace. This confuses Calwyn, who associates such a manouevre with the desire for control. Later, Darrow explains his methods, whereas Calwyn disclaims any division that he has suspected her of having in her affections. Darrow also reveals that the Black Palace can, if its mechanisms are released, become a wind-powered war machine, similar to a terrestrial warship. Calwyn compares the sorcerers' tradition of living in the Black Palace to the tradition in which she was raised, wherein priestesses hide behind walls of ice, and wishes that the chanters would \\"come out of hiding\\". On the roof of the palace, Calwyn and Darrow share a passionate kiss (during which Darrow's ring becomes caught in Calwyn's hair), finally acting on their feelings for each other. In the next morning, the remaining imperial soldiers are advancing toward the Black Palace. Darrow rallies sorcerers, rebels, and his friends, invoking them to build a Republic on the ruins of the Empire, wherein a more generous way of life is followed. When the various factions begin to quarrel, Darrow reveals the soldiers to them as a common enemy, whereupon all unite in their opposition to this. Heben, impromptu, questions the wisdom of war and suggests that all factions co-operate rather than compete. Darrow supports this idea. Tonno discuses with Calwyn their means of getting back to Ravamey. He assumes that Darrow will stay here and assume the role of Lord of the Black Palace. This saddens Calwyn, because despite the fact that Darrow has finally acted on his love for her, she must leave him in Merithurous to fulfill his duty. In addition, Halassa is sick and needs her aid more at the moment than does Darrow. The imperial army attacks; moments later, Oron unwillingly obeys Keela's order to activate the mechanisms of the Black Palace, which are a series of metal pipes. When air is run over the pipes correctly, the pipes create a chant of Ironcraft powerful enough to move the Black Palace itself. As it advances menacingly, Calwyn responds to the needs of the injured land and uses all of her chantment to heal it. In the process, she sacrifices all of her own power to sing. Using chantment, Darrow halts the Black Palace in its path saving Calwyn. As a result of Calwyn's chantment, the region called Hathara becomes the site of a lake, into which all the fighters throw their weapons. Because his sickness and weakness corresponded with that of the land, Halasaa is restored to health even as the land is revived. Keela is captured; although she attempts to talk her way out of trouble, she is imprisoned at Darrow's command. It is revealed that Keela believes Samis to be alive; because Darrow doubts the clarity of his own perception of Samis as dead, he is frightened by this information. Calwyn, upon regaining her strength, is distraught to find that she has lost all of her chantment. She watches aimlessly as Heben, Darrow, Tonno, and the leaders of the various Merithuran factions build the foundations of their new Republic. Eventually, she is approached by Darrow. He attempts to console her without much success. He then reveals that he intends to seek Samis, to discover whether he is in fact alive, and if he is so to kill him. Darrow discusses the future with Calwyn, suggesting that she might go back to Antaris to heal, and eventually asks her to promise him that if she returns to Antaris in search of healing, she will not go alone, but in the company of friends, and to promise him that she will return upon success or failure. When she does not promise to return, arguing that she cannot ensure it, he leaves her, disappointed.  Characters  Calwyn is a 17-year-old priestess from Antaris. Calwyn has matured since her adventure from Darrow's departure and from freeing windworkers from pirates, to the extent of thinking ahead and in terms of that which is best for the world. Calwyn is a compassionate young woman, but tends to be stubborn. Calwyn is resentful of women's roles outside of Antaris and strives for gender equality. Calwyn becomes a noblewoman of the Palace of Cobwebs and manages to save the kidnapped children. She flees with Heben, Mica, Halasaa, and the children to the Black Palace and almost dies. They are saved by Darrow and the commoners and end the corruption of the Black Palace. When the palace is started, Calwyn tries to heal the land and is successful but is stripped of her powers. Darrow is Calwyn's beloved, possibly five to ten years her elder. Darrow was born to a Penlewin captain and raised on the seas. His tendency to scamper along the ship gave him the name \\"Mouse.\\" Darrow was taught the basics of iron chantment from a crew member, Arram, who warned him to keep this power secret. When docking at a Merithuran town, Darrow used iron chantment to save his father from being crushed by falling cargo. A Merithuran sorcerer saw this and took Darrow to the Black Palace of Hathara, where Darrow was raised as an ironcrafter. When Darrow was tested for obedience, he passed the test and was accepted as one of the sullen community of sorcerers. When Samis sought to master his gift of iron chantment and came to the Black Palace, he befriended Darrow. The two became close friends, but when Samis revealed his plans to conquer Tremaris, Darrow fled. Darrow becomes Lord of the Black Palace, in which position he becomes a reformer. Tonno is a fisherman from Kalysons who, like Mica, is at home at sea. He takes Calwyn and company to Merithuros and remains on Fledgewing until Darrow appears. He then travels with Darrow to Hathara. Mica is the young windworker whom Calwyn and her friends rescued from pirates. She is active and rebellious. Mica joins Calwyn at the Palace of Cobwebs as her servant and spy. She uses her chantments to help sail herself and friends about. Heben is a tribal exile from Merithuros. When the abduction of his brother Gada and sister Shada by the sorcerers of Hathara went unpunished, Heben protested and was subsequently banished. He was rescued by Calwyn from a pirate ship. Upon learning of her powers, he requested that they rescue his siblings; they agreed, and therefore travelled to Merithuros with him. There, he became their guide through the desert and through Merithuran society. Trout is one of Calwyn's friends from Mithates where the Power of Fire origin. A young, nearsighted inventor with little tolerance for the ocean. He remains on the island with the rescued windworkers. Halasaa is one of the voiceless, secluded Tree People. He is the last of the chanters of the healing magic called the chantment of Becoming. He communicates telepathically and can be very intuitive. He is compassionate, like Calwyn, but more connected to natural ecosystems until the climax. When traveling to the Black Palace, Halasaa becomes ill from the dead land and weakened by needing constantly to heal the others. Halasaa teaches Calwyn the Dance of Healing so she can heal one of the injured chanter children. He recovers at the end, when Calwyn heals Merithuros itself. Keela the Third and most attractive Princess of the Merithuran court. She pretends to be Calwyn's friend in order to spy on her. Keela can either be frivolous and charming or cunning and witty. She schemes to become the Empress of Merithros and later Tremaris. All that she has done has been for her half-brother, Samis, whom she claims is still alive. Gada and Shada are two kidnapped twins that Calwyn and her friends rescue with the help of Heben. They are two of a large number of children seized over the years by the sorcerers of the Black Palace of Hathara for training in the ways of Ironcraft. Heben is the twins' brother by law, although genetically unrelated to them. Amagis one of the sorcerers from the Black Palace; called the \\"Ambassador of Hathara.\\" He was tricked by Keela's charm into telling her all that he knew about the chanter children; he remained at the Palace because of his soft spot for her. Amagis tried to stop Calwyn from saving the chanter children, but is killed himself when Calwyn sings a wind chantment that blows him off the tower where they stood. Arram one of the crew members of the ship Gold Arrow, where Darrow was born. It is Arram who introduced the boy, then called \\"Mouse\\", to chantment. Ched one of the chanter children imprisoned in the Palace of Cobwebs. Rescued by Calwyn. He is killed when falling debris from the Palace of Cobwebs strikes his head. Oron one of the chanter children imprisoned in the Palace of Cobwebs. He is resentful of the world for his imprisonment. At the Black Palace, Oron escaped into the ventilation system when the sorcerers attacked; Keela threatened to kill Oron if he didn't help her start the war engine of the palace. The scheme is stopped in its tracks. Oron is punished, though not treated as severely as Keela, because of his having acted under duress. 2003 Australian novels Fantasy novels ","title":"The Waterless Sea"},{"id":"5748110","text":"The Book of Gad the Seer is a presumed lost text, supposed to have been written by the Biblical prophet Gad, which is mentioned at .

Pseudepigraphic book of the same name There is a pseudepigraphic book by the same title, extant in the form of a manuscript from the Black Jews of Cochin, India. The manuscript now in the Cambridge Library is a relatively recent (19th century) copy. According to Solomon Schechter, this manuscript is copied from a document purporting to be from Rome, and the late linguistic forms and features of the Hebrew manuscript, as well as its substantial similarity with some medieval Kabbalistic literature and some aspects of Christianity, indicate a relatively late date. He regards it therefore as not dating back to antiquity.Schechter, Solomon, Note on Hebrew Manuscripts in the University Library at Cambridge (Part IV), Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 6, nr. 1 (Oct. 1893) page 140; Lieberman, Abraham A., Again: The Words of Gad the Seer, Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 111, nr. 2 (Summer 1992) pages 313-314; Kimelman, Reuven, Psalm 145: Theme, Structure, and Impact, Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 113, nr. 1 (Spring 1994) page 50. However, according to Professor Meir Bar Ilan, although some linguistic aspects of the Hebrew manuscript are of late date, there is evidence that the book originated in approximately the 1st or 2nd century C.E. A scholarly edition of the book was published in August 2015, edited by Professor Meir Bar Ilan of Bar Ilan University. The book also includes an English translation of the original text.

Mass migration refers to the migration of large groups of people from one geographical area to another. Mass migration is distinguished from individual or small scale migration; and also from seasonal migration, which may occur on a regular basis. A specific mass migration that is seen as especially influential to the course of history may be referred to as a 'great migration'. For example, great migrations include the Indo-European migrations to Europe, the Middle East and South Asia during the Bronze Age, the Bantu migrations across sub-Saharan Africa, Barbarian invasions during the Roman Empire, the Great Migration from England of the 1630s, the California Gold Rush from 1848-1850, the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural American south to the industrial north during 1920-1950, and The Great Oromo Migrations of Oromo tribes during the 15th and 16th centuries in the Horn of Africa. UNHCR estimates 20 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were displaced during the partition of India, the largest mass migration in human history. The largest documented voluntary emigration in history was the Italian diaspora, which migrated from Italy between 1880 and 1915, with 13 million people leaving the country.Ben-Ghiat and Hom, ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù to Italian Mobilities (Routledge, 2016) From Emigration to Asylum Destination, Italy Navigates Shifting Migration Tides migrationpolicy.org] Mass migrations may be forced migrations, such as the Atlantic slave trade. Mass migrations can occur due to religious persecution, such as the biblical Exodus and the migration through the upper Himalayan route from the east by Purohits of Aryan and non- Aryan descent. Similarly, mass migrations may take place in the form of deportation, such as deportations in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, deportations to Gulag camps in the Soviet Union, and coolie labour in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Age of Mass Migration Historians often identify an \\"age of mass migration\\" occurring from c. 1850 to 1914 (sometimes 1940), in which long distance migration occurred at an unprecedented and exceptionally high rate. There were three factors that led to the 'age of mass migration'. First, the cost of migration decreased dramatically. Second, the benefits of migration rose (the return on migration was higher in the United States than in other countries). Third, open border regimes encouraged migration. The 'age of mass migration' usually refers to the voluntary transatlantic migration of European peasants and laborers to the Americas. Immigration from Europe accounted for about 40% of the total United States population growth in the late 19th century. It has been argued that the term should include other mass migrations that occurred in the same period, since similarly, large numbers of people migrated long distances within the continent of Asia, most notably during the Pakistan Movement and the subsequent partition of India in 1947. During open border regimes, immigrants were attracted by the falling costs of migration and higher wages in the United States. The partition of India caused the movement of 18 million people. This caused both religious and civil tensions between Hindus and Muslims.3k. Separation: India and Pakistan [Beyond Books - Culture and Geography] This resulted in the highest casualty rate for one migration according to the Guinness Book of World Records 2014. One million people were killed and 12 million became homeless.

Carter founded and led the non-profit environmental justice solutions corporation Sustainable South Bronx from 2001 onward, before entering the private sector in 2008. Early life Carter was born in South Bronx, New York where she attended the Head Start Program and primary schools. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, she entered Wesleyan University in 1984 to study film and went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts. In 1997, she received a Master of Fine Arts from New York University (NYU). While at NYU, she returned to her family's home in Hunts Point, and later worked for The Point Community Development Corporation. While Associate Director of The POINT Community Development Corporation, Carter initiated the development of Hunts Point Riverside Park. Carter was \\"pulled by her dog into a weedy vacant lot strewn with trash at the dead end of Lafayette Avenue. As the pair plowed through the site they ended up, much to Carter's surprise, on the banks of the Bronx River.\\" From there, Carter secured a $10,000 grant from a USDA Forest Service program to provide seed money for river access restoration projects. Over a five-year period she worked with other community members and the Parks Department to help leverage that seed money into more than $3 million from the mayor's budget. The money was used to build the park into the Rudy Bruner award-winning iteration which re-opened in 2006. Career =Advocacy= In August 2001, after exploring and then declining to engage in a campaign for NY City Council, Carter founded Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx), where she served as executive directorTheodore J.

During that time, SSBx advocated the development of the Hunt's Point Riverside Park which had been an illegal garbage dump. Carter was a co-founder of the Bronx River Alliance [bronxriveralliance.org], and SSBx continued to carry on Carter's involvement in Bronx River waterfront restoration projects. In 2003, Sustainable South Bronx started the Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training program,Sustainable South Bronx: Green Jobs, Not Jails Green for All. Accessed online 5 January 2009. one of the nation's first urban green collar training and placement systems. Other SSBx projects have centered around fitness, food choices (including the creation of a community market), and air quality. Majora Carter in Hunts Point In 2007, Carter co-founded Green for All with Van Jones. A December 2008 New York Times profile called Carter \\"The Green Power Broker\\" and \\"one of the city's best-known advocates for environmental justice\\" but reported that some South Bronx activists (who would not go on record) stated that Carter has taken credit for accomplishments when others should share the credit as well as taking credit for uncompleted projects. Other Bronx activists (who did agree to be named) stated that her recognition was well deserved. Carter was a torch-bearer for a portion of the San Francisco leg of the torch relay of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Many portions of the torch relay, including the San Francisco leg, were met with protests concerning the policies of the Chinese government toward Tibet. Although Carter had signed a contract pledging not to use an Olympic venue for political or religious causes, when she and John Caldera were passed the torch during their part of the relay, she pulled out a small Tibetan flag that she had concealed in her shirt sleeve. Members of the Chinese torch security escort team pulled her out of the relay and San Francisco police officers pushed her into the crowd on the side of the street. Fellow torch-bearer, retired NYFD firefighter Richard Doran, who was making his own personal and political statement by wearing a helmet to refer to the firefighters who died in the September 11 attacks, called Carter's actions \\"disgusting and appalling\\" and said that he thought \\"she dishonored herself and her family\\". Another torch-bearer, retired NYPD police officer Jim Dolan, agreed with Doran. =Media= Majora Carter's TED talk was one of the first six publicly released talks to launch the TED.com website in 2006. Carter has made appearances in, and/or written, and produced television and radio programs, including HBO's The Black List volume 2, American Public Media's Market Place, and PRX's This I Believe series and has hosted several pieces on urban sustainability with Discovery Communications' Science Channel. Carter interviews Shai Agassi in 2008 She has been featured in corporate promotional videos and advertisements for companies such as Cisco Systems, Frito-Lay, Intel, Holiday Inn, HSBC, Visa, Mazda and Honda. In 2014, Carter was the on-camera and voice over host of \\"Water Blues - Green Solutions\\", a one-hour documentary on Green Infrastructure in several American cities, produced by Pennsylvania State University TV for the Public TV Market. In 2015, Carter played \\"TSA Agent 1\\" opposite Meryl Streep in Ricky and the Flash, directed by Johnathon Demme. From 2007‚Äì2010, Carter appeared on The Green, a television segment dedicated to the environment, shown on the Sundance Channel.The Green on Sundance Channel. Accessed online June 17, 2007 The first season consisted of a series of 90 second op-eds shot in studio. The second season consisted of a series of short interview pieces with individuals taking uncommon approaches to environmental problems. In 2008, Carter and Marge Ostroushko co-produced the pilot episode of the public radio show, The Promised Land (radio), which won a 3-way competition for a Corporation for Public Broadcasting Talent Quest grant. The one-hour programs debuted on over 150 public radio stations across the US on January 19, 2009, was renewed for the 2010/2011 season, and earned a 2010 Peabody Award, but went unsupported by the public radio funding organizations after that period, and has since stopped production. Carter co-authored a white paper on urban heat island mitigation and a peer-reviewed article, Elemental carbon and PM(2.5) levels in an urban community heavily impacted by truck traffic. =Consulting= After leaving Sustainable South Bronx, Carter has served as president of a private consulting firm, Majora Carter Group, LLC (MCG). In the June 2010 issue of Fast Company magazine, Carter was listed as one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business. In 2014, B Corporation (certification) recognized MCG as one of the \\"Best for the World\\" according to its ranking among other B Corps of similar size. In 2012, Carter's consulting firm, Majora Carter Group LLC (MCG) accepted FreshDirect as a client to help the company and local organizations connect prior to its proposed relocation to the Harlem River Yards in the South Bronx.DNAinfo Activists opposed to the relocation, claimed New York City Government and FreshDirect failed to conduct sufficient environmental review and community outreach. A lawsuit and boycott campaign were initiated to stop the relocation. That lawsuit was dismissed, and a subsequent appeal was also dismissed; both were filed by New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. Sustainable South Bronx, an organization Carter founded, opposed FreshDirect's move to the Bronx. Subsequent votes by Bronx Community Board 1 and the NYC Industrial Development Agency both voted to approve the move to the Bronx. South Bronx youth development NGO leader Maryann Hedaa stated that Carter \\"realizes that fighting poverty has to be a partnership between the public interests and the private interests.\\"NY Daily News Regarding the negative attitude among Bronx activists towards Carter's position, Steve Ritz, founder of Green Bronx Machine, noted that \\"It's much easier to run your mouth than run a business.\\" The project broke ground Dec, 22, 2014 and was scheduled to be completed before the end of 2016. FreshDirect started hiring in the Bronx ahead of its move in anticipation. =Tech-Economy Inclusion= In 2007, while running Sustainable South Bronx, Majora Carter introduced MIT's first ever Mobile fab lab (digital fabrication laboratory) to the South Bronx, where it served as an early iteration of the \\"maker spaces\\" found elsewhere today. The project drew residents and visitors together for guided and creative collaborations. In 2013, Carter joined the Advisory Board member of the Bronx Academy of Software Engineering High School. After Co- Founding StartUp Box #SouthBronx in 2012 as a social enterprise to seed diverse participation in the knowledge economy, she launched StartUp Box #QA (Quality Assurance testing services) which assisted in the launch of Mayor Bill DeBlasio's Digital.NYC in 2014. Carter then took StartUp Box to victory at the national Blogher Conference in 2015, winning the pitch contest with $250,000 worth of in-kind services from SheKnows Media. The social enterprise eventually went on to win second place in both the MIT Inclusion Innovation and the Village Capital & Kapoor Capital People Ops Competitions in 2016, (each garnering a $25,000 prize), as well as the Digital Diversity Network's Code Breaker Award in 2016 She is a BusinessInsider.com 'Silicon Alley 100', and her 2006 TEDtalk was one of 6 to launch that groundbreaking site.

It is maintained by the model developers and distributed by TRC. The model has been adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its Guideline on Air Quality Models Appendix W of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 51 as a preferred model for assessing long range transport of pollutants and their impacts on Federal Class I areas and on a case-by-case basis for certain near- field applications involving complex meteorological conditions. The integrated modeling system consists of three main components and a set of preprocessing and postprocessing programs. The main components of the modeling system are CALMET (a diagnostic 3-dimensional meteorological model), CALPUFF (an air quality dispersion model), and CALPOST (a postprocessing package). Each of these programs has a graphical user interface (GUI). In addition to these components, there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare geophysical (land use and terrain) data in many standard formats, meteorological data (surface, upper air, precipitation, and buoy data), and interfaces to other models such as the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Eta model and the RAMS meteorological model. The CALPUFF model is designed to simulate the dispersion of buoyant, puff or continuous point and area pollution sources as well as the dispersion of buoyant, continuous line sources. The model also includes algorithms for handling the effect of downwash by nearby buildings in the path of the pollution plumes. History The CALPUFF model was originally developed by the Sigma Research Corporation (SRC) in the late 1980s under contract with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and it was first issued in about 1990. The Sigma Research Corporation subsequently became part of Earth Tech, Inc. After the US EPA designated CALPUFF as a preferred model in their Guideline on Air Quality Models, Earth Tech served as the designated distributor of the model. In April 2006, ownership of the model switched from Earth Tech to the TRC Environmental Corporation. More recently ownership transferred to Exponent, who are currently (December 2015) responsible for maintaining and distributing the model.

De Leath was an early exponent of a style of vocalizing known as crooning. One of her hit songs, \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?,\\" recorded in 1927, achieved fame when it became a hit for Elvis Presley in 1960. Early life Born Leonore Vonderlieth in the town of Mount Pulaski, Illinois in 1894, her parents were George and Catherine Vonderlieth. At age 12, Leonore relocated to Los Angeles with her mother and sister, where she finished high school and studied music. While at Mills College, she began writing songs, but dropped out to pursue a singing career. She then adopted the stage name \\"Vaughn De Leath.\\" Her vocals ranged from soprano to deep contralto. De Leath adapted to the emerging, less restrictive jazz vocal style of the late 1910s and early 1920s. Music career In January 1920, inventor and radio pioneer Lee DeForest brought her to the cramped studio of his station, 2XG, located in New York City's World's Tower, where De Leath broadcast \\"Swanee River\\". Although not, as is sometimes stated, the first broadcast of live singing,DeForest had made earlier one-time demonstrations featuring Eugenia Farrar in 1907, Enrico Caruso in January, 1909, and Mme. Mariette Mazarin on February 24, 1910. she established herself as a skilled radio performer, and De Forest would later note: \\"She was an instant success. Her voice and her cordial, unassuming microphone presence were ideally suited to the novel task. Without instruction she seemed to sense exactly what was necessary in song and patter to successfully put herself across\\".Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, page 351. According to some historical accounts of this incident, having been advised that high notes sung in her natural soprano might shatter the fragile vacuum tubes of her carbon microphone's amplifier, De Leath switched to a deep contralto and in the process invented \\"crooning\\",Irving Settel, A Pictorial History of Radio, p. 58, Grosset & Dunlap (1967). which became the dominant pop vocal styling for the next three decades. By 1921, in the formative years of commercial radio, De Leath began singing at WJZ, in Newark, New Jersey (a station later known as WABC in New York City). She also performed on the New York stage in the early to mid-1920s, but radio became her primary medium, and she made a name for herself as a radio entertainer. Her recording career began in 1921. Over the next decade she recorded for a number of labels, including Edison, Columbia, Victor, Okeh, Gennett, and Brunswick. She occasionally recorded for the subsidiary labels of some of these companies under various pseudonyms.Dismuke.org These included Gloria Geer, Mamie Lee, Sadie Green, Betty Brown, Nancy Foster, Marion Ross, Glory Clarke, Angelina Marco, and Gertrude Dwyer. De Leath had a highly versatile range of styles, and as material required could adapt as a serious balladeer, playful girl, vampish coquette, or vaudeville comedian. \\"Ukulele Lesson\\" 78 rpm disc labelDe Leath also recorded songs for silent films, and composed songs, such as \\"Oliver Twist\\", written by the singer herself, for the 1922 silent film Oliver Twist.Ken Wlaschin The silent cinema in song, 1896-1929 2009 - Page 119 \\"Oliver Twist, the 1922 Jackie Coogan /Associated First National film, includes the song \\"Oliver Twist\\" by Vaughn DeLeath.

She demonstrated a high level of instrumental ability on the ukulele, and occasionally accompanied herself on recordings, including the 1925 hit \\"Ukulele Lady\\" (which was used in the 1999 film, The Cider House Rules). In performance she played banjo, guitar, and piano.

In 1928 she appeared on an experimental television broadcast, and later became a special guest for the debut broadcast of The Voice of Firestone radio show. She also was one of the first American entertainers to broadcast to Europe via transatlantic radio transmission. De Leath made her last recording in 1931 for the Crown label. She made her final nationwide network performances in the early 1930s. In her waning years, she made radio appearances on local New York stations, including WBEN in Buffalo. Marriages, career decline, and death De Leath was married twice. In 1924 she wed artist Leon Geer, from whom she was divorced in 1935. The following year, she married musician Irwin Rosenbloom, from whom she was divorced in 1941. In 1931, De Leath sued Kate Smith for using the \\"First Lady of the Radio\\" designation. Although Smith desisted for a time, she resumed the mantle after De Leath's death. After her career went into decline, De Leath endured considerable financial difficulties, complicated by a drinking problem, which contributed to her death at age 48 in Buffalo, New York. Her obituary in The New York Times stated her age at death as 42. Her ashes were buried in her childhood home of Mount Pulaski, Illinois.

It is the world's only protected area with an elevation gain of more than enclosing tropical forest as well as snow-capped peaks. It covers an area of in the Solukhumbu and Sankhuwasabha districts, and is surrounded by a bufferzone to the south and southeast with an area of . The rugged summits of Makalu, with the fifth highest mountain of the world, Chamalang (), Baruntse () and Mera () are included in the national park. The protected area extends to about from west to east and to about from north to south. From the Arun river valley in the southeast, located at altitudes of , elevation gains about to the peak of Makalu. The national park shares the international border with the Qomolangma National Nature Preserve of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the north. The protected area is part of the Sacred Himalayan Landscape. History Barun Valley In the early- and mid-1980s, personnel of The Mountain Institute (TMI) conducted surveys in the Barun Valley to study the biological richness. The results of these surveys led to interest in creating a new protected area. A respective proposal was formulated in 1985. In 1988, the Makalu-Barun Conservation Area Project (MBNPCA) was initiated as a joint endeavor of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and TMI. The MBNPCA was officially gazetted in 1991. At the time, about 32,000 people resided in the conservation area's 12 Village Development Committees, who are primarily subsistence farmers of Limbu, Sherpa, Yakkha, Gurung, Tamang, Magar, Newar, Brahmin and Chhetri ethnic groups. An innovative community-based conservation approach emphasized management of biodiversity together with local communities. Community Forest User Groups were created with legal rights to use designated forested areas on a sustainable basis. Ecotourism was promoted as a way of expanding off-farm employment opportunities for local people while at the same time minimizing negative environmental impact. Hunting and trapping of rare and endangered wild animals is strictly prohibited in the MBNPCA, except in extreme cases of threat to human life. There was also a provision for compensating farmers for crop and livestock depredation caused by endangered species.Mehta, J. N. and S. R. Kellert (1998). Local attitudes toward community-based conservation policy and programmes in Nepal: a case study in the Makalu-Barun Conservation Area. Environmental Conservation 25 (4): 320‚Äì333. In 1999, the conservation area was converted into a buffer zone. Under the Buffer Zone Management Guidelines the conservation of forests, wildlife and cultural resources received top priority, followed by conservation of other natural resources and development of alternative energy.Heinen, J.

The inaccessible valleys of the Barun River, the glacier-fed tributary to the Arun River, treasure some of the last remaining pristine forests and alpine meadows. This area has been designated as a Strict Nature Reserve, the first in Nepal, in order to protect natural ecosystems and processes in an undisturbed state for scientific study, environmental monitoring, education and the maintenance of genetic resources. Climate The park is located in the eastern climatic zone of the Himalayas, where monsoon starts in June and eases off in late September. During these months about 70% of the annual precipitation of falls. The first monsoon clouds reach the area in April. Temperatures vary greatly due to the extreme difference in altitude in the entire area. Lower elevations are temperate throughout winter and hot during April and May. The tropical and subtropical zones are frost free, with average monthly mean temperatures above .Zomer R. J., Ustin S. L. and Carpenter C. C. (2001). Land Cover Change Along Tropical and Subtropical Riparian Corridors Within the Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area, Nepal. Mountain Research and Development 21: 175‚Äì183. Vegetation Rhododendron arboreum ‚Äì the floral emblem of Nepal The Makalu Barun National Park exhibits a high diversity of forest types that are characteristic for the Eastern Himalayas, ranging from near-tropical dipterocarp monsoon forest on altitude to subalpine conifer stands on altitude. Forest aspects vary depending on seasonal moisture availability, temperature and snow cover at different elevations and slopes. Forests below are strongly affected by subsistence agriculture, so that only some ecologically significant stands remain there. Above forests are usually extensive since the cool, humid climate suppresses agricultural activity. Forests span five bioclimatic zones: * Tropical ‚Äì below with stands of Sal; * Subtropical ‚Äì from with stands of Schima and Castanopsis; * Lower and upper temperate ‚Äì from with predominantly broadleaf evergreen species of oak and laurel families and broadleaf deciduous stands of maple and magnolia; * Subalpine ‚Äì from with stands of Himalayan birch and East Himalayan fir; along a transect from outer, southern slopes to the inner valleys these stands are dominated by conifers such as juniper and fir. On alpine pastures at altitudes above the religiously important dwarf rhododendron and juniper, aromatic herbs and delicate wildflowers prosper. The region above comprises mainly rock and ice with little vegetation. Botanists recorded 3,128 species of flowering plants, including 25 of Nepal's 30 varieties of rhododendron, 48 primroses, 47 orchids, 19 bamboos, 15 oaks, 86 fodder trees and 67 economically valuable aromatic and medicinal plants.Shrestha, T.

It is with Theodo that the well-sourced history of Bavaria begins. He strengthened his duchy internally and externally and, according to the medieval chronicler Arbeo of Freising, he was a prince of great power whose fame extended beyond his borders. Life Theodo's descendance has not been conclusively established. A member of the Agilolfing dynasty, his father possibly was Duke Theodo IV of Bavaria (d. 680) and his mother was probably Fara of Bavaria (b. 600), daughter of one of the Kings of the Lombards and by her mother a granddaughter of Gisulf I of Friuli (b. 577). Theodo established his capital at Ratisbona (modern Regensburg). He married Folchaid, of the Frankish (possibly Robertian as the daughter of Robert II) aristocracy in Austrasia, to build diplomatic ties there. He intervened in Lombard affairs by harbouring the refugees Ansprand and Liutprand, whom he assisted militarily on his return to claim the Iron Crown. Liutprand later married his daughter Guntrude. Theodo also defended his duchy ably from the Avars (with some failure in the east). Theodo is the patron to the four great missionaries of Bavaria: Saint Rupert, Saint Erhard, Saint Emmeram, and probably Saint Corbinian. He was the first to draw up plans for the Bavarian church, aiming both at a deeper cultivation of the countryside as well as greater independence from the Frankish Kingdom by a closer association with the Pope. He was the first Bavarian duke to travel to Rome, where he conferred with Pope Gregory II. The diocesan seats were placed in the few urban centres, which served as the Duke's seats: Regensburg, Salzburg, Freising and Passau. Two of his children are involved with the death of Saint Emmeram. Theodo's daughter Uta had become pregnant by her lover. Fearing her father's wrath, she confided to Emmeram and the saint promised to bear the blame, as he was about to travel to Rome. Soon after his departure, Uta's predicament became known and in keeping with the agreement she named Emmeram as the father. Her brother Lantpert went after Emmeram and greeted him as \\"bishop and brother-in-law,\\" i.e., episcope et gener noster! Then he had Emmeram cut and torn into pieces. Theodo had the remains of the saint moved to Regensburg. Nothing more is known of Lantpert and Uta. Marriage and issue According to the Renaissance historians Ladislaus Sunthaym (c.1440‚Äì1512/13) and Johannes Aventinus (1477‚Äì1534), Theodo married Regintrud, possibly a daughter of King Dagobert I of Austrasia. However, the Verbr√ºderungsbuch codex of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg only mentions one Folchaid, probably a daughter of the Robertian count Theutacar in Wormsgau. They had the following children: * Theodbert, Duke of Bavaria in Salzburg 711/12‚Äìc.719 * Theobald, Duke of Bavaria in Regensburg c.711/12‚Äì717/19 * Tassilo II, Duke of Bavaria in Passau (?) 717‚Äì719 * Grimoald, Duke of Bavaria in Freising c.716‚Äì724 * a daughter who married her Agilolfing cousin Duke Gotfrid of Alamannia Theodo was eventually succeeded by his four other sons, between whom he divided his duchy sometime before 715. As early as 702, his eldest son Theodbert had been reigning from Salzburg and from 711 or 712 was the co-ruler of his father. It is impossible to see if this division was territorial (as with the Merovingians) or purely a co- regency (as with the later princes of Benevento and Capua). If so, Theodbert's capital was probably Salzburg and the Vita Corbiniani informs that Grimoald had his seat there. References to Theobald and the Thuringii implies perhaps a capital at Regensburg and this leaves Tassilo at Passau. All of this is educated conjecture. Ordinals Some historians have distinguished between a Duke Theodo I, ruling around 680, and a Duke Theodo II, reigning in the early eighth century. Theodo I is associated with events involving Saint Emmeram, Uta and Lantpert, while Theodo II is associated with Saints Corbinian and Rupert, the ecclesiastical organisation and the division of the Duchy. However, no contemporary source indicates a distinction between different Dukes of that name. To complicate matters even further, Bavarian tradition has referred to Theodo I and Theodo II as Theodo IV and Theodo V respectively to differentiate them from legendary Agilolfing ancestors Theodo I to III, all who would have reigned before 550.

The station used to broadcast Catholic religious programming and Catholic themed programming like music shows, and youth programming, as well as local religious programming such as Born Anew, hosted by Sister Sue Jenkins. The station, as well as Kingdom of God Ministries, was founded by Sister Sue Jenkins, a Catholic nun. The station also had a low-power repeater in Kokomo, Indiana, WKGK-LP (channel 50). WKGK's operations became intermittent after losing its transmitter site in December 2004, signing on only to preserve the broadcast license; after last operating on March 14, 2012, the station informed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 4, 2013 that it would not be able to resume operations until April 11, resulting in the WKGK license being canceled on April 17. Kingdom of God is also the licensee of W51DU channel 51, a former Trinity Broadcasting Network repeater in Lafayette, Indiana. TBN took W51DU silent March 25, 2010 due to declining support, which has been attributed to the digital transition. TBN would later sell the station to the Minority Media and Television Council, which in turn would sell the station to Kingdom of God, with the intent of using the translator to repeat programming from WKOG. The station had announced plans to build a new satellite broadcasting center in Indianapolis. It would house a satellite uplink facility, which it would use to launch a new international ministry.

South Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations () refers to international relations between South Korea and the United States. Relations commenced in 1950, when the United States helped establish the modern state of South Korea, also known as the Republic of Korea, and fought on its UN-sponsored side in the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953). During the subsequent four decades, South Korea experienced tremendous economic, political and military growth, and significantly reduced U.S. dependency. South Korea has a long military alliance with the United States, aiding the U.S. in every war since the Vietnam War, and most recently during the Iraq War. At the 2009 G20 London summit, U.S. President Barack Obama called South Korea \\"one of America's closest allies and greatest friends.\\"President Obama Vows Strengthened U.S.-South Korea Ties 2 Apr 2009. Embassy of the United States, Seoul In 1989, South Korea was among the first batch of countries to be designated as a major non-NATO ally. According to academics David Shambaugh and Michael Yahuda, there are currently several security factors shaping the alliance: # The challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile program and the potential of weapons proliferation to other states, # The impact of peace and reunification developments on the Korean peninsula on the strategic relationship between the United States and China # The potential impact of events on the Korean peninsula on Japan and Sino-Japanese rivalry. Relations between the United States and South Korea generally strengthened under conservative, pro-American administrations like Lee Myung-bak. However, with the recent turmoil from the deployment of THAAD, the U.S. pulling out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and on-going cost-sharing disputes in regards to the American bases stationed in the country, the relationship has been strained. The COVID-19 pandemic may also put further strain on relations, as any significant spread would mandate escalation of border controls against American visa holders, as well as comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that he \\"did not like\\" dealing with South Korean President Moon Jae-in while simultaneously calling the South Koreans \\"terrible people\\". However, signs indicate S.K.-U.S. relations may be simultaneously improving, as cultural exchange such as the TALK program, developments in media partnership and a strong trade in goods and services. South Korea is also a top destination of U.S. military hardware, with a recent deal in August 2019 for Seahawk helicopters topping 800 million dollars.

The United States and Korea's Joseon Dynasty established diplomatic relations under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, and the first U.S. diplomatic envoy arrived in Korea in 1883. US-Korea relations continued until 1905, when Japan assumed direction over Korean foreign affairs. In 1910, Japan began a 35-year period of colonial rule over Korea. Following Japan's surrender to the Allies in 1945, at the end of World War II, the Korean Peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel into two occupation zones, with the United States in the South and the Soviet Union in the North. Initial talks in 1945‚Äì6 to achieve a unified, independent Korea were not successful, and in 1948 two separate nations were established - the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the South, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the North. In 1949, the United States established diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea. = Korean War (6.25 War) = Cross- border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel escalated into open warfare when the North Korean forces invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. The Korean War broke out when North Korea invaded South Korea. In response, 16 member countries of the United Nations, including the United States, came to the defense of South Korea. It was the first significant armed conflict of the Cold War with extensive deployment of U.S. and other troops. = Origins of the South Korea‚ÄìUnited States alliance = General Douglas MacArthur and Rhee Syngman, Korea's first President Following the end of World War II, the United States established a bilateral alliance with South Korea instead of establishing a multilateral alliance with South Korea and other East Asian countries. Moreover, the \\"U.S. alliance with South Korea would consequently have three functions. First, it would serve as part of a network of alliances and military installations designed to ring the Soviet threat in the Pacific. Second, it would deter a second North Korean attack, with U.S. ground troops serving as the \\"tripwire\\" guaranteeing U.S. involvement. Third, it would restrain the South from engaging in adventurism.\\" The United States and South Korea are allies under the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty. Under the agreement, U.S. military personnel have maintained a continuous presence on the Korean peninsula.

Kennedy greets General Park Chung-hee, November 1961 South Korea and the United States agreed to a military alliance in 1953.The ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the United States They called it \\"the relationship forged in blood\\".Speeches of U.S. Ambassador, March 20, 2009 ‚Ä¶ One of the first phrases I learned in Korean, I heard in Korean, when people talked about the US-Korea relationship, was ÌòàÎßπÍ¥ÄÍ≥Ñ, \\"the relationship forged in blood.\\" I remember how moved I was by that, by the passion which people used in talking about it. Our relationship, as you all well know, goes further back even than that ‚Ä¶ (March 20, 2009, U.S. Ambassador in the Republic of Korea) In addition, roughly 29,000 United States Forces Korea troops are stationed in South Korea. In 2009, South Korea and the United States pledged to develop the alliance's vision for future defense cooperation.Joint Statement of ROK-US Foreign and Defense Ministers‚Äô Meeting 07-21-2010. The Korea Times Currently, South Korean forces would fall under United States control should the war resume. This war time control is planned to revert to South Korea in 2020. At the request of the United States, President Park Chung-hee sent troops to Vietnam to assist American troops during the Vietnam War, maintaining the second largest contingent of foreign troops after the United States. In exchange, the United States increased military and economic assistance to South Korea. In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun authorized dispatching a small contingent of troops to Iraq at the request of U.S. President George W. Bush. Since 2009, air forces of South Korea and the U.S.A. have conducted annual joint exercises under the name \\"Max Thunder\\". In 2018 the drills began on May 11 and continued until May 17. At a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on 10 July 2018 the government decided not to hold that year's Ulchi drill, scheduled for June 2018. The Government said the decision was made in line with recent political and security improvements on the peninsula and the suspension of South Korea-U.S. joint military exercises. The current South Korean President Moon Jae-in, elected in May 2017, has said he supports the continuation of sanctions against North Korea if it is aimed at bringing North Korea out of its state of isolation and to the negotiating table. He also argued, at the same time, that he was against a \\"sanctions-only\\" approach toward North Korea. His approach to North Korea is similar to Kim Dae-jung's Sunshine Policy, which only continued up to the Roh Mu-hyun's administration. In 2018 there were several rounds of talks regarding sharing the cost of U.S forces in South Korea. These reflect Washington's desire for South Korea to share a \\"greater burden\\" of the costs of the military deployment. On February 10, 2019, South Korea and the United States confirmed that a year long deal for keeping American troops, numbering 28,500, in South Korea had been made. This was in exchanged for South Korea paying 925 million dollars to the United States. South Korea-U.S. relations have also been strengthened over the years from state to state cooperation that has largely remained out of the public purview. An example of this is the American assistance that was discretely given to the South Korean government immediately following the 1983 Rangoon Bombing assassination attempt against President Chun Doo-hwan, which killed 21 people including Chun's Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Commerce. The United States quietly provided military and logistics support to ensure that the surviving delegates and bodies of the deceased were safely returned to Korea. According to Victor Cha, an academic and former Director for Asian Affairs in the White House's National Security Council, a South Korean official recounted to him the sentiment that ‚Äúthis is what only a true ally like the United States was capable of doing, in ways that would never become public but would be remembered.‚Äù Nuclear and missile diplomacy South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, November 1983 Between 1958 and 1991, the United States based a variety of nuclear weapons in South Korea. The number reached a peak of 950 warheads in 1967. Since 1991, when President George H. W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all tactical nuclear weapons based abroad, the Korean peninsula has seen ongoing efforts by the U.S. to negotiate an end to North Korea's own nuclear and missile development. These efforts have been characterized by \\"stalemates, crises and tentative progress.\\" Despite the ongoing tensions, the U.S. has not redeployed nuclear weapons, although one recent press report suggests a majority of South Koreans are in favor of developing their own nuclear weapons. South Korea announced the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile defense system at the end of 2017.  Opinion polls  According to Pew Research Center, 84% of South Koreans have a favorable view towards the United States and Americans (ranked within top 4 among the countries in the world).Opinion of the United States Pew Research CenterSouth Koreans remain strongly pro-American Pew Research Center Also, according to a Korean Gallup poll, South Korea views the U.S. as the most favorable country in the world.\\"ÌïúÍµ≠Ïóê Í∏çÏ†ïÏ†Å ÏòÅÌñ•ÏùÑ ÎØ∏Ïπú Íµ≠Í∞ÄÎäî ÎØ∏Íµ≠ \\" 80.7% (80.7% Korean think US gave most positive influence to Korea) On the political side, the United States supported South Korea after 1945 as a \\"staunch bastion against communism\\", even when the ROK itself was ruled by a US-backed dictatorship. In a March 2011 Gallup Poll, 74% of South Koreans said that they believe that the U.S. influence in the world is favorable, and in a November 2011 Gallup Poll, 57% of South Koreans approved of U.S. leadership, with 22% disapproving.U.S. Leadership Approval Ratings Top China's in Asia Gallup (company) In a 2011 Gallup poll, a 65% favorability rating, the highest rating to date.

Despite the world-wide growth of women's human rights advocacy since the 1990s, and the shift towards foreign workers providing sex services for U.S troops, (particularly women trafficked from the Philippines and the former Soviet Union), prostitution via \\"juicy bars\\" remains an issue near U.S. bases in South Korea. = 1992 Yun Geum-i murder = In 1992, Yun Geum-i, a 26-year- old woman, was brutally killed by a U.S. serviceman, Private Kenneth L. Markle, in Dongducheon. In August 1993, the U.S. government compensated the victim's family with a payment of about US$72,000. Markle was sentenced by a South Korean court to life imprisonment, later reduced to 15 years. Professor Katharine Moon notes that the murder was not unique, and did not spark a national debate about the presence of U.S. forces. However, it did become a \\"call to action\\" for some Koreans, and led to the establishment of the \\"National Campaign for the Eradication of Crimes by U.S. troops.\\" = Environmental degradation = In July 2000, the Eighth U.S. Army apologized for an incident where formaldehyde, a toxic fluid, was released into the Han River in February of that year. In a report released in 2017 detailing spill incidents from 1995 to 2015 at the US garrison in Yongsan, South Korean environmentalist groups expressed concern about the lack of transparency and the possibility of continued water contamination, as well as who would take responsibility for cleanup of the site. = 2008 Beef protests in South Korea = The Government of South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 in response to a case of mad cow disease in Washington state. In 2008, the protests against U.S. beef recalled the student \\"pro-democracy\\" movements of the 1980s. Nevertheless, by 2010 South Korea had become the world's third largest U.S. beef importer. With its strong import growth, South Korea surpassed Japan for the first time to become the largest market for U.S. beef in Asia and in 2016 US beef imports in Korea reached a value of $1 billion.S. Korea becomes world's third largest U.S. beef importer July 16, 2010. People's Daily = Opposition to THAAD = The rollout of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) has been met with domestic opposition in South Korea. The opposition has been on the grounds that the North Korean threat has gone, and on environmental grounds. THAAD was deployed under the regime of ROK President Park Geun-hye. Her opponents accused her of \\"bow[ing] too readily to America's requests.\\" According to South China Morning Post, when Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn visited Seongju to appease the local backlash against THAAD, demonstrators blocked Hwang's buses and pelted him with eggs and water bottles. The progressive People's Party also opposes the deployment. The decision to deploy THAAD in South Korea has been opposed and criticized by China and Russia who have accused the US of \\"destabilizing [the] region.\\" On 30 October 2017, South Korea and China agreed to normalize relations, which had rifted due to THAAD deployment.  Economic relations  South Korea has experienced significant economic growth in the years since the Korean War, sometimes referred to as the Miracle on the Han River. As of 2019, China is the ROK's largest trading partner, leading Japan (2nd) and the United States (3rd). Exports to the United States have fallen from 40 percent in the late 1980s to less than 20 percent in 2002.Noland, M. (2003). The Strategic Importance of US-Korea Economic Relations.

A total of 29 U.S. imports from South Korea have been assessed.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. History San Gabriel Mission High School is a Catholic College Preparatory high school, located on the grounds of the historic fourth mission of California, which was founded in 1771 by the Franciscan Padres. The Claretians began administration of the parish in 1908. The idea for the high school began in the mid-1940s and was the ‚Äúvision of Father J. Nuevo, C.M.F., Mission San Gabriel pastor. With the need for a high school and the support of his parishioners, Father Nuevo had collected a sizable $245,000 toward the realization of the project.‚Äù He was transferred in 1948 and his successor, Father Eugene Herran, C.M.F. ‚Äúonly enjoyed a pastorate for a few months, as his success in dealing with the complexities of the new school building project resulted in his election as General Treasurer of the Claretian Fathers.‚Äù On January 16, 1949, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. San Gabriel Mission High School opened in September 1949 as a co- institutional school, under the direction of the Claretian Fathers and Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose. The freshmen class had 119 girls and boys, temporarily quartered in All Souls Grammar School in nearby Alhambra. In February 1950, the freshmen moved into their new building. The first principals were Father John Schneider, C.M.F. and Sister Mary Redempta Prose, O.P. ‚ÄúThe staff numbered three priests, Fathers Schneider, C.M. F., Leo Mattecheck, C.M.F. and Joseph Anglim, C.F.F. There were three sisters, Sisters Redempta, O.P., Columba Davalos, O.P. and Mary Raymond Carmody, O.P., and two lay teachers ‚Äì Mr. John Hanrahan and Mrs. Leo Ryder.‚Äù In October of that year, ‚ÄúSister Maureen Murphy O.P. joined the sisters‚Äô community as an additional staff member.‚Äù Dedication ceremonies took place on January 14, 1951 with Most Reverend J. Francis McIntyre, Archbishop of Los Angeles, officiating. In 1954, while visiting the high school, he expressed his delight that ‚Äúwhat a few years ago was a dream is now the flourishing San Gabriel Mission High School.‚Äù The new school quickly began to establish its identity by selecting its school colors, selecting green and silver, signifying hope and sterling worth. And, in keeping its connection with Mission's historical tradition, the student body chose ‚ÄúPioneers‚Äù as the school name. In addition, many clubs and activities were organized during these first years: Student Council, Sodality, GAA, Glee club, Orchestra and Drama clubs. The school was alive with many sports‚Äô activities. The boys were able to join football, basketball, track, soccer, golf, bowling and tennis teams. The girls participated in volleyball, basketball, and tennis. Intramural sports, Play Day and Field Day became, and still are, annual events. Dances, rallies, drama and musicals rounded out the activity schedule. San Gabriel Mission High School has had an illustrious history. Throughout the years, the many talents of the students were displayed, whether dramatic plays or light-hearted musicals. The choral voices could be heard beginning in 1950, as Mission students entertained audiences with a ‚ÄúTribute to Stephen Foster.‚Äù For many years, the Drama Club and Glee Club were privileged to present their operetta at the famous San Gabriel Mission Playhouse. Plays performed in the high school auditorium from Bye Bye Birdie in the 70s to Steel Magnolias in the 80s and most recently In Juliet's Garden, at the Grapevine Arbor. 1963, the Mission Band distinguished itself during the parade competition at the Annual Temple City Camellia Parade. And, in that same year the Boys Pioneer Basketball Team were in CIF for the seventh time and the Mission Soccer Team won League Title. Throughout the years, Mission's athletic abilities have been and continue to include CIF performances as well as Horizon League Championships. In 2007, Mission TV went live on the internet and in 2009, the Cultural Room opened, where language clubs host meetings and share diversities.

The nearest point of reference is the \\"Ciudad Empresarial La Negra\\" (La Negra Business City). It lies between the 1309 and 1310 km marker points on the highway. Description The sculpture was constructed by the Chilean sculptor Mario Irarr√°zabal at an altitude of 1,100 meters above sea level. Its exaggerated size is said to emphasize human vulnerability and helplessness. The work has a base of iron and concrete, and stands tall. Funded by Corporaci√≥n Pro Antofagasta, a local booster organization, the sculpture was inaugurated on 28 March 1992. It has since become a point of interest for tourists traveling Route 5, which forms part of the Pan-American Highway. It is an easy victim of graffiti and is therefore cleaned occasionally. To get to the sculpture from Antofagasta, take Route 28 going East until the road joins Route 5 at La Negra (industrial complex) (distance from Route 1 in Antofagasta to the junction at La Negra approximately ). Take Route 5 going South for another , where a dirt road turns right (West) towards the sculpture. The sculpture is from the main road.

For several hundreds of years, the area was the site of intertribal wars of indigenous peoples. Beginning in the 16th century, the arrival of Portuguese explorers led to conflicts with the aboriginal peoples; a notable example being the revolt of the Tamoio Confederation. Sporadic revolts of African slaves also marked the colonial period, with a notable rebellion led by Zumbi dos Palmares. Conflicts were encountered with other European nations as well ‚Äì two notable examples being the France Antarctique affair, and a conflict with the Netherlands in the early 17th century over control of much of the Northeast. Although Portugal retained its possessions during conflicts with other nations, it lost control of the colony after the Brazilian war of Independence, which led to the establishment of the Empire of Brazil. Brazil's history after independence is marked by early territorial wars against its neighboring countries which have greatly affected the formation of current political boundaries. For example, the Cisplatine War, fought over the present day territory of Uruguay established that nation's independence. Brazil was also affected in its infancy by minor ‚Äì and ultimately, unsuccessful ‚Äì revolts in the Northern provinces. An armed conflict with Paraguay led to an establishment of Brazil's current border with that nation after a decisive victory. Internal conflicts between the executive government and the power of wealthy landowners finally led to the abolishment of the Brazilian Empire, and the rise of the current republican government. Modern activity includes participation in both World Wars along with internal struggles due to military rule, and participation in right wing military operations, such as Operation Condor. Recent developments include participation in peacekeeping efforts after the 2004 Haiti rebellion.  European colonization  = Indigenous rebellions = A Tamoio Warrior depicted by Jean-Baptiste Debret in the early 19th century. The Tamoyo Confederation (Confedera√ß√£o dos Tamoios in Portuguese language) was a military alliance of aboriginal chieftains of the sea coast ranging from what is today Santos to Rio de Janeiro, which occurred from 1554 to 1567. The main reason for this rather unusual alliance between separate tribes was to react against slavery and wholesale murder and destruction wrought by the early Portuguese discoverers and colonisers of Brazil onto the Tupinamb√° people. In the Tupi language, \\"Tamuya\\" means \\"elder\\" or \\"grandfather\\". Cunhambebe was elected chief of the Confederation by his counterparts, and together with chiefs Pindobu√ß√∫, Koakira, Arara√≠ and Aimber√™, declared war on the Portuguese. = Slave rebellions = Slave rebellions were frequent until the practice of slavery was abolished in 1888. The most famous of the revolts was led by Zumbi dos Palmares. The state he established, named the Quilombo dos Palmares, was a self-sustaining republic of Maroons escaped from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, and was \\"a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Pernambuco\\".Braudel, 1984. p. 390 At its height, Palmares had a population of over 30,000. Forced to defend against repeated attacks by Portuguese colonial power, the warriors of Palmares were expert in capoeira, a martial arts form developed in Brazil by African slaves in the 16th century. An African known only as Zumbi was born free in Palmares in 1655, but was captured by the Portuguese and given to a missionary, Father Ant√≥nio Melo when he was approximately 6 years old. Baptized Francisco, Zumbi was taught the sacraments, learned Portuguese and Latin, and helped with daily mass. Despite attempts to \\"civilize\\" him, Zumbi escaped in 1670 and, at the age of 15, returned to his birthplace. Zumbi became known for his physical prowess and cunning in battle and was a respected military strategist by the time he was in his early twenties. Capoeira or the Dance of War by Johann Moritz Rugendas, 1835By 1678, the governor of the captaincy of Pernambuco, Pedro Almeida, weary of the longstanding conflict with Palmares, approached its leader Ganga Zumba with an olive branch. Almeida offered freedom for all runaway slaves if Palmares would submit to Portuguese authority, a proposal which Ganga Zumba favored. But Zumbi was distrustful of the Portuguese. Further, he refused to accept freedom for the people of Palmares while other Africans remained enslaved. He rejected Almeida's overture and challenged Ganga Zumba's leadership. Vowing to continue the resistance to Portuguese oppression, Zumbi became the new leader of Palmares. Fifteen years after Zumbi assumed leadership of Palmares, Portuguese military commanders Domingos Jorge Velho and Vieira de Mello mounted an artillery assault on the quilombo. February 6, 1694, after 67 years of ceaseless conflict with the cafuzos, or Maroons, of Palmares, the Portuguese succeeded in destroying Cerca do Macaco, the republic's central settlement. Palmares' warriors were no match for the Portuguese artillery; the republic fell, and Zumbi was wounded. Though he survived and managed to elude the Portuguese, he was betrayed, captured almost two years later and beheaded on the spot November 20, 1695. The Portuguese transported Zumbi's head to Recife, where it was displayed in the central pra√ßa as proof that, contrary to popular legend among African slaves, Zumbi was not immortal. It was also done as a warning of what would happen to others if they tried to be as brave as him. Remnants of the old quilombos continued to reside in the region for another hundred years. = France Antartique affair= = Dutch in the Northeast =  Empire of Brazil  The early history of Brazil was marked by sporadic revolts in the country. = War of Independence = = Confederation of the Equator = = Cisplatine War = = Ragamuffin War = = Platine War = = Uruguayan War = = Paraguayan War= In 1864, the Paraguayan War started mostly due to the expansionist desires of Paraguayan president, Francisco Solano L√≥pez. The start of the war has also been widely attributed to causes as varied as the after-effects of colonialism in Latin America, the struggle for physical power over the strategic River Plate region, Brazilian and Argentinian meddling in internal Uruguayan politics.Miguel Angel Centeno, Blood and Debt: War and the Nation-State in Latin America, University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1957. Page 55. Since Brazil and Argentina had become independent, the fight between the governments of Buenos Aires and of Rio de Janeiro for hegemony in the River Plate basin profoundly marked the diplomatic and political relations between the countries of the region.Whigwham, 118. Brazil almost entered into war with Argentina twice. The government of Buenos Aires intended to reconstruct the territory of the old Viceroyalty of the River Plate, enclosing Paraguay and Uruguay. It carried out diverse attempts to do so during the first half of the 19th century, without success ‚Äî many times due to Brazilian intervention. Fearing excessive Argentine control, Brazil favored a balance of power in the region, helping Paraguay and Uruguay retain their sovereignty. Brazil, under the rule of the Portuguese, was the first country to recognize the independence of Paraguay in 1811. While Argentina was ruled by Juan Manuel Rosas (1829‚Äì1852), a common enemy of both Brazil and Paraguay, Brazil contributed to the improvement of the fortifications and development of the Paraguayan army, sending officials and technical help to Asunci√≥n. As no roads linked the province of Mato Grosso to Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian ships needed to travel through Paraguayan territory, going up the R√≠o Paraguay to arrive at Cuiab√°. Many times, however, Brazil had difficulty obtaining permission to sail from the government in Asunci√≥n. Brazil carried out three political and military interventions in Uruguay ‚Äì in 1851, against Manuel Oribe to fight Argentine influence in the country; in 1855, at the request of the Uruguayan government and Venancio Flores, leader of the Colorados, who were traditionally supported by the Brazilian empire; and in 1864, against Atan√°sio Aguirre. This last intervention would be the fuse of the War of the Triple Alliance. These interventions were aligned to the British desire for the fragmentation of the River Plate region to stop any attempt to monopolize the region's minerals as well as the control of both shores of the River Plate, therefore, controlling the access of all ships going upriver. In April 1864, Brazil sent a diplomatic mission to Uruguay led by Jos√© Ant√¥nio Saraiva to demand payment for the damages caused to gaucho farmers in border conflicts with Uruguayan farmers. The Uruguayan president Atan√°sio Aguirre, of the National Party, refused the Brazilian demands. Solano L√≥pez offered himself as mediator, but was turned down by Brazil. L√≥pez subsequently broke diplomatic relations with Brazil ‚Äî in August 1864 ‚Äî and declared that the occupation of Uruguay by Brazilian troops would be an attack on the equilibrium of the River Plate region. On October 12, Brazilian troops invaded Uruguay. The followers of the Colorado Venancio Flores, who had the support of Argentina, united with the Brazilian troops and deposed Aguirre.Scheina, 314. When attacked by Brazil, the Uruguayan Blancos asked for help from Solano L√≥pez, but Paraguay did not directly come to their ally's aid. Instead, on November 12, 1864, the Paraguayan ship Tacuari captured the Brazilian ship Marqu√™s of Olinda which had sailed up the R√≠o Paraguay to the province of Mato Grosso.Scheina, 313. Paraguay declared war on Brazil on December 13 and on Argentina three months later, on March 18, 1865. Uruguay, already governed by Venancio Flores, aligned itself with Brazil and Argentina. Soldiers of the Brazilian Volunteers for the Fatherland Corps At the beginning of the war, the military force of the Triple Alliance was inferior to that of Paraguay, which included more than 60,000 well-trained men ‚Äì 38,000 of whom were immediately under arms ‚Äì and a naval squadron of 23 vapores and five river-navigating ships, based around the gunboat the Tacuari.Scheina, 315-7. Its artillery included about 400 cannons. The armies of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay were a fraction of the total size of the Paraguayan army. Argentina had approximately 8,500 regular troops and a squadron of four vapores and one goleta. Uruguay entered the war with fewer than 2,000 men and no navy. Many of Brazil's 16,000 troops were initially located in its southern garrisons.Scheina, 318. The Brazilian advantage, though, was in its navy: 42 ships with 239 cannons and about 4,000 well trained crew. A great part of the squadron already met in the River Plate basin, where it had acted, under the Marquis of Tamandar√©, in the intervention against Aguirre. Brazil, however, was unprepared to fight a war. Its army was unorganized. The troops used in the interventions in Uruguay were composed merely of the armed contingents of gaucho politicians and some of the staff of the National Guard. The Brazilian infantry who fought in the War of the Triple Alliance were not professional soldiers but volunteers, the so-called Volunt√°rios da P√°tria. Many were slaves sent by farmers. The cavalry was formed from the National Guard of Rio Grande Do Sul. Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay would sign the Treaty of the Triple Alliance in Buenos Aires on May 1, 1865, allying the three River Plate countries against Paraguay. They named Bartolom√© Mitre, president of Argentina, as supreme commander of the allied troops.Scheina, 319. During the first phase of the war Paraguay took the initiative. The armies of L√≥pez dictated the location of initial battles ‚Äî invading Mato Grosso in the north in December 1864, Rio Grande do Sul in the south in the first months of 1865 and the Argentine province of Corrientes. Two bodies of Paraguayan troops invaded Mato Grosso simultaneously. Due to the numerical superiority of the invaders the province was captured quickly. Five thousand men, transported in ten ships and commanded by the colonel Vicente Barrios, went up the R√≠o Paraguay and attacked the fort of Nova Coimbra. The garrison of 155 men resisted for three days under the command of the lieutenant-colonel Hermenegildo de Albuquerque Porto Carrero, later baron of Fort Coimbra. When the munitions were exhausted the defenders abandoned the fort and withdrew up the river on board the gunship Anhamba√≠ in direction of Corumb√°. After they occupied the empty fort the Paraguayans advanced north taking the cities of Albuquerque and Corumb√° in January 1865. Argentine boy soldier The second Paraguayan column, which was led by Colonel Francisco Isidoro Resqu√≠n and included four thousand men, penetrated a region south of Mato Grosso, and sent a detachment to attack the military frontier of Dourados. The detachment, led by Major Mart√≠n Urbieta, encountered tough resistance on December 29, 1864 from Lieutenant Antonio Jo√£o Ribeiro and his 16 men, who died without yielding. The Paraguayans continued to Nioaque and Miranda, defeating the troops of the colonel Jos√© Dias da Silva. Coxim was taken in April 1865. The Paraguayan forces, despite their victories, did not continue to Cuiab√°, the capital of the province. Augusto Leverger had fortified the camp of Melga√ßo to protect Cuiab√°. The main objective was to distract the attention of the Brazilian government to the north as the war would lead to the south, closer to the River Plate estuary. The invasion of Mato Grosso was a diversionary maneuver. The invasion of Corrientes and of Rio Grande do Sul was the second phase of the Paraguayan offensive. To raise the support of the Uruguayan Blancos, the Paraguayan forces had to travel through Argentine territory. In March 1865, L√≥pez asked the Argentine government's permission for an army of 25,000 men (led by General Wenceslao Robles) to travel through the province of Corrientes. The president ‚Äì Bartolom√© Mitre, an ally of Brazil in the intervention in Uruguay ‚Äì refused. In the March 18, 1865, Paraguay declared war on Argentina. A Paraguayan squadron, coming down the R√≠o Paran√°, imprisoned Argentine ships in the port of Corrientes. Immediately, General Robles's troops took the city. In invading Corrientes, L√≥pez tried to obtain the support of the powerful Argentine caudillo Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, governor of the provinces of Corrientes and Entre R√≠os, and the chief federalist hostile to Mitre and to the government of Buenos Aires. But Urquiza assumed an ambiguous attitude towards the Paraguayan troops‚Äîwhich would advance around 200 kilometers south before ultimately ending the offensive in failure. Along with Robles's troops, a force of 10,000 men under the orders of the lieutenant-colonel Antonio de la Cruz Estigarriba crossed the Argentine border south of Encarnaci√≥n, in May 1865, driving for Rio Grande do Sul. They traveled down R√≠o Uruguay and took the town of S√£o Borja on June 12. Uruguaiana, to the south, was taken on August 5 without any significant resistance. The Brazilian reaction was yet to come. The Brazilian army in their camp at Curuz√∫, September 20, 1866, by C√°ndido L√≥pez Brazil sent an expedition to fight the invaders in Mato Grosso. A column of 2,780 men led by Colonel Manuel Pedro Drago left Uberaba in Minas Gerais in April 1865, and arrived at Coxim in December after a difficult march of more than two thousand kilometers through four provinces. But Paraguay had abandoned Coxim by December. Drago arrived at Miranda in September 1866 ‚Äì and Paraguay had left once again. In January 1867, Colonel Carlos de Morais Camis√£o assumed command of the column, now only 1,680 men, and decided to invade Paraguayan territory, where he penetrated as far as Laguna. The expedition was forced to retreat by the Paraguayan cavalry. Despite the efforts of Colonel Camis√£o's troops and the resistance in the region, which succeeded in liberating Corumb√° in June 1867, Mato Grosso remained under the control of the Paraguayans. They finally withdrew in April 1868, moving their troops to the main theatre of operations, in the south of Paraguay. Communications in the River Plate basin was solely by river; few roads existed. Whoever controlled the rivers would win the war, so the Paraguayan fortifications had been built on the edges of the lower end of R√≠o Paraguay. Artist's conception of the battle of Riachuelo, by Victor Meirelles The naval battle of Riachuelo occurred on June 11, 1865. The Brazilian fleet commanded by Francisco Manoel Barroso da Silva won, destroying the powerful Paraguayan navy and preventing the Paraguayans from permanently occupying Argentine territory. The battle practically decided the outcome of the war in favour of the Triple Alliance, which controlled, from that point on, the rivers of the River Plate basin up to the entrance to Paraguay.Scheina, 320. While L√≥pez ordered the retreat of the forces that occupied Corrientes, the Paraguayan troops that invaded S√£o Borja advanced, taking Itaqui and Uruguaiana. A separate division (3,200 men) that continued towards Uruguay, under the command of the major Pedro Duarte, was defeated by Flores in the bloody battle of Jata√≠ on the banks of the R√≠o Uruguay. The allied troops united under the command of Mitre in the camp of Conc√≥rdia, in the Argentine province of Entre R√≠os, with the field-marshal Manuel Lu√≠s Os√≥rio at the front of the Brazilian troops. Part of the troops, commanded by the lieutenant-general Manuel Marques de Sousa, baron of Porto Alegre, left to reinforce Uruguaiana. The Paraguayans yielded on September 18, 1865. In the subsequent months the Paraguayans were driven out of the cities of Corrientes and San Cosme, the only Argentine territory still in Paraguayan possession. By the end of 1865, the Triple Alliance was on the offensive. Their armies numbered more than 50,000 men and were prepared to invade Paraguay. The invasion of Paraguay followed the course of the R√≠o Paraguay, from the Paso de la Patria. From April 1866 to July 1868, military operations concentrated in the confluence of the rivers Paraguay and Paran√°, where the Paraguayans located their main fortifications. For more than two years, the advance of the invaders was blocked, despite initial Triple Alliance victories. Artist's conception of the battle of Tuyut√≠ (painted 1876‚Äì1885 by C√°ndido L√≥pez) The first stronghold taken was Itapiru. After the battles of the Paso de la Patria and of the Estero Bellaco, the allied forces camped on swamps of Tuyut√≠, where they were attacked. The first battle of Tuyut√≠, won by the allies on May 24, 1866, was the biggest pitched battle in the history of South America. Due to health reasons, in July 1866, Os√≥rio passed the command of the First Corps of the Brazilian army to General Polidoro da Fonseca Quintanilha Jord√£o. At the same time, the Second Corps‚Äî10,000 men‚Äîarrived at the theater of operations, brought from Rio Grande Do Sul by the baron of Porto Alegre. To open the way to Humait√°, the biggest Paraguayan stronghold, Mitre attacked the batteries of Curuzu and Curupaity. Curuzu was taken by surprise by the baron of Porto Alegre, but Curupaity resisted the 20,000 Argentines and Brazilians, led by Mitre and Porto Alegre, with support of the squadron of admiral Tamandar√©. This failure (5,000 men were lost in a few hours) created a command crisis and stopped the advance of the allies. During this phase of the war, many Brazilian servicemen distinguished themselves, amongst them, the heroes of Tuyut√≠: General Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto; Brigadier General Ant√¥nio de Sampaio, protector of the infantry weapons of the Brazilian Army; Lieutenant Colonel Em√≠lio Lu√≠s Mallet, head of the artillery; and even Os√≥rio, head of the cavalry. In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Jo√£o Carlos of Vilagr√£ Cabrita, head of weapons of engineering, died in Itapiru. Assigned on October 10, 1866 to command the Brazilian forces, Marshal Lu√≠s Alves de Lima e Silva, Marquis and, later, Duke of Caxias, arrived in Paraguay in November, finding the Brazilian army practically paralyzed. The contingent of Argentines and Uruguayans, devastated by disease, were cut off from the rest of the allied army. Mitre and Flores returned to their respective countries due to questions of internal politics. Tamandar√© was replaced in command by the Admiral Joaquim Jos√© In√°cio, future Viscount of Inha√∫ma. Os√≥rio organized a 5,000-strong third Corps of the Brazilian army in Rio Grande do Sul. In Mitre's absence, Caxias assumed the general command and restructured the army. Between November 1866 and July 1867, Caxias organized a health corps (to give aid to the endless number of injured soldiers and to fight the epidemic of cholera) and a system of supplying of the troops. In that period military operations were limited to skirmishes with the Paraguayans and to bombarding Curupaity. L√≥pez took advantage of the disorganization of the enemy to reinforce his stronghold in Humait√°. The march to flank the left wing of the Paraguayan fortifications constituted the basis of Caxias's tactics. Caxias wanted to bypass the Paraguayan strongholds, cut the connections between Asunci√≥n and Humait√°, and finally circle the Paraguayans. To this end, Caxias marched to Tuiu-Cu√™. Brazilian officer and soldier But Mitre, who had returned to the command in August 1867, insisted on attacking by the right wing, a strategy that had previously been disastrous in Curupaity. By his order, the Brazilian squadron forced its way past Curupaity but was forced to stop at Humait√°. New splits in the high command arose: Mitre wanted to continue, but the Brazilians instead captured S√£o Solano, Pike and Tayi, isolating Humait√° from Asunci√≥n. In reaction, L√≥pez attacked the rearguard of the allies in Tuiuti, but suffered new defeats. With the removal of Mitre in January 1868, Caxias reassumed the supreme command and decided to bypass Curupaity and Humait√°, carried out with success by the squadron commanded by Captain Delfim Carlos de Carvalho, later Baron of Passagem. Humait√° fell on 25 July after a long siege. En route to Asunci√≥n, Caxias's army went 200 kilometers to Palmas, stopping at the Piquissiri river. There L√≥pez had concentrated 18,000 Paraguayans in a fortified line that exploited the terrain and supported the forts of Angostura and It√°-Ibat√©. Resigned to frontal combat, Caxias ordered the so-called Piquissiri maneuver. While a squadron attacked Angostura, Caxias made the army cross on the right side of the river. He ordered the construction of a road in the swamps of the Chaco, upon which the troops advanced to the northeast. At Villeta, the army crossed the river again, between Asunci√≥n and Piquissiri, behind the fortified Paraguayan line. Instead of it advancing to the capital, already evacuated and bombarded, Caxias went south and attacked the Paraguayans from behind. Caxias had obtained a series of victories in December 1868, when he went back south to take Piquissiri from the rear, capturing Itoror√≥, Ava√≠, Lomas Valentinas and Angostura. On December 24 the three new commanders of the Triple Alliance (Caxias, the Argentine Juan Andr√©s Gelly y Obes, and the Uruguayan Enrique Castro) sent a note to Solano L√≥pez asking for surrender. But L√≥pez turned it down and fled for Cerro Leon. Asunci√≥n was occupied on January 1, 1869 by commands of Colonel Hermes Ernesto da Fonseca, father of the future Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. On the fifth day, Caxias entered in the city with the rest of the army and 13 days later left his command. The son-in-law of the emperor Dom Pedro II, Lu√≠s Filipe Gast√£o de Orl√©ans, Count d'Eu, was nominated to direct the final phase of the military operations in Paraguay. He sought not just a total rout of Paraguay, but also the strengthening of the Brazilian Empire. In August 1869, the Triple Alliance installed a provisional government in Asunci√≥n headed by Paraguayan Cirilo Antonio Rivarola. Solano L√≥pez organized the resistance in the mountain range northeast of Asunci√≥n. At the head of 21,000 men, Count d'Eu led the campaign against the Paraguayan resistance, the Campaign of the Mountain Range, which lasted over a year. The most important battles were the battles of Piribebuy and of Acosta √ëu, in which more than 5,000 Paraguayans died. Two detachments were sent in pursuit of Solano L√≥pez, who was accompanied by 200 men in the forests in the north. On March 1, 1870, the troops of General Jos√© Ant√¥nio Correia da C√¢mara surprised the last Paraguayan camp in Cerro Cor√°, where Solano L√≥pez was fatally injured by a spear as he tried to swim away down the Aquidabanigui stream. His last words were: \\"Muero por mi patria\\" (I die for my homeland). This marks the end of the war of the Triple Alliance. Of the around 123,000 Brazilians that fought in the War of the Triple Alliance, the best estimates say that around 50,000 died. The high rates of mortality, however, were not the result of the armed conflict in itself. Bad food and very bad hygiene caused most of the deaths. Among the Brazilians, two-thirds of the killed died in hospitals and during the march, before facing the enemy. In the beginning of the conflict, most of the Brazilian soldiers came from the north and northeast regions of the country; the changes from a hot to cold climate and the amount of food available to them were abrupt. Drinking the river water was sometimes fatal to entire battalions of Brazilians. Cholera was, perhaps, the main cause of death during the war. A standstill began, and the Brazilian army, which was in complete control of the Paraguayan territory, remained in the country for six years after the final defeat of Paraguay in 1870, only leaving in 1876 in order to ensure the continued existence of Paraguay. During this time, the possibility of an armed conflict with Argentina for control over Paraguay became increasingly real, as Argentina wanted to seize the Chaco region, but was barred by the Brazilian Army. No single overall peace treaty was signed. The post-war border between Paraguay and Argentina was resolved through long negotiations, finalized in a treaty that defined the frontier between the two countries signed on February 3, 1876 and which granted Argentina roughly a third of the area it had intended to incorporate originally. The only region about which no consensus was reached ‚Äî the area between the R√≠o Verde and the main branch of R√≠o Pilcomayo ‚Äî was arbitrated by U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who declared it Paraguayan. (The Paraguayan department Presidente Hayes was named after Hayes due to his arbitration decision.) Brazil signed a separate peace treaty with Paraguay on January 9, 1872, obtaining freedom of navigation on the R√≠o Paraguay. Brazil received the borders it had claimed before the war. The treaty also stipulated a war debt to the imperial government of Brazil that was eventually pardoned in 1943 by Get√∫lio Vargas in reply to a similar Argentine initiative. Brazil paid a high price for victory. The war was financed by the Bank of London, and by Baring Brothers and N M Rothschild & Sons. During the five years of war, Brazilian expenditure reached twice its receipts, causing a financial crisis. In total, Argentina and Brazil annexed about of Paraguayan territory: Argentina took much of the Misiones region and part of the Chaco between the Bermejo and Pilcomayo rivers; Brazil enlarged its Mato Grosso province by claiming territories that had been disputed with Paraguay before the war. Both demanded a large indemnity (which was never paid) and occupied Paraguay until 1876. Meanwhile, the Colorados had gained political control of Uruguay, which they retained until 1958. Slavery was undermined in Brazil as slaves were freed to serve in the war.Hendrik Kraay, Journal of Social History, \\"'The shelter of the uniform': the Brazilian army and runaway slaves, 1800‚Äì1888\\" Spring 1996. The Brazilian army became a new and expressive force in national life. It transformed itself into a strong institution that, with the war, gained tradition and internal cohesion and would take a significant role in the later development of the history of the country. The war took its biggest toll on the Brazilian emperor. The economic depression and the fortification of the army would later play a big role in the deposition of the emperor Dom Pedro II and the republican proclamation in 1889. General Deodoro da Fonseca would become the first Brazilian president. = Fall of Empire =  Modern Brazil  =War of Canudos= The War of Canudos took place at northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, from November, 1896, to October, 1897. The conflict had its origins in the settlement of Canudos, in the semi-arid backlands (\\"sert√£o\\" or \\"caatinga\\", in Portuguese) in the northeast tip of the state (then province) of Bahia. After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, it came to a brutal end in October 1897, when a large Brazilian army force overran the village and killed most of the inhabitants. Some authors, such as Euclides da Cunha (1902) estimated the number of deaths in the War of Canudos as being of ca. 31,000 (25,000 residents and 6,000 attackers) , but the real number was most probably lower (around 15,000, according to Levine, 1995). =Contestado War= The Contestado War (), broadly speaking, was a land war between rebel civilians and the Brazilian state's federal police and military forces. It was fought in a region rich in wood and yerba mate that was contested by the States of Paran√°, Santa Catarina and even Argentina, from October 1912 to August 1916. The war had its casus belli in the social conflicts in the region, the result of local disobediences, particularly regarding the regularization of land ownership on the part of the caboclos. The conflict was permeated by religious fanaticism expressed by the messianism and faith of the rebellious cablocos that they were engaged in a religious war; at the same time, it reflected the dissatisfaction of the population with its material situation. = World War I = Brazil entered World War I on 26 October 1917, as it had found itself increasingly threatened by Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare, culminating on 5 April 1918 with the sinking of the Brazilian ship Parana off the French coast. Brazil's Effort in World War I occurred mainly at Atlantic campaign, with just a symbolic participation in the land warfare.Scheina, Robert L. Latin America's Wars Vol.II: The Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900‚Äì2001. Potomac Books, 2003 Part 4; Ch. 5 ‚Äì World War I and Brazil, 1917‚Äì18 = World War II = During the Second World War, the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, with about 25,300 soldiers, fought in the Allied campaigns in Italy. This participation with the Allies was a contradiction to the quasi-Fascist policies established by Get√∫lio Vargas's Estado Novo campaign. However, with the increasing trade with and diplomatic efforts by the United States and United Kingdom, in 1941 Brazil permitted the US to set up air bases in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, where the city of Natal received part of the U.S. Navy's VP-52 patrol squadron. Also, the U.S. Task Force 3 established itself in Brazil, including a squad equipped to attack submarines and merchant vessels which tried to exchange goods with Japan. Besides being technically neutral, the increasing cooperation with the Allies led the Brazilian government to announce, on 28 January 1942 the decision to sever diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan and Italy. In July 1942, around thirteen Brazilian merchant vessels were sunk by German U-Boats. About one hundred people died as a result of these attacks, most being crew members. At the time, Vargas decided not to take further measures against the Axis in an attempt to avoid an escalation of the conflict involving Brazil. However, in August 1942, one single German submarine, , sank five Brazilian vessels in two days, causing more than six hundred deaths: :*On August 15, the Baependy, travelling from Salvador to Recife was torpedoed at 19:12. Its 215 passengers and 55 crew members were lost. :*At 21:03, the U-507 torpedoed the Araraquara, also going from Salvador towards the north of the country. Of the 142 people on board, 131 died. :*Seven hours after the second attack, the U-507 attacked the An√≠bal Ben√©volo. All 83 passengers died; of a crew of 71, only four survived. :*On August 17, close to the city of Vit√≥ria, the Itagiba was hit at 10:45, and had a death toll of 36. :*Another Brazilian ship, the Arar√° , travelling from Salvador to Santos, stopped to help the crippled Itagiba, but end up being the fifth Brazilian victim of the German ship, with a death toll of 20. The Brazilian population was restless. In the capital Rio de Janeiro, the people started to retaliate against German businesses, such as restaurants. The passive position of the Get√∫lio Vargas government was not enough to calm public opinion. Ultimately, the government found itself with no other choice but to declare war on the Axis on August 22, 1942. The Brazilian 1st Division of the FEB was under the command of 15th Army Group of Field Marshal Harold Alexander (later succeeded by General Mark Clark), via the U.S. Fifth Army of Lieutenant General Mark Clark (later succeeded by Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott) and the U.S. IV Corps of Major General Willis D. Crittenberger. The overall organization of the Allied and German armies in Italy at the time can be found on the Gothic Line order of battle entry. The Brazilian Air Force component was under the command of XXII Tactical Air Command, which was itself under the Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force. The FEB headquarters functioned as an administrative headquarters and link to the Brazilian high command and War Minister General Eurico Gaspar Dutra in Rio de Janeiro. General Mascarenhas de Moraes (later Marshal) was the commander of the FEB with General Zen√≥bio da Costa as commander of the division's three infantry regiments and General Cordeiro de Farias as commander of the divisional artillery. The FEB was organized as a standard American infantry division, complete in all aspects, down to its logistical tail, including postal and banking services. It comprised the 1st, 6th and 11th Infantry Regiments of the Brazilian Army. Each regiment had three battalions, each composed of four companies. Soon after Brazil declared war, it began the mobilization to create an expeditionary force to fight in Europe. This was a giant US-sponsored effort to convert an obsolete army into a modern fighting force. It took two years to properly train the 25,300 troops to join the Allied war effort. In early July 1944, the first five thousand FEB soldiers left Brazil to Europe aboard the USNS General Mann, and disembarked in Naples, where they waited for the US Task Force 45, which they later joined. On late July, two more transports with Brazilian troops reached Italy, with two more following in November and February 1945. The first weeks of the Brazilians in Italy were dedicated to acquiring and training with the new American uniforms, since the Brazilian ones would not suit the Italian climate. The troops moved to Tarquinia, 350 km north of Naples, where Clark's army was based. The FEB was in November 1944 integrated into General Crittenberger's U.S. IV Corps. The first missions of the Brazilians involved reconnaissance operations. The Brazilian troops helped to fill the gap left by several divisions of the Fifth Army and French Expeditionary Corps that left Italy for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. On November 16, the FEB occupied Massarosa. Two days later it also occupied Camaiore and other small towns on the way north. By then the FEB had already conquered Monte Prano, controlled the Serchio valley and the region of Castelnuovo, without any major casualties. The Brazilian soldiers, after that, were directed to the base of the Apennines, where they would spend the next months, facing the harsh winter and the resistance of the Gothic Line. It was in that region that the Brazilian soldiers, together with men of many other nationalities, made one of their main contributions to the war: the Battle of Monte Castello. The combined forces of the FEB and the American 10th Mountain Division were assigned the task of clearing Monte Belvedere of Germans and minefields. The Brazilians suffered from ambushes, machine gun nests, and heavy barrages of mortar fire. On late February, while the battle for Monte Castello was still taking place, elements of the FEB conquered the city of Castelnuovo Rangone and, on March 5, Montese. The German mass retreat had started. In just a few days, Parma and Bologna were taken. After that, the main concern of the Allied forces in Italy was pursuing the enemy. After capturing a large number of Germans in the Battle of Collecchio, the Brazilian forces were preparing to face fierce resistance at the Taro region from what was left of the retreating German army. The German troops were surrounded near Fornovo and forced to surrender. More than sixteen thousand men, including the entire 148th Infantry Division, elements of the 90th Light Infantry Division (Germany), several Italian units and more than a thousand vehicles, surrendered to the Brazilian Forces on April 28. On May 2, the Brazilians reached Turin and met French troops at the border. Meanwhile, on the Alps, the FEB was on the heels of German forces still on the run. On that very day, the news that Hitler was dead put an end to the fighting in Italy, and all German troops surrendered to the Allies in the following hours. Formed on 18 December 1943, the 1¬∫GAVCA (1st Fighter Group) was composed of volunteer Brazilian Air Force (Portuguese: For√ßa A√©rea Brasileira, or FAB) pilots. Its commanding officer was Ten.-Cel.-Av. (Lt. Col. Pilot) Nero Moura. The Group had 350 men, including 43 pilots, and was sent to Panama for combat training, since the pilots already had flying experience ‚Äî one of its pilots, 2¬∫ Ten.-Av. (2nd Lt.) Alberto M. Torres, was the pilot of the PBY-5A Catalina that had sunk , a German U-Boat operating off the coast of Brazil. There 2¬∫ Ten.-Av. Dante Isidoro Gastaldoni was killed in a training accident. On May 11, 1944, the Group was declared operational and became active in the air defense of the Panama Canal Zone. The Group was then sent to the U.S. on June 22 to convert to the Republic P-47D Thunderbolt. The Group departed to Italy on 19 September 1944, arriving at Livorno on 6 October. There it became part of the 350th Fighter Group USAAF, a unit which had been formed on 1 October 1942 in Britain. Several of its first pilots had served previously with the Royal Air Force or the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the Allied landings in Northern Africa (Operation Torch), the 350th FG was transferred to that region and followed the Allied invasion of Italy. Until the arrival of the 1¬∫GAVCA, the 350th FG was made up of three squadrons: 345th Fighter Squadron (\\"Devil Hawk Squadron\\"), 346th FS (\\"Checker Board Squadron\\") and 347th FS (\\"Screaming Red Ass Squadron\\"). When the 1¬∫GAVCA ‚Äî or, rather, the 1st Brazilian Fighter Squadron, 1st BFS ‚Äî was incorporated to the 350th FG, that unit was subordinated to the 62nd Fighter Wing, XXII Tactical Air Command, 12th Air Force USAAF. The call-signs for each of the Groups component squadrons were: 345th FS, \\"Lifetime\\"; 346th FS, \\"Minefield\\"; 347th FS, \\"Midwood\\"; and 1st BFS, \\"Jambock\\" The badge of 1¬∫GAVCA was designed while the Squadron was travelling to Italy aboard the transport ship UST Colombie by a group of its pilots, Ten.-Av. Rui Moreira Lima, Ten.-Av. Jos√© Rebelo Meira de Vasconcelos, Ten.-Av. Lima Mendes and Cap.-Av. Fortunato C. de Oliveira. Drawn by the latter, it can be described as follows, according to its author: : The green-yellow surrounding represents Brazil; : The red field behind the fighting ostrich represents the war skies; : The bottom field ‚Äî white clouds ‚Äî represents the ground to a pilot; : The blue shield charged with the Southern Cross is the common symbol for the Brazilian Armed Forces; : The ostrich represents the Brazilian fighter pilot, whose face is inspired by that of Ten.-Av. Lima Mendes; : The white cap was part of the FAB uniform at the time and distinguished the Brazilian pilots from the other Allied pilots; : The gun being held by the ostrich represents the firepower of the P-47, with its eight .50 in machine guns; : The motto \\"Senta a Pua!\\" is the war cry of 1¬∫GAVCA; : The white streak, at the right, ending on a flak burst, was added later, and represents the danger brought by the German anti-aircraft artillery to the pilots (this device appeared only on replacement aircraft). The use of an ostrich to represent the Brazilian fighter pilots comes from the fact that, during the early Forties, several Brazilian aircrews went to the USA to fly back to Brazil the aircraft then being bought in large numbers by the Brazilian authorities, not only training but also combat aircraft. During their stay in that country, they got acquainted to American food: baked beans, powdered eggs and powdered milk, among other items. The then Cel.-Av. Geraldo Guia de Aquino dubbed the pilots \\"Ostriches\\" and the nickname caught. The war cry \\"Senta a Pua!\\" was a suggestion from Ten.-Av. Rui who had heard it several times from Cap.-Av. Firmino Alves de Araujo while serving at Salvador Air Base; it was used by the latter on his subordinates, inviting them to do their tasks at once and quickly. It became the Brazilian equivalent of the British \\"Tally-Ho\\" and the French \\"√Ä la Chasse!\\". It roughly translates to something like \\"Drill it Deep\\". The Brazilian pilots initially flew from 31 October 1944 as individual elements of flights of the 350th FG US squadrons, at first in affiliation flights and progressively taking part in more dangerous missions. Less than two weeks later, on 11 November, the Group started its own operations, flying from its base at Tarquinia, using its call-sign Jambock. The Group was divided into four flights, Vermelha (Red), Amarela (Yellow), Azul (Blue) and Verde (Green). Each flight had a complement of roughly 12 pilots, these having been flying together since their training spell in Panama. A pilot customarily wore an echarpe in the colours of his flight. The CO of the Group and some officers were not attached to any specific flight. Initially the P-47s were finished in standard US fighter colours, olive-drab (top surfaces) and neutral grey (undersurfaces), except the aircraft of the commanding officer, which was finished in natural metal and olive-drab anti- glare panels. Contrary to common belief, the first aircraft flown by the group's operations officer (coded \\"2\\") was also painted in the OD/NG color- scheme, being lost in action when Lt. Danilo Moura was shot down, being replaced by an overall natural metal finish (NMF) aircraft, which was later also shot down when flown by Lt. Luis Lopes Dornelles and replaced by a third NMF machine. The badge of the Group was painted just after the engine cowling, and the aircraft code (flight letter-aircraft number) was in white letters over the cowling. National insignia was in four positions, this being the US star-and-bar, with the white star replaced by the Brazilian star. Later, replacement aircraft were in natural metal, with olive-drab anti-glare panels, the codes being in black. The Brazilian pilots had been trained in the US for fighter operations ‚Äî but the Luftwaffe had by then nearly no airplanes in Italy. Thus the 1¬∫GAVCA started its fighting career as a fighter-bomber unit, its missions being armed reconnaissance and interdiction, in support of the US 5th Army, to which the Brazilian Expeditionary Force was attached. On 16 April 1945, the U.S. Fifth Army started its offensive along the Po Valley. On this date, the Group was reduced to 25 pilots, some having been killed and others, having been shot down, becoming POWs. Also, some had been relieved from operations on medical grounds due to combat fatigue. The Yellow flight was thus disbanded, its remaining pilots being distributed among the other flights. Each pilot flew on average two missions a day. On 19 April, the German frontline was broken, this having been first signalled to Command HQ by the Group. The Allied forces had to set up bridgehead across the River P√≥, before the German forces crossed it. This was to be done on the 23 April, after a softening up of the German defences by the Air Force on the previous day. On 22 April 1945, the day dawned cold, overcast and foggy. The three flights took off at five-minute intervals starting at 8:30 AM, to attack targets in the San Benedetto region, destroying bridges, barges and motorized vehicles. At 10:00 AM, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of Mantua ‚Äî more than 80 trucks and vehicles were destroyed. Other aircraft attacked fortified German positions, tanks and barges. By the end of the day, the Group had flown 44 individual missions, having destroyed more than a hundred vehicles as well as barges, etc. Two P-47s were damaged and a third was shot down, its pilot, 2¬∫ Ten.-Av. Armando de S. Coelho, being taken prisoner. This was the day when more sorties than ever were made by the Group, and is commemorated each year as the Brazilian Fighter Arm Day. The 1¬∫GAVCA flew a total of 445 missions, 2,550 individual sorties and 5,465 combat flight hours, from 11 November 1944 to 4 May 1945. The XXII Tactical Air Command acknowledged the efficiency of the Group by noting that, between 6 and 29 April 1945, it flew only 5% of the total of missions carried out by all squadrons under its control, but destroyed: * 85% of the ammunition depots, * 36% of the fuel depots, * 28% of the bridges (19% damaged), * 15% of motor vehicles (13% damaged) and * 10% of horse-drawn vehicles (10% damaged). The actions of the 1¬∫GAVCA during the Italian Campaign were even more exalted on 22 April 1986. On that day the Group received, from the Ambassador of the USA to Brazil, together with the Secretary for the USAF, the Presidential Unit Citation (Air Force), given by the US Government. The Brazilian Air Force is proud of the fact that, apart other few USAF units, only the 1¬∫GAVCA and two Royal Australian Air Force units ‚Äî Nos. 2 and 13 Squadrons ‚Äî have received this citation. During eight months of the campaign, the Brazilian Expeditionary Force managed to take 20,573 Axis prisoners (two generals, 892 officers and 19,679 other ranks) and had 443 of its men killed in action. The soldiers buried in the FEB cemetery in Pistoia were later removed to a mausoleum built in Rio de Janeiro. The mausoleum was idealised by Mascarenhas de Moraes (then a Marshal). It was inaugurated on July 24, 1960 and covers an area of 6,850 square meters. = Operation Condor = Timeline *List of wars involving Brazil  See also  *Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil *South American dreadnought race  External links *Military Orders and Medals from Brazil (Portuguese) *First World War *Brazilian Air Force History in WWII (Portuguese) References ","title":"Military history of Brazil"},{"id":"5748284","text":"John Deane Spence (7 December 1920 ‚Äì 4 March 1986) was a British Conservative Party politician.

Life Falkiner was the third son of Richard Falkiner, of Mount Falcon, County Tipperary, Ireland, and was educated at the University of Dublin, from which he graduated in 1852, the same year that he was called to the Irish Bar. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1867Burke's Irish Family Records 1976 p.407 and was appointed as Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1875. The following year he was appointed Recorder of Dublin, a judicial position he held for almost three decades. He became a bencher of King's Inns in 1880 and was knighted in 1896. Falkiner held briefs in many important cases. In 1876 he was appointed recorder of Dublin, on the death of Sir Frederick Shaw, and earned a reputation for humanity. During his early years as recorder he was called upon to decide intricate points in the licensing laws; Maurice Healy remarked that he was reluctant to add to Dublin's licensed premises.Healy, Maurice, The Old Munster Circuit 1939 Mercier Press edition p.239 He took an interest in the subject of workmen's compensation, and when Joseph Chamberlain was engaged in drafting the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897 he adopted several of Falkiner's suggestions. He retired from his office on 22 Jan 1905, when he was made a privy councillor. Falkiner was one of the most prominent members of the general synod of the Church of Ireland, and in the debates of that body, especially on financial questions, he frequently intervened with much effect. He was chancellor to the bishops of Tuam, Clogher, Kilmore, and Derry and Raphoe. He was also chairman of the board of King's Hospital, better known as tho Blue Coat School. Of this school he published in 1906 a history, which is in effect a history of Dublin from the Restoration to the Victorian era. Falkiner pursued literary interests; he wrote on Jonathan Swift's portraits (Swift's Prose Works, 1908, vol. xii.), and a collection of his 'Literary Miscellanies' was published posthumously in 1909. Ulysses Falkiner was notoriously anti- Jewish in his judgements, which was most visible, when he was a judge in a case against Henry Kahn (a Jewish ancestor of the Irish Actress Dervla Kirwan) in 1902. While this caused a public outrage, he ultimately retained his position. In his capacity as Recorder of Dublin (as of 16 June 1904) he is both mentioned and directly appears in James Joyce's Ulysses ‚Äî in Chapter 8 (Lestrygonians), Chapter 12 (Cyclops) and Chapter 15 (Circe). In a hallucination he sentences Leopold Bloom to the same punishment as Kahn - Mountjoy Prison. Following his retirement as Recorder of Dublin in June 1905 he was made a member of the Irish Privy Council. He was also a governor of the King's Hospital school in Dublin. He died in retirement at Funchal, Madeira, on 23 March 1908. Family He married twice: (1) in 1861 Adelaide Matilda (died 1877), third daughter of Thomas Sadleir of Ballinderry Park, county Tipperary ; and (2) Robina Hall (died 1895), third daughter of N. B. M'Intire of Cloverhill, county Dublin. By his first wife he had issue three sons, including Caesar Litton Falkiner, and four daughters.

The battle was part of a larger North Vietnamese military operation known as Campaign 275 to capture the Tay Nguyen region, known in the West as the Vietnamese Central Highlands. In March 1975 the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 4th Corps staged a large-scale offensive, known as Campaign 275, with the aim of capturing the Central Highlands from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in order to kick-start the first stage of the 1975 Spring Offensive. Within ten days, the North Vietnamese destroyed most ARVN military formations in II Corps Tactical Zone, exposing the severe weaknesses of the South Vietnamese military. For South Vietnam, the defeat at Ban Me Thuot and the disastrous evacuation from the Central Highlands came about as a result of two major mistakes. Firstly, in the days leading up to the assault on Ban Me Thuot, ARVN Major General Pham Van Phu repeatedly ignored intelligence which showed the presence of several PAVN divisions around the district.Frank Snepp, p. 43‚Äì51 Secondly, President Nguyen Van Thieu's strategy to withdraw from the Central Highlands was poorly planned and implemented.Le Dai Anh Kiet, p.149 In the end, it was the ordinary South Vietnamese soldiers and their families who paid the ultimate price, as North Vietnamese artillery destroyed much of the South Vietnamese military convoy on Route 7.George C. Herring, p.259 Background At the beginning of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid close attention to the military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the PAVN 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam's III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war.LeGro (1981), p.147 Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities. Following extensive discussions on the fighting ability of the ARVN, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff's plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‚ÄòCampaign 275‚Äô and the goal was to capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, PAVN General VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective.LeGro (1981), p.148 For the element of surprise to be successful, PAVN forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the PAVN would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city. =Order of battle= North Vietnam In March 1975 the PAVN Central Highlands Front, under the command of General Hoang Minh Thao, were given the responsibility of carrying out Campaign 275 to capture key objectives in the Central Highlands. Major General Vu Lang was the deputy commander, Colonel Dang Vu Hiep was appointed the Front's political commissar, and Colonel Phi Trieu Ham was the deputy political commissar. The Central Highlands Front fielded five infantry divisions (3rd ‚ÄòGold Star‚Äô, 10th, 316th, 320A and 968th Infantry Divisions) and four independent regiments (25th, 271st, 95A, and 95B Infantry Regiments). To support the aforementioned units, North Vietnam deployed the 273rd Armoured Regiment, two artillery units (40th and 675th Artillery Regiments), three air-defence units (232nd, 234th, and 593rd Air- Defence Regiments), two combat engineer units (7th and 575th Combat Engineer Regiments), and the 29th Communications Regiment.Nguyen Van Bieu, p.292 Offensive strategy Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, PAVN field commanders in the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their upcoming offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, PAVN commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the PAVN and the strength of the ARVN in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, PAVN commanders concluded that the ARVN in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5‚Äì7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if ARVN units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that the ARVN could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed the ARVN could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.Nguyen Van Bieu, pp.292Hoang Minh Thao, p.153 Aside from dealing with the ARVN formations which South Vietnam might have deployed, the question of where and when to strike was the main problem that concerned the North Vietnamese. After the strength of both armies had been taken into account, the Central Highlands High Command came up with two offensive options. In the first option, the PAVN could avoid the outlying ARVN installations and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first option to be successful, the PAVN had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential ARVN reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, because it would give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot. In the second option, the North Vietnamese had to destroy all the outlying ARVN defences and then move on to Ban Me Thuot. The Central Highlands Front, under General Hoang Minh Thao's command, ordered all combat units to follow the second option and destroy the defences around Ban Me Thuot, but to be ready to switch to the first option when the opportunity presented itself. South Vietnam The 23rd Division under the command of Brigadier General Tran Van Cam was the main unit defending Ban Me Thuot and the surrounding areas. Major General Pham Van Phu had at his disposal five artillery battalions equipped with 146 artillery guns, and one armoured brigade of about 117 tanks and armoured vehicles. The South Vietnamese military also stationed air force and naval units in Ban Me Thuot. The ARVN also had in the Central Highlands the 22nd Division, 7 Ranger battalions, 36 Regional Force battalions, 8 artillery battalions equipped with 230 artillery guns, and 4 armoured brigades. To support those ground units, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) had 32 fighter-bombers, 86 helicopters, and 32 transport and reconnaissance aircraft. Across the Central Highlands, the South Vietnamese military enjoyed a numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers against North Vietnam's 65,141 soldiers. However, within the vicinity of Ban Me Thuot, the South Vietnamese were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North Vietnamese had more tanks, armoured vehicles, and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North Vietnamese General Van Tien Dung believed his tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.Van Tien Dung, p. 19 South Vietnamese preparations On February 18, 1975, President Thi·ªáu gathered all his commanders at the Independence Palace to discuss the Ly Thuong Kiet Military Plan, which was approved by the National Security Council in December 1974. During a briefing by ARVN Colonel Hoang Ngoc Lung, Head of the ARVN General Staff, several important issues were brought to the attention of President Thi·ªáu and the ARVN Corps commanders: firstly, information gathered by the ARVN showed there were seven PAVN divisions in the northern areas of South Vietnam's I Corps Tactical Zone; secondly, there were signs which suggested that the PAVN might launch a large- scale attack during the spring-summer season of 1975; and thirdly, the II Corps Tactical Zone was most likely North Vietnam's first target. On February 19 General Phu returned to Pleiku to draw up a defence plan.Can Van Vien, p. 211 During the next few days, reports from South Vietnamese intelligence showed that the PAVN 968th Infantry Division had arrived in South Vietnam's II Corps from Laos. Two divisions (10th and 320A Infantry Divisions) had taken up positions around Pleiku and Kon Tum, while the PAVN 271st and 202nd Regiments had set up their base in Quang Duc.Duong Hao, p.148 On March 2 a CIA officer flew out from Nha Trang to inform ARVN Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat of PAVN preparations to attack Ban Me Thuot, without offering information on the strength of the PAVN formations. In response to the CIA report, General Phu ordered the 53rd Regiment to move from Quang Duc to Ban Me Thuot and the 45th Regiment from Thuan Man to Thanh An-Don Tham.Frank Snepp, pp.45‚Äì46 General Phu did not make any further changes to the South Vietnamese order of battle in or around Ban Me Thuot. Thus, by the time the North Vietnamese opened fire on Ban Me Thuot, General Phu had simply failed to implement an effective plan to save II Corps.Frank Snepp, p.46 Prelude =Diversions= In February 1975, during the midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a PAVN deserter surrendered to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the soldier revealed the whereabouts of the PAVN units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H‚Äôleo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, PAVN artillery began to shell Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of about two or three PAVN divisions positioned about 20 kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku.Le Dai Anh Kiet, pp. 138 Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool ARVN commanders in the Central Highlands.Nguyen Van Bieu, p.298 Since December 1974, the North Vietnamese prepared for the offensive by conducting raids on various ARVN outposts and broadcasting fake radio messages to keep ARVN commanders guessing about the location of their next assault. While the ARVN units were kept occupied by PAVN diversions, North Vietnamese General Hoang Minh Thao began moving his troops into attacking positions. The PAVN 7th Combat Engineer Regiment was tasked with connecting Route 14 at North Vo Dinh with Highway 19 near Mang Yang Pass, which surpassed the district of Kontum. The PAVN 10th Infantry Division began withdrawing from Duc Lap and only left a small force behind to continue the bombardment of Pleiku, as artillery and tanks units took positions north of Kontum. The 320A Infantry Division deployed a small unit west of Pleiku to apply additional pressure on ARVN positions at La Son, Thanh An, and Don Tam. Elements of the 95th Regiment conducted blocking operations along Highway 19 to stop South Vietnamese reinforcements from reaching their destination. The 198th Special Forces Regiment raided ARVN depots at Pleiku, while the main formation of the 10th and 320A Infantry Divisions marched on Ban Me Thuot.Nguyen Van Bieu, p. 298Hoang Minh Thai, p. 148 Personnel from local Viet Cong units infiltrated Kontum and Pleiku to spread rumours of a ‚Äòbig Communist offensive‚Äô on the aforementioned districts. In response to the rumours, the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment was sent out to sweep the areas near Ban Me Thuot, Thuan Man, and Duc Lap. To maintain the secrecy of their operations, the PAVN ordered the 320A Infantry Division, which had by then set up camp west of Ban Me Thuot, to avoid contact with the ARVN. Upon their arrival from Laos, the 316th Infantry Division received similar orders, and was not allowed to open fire under any circumstances. As the events in South Vietnam's II Corps Tactical Zone were beginning to unfold, intelligence reports from Saigon continued to warn General Phu of an imminent PAVN onslaught on Ban Me Thuot. Despite the numerous warnings which he had received from the CIA and his own military intelligence, General Phu remained convinced that Pleiku would be North Vietnam's next target. =Closing in= On March 3, 1975, Campaign 275 began. The 95A Regiment was the first unit to go into action when they destroyed one South Vietnamese Regional Force battalion and successfully secured a 20-kilometre stretch of Highway 19 connecting Ayun with Pleibon and Phu Yen. Later, elements of the PAVN 3rd Division secured a section of Highway 19 at Thuong An that connected with Bridge no.13 at Dong An Khe, killing a claimed 300 ARVN soldiers.Vietnam People's Army, p. 89 On the night of March 5, the PAVN 25th Regiment ambushed an ARVN convoy at Chi Cuc and cut off Highway 21 west of Ban Me Thuot. To keep all the main roads open, Phu sent reinforcements to defend a section of Highway 19 at the eastern side of Peiku and ordered the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment to march back from Thuan Man to defend Route 14 at southern Pleiku. The ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Vu The Quang, was redeployed from Quang Duc Province to defend Ban Me Thuot. By March 8, the PAVN had completely isolated the II Corps Tactical Zone from the rest of the country. Route 7, which had not been used for a long time due to neglect, was the only road still open.Le Dai Anh Kiet, p. 141 Battle of Ban Me Thuot On March 5 Quang sent one of his battalions to Ban Me Thuot in a convoy of 14 vehicles. They were ambushed by the PAVN 9th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division at Thuan Man. Eight vehicles were destroyed, while two 150mm artillery guns were captured by the PAVN.Vietnam People's Army, p. 94 The remaining seven vehicles had to turn back, and Quang returned to Ban Me Thuot on a helicopter. On March 7 the PAVN 48th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division, captured Chu Se and Thuan Man, and took 121 soldiers prisoner. On March 9 Phu ordered the 21st Ranger Battalion to fly out from Pleiku to support the 53rd Infantry Regiment in their efforts to retake Thuan Man. During the early hours of March 9, as the 21st Ranger Battalion and the 53rd Infantry Regiment were repeatedly beaten back in their attempts to retake Thuan Man, the PAVN 10th Regiment captured Duc Lap and the surrounding areas.Le Dai Anh Kiet, p. 142 At 11 am on March 9, Phu flew out to Ban Me Thuot to assess the military situation with Brigadier General Le Trung Tuong, Colonel Vu The Quang, and Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat. Phu admitted that the situation at Duc Lap was irreversible. The 21st Ranger Battalion was reassigned to the north of Ban Me Thuot, the 2nd Battalion of the 53rd Infantry Regiment was to defend Dac Sac, and when the opportunity arose they would be tasked with retaking Duc Lap. Subsequently, Quang was entrusted with the task of defending Ban Me Thuot. Despite the presence of two PAVN divisions outside Ban Me Thuot, Phu believed the situation outside the district was only a mere diversion attempt, and the real target would be Pleiku. Thus, upon arrival at his Pleiku headquarters, he raised the level of alertness there to 100%. While Phu was waiting for the enemy to assault Pleiku, the PAVN 7th and 575th Combat Engineer Regiments cleared the main roads into Ban Me Thuot to ensure tanks and heavy artillery could be directed at the district without hindrance. By the early hours of March 10, the PAVN was in position to strike at Ban Me Thuot.Frank Snepp, pp. 43‚Äì51 Battle =Fall of Ban Me Thuot= At 2 am on March 10, 1975, the PAVN began their assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. The PAVN 149th and 198th Regiments spearheaded the attack by hitting the Phung Duc Airfield, the district of Mai Hac De, and the headquarters of the ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial PAVN attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the PAVN only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak.Duong Hao, p.156 By 3:30 am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Phung Duc Airfield, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.Nguyen Van Bieu, p.338 While the PAVN sappers quickly penetrated the 44th Regiment base area, which was defended by only rear echelon troops, they met stiff resistance in attacking the 53rd Regiment's base and by dawn had been pushed out of the base with the loss of over 100 dead. The PAVN 5th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment continued their assault on South Vietnamese installations at Mai Hac De district and the headquarters of the ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The 5th Battalion successfully overran the nearby ARVN artillery position and the tactical operations centre. By 5 am all main roads leading into the city of Ban Me Thuot were completely under PAVN control. As the sun rose, the PAVN continued to pound South Vietnamese positions around Ban Me Thuot with heavy artillery to cover the next wave of infantry assaults. During the morning of March 10, PAVN infantry units attacked Ban Me Thuot from different directions along the main roads. The 174th Regiment, with one armoured battalion in support, marched through Chi Lang, Chu Di, and Mai Hac De from the northwest. As the 95B Regiment approached Ban Me Thuot from the northeast, the main formation of the 149th Regiment secured Chu Blom and marched towards Ban Me Thuot from the southeast. The 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 149th Regiment launched an assault on Phung Duc Airfield from the northeast and southwest respectively. At the same time, the 2nd Regiment captured the South Vietnamese installation at Phuoc An.Vietnam People's Army, p.104 In an attempt to halt the PAVN assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 armoured personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but they were forced to turn back by tanks from the PAVN 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment.Pham Ngoc Thach & Ho Khang, p.246 At around 5:30 pm, an ARVN Ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the ARVN 9th Ranger Battalion held off the PAVN 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the RVNAF 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the PAVN 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support.Nguyen Van Bieu, p.304‚Äì305 Earlier in the day, at about 2:30 pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, discovered that the PAVN 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu's order was carried out, elements of the 316th Infantry Division had already been engaged in clashes with the ARVN for more than 10 hours.Hoang Minh Thao, p.198 During the night of March 10, there was a lull in the fighting around Ban Me Thuot. ARVN soldiers consolidated to various points around the headquarters of the 23rd Infantry Division, the Phung Duc Airfield and the radio station. Colonel Quang, in a desperate attempt to save Ban Me Thuot, called on Brigadier General Le Trung Tuong to send reinforcements; none were sent. In the early hours of March 11, the PAVN resumed their assault under continuous bombing runs from RVNAF A-37 Dragonfly bombers. At 7:55 am, the RVNAF, while trying to stop a dozen PAVN tanks from advancing toward their objective, accidentally dropped two bombs on the headquarters of the 23rd Infantry Division. From that point on, the 23rd Infantry Division lost all contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Command Headquarters.Frank Snepp, p.47 At 11 am on March 11, the PAVN 316th Infantry Division established full control over Ban Me Thuot with only Phung Duc Airfield still in ARVN hands, defended by the under-strength ARVN 21st Ranger Battalion and the 53rd Infantry Regiment.Hoang Minh Thao p.197 The PAVN 149th Regiment launched another attack against the 53rd Regiment's positions on 11 March, but were forced back with numerous casualties. =Counterattack= On March 12, all ARVN soldiers who had survived the PAVN assault gathered at the headquarters of the 23rd Infantry Division and Phung Duc Airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the PAVN in the early hours of the day. From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the 23rd Infantry Division and the soldiers who had gathered at the 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Phung Duc airfield. Thieu approved the plan at dawn, and authorised Phu to make full use of three RVNAF units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base and the 4th Air Force Division at C·∫ßn Th∆°).Duong Hao, p.158 From 12‚Äì13 March the ARVN 45th Regiment was dropped by helicopter onto Hill 581, one mile east of Phung Duc, to begin a counterattack to retake Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt which had fallen on 12 March. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at PAVN positions to cover the landings. At 3:10 pm, Phu took off in his Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu radioed the ARVN units at Phung Duc Airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers to hold on to their positions. On the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete the first phase of the operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to have a meeting with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the PAVN 316th Infantry Division.Hoang Minh Thao, p.204 North Vietnamese soldiers pose on top of a captured South Vietnamese UH-1 helicopter at Phung Duc Airfield While the RVNAF was transporting the 23rd Infantry Division to the battlefield, their airbase at Cu Hanh was subjected to artillery bombardment from the PAVN 968th Infantry Division. The PAVN command had anticipated the South Vietnamese military's movements, so they built up their forces in and around Ban Me Thuot to prepare for a South Vietnamese counter-attack.Hoang Minh Thao, p.211 On March 13, the PAVN 24th and 28th Regiments received two companies of armoured vehicles and one artillery battalion, which had begun raining artillery shells on Phuoc An. At dawn on 14 March, the 149th Regiment launched another attack on Phung Duc supported by six tanks, the attack was again beaten back with the loss of one tank. A further attack was scheduled to take place during the afternoon, but some of the supporting infantry failed to arrive on time. The attack took place at sunset and the tanks became disoriented in the fading light and vulnerable to ARVN fire, by midnight the attack was called off. Simultaneously with the attack on Phung Duc, the PAVN 24th Regiment supported by tanks attacked the ARVN 45th Regiment on Hill 581 scattering the 45th Regiment, killing over 200 soldiers and ending the hopes for a counterattack to retake Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt. At 3 am on 16 March the PAVN launched an artillery barrage on the 53rd Regiment base followed by a two pronged assault 90 minutes later by the 66th and 149th Regiments supported by tanks. The PAVN were unable to breach the base's earthen walls and lost two more tanks to rockets and anti-tank defenses. PAVN engineers eventually blasted a path through the defenses and by dawn on 17 March the PAVN had finally penetrated into the base. The 53rd Regiment commander Colonel Vo An and over 100 of his men managed to escape the base and make for ARVN positions at Phuoc An. =Retreat= While battles were raging in and around Ban Me Thuot, South Vietnamese military forces in I Corps Tactical Zone were under pressure by the PAVN 324th and 325th Infantry Divisions. During the period from March 8 to March 13, there were clashes in Truoi in southern Hu·∫ø, Mai Linh, Mo Tau, Thien Phuoc and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. As a result of the immense pressure placed upon I Corps, the ARVN General Staff could not deploy strong units from the region to defend Ban Me Thuot and the rest of II Corps.Phillip B. Davidson, pp.569‚Äì570 On March 11 Thieu convened a meeting with Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the military situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw what was left of his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong Delta region, where most of the nation's population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam's territory, so the military had to be ‚Äòlightened at the top and heavy at the bottom‚Äô.Cao Van Vien, p.132 Starting at 11 am on March 14, Thieu flew out to Cam Ranh for a briefing with General Phu. The events which took place after this briefing would go down as one of the greatest failures in military history.Le Dai anh Kiet, p.149 After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the RVNAF 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the Battle of Mang Yang Pass where the French Mobile Group 100 was destroyed in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the PAVN, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.Duong Hao, p.166 After the briefing Phu immediately returned to his headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy Tat, and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using only word of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local Regional Forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the ARVN taking only enough military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang was responsible for the movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using RVNAF fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.Duong Hao, pp.157‚Äì169 =Disaster on Route 7= Although local commanders in II Corps Tactical Zone tried their best to maintain secrecy, the unusual movement of transport aircraft in Pleiku on March 14 stirred up concern and suspicion amongst soldiers and civilians in the area. On March 15 the concerns of civilians were further heightened when a convoy of transport vehicles belonging to the 6th and 23rd Ranger Battalions headed south from Kontum. On the afternoon of March 15, the withdrawal of ARVN forces began to pick up momentum. The ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion opened the main road which stretched from Pleiku to Phu Tuc. Behind them were various infantry, armoured vehicle, and support units. During the early phases of the operation, Phu was confident that his plan would succeed for two reasons. Firstly, he believed most PAVN units were busy stopping the counter-attack at Phuoc An waged by the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and would not have the time to disrupt the withdrawal. Secondly, if the PAVN 968th Infantry Division near Pleiku was deployed to stop the operation, it would have to overcome the formidable ARVN 25th Ranger Battalion which was tasked with stopping any PAVN attacks.Duong Hao, pp.173‚Äì174Frank Snepp, p.50 Chaos descended on Route 7 as South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians attempted to evacuate from the Central Highlands For PAVN field commanders the withdrawal of South Vietnamese military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, but it was not totally unexpected. What surprised the North Vietnamese the most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, it was not until the evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that the North Vietnamese began to receive information of Saigon's decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8 pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue the South Vietnamese.Hoang Minh Thao, 2004, p.234 The PAVN 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept the South Vietnamese column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, the entire PAVN 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with the PAVN 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4 kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo. During the evening of March 17, General Tat organised a counter-attack against the PAVN 9th Battalion with support from fighter-bombers, tanks and artillery, but his troops were repeatedly beaten back in their attempt to keep the road open.Duong Hao, p.176 By the early hours of March 18, the entire PAVN 64th Regiment had blocked all the routes around Tuna Pass, while the 48th Regiment and elements of the PAVN 968th Infantry Division began closing in on Cheo Reo from three directions. In the afternoon, Phu sent the 25th Ranger Battalion and the 2nd Armoured Cavalry Brigade to reopen Route 7. At the same time the PAVN 675th Artillery Regiment began shelling the main South Vietnamese column in Cheo Reo as three infantry regiments attacked the convoy from all sides. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, all their attempts to organise strong resistance were stifled by the chaos created by PAVN artillery bombardments. At 3 pm, General Tat was ordered to destroy all heavy weaponry so the North Vietnamese could not make use of it. About 30 minutes later, a UH-1 helicopter landed on the grounds of Phu Bon primary school to pick up Tat and flew off to Nha Trang.Le Dai Anh Kiet, p.151 At 9 am on March 19, all ARVN soldiers in the district of Cheo Reo stopped fighting. The 6th Ranger Battalion and the 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron became the only units to arrive at their destination at Cung Son with only light casualties.Duong Hao, p.178 A monument to commemorate the Ban Me Thuot victory erected by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, located in ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk Province Aftermath The loss of Ban Me Thuot and the subsequent evacuation from the Central Highlands cost South Vietnam's II Corps Tactical Zone more than 75% of its combat units‚Äîthe 23rd Infantry Division, the Ranger groups, tanks, armoured cavalry, artillery, and combat engineering units. Overall about 3/4 of all ARVN soldiers were killed, wounded, deserted, or missing. PAVN casualties were light in comparison, with 600 soldiers killed and 2,416 wounded.Pham Ngoc Thach & Ho Khang, p.273 Official Vietnamese history claims that during the eight days of fighting, the PAVN put 28,514 South Vietnamese officers and soldiers out of action; 4,502 were killed in action and 16,822 were captured. The PAVN destroyed 17,183 small arms of various kinds, 79 artillery pieces, and 207 tanks and armoured vehicles; 44 aircraft were shot down and another 110 were damaged.Vietnam People's Army, p.94 Civilians who took part in the evacuation suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the ARVN, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by PAVN artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the RVNAF. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‚Äòconvoy of tears‚Äô. =South Vietnamese mistakes= The collapse of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands came as a result of three major factors. Firstly, during much of the war, President Thieu's confidence in the ARVN's intelligence could not be shaken. However, following the capitulation of Ban Me Thuot, Thieu lost all faith in his own military intelligence agencies, when it became clear that the strength of the PAVN was far greater than what South Vietnamese intelligence agencies had gathered.Frank Snepp, p.48 Consequently, Thieu completely ignored his own military intelligence and the CIA, and made all military decisions by himself without consulting the Joint General Staff. Thus, when Major-General Pham Van Phu requested that Thieu send reinforcements to bolster the strength of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands, Thieu gave him two options: either carry out the President's orders, or be replaced by somebody who was willing to do so. General Phu chose to implement Thieu's orders and evacuated his units from II Corps.Alan Dawson, p.16 The second factor was the inability of ARVN commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of ARVN soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families.Duong Hao, p.179 Unfortunately for the ARVN soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. When North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units. The third factor which led to the quick disintegration of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the ARVN. By 1975, the morale of South Vietnamese soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued to drag on with no end in sight. The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered.Gabriel Kolko, p.389 When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of South Vietnamese military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked South Vietnamese forces on Route 7, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam's existence, the average South Vietnamese soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which had a significant impact on his willingness to fight on. During the First Indochina War (1945 to 1954), both Viet Minh and French forces considered the Central Highlands to be their ‚Äòhome‚Äô, as it was considered the key to domination in Indochina. Both sides recognised that in order to occupy the Central Highlands, they had to possess a sufficient reserve of manpower with which to control the strategic areas within the region. By 1975, the South Vietnamese military could no longer afford to maintain a large strategic reserve.Alan Dawson, p.14 South Vietnamese units in II Corps were overstretched in various locations across the Central Highlands, and could easily be overrun by enemy forces. Although Thieu's decision to abandon the region was made with the aim of saving the military formations of II Corps, the decision nonetheless turned into a death warrant for General Phu's men and their families. The lack of coordination and poor organisation during the withdrawal operation not only led to the destruction of II Corps, but marked the beginning of the end for South Vietnam.

History  At the end of World War II, several Kwans were set up. In the late 1950s, these Kwans united under the name Tae Soo Do. A few years later, the name Taekwondo was adopted for its similarity in name, to Taekkyon (practiced by the Goguryeo, Silla, Baekjae, and Goryeo Dynasties). Lee Nam Suk's teacher Byung In Yoon had founded the \\"YMCA Kwon Bop Bu\\" (Í∂åÎ≤ïÎ¨¥) in 1946. Byung In Yoon had studied Chinese Kung Fu (ch'uan-fa) under the guidance of a Mongolian instructor in Manchuria. Yoon trained karate at university karate club in Japan with Kanken T≈çyama. When he trained Karate in Japan, Japanese karate students pursued the Korean student and beat them up. Yoon Byung-in angered by the Japanese karate students, sprung into action using Chuan-fa. He deflected and evaded the karate students‚Äô strikes and kicks to the point that they gave up and ran back to tell their teacher about what happened. Kanken T≈çyama invited Yoon Byung-in to tell him about the non-karate martial art he used against his students. Yoon Byung-in explained to Toyama about his Chuan-fa education in Manchuria. Toyama appreciated the Chuan-fa background since he (Toyama) had studied Chuan-fa in Taiwan for 7 years, previously. They decided to exchange knowledge; Yoon Byung-in would teach Toyama Kanken Chuan-fa and Toyama Kanken would teach Yoon Byung-in his Shudo- Ryu karate. Yoon later created his art and called as Kwon Bop Kong Soo Do. Unlike other taekwondo kwans, early Chang Moo Kwan was mainly based on Chinese Kung Fu (ch'uan-fa). The early Chang Moo Kwan taught Palgi kwon (which influenced by Bajiquan).history view of taekwondo (Translated) Yoon went missing during the Korean War. His teachings were carried on by his top student Lee Nam Suk, who changed the name of the school to Chang Moo Kwan.  Organization  Today, the official Taekwondo Chang Moo Kwan still exists in Korea as a fraternal friendship club with its office in a youth athletic club in Seoul. The current president of Chang Moo Kwan is Grandmaster Kim Joong Young. Grandmaster Kim is also on the Kukkiwon High Dan Promotion Committee. The official martial arts curriculum of Chang Moo Kwan is the Kukkiwon system. Chang Moo Kwan, like all of the main Kwans, supports the Kukkiwon and the WTF. In the early YMCA Kwon Bup Bu and Chang Moo Kwan, the curriculum consisted of karate and chuan-fa. (McLain, 2009) This was one of two Kwans to have been influenced by Chuan-fa(Kwon Bup), which gave the techniques a smooth yet hard appearance when practiced or demonstrated. Chuan-fa forms from the Chang Moo Kwan included \\"Dan Kwon\\", \\"Doju San\\", \\"Jang Kwon\\", \\"Taijo Kwon\\", and Palgi Kwon\\", among others. Early students practiced a bong hyung (staff form) created by Byung In Yoon himself and another created by Yoon Gwe-Byung (Yoon Kwe-Byung), who was a Shudokan practitioner and became a grandmaster of the Jidokwan.  Name  When translating into English, Chang Moo Kwan can have different meanings. A literal translation is as follows: Chang means to create or develop, Moo translates to martial arts, and Kwan to house.

This style of Tang Soo Do is known for its overall power and emphasis on kicks to the head. Founding The Chung Do Kwan (; \\"Blue Wave School\\") name was first used by Won Kuk Lee. Lee had studied Taekkyon in An Gup DongInterview with Lee, Won Kyuk Accademia Italiana Tang Su Do (a neighborhood in Seoul), karate with Sensei Gichin Funakoshi in Okinawa, and kung fu at centers in Henan and Shanghai in China. Lee earned 4th dan ranking in Shotokan karate. According to Yong Taek Chung (a student of Lee) \\"it is probable that he did practice in secret as a teenager because he told this author that when he first started training he and his first teachers would not exchange names due to possible consequences if someone got caught.\\" Chung Do Kwan was the second oldest of the martial arts schools, or \\"kwans\\", that were established following the Japanese Occupation of Korea, being established shortly after the Song Moo Kwan. Lee trained under Gichin Funakoshi Sensei at Chuo University in Japan. Lee also traveled to China and Okinawa, studying martial arts technique, history, and philosophy. According to Won Kuk Lee interview, the main differences among Korean style Tang Soo Do, Karate, and Kung Fu were in how pressure points were used and attacked.Interview with Lee, Won Kyuk. Accademia Italiana Tang Su Do The belt system of the Chung Do Kwan under Lee was as follows: White (8th-5th Guep), Red (4th-1st Guep) and Black (1st to 7th Dan). Testing occurred every six months and students would jump two guep levels per test (8th to 6th guep for example). The reason for this was that many Koreans at that time were poor and could not afford frequent testings. Taekwondo The name \\"Taekwondo\\" was proposed in 1955 by Choi Hong Hi. It was slow to catch on among other Kwan Heads (Kwan Jang). Two names which were actually the two historical names of Karate, pronounced in the Korean language were being used by the Kwan's. Tang Soo Do (Karate; China Hand Way), which was first used by Chung Do Kwan, was used by the following Kwan's. Tang Soo Do Chung Do Kwan, Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan, Tang Soo Do Song Moo Kwan, Tang Soo Do Oh Do Kwan (ITF root) and Tang Soo Do Jung Do Kwan. The first Kwan to use Kong Soo Do (Karate; Empty Hand Way) was \\"Chosun Yun Moo Kwan Kwonbop Kong Soo Do Bu\\" which later became Jidokwan. Kong So Do was used by the following Kwans. Kong Soo Do Jidokwan, Kong Soo Do Chang Moo Kwan, Kong So Do Han Moo Kwan. Kang Duk Won, also a kwan, used the moniker \\"Moo Do\\" instead of Tang Soo, or Kong Soo. The Oh Do Kwan and Chung Do Kwan adopted the name \\"Taekwondo\\" immediately at Gen. Choi's direction as he was head of both kwans at the time. On August 5, 1965, the name \\"Taekwondo\\" was adopted by all Kwans because that became the official name under the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA). Development The Chung Do Kwan was the first Kwan to open in Korea. Because of his law background, Lee was appointed as a teacher at the Korean Police Academy and many of his early students were police. Later, the President of Korea, Rhee Seung Man, offered Lee the position of Minister of the Interior. However, when Lee politely refused, President Rhee arrested Lee as well as one of his senior students, Duk Sung Son. After being released, Lee and his family emigrated back to Japan immediately prior to the beginning of the Korean War. Before leaving Korea, Lee appointed his senior student, Yoo Ung Jun to succeed him as the Chung Do Kwan Kwan Jang. Yoo instead became a supporter of North Korea and eventually the position went to Duk Sung Son. Son was succeeded as President of the Chung Do Kwan by Uhm Woon Kyu in 1959. Uhm served as the Chung Do Kwan President. Uhm also served as President of Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters). First graduates First generation Chung Do Kwan students include: =Duk Sung Son= =Woon Kyu Uhm= Uhm Woon Kyu was the fourth Chung Do Kwan Kwan Jang, after Lee Won Kuk, YOO Ung Jun and Duk Sung Son. He is also a previous leader of the Chung Do Kwan, as well as the ex-President of the Kukkiwon, succeeding longtime President Kim Un Yong. Uhm's nickname was \\"Sliding Side Kick God,\\" due to his unmatched ability with that technique. Reportedly, he could kick an opponent from ten feet away using it. Uhm helped devise the current rules governing modern Taekwondo free sparring, and is one of the pioneers responsible for the formation of modern Taekwondo. He was also Special Instructor for the South Korean Military. He also played a large part in the formation and development of the Korea Taekwondo Association, the World Taekwondo Federation and the Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters). As one of Lee Won Kuk's original and first students, Uhm remains a link to the earliest days of Taekwondo. As Head of Chung Do Kwan and President of the Kukkiwon, he spent decades ensuring that Kukki Taekwondo retains the power, etiquette, high technique, manners, and Way that makes it one of the world's preeminent martial arts. He was one of the most important Taekwondo figures in Korea, and one of the most important in the history of the Chung Do Kwan. Woon Kyu Uhm passed away on June 10, 2017. =Suh Chong Kang= Kang Suh Chong started his martial arts training in 1938 in Yudo, Su Bahk Do, and later became a student of Tang Soo Do/Kong Soo Do under Lee Won Kuk (Chung Do Kwan Founder) and is a graduate of the first class of Chung Do Kwan Black Belts. In 1953 he founded his own branch of Tae Kwon Do and named it Kuk Mu Kwan. From 1957 to 1969 Kang served as the head instructor of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), formerly known as Korean Military Intelligence Agency, and from 1960 to 1968 he was the commanding instructor for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army. Kang came to the United States in 1969, already an 8th Dan Black Belt, with his family and founded his own Tae Kwon Do academy in Brooklyn, New York. Physically he was known for his power, breaking techniques, and superior knowledge of the Chang Hon Forms. He became the first President of the American Tae Kwon Do Association (ATA) from 1969 to 1978.http://www.tkangtkd.com/history.htm However his name is rarely mentioned in the history of the ATA. Even though Haeng Ung Lee (ATA Co-Founder) was a student of Kang. This is due to the political take over of the ATA by H.U. Lee in 1978. Before his death, Lee Won Kuk promoted Kang Suh Chong to 10th Dan Black Belt. Making him the first of the original Chung Do Kwan Black Belts to receive this honor. Today at age 89 Kang still teaches and is the Chairman of the All American Tae Kwon Do Federation (AATF) and the World Tae Kwon Do Chung Do Kwan Federation. His Tae Kwon Do system continues to grow through the teachings of his 3 sons, all of whom are masters themselves and have their own schools and organizations as well. The Kang Tae Kwon Do System has schools in the New York Metropolitan Area and Puerto Rico. Also, they have established Tae Kwon Do clubs at MIT and Johns Hopkins University. In April 2009, Kang was inducted into the Tae Kwon Do Hall of Fame. =Yong Taek Chung= Yong Taek Chung was born in Seoul, Korea on March 3, 1921. While his family had been highly respected and part of the educated class they lost everything during the Japanese occupation and, like most during that time, struggled for survival. Chung became interested in martial art as a boy but it was illegal at that time to openly teach or learn martial art in Korea. Not until he was a young man, at the age of 19, did Yong Taek Chung begin to train in the art of Tang Soo Do under the instruction of Won Kuk Lee. Sometime later, after martial art training became legal, Yong Taek Chung circulated among the later Chung Do Kwan students and he was to become almost a mythic figure because of his exploits. He was known for his toughness and bravery. Mr. Chung was to remain one of Lee's top students and kept a close relationship with his instructor for the rest of his life. After Won Kuk Lee retired and moved to Japan Mr. Chung soon followed his teacher, settling in Tokyo and opening the first Chung Do Kwan Branch Club outside of Korea. In 1955 the Chung Do Kwan (like all Korean martial arts schools) officially adopted the name \\"Tae Kwon Do\\" for their martial art curriculum and so Master Chung found himself as a major figure in the Tokyo martial arts community serving as president of the All Japan Tae Kwon Do Association. In 1959, while still in Tokyo, Master Chung won the prestigious Tournament of Masters. In 1974 Chung decided to bring his expertise to the Kansas City, Missouri in the United States. During Chung's time in Tokyo as well as in Kansas City he would regularly receive visits from his old instructor, Won Kuk Lee. It was during one of these visits in 1984 that Chung received the rank of 9th Dan. In 1988 Chung retired from teaching, turning his schools over to his students, and moved to Garden Grove, California. But remained active with his students and in retirement Yong Taek Chung spent the next 19 years helping students, instructors, and Masters continue the Chung Do Kwan tradition. Chung died on November 11, 2006, in his home in Fountain Valley, California. =Jhoon Rhee= Jhoon Rhee was a graduate of the Chung Do Kwan. Thus, Chung Do Kwan is often associated with what Rhee originally taught Americans. Rhee introduced Americans to the Oh Do Kwan Hyungs called Chang Hon, which were developed by Choi Hong Hi, Nam Tae Hi, Han Cha Kyo, Kong Young Il, Choi Chang Keun, Kim Bok Man and Park Jung Tae and are still used by the late Choi's ITF today (Cheon-Ji, Dan-Gun, Do-San, Won-Hyo, Yul-Gok, Jung-Geun, Toi-Gye, Hwa-Rang, Chung-Mu, Gwang-Gae). He did this at the urging of Choi, who wanted Taekwondo to establish its own Korean identity, something it couldn't do with Japanese forms. Jhoon Rhee states that he learned the Chang Hon forms from the South Korean Army Field Manual sent to him by Choi Hong Hi. The Chang Hon set of forms are still taught by independent American Taekwondo instructors who came from the Jhoon Rhee lineage. Rhee's 1970‚Äì1971 publication of the Chang Hon forms in a series of 5 separate books through Ohara Publications. Originally the ATA even used the Chang Hon forms until the 1980s, even today there are dozens of private American Taekwondo organizations that trace what they teach, and the forms they use, to a Chung Do Kwan/Chang Hon influence. Such organizations include: ITF, United States Taekwondo Federation (USTF), National Taekwondo Federation of America (NTFA), American Karate and Taekwondo Organization (AKATO), American Karate Black Belt Association (AKBBA), National Progressive Taekwondo Association (NPTA), etc. =Hae Man Park= Park Hae Man began his martial arts career when he saw a demonstration at the Seoul YMCA in 1949. After witnessing that demonstration, he asked his father if he could join the YMCA Kwon Bup Bu under Yoon Byung In. His father approved, and Park spent six months learning under Yoon before the Korean War broke out. Prior to training in the martial arts, Park was active as a gymnast. During the Korean War, Park was assigned to the ROK Army Signal Corps and served in the same unit as Uhm Woon Kyu. After the Korean War, Park studied under Uhm and eventually was promoted to 1st Dan in 1954. He first began teaching at Seoul National University in 1955 before becoming the Chief Taekwondo Instructor for the Presidential Protective Forces at the Bluehouse in 1962. Park taught at the Bluehouse for eighteen years. When Korea, first became a republic, the first President Park Chung Hee ordered 6 of the top martial arts to send their best fighter to be his bodyguard. Grandmaster Park was selected to represent Taekwondo. He was the presidential bodyguard for a long time and stayed at the Blue House (equivalent of the White House as blue is the royal colour of Korea). He is the President of the World Chung Do Kwan Association. This is the oldest school of Taekwondo, which started in 1944 before the official naming of the art. Currently, although Park has retired, he now travels all over the world updating Taekwondo standards. Pak Hae Man has many notable students amongst them, Grandmaster Edward B. Sell, the first non-Korean 9th dan, Grandmaster Brenda J. Sell, the 1st female Chung Do Kwan 9th Dan and 1st 9th Dan American-born Kukkiwon holder, (Frank Massar) of Massar Taekwondo and (Sheamus O'Neill) of World Taekwondo Association, and Grandmaster Manny Sosa President/Founder of the Victory Taekwondo Chung Do Kwan Association. Among others promoted to senior rank by Grandmaster Park Hae Man are Grandmaster Mark Iles (9th Dan) and Grandmaster Andy Davies (9th Dan) of UK Chung Do Kwan and GM Aristides Montalvo Santiago(9th Dan ) from Puerto Rico. =Young Sik Choi= Choi joined the Chung Do Kwan in 1958. He has trained with teachers such as Won Kuk Lee, Duk Sung Son, Yong Taek Chung, and Tae Hi Nam. Choi has won 12 gold medals in regional, national, and international contest. Trained in Taekwondo, Kung-Fu, Kumdo, and Yudo. He became a presidential bodyguard in 1970-1973 also he has taught troops in South Korea and China. In 1976 Choi was invited to the United States by Master Chung, Nak Young. In July 2004 Grandmaster Choi was tested for his 9th Degree Black Belt by Grandmaster Cho and Master Park, Hae Man. This degree was granted by Grandmaster Uhm, Woon Kyu, Head of Kukkiwon Institute and Chung Do Kwan. Grandmaster Choi is the President of T.T.C.A (Traditional Taekwondo Chung Do Kwan Association) which he founded on Jan. 1 1996. =The second generation of Chung Do Kwan students= Hyun Ok Shin - United Chung Do Kwan Association Hae Man Park - Current President of Taekwondo Chung Do Kwan Kyu Seok Lee - Senior VP Asian Tae Kwon Do Union Technique and philosophy Beginning in early times, Chung Do Kwan technique and philosophy centered on mastering basics, developing powerful technique, pinpoint accuracy in application, strong kicking, and deep appreciation for manners and etiquette. Its trademark techniques are the side kick, jumping side kick, and sliding side kick although it practices many other techniques as well‚Äîall in accordance with Chung Do Kwan principles. From the start, Lee Won Kuk wanted his students to be men of honor, only allowed upstanding individuals as his students, and encouraged them to live honorable lives as Chung Do Kwan students. All in an effort to restore the good reputation once held by Korean martial arts and distance itself from the notion of Taekwondo students as troublemakers. Chung Do Kwan philosophy is that Taekwondo is a method of self-defense, self-improvement, and a Way of Life. According to Hae Man Park, Vice-President of Chung Do Kwan (retired), today Chung Do Kwan is a social friendship club that endorses 100% the curriculum of the Kukkiwon system. Park states that Kukkiwon Taekwondo is Chung Do Kwan Taekwondo, and has been developed from the old systems of Chung Do Kwan and the other eight Kwans. * We, as members, train our spirits and bodies according to the strict code. * We, as members, are united in mutual friendship. * We, as members, will comply with regulations and obey instructors. Before students could become members of the Chung Do Kwan, LEE Won Kuk would have the prospective members read the Chung Do Kwan membership oath as well as sign a paper agreeing to abide by the oath. Today, some Chung Do Kwan affiliated schools have their members recite the membership oath before the start of each class and after to end each class. Logo The Chung Do Kwan logo is the Korean Um/Yang symbol containing a clenched fist (symbolizing physical power) holding a scroll (symbolizing scholarliness). In a sense, balance is what Chung Do Kwan students should strive for in life. The two ends of the scroll contain the Korean Hangul characters for \\"Chung Do\\". The Official Chung Do Kwan logos include the Hanja for \\"Blue Wave School\\": . The same logos include the Hanja for Blue Wave on the two ends of the scroll. Today The Chung Do Kwan still exists in Korea and now functions as a fraternal friendship social club which is no longer a martial arts style. It, along with eight other recognized Kwans (Song Moo Kwan, Jidokwan, Chang Moo Kwan, Moo Duk Kwan, Han Moo Kwan, Jung Do Kwan, Kang Duk Won and Oh Do Kwan), formed the basis of the Korea Taekwondo Association, and the Kukkiwon. The Chung Do Kwan still issues Dan and other types of certificates from its world headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. Chung Do Kwan members may also receive Kukkiwon poom and dan certification. Chung Do Kwan forms According to Uhm Woon Kyu, the President of Taekwondo Chung Do Kwan (and former President of Kukkiwon), the Chung Do Kwan today follows the complete curriculum of Kukkiwon. Some of the older Chung Do Kwan based schools practice the original Pyong-Ahn forms which LEE Won Kuk incorporated from Shotokan karate. (The Pyong-Ahn forms originated in Okinawa, where they are called Pinan. In Japan, these forms are called Heian.) Schools tracing their lineage to Duk Sung Son when he founded the World Tae Kwon Do Association in the United States after leaving Korea also practice Kuk Mu forms. Other older Chung do Kwan schools practice the Palgwae forms, a predecessor of the Taegeuk forms. After black belt, practitioners of the Kukkiwon system practice the Yudanja and Kodanja series of black belt Poomsae of the Kukkiwon (Koryo, Kumgang, Taebaek, Pyongwon, Sipjin, Jitae, Cheonkwon, Hansoo, Ilyo). Many Chung Do Kwan schools also practice the Chang Hun tul, even if they are not affiliated with the International Taekwon-Do Federation.

Bus encryption is used primarily in electronic systems that require high security, such as automated teller machines, TV set-top boxes, and secure data communication devices such as two-way digital radios. Bus encryption can also mean encrypted data transmission on a data bus from one processor to another processor. For example, from the CPU to a GPU which does not require input of encrypted instructions. Such bus encryption is used by Windows Vista and newer Microsoft operating systems to protect certificates, BIOS, passwords, and program authenticity. PVP-UAB (Protected Video Path) provides bus encryption of premium video content in PCs as it passes over the PCIe bus to graphics cards Encryption in Microsoft Windows Vista to enforce digital rights management. The need for bus encryption arises when multiple people have access to the internal circuitry of an electronic system, either because they service and repair such systems, stock spare components for the systems, own the system, steal the system, or find a lost or abandoned system. Bus encryption is necessary not only to prevent tampering of encrypted instructions that may be easily discovered on a data bus or during data transmission, but also to prevent discovery of decrypted instructions that may reveal security weaknesses that an intruder can exploit. In TV set-top boxes, it is necessary to download program instructions periodically to customer's units to provide new features and to fix bugs. These new instructions are encrypted before transmission, but must also remain secure on data buses and during execution to prevent the manufacture of unauthorized cable TV boxes. This can be accomplished by secure crypto-processors that read encrypted instructions on the data bus from external data memory, decrypt the instructions in the cryptoprocessor, and execute the instructions in the same cryptoprocessor.

The primary designer was Ron Morrison, whose initial designs were extended and implemented by Fred Brown, Richard Connor, and Al Dearle. Napier88 was ahead of its time in many ways, and was the first robustly implemented language to combine a polymorphic type system with orthogonal persistence. The language was robustly implemented and released to users from both industry and academia; up to 1,000 registered users were recorded in due course. The language, however, was only intended to provide a proof of concept for an experiment in persistent programming; some time after 1989 (the year the first implementation was in fact released) the group's interests moved on and the language was no longer maintained. Its influence lives on in various other systems however; the CORBA type \`ANY\` is distinctly recognisable in Napier88's type \`ANY\`; Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR) uses a similar polymorphic architecture, and Java's parametric types solve some of the same problems of uninstantiated types escaping from their static scope.

It is a non-profit organization. Overview The Richmond Jewish Foundation was established in 1979. Like a community foundation, it is an independent philanthropic organization working in a defined geographic area (in this case Richmond and central Virginia), which, over time, builds up a collection of endowed funds from many donors in the community. The Foundation also provides funding to charitable, educational and religious causes outside of the region, including but not limited to Jewish causes. It provides services to the community and its donors, makes grants and undertakes community leadership and partnership activities to address a wide variety of needs in its service area. By 2006, the Richmond Jewish Foundation had over 200 subcomponents that include endowments, donor-advised funds and life income gifts that include charitable remainder trusts. Affiliated agencies include Beth Sholom Campus and Weinstein Jewish Community Center, Jewish Community Federation of Richmond, Richmond area Jewish congregations such as Temple Beth El and Congregation Kol Emes, museums like Virginia Holocaust Museum and Congregation Beth Ahabah Museum and Archives, schools like Rudlin Torah Academy and programs like Hillel. A broadly representative volunteer board serves to oversee the organization and to function as its ambassadors with various constituencies including individuals, families, agencies, congregations and the general community. As a mission-focused independent charity, partnering in community, Richmond Jewish Foundation operates in a manner similar to such charities as the San Diego Jewish Community Foundation and the Jewish Community Foundation of Kansas City and Tidewater Jewish Foundation.

He graduated in with a degree in management science. Since college, he has spent his entire career in professional baseball management from front office executive to scouting. His first major league job was working in the ticket department of the Texas Rangers. He later became a scout and assistant GM of the Rangers (1984‚Äì94). When businessman Bob Castellini purchased majority ownership of the Reds, he hired Krivsky as general manager. The most prominent transactions Krivsky made were the acquisition of Boston right-handed pitcher Bronson Arroyo for outfielder Wily Mo Pe√±a. Arroyo made the All-Star team his first year in Cincinnati. Another significant Krivsky trade brought Cleveland Indians infielder Brandon Phillips to the Reds for a player to be named later. Phillips has been a Gold Glove winner at Second Base and was an All Star in 2010. The most controversial trade of Krivsky's tenure was on July 13, 2006, and sent outfielder Austin Kearns, shortstop Felipe L√≥pez, and right-hander Ryan Wagner to the Washington Nationals for right-hander Gary Majewski, left-hander Bill Bray, shortstop Royce Clayton and minor-leaguers Brendan Harris and Daryl Thompson.

He was placed on the 15-day Disabled list and the Reds filed a grievance; however, the league did not act upon it and was later dropped by the Reds after Walt Jocketty took over as general manager. On April 23, 2008, 21 games into the season, Krivsky was fired as general manager and replaced by Walt Jocketty. In June 2008 Krivsky was hired by the New York Mets as a Major League Scout. In November 2008 the Orioles hired him as Special Assistant to the President of Baseball Operations. His duties included scouting, contracts and other administration responsibilities. He played a key role in the trade of catcher Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez to Krivsky's former team, the Reds, in return for utility player Ryan Freel.Baltimore Sun - Orioles executive Krivsky leaves for position with Mets I In November 2009 the Mets hired Krivsky as Special Assistant to the President of Baseball Operations.

The film was shot in black and white on Super 16mm. After being hailed by critics it was blown up to 35mm for theatrical distribution. Many well known Irish faces made cameo appearances and some commentators regard the 2004 American film, The Perfect Score, as a remake. Plot Upon being caught cheating in his Leaving Certificate exam and being banned from sitting the exam for another three years, a young man commits suicide. A close friend of his subsequently plots to cheat in his own Leaving Certificate in order to get revenge against the system. With the help of a rag-tag group of friends this young man organizes a complex scheme to steal copies of the test papers from the Department of Education and, upon winning, show the world he has beaten the system. Controversy A few weeks before the film went on general release in Ireland, the Junior Minister for Education, Willie O'Dea, condemned the film, leading to widespread coverage in newspapers, television, and radio. In part, anxiety was due to the timing of the film's release, which occurred a few months before the annual summer exams. Other projects by Graham Jones such as Fudge 44 and Traveller Wedding have also caused controversy. Music I Hear You Breathing In from Eleanor McEvoy's debut album, Eleanor McEvoy and Parachute by Something Happens are some of the tracks featured in the film.

Yul Brynner, who reprises his role as Chris Adams, is the sole returning cast member from the original film, while Robert Fuller, Juli√°n Mateos and Elisa Mont√©s replace Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz and Rosenda Monteros as Vinn Tanner, Chico and Petra respectively. The film was written by Larry Cohen and directed by Burt Kennedy, and features Warren Oates, Claude Akins, Jordan Christopher and Virgilio Teixeira. Emilio Fern√°ndez is the villain. Fernando Rey portrays a priest. Rey was in the next film, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, as a different character. Plot Fifty gunmen force all of the men in a small Mexican village to ride off with them into the desert. Among the captured farmers is Chico, who years before was one of seven hired gunslingers responsible for ridding the village of a tyrannical bandit, Calvera. Chico's wife, Petra, seeks out the only other members of the band to survive: Chris and Vin. She begs them to save the village once more. To replace the deceased members of the group, Chris buys the release of Frank (a taciturn gunman) and Luis (a famous bandit), held in the local jail and recruits Colbee, a ladies' man and deadly gunman, and Manuel, a young cockfighter. The six men discover that the missing villagers are being used as slave labor to rebuild a desert village and church as a memorial to the dead sons of wealthy rancher Lorca. In a surprise attack, the six gunmen force Lorca's men to leave, and prepare for a counterattack with Chico. The cowed farmers offer no assistance, but the seven defenders successfully repulse Lorca's initial attack. Lorca, the rancher, then gathers all of the men on his land to rout the seven men. The situation seems bleak until Manuel discovers a supply of dynamite which the seven use in a counteroffensive. They are eventually overrun, but Chris emerges victorious from a shootout with Lorca. The rancher's gang flee, leaving Frank, Luis, and Manuel dead in the fighting. Chico plans to resettle the village on Lorca's fertile land, and Colbee remains to help teach the villagers how to defend themselves against future attacks; he also plans to pursue the available women. Chris and Vin once more ride off together.

Over a sequence of many subsequent papers, this was eventually improved to linearly many steps (O(n/log n) processors), on the most restrictive model of synchronous shared-memory parallel computation, the exclusive read exclusive write PRAM (; ;). This number of steps matches the sequential algorithm. Related problems List ranking can equivalently be viewed as performing a prefix sum operation on the given list, in which the values to be summed are all equal to one. The list ranking problem can be used to solve many problems on trees via an Euler tour technique, in which one forms a linked list that includes two copies of each edge of the tree, one in each direction, places the nodes of this list into an ordered array using list ranking, and then performs prefix sum computations on the ordered array . For instance, the height of each node in the tree may be computed by an algorithm of this type in which the prefix sum adds 1 for each downward edge and subtracts 1 for each upward edge.

DataReaders provide a very efficient way to access data, and can be thought of as a Firehose cursor from ASP Classic, except that no server-side cursor is used. A DataReader parses a Tabular Data Stream from Microsoft SQL Server, and other methods of retrieving data from other sources. A DataReader is usually accompanied by a Command object that contains the query, optionally any parameters, and the connection object to run the query on. DataReader types There is no DataReader class in ADO.NET, but there are a number of classes that implement the IDataReader interface: DataReaders have a small footprint and good performance because each is tailor-made to the task at hand, however this makes it more difficult to write an application that can be moved from one backend data source to another. Some provider-specific DataReaders expose types used by the underlying database - for example, values can be null in Microsoft SQL Server, but not in the .NET Framework prior to version 2.0. Strong vs weak typing When using a DataReader to retrieve data, the developer can choose to read field values in strongly typed manner ( example: ) or a weakly typed manner, returning then as s ( example: ). Both approaches have their pros and cons. Using the strongly typed retrieval methods can be more cumbersome, especially without specific knowledge of the underlying data. Numeric values in the database can translate to several .NET types: , or . Trying to retrieve a value using the wrong type results in an exception being thrown, which stops code from running further, and slows the application down. This is also true when you use the right type, but encounter a value ( this can be avoided by using the boolean function of the DataReader class ). The benefit to this retrieval method is that data validation is performed sooner, improving the probability of data correction being possible. Weakly typed data retrieval allows for quick code writing, and allows for the data to be used in some fashion when the developer doesn't know beforehand what types will be returned. Further, with some effort, the programmer can extract the value into a variable of the proper type by using the or methods of the DataReader. Common errors A DataReader can in some cases be used in place of a DataTable, however many programmers have experienced connection bloat when following this approach. A DataReader can only be used against an (already) open database connection; that connection isn't closed until the DataReader's method is called. If an exception is thrown while the data is being processed, for example as described in Strong and weak typing, above, the method will never be called if the developer writes code explicitly declaring and disposing the DataReader without the use of a - block. The C# construct is a good way to avoid this problem, as shown below in the code example. Sample code Sample of accessing SQL Data using DataReader void DataTest() { using (SqlConnection conn1 = new SqlConnection(...)) { conn1.Open(); SqlCommand mycommand = new SqlCommand(\\"select * from someTable\\", conn1); using (SqlDataReader myreader = mycommand.ExecuteReader()) { if (myreader != null) while (myreader.Read()) Console.WriteLine(myreader.GetValue(0).ToString() + \\":\\" + myreader.GetTypeName(0)); } mycommand.Dispose(); } } using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Data.Odbc; using MySql.Data.MySqlClient; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { string Conn = \\"Server=localhost;Uid=root;Pwd=thiru;Database=Employee\\"; MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection conn = new MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection(Conn); MySqlCommand comm = new MySqlCommand(\\"select * from emp\\", conn); conn.Open(); //IAsyncResult a; MySqlDataReader Ada = comm.ExecuteReader(); while (Ada.Read()) { Console.WriteLine(Ada[0]); } } } } References SQL data access ADO.NET Data Access technologies Microsoft application programming interfaces ","title":"DataReader"},{"id":"5748737","text":"Fudge 44 is a 2005 film from Irish director Graham Jones.

It was written by the financial journalist Andrew Tobias who became famous for his earlier book The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need. It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire insurance‚Äîthe types consumers normally buy. Because insurers are frequently the victims of insurance fraud, insurance companies need to be on their guard. In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could, in theory, make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid claims in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were invalid. This makes dealings with insurers difficult. This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.

History The original promoters of Universe (Paul Shurey, Rob Vega, former Bath Rugby Captain Roger Spurrell, Tennant and Jill Trick) had been organising events since the heady days of 1989 when raves such as Sunrise, Raindance and Perception were in their pomp. They wanted to organise an event to bring together the different sub-cultures of the dance world and also to have a festival feel to it. The first Tribal Gathering took place Friday 30 April 1993 at Lower Pertwood Farm nearWarminster, Wiltshire. 25,000 attended to see acts such as Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Slipmatt, DiY Sound System and Pete Tong. In March 1994 they opened the legendary London night club 'Final Frontier', at Club UK in Wandsworth. Weekly nights ran for several years, relocating in 1997 to the Complex Club in Islington. Each week featured numerous headline djs and live acts, the likes of which had never been seen before. A proud moment for the promoters was when 'Final Frontier' was voted number 5 in Musik Magazines top 50 clubs of all time, just behind Studio 54, Dorian Gray, Paradise Garage and Limelight. Also in 1993 the Universe - World Techno Tribe compilation CD was released in Europe on Rising High Records, on Sony Music in Japan and Moonshine Music in the USA. Compiled and mixed by Mr Oz it reached number 4 in the Gallup album charts. Subsequent CDs were later released on MMS records and FFRR. The Criminal Justice Bill of 1994 discouraged massive outdoor raves. In 1994 Tribal Gathering moved to Munich, Germany and in cooperation with \\"N.A.S.A/ Hannover Nice And Safe Attitude\\" staged an event there. In the UK, Tribal Gathering teamed up with the Mean Fiddler organisation to organise more legal festivals. The next event took place in May 1995, at Otmoor Park, Beckley, Oxfordshire. Headline acts included The Prodigy, Orbital and Moby. The 1996 version of the Tribal Gathering took place in June at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire with 30,000 turning up to see sets by Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, Black Grape, Goldie, Daft Punk and others. In 1997, at Luton Hoo, Kraftwerk were the headliners of the festival, playing for the first time in the UK since 1992.2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering (May 25, 1997). Retrieved on February 7, 2007. The show was a monumental success, even though there was no new material released since The Mix. By 1998, the Tribal Gathering name had grown into a brand. There were albums, a TV show and plans to establish events worldwide in the pipeline. However their things did not go to schedule and the 1998 event did not take place due to Universe and Mean Fiddler's legal battle over the Tribal Gathering name. In 1999 David Vincent bought the Tribal Gathering name from Paul Shurey and Ian Jenkinson, with the aim of bringing the event back to life. The Tribal Gathering name was revived in 2000 at the legendary Sankeys Soap club, Manchester. The weekly legendary \\"Tribal Sessions\\" club night took place at Sankeys with DJs generally playing House, Techno, Tech-house, Acid House & Breaks & Beats. Tribal Sessions djs included Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Cox, Sasha, Steve Lawler, Laurent Garnier and many others. Tribal Sessions won many awards from Mixmag best club of the year 2004. There was also 2 exhibitions in Manchester Museum of Science and Industry for the brand for providing significant culture for the city of Manchester. In 2002 Tribal Gathering returned as a weekender at Southport Pontins to a sell-out 5,000 capacity crowd with DJs Sasha, Dave Clarke, Deep Dish, Derrick Carter, Erol Alkan amongst others performing with many rave reviews. There was a follow up event in November 2003. In 2003 Tribal Gathering held the first legal warehouse party for over 10 years in a \\"secret\\" Manchester location, which turned out to be a warehouse previously used as a set for the movie 24 Hour Party People, which was decorated to replicate The Ha√ßienda nightclub. 12,000 people attended where artistes like Groove Armada, Laurent Garnier, Jeff Mills, Deep Dish appeared. The event won best event of the year 2003 with Mixmag and was voted second best party ever by Mixmag in 2004. In 2004 Tribal Gathering held a two-day warehouse party in a Manchester City Centre in association with the Hacienda with DJs Groove Armada, Graeme Park and Mike Pickering. In July 2005, a Tribal Gathering festival was organised, in aid of the war victims in Darfur, Sudan, to take place again at Luton Hoo but it was cancelled due to the terrorist attacks that took place on 7 July in London. There has not been an event since.

Location The village is equidistant between the cities of Carcassonne and Narbonne in the shadow of the Black Mountains and surrounded by vineyards. A rural paradise, the village remains undiscovered by many from outside the region. Winemaking The production of wine has gone on in this area of France for centuries, and the village is surrounded by a fantastic vista of grape vines which positively glow in the extraordinary golden light for which this region is famed. Castelnau is gifted with a fine winemaking family, Roland and Anne-Marie Coustal, who make wine under the name Terres Georges. The moderate scale of production allows the entire process to be undertaken by hand. Many of the wines from this cave have won awards at the major European French wine festivals. The cave is open to the public for tasting sessions with the winemakers on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Population Facilities For a village of its size, the community is relatively well equipped. Castelnau has some basic facilities including a Mayors office, small Post-office, shop, rugby field, petanque pitch, tennis courts and a beautiful small church.

In Tibet, monks who had completed their geshe studies would be invited to join Gyuto or Gyume, another tantric institution, to receive a firm grounding in vajrayana practice. Both of these monasteries used to be in Lhasa, Tibet, but they have been re- established in India. At the time of the Chinese invasion in 1950, about 1000 monks were part of the monastery. On 21 March 1959, soon after the 14th Dalai Lama had left Lhasa for exile in India, Ramoche was a focus of military operations by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. \\"One especially valuable memoir is provided by the Fifth Yulo Rinpoche, a monk at Gyuto Upper Tantric College and organizer of defense of Ramoche Temple, who says that 'the Chinese Communists shot Tibetans indiscriminately, whether they had taken part in the resistance or not, and ambushed and killed many Tibetans who ran to Ngabo's house for sanctuary.' Another witness, Jampa Tenzin, has stated in a personal interview that he saw fleeing beggars and children slain near Ramoche Temple, a report corroborated in other Tibetan memoirs.\\" 60 Gyuto monks fled to India in 1959. After initially gathering in Dalhousie, India, the monastery was established in Tenzing Gang, in Arunachal Pradesh, India. The main monastery is now based in Sidhbari, near Dharamsala, India. Today, there are nearly 500 monks in the entire order. Ramoche Temple in Lhasa was located inside Gyuto Monastery. The Gyuto monks are known for their tradition of overtone singing, also described as \\"chordal chanting\\" which is said to have been transmitted by their founder. It achieved renown in the West following the release of recordings made by David Lewiston in 1974 and in 1986 by Windham Hill Records.

If the finite projective plane has order q (there are q+1 points on any line), then for a maximal arc, k, the number of points of the arc, is the maximum possible (= qd + d - q) with the property that no d+1 points of the arc lie on the same line. Definition Let \\\\pi be a finite projective plane of order q (not necessarily desarguesian). Maximal arcs of degree d ( 2 ‚â§ d ‚â§ q- 1) are (k,d)-arcs in \\\\pi, where k is maximal with respect to the parameter d, in other words, k = qd + d - q. Equivalently, one can define maximal arcs of degree d in \\\\pi as non-empty sets of points K such that every line intersects the set either in 0 or d points. Some authors permit the degree of a maximal arc to be 1, q or even q+ 1. Letting K be a maximal (k, d)-arc in a projective plane of order q, if * d = 1, K is a point of the plane, * d = q, K is the complement of a line (an affine plane of order q), and * d = q + 1, K is the entire projective plane. All of these cases are considered to be trivial examples of maximal arcs, existing in any type of projective plane for any value of q. When 2 ‚â§ d ‚â§ q- 1, the maximal arc is called non-trivial, and the definition given above and the properties listed below all refer to non-trivial maximal arcs. Properties * The number of lines through a fixed point p, not on a maximal arc K, intersecting K in d points, equals (q+1)-\\\\frac{q}{d}. Thus, d divides q. * In the special case of d = 2, maximal arcs are known as hyperovals which can only exist if q is even. * An arc K having one fewer point than a maximal arc can always be uniquely extended to a maximal arc by adding to K the point at which all the lines meeting K in d - 1 points meet. * In PG(2,q) with q odd, no non-trivial maximal arcs exist. * In PG(2,2h), maximal arcs for every degree 2t, 1 ‚â§ t ‚â§ h exist. Partial geometries One can construct partial geometries, derived from maximal arcs: * Let K be a maximal arc with degree d. Consider the incidence structure S(K)=(P,B,I), where P contains all points of the projective plane not on K, B contains all line of the projective plane intersecting K in d points, and the incidence I is the natural inclusion. This is a partial geometry : pg(q-d,q-\\\\frac{q}{d},q-\\\\frac{q}{d}-d+1). * Consider the space PG(3,2^h) (h\\\\geq 1) and let K a maximal arc of degree d=2^s (1\\\\leq s\\\\leq m) in a two-dimensional subspace \\\\pi.

Introduced as a part of a package of \\"lawful access\\" proposals, Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act (MITA) if passed, would have required telephone and internet service providers to design, create and maintain interception capabilities into existing networks and into new technologies as they are introduced into Canada. Second, it would have allowed law enforcement to compel telephone and internet service providers to disclose subscriber information without a warrant. The bill failed to pass into law when Parliament was dissolved on November 28, 2005. Lawful access legislation was, however, was re-introduced under the name Bill C-13 (short titled Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act) by Stephen Harper's Conservative government on November 20, 2013 and it passed through all legislative stages to receive royal assent on December 9, 2014. Background Under the Criminal Code, \\"lawful access\\" provisions for the interception of communications by law enforcement was first adopted in 1974. The Criminal Code was amended in the 1980s and again in the 1990s to allow law enforcement the ability to search and seize computer systems. In 1984 the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act was passed by Parliament giving law enforcement the right to lawfully intercept private communication in defense of national security. Supporters of Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act and other \\"lawful access\\" legislation, being proposed to date, believe the passage of these bills will amend current provision for \\"lawful access\\" in existing legislation like the Criminal Code and Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act and support law enforcement to lawfully access transmission data from new technologies such as smartphones. Concerns raised include: * Creation of new surveillance powers while reducing the level of privacy protection and oversight associated with that surveillance. * Increased burden to ISPs who would be required to retain traffic data for significant periods of time. The dissolution of Parliament on November 28, 2005 ended all bills introduced during the 38th Parliament by the, then Liberals government, including Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act, Bill C-74. Anticipating passing of this bill, however, ISPs such as Bell Sympatico have modified their various policies and agreements to contain language to the effect that they may monitor, investigate, and disclose information to satisfy laws, regulations, or government requests. On April 4, 2006, the Prime Minister's Throne Speech did not mention bill, which fueled speculation that bill had become a low priority for Harper government. However, the Harper government would later introduce its own legislation to modernize lawful access. Reintroduction of Bill Liberal MP Marlene Jennings re-introduced Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act as a Private Member‚Äôs Bill, Bill C-416 in March 2007 and again in February 2009, as a Private Member\`s Bill, Bill C-285. In both instances, Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act only received one reading before new elections were called, ending the review process of the bill. Related Legislation During the 40th Parliament, 3rd Session, a series of lawful access bills were introduced by the Harper Government: * C-50: Improving Access to Investigative Tools for Serious Crimes ActParliament of Canada.

It was previously known as Fox Kids, then Jetix. There are several variations of the channel which broadcast simultaneously in seven languages (using DVB audio technology): Romanian, English, Bulgarian, Czech, and Hungarian. Advertising is shown in Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Czech. History * February, 1999 - Fox Kids launches in Romania, Moldova, Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria. * November 2000 - Fox Kids launches in Hungary. * February 2001 - Fox Kids Hungarian feed was expanded to Czechia and Slovakia. * January 1, 2005 - Fox Kids is rebranded as Jetix. On August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting a block of \\"Disney Stars\\" in Romania and Bulgaria, featuring the series Kim Possible, Phineas and Ferb, American Dragon and Hannah Montana. High School Musical aired on August 22, 2008 and High School Musical 2 aired on November 1, 2008. It was fully dubbed into Romanian, and an old Bulgarian translation of Kim Possible (once aired on BNT Channel 1) was made available on October 20, 2008. High School Musical 2 was also dubbed. Subsequently, Phineas and Ferb and American Dragon were also dubbed by Media Link using voice-over dubbing (unlike all pre-2005 Disney cartoon series, which were all dubbed with synchronized voices). This way of dubbing is very common in Bulgarian television, because it costs less and takes less time to produce (as the voices of actors are just placed directly over a quieted original voice track). Usually, only theatrically or home video-released animated films are dubbed with synchronized voices, and in the 1990s only Disney's animated series were dubbed this way for television. Only starting in 2008, Disney allowed Bulgarian broadcasters to dub films themselves, and all of them were using voice-over dubbing. After Disney XD successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, it was expected to be rolled out to European territories in 2009. Later, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Bulgaria and Israel) will be renamed to Disney Channel, marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change took place on September 19, 2009 in the CEE region.Jetix to become Disney - Broadband TV News, by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26 Disney Channel Romania & Bulgaria are broadcast as a single video feed with two audio channels and there is also a Russian audio channel. On September 19, 2009, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. But the Russian feed was still broadcasting under the Jetix name until it was announced that a separate Disney Channel would launch. After the launch of Disney Channel in Romania and Bulgaria, the Jetix feed in Russia began to be independent and got localized, with Russian titlecards and banners with Russian hours.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsnNdhDGXqs On August 10, 2010, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in CIS.

Meanwhile, Disney Channel EMEA is included in the basic package of the digital platform Digi TV in Serbia Fox Kids, then Jetix, and now Disney Channel have been available in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and were mostly broadcast with either the Russian, Romanian, Turkish or English language audio track. In October 2007, a Bulgarian audio track was added to for some of the shows on Jetix. Jetix was previously shown in Bulgaria on bTV, which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney. Translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by Media Link. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008.http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/bulgaria_localisation.html Jetix begins localisation of its Bulgarian Channel - 31 October 2007 (retrieved on November 14, 2007) However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February 2009 until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs were returned to the channel, since translation had advanced a lot. Hannah Montana was the only untranslated show, but it was available in Bulgarian on BNT 1 since March 28, 2009. Promos aired in English and not in Bulgarian. Jetix in Russia was based on this channel, but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos. Certain shows which then did not air on the regular Jetix CEE (W.I.T.C.H., Iggy Arbuckle) were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaced the Disney block. When Jetix CEE was changed to Disney Channel, the Russian-language broadcast ceased. Jetix Russia continued to exist as a separate channel until August 10, 2010.  Disney Junior  Playhouse Disney was launched the same day as Disney Channel as a block. In 2010, Playhouse Disney was launched as a channel, replacing Jetix Play.

In short, the book advises the following: 1\\\\. No reliable methods exist of speedily accumulating vast riches. 2\\\\. One's income should exceed one's expenditures. (The book describes elementary methods to preserve one's capital.) 3\\\\. If one's expenditures exceed one's income, one should determine the nature of the expenditures and whether they can be foregone with equanimity. 4\\\\. One should beware of financial advertising. The advertisers and the financial institutions who offer it often have interests that run counter to those of the small investors whom it targets. 5\\\\. One should put one's first several thousand dollars into an account which is unlikely to lose its nominal value. (The book discusses such accounts. It also discusses bonds, not all of which can be sold indefinitely at par.) 6\\\\. One should employ tax-sheltered accounts to invest for one's retirement and for advanced academic education of one's progeny. 7\\\\. One should commit a fixed sum to no-load, low-expense stock index mutual funds every month for the remainder of one's term in the labor market. One should not commit less money than usual after a severe or prolonged market decline. Nor should one commit more money than usual after the market has ascended sharply for years. (The book discusses common stocks, their advantages and hazards as investment media.) 8\\\\. One cannot reliably achieve higher returns from the stock market than the market average, no matter how much time and effort one devotes to the task. And one can achieve nearly the same return as the market average almost without devoting time or effort to the task by periodically committing a fixed sum to index funds. Therefore, one should make the periodic commitment of one's money and return to one's regular routine. 9\\\\. One should omit complex, laborious, expensive, unreliable tactics that are alleged by some to enable one to achieve higher returns than the stock market average. (The book discusses an assortment of them and explains why one should not devote much time, effort, or expenditure of money to them.) One should merely periodically commit a fixed sum to index funds. 10\\\\. Investing in commodities, or coins, stamps, automobiles, collectables, autographs, pictures, art or anything like that is not worth the cost for the amateur investor because of 2 reasons: You are not an expert, so you will probably be buying from an expert. Second, even if you buy at a good price, you will be selling to an expert, and lose money by selling to one. (pg 10) 11\\\\. Low Price-Earnings stocks beat the market the majority of the time.

The original portable home fitness device was invented by Gert F. K√∂lbel in 1962. The devices before the Bullworker =Arthur Aubriot Pons= Pons' physical exercise device The original device was patented in 1912 by an American Citizen from Brooklyn, Arthur A. Pons.Patent : US1023756A The device looked quite alike the first bullworker to come (without strings). It consisted of three sleeved, spring-loaded, telescopic cylinders in the center, with two hand grips affixed at the outermost ends. The patent states: \\"The invention consists essentially in the novel construction and arrangement of parts whereby spring controlled telescopic members are embodied in an exercising apparatus in a special manner more particularly described hereinafter. The objects of the invention are to devise a portable exercising apparatus particularly for the development of the chest and arm muscles, suitable for both old and young persons by reason of the interchangeability of the resilient member and generally to provide an exercising apparatus to be operated by the hands and arms, simple in construction, cheap to manufacture, durable and interchangeable as to its parts\\".US1023756A =Arthur William Chapman= Chapman's physical exerciser A second device, invented in 1937 by Arthur William Chapman would be used to create the Bullworker. The patent states: \\"The invention relates to physical exercisers for human use, and seeks to provide in a single device means whereby a large variety of beneficial exercises for the body and limbs may be carried out. An object of the invention is to provide an exerciser usable by compression between the hands or parts of the body or limbs. A further object is to provide such an exerciser with a degree of adjustability so that as the user's physique improves the effort he has to exert may be increased. Again, an object is to provide simple means Whereby the adjustment at the time being may readily be observed. A minor object is to provide locking means for transport or storage of the device, and other objects will become apparent, more especially in relation to economical and convenient constructional features\\".Patent of the \\"Physical exerciser\\" by Arthur William Chapman Isometric exercises In the 1950s, German scientists Dr. Erich Albert M√ºllerErich A.

The study at the Max Planck Institute consisted of over 200 experiments over a ten-year period. Theodor Hettinger published his book Physiology of Strength.Physiology of Strength. Theodor Hettinger, M.D. Edited by M. H. Thurwell. Springfield, Illinois, Charles C. Thomas, 1961 They both developed a training program based on isometrics exercise.Crakes, J. G. (1957).

Baley put isometrics to the test with a class of 104 college students at the University of Connecticut. The Bullworker manual claimed that study resulted in the isometric training group improving three times faster than the sports training group on tests measuring increases in strength, endurance, coordination, and agility. However, the original article is far more complex even if it showed significant gains after a 4 week program of isometric exercises.Effects of Isometric Exercises Done with a Belt upon the Physical Fitness Status of Students in Required Physical Education Classes, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, Volume 37, 1966 - Issue 3. The Tensolator and the first Bullworker device Image from the bullworker patent In the early 1960s, Gert F. K√∂lbel used and enhanced the devices of Pons and Chapman to create the Tensolator which became the Bullworker, a portable home fitness device and the seven second isometric exercise principle for the fastest strength gains, using both contraction and extension movements involving range of motion for all the major muscle groups, into one lightweight and compact fitness tool at a price everyone could afford. The US patent states: \\"The invention relates to physical exercisers, and more particularly to a device for human use by which a large variety of physical exercisers for training and strengthening the muscular system of the body may be carried out. It is an object of the invention to provide an exerciser usable by compression, pull and expansion. Another object is to provide an exerciser of simple and robust construction which is safe against accidents. A further object is to provide an exerciser which the user may manipulate with his hands and feet and may also support against the floor, wall or ceiling of a room\\".United States Patent Office, SPRING TYPE PHYSICAL EXERCISER Gert F. K√∂lbel The original Bullworker device consists of two sleeved, spring-loaded, telescopic cylinders in the center, with two hand grips affixed at the outermost ends. Two opposing cables are attached to the hand grips at each end of the device. The original Bullworker exercise apparatus weighs about four pounds (1.8 kilograms). Exercises are performed by pushing inwards on the contractible cylinders, by pulling the cables outwards away from the cylinders, or any variation of these. The resultant compression of the internal spring creates the desired resistance.United States Patent Office, SPRING TYPE PHYSICAL EXERCISER Gert F. K√∂lbel The Bullworker will return to its original position when pressure is released. A range of up to 150 pounds (68 kilograms) or more of resistance is possible in the Bullworker exercise routines. Reception and fame of the device Bullworker exploded on the fitness scene revolutionizing exercise for muscle strength to be more effective and much faster. Bullworker enjoyed widespread popularity in Europe and the United States in the 1960s and 1970s during the personal fitness craze. Various charts were then introduced, proposing different work to exercise and develop the muscles. Later Bullworker versions Bullworker X5 Since the original Bullworker fitness device was made available for purchase and use by the general public in the 1960s, a number of modified and improved different versions of the original Bullworker have been made available since its introduction, particularly Bullworker 2, Bullworker Deluxe, and Bullworker X5. However, the Bullworker's functional isometric concepts to improve physical fitness remained the same. The major improvement was the X5 model, which had been patented. The patent of the X5 describes it as: \\"...a spring type exerciser involving a telescopic arrangement including a spring so that as the telescopic system is collapsed the spring is placed under compression; also an endless rope is connected to the handles at the ends of the telescopic system so that as two runs of the rope are pulled apart the spring is again placed under compression. In use certain exercises comprise squeezing the spring by applying force to the handles at each end and certain exercises comprise pulling the two runs of rope apart and again placing the spring under compression. In this way the exercises bring into play different muscles involving forces of both compression and tension while at the same time the work by the person using the exerciser always acts on the spring to place i under compression. An object of the present invention is to provide a physical exerciser of the type described in [the] U.S. Pat. No. 3,268,225 which is simplified in construction and allows the user the possibility of carrying out a wider range of exercises. It is another object of the invention to provide an exerciser which gives a greater amount of contraction for the same initial length of telescopic system. It is a still further object of the invention to produce an exerciser which allows the user to vary the movement distance during an exercise and to vary the strength required to move the tension elements during exercise\\".Patent of the Bullworker X5. Current versions Bullworker in the 2010s, with grips Though Bullworker's popularity fell off in the 1980s when personal gyms became readily available, new models had been created by Hughes Marketing, LLC: the Bullworker Bow Classic and the Bullworker Steel-Bow. * The Bow Classic is 36 inches long, and is the Bullworker 'barbell' equivalent, specializing in powerful holds and greater range of motion. * The Steel-Bow is 20 inches long and is the Bullworker dumbbell specializing in versatility for muscle targeting and travel. Both Bullworker models have interchangeable springs to easily change resistance levels, ranging from approximately 0-130 lbs (0‚Äì60 kg) of resistance. The original Bullworker suggested 26 individual exercises. While isometrics was the emphasis, the instructions included isotonic, cardio, resiliency and endurance routines. The emphasis on these additional functions greatly expanded the number of exercises available. An additional fitness routine of Iso-Motion has since been added. Bullworkers are well built and very durable; many early units remain in regular fitness use decades later.

The aircraft progressed no further than a nearly complete airframe before cancellation in 1946. The first American attempt to design such an escape capsule was for the U.S. Navy F4D Skyray. It was tested in 1951-52 but was never installed in the aircraft. The Bell X-2, designed for flight in excess of Mach 3, could jettison the cockpit, though the pilot would still have to jump out and descend under his own parachute.NASA Dryden Research Fact Sheet - Bell X-2 Starbuster The first production aircraft with an escape crew capsule was the Mach 2 B-58 Hustler. It was developed by the Stanley Aviation Company for Convair. The capsule was pressurized, sheltered the pilot from the airstream, and contained food and survival supplies.Octave Chanute Aerospace MuseumEjection Site - EB-58 Hustler During testing of the \\"Stanley Capsule\\" in 1962, a bear became the first living creature to survive a supersonic ejection. The Mach 3 XB-70's two crew escape capsules did not work well the only time they were needed. On June 8, 1966, XB-70 airframe AV/2 was involved in a mid-air crash with an F-104 Starfighter. Maj. Carl Cross's seat was unable to retract backwards into the escape capsule due to high-g-forces as the plane spiraled downwards. He died in the crash. Maj. Al White's seat did retract but his elbow protruded from the capsule and blocked the closing clamshell doors. He struggled to free his trapped elbow. As soon as he freed the doors, he was ejected from the plane and descended by parachute as planned. Due to pain and confusion, White failed to trigger the manually activated airbag that would normally cushion the capsule upon landing. When the capsule hit the ground, White was subjected to an estimated 33 to 44 g (320 to 430 m/s¬≤). He received serious injuries, but nevertheless survived.NASA Dryden Research Fact Sheet - XB-70 F-111E In the 1960s and 1970s, the F-111 and B-1A introduced the method of jettisoning the entire cockpit as a means of crew escape. The crew remains strapped in the cabin, unencumbered by a parachute harness, while 27,000 lbf (120 kN) of thrust from rockets accelerates the module away from the rest of the aircraft. A single, large parachute retards the descent of the capsule. On landing, an airbag system cushions the impact. In the event of a water landing the airbag acts as a flotation device. Additional airbags could be activated to right the capsule in the event of a water landing (similar to the Apollo capsule), or an additional airbag could be selected for auxiliary flotation. With a movement of a pin at the base of the pilot's control stick, a bilge pump could be activated and extra air pumped into the airbags. For the F-111 escape capsule, following a successful landing on land or water, it could serve as a survival shelter for the crew until a rescue could be mounted. Three of the four B-1A prototypes featured a single crew escape capsule for the crew members. For the fourth prototype and for the B-1B, this was changed to use conventional ejection seats. One source gives the reason \\"due to concerns about servicing the pyrotechnical components of the system,\\" while another says this was done \\"to save cost and weight.\\"Global Security's B-1A Lancer On August 29, 1984, B-1A prototype #2 crashed and the capsule was ejected at low altitude. The parachute deployed improperly and one of the three crew died.Vector Site B-1BEjection Seat Site B-1A Ejection seats vs. escape crew capsules Kelly Johnson, founder of Lockheed Skunk Works, and developer of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird family of spy planes, commented on escape crew capsules when discussing development of the YF-12A (Blackbird) ejection seat: \\"We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity on the ground and through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did achieve our design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high velocity re-entry from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the pressure suit, which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft.\\"\\"Some Development Aspects of the YF-12A Interceptor Aircraft\\", Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, Vice President, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Burbank, California, July 1969. As quoted in Miller, Jay, \\"Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works\\", Midland Publishing Ltd., page 212, middle of column 2. Rather than using escape capsules, SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore full pressure suits for high-altitude ejections. The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.

He served as a junior minister in the 1970s. He was also a barrister, World War II cavalry officer, amateur rugby player and company director. Early life and education Kershaw was born in Cairo, the second son of Jack F. Kershaw‚Äîa judge at the Cairo Court of Appeal‚Äîand his wife, Anne, who hailed from Kentucky. He was educated at Eton College, where he played cricket. His father died when he was 13, and his elder brother, Overton, two years later. Kershaw read law at Balliol College, Oxford, where he befriended his contemporary Edward Heath. He became a barrister, and was called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1939. He married Barbara Edith Crookenden‚Äîdaughter of solicitor Harry Crookenden‚Äîin 1939. They had two daughters and two sons named Carolyn, Harry, Cecilia and George. War service At the beginning of World War II, Kershaw served with the Thames River police, then was commissioned second lieutenant in the 16th/5th Lancers on 15 June 1940. He was promoted temporary captain, and landed in North Africa in November 1942 in Operation Torch. He served in tanks, and was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his actions north of the Kasserine Gap in Tunisia in 1943. On 21 February 1943 he was a brigade staff officer (GSO3) with 26th Armoured Brigade (which comprised his own regiment amongst others) and had command of the brigade command tank. The brigadier was commanding from a scout car whose radio broke down. Kershaw, despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, repeatedly ran from his tank, to the scout car, and back, to take the brigadier's orders, which he then relayed over the tank's radio. The following day, a German counterattack was believed to be imminent. Kershaw volunteered to man his tank, which had been disabled, to bring additional fire to bear on the advancing forces; despite its vulnerability to artillery fire as it was in full view on a road. Promoted temporary major, he landed in Normandy three days after D-Day (D+3) as brigade major (GSO1) of an armoured brigade and fought in northern France and Belgium, before becoming an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. After the war, he transferred to the Inns of Court Regiment in the Territorial Army on 6 May 1948, reverting to his war substantive rank of captain. He transferred into the TA reserve of officers on 16 August 1949 and was granted the honorary rank of major. He returned to the active list, joining the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars as a captain once more, on 25 May 1951. He regained the rank of major on 13 March 1954, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 6 April 1955, and commanded the regiment until he again transferred to the TA reserve of officers on 7 April 1958. Political career Kershaw returned to the bar after the war. He also served as a member of the London County Council from 1946 to 1949, and as a councillor on the Westminster City Council from 1947 to 1948. He played rugby union for Harlequins. Kershaw contested Gloucester in 1950 and 1951. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stroud in 1955, remaining in that position until his retirement at the 1987 general election, with a substantially increased majority. He supported National Service in his maiden speech. He became private secretary to the Secretary of State for War, Antony Head, in 1956, and became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Edward Heath in 1963, when Heath was Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development and President of the Board of Trade. He was a member of the Executive of the 1922 Committee from 1964 to 1966, and resumed the position as Heath's PPS in 1967, when Heath was Leader of the Opposition. Kershaw represented the Conservatives at the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. After the Conservatives returned to power following the 1970 general election, Kershaw became a junior minister during the 1970‚Äì1974 Conservative government, first as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Public Building and Works (1970), then, after the death of Iain Macleod, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1970‚Äì1973), and finally Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Defence with responsibility for the Royal Air Force (June 1973 ‚Äì January 1974), replacing Lord Lambton who resigned after a sex scandal. He was unwaveringly loyal to Heath's successor, Margaret Thatcher, but his political views (he supported abortion but opposed hanging; he also supported the European Union and electoral reform) barred him from further ministerial office. He served as chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select committee from 1979 to 1987, and again on the 1922 Committee executive from 1983 to 1987. He was knighted in the 1981 New Year Honours, \\"[f]or political and public service\\". In 1984, he was forwarded information received by Tam Dalyell relating to the sinking of the General Belgrano in the Falklands War, which showed that the full facts had not been released to the public. Kershaw sent the information to the Ministry of Defence, which identified the leak as originating with Clive Ponting, who was tried (but acquitted) for an offence under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. Kershaw joined the National Committee for Electoral Reform in 1976, and served as a vice-chairman of the British Council from 1974 to 1987. He also continued his legal work, and was an adviser to British American Tobacco and the Association of British Marine Tools. Having kept wicket at Eton, he later played for the House of Commons cricket team. He became Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 1989, and served as Vice-Lord Lieutenant from 1990 to 1993. Personal life  He hunted with the Beaufort Hunt and the Berkeley Hunt, and also enjoyed shooting, stalking and gardening. He died in Didmarton in Gloucestershire. He was survived by his wife and their four children.

After a music school, she enjoyed an operatic career lasting for over two decades and worked with such conductors as Colin Davis and Herbert von Karajan. She was one of the few English singers of her generation to be invited to sing in productions at the Salzburg Festival and La Scala, Milan, as well as at the Metropolitan Opera. After early performances at Glyndebourne and five years at Sadler's Wells Opera Company in the 1960s, Harwood sang at Covent Garden and Scottish Opera before building an international reputation in the 1970s. Her repertoire was extensive, but she was particularly notable for her performances in the operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss. In the concert hall, she performed in oratorio, and in her later years she concentrated on Lieder recitals. She died of cancer at the age of 52. Biography =Early years= Harwood was born in Barton Seagrave, a suburb of Kettering, but grew up in Yorkshire. She attended Skipton Girls' High School. Her parents were both musical, and her mother, a professional soprano, taught her singing. Harwood later said of her childhood, \\"My mother sang under the name Constance Read, and she did quite a bit of early broadcasting from Birmingham. When she had her children ‚Äì there were three of us ‚Äì she did local singing and took up her teaching. My father, in the Methodist Chapel tradition, did a good deal of conducting\\". Harwood continued her studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1956.Blyth, Alan. \\"Elizabeth Harwood\\", Grove Music Online, accessed 9 December 2009 (subscription required). In 1957, for the Buxton Opera Group, she sang Michaela in Passion Flower, an adaptation of Carmen.Wickham, M. Sarah.

She was later a joint winner of the international Verdi competition in Busseto.The Times obituary, 23 June 1990, p. 23 =Operatic career= Harwood made her professional d√©but as Second Boy in The Magic Flute at Glyndebourne in 1960. The critic of The Guardian wrote of an early performance by Harwood, \\"[her] voice, though not very big, is a real Mozart voice alive with an easy sensuousness that is rare among English sopranos.\\"The Guardian, 1 June 1960, p. 9 At a performance of Messiah in December 1960, Harwood's fellow soloists included Janet Baker, with whom she later made a series of critically praised appearances for Scottish Opera.The Guardian, 26 November 1960, p. 5 In 1961 Sadler's Wells Opera Company engaged her, and she played Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto,The Guardian, 27 October 1961, p. 9 Countess Ad√®le in Rossini's Le Comte Ory,The Guardian, 21 February 1963, p. 7 and Phyllis in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, in which the critic of The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal thought that \\"despite Elizabeth Harwood's beautiful singing, attractive costume and appearance, her spoken word was charged with innuendo, presenting a most worldly young lady\\".The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal, September 1964, p. 244 Her other early roles at Sadler's Wells included Mozart's Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro and Constanze in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, the title role in Massenet's Manon and of Richard Strauss's coloratura parts, Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos and the Fiakermilli in Arabella. Of this period The Times said, \\"Here Colin Davis was one of the leading influences on a soprano who looked well on stage and sang with a sense of fun.\\" In 1965 Harwood took a break from Sadler's Wells, and toured Australia with the Sutherland Williamson Grand Opera Company, alternating with Joan Sutherland as the title character in Lucia di Lammermoor and Amina in La sonnambula. After her return, Colin Davis left Sadler's Wells, and Harwood thought it time to move on. She joined the English Opera Group, singing Galatea in Acis and Galatea in Sweden, Versailles and at the Aldeburgh Festival. She made her Covent Garden d√©but as the Fiakermilli in 1967, which she followed with other coloratura parts, such as Gilda, both of which she had sung in English at Sadler's Wells. She rarely sang in modern operas, but an exception was as Bella in Michael Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage, where \\"her radiant stage appearance was seen to good effect in the high lyrical role\\". Davis again was the conductor, and Harwood later made one of her biggest successes when appearing under his baton as Teresa in Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini. Her other Covent Garden roles included Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Norina in Don Pasquale, and the title roles in Arabella and Manon. For Scottish Opera, between 1967 and 1974, she sang Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor and Fiordiligi in Cos√¨ fan Tutte to the Dorabella of Janet Baker,The Times, 12 February 1969, p. 8 as well as Sophie to Baker's Oktavian in Der Rosenkavalier.The Guardian, 23 May 1971, p. 27 In 1967, Harwood had played Donna Elvira in the Aix-en-Provence Festival's production of Don Giovanni. She was invited back in 1969 for Acis and Galatea. Her success in this and in her Scottish Opera roles attracted the attention of Herbert von Karajan, who invited her to appear at the Salzburg Festival the following year. There she played Fiordiligi and Constanze, and two years later Karajan cast her as the Countess in his Salzburg production of The Marriage of Figaro. He invited her to play roles at several more Salzburg Festivals.\\"Elizabeth Harwood, A British Soprano, 52\\", The New York Times obituary, 24 June 1990, accessed 10 December 2009 She made her d√©but at La Scala, Milan, as Constanze in 1971The Times, 4 December 1971, p. 9 and played other roles there in 1972. Her d√©but at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, was in 1975 as Fiordiligi. For Glyndebourne, Harwood played Fiordiligi, Countess Almaviva, and, in 1982, the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier.The Guardian, 18 June 1982, p. 11 Her last operatic performance was in 1983 in La colombe at Sadlers' Wells. =Concerts and last years= Throughout her career, Harwood gave numerous recitals and took part in many oratorios. She performed over 100 times in Messiah, the first time being at age 16, filling in for her mother. During the 1980s, she toured in concert internationally, including New Zealand (1983), Australia (1986), and British Columbia (1988). She was invited to sing on many occasions at the Rasigu√®res Festival of Wine and Music in France. From the mid-1970s, Harwood began to concentrate on song recitals: The Times wrote of this period in her career, \\"In the mid-1970s ... she was more likely to be heard in Lieder at the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Wigmore Hall than at Covent Garden\\". One of her later appearances was at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in 1986, in a programme including Schubert Lieder.The Musical Times, September 1986, p. 535 Her final public performance was in November 1989 at the Bath Festival.The Gramophone, August 1990, p. 21 In 1966, she married the businessman Julian A. C. Royle, a publisher of greetings cards.The Gramophone, September 1973, p. 25 They had one son, Nicholas. Harwood died at her home in Fryerning, Essex, England in 1990, aged 52, from cancer. The Musical Times wrote of her, > \\"Elizabeth Harwood's lovely, warm voice, with its effortless production and > evenness throughout a remarkable range, was matched by her level-headed > approach to the world of opera and the generous nature of her > personality.\\"Hartford, Robert. The Musical Times obituary, September 1990, > p. 343 Janet Baker said this about Harwood: \\"Elizabeth was the most beloved of my colleagues, a beautiful person in every way.

In Benjamin Britten's recording of his A Midsummer Night's Dream, she sang Tytania. Her other opera recordings include Delius's A Village Romeo and Juliet.The Gramophone, February 1973, p 97 A video recording of Harwood as Violetta in La traviata was issued in 1999.The Gramophone She had only one solo recital disc, a selection of English art songs by Frederick Delius, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frank Bridge, Arnold Bax, Michael Head, George Lloyd, and Roger Quilter recorded in London in 1983, released on the Conifer label, with John Constable on the piano. It has not been reissued on compact disc. Another disc of traditional English songs such as Cherry Ripe and Early One Morning was a joint recital with baritone Owen Brannigan from 1964, conducted by Charles Mackerras. In oratorio, Harwood was able to perform in both the traditional big-scale Handelian style and the emerging smaller-scale \\"period performance\\" style, recording the soprano part in Messiah for both Sir Malcolm Sargent, a traditionalist, and Charles Mackerras, whose 1967 recording was a landmark in period performance.The Gramophone, December 1989, p. 128 There is a recording of \\"Rigoletto\\" from Sadler's Wells Opera, in English, with Elizabeth Harwood, Donald Smith, Peter Glossop, Donald McIntyre, with the Sadler's Wells Orchestra conducted by James Lockhart - possibly 1963.

The basic purpose is to make recorded speech contain more words in a given time, yet still be understandable. For example: a paragraph that might normally be expected to take 20 seconds to read, might instead be presented in 15 seconds, which would represent a time-compression of 25% (5 seconds out of 20). The term \\"time-compressed speech\\" should not be confused with \\"speech compression\\", which controls the volume range of a sound, but does not alter its time envelope.  Methods  While some voice talents are capable of speaking at rates significantly in excess of general norms, the term \\"time- compressed speech\\" most usually refers to examples in which the time-reduction has been accomplished through some form of electronic processing of the recorded speech. In general, recorded speech can be electronically time- compressed by: increasing its speed (linear compression); removing silences (selective editing); a combination of the two (non-linear compression). The speed of a recording can be increased, which will cause the material to be presented at a faster rate (and hence in a shorter amount of time), but this has the undesirable side-effect of increasing the frequency of the whole passage, raising the pitch of the voices, which can reduce intelligibility. There are normally silences between words and sentences, and even small silences within certain words, both of which can be reduced or removed (\\"edited-out\\") which will also reduce the amount of time occupied by the full speech recording. However, this can also have the effect of removing verbal \\"punctuation\\" from the speech, causing words and sentences to run together unnaturally, again reducing intelligibility. The current preferred method of time-compression is called \\"non-linear compression\\", which employs a combination of selectively removing silences; speeding up the speech to make the reduced silences sound normally-proportioned to the text; and finally applying various data algorithms to bring the speech back down to the proper pitch. This produces a more acceptable result than either of the two earlier techniques; however, if unrestrained, removing the silences and increasing the speed can make a selection of speech sound more insistent, possibly to the point of unpleasantness.  Applications  =Advertising= Time-compressed speech is frequently used in television and radio advertising. The advantage of time-compressed speech is that the same number of words can be compressed into a smaller amount of time, reducing advertising costs, and/or allowing more information to be included in a given radio or TV advertisement. It is usually most noticeable in the information-dense caveats and disclaimers presented (usually by legal requirement) at the end of commercials‚Äîthe aural equivalent of the \\"fine print\\" in a printed contract. This practice, however, is not new: before electronic methods were developed, spokespeople who could talk extremely quickly and still be understood were widely used as voice talents for radio and TV advertisements, and especially for recording such disclaimers. =Education= Time-compressed speech has educational applications such as increasing the information density of trainings, and as a study aid. A number of studies have demonstrated that the average person is capable of relatively easily comprehending speech delivered at higher-than- normal rates, with the peak occurring at around 25% compression (that is, 25% faster than normal); this facility has been demonstrated in several languages. Conversational speech (in English) takes place at a rate of around 150 wpm (words per minute), but the average person is able to comprehend speech presented at rates of up to 200-250 wpm without undue difficulty.Barabasz, A. F.; A study of recall and retention of accelerated lecture presentation; Journal of Communication; 18(3), 1968: p.283‚Äì287.Benz, C.R.; Effects of Time Compressed Speech Upon the Comprehension of A Visual Oriented Television Lecture (1971); cited in Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology; by David H. Jonassen; Association of Educational Communications and Technology (AECT); Bloomington, IN: 2004. Blind and severely visually impaired subjects scored similar comprehension levels at even higher rates, up to 300-350 wpm. Blind people have been found to use time-compressed speech extensively, for example, when reviewing recorded lectures from high school and college classes, or professional trainings. Comprehension rates in older blind subjects have been found to be as good, or in some cases better than those found in younger sighted subjects.Gordon- Salant, S and Friedman, S. A.; Recognition of Rapid Speech By Blind and Sighted Adults; Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research; 54(2), April 2011: p.622-631 Other studies have determined that the ability to comprehend highly time-compressed speech tends to fall off with increased age,Gordon-Salant, S. and Fitzgibbons, P.J.; Sources of age-related recognition difficulty for time-compressed speech; Journal of Language, Speech, and Hearing Research; 44(4), August 2001: p.709-19 and is also reduced when the language of the time-compressed speech is not the listener's native language.Zhoa, Y.; The effects of listeners' control of speech rate on second language comprehension; Applied Linguistics; 18(1), March 2997: p.49-68 Non- native speakers can, however, improve their comprehension level of time- compressed speech with multiday training.Banai, K. and Lavner, Y.; Perceptual Learning of Time-Compressed Speech: More than Rapid Adaptation; PLoS One; National Institute of Health; Bethesda, Maryland: &(10), October 2012 =Voice Mail= Voice mail systems have employed time-compressed speech since as far back as the 1970s.

Early life Covel grew up in Edgemont, South Dakota and attended college at the University of Nebraska, Kearney, majoring in Broadcast Management with a minor in acting. Covel then took a position as a headhunter in San Francisco, and eventually opened his own firm before ultimately turning his attention back to film making. Covel received a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, Peter Stark Producing Program where he occasionally lectures.Notable Alumni , USC School of Cinematic Arts, Accessed March 10, 2008. Career After college, Covel began work on the film Think Tank. In 2003 he joined the team writing and producing Napoleon Dynamite, which won critical acclaim. For his and Chris Wyatt's work on the film, they were nominated for the producer award at the 20th Independent Spirit Awards. Covel's other producing credits include 12 Dogs of Christmas, Beneath, Carter & June and Cafe. In 2019, Covel gave a TED talk entitled ‚ÄúThe mind is a computer. The question is how,‚Äù on the mental framework of problem-solving. Philanthropy In 2015, he founded a children's charity, 12 Days of Pizza, which works annually with Pizza Ranch to help low-income elementary school children eat over school holiday periods. It started with 144 meals being provided to 12 families. Within a three-year period, the program grew to provide over 12,000 meals to over 1000 food-insecure families with elementary school aged children. The program continues to expand each year. The program is also available for people affected due to coronavirus. In 2019, Covel partnered with illustrator Rebecca Swift to launch a 64-book series for kids, in which the title character is called Porter the Hoarder. The first book, Porter the Hoarder and the Ransacked Room, was a bestseller in 2019. The Porter the Hoarder series is now part of a charitable program with The United Way called Black Hills Reads.

The flooding was very widespread, affecting numerous rivers, lakes and communities from upstate New York to North Carolina. It was widely considered to be the worst flooding in the region since Hurricane David in 1979. It was also one of the worst floodings in the United States since Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. At least 16 deaths were related to the flooding. Meteorological history NOAA/USGS map of river flooding, June 29, 2006, around 1530 UTC. Note the purples and reds in the Northeastern United States. Click the image for a color key. The flooding was attributed to several weather factors that all came together over the region. The primary factor was the stalling of the jet stream just to the west of the Appalachian Mountains. That, combined with the Bermuda High over the Atlantic Ocean, blocked any systems from moving inland or offshore. The influence of a tropical low (which nearly became a tropical storm but did not attain a full surface circulation) off the North Carolina coast allowed a constant stream of tropical moisture to enter the Mid-Atlantic region. The resulting heavy and prolonged rains overflowed the banks of many rivers, lakes, and streams, leading to the flooding. A senior National Weather Service meteorologist declared that rain events of this size take place in the region only every 200 years. Impact Rainfall in the East, June 23‚Äì29, 2006 =Delaware= Considerable flooding occurred in much of Delaware, particularly in Sussex County, where Governor Ruth Ann Minner declared a state of emergency. The hardest hit community was Seaford, where 40 families were temporarily homeless and many homes and businesses were damaged. =District of Columbia= Significant street and river flooding was reported in Washington, D.C. Several important federal buildings, including the National Archives and Records Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Justice and some of the Smithsonian Institution, were closed. Mayor Anthony A. Williams declared a state of emergency as a result of the flooding and the threat of power outages and other problems. Sections of Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park were washed out. The road was closed for several months for repair and reinforcing. Beach Drive is the main north-south road through the park and is a major commuter artery. =Maryland= The most severe flooding took place in and around Montgomery County. Over 2,200 people had to be evacuated from the area south of Lake Needwood in Rockville due to concerns of a dam break there (the earthen dam was leaking). If the dam were to break, communities downstream could be under as much as of flood water. The dam did not break, however, and the evacuations ended on the evening of June 29. U.S. Route 29 (Colesville Road) in Silver Spring and Maryland Route 198 near Fort Meade were among the dozens of roadways closed due to high water. Parts of Laurel in Prince George's County were also evacuated after floodgates were opened to relieve pressure on a nearby dam. In Frederick County, three people were killed when they attempted to cross the flood waters from Middle Creek.Three Killed When Washed Out Of Truck Bed - Baltimore News Story - WBAL Baltimore Also in Frederick County, a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy drowned while swimming in a swollen creek that feeds into the Monocacy River. On July 4 in Prince George's County, the body of a 22-year-old man was recovered. It was determined that his car was swept off U.S. 29 by the floodwaters nearly two weeks prior. In Harford County, several inches of rain fell for several days. Parts of the Susquehanna River and Deer Creek flooded, and several rescues were performed. Damage to roads and agriculture in the Eastern Shore region alone was estimated to be around $12 million. On Friday, June 30, Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich requested federal disaster aid for five Maryland counties: Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Harford, and Montgomery. However, Ehrlich stated in a letter requesting the aid to President George W. Bush that more counties could be included after damage assessments. Governor Ehrlich stated that damages in Maryland could exceed $10 million. Ehrlich also requested, in addition to federal disaster aid, funds for \\"hazard mitigation assistance\\", which is federal money used to help governments rebuild antiquated structures with modern structures. Ehrlich also obtained loans from the federal Small Business Administration to help private property owners, both residential and business, to rebuild or repair damaged buildings. =New Jersey= The heaviest flooding in New Jersey was along and near the Delaware River, on the border with Pennsylvania. Over 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Trenton, and some state government buildings were closed. In addition, Trenton's water filtration system was shut down because of debris floating down the Delaware, and Mayor Douglas Palmer called for conservation, saying the city had only about two days of drinkable water. The river was expected to crest Friday at nearly over flood stage, the fourth-highest level on record for Trenton. Governor Jon Corzine had declared a state of emergency for the entire state as a result of the flooding.cbs3.com - Governor Declares State Of Emergency In New Jersey =New York= Water from the Neversink River rushes over a road in Deerpark, New York Significant flooding took place in the Southern Tier region, particularly around Binghamton and Waverly/Sayre (on the New York-Pennsylvania border). Riverside communities were severely flooded, and many evacuations took place in the region which stretched along the Susquehanna, Chenango, Delaware and Unadilla rivers.State Of Emergency Around Southern Tier  WBNG-TV Binghamton, NY  Local Top Stories The Susquehanna River in Bainbridge crested at , over the flood stage. This was the highest the river had ever reached in the Bainbridge area. In Broome County alone, over 5,000 people were forced to evacuate, particularly in the submerged town of Conklin. Two people were killed when a section of Interstate 88 washed away and two trucks drove into the chasm created. The Mohawk River valley also experienced significant flooding, with damage occurring to Lock 10 on the Erie Canal. In Port Jervis, the Delaware River flooded low areas of the city that had barely recovered from the record flooding of April 2005. The Neversink River also swelled, prompting officials to close the Neversink bridge. The Mid-Delaware Bridge (carrying US 6 and 209) was also closed. Governor George Pataki estimated that damage in the state could exceed $100 million. Many of the records levels during this flood would be topped five years later in 2011 when the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee struck the area. =Pennsylvania= US 6 & 209 flooded by the Delaware River at Westfall, PA The worst flooding in the state took place in the Susquehanna River valley and its tributaries. Over 200,000 residents in northeastern Pennsylvania had to be evacuated due to the rising floodwaters. Damage in Susquehanna County alone totaled over $100 million (2006 USD). Extensive river flooding was reported in dozens of communities in eastern Pennsylvania. Over 70 people had to be rescued from rooftops by U.S. Coast Guard helicopters after being stranded by the floodwaters. At the Wilkes-Barre flood protection levee, the river was at , which was about the record level reached in Hurricane Agnes and at which point catastrophic flooding takes place. Forecasts predicted that the river would crest at above , exceeding any other event other than Agnes and leading to significant flooding in other communities with less protection. Luzerne County officials said the large evacuations were precautionary, as there was a potential for the area to be isolated if the most severe predictions took hold. In Reading, the Schuylkill River's flood stage is , and the river was projected to crest at about , resulting in the worst flooding in the area since Hurricane Agnes. In Easton, the Delaware River crested at above flood stage. At Riegelsville, the river was at above flood level, and at New Hope it crested at above flood level. In Harrisburg, a festival's start in the city was pushed back and cut down, due to the potential for the flood, and the Harrisburg Senators were forced to play 2 \\"home games\\" in Bowie, Maryland, due to flooding in Commerce Bank Park. Philadelphia's Kelly Drive and West River Drive were closed. The Knoebels amusement park in Elysburg was closed due to the flooding of local creeks and did not reopen until Friday afternoon.

The creek crested at around 7 am on June 29, breaking the previous official record of , which was set September 27, 1975. However, this did not come close to the flooding after Hurricane Agnes, which caused the creek to crest at approximately on June 23, 1972. Hummelstown was flooded briefly (3‚Äì4 days), mainly across Duke and Water streets, as well as the railroad tracks. In Pike County, the Delaware River caused extensive damage to Matamoras Borough and Westfall Township. The Delaware crested in the early hours of 29 June at at Milford (as per NOAA hydrograph ) The record level of the river at Milford is , and flood stage is . On Friday, 30 June, U.S. Route 209 between Milford and the Monroe County line at Lehman Township was closed. In Wayne County, the opening of the Lake Wallenpaupack spillway caused damage downstream. The Delaware River also caused damage on the eastern border of the county. Damage in Wayne County totaled about $50 million (2006 USD). Of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania, 46 were under a state of emergency as declared by Governor Ed Rendell. Four deaths were confirmed in Pennsylvania; two in Luzerne County, one near Gettysburg, and one in rural Wayne County. In Lackawaxen, the Zane Grey museum, part of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River, sustained significant damage. =Virginia= Flooding occurred in many areas in Virginia, particularly in the north.

It is among those sonnets referred to as the procreation sonnets, within the Fair Youth sequence. Although the previous sonnet, Sonnet 15, does not overtly discuss procreation, Sonnet 16 opens with \\"But...\\" and goes on to make the encouragement clear. The two poems form a diptych. In Sonnet 16, the speaker asks the young man why he does not actively fight against time and age by having a child. Structure Sonnet 16 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. This type of sonnet consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet. It follows the English sonnet's typical rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, a type of metre in which each line is based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The fifth line exhibits a regular iambic pattern: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Now stand you on the top of happy hours, (16.5) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Alternatively, \\"hours\\" (and its rhyme \\"flowers\\") may be scanned as two- syllable words, giving lines five and seven final extrametrical syllables or feminine endings. Synopsis and analysis Sonnet 16 asks why the youth doesn't strive more forcefully (\\"a mightier way\\") to wage war against \\"this bloody tyrant time?\\" Why, the poet continues, doesn't the youth take precautions as he declines (\\"fortify your self in your decay\\") by some more fruitful (\\"blessed\\") means than the poet's own sterile efforts (\\"barren rhyme\\")? The poet pictures the youth standing \\"on the top of happy hours\\", the time when the stars or the wheel of fortune blessed an individual. There, since the \\"happy hour\\" was used of both nuptials and childbirth, the youth controls the moment when he might beget children, as well as his destiny. On this note, a \\"maiden garden\\" is a womb yet to be made fruitful. To \\"set\\" a garden was to 'sow' it (compare Sonnet 15 where it is used of grafting) so that it can give birth to the youth's \\"living flowers,\\" self-generated new copies. Interpretation of the sonnet is said to hinge on the third quatrain (lines 9-12), which is generally regarded as obscure. Edmond Malone suggested that \\"lines of life\\" refers to children, with a pun on line as bloodline. This reading was accepted by Edward Dowden and others. Also, \\"repair\\" can mean to make anew or newly father (re + p√®re), which may be relevant. But as well, \\"lines of life\\" can mean the length of life, or the fate-lines found on the hand and face read by fortune-tellers. An artistic metaphor also arises in this sonnet, and \\"lines\\" can be read in this context. Line 10 is the source of some dissent amongst scholars. One reading is that, compared to his physical offspring (‚Äúthis‚Äù), the depictions of time's pencil or the poet's novice pen (\\"pupil\\") are ineffectual. But it is the potential insight into the sonnets' chronology, through the relationship of \\"this\\" to \\"Time's pencil\\" and \\"my pupil pen\\", that is the focus of the debate: George Steevens regards the words as evidence Shakespeare wrote his sonnets as a youth; for T. W. Baldwin the phrase connects this sonnet to The Rape of Lucrece. While in general terms \\"Time\\" is in this line a form of artist (rather than a destroyer, as elsewhere in the cycle), its exact function is unclear. In Shakespeare's time, a pencil was both a small painter's brush and a tool to engrave letters, although graphite pencils bound in wax, string or even wood were known in the 16th century. Following William Empson, Stephen Booth points out that all of the potential readings of the disputed lines, in particular the third quatrain, are potentially accurate: while the lines do not establish a single meaning, the reader understands in general terms the usual theme, the contrast between artistic and genealogical immortality. The assertion is that procreation is a more viable route to immortality than the \\"counterfeit\\" of art. The sonnet concludes with resignation that the efforts of both time and the poet to depict the youth's beauty cannot bring the youth to life (\\"can make you live\\") in the eyes of men (compare the claim in Sonnet 81, line 8, \\"When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie\\"). By giving himself away in sexual union, or in marriage (\\"give away your self\\") the youth will paradoxically continue to preserve himself (\\"keeps your self still\\"). Continuing both the metaphor of pencils and lines, as well as the fatherly metaphor and that of fortune, the youth's lineage must be delineated (\\"drawn\\") by his own creative skill (\\"your own sweet skill\\").

Staley, Edgcumbe, The dogaressas of Venice, The wives of the doges, London, T. W.

Its attribution to the whole household and to the prior Participazio doges (Agnello Giustiniano (827‚Äì829), Giovanni I (829‚Äì836), Orso I (864‚Äì881) and Giovanni II (881‚Äì887) was established by 19th century scholars. Pozza, Marco, Patriciaco Agnello, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 81, 2014 According to some historians Agnello was elected,Norwich J. J., A History of Venice, p. 13.Romanin S.,Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, p. 156 while others say that he was appointed by Arsaphios, a Byzantine envoy.Nichol. D. M., Byzantium and Venice: A Study in Diplomatic and Cultural Relations, 2008, pp. 16-19 Dogeship With the attempt of Pepin, the king of Italy and son of the emperor Charlemagne, to invade the Lagoon of Venice, the co-doges Obelerio, Beato, and Valentino degli Antenori fled the duchy of Venetia. After Pepin withdrew, Agnello was elected to the dogeship. He moved the ducal seat from Malamocco to Rivolato. He built the first doge's palace near the old church of San Teodoro. The location was (and still is) where St. Marks Square is now.Romanin S., Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, p. 157 It was like a castle to defend him more from possible internal enemies than external ones. It burned down when it was set alight during a rebellion against the doge Pietro IV Candiano (959-76).Norwich, J. J., A History of Venice, pp. 42-43Bertolini, Margherita Giuliana, Candiano, Pietro, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 17 (1974) Pepin's attempt to invade the duchy of Venetia led the Carolingian and the Byzantine empires to agree the Peace of Aachen in 812, which was ratified in 814. In this the duchy of Venetia remained under the Byzantines. Its protection against enemies form the mainland was guaranteed. Its boundaries with the Kingdom of Italy were defined. Its rights to sail freely in the Adriatic Sea were recognised. Agnello sent his elder son, Giustiniano, on a mission to Constantinople. While Giustiniano was away, he appointed his other son Giovanni as co-doge. Giustiniano was enraged. He refused to go to the palace and went to live at the nearby church of San Severo. He managed to change his father‚Äôs mind. Giustiniano and his young son Agnello were raised to the co- dogeship. Giovanni was demoted and exiled to Zara (Zadar). He escaped and went to Dalmatia. He then went to Bergamo and put himself under the protection of the emperor Louis II of Italy. Agnello and Giustiniano sent envoys to the emperor to ask for Giovanni to be handed over. The emperor agreed and extradited Giovanni. He was sent to Constantinople with his wife.Norwich J. J., A History of Venice, pp. 17-18.Romanin S.,Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, p. 158-59 Later, in 820, the young Agnello was sent to Constantinople for the occasion of the coronation of Michael II, the new Byzantine emperor. He died while he was there. The dogeships of Giovanni Galbaio (787‚Äì804) and Obelerio degli Antenori (804-811) had been marred by a bitter conflict between a pro-Byzantine faction and a pro-Frankish one, which caused great instability and contributed to Pepin's attempted invasion. Fortunato, the patriarch of Grado, was pro-Frankish and a key player in this conflict. Agnello deposed him to avoid further troubles. Fortunato fled to France. Agnello replaced him with Giovanni, the abbot of San Servolo. One of Agnello's first priorities was to repopulate the places Pepin had ravaged: Chioggia and Albiola. As he was originally form Heraclea, which had been destroyed by his predecessor and by Pepin, he had it rebuilt and renamed Cittanova (New City). He had the church of San Pellegrino, which had been demolished by the inhabitants of Grado during Pepin's attack, rebuilt.Romanin S.,Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, p. 156 Agnello took measures to coordinate the development of Rivoalto. He put Nicol√≤ Ardisonio in charge of fortifying the lidi (Lido and Pelletrina, the outlying islands of the lagoon) against the sea, also placing Lorenzo Alimpato in charge of land reclamation and Pietro Tradonico of the construction of new buildings.Romanin S.,Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, pp. 156-57 This was the beginning of the Rivolato group of islands developing into the city of Venice. Agnello founded monasteries on the islands of Barnaba and San Giuliano and provided priests with good supplies for the maintenance and decoration of churches wherever this was needed. He and his son Giovanni donated land on their properties in San Illario to the monks on the island of San Servolo.Romanin S., Storia Documentata Di Venezia, Vol. 3, pp. 150-61 The Byzantine emperor Leo V the Armenian sent the relics of St. Zachary, paid for the construction of a monastery and church of San Zaccaria dedicated to this saint and sent architects to build it.

Hammock creates atmospheric music by combining orchestral arrangements with electronic beats, piano and droning guitar. Hammock have released 10 albums and five EPs since 2005, mostly on their own label, Hammock Music, which is distributed through Redeye, and have garnered favorable reviews from critics, including Pitchfork and AllMusic. History Hammock was formed as a collaboration between guitarists Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson, both formerly of alternative rock band Common Children, that developed out of informal recording sessions between songwriting projects. Byrd and Thompson initially had no intention of releasing their studio efforts. After building up a collection of almost 40 songs, however, they changed their minds. In December 2005, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Hammock Artist of the Year on their 2005 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame list. Hammock gave their first live performance at a private event at Chuck Dodson's Gallery@404B in Hot Springs, Arkansas on August 3, 2007, to honor J√≥nsi & Alex, the artistic collaboration between J√≥n √û√≥r (J√≥nsi) Birgisson (lead singer and guitarist of Sigur R√≥s) and Alex Somers (graphic designer and member of the band Parachutes), on the night of their United States premier, which was also their first-ever exhibition outside of Iceland. This performance eventually became the inspiration for Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow (featuring artwork by J√≥nsi & Alex), which was recorded live in its entirety, save for a few overdubs. In 2008, Hammock performed at the Wordless Music Series in New York City with Stars of the Lid. In May 2010, Hammock released their fifth full-length album, Chasing After Shadows...Living with the Ghosts. That December, Hammock released their fourth EP, Longest Year, a beatless and wordless mini-album that was born out of the difficulty the band faced in 2010, including the near-total destruction of Byrd's home in the epic 2010 Nashville flood. Over the next few years, Hammock expanded their musical horizons with a variety of collaborations and the addition of more of an orchestral aspect to their music. Hammock collaborated with singer-songwriter Matthew Ryan on the single \\"Like New Year's Day\\", released on January 1, 2011. On March 8, 2011, the band issued a cover of Catherine Wheel's \\"Black Metallic\\" as a digital single, featuring vocals by Byrd's wife, Christine Glass (the couple had previously collaborated as a duo, GlassByrd). On October 5, 2011, they released a four-song collaboration EP with Steve Kilbey and Tim Powles of the Church called Asleep in the Downlights. On July 6, 2012, Hammock announced that mastering had started for their sixth LP and first double album, Departure Songs. It was released on October 2, 2012. On May 10, 2013, they announced that they had begun mixing a new record, Oblivion Hymns. The album was released on November 26, 2013, and was a notable departure from their previously guitar-focused sound, adding a neoclassical element with a full orchestra, children's choir, and vocals from Timothy Showalter (Strand of Oaks). On July 1, 2014, Hammock reissued their fully ambient 2005 album The Sleep-Over Series (Volume 1), following it up with a sequel, The Sleepover Series, Volume 2, on September 23, 2014. Hammock's ninth album, Everything and Nothing, was released on April 1, 2016. Irish music and politics magazine Hot Press said in its review that the album is \\"the aural equivalent of a flotation tank... an album to lose yourself in completely\\". Haydon Spenceley, reviewing for Drowned in Sound, stated that the album has \\"clarity, purpose, drivenness, even, not words that would necessarily be associated with this stellar band's earlier work... This is music of transcendent beauty, but with an added level of dissonance that grabs the attention in a way that hasn't ever seemed to be Hammock's stock in trade before\\". Spenceley also claimed that Everything and Nothing is Hammock's \\"most immediate, most sonorous and beautiful album to date\\". On November 29, 2016, Hammock announced on their Twitter page that they were in the process of recording a new album, with Slow Meadow guesting. On June 21, 2017, Hammock announced via their Facebook page that their 10th album, Mysterium, would be released on August 25, 2017. They also released a video of the first single, \\"Things of Beauty Burn\\". In 2017, Hammock composed the score for Kogonada's critically acclaimed film Columbus, which premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. In 2018, Hammock released the follow-up to 2017's Mysterium with the full-length Universalis. Other projects Since 2005, Byrd has occasionally recorded as a member of the band the Choir. Hammock guested on the track \\"Melting the Frozen Sea Within Us\\" by Amman/Josh, which appeared on that band's 2010 EP Places. Hammock collaborated with Matthew Perryman Jones in 2013 on the song \\"Unknown\\", released as part of the Nashville Indie Spotlight 2014 compilation album. Building on their 2011 collaboration with Matthew Ryan, Hammock announced a side project named the Summer Kills in March 2018. After seven years of work, the trio's first album, Last Night We Became Swans (mixed by Peter Katis) was released on April 27, 2018.https://www.thesummerkills.com/about/ Discography =Studio albums= * Kenotic (2005, Hammock Music; reissued digitally 2015 with session outtakes) * The Sleepover Series, Volume One (2005, Hammock Music; reissued 2014) * Raising Your Voice...Trying to Stop an Echo (2006, Darla Records; reissued 2011, Hammock Music) * Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow (2008, Darla Records; reissued 2013, Hammock Music) * Chasing After Shadows...

Overview Rhamphosuchus crassidens jaws An 1868 illustration of specimens of R. crassidens (top and center) compared to other crocodylian fossils from the Sewalik Hills Traditionally, many palaeontologists estimated that it was one of the largest, if not the largest crocodylian that ever lived, reaching an estimated length of . However, a more recent study suggests that the animal may have been 8‚Äì11 m (26 to 36 ft) in length, and therefore is not the largest known crocodylian. Another crocodylian, Purussaurus, from the Miocene of Peru and Brazil, is known from an equally incomplete fossil set. It is estimated to have been similar in length to the initial estimates at approximately 12 m (about 40ft). However, this would mean that it would have been somewhat larger in size if the more recent size estimates for Rhamphosuchus are correct. If the most recent estimate is correct, then several other extinct crocodylians also surpassed Rhamphosuchus in length, such as the Late Cretaceous alligatoroid Deinosuchus, the Early Cretaceous pholidosaurid Sarcosuchus, the Miocene gavialid Gryposuchus and the strange planktivorous Mourasuchus (a contemporary of Purussaurus), at 12 m, 9.5 m, 10.15 m, and 12 m, respectively.

Lifford Bridge (in Irish Droichead Leifear) is a cross- border bridge on the A38 connecting with the N15, spanning the River Foyle which marks the border between Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and Lifford in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. It remains a vital part of the trans-border route from the North, West and East of County Donegal, to Dublin via County Tyrone. History Lifford came into the possession of Sir Richard Hansard during the Plantation of Ulster in 1607. One of the conditions of his grant was that a ferry crossing be provided over the River Finn. This service continued until 1730 when the first bridge linking Lifford and Strabane was built. In the 19th century a curious custom existed when if, by the end of the Assizes in Lifford Courthouse or Omagh Courthouse, a jury could not reach a unanimous verdict in a case, they were sent to the \\"verge\\" of the county to be dismissed. In the case of counties Donegal and Tyrone, this was the middle of the Lifford Bridge. The present bridge was constructed by engineering company Farrans in 1964, jointly funded by Donegal County Council and the old Tyrone County Council. Strabane District Council took over the functions of Tyrone County Council in part of West Tyrone in 1973. The overall length of the bridge is 115m. In 2005 it carried some 16,000 vehicles a day. During The Troubles in 1968, an attempt was made to blow the bridge up. However, it was closed for only a short time. In 2005 refurbishment of the bridge took place and included upgrading the parapet railings, installation of safety kerbing and railings, resurfacing of the carriageway deck and footways, upgrading streetlights. Over ¬£400,000 was spent on the project.

It is known by a number of common names, including common meadow violet, purple violet, the lesbian flower,https://www.bbg.org/news/weed_of_the_month_common_blue_violet woolly blue violet, hooded violet, and wood violet. Its cultivar 'Albiflora' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Self-seeding freely, in lawns and gardens it can be considered a weed by some. Cleistogamous seed heads may also appear on short stems in late summer and early autumn. Taxonomy Hairless common blue violets with purple flowers and bearded spurred petals have been variously called Viola sororia, V. affinis, and V. pratincola. In the Chicago region, this hairless form is most frequently found in weedy areas such as old fields and lawns. Hairy purple violets with blue flowers have been called \\"true\\" Viola sororia and are rarely seen outside of remnant wooded areas. A form with white flowers that have a purple center has been called Viola sororia fo. priceana (Confederate violet). Viola sororia has several named hybrids: *Viola √ó bernardii (Viola pedaifida var. pedatifida √ó sororia) *Viola √ó bissellii (Viola cucullata √ó sororia) *Viola √ó cordifolia (Viola hirsutula √ó sororia) *Viola √ó conjugens (Viola sagittata var. sagittata √ó sororia) *Viola √ó insolita (Viola pedatifida var. brittoniana √ó sororia) Uses Beyond its use as a common lawn and garden plant, Viola sororia has historically been used for food and for medicine. The flowers and leaves are edible, and some sources suggest the roots can also be eaten. The Cherokee used it to treat colds and headaches. Rafinesque, in his Medical Flora, a Manual of the Medical Botany of the United States of North America (1828 ‚Äì 1830), wrote of Viola sororia being used by his American contemporaries for coughs, sore throats, and constipation. The leaves are high in vitamins A and C and can be eaten raw. The flowers have been made into jelly and candy. Ecology The caterpillars of fritillary butterflies feed on these plants. The plants also serve as food for wild turkeys, rabbits, deer, livestock, the mourning dove, the bobwhite, and the white-footed mouse.

It was so named because it split from the Republican Party over the issues of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy) and bimetallism. The main Republican Party supported the gold standard. Silver Republican strength was concentrated in the Western states where silver mining was an important industry. A leading spokesman in the House of Representatives was Willis Sweet of Idaho. Silver Republicans were elected to the Congress from several Western states. In 1896, Silver Republicans supported Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan over William McKinley.

This highly flattened creature mainly fed on fish, which it captured with its wide jaws lined with needle-like teeth. Metoposaurus was up to 3 m (10 feet) long and weighed about 450 kg (1,000 pounds). Many Metoposaurus mass graves have been found, probably from creatures that grouped together in drying pools during drought.  Discovery and species  Upper side of M. diagnosticus skull = Discovery = The earliest mention of Metoposauridae dates back to 1842 when Von Meyer described the dorsal view of the skull roof of a labyrinthodont from the Keuper Schilfsandstein of Feuerbacher Haide near Stuttgart. Later, Meyer attempted a reconstruction of the same specimen and named it Metopias diagnosticus. However, Lydekker later renamed the species as Metoposaurus diagnosticus in 1890 because the name Metopias was already in use.Chowdhury, T.R. 1965. A new metoposaurid amphibian from the Upper Triassic Maleri Formation of Central India. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B 250, 1‚Äì52. = Species = Restoration of Metoposaurus krasiejowensis Based on the position of the lacrimal in the skull, Metoposauridae is divided into two lineages. The group with the lacrimal external to the orbit includes Koskinonodon bakeri, Dutuitosaurus ouazzoui, Arganasaurus lyazidi, and Apachesaurus gregorii. They show a tendency towards a decreasing depth of the otic notch and a decrease in body size. Metoposaurus diagnosticus, Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis and Panthasaurus maleriensis fall in the category of the lacrimal forming the orbital margin. * Metoposaurus diagnosticus (Meyer, 1842) Fossils were found among other locations in the Gres √† Avicula contorta Formation of France, the Weser Formation of Germany and the Raibl Formation of Italy. The species has an anterior top of the lacrimal closer to the nares than the top of the prefrontal; interclavicle with posterior part longer than in Panthasaurus maleriensis.Meyer, E. 1842. Labyrinthodonten‚àíGenera. Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Mineralogie, Geographie, Geologie, Pal√§ontologie 1842,301‚Äì304.

Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis from Poland * Metoposaurus krasiejowensis (Sulej, 2002) Fossils were found in the Drawno Beds Formation of Poland. The species has a very short perineal part of the parietal with the high value of the expansion angle of the sutures separating partially from the supratemporal (mean angle value of 21.81). Some skulls possess a large quadrate foramen and small paraquadrate foramen. * Metoposaurus algarvensis (Brusatte et al. 2015) From the Late Triassic Gr√®s de Silves Formation in the Algarve, Portugal.

Description  Size comparison with a human = Skull =  Lacrimal  The lacrimal contacts the nasal medially, the maxilla laterally, the prefrontal posteromedially, and the jugal posteriorly. Metoposaur taxonomy was based on the position of the lacrimal bone, and differing opinions have been published. According to a photograph published by Hunt (1993), it is noted that the lacrimal enters the orbit, contrary to the previous finding by Fraas (1889). According to Lucas, close examination of the skull and other metoposaur skulls does not support this claim, and it has been noted that the misidentification was possibly due to the poor preservation of the fossil.Lucas, S.G. and Spielmann, J.A., eds., 2007, The Global Triassic. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 41. In 2007, Sulej noted that the variability in the position of the lacrimal is narrow enough to be used for phylogenic analysis, but with caution.  Parietal  A study conducted by Sulej (2007) shows that the parietal contacts the frontal anteriorly, the postfrontal anterolaterally, the supratemporal laterally, and the postparietal posteriorly. The pineal foramen is in the posterior region of the parietal. An interesting feature pointed out by Sulej on examining the skull of Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis is that it has a shorter prepineal region of the parietal than Metoposaurus diagnosticus diagnosticus and the expansion angle of the suture separating the parietal from the supratemporal has a lower value.  Maxilla  Underside of skull The maxilla forms a large, completely dentigerous shelf bearing 83 to 107 teeth. The first teeth are large, and tooth size decreases markedly further posteriorly. On the ventral side, the maxilla contacts the ectopterygoid, palatine and vomer. In the choanal region, the maxilla is slightly broadening medially on the palatal side where it borders the choana. The margin of the choana is variable. In most skulls, it is weakly distinguished and rounded, but in a few cases it is more solid and sharply outlined. palaeontologia.pan.pl/PP64/Sulej.pdf = Vertebral column = Half of a M. diagnosticus skeleton, showing vertebrae and ribs According to Sulej (2007), the intercentra of cervical and thoracic vertebra are fully ossified. The pleurocentra are not preserved and no evidence is found that they were present as cartilages. The atlas, axis, and third and fourth cervical vertebrae are characteristic and similar to those in other stereospondyls. The morphology of the atlas, axis, and third and fourth vertebrae suggests that the neck of Metoposaurus was relatively flexible. The intercentra of the region where the vertebral column contacts the shoulder girdle are flat anteriorly and posteriorly. The neural arches have almost vertically set prezygapophyses (vide postcervical vertebrae). This suggests that in this region the lateral bending of the vertebral column was very limited. It was probably connected through articulation of the vertebral column with the shoulder girdle. A stiffening of the vertebral column, in the region of contacting limbs, was apparently essential for swimming. He also describes that in Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis, the parapophyses become shorter posteriorly, similarly to plagiosaurids. The intercentra of dorsal and sacral vertebrae are fully ossified and form quite short disks, not connected with the neural arches. In the dorsal and sacral region, they have anterior and posterior surfaces that are concave, or the posterior surface is almost flat. This condition resembles that in the trunk of plesiosaurs and, to some degree, the ichthyosaurs, confirming the aquatic mode of life.  Geography and history  Metoposaurids are known from the early Late Triassic (Carnian) Keuper of Germany and Austria. There have also been unconfirmed notifications reported from Madagascar (Dutuit 1978) and China (Yang 1978).Dutuit, J.M.1978.

Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejoviensis is the most abundant metoposaurid amphibian of the Krasiej√≥w site (the species name comes from the site) located in southern Poland.Barycka, Ewa. \\"Morphology and ontogeny of the humerus of the Triassic temnospondyl amphibian Metoposaurus diagnosticus.\\" Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, Abhandlungen 243.3 (2007): 351-361. Among stereospondyls, metoposaurs seem to have been one of the latest survivors. However, a variety of other temnospondyl lines carried into the Jurassic, the latest of which was another stereospondyl, the chigutisaurid Koolasuchus, discovered in modern-day Australia, where it was supported by a colder mid-Cretaceous climate.  Paleobiology  = Locomotion = Digital reconstruction of Metoposaurus under water. Examination of the vertebral column and limb articulations of Metoposaurus suggests that they used their limbs as flippers and swam by making simultaneous and symmetrical limb movements similar to plesiosaurs. A recent study conducted in Poland suggests that the broad, flat head and arm bones, wide hands, and large tail of Metoposaurus diagnosticus are significant characteristics which led the researchers to conclude that they swam in ephemeral lakes during the wet season and used their heads and forearms to burrow under the ground when the dry season began. The study found that the medullary region is filled with well-developed trabecular bone. The growth marks in all bones are organized as thick layers of highly vascularized zones and thick compact annuli with numerous rest lines, which may correspond with favorably wet and long, unfavorably dry seasons.Konietzko-Meier, Dorota, and Nicole Klein. \\"Unique growth pattern of Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis (Amphibia, Temnospondyli) from the Upper Triassic of Krasiej√≥w, Poland.\\" Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 370 (2013): 145-157. = Predators = The exact predators of Metoposaurus are unknown, but phytosaurs were found closely associated in bone beds.Mateus, O., Butler R.

The current Chief Executive is Ken Muir. The GTCS maintains a register of qualified teachers; there were 73,306 teachers on the register on 1 May 2016.  History  GTCS was the first professional registration body for teachers in the United Kingdom, and one of the first teaching councils in the world. It was set up in 1965 under the Teaching Council (Scotland) Act 1965 following concerns that entry requirements had lowered after the Second World War and unqualified teachers were working in Scottish schools. Its powers, remits and duties have since been amended by other legislation, including the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 and the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000. It is a legal requirement for all teachers working in Scottish local council schools to be registered with GTCS (The Requirements for Teachers (Scotland) Regulations 2005). On 2 April 2012 GTCS was granted independence status by the Scottish Government. The Teaching Council (Scotland) Act 1965 was repealed and replaced by the Public Services Reform (GTC Scotland) Order 2011. The Public Services Reform (General Teaching Council for Scotland) Order 2011 was made by Scottish Ministers in accordance with the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 and passed into law on 17 March 2011.  Proposed reform  In June 2017 Scottish the Scottish Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, John Swinney, announced plans to reform the General Teaching Council for Scotland, bringing it together with other professional development bodies in a new Education Workforce Council for Scotland, similar to the Education Workforce Council in Wales. Although described as independent, half of the Welsh EWC members are directly appointed through the Welsh Government public appointments system. The Scottish Government intended to establish the Education Workforce Council for Scotland (EWCS), which it proposed would replace and take on the responsibilities of the GTCS, the Community Learning and Development Standards Council and register others working in education. Details were published in the Scottish Government's Empowering Schools consultation on a planned Education Bill in November 2017. However, this proposed Bill was put aside on 26 June 2018 with the Scottish Government instead publishing a joint agreement with Scottish Local Authorities on school empowerment and collaboration. The Educational Institute of Scotland, the dominant teaching union, said in a statement in June 2017 that: \\"We remain to be convinced about the need for potential changes to the General Teaching Council, a world renowned teacher-led body which ensures the highest professional standards are maintained.\\" The EIS view is that the plans \\"risk putting years of progress on teacher professionalism into reverse\\". The Scottish Secondary Teachers‚Äô Association (SSTA) also voiced opposition saying it would be \\"a retrograde step\\". The GTCS published its response to Empowering Schools on 1 February 2018 stating its strong opposition to the establishment of the EWCS. The GTCS response stated: \\"...there is no evidence-based rationale for replacing GTCS, with its strong brand and highly-regarded national and international reputation, with a new body\\". John Swinney stated in the Scottish Parliament on 26 June 2018 that he accepted the ‚Äústrength of feeling‚Äù in the sector to keep the GTCS. The GTCS accepted Swinney had responded to concerns raised by teachers and the \\"comprehensive opposition to this proposal in the consultation returns\\". The GTCS said it would continue to work closely with Scottish Government \\"to consider how a wider range of educational professionals most directly involved in teaching might be registered with GTCS\\". The EIS said it had \\"vehemently opposed\\" the proposal to abolish the GTCS and welcomed \\"the fact that the Scottish Government has listened to the voice of the teaching profession on this very important issue\\".  Functions  The Public Services Reform (General Teaching Council for Scotland) Order 2011 describes the GTCS's general functions. The main ones are to keep a register of teachers qualified to teach in Scottish schools and to establish and review the standards of education and training appropriate to teachers. The GTCS's general functions also include: * the standards of conduct and professional competence expected of a registered teacher; * investigating the fitness to teach of registered teachers; * to keep itself informed of courses for the education and training of teachers; * to make recommendations to Scottish Ministers on teachers‚Äô education, training, career development and the supply of teachers (with some exceptions); * to keep registers of other individuals working in educational settings as it thinks fit. =Standards of education and training= A suite of Professional Standards provides a framework for teachers at all stages in their careers. A revised set of standards came into use in August 2013. Professional Update was launched 18 August 2014. The Standard for Provisional Registration (SPR) and The Standard for Full Registration (SFR) are part of the overall set of GTC Scotland's Professional Standards which also includes The Standard for Career- Long Professional Learning and The Standards for Leadership and Management. The GTCS rules around the subjects that Scottish teachers are allowed to teach have been criticised for being too strict because they constrain the ability of head teachers to determine the curriculum in schools and prevent experienced teachers who qualified outside Scotland from being able to take up teaching posts.  Governing Council and committee structure  = Role of the council = The council has a significant role to play in shaping the teaching profession of Scotland and maintaining and improving professional standards. It does this by developing and monitoring the strategic direction and policy of GTCS by determining entry standards to teaching, accrediting courses of teacher education and by setting clear expectations of the profession in its range of published Codes and Professional Standards. = Council membership = GTCS is governed by a Council made up of 19 elected teachers, 11 nominated educational stakeholder representatives and 7 appointed lay members, who make decisions on matters of strategy and policy. Council membership is determined following a rolling programme: election, nomination and appointments processes take place every two years and half of the members step down at the end of each two-year period. = Committee Structure = Council members may serve on the following committees and sub-committees: * Executive Committee: advises, informs and puts forward recommendations or proposals to Council on all aspects shaping the strategic and policy direction of the council. * Regulatory Governance Sub-Committee: advises, informs and puts forward recommendations or proposals to the Executive Committee on all rules, guidance and policies relating to the council's panels. * Education Committee: advises, informs and puts forward recommendations or proposals to council on all educational matters within the council's remit. * Finance and General Purposes Committee: advises, informs and puts forward recommendations or proposals to council on GTCS's annual report and accounts, financial matters (including the setting of registration fees) and ensure that GTCS acts legally and within its statutory authority. = Adjudication panels, appointments and appeals = The council has a series of panels that investigate and adjudicate cases about fitness to teach and registration of individual teachers. The panels consist solely of registrants and lay persons who are independent from the council and who are appointed by the Appointments Committee. The Appointments Committee and the Appeals Board also consist solely of appointed registrants and lay persons who are independent from the council.  Supporting education in Scotland  GTCS performs a number of functions to support and inform the teaching profession and the wider public about Scottish education. It produces Teaching Scotland magazine. This publication carries a range of news articles and features about education activities across the Scotland and is issued to teachers on the GTCS register. In addition to this, GTCS holds a number of events throughout the year to promote and recognise the teaching profession. This includes, among many other activities, its Annual Lecture. The Lecture has previously been given by Annie Lennox, Lord David Puttnam, Christopher Brookmyre, Baroness Warnock and Sir Harry Burns amongst others. GTCS operates a number of web-based resources providing information about education in Scotland including Teacher Journey and in2teaching (a website for probationers).

The estate was purchased by Leeds Corporation in 1898, and the 18th century Killingbeck Hall was the starting building for Killingbeck hospital, which was closed in 1997, the Hall itself having been demolished in 1978. Killingbeck colliery was south of the York Road and the railway line in what is now Primrose Valley Park, Halton.  Population  Killingbeck had a population of 6,436 in 2011.Killingbeck is made up of 21 output areas South of Seacroft http://ukcensusdata.com/killingbeck-and-seacroft-e0007153#sthash.LbB3FW5y.dpbs General description The area is small and its borders difficult to define but runs along York Road, east of Wykebeck Valley Road. From this junction north of York Road is a large area of fields and woodland, Killingbeck Fields, which is a Local Nature Reserve. Immediately east of this is Killingbeck Retail Park (including an Asda superstore)and Acorn business park. On the south side of the York Road up to this point is housing which is in the LS14 postcode, and also in the electoral ward. To the east of the retail park is Oak Tree Lane, which leads to the newest housing development on the site of the former Killingbeck Hospital. To the east of this is Killingbeck Cemetery, which was established in 1895 for the Roman Catholic community of Leeds. To the east of this is older housing developments, on Lyme Chase, and The Oval estate, which occupy the land up to Foundry Road. There is a row of shops on the north side leading up to this junction. On the south side is Seacroft Hospital. Beyond Foundry Lane are Killingbeck Police Station and Killingbeck Fire Station, leading to the Parklands housing estate which may be considered part of Seacroft.

The Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments of 1932‚Äì1934 (also known as the World Disarmament Conference or the Geneva Disarmament Conference) was a failed effort by member states of the League of Nations, together with the United States, to accomplish disarmament. It took place in the city of Geneva, Switzerland, from 1932 to 1934.Philip John Noel-Baker, First World Disarmament Conference and Why It Failed (1979)  Background  The first effort at international arms limitation was made at the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, which had failed in their primary objective. Although many contemporary commentators and Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles blamed the outbreak of the First World War on the war guilt of Germany, historians writing in the 1930s began to emphasize the quick arms race preceding 1914. Also, all the major powers except the United States had committed themselves to disarmament in both the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. A substantial international nongovernmental campaign to promote disarmament also developed in the 1920s and the early 1930s. A preparatory commission was initiated by the League in 1925. By 1931, there was sufficient support to hold a conference, which duly began under the chairmanship of former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. The motivation behind the talks can be summed up by an extract from the message that US President Franklin Roosevelt sent to the conference: \\"If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure.\\"United States Department of State, Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy 1931-1941 (United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1943) pp. 10 The League's failure to ensure the success of the talks impacted the likelihood of a second major European conflict.  Negotiations  The talks were beset by a number of difficulties from the outset. Germany immediately demanded to be allowed military equality or it would leave. However, the French were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from a future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. Britain and the US were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France requested in exchange for limitation of French armaments. After ten months of negotiations, France, Britain and Italy announced that Germany and the other states disarmed by the Versailles Treaty should be insured equality in a system that give security to all nations.\\" Davies, 2004. The parties could not agree on what constituted \\"offensive\\" and \\"defensive\\" weapons. The talks broke down, and Hitler withdrew Germany from both the Conference and the League of Nations on the 14th of October 1933. The 1930s had proved far too self-interested an international period to accommodate multilateral action in favour of peace.Frederick L. Schuman, Europe On The Eve 1933-1939 (1939) pp 28-54. online.

Burton is a graduate of the University of San Francisco School of Law. Life and career 1977 Congressional photo of Burton. Burton earned a BA degree in social science in 1954 from San Francisco State University and was the University's Alumnus of the Year in 1998. From 1998 until he was forced out of office by term limits in 2004, he served as the President pro tempore of the State Senate. Prior to his time in the Senate, he served in the California State Assembly from 1965-74, and again from 1988-96. He was originally elected to the Assembly to succeed his brother, Phillip, who had been elected to Congress. Burton was returned to the Assembly in a 1988 special election to succeed Art Agnos, who had been elected Mayor of San Francisco. Burton also served in the U.S. House of Representatives, alongside his brother, from 1974-82, when he resigned. As a legislator, Burton was known for expanding the Cal Grant scholarship program, and passing a law (subsequently defeated in a referendum) that would have required California businesses to pay for health coverage for their workers. The magazine California Journal said about Burton's departure from the Senate in 2005: \\"Gone will be the Senate's most vehement partisan for social services for the poor, the Senate's angriest voice against tax breaks for businesses and the wealthy, its loudest voice for protection of workers, its fiercest pro-labor advocate and its disciplinarian.\\" After leaving the Senate, Burton formed the John Burton Foundation, an organization that, according to its web site, is \\"dedicated to improving the quality of life for California‚Äôs homeless children and developing policy solutions to prevent homelessness.\\" In February 2007 he was appointed board member of the University of Phoenix. On April 26, 2009, Burton was elected chair of the California Democratic Party, succeeding Arthur Torres. He received roughly 76% of the vote, over his sole challenger, Chris Finnie of Santa Cruz. Burton stepped down as Chairman of the California Democratic Party in May 2017. He was succeeded by Vice Chairman Eric Bauman. At his farewell, he was reported to have punctuated his comments with profanity-laced tirades on President Donald Trump and others in front of such influential lawmakers as Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Tom Perez, and Gavin Newsom.\\"California Democrats say farewell to party leader John Burton.

It was first discovered in 1963 in the Red Beds Formation in the Qacha's Nek Province of Lesotho, southern Africa.

Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 20 Aug. 2009. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. The finding is significant since some of the characteristics found on this specimen were believed to be absent until Jurassic.  Description  Orthosuchus has a body proportion similar to lizards, with a body length about 0.6 meters, and a flattened skull, a typical skull of crocodilian.Diane, Nash S. \\"The Morphology and Relationships of a Crocodilian, Orthosuchus Stormbergi, from the Upper Triassic of Lesotho.\\" Annals of the South African Museum 67 (1975): 227-329. Biodiversity Heritage Library. Web. 5 Mar. 2017. The external skull surface is covered randomly with small pits. The orbits are huge, with a complete dorsal roof made by the paired supraorbitals. The maxilla has sharp edge, which extends forward and covers some part of the lateral notch. The ears are protected by earflaps, which prevent water inflow to the otic recess when this animal is in water.Shute, C. C. D. and Bellairs, A. d'A. (1955), The external ear in Crocodilia. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 124: 741‚Äì749. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7998.1955.tb07813.x The fossil resembles some features of a primitive crocodilian, one of them is the reduced antorbital fenestra. The quadratojugal is the backbone of the skull, which connects to the jugal and quadrate. The flattened head shape of Orthosuchus is made by the posterior quadrate contact, which is below the rear end of the squamosal. This form is a typical archosaurian characteristic that had lost in modern crocodiles, and also absent in teleosaurs. It developed a short secondary bony palate, with crocodilian featuring pterygoids. The elongated choana is located behind the secondary palate, which is made by the premaxilla and maxilla. In modern crocodiles, the choana is between the vomers and the anterior processes of pterygoids. The dentary forms the largest part of the lower jaw with some shallow pits, which indicated that the animal probably has 15-18 teeth, fewer teeth in the far back. The teeth are equal in size and similar in shape. Orthosuchus has 24 vertebrae, and 8 of them are believed to be in the cervical region. All vertebrae appear to be amphicoelous. It does not have tall neural spine but the height of them decrease from head to tail. The vertebrae in the neck region are tightly bonded together. The ribs start at the twelfth vertebra, which supports the ilium. The tail consists of 8 vertebrae of different size and shape. The first one is in contact with the sacral ribs, three vertebrae at the far end of the tail are tiny in size, and the other four vertebrae form the middle of the tail. The ribs form antero-ventral and postero-dorsal flanges, which are for the muscle attachments. Orthosuchus has similar pectoral girdles and pelvic girdles compare to living crocodiles, with a long scapula and a shorter coracoid. The interclavicle is hypothesized to be cartilaginous. As for the forelimb, the fossil records showed that Orthosuchus has similar humerus, but the distal and proximal expansions does not lay on the same plane as the modern crocodiles. Also, not like the living crocodiles, the ulna and radius of Orthosuchus, or other typical archosaurs, are around 88% of the length of the humerus, while the radius and ulna in modern crocodiles are the shortest elements in the forelimb. It has two non-elongated carpals, with one of the elliptical shape. Orthosuchus appeared to have 5 digits. The first digit is the shortest and the fifth digit is the weakest. Although some of the phalanges are missing, it is believed that the phalanges formula is 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3. The femur is thought to be the longest bone. The tibia is more developed than the fibula, and they are 94% of the length of the femur. Taking all the bones into account, the forelimb is 91% the length of the hind limb. Orthosuchus has similar astragalus and calcaneum. Compared to the astragalus, the rectangular shaped calcaneum is small in size and forms a prominent tuber.  Discovery  The first fossil materials were collected by an expedition of South African Museum in April 1963 led by Alfred W. Crompton. The materials were collected from the Lower Jurassic Red Bed Formation (= Upper Elliot Formation) of the Stormberg, so that as soon as they found out that the fossils belongs to a new crocodilian species, they named the species Orthosuchus Stormbergi in a paper published by Nash 1968. They also found a smaller skull that also belongs to Orthosuchus Stormbergi at the same horizon but in a different place at the same site. The main part of the skull and the law jaw was well preserved, but some of the phalanges, ribs, and one side of the pelvic girdle with its hind limb were missing. Since the specimens had some distortions, major issues were fix at the site before it was X-rayed. In 1931, a new primitive form of crocodilian was found in the Dinosaur Canyon Beds of northern Arizona, United States. The beds are at the top of the Upper Triassic Formation and below the Lower Jurassic sediments. The crocodilian found is about 1 meter long, with flattened head and large frontals. Its more advanced transverse process indicates that it is a new crocodilian species. In 1933 Barnum Brown named it Archaeosuchus, and then changed it to Protosuchus in 1934 and form the family of Protosuchidae.Colbert, Edwin Harris 1905-, Charles Craig 1887-1966. Mook, and Barnum. Brown. \\"The Ancestral Crocodilian Protosuchus. Bulletin of the AMNH ; v. 97, Article 3.\\" AMNH Library Digital Repository. New York : [American Museum of Natural History], 01 Jan. 1970. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. The classification of Protosuchidae is debatable, however, since Orthosuchus resemble some of the characteristics of Protosuchidae, it is believed to be in the part of this family. Phylogeny of Crocodylomorpha  Classification  Modern crocodiles are considered within the group archosaurs, which also include birds, dinosaurs, and crocodilians.Benton, Michael J., and JAMES M. Clark. \\"Archosaur phylogeny and the relationships of the Crocodylia.\\" The phylogeny and classification of the tetrapods 1 (1988): 295-338. However, from appearance, archosaurs resemble more of crocodiles than of birds.Clark, JAMES M. \\"Patterns of evolution in Mesozoic Crocodyliformes.\\" In the shadow of the dinosaurs: early Mesozoic tetrapods (1994): 84-97. Orthosuchus resembles a primitive form of crocodilian by some of its traits: the fusion midline together at the parietal, the form of the secondary palate, the fusion of pterygoid and quadrate, the extension of coracoid, radius, and ulna, and the form of tuber on the calcaneum. Orthosuchus is closely related to Protosuchus, Notochampsa, Erythochampsa, and probably other crocodilian families. Although Orthosuchus could be grouped into Notochampsa, more people want to keep the family Protosuchidae because it is widely accepted.  Paleobiology  The existing specimens of Orthosuchus were found in the Lower Jurassic Red Bed Formation in South Africa in 1963. It was hypothesized that Orthosuchus lived main on terrestrial land, but some key factors contribute to the fact that it is spent the time mostly in water. The first notable evident is on the palate, which was covered by soft tissues, not bone. The choanae are on the back of the palate and a valve was used to help close the glottis. These features help Orthosuchus keep breathing when submerging in the aquatic system. The ears are protected by earflaps, which prevent water inflow to the otic recess when this animal is in water. Modern crocodiles also have earflaps to decreasing water entry. The shape of the skull, especially the snout, is similar to an Indian gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, who prey on small fish. It is possible that Orthosuchus has the same predation, by slowly move toward schools of small fish and swallow from the side. The aquatic environment provides plenty of food for the animal, besides small fish, the animal could also feed on lake invertebrates. Orthosuchus has a small salt-secreting gland, which indicates that it is not a marine animal. And because the pubis articulates with the front region of the ischium, it is believed to be a basal animal that lived in swamps and lakes.Claessens, Leon P. A. M. \\"Archosaurian Respiration and the Pelvic Girdle Aspiration Breathing of Crocodyliforms.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences. The Royal Society, 22 July 2004. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. The animal is probably quadrupedal because the fore limbs are approximately 91% the length of the hind limb, which also makes the walking on land easier. Unlike modern crocodiles, Orthosuchus does not creep on its belly; it probably walks at a high position with its femur vertical to the ground. According to Parrish, primitive crocodylomorph did not have a crawling stance because it was more used to the terrestrial environment.Parrish, J.M. (1987) ‚ÄòThe origin of crocodilian locomotion‚Äô, Paleobiology, 13(4), pp. 396‚Äì414. doi: 10.1017/S0094837300009003.

History A constable of the Birmingham City Police in 1891. The custodian helmet is the headgear traditionally worn by male police constables and sergeants while on foot patrol in England and Wales. Officers of all ranks in most forces are also issued a flat, peaked cap that is worn on mobile patrol in a vehicle. Ranks above sergeant wear the peaked cap only. However, some Inspectors wear the Custodian Helmet, but with two silver bands around the base (to match the two pips worn as rank insignia) to denote their position.https://www.gwra.co.uk/auctions/british-transport-police-inspectors- helmet-marked-2016nov-0371.html Claimed by some sources to have been based on the spiked pickelhaube worn by the Prussian Army,Major R. M. Barnes, p. 257, \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army, First Sphere Books, 1972. it was first adopted by the London Metropolitan Police in 1863 to replace the \\"stovepipe\\" top hat worn since 1829. In 1863, the Metropolitan Police replaced the previous uniform of white trousers, swallow-tailed coat and top hat in favour of very dark blue trousers, a more modern button up tunic and the early type of helmet which had an upturned brim at the front and a raised spine at the back, running from the bottom to the top of the helmet, which became known as the \\"cockscomb\\". Glasgow Police in 1919. These helmets are no longer in use in Scotland. The early Metropolitan Police helmet had a \\"garter\\" style badge on the front of the helmet which had the officer's personal number and divisional letter in the centre, backed by a leather insert. This was surrounded by a wreath design which had the words \\"Metropolitan Police\\" around the outside and was topped with the reigning monarch's crown. This style changed in 1875, when an early version of the Brunswick star was adopted without the upturned brim seen in the previous style. There was much variety in the style of helmets during this period. The form of the helmets gradually converged with the \\"foreign service\\" and \\"home service\\" helmets adopted by the British Army in the late-1870s. During the 1930s, the Home Office attempted to standardise the design of the helmets with the \\"Home Office Pattern\\", after it became evident that since the Metropolitan Police had adopted it and produced their own badge, many small county and borough police forces followed suit and individually adopted their own style badges and designs, which led to many different styles and designs. Some forces adopted the helmet without any badge, others designed their own, usually with the county's arms or crest in the centre. One force adopted an Australian style bush hat and one wore a helmet constructed of straw. The \\"Home Office Pattern\\" consisted of a helmet with the Brunswick star badge (commonly known as a \\"helmet plate\\") which would feature the reigning monarch's cipher, with the name of the force imprinted on the plate. The top of the helmet had a \\"rose top\\", which was a raised metal rose, largely used as an ornament to cover the ventilation hole. However, this standardisation process was largely unsuccessful, with many different designs being worn by today's police forces nationally. Until the 1970s, and in certain areas the 1980s, the helmet internally had only a sweat band to allow it to sit correctly on the wearer's head, with a single chin strap. The helmet plate and either a \\"cockscomb\\" or \\"rose top\\" fixed to the top of the helmet, were fitted by pressing the metal lugs attached to the badges through the helmet and then having small matchstick-size pieces of wood pushed through the lugs to secure them. Other helmet furniture included a \\"ball top\\" and in some cases a \\"spike top\\". A constable of the left During the 1970s and 1980s, before specially adapted riot helmets were introduced, officers were expected to conduct public order and crowd control in the standard beat duty helmet. The cork construction provided little protection against attack and thrown missiles. In order to provide more protection, the construction of the helmets changed. Visually they remained the same, but instead of being constructed of cork they were now made out of a very hard-wearing plastic material and covered in felt. Internally they were padded with foam fitted into the shell of the helmet with a webbing-style harness to allow it to sit on the head in the correct manner. Two chin straps were added at this time, a thin leather strap for normal duties, and a \\"public order strap\\" which was made of thick material and included a chin-cup to securely hold the helmet on the head. As well as these changes, helmet plates were altered so that the fixings on them were no longer lugs, but were prong-type pins which were inserted into the helmet and spread apart, so that if the helmet plate was hit by a missile, the lugs would not cause injury to the wearer. Although NATO riot helmets replaced the Custodians for public order, Custodian helmets are still currently used to control football crowds, and protests. As late as 2011 police used Custodian helmets for public order as riot gear was not available, for example during the London Riots in 2011 where the British Transport Police and Metropolitan Police were equipped only with Custodian helmets, shields and batons. All police forces in England and Wales have their own \\"helmet plates\\" attached to the front of the helmet, most of which feature the county's coat of arms/crest or \\"EIIR\\" (the royal cypher of Queen Elizabeth II) in the centre. Also, most helmet plates now feature parts with coloured enamel, such as the force name or crest. Adding enamel to helmet plates has only been done since around 1985, most forces before this had plain metal ones with no or little colour. Some forces also used \\"night plates\\" for unobtrusive use at night-time, usually darkened apart from the centre, instead of metal \\"day plates\\". This practice had almost completely ceased by 1973. Police forces in the UK did not issue custodian helmets to Special Constables up until around 1995; however those forces retaining the helmet now issue them to all male officers. The traditional cork construction often led CID personnel to call their uniformed colleagues \\"woodentops\\" (the name of a children's TV programme). The equivalent for female officers is a \\"bowler\\" hat, which still affords the same protection as the male custodian. Police Community Support Officers only wear peaked caps, which have a blue or grey band on them rather than the police officer's Sillitoe Tartan to distinguish them from police officers. Phasing out and reintroduction Male and female Metropolitan Police officers in London, 2007. Of the 43 Home Office territorial forces in England and Wales, 20 currently use the comb style, eighteen use the rosetop style, and four use the ball style. Some forces wore spikes on top of the helmet, although these have now been completely phased out. Since the 1950s, helmets have no longer been worn by police officers in Scotland, but may be seen worn by uniformed Metropolitan Police officers when on Royal duties in Scotland. They ceased to be worn in Northern Ireland after the 1920s, except for night patrol work in Belfast and Derry until the early 1960s. In 2001 residents of Southend called for Essex Police to bring back the white custodian helmet formerly worn by Southend-on- Sea Borough Police officers patrolling the seaside in the summer, but this was rejected by the force. During 2002, attempts were made by police forces in England to replace the custodian helmet. Some forces adopted baseball caps for a very short time and almost all reverted to the helmet or peaked cap. Humberside Police have tried and adopted a \\"squat\\" helmet which was considerably shorter than the normal size helmets. This is currently in use. Thames Valley Police discarded the helmet in 2009 due to budget constraints but brought them back for use in 2018 following a successful trial in Reading, whereas West Yorkshire Police have announced that helmets will cease to be worn after 2015 because staff find them unsuitable for normal duties. West Yorkshire Police will, however, retain the helmets for use on ceremonial occasions. Lancashire, Cheshire and Gloucestershire Constabularies announced in February 2017 that as part of uniform changes their custodian, bowler and peaked caps were to be replaced by unisex reinforced baseball caps, known as \\"Bump Caps\\". A small number of the traditional headdresses will be retained for ceremonial occasions.Lancestor Guardian, 8 February 2017 In 2006/7 Gwent Police and North Wales Police replaced all headgear in favour of baseball caps. In 2010/12 the two forces announced that peaked caps and helmets would return as baseball caps were seen as unprofessional and difficult for the public to see and recognise as police headgear. This change to revert to wearing helmets led to all forces in Wales to continue wearing the custodian helmet. Greater Manchester Police attempted to phase out custodian helmets around 2011/12 in favour of peaked caps. A few months later the custodian helmet was brought back and peaked caps are no longer issued to officers below the rank of Inspector. This means that the custodian is the only headgear worn by constables and sergeants. However, since 2017 peaked caps and custodian helmets have both been issued for use on patrol. In 2017, Northamptonshire Police announced they would replace the helmet with Gender Neutral Caps but after 18 months the helmets were brought back into use. Of the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales, 39 are currently using the custodian helmet. Description Crest-type custodian helmet, with the 233x233px White colonial custodian helmet worn by actors portraying left Both chin straps can be folded up inside the helmet when not in use, for more strenuous activity. Most officers choose not to use the chin strap for day-to-day duties. All forces except the City of London Police, Hampshire Constabulary and West Mercia Police use the Brunswick star as the basis for their helmet plate. The helmet worn by members of the Isle of Man Constabulary is white, rather than blue, and officers of the States of Jersey Police on duty in St Helier wear white helmets during the summer months. Production In modern production, hat makers take approximately 30 minutes to complete a single custodian helmet, all of which are made by only four companies: Hobson and Sons (London) Ltd; Christys, of Stockport; Compton Webb (C.W. Headdress Limited), of Oxfordshire; and Helmets Limited, of Wheathampstead. The initial process begins with the making of the helmet shell using a vacuum forming machine and a metal mould. A sheet of black fortified plastic is heated and then lowered over the mould, where a vacuum pulls the plastic into shape over the mould. Once hardened instantly, a rubber mallet is used to release the plastic from the mould so that the excess plastic around the brim of the helmet can be trimmed with a bandsaw and sanded. The helmet's fabric covers are made out of water-repellent wool that are cut in halves and stitched together to give the helmet a distinctive centred, front-to-back seam. Moving down the line of production, glue is applied to both the inside of the fabric cover and the outside surface of the helmet shell, the fabric cover is then steamed and stretched tightly over the shell to prevent buckling. A wooden tool is carefully used to smooth away any air bubbles as well as to ensure the fabric cover is in full contact with the helmet shell; excess fabric is cut away. Now halfway through production, the helmet is left to dry for several minutes. Once it is dry, black plastic piping is sewn around the brim of the helmet to reinforce it and give it a neater edge. For rosetop and ball helmet styles, the metal fastening prongs or screws of the chrome fixtures are dipped in chalk to mark their positions on the crown of the helmet; holes are then drilled and the fixture is secured. For comb-style helmets, the crest, which has vent holes incorporated into the design, is also fixed by prongs or simply glued into place at the top end of the comb. For all helmet styles, two vent holes are punched on both sides of the helmet and fitted with black metal grommets, making a total of four vent holes. The adjustable head harness is made out of strips of fabric tape and foam stitched onto a plastic headband; this is then inverted so that a modern-pattern chin-strap assembly and traditional leather chin-strip can be stitched on as well. The harness assembly is lowered into the helmet and secured with an industrial stapler. Depending on the helmet style, a broad plastic band, narrow black metal band, narrow chrome metal band, or broad chrome metal band is wrapped around the helmet and pinned down, concealing the staples. For additional protection, a sponge liner is tucked into the helmet.Metro Toronto Police mounted officer, now only used by members of Toronto Police Chief's Ceremonial Unit.326x326px Near the end of production, a hole is drilled on the front end of the helmet and an appropriate police helmet plate is screwed on. The helmet then is sized, cleaned, and inspected. At last, the helmet is labelled and given a good brush to bring up the pile. It is then now finally ready to be shipped on to an awaiting police force. Use in the Commonwealth Helmets closely following the British model were widely worn by the police forces of Canada, Australia and New Zealand from the late nineteenth century on. These were eventually discarded as being inconvenient to wear when in vehicles or providing insufficient protection from the sun when on foot patrol. The New Zealand Police retained a white version until the 1990s. The same helmet was used by the Samoa police, who still make limited use of it. The Toronto Police Service retains the white helmet for use by the Toronto Police Chief's Ceremonial Unit. The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary currently uses the helmet for some officers (usually senior) and for special events. As well as in the UK, other forces currently using the custodian helmet include the States of Jersey Police, States of Guernsey Police Service, Isle of Man Constabulary, Royal Gibraltar Police, and Bermuda Police. The term \\"custodian\\" originated as a specific make of helmet used in Britain in the late-twentieth century. Because of this, \\"custodian\\" was never an official or unofficial name for similar helmets worn in other parts of the Commonwealth. Use in countries outside the Commonwealth Certain Italian municipal police forces use a white custodian-style helmet, particularly in open air duties, such as when directing traffic. The Monegasque Prince's Carabiniers Company use a white helmet in summer and a blue one in winter. The Portuguese Public Security Police (PSP) constables wore a custodian-style helmet from 1936 to 1958. The helmets were made of cork, covered with dark blue fabric, having on the front a silver PSP star (six points star with the Portuguese Shield in the centre). The police constables serving as traffic guards () wore a similar helmet in cork covered with white fabric for use in the summer and in aluminum painted white for use in the winter. While the general police constables' blue helmets ceased to be used, the white traffic guards' helmets continued to be used and become traditional. These helmets are still worn by the rare traffic guards that remain in the PSP of today. Jordanian police officers in some assignments wear a custodian cover topped with a spike and incorporating a cloth shade for the back of the neck. = Past uses in these countries = Until the mid-20th century, British-style helmets were in use with the municipal police forces of several Dutch cities, most notably The Hague. Some early uniforms in the United States police forcesh had variants of a helmet. The Pennsylvania State Police incorporated a cloth covered helmet, manufactured in England. The New York Police Department used a helmet, grey for summer and blue for winter from 1880 to 1912, as did several other American police forces. The helmet features in the Keystone Kops films. Several photographs exist that show a funeral procession for a fallen officer (John (Jack) L. Briscoe) in Stockton, California. Briscoe was killed in the line of duty on 5 February 1917.John L. Briscoe (ODMP) Reviewed May 19, 2014. Some of the line officers in the procession wore a modified custodian helmet with a leather band just above the rim and a silver badge on the front.

It did this by also opening the Texas Legations in London and Paris. Their opening is believed by some academics to be less an attempt by Texas to enter the international stage as an independent country and more a maneuver to prompt officials in the United States to worry that an independent Texas might allow British and French soldiers to mass on the southern border of the U.S. When Texas sought to join the United States in 1845, the British Empire supported keeping it independent. The British even offered to guarantee Texas's borders with both the United States and Mexico. Texas was a tactical ally of Britain acting as a counterweight to the United States. Nonetheless an independent Texas was probably inviable for financial reasons, and when the Republic became a state in 1845 the legations were shut down. Locations London The Texas Legation in London was located in Pickering Place, an alley off the east side of St. James's Street near St. James's Palace in a building that also houses Berry Bros. & Rudd, a prestigious wine merchants' firm that has been at that site since 1730. On the north side of the building is a plaque marking it as the site of the legation. At the top of the plaque is the seal of the Republic of Texas. The text of the plaque reads: \\"Texas Legation In this building was the legation for the ministers from the Republic of Texas to the Court of St. James 1842 - 1845. Erected by the Anglo-Texan Society\\". The plaque was erected in 1963. Anglo-Texan Society member Alfred Bossom led the effort to erect the plaque and the honour of its unveiling went to then-Governor Price Daniel. Paris The Texas Legation in Paris was located not far from the Tuileries Palace at 1 Place Vend√¥me 75001, where there is today a carving on the wall above the H√¥tel Bataille de Franc√®s that indicates where the legation used to be. Washington, D.C. The Texas Legation in Washington, D.C. moved frequently, occupying eight different locations during its short history. One of these locations, a Pennsylvania Avenue boarding house, sat on or near the grounds of the United States Navy Memorial. Another location is occupied by a building that has hosted the Washington office of the University of Texas System.Benning, Tom. \\"Republic of Texas diplomats are honored in Paris and London.

As well as Landywood, the station also serves the adjacent villages of Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley (The former Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay railway station closed in the 1960s). The LNWR also operated an earlier halt at Landywood which closed on 1 January 1916. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Railway. History The first station on the site was opened in 1908 by the London and North Western Railway but closed after a short life in 1916. The present station opened in 1989, as part of the first stage of the reopening by British Rail of the Chase Line from Walsall to Hednesford to passenger trains. The area was previously served by a station further north at Great Wyrley, but this was closed during the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. In 2010, the stations between Walsall and Stafford (including Landywood) were subject to a ¬£1.6 million upgrade project. This included the installation of new lighting, CCTV, live train information boards, and new waiting shelters.http://www.europeanrailwayreview.com/rail- industry-news/work-starts-on-1-6-million-upgrade-to-chase-line-stations From 2018, Great Wyrley & Cheslyn Hay Community Group will help maintain the station as part of West Midland Railway's station adoption scheme. In 2019 the Chase Line electrification works were completed and the first electric trains will run from 19 May. This was to coincide with a major timetable change introducing hourly services to London Euston via Birmingham International. London bound trains are run by the London Northwestern franchise. From May 2020, London services will run at peak times only, with the remainder terminating at Birmingham International or Coventry. This is unfortunately due to timetable issues along the line causing delays and cancellations. Services Typically, Monday to Saturday daytimes and peak times, Landywood is served by two trains per hour in each direction between Birmingham New Street and Rugeley Trent Valley where connections to Stafford, Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe are available. On Sundays Landywood is served by 1 train per hour.GB eNRT 2015‚Äì16 Edition, Table 70 (Network Rail) Services are usually operated by Class 350 electric trains. Journey times are typically 14 minutes to Walsall and 38 minutes to Birmingham New Street.

At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1988. Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief. Shape found a readership based on that formula. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.

Biography Douglas Kennedy was born in New York City in 1955, the son of a commodities broker and a production assistant at NBC. He was educated at The Collegiate School and graduated with a B.A. magna cum laude from Bowdoin College in 1976. He also spent a year studying at Trinity College Dublin. \\"I was a history major,\\" Kennedy explained. \\"Retrospectively, I think the history major provides much better training for a novelist. So much of what I do in my own fiction is observational; is looking at behavior. By studying human history you really see how human folly endlessly repeats itself. In my work‚Äîin whatever form it takes‚ÄîI am very much grappling with what it means to be American in this way.\\" In 1977, he returned to Dublin and started a co- operative theatre company with a friend. He was later hired to run the Abbey Theatre's second house, The Peacock. He also co-produced the 1983 Irish drama film Attracta starring Wendy Hiller.Film Details: Attracta, Trinity College Dublin website, https://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=56704 At the age of 28, he resigned from The Peacock to write full-time. After several radio plays for the BBC and one stage play, he decided to switch directions and wrote his first book, a narrative account of his travels in Egypt called Beyond the Pyramids, which was published in 1988. Kennedy and his then-wife moved to London that year, where Kennedy expanded his journalistic work, and wrote for The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Listener, the New Statesman, and the British editions of Esquire and GQ. Kennedy is the author of twelve novels, including the international bestsellers The Big Picture, The Pursuit of Happiness, Leaving the World and The Moment. His latest novel, The Heat of Betrayal, was published by Random House UK on 23 April 2015 and in France by Belfond as Mirage on 7 May 2015, with an American publication in February 2016, under the title The Blue Hour by Atria (a division of Simon and Schuster). He is also the author of three highly praised travel books. More than 14 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide and his work has been translated into twenty-two languages. Kennedy's novels are often written in European landscapes, and have been particularly acclaimed and beloved in France; his novel, Five Days, published by Atria in April 2013 and by Belfond in October 2013, became a #1 Bestseller in France, as did his earlier novels, The Moment and Leaving the World. Kennedy received the French decoration Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2007. In November 2009, he received the first ‚ÄúGrand Prix du Figaro,‚Äù awarded by the newspaper Le Figaro. Kennedy has two children, Max and Amelia. He divides his time between London, Paris, Berlin, Montreal, Maine and New York. Kennedy is an atheist.\\"Now I'm a pretty hardened atheist - not to mention something of a metropolitan sceptic - but I do appreciate the human need to believe that, behind life's important happenstantial events, there is a larger meaning. And even if we don't buy the \\"controlling hand of God\\", we often try to console ourselves with the \\"to everything a purpose\\" theory of chance. This is especially true in instances of random calamity.\\" Douglas Kennedy, 'The Hand of Fate', The Independent (London), April 28, 2001, Features, p. 30-33.

Her disappearance and murder sparked a media frenzy, with the ensuing investigation and court case being one of the most closely followed in South African history. Kidnapping and murder Matthews was born on 8 July 1983 to Rob and Sharon Matthews. She had one sibling, her sister Karen. At the time of her murder, the family lived in the Johannesburg suburb of Fourways and Matthews was studying for a BCom Finance degree at Bond University in the Johannesburg suburb of Morningside. Her 21st birthday party was planned for the day after she disappeared. On Friday 9 July 2004, she was abducted from the parking lot at Bond University. Shortly after the kidnapping, a ransom demand was made to her father, who dropped off R50,000 near the Grasmere Toll Plaza south of Johannesburg. He was able to hold a short telephone conversation with her afterwards which was their last communication. On 21 July 2004, her body was discovered by a municipal worker cutting grass in the open veld next to the R82 highway in Walkerville, south of Johannesburg. She had been shot four times. Although she was found naked, she had not been sexually assaulted. Investigation and legal proceedings On 24 August 2004, police detective Superintendent Piet Byleveld took over the investigation. He identified 24-year-old Donovan Moodley as his prime suspect. Moodley was also a student at Bond University attended by Matthews, but was not acquainted with her. On 4 October 2004, Byleveld arrested Moodley outside his home in Alberton. Moodley appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on charges of murder, kidnapping and extortion. On 25 July 2005, he pleaded guilty to all three charges in the Johannesburg High Court. Judge Joop Labuschagne found him guilty as charged, but ruled he had not acted alone in his judgement. Moodley was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, 15 years for kidnapping and 10 years for extortion. He began serving his life sentence on 4 August 2005. In his initial version of events, Moodley said he was driven by a need for money. He said he approached Matthews in the campus parking lot and asked her for a lift. They rode in her car together, where he then kidnapped her. Moodley said shortly after he extorted the R50,000 from her father he was unsure what to do with her, and then took her to a deserted field in Walkerville and shot her in the back of the head. He then burned his clothes to hide evidence. Friends and family of Matthews wore white ribbons during the trial. =Appeals= Less than two weeks after sentencing, Moodley informed the Johannesburg High Court he wished to file an application for leave to appeal his sentence. He now claimed he did not kill Matthews and was framed. He withdrew this original application on 18 November 2005. In 2006, he claimed he had not acted alone in the murder and had been framed. On 25 November 2009, another application filed in the Johannesburg High Court for leave to appeal his sentence was dismissed by Judge Joop Labuschagne. On 25 May 2010, his sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court of Appeal. On 4 August 2010, an application filed in the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal his sentence was dismissed unanimously by then Chief Justice Sandile Ngcobo and the other ten judges of the Constitutional Court. On 1 February 2012, an application filed in the Johannesburg High Court for his conviction to be set aside or a retrial was dismissed by Judge Joop Labuschagne. =Ongoing investigation= Piet Byleveld, the investigating officer who arrested Moodley, retired from the South African Police Service in 2010. His statement was never presented to court as Moodley pleaded guilty. He said he believed Moodley had accomplices in his biography published in 2011. A new investigating officer was appointed to the case in 2011.

One of the reasons was that the United Kingdom had begun the process of abolishing capital punishment in 1965, with the last two executions carried out in 1964 and final abolition completed in 1998. The Governor of Hong Kong would as a matter of course commute the sentences of those convicted under the death penalty to life imprisonment under the Royal prerogative of mercy. In April 1993, capital punishment was officially abolished in Hong Kong. Since then, life imprisonment has been the most severe punishment in Hong Kong.

It stood about 70 cm (2 ft 4 in) tall and was very similar to a modern heron in shape. The species is known from rather fragmentary fossils in the area of Quercy, France; dated remains are from Pech Desse, a Late Oligocene locality, but the original fossil, a single right tarsometatarsus (MNHN QU-15720), isn't precisely dated and may have come from deposits as early as Late Eocene in age. Proardea was apparently closely related to the true herons and egrets (Ardeinae). As these genera are only known from the Miocene onwards, Proardea possibly was a direct ancestor of today's herons and/or egrets. However, the Miocene genus Proardeola is closely related, or perhaps even synonymous, with Proardea; the former's single species Proardeola walkeri may thus be Proardea walkeri or even identical with P. amissa. The bird described as Ardea aurelianensis may also be identical with P. amissa, which would in that case become known as Proardea aurelianensis. Supposed other species of Proardea, P. perplexa and P. similis, are synonyms of the ibis Geronticus perplexus and the phasianid Miogallus altus, respectively.

The buildings were razed at the beginning of the 19th century. The only remaining part is the 10th-century crypt, which was rediscovered in 1960, and which contains the tomb of Saint Martial, the first bishop of Limoges, and also that of Saint Valerie of Limoges, another, possibly legendary, early martyr. Origins The origins of the abbey lie in the graveyard outside the original Roman settlement of Augustoritum. This is the site of the Place de la R√©publique, at the commercial heart of modern Limoges. The cemetery was the reputed burial place of early Christian martyrs, including Saint Martial, the first bishop of Limoges. This evolved into a place of pilgrimage in Merovingian times. By the 6th century, according to Gregory of Tours, there was a funerary chapel above Saint Martial's tomb, in the care of a small community of clerics, who were recognised as a congregation of canons in the reign of the Carolingian ruler, Louis the Pious (814-840). This community became a Benedictine abbey in 848, under Charles the Bald. A mosaic above the tomb of Saint Martial dates from approximately this time, and is set in hard cement from an earlier period, indicating that the shrine was already well- established and of some antiquity by the time the abbey was founded. History The abbey grew in importance and elaboration, alongside the \\"City of the Castle\\". This was a major commercial centre, under the patronage of the abbot, and outside the boundaries and control of the Cathedral City, dominated by the bishop. The body of Saint Martial was, at some time in the late 9th century, taken from its sarcophagus and placed for a time in a golden shrine in the great new church which was built over the spot. Here it was a magnet for pilgrims on the Way of St. James, benefiting from the wider pilgrim traffic throughout Western Europe. The abbey reached the peak of its importance in the century following its take-over by Cluny Abbey in 1065, when it was famed for its literature and music. However, the shrine was stolen by Henry II of England, who was also the Duke of Aquitaine. Turmoil in the land was interpreted as the saint's response to the disturbance of his bones. The body was reburied and an altar placed above it. The disturbances of the 12th century were followed by a period of rebuilding and a century of renewed prosperity. However, they had been only a foretaste of the destruction and disruption of the Hundred Years' War. The Limousin was not spared in the dynastic and religious conflicts of the 16th and 17th centuries. The abbey went through a protracted decline and it never recovered the greatness of its heyday. There was considerable rebuilding and repair in the early 18th century. However, in 1791, during the French Revolution, the abbey community was dissolved, and in the following year the sacking and demolition of the building began. By 1807 this was complete. The area was levelled and turned into a new public space, the Place de la R√©publique. Portions of the relics of the martyrs, allegedly saved by faithful Catholic citizens of Limoges, were rehoused in the nearby church of St. Michel des Lions. The twin Castle and Cathedral cities were at last unified into a single municipality under secular governance. Excavations were carried out from 1960, on the initiative of the city council, in the hope of uncovering the remains of the abbey and the shrine of Saint Martial. By 1962, the crypt containing the tombs of Saints Martial and Valerie had been rediscovered. Excavations were then pushed further to the east, revealing more church buildings belonging to the abbey. From 1966, the crypt with the surrounding area was consolidated and opened to the public, the whole being covered with a large concrete slab. Today, it is entered down a flight of steps from the Place de la R√©publique above. Admission is free. Excavations started again in July 2015 to carry out detailed studies of the remains before revamping of the Place de la Republique. Music The abbey was the center of several important developments in medieval music, including liturgical chant, early polyphony and troubadours' songs. The first chant manuscripts show revisions of the early 11th century, when Roger de Chabannes introduced his nephew Ad√©mar as cantor and scriptor of notation.James Grier (2005). A significant body of plainchant and tonaries for its modal classification had been written at the scriptorium of this Abbey (among them Pa 909, 1120, 1121, 1132, 1240). Ad√©mar de Chabannes composed not only sequences and prosulae, but also music for a festal octave for the Patron St Martial.Offices for the principal feast of Martial (30 June) and the Octave (7 July) can be found in an antiphonary and a troper of Limoges (Pa 1085, ff. 76v-77r, for the Octave ff. 77v-78r and Pa 1240, ff. 96r-97r), there is also a troped mass notated by Ad√©mar himself (Pa 1121, ff. 28v-32v). He engaged in vain for the recognition of St Martial as an apostle, which was the only condition to celebrate the patron a whole week long.See James Grier (2003, 2006). Among the earliest sequences composed there is the Swan Sequence from c.850 (Pa 1139). The St. Martial school of music and its library contributed and collected an almost complete repertoire of West Frankish tropes and sequences, as well as the so-called Aquitanian polyphony (Pa 1139, 3549, 3719), because cantors of the region had been most inventive in quite original compositions, dealing with all kinds of troped poetry, and two part settings between discant and florid organum. It is a famous site for 12th century sacred and secular church music. Some of the earliest troubadour lyrics with their accompanying melodies were extant in manuscripts at St. Martial's, now preserved at the Biblioth√®que Nationale.

Origins Founded in 1956, the first issue of 16 hit the newsstands in May 1957, with Elvis Presley on the cover.Moser, Margaret. \\"Gloria Stavers, '16 Magazine,' and the roots of rock journalism\\". Austin Chronicle (November 30, 2007). However, its longtime editor-in-chief, former fashion model and subscriptions clerk Gloria Stavers, transformed 16 from a standard general-interest movie magazine into a major fan magazine focused on the preteen female as its primary reader base. Stavers was editor from 1958 until 1975. She chose to cater to that particular demographic because of the many fan letters she had read from girls aged nine through 12 writing to popular celebrities in care of the magazine, and she remembered how she felt at that age Moser, Margaret. \\"The Singer Not the Song,\\" Weekly Wire (June 14, 1999). and developed a formula to increase readership in that demographic. Content 16s covers attracted readers by featuring sensational and hyperbole-laden headlines such as \\"The Day He Almost DIED!\\", head shots of various male entertainers, and very whimsical artwork. Although the articles were printed on newsprint, 16 featured colorful, glossy pin-up poster art. Prior to the 1970s, most of the pin-ups of the celebrities were kept clean-cut, but 16 began to increasingly sexualize the posters they featured, in keeping with the more permissive times. 16 Magazine also often offered contests that would award the winner an opportunity to have a \\"meet and greet\\" with their favorite performer. Most of the articles and features tended to lean on the lighter side. Rather than asking the artist serious questions about musical influences and social issues, it would offer the readers interviews asking a celebrity about his favorite color or meal, or would have him describe his \\"ideal girl\\" or dream date. If he was married, in a long term relationship, or not heterosexual in orientation, that information was kept out of the magazine, as was any news about the celebrity that even hinted at scandal. Stavers also attempted to expand the perception of teen idols by featuring such unlikely candidates as Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy and shock rock pioneer Alice Cooper. In 1997, in honor of its 40th year of publication, former 16 Magazine editors Randi Reisfeld and music critic Danny Fields published the commemorative book \\"Who's Your Fave Rave?\\", a retrospective of 16 and a biography on its long-time editor styled to resemble an issue of the magazine. There was also an accompanying CD of the same name, featuring many of the pop acts promoted in the magazine throughout the years. No-advertising policy Despite the lack of serious journalistic content and fierce competition from Tiger Beat and other celebrity magazines, 16 remained the top-selling teen celebrity magazine for many years. For at least 30 years of its publication, 16 Magazine was entirely self-supporting. In 2001, 16 became part of Primedia's Teen Magazines groups and is considered a monthly \\"specials\\" issue focusing on a specific topic or act. Despite this, no regular or special issue of 16 Magazine was seen or published since, including online. By this time, newer teen magazines had taken over, such as J14, M Magazine, Popstar! Magazine, and the resurrected Tiger Beat. Celebrities featured and promoted in 16 Magazine =1950s= In the 1950s, some of the teen idols featured in the pages of 16 Magazine included Elvis Presley, Paul Anka, Dion, and Mousketeer Annette Funicello. =1960s= During the 1960s, 16 Magazine introduced its readers to a variety of rock and roll/pop music acts, referred to by the editor and readers as \\"Faves\\". Some of those acts include The Beatles, Herman's Hermits, Paul Revere and the Raiders, The Monkees, The Cowsills, Jim Morrison, and The Doors. The appearance of the \\"faves\\" was highly selective. Some acts such as The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys received very little coverage in comparison to other bands, and many of the popular Motown acts were virtually ignored. =1970s= In the 1970s, 16 began focusing primarily on bubblegum and pop acts, such as the Osmond Brothers (with particular emphasis on Donny Osmond), David Cassidy, Bobby Sherman, The Bay City Rollers, Rick Springfield, Jack Wild, Kiss and others. Female celebrities on its covers was also rare, but from time to time, a female star such as Susan Dey, Peggy Lipton, Maureen McCormick, or Karen Carpenter might write the occasional beauty or dating advice column. =1980s and beyond= During the 1980s and well into the 1990s, 16 continued to serve up one \\"boy band\\" after another, from new wave artists like Duran Duran to N'Sync. However, Destiny's Child broke the racial and gender barrier when they appeared on the cover.

It first opened on July 22, 1966, and has variously operated under the names Altamont Speedway, Altamont Raceway, Altamont Motorsports Park, Altamont Raceway Park and Arena, and Bernal Memorial Raceway. The speedway closed in October 2008.R.I.P. Altamont Raceway Description Diagram of Altamont Raceway Park. The Raceway Park contained a variety of different racetrack configurations including a 1/2 mile oval, 1/4 mile oval, road course, and a figure 8 track. The course was the state's largest oval racetrack north of Los Angeles. The track featured a pit lane that was uncharacteristic when compared to larger ovals for the weekly events. The pit lane was located on the outside of the course on the opposite side of the oval from the start finish line. However, during Grand National West races, the pit lane was moved to the 1/4 mile oval so as to be inside the larger oval, as is customary for most oval tracks, since live pit stops are used during the higher-level NASCAR-sanctioned race. History The park is well known for its December 6, 1969, hosting of the notorious and ill-fated Altamont Free Concert, featuring Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and The Rolling Stones. Many people were beaten by members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, who were hired to provide security for the stage. During the Stones' set, Meredith Hunter, a concert- goer high on methamphetamine and brandishing his revolver, was stabbed to death by a Hells Angels member in front of the stage as the band played. The death was captured on film and appears in the 1970 documentary Gimme Shelter. In 2004, the track appeared in an episode of the popular Discovery Channel show MythBusters. In the episode, the show's hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage used the track to test the myth that a car will have better fuel mileage with the air conditioner on and windows closed than it would with all of the windows down. In 2006, the park came under the ownership of Riverside Motorsports Park, LLC. They initiated several upgrades to the park including fresh asphalt, the addition of the road course and the new Figure 8 track. Altamont staged a variety of motorsports events, including NASCAR Whelen All- American Series raced weekly as the schedule permitted for the California State and Whelen National Championships. The park also played host to a race on the NASCAR Camping World West Series schedule, the Dan Gamel RV Centers 200 in the fall. Additionally, Formula 4, Sprint Cars, Motorcycle races and the 24 Hours of LeMons were held at the racetrack, the latter being a play on the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, in the place of top dollar racing machines, the 24 Hours of LeMons features cars with a maximum price of $500 (excluding safety gear, brakes, and tires), hence the title 'lemons'.

In these cases, the number of teeth is fewer if the anomalous tooth is counted as one tooth. In geminated teeth, division is usually incomplete and results in a large tooth crown that has a single root and a single canal.

The secessionist movement was led by wealthy landowners who opposed early reforms by the nation's first leader, Emperor Pedro I. The fight occurred in Pernambuco, Cear√° and Para√≠ba.  Background of the rebellion  The dissolution of the Brazilian Constituent Assembly in 1823 was well received in Pernambuco. The two greatest liberal leaders in the province, Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade and Joaquim do Amor Divino Rabelo e Caneca (popularly known as \\"Frei Caneca\\") supported it and blamed the Bonifacians for the act.Dohlnikoff, Miriam.

The province was governed by Paes Barreto, who was appointed President by Pedro I, in accordance with the law promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on October 20, 1823 (and that would be later kept by the Constitution).Vianna, H√©lio.

Although Recife (or to be more precise, the Liberals) had clearly rebelled, Pedro I tried to prevent a conflict that he considered unnecessary and appointed a new president the province, Jos√© Carlos Mayrink da Silva Ferr√£o. Mayrink was natural of the province of Minas Gerais, but was related to the Liberals and it could act as a neutral entity to conciliate the two local factions. However, the Liberals did not accept Mayrink, which made him return to Rio de Janeiro. The rumors of a great Portuguese naval attack (Brazil was still in war for its independence) compelled John Taylor to leave Recife.Vianna, H√©lio.

S√£o Paulo: Melhoramentos, 1994, p. 433  The rebellion  On July 2, 1824, only one day after the departure of Taylor, Manuel Paes de Andrade made use of the chance and announced the independence of Pernambuco. Paes de Andrade sent invitations to the others provinces of the north and northeast Brazil so that they could join Pernambuco and form the Confederation of the Equator. In thesis, the new republican State would be formed by the provinces of Grand Par√° (current Amazonas, Roraima, Rond√¥nia and Par√°), Maranh√£o, Piau√≠, Cear√°, Rio Grande do Norte, Alagoas, Sergipe, Para√≠ba, Pernambuco and Bahia.

S√£o Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2007, p. 176 However, in Cear√° the situation became more serious with the deposition of the President Pedro Jos√© da Costa Barros, who was substituted by the confederate Trist√£o Gon√ßalves de Alencar Araripe. The other cities and villages of the province refused to accept the act and counterattacked. Alencar Araripe left to the countryside where he tried to defeat the legalist troops. While he was absent the capital of the province, Fortaleza, reaffirmed its loyalty to the Empire.Vianna, H√©lio. Hist√≥ria do Brasil: per√≠odo colonial, monarquia e rep√∫blica. 15. ed.

Andrade refused the offer alleging that he preferred to die fighting ‚Äúin the field of glory‚Äù. On September 12, the army led by Brigadier General Lima e Silva and Paes Barreto attacked Recife. Manuel Paes de Andrade, who had sworn that would fight to death ran away secretly with Jos√© da Natividade Saldanha without informing his companions and departed in a British ship.

Based on contemporary accounts, the flag had a sky-blue field with the coat of arms of the separatist republic.

On the square was a white circle with the words \\"Religi√£o, Independ√™ncia, Uni√£o, Liberdade\\" (religion, independence, union, liberty) separated by square bundles of rods, presumably the lictor's rods of the Roman fasces. On the center of the white circle was a smaller blue circle divided by a horizontal white stripe, and thereon a red cross bottony, which Ribeiro says the report incorrectly described as \\"floretty.\\" Four white stars flanked the lower arm of the cross, two above the white stripe and two below. Nine more white stars were arranged in a semicircle at the bottom of the blue circle.

However, it is now known that the primobucconids as originally defined were a paraphyletic assemblage including taxa as diverse as Coliiformes and Coraciiformes. Indeed, the only remaining genus of the family is Primobucco (without kistneri), and the family as such has been moved to the Coraciiformes.

It acquired its distinctive name through early residents' practice of letting their geese run free in Tanner Creek Gulch and near the wooded ravine in the Tualatin Mountains known as the Tanner Creek Canyon. Tanner Creek Gulch was a 20-block-long, gulch (or hollow) that started around SW 17th and Jefferson and carried the waters of Tanner Creek into Couch Lake (now the site of Old Town/Chinatown and the Pearl District). Over a century ago, Tanner Creek was buried underground (where it still drains the West Hills), and the Tanner Creek Gulch was infilled. Thus, the only remaining part of the hollow is the ravine (Tanner Creek Canyon) carved out by Tanner Creek through which The Sunset Highway carrying US-26 passes and which the Vista Bridge spans (also called the Vista Viaduct). The historically important Canyon Road connects to Jefferson Street underneath the Vista Bridge and was also called \\"The Great Plank Road.\\" Canyon Road passed through Tanner Creek Canyon, which is how the road acquired its name. However, in the 1960s the section of Canyon Road that passes through the canyon was elevated (infilled with excavated dirt from Interstate 405's construction) and is now just a section of Highway 26. The Goose Hollow name had gone out of common usage for several decades until former mayor Bud Clark named his pub The Goose Hollow Inn in 1967 in an effort to \\"rekindle civic regard for the neighborhood.\\" Clark, today, resides in the Goose Hollow neighborhood. Famous residents have included: Daniel H. Lownsdale, Charles Erskine Scott Wood, Congresswoman Nan Wood Honeyman, Erskine Wood, Dr. Marie Equi, John Reed, Abigail Scott Duniway, Julius Meier, Dr. Lendon Smith, Pietro Belluschi, Minor White, Milton Wilson, Chuck Palahniuk, former Mayor Bud Clark, Ken Shores, George Johanson, and Jean Auel. Location Goose Hollow is adjacent to Downtown Portland, Arlington Heights, the Pearl District, the Hillside neighborhood, Northwest District and Washington Park. Providence Park, the Multnomah Athletic Club, and Lincoln High School, the oldest high school in the Pacific Northwest, are located in Goose Hollow. Areas included within the Goose Hollow neighborhood are King's Hill, Vista Ridge, Gander Ridge, and the adjacent flats near the path of Tanner Creek. King's Hill is separated from Vista Ridge by the Tanner Creek Canyon spanned by the Vista Bridge. Vista Ridge (where the Vista Ridge Tunnels are located) is separated from Gander Ridge by Cable Car Canyon. From 1890 to 1905 a steep and enormous trestle bridge passed through this canyon, carrying cable cars up to Portland Heights. The neighborhood boundaries range (north/south) from Burnside Street to the low slopes of the West Hills (officially known as the Tualatin Mountains) and (east/west) from I-405 to Washington Park. Goose Hollow's contemporary boundary and place names overlaid onto 1879 map Points of interest The MAX Light Rail system travels through the neighborhood, stopping at Providence Park and Goose Hollow/SW Jefferson St stations. Goose Hollow is also served by two major freeways: Interstate 405 (which divides it from Downtown Portland) and U.S. Route 26 (which passes under and through part of the neighborhood through the Vista Ridge Tunnels). The Goose Hollow Inn, a tavern on SW Jefferson, is owned by former mayor Bud Clark. Opening scenes for the 2004 film What the Bleep Do We Know!? were filmed in Goose Hollow and included views of the Vista Bridge and the Goose Hollow/SW Jefferson St (MAX station).

Some of his other works include his Storm Peak duology, as well as the adult novel The Grey Raider.  Early life and careers  John Flanagan was born in Sydney, Australia on 22 May 1944. He graduated from Waverley College with plans to become a writer. As he grew up, he changed careers and got a job at an advertising agency. He originally planned to become a trainee copywriter, but the agency instead assigned him to train as a media researcher. While working as a media researcher trainee, he wrote an offensive poem directed toward one of his senior executives. Eventually the poem made it to the desk of one of the company's directors. Flanagan was called into the director's office where he complimented Flanagan's writing skills and offered him the job of trainee copywriter. After working in the advertisement agency for 20 years, Flanagan entered the TV industry and co- wrote a sitcom called Hey Dad..!.  Becoming a writer  Flanagan's early novels originated mainly as thrillers. He started working on what would become the Ranger's Apprentice series in the 1990s. The series originated as twenty short stories for his twelve-year-old son, Michael. Flanagan wanted to encourage his son to read and hoped that he could do so by convincing Michael that the stories were children's book ideas that his father wanted to test out. Also, since Michael was on the smaller side, Flanagan wanted to encourage him by showing that not all heroes must be big and strong. In fact, several characters in Flanagan's books are based on real-life people close to him. Will, the main character in the series, was initially based on Michael. Small, agile, and his love of climbing were all things that Michael and Will shared. Evanlyn, one of the other main characters, was loosely based on Flanagan's daughter Kitty. Finally, Halt, Will's older teacher, was also based on Flanagan's sixth grade teacher. His son fell in love with the series and began asking for more of the stories. In the early 2000s, John decided to make the stories into the first novel, The Ruins of Gorlan, and it was published in 2004. 11 books comprise the main Ranger's Apprentice series. He has also written the Ranger's Apprentice: The Early Years series which explores the time before the first book, and has continued the story in the Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger series.

The argument is that the culture of each of the groups persisted, to provide the basis for the modern United States.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6 Fischer explains \\"the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly democratic in its politics, capitalist in its economy, libertarian in its laws and individualist in its society and pluralistic in its culture.\\"Hackett Fischer, David.

Fischer covers voting patterns and dialects of speech in four regions that span from their Atlantic colonial base to the Pacific. Fischer remarks on his own connective feelings between the Chesapeake and Southern England in Albion's Seed but attempts to flesh them out in Bound Away: Virginia and the Westward Movement, a corollary of his work in the book.Fischer, Albion's Seed, p. 246 =Origins= Fischer states that the book's purpose is to examine the complex cultural processes at work within the four folkways during the time period. Albion's Seed argues, \\"The legacy of four British folkways in early America remains the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society in the United States.\\" The term \\"folkways\\" was originally conceived of by William Graham Sumner, a 19th-century American sociologist. Sumner's treatise Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals posits: > The folkways are habits of the individual and customs of the society which > arise from efforts to satisfy needs; they are intertwined with goblinism and > demonism and primitive notions of luck (sec. 6), and so they win traditional > authority. Then they become regulative for succeeding generations and take > on the character of a social force. They arise no one knows whence or how. > They grow as if by the play of internal life energy. They can be modified, > but only to a limited extent, by the purposeful efforts of men. In time they > lose power, decline, and die, or are transformed. While they are in vigor > they very largely control individual and social undertakings, and they > produce and nourish ideas of world philosophy and life policy. Yet they are > not organic or material. They belong to a superorganic system of relations, > conventions, and institutional arrangements.Sumner, William Graham Folkways: > A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, > and Morals.

More specifically, Fischer's definition of folkways are that they \\"are often highly persistent, but they are never static. Even where they have acquired the status of a tradition they are not necessarily very old. Folkways are constantly in the process of creation, even in our own time.\\" Each of the four distinct folkways is comparatively described and defined in the following terms: * Speech Ways: \\"Conventional patterns of written and spoken language; pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax and grammar.\\" * Building Ways: \\"Prevailing forms of vernacular architecture and high architecture, which tend to be related to one another.\\" * Family Ways: \\"The structure and function of the household and family, both in ideal and actuality.\\" * Marriage Ways: \\"Ideas of the marriage-bond, and cultural processes of courtship, marriage and divorce.\\" * Gender Ways: \\"Customs that regulate social relations between men and women.\\" * Sex Ways: \\"Conventional sexual attitudes and acts, and the treatment of sexual deviance.\\" * Child-Rearing Ways: \\"Ideas of child nature and customs of child nurture.\\" * Naming Ways: \\"Onomastic customs including favoured forenames and the descent of names within the family.\\" * Age Ways: \\"Attitudes towards age, experiences of aging and age relationships.\\" * Death Ways: \\"Attitudes towards death, mortality rituals, mortuary customs and mourning practices.\\" * Religious Ways: \\"Patterns of religious worship, theology, ecclesiology and church architecture.\\" * Magic Ways: \\"Normative beliefs and practices concerning the supernatural.\\" * Learning Ways: \\"Attitudes toward literacy and learning, and conventional patterns of education.\\" * Food Ways: \\"Patterns of diet, nutrition, cooking, eating, feasting and fasting.\\" * Dress Ways: \\"Customs of dress, demeanor, and personal adornment.\\" * Sport Ways: \\"Attitudes toward recreation and leisure; folk games and forms of organized sport.\\" * Work Ways: \\"Work ethics and work experiences; attitudes toward work and the nature of work.\\" * Time Ways: \\"Attitudes toward the use of time, customary methods of time keeping, and the conventional rhythms of life.\\" * Wealth Ways: \\"Attitudes towards wealth and patterns of its distribution.\\" * Rank Ways: \\"The rules by which rank is assigned, the roles which rank entails, and the relations between different ranks.\\" * Social Ways: \\"Conventional patterns of migration, settlement, association and affiliation.\\" * Order Ways: \\"Ideas of order, ordering institutions, forms of disorder, and treatment of the disorderly.\\" * Power Ways: \\"Attitudes toward authority and power; patterns of political participation.\\" * Freedom Ways: \\"Prevailing ideas of liberty and restraint, and libertarian customs and institutions.\\"  See also  * Louis Hartz's \\"fragment thesis\\" which proposes that the political cultures of the New World countries depends on when, and by whom they were colonized References External links * Albion's Seed Grows in the Cumberland Gap, by the University of Virginia 1989 non-fiction books United Kingdom‚ÄìUnited States relations Non-fiction books about immigration to the United States Oxford University Press books Prosopography ","title":"Albion's Seed"},{"id":"5749934","text":"is a first person role-playing video game released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn. It is a part of Sega's Shining series of video games, and marked a new direction for the series, utilizing polygons as well as sprites for the visuals and a story targeted more specifically towards an adult audience. It introduced the saga of the Vandals and the Innovators, abandoning the saga of the Devil Kings which was followed by the previous installments of the series. In contrast to the action-adventure format of the first Shining game on the Saturn, Shining Wisdom, Shining the Holy Ark revived older RPG elements such as extensive first-person dungeon crawling and turn-based combat. It had greater critical success than its predecessor, with praise going to its unique graphical style and engaging battles. Gameplay Gameplay is most similar to Shining in the Darkness; the player explores towns and dungeons in the first- person view, with battles almost exclusively taking place in dungeons. Exploration uses traditional node-based movement rather than the continuous, free-form movement used in most first-person games at the time Shining the Holy Ark was released. The player controls a party of up to four characters, but additional characters can be kept in reserve and called upon mid-battle if needed. Battles take place at random and are in a turn-based format, maintaining the first-person view but also allowing the player to view allies as they take their actions. As with every previous game in the Shining series, Shining the Holy Ark uses a menu system in which each menu has exactly four options, all represented by icons. The effectiveness of the playable characters is increased through the traditional methods of earning experience points and equipping better weapons and armor. New spells are learned automatically when the character reaches higher experience levels. The game utilizes a \\"pixie\\" system, where the player can befriend pixies that can attack enemies at the opening of an encounter. There are five types of pixie: fairy, pixie, succubus, incubus, and leprechaun. When an enemy appears, the player has a few seconds to select the right type of pixie for the direction that the enemy is coming from. For example, leprechauns will only attack enemies that come from underground, while fairies only attack enemies that drop down from above. If the player selects the right type of pixie, it deals some damage to the enemies and increases the amount of gold and experience points earned from the encounter. Towns can be explored freely without encountering battles, and include buildings where the player can purchase new armor and weapons, save their game, and have their party recover from injuries and illness. Plot Mercenaries Arthur, Melody, and Forte are hired by the King of Enrich to hunt down and capture a renegade ninja by the name of Rodi. The group pursues Rodi to the nearby mines where, after a brief skirmish, an unknown craft crashes through the roof. All four characters are gravely injured, but soon healed by being possessed by strange spirits. While those inhabiting Arthur, Melody and Rodi seem benevolent, Forte is occupied by an evil spirit. From here the story follows the three unwitting heroes as they fight to stop the revival of the legendary 1,000 year kingdom, which would return the world to an age of darkness.Complete script for USA translation , Shining Force Central. Shining the Holy Ark takes place 20 years before Shining Force III. While in the town of Enrich, Arthur and the others meet a young boy named Julian. He tells them that his father went to investigate a haunted mansion in the woods, but never returned. Since that time he has been in the care of a family friend. It would later be discovered that Julian's father was killed by Galm, one of the mythical Vandals that ruled over the world during the time of the 1,000 year kingdom. His father's death compels Julian to seek revenge against Galm, which sets into motion his involvement in the events of Shining Force III.Shining Force Chronology and Connections, Shining Force Central.

One of the game's major antagonists. Development The story of Shining the Holy Ark was designed with a more mature audience in mind than earlier games in the Shining series were targeted towards. In a 2009 interview, producer Hiroyuki Takahashi commented: \\"Until [Shining] Wisdom, the idea had been simply to develop a story that would attract a broad range of users. From Holy Ark on, the story and game were redesigned to focus on the Saturn players of the time. Japanese Saturn owners were generally in their late-teens or early-twenties. The age group had shifted away from children, so... the concept was 'fantasy that can be enjoyed by adults'. This new approach led to a darker, deeper world than we had been creating for the 'all ages' category prior to Holy Ark. We started to work on the plot of a story that would be appropriate in such a world.\\"(November 2009). \\"Behind the Scenes: Shining Force\\", GamesTM (90): 136‚Äì41. The game's soundtrack was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, who later wrote the music for Shining Force III. The game was unveiled in August 1996 at the first Tokyo Game Show, with a 5% complete version on display. Reception Though critical reactions to Shining the Holy Ark varied widely, nearly every review concluded with a strong recommendation to buy the game. Next Generation summarized, \\"Boasting some sharp, innovative graphics and interesting gameplay elements that haven't been widely used in traditional, turn-based RPGs, SHA truly shines.\\" Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine called it \\"the best RPG I've played in ages.\\" Trent Ward, reviewing for GameSpot, summed up that \\"There's nothing in Shining the Holy Ark that RPG fans haven't seen in one form or another before, but it does put them all together nicely.\\" GamePro wrote \\"Shining the Holy Arks hypnotic gameplay, supernatural story line, and spellbinding fun will pleasantly entrance you.\\" Reviewers overwhelmingly approved of the game's graphics. Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it has \\"some of the best animation ever seen in an RPG.\\" He and his co- reviewer Dan Hsu both found the first-person perspective a refreshing change from the overhead perspective used in nearly every other RPG of the time. Next Generation instead stated that it is the game's particular combination of polygons and sprites that \\"gives SHA a high level of detail and a visual uniqueness that not only looks great during gameplay, but sets the title apart from the bulk of other recent games in the genre.\\" GamePro commented that the \\"crisp, colorful sprites combine with creepy creatures and eye-catching spells to deliver a visually appealing adventure.\\" Leadbetter was less enthusiastic about the graphics than most, saying that the villages are stunning but the dungeon designs are dull. Reactions to the story were more mixed. While Leadbetter, Sushi-X of EGM, and GamePro all commented positively on it, Ward said it was generic and predictable, with the only saving grace being the solid English translation. Next Generation seconded Ward on these points, but added that the story was at least \\"deep enough to keep up a solid, substantial pace.\\" Commentary on the gameplay centered almost exclusively on the combat. Leadbetter remarked that the game features \\"a wealth of different adversaries, each with different capabilities that make each confrontation a different tactical challenge.\\" Next Generation and Crispin Boyer of EGM both praised the pixie system as adding further depth to the game. However, Boyer, along with Ward, also said that the enemy animations often drag on too long, slowing the pace of battle. Ward still had an overall positive impression of the combat, and asserted that \\"The game is well balanced and provides a fighting challenge without making it impossible to win scenarios.\\" EGMs Shawn Smith disagreed, saying the enemy types get increasingly hard too quickly. In contrast, GamePro said the fact that players don't lose any of the items they've acquired when their party is wiped out makes the game too easy.

The whole set of negotiations of the years 802‚Äì815 has also been referred to by this name. By its terms, after several years of diplomatic exchanges, the Byzantine emperor's representatives recognized the authority in the West of Charlemagne, and East and West negotiated their boundaries in the Adriatic Sea. Failed negotiations of 803 On Christmas Day in 800 AD, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Imperator Romanorum (Latin for \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") in Saint Peter's Basilica. Nikephoros I of the Byzantine Empire and Charlemagne tried to settle their imperial boundaries in 803. A first treaty was indeed prepared and sent to the East in 803 by Charlemagne, who had started talks with Empress Irene. The text, however, was never ratified by Nikephoros, as the Royal Frankish Annals, and Charlemagne in a surviving document, explicitly state. The Franks had already subdued the March of Istria in 788,Fine, John V. A., Jr. (2006). When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre- Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods, University of Michigan Press. and after overturning the Avar khaganate, they claimed the rich Pannonian plain and the Dalmatian coast; during these events, Slavic prince Vojnomir of Pannonia allied with the Franks. Dalmatian Croatia, located in what was nominally Byzantine Dalmatia, peacefully accepted limited Frankish overlordship. Further talks between 803 and 806 Though Nikephoros always refused to recognize Charlemagne's imperial title, envoys of the East and West made agreements over the possession of disputed Italian territory, namely, the provinces of Venetia and Dalmatian Croatia, during the first decade of the ninth century. These seem to have been advantageous to the Venetians and to have guaranteed Byzantine sovereignty over them. War and peace, 806‚Äì814 Temporary shift of Venetian loyalties toward the Franks resulted in somewhat permanent naval conflict in the Adriatic, only interrupted by a truce in 807‚Äì808. After Charlemagne's son and king of Italy Pippin's invasion of Dalmatia tension rose between the two Empires. Political and military instability, however, lasted only until the king's death, in July 810. Then a new treaty came under discussion between Charlemagne, temporarily ruling over Italy, and Nikephoros. Aigone, Count of Forl√¨, was a member of the delegation sent by Charlemagne to Nikephoros.Flavio Biondo, Historiarum ab inclinatione romanorum imperii, II, l. II (Basel 1531, p. 167). The agreement was signed. Thus the name pax Nicephori may be justifiably applied to this second episode of diplomatic activity. However, only Michael I Rhangabes recognized Charlemagne's imperial title, reserving for the East the title \\"Emperor of the Romans\\", and the treaty was not definitely ratified until four years later, after both Michael's and Charlemagne's death, by Louis the Pious and Leo V. Some amendments, more advantageous to Venice, are thought to have been added then. The peace of Aachen in 812 confirmed Dalmatian Croatia, except for the Byzantine cities and islands, as under Frankish domain.Dzino 2010, p. 183 The boundaries in Dalmatia imposed by this treaty were unclear, so in 817 Leo V sent en embassy to Aachen to clarify them. The result was a joint Frankish and Byzantine expedition to Dalmatia to get the input of the local Romans and Slavs and firmly delimit the borders. Buffer states The common belief that the negotiations between Byzantium and the Franks that were held in the early ninth century made Venice an 'independent polity' is only based on the late, allusive and biased witness of Venetian chroniclers such as John the Deacon and Andrea Dandolo and remains therefore highly questionable. Sources and documents No text of either the treaty, its draft or the preceding negotiations is preserved, apart from a handful of alleged quotations in a mid-century deliberation of Emperor Lothar I in favour of one of the earliest certainly attested Doges of Venice.

Blair Niles (n√©e Mary Blair Rice, 1880‚Äì1959) was an American novelist and travel writer. She was a founding member of the Society of Woman Geographers.  Early life and expeditions  Born Mary Blair Rice, Blair was born on The Oaks, her parents' plantation in Staunton, Virginia. She was educated at home by her mother, Marie Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Rice, who taught a night school for her four children and children of the sharecroppers. At age 14, Blair attended the Northfield Seminary for Young Ladies in MassachusettsLetter from Gordon Rice to Franklina Barlett (July 19, 1898), Virginia Historical Society, Franklina Bartlett Collection. and then the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where she studied domestic science. In 1902, she married William Beebe, Curator of Birds at the New York Zoological Park, now the Bronx Zoo. Within the first year of their marriage, they went on three honeymoon expeditions: to Nova Scotia, Oak Lodge, a boarding house for naturalists on the Indian River in Florida, and to Cobb Island, Virginia. In 1904, they traveled to Mexico, and in 1908 and 1909, they traveled to Venezuela and British Guyana to scout out a location for a Tropical Research Station to be sponsored by the Bronx Zoo. When they published Our Search for Wilderness about their South American travels, Blair received the recognition she long desired: she was credited as a co-author, with her name listed first. Their plans to establish a Tropical Field Station in South America were interrupted when they received an offer from Anthony Kuser to underwrite an eighteen-month expedition to Asia to study and collect pheasants. In December 1910, they boarded the R.M.S. Lusitania to start the pheasant expedition. They traveled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), India, China, Borneo, Indonesia, Malay, Japan, and Singapore.  Divorce and suffrage  In 1913, Blair traveled to Reno to divorce William Beebe on the grounds of cruelty. A few days after the divorce, she married architect Robert \\"Robin\\" Niles. For a few years, she worked in the suffrage movement and was a New York delegate to the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage.  Writing career  In the early 1920s, Blair began writing travel books. In 1923, she published Casual Wanderings in Ecuador. Colombia: Land of Miracles followed in 1924, and Peruvian Pageant in 1937. She developed a new approach to writing travel books, which she called \\"the human travel book\\" in which she linked contemporary culture with the past by exploring history, traditions, and legends. Her breakthrough book was Black Haiti: A Biography of Africa's Eldest Daughter (1926), which told the story of the largest slave revolt in history led by Toussaint L'Overture. This book was closely followed by Condemned to Devil's Island (1928), the bestselling fictionalized account of the escapes of Ren√© Belbeno√Æt, a prisoner on the Devil's Island penal colony in French Guiana. The book was made into a Hollywood movie, Condemned. Blair was the first woman to visit Devil's Island. Her book is credited with drawing public attention to the prison, resulting in its eventual closure. When the Depression hit, Blair looked for places closer too home to investigate. In 1931, she published Strange Brother, the first book to compassionately portray gay men in Harlem. Blair then turned to writing books about Latin America, with a focus on the ancient Aztec, Incan, and Quiche civilizations. On the centennial of the Supreme Court's United States v. The Amistad decision, Blair wrote a novel that introduced to a new generation to the Court's decision, which held that kidnapped Africans were not the property of their ‚Äúowners.‚Äù The book, called East by Day, was selected as one of twenty books by readers of the New York Herald for Great Britain readers. It served as her atonement for her grandfather's role in the Civil War. She knew that her grandfather, Roger Atkinson Pryor, spoke in Charleston, South Carolina urging the Confederates to open fire on Fort Sumter to force Virginia into secession. According to The New York Times, this speech was the ‚Äúmatch that exploded the powder magazine and brought on the war.‚Äù As one of Confederate General Beauregard's aides-de-camp, Roger declined the offer to fire the first cannon of the Civil War. This book motivated Blair to write East by Day.  Society of Woman Geographers  In 1925, during tea with Marguerite Harrison, Blair suggested the formation of a society for woman explorers because the all-men Explorers Club banned women from membership. Marguerite endorsed the idea and they presented it to Gertrude Emerson Sen and Gertrude Mathews Shelby, also explorers. They recruited Harriet Chalmers Adams as president of the newly formed Society of Woman Geographers. The organization grew rapidly and admitted as members such illustrious women as Amelia Earhart, Margaret Mead, Osa Johnson, Annie Smith Peck, Louise Arner Boyd, Josephine Peary, Pearl S. Buck, Malvina Hoffman, Gloria Hollister, Anna Heyward Taylor, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Te Ata, Membership was not limited to explorers, but included anyone whose published works (including art and music) contributed to the understanding of the countries on which the member specialized. The Society is still in existence today. More recent members include Jane Goodall, Sylvia Earle, and Kathryn Sullivan.  Ancestry  In 1859, Blair's grandfather, Roger Atkinson Pryor, was appointed to fill a vacant seat in the United States House of Representatives, representing Virginia. Later he became a judge in New York State. Blair Niles was the granddaughter of Sara Rice Pryor and Roger Pryor, and the daughter of Marie Gordon Pryor. Her unique namesake, \\"Mary Blair,\\" is shared with her mother's sister, Mary Blair Pryor, her cousin Mary Blair Walker Zimmer, and several other women in her lineage, as documented in *\\"Mary Blair Destiny\\".Richman, Erin Mary Blair Destiny, Two Goddesses Publishing, page 41-42 . Her grandmother Sara Rice Pryor was also a widely- read author for her chronicling of life in antebellum Virginia. Blair Niles did not have any children of her own. Honorable recognition The City of Lima had awarded Blair a gold medal for her book, Peruvian Pageant on the 117th anniversary of the independence of Peru. In 1941, Blair Niles was awarded the Constance Skinner Award, now the Women's National Book Award. She was the second recipient of that award. In 1944, the Society of Woman Geographers bestowed its third Gold medal on Blair.

They do not appear to be a direct ancestor of modern swifts, however, but rather a group that retained an overall basal morphology. Altogether, they were not too dissimilar from modern treeswifts. Fossils of Aegialornis have been found in Middle to Late Eocene deposits of Germany and France. An Early Eocene record from the Nanjemoy Formation of Virginia, United States (USNM 496384) is very doubtful, as apodiform birds seem not to have occurred there until after the Eocene. This bone might more properly belong to the Parvicuculidae.Mayr, Gerald & Mourer- Chauvir√©: A specimen of Parvicuculus Harrison & Walker 1977 (Aves: Parvicuculidae) from the early Eocene of France. Bull. B. O. C. 125(4): 299-304. PDF fulltext The taxonomy of the species is quite convoluted, with both the smaller A. germanicus and the larger A. leenhardti being sometimes considered junior synonyms of A. gallicus, which in turn is sometimes erroneously assumed to be identical to Cypselavus gallicus. Similarly, A. broweri is occasionally considered to be based on small individuals of A. wetmorei, and these latter two taxa were recently separated as genus Mesogiornis (Ml√≠kovsk√Ω, 2002); this does not appear to have found general acceptance however. The presumed species Aegialornis szarskii is now placed in Scaniacypselus. Which genera apart from the present one should be included in the Aegialornithidae is not quite certain. Primapus belongs either here or is a basal true swift, and Cypselavus is either an aegialornithid or a treeswift. The latter group is sometimes controversially included in the Aegialornithidae, as are the Jungornithidae, another prehistoric apodiform family that was somewhat intermediate between treeswifts and hummingbirds.

In the early 19th century the idea of linking the lowlands around Lough Neagh with the Erne Basin and the River Shannon system became popular with the more progressive landowners and merchants of Armagh, Monaghan and Fermanagh. The Ulster Canal was built between 1825 and 1842 and was 74 km (46 mi) long with 26 locks. It ran from Charlemont on the River Blackwater to Wattle Bridge on the River Finn, south-east of Upper Lough Erne. It was an ill-considered venture, with the locks built narrower than the other Irish waterways, preventing through trade, and an inadequate water supply. It was an abject failure commercially, and contributed to the collapse of the Lagan Navigation Company, who took it over from the government but were then refused permission to abandon it when they could not afford the maintenance costs. It finally closed in 1931. Waterways Ireland started work on rebuilding the canal at its southern end in 2015. History In 1778, a proposal was made for a canal from Ballyshannon to the Lower Lough Erne. The estimated cost of the scheme was ¬£32,000, but it was already seen as part of a larger project, since a further ¬£8,000 would have provided a link to Enniskillen, Belturbet and Ballyconnell. A future link from Ballyconnell to Ballymore, along the Woodford River valley, and on to Lough Scurr and the River Shannon at Leitrim was suggested but not costed. It would thus be an important section of a great waterway which was to cross Ireland from east to west, from Belfast to Limerick, which would compete with a similar link formed by the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal further to the south. Government funding was forthcoming in 1783, and a section of the canal was constructed between Ballyshannon and Belleek, with Richard Evans, the engineer for the Royal Canal, overseeing the work, which included a lock at Belleek. The project stalled in 1794, when funds ran out. The Directors General of Inland Navigation asked Evans to prepare an estimate of the costs to finish the work in 1801, but no action was taken. By 1814, the Directors General were faced with problems of unemployment in the area, and a canal from Lough Neagh to Lough Erne was seen as a way to provide jobs for the local population. John Killaly was commissioned to survey the route of such a link, and produced his report in February 1815. His estimate of ¬£233,000 would provide a canal which ascended through six locks from Wattle Bridge to a summit near Monaghan and then descended through another sixteen to reach Lough Neagh. It would be long, and would include a branch to Armagh. The plan was ill-thought-out, as he decided to make the locks of a similar size to those on the Royal Canal, , which would accommodate boats up to about wide, but those that already used Lough Neagh, and the Lagan Canal, the Newry Canal and the Coalisland Canal, were wide, and would not therefore be able to use the route. A public meeting was held at Monaghan in February 1817, and despite strong local support, including an offer to provide two-thirds of the cost by a group of landowners and businessmen, the Directors General did not take any action, and the project remained an idea. The proprietors who had taken over the Lagan Canal in 1810 saw the link as a way to increase traffic on their own canal, and public support for it grew steadily, until a large group of people requested parliamentary approval for a revised scheme, which was very similar to Killaly's of a decade previously. The government remained unconvinced that they would receive a return on any money advanced, and so the Directors General could not act. Finally, in 1825, a private company was authorised to construct the canal. It was estimated to cost ¬£160,050, as a new survey had produced a plan which only needed eighteen locks. The company then applied to the borrow ¬£100,000 from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission, a body created under the Poor Employment Act of 1817. The engineer Thomas Telford was sent to Ireland to inspect the plans and estimates, which he duly approved, but the interest rates on the loan could not be agreed, and three further Acts of Parliament were obtained before a loan of ¬£120,000 was agreed. Problems were then experienced with the contractors, Henry, Mullins and MacMahon from Dublin, who were awarded the construction contract in 1832. Telford then decided that there were serious problems with the design and that a new survey should be made. This increased the number of locks to 26, and the contractors were asked for a new estimate. Agreement could not be reached, and they eventually withdrew from the project. John Killaly, the local engineer, died in 1832, and it in not known whether he decided to reduce the width of the locks before he died, or whether the decision was made by Telford, but they were built wide, preventing through traffic except in specially built boats. William Cubitt succeeded Telford after he died in 1834. The canal was eventually finished in 1841. From the summit pound, nineteen locks descended to Lough Neagh, and in the other direction, seven descended to Lough Erne. Water was supplied by Quig Lough reservoir, a lake near Monaghan which had been enlarged. The final lock at Wattle Bridge was only wide, making it the narrowest in Ireland. The project had cost over ¬£230,000. =Operation= The canal failed to generate significant trade, as the water supply was inadequate, and goods had to be transhipped at either end into narrower boats. In addition, there was no link to the River Shannon to generate through traffic, and unlikely to be one while the canal did not prosper. The company were unable to repay any of the loan made by the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners, and in 1851, the Board of Public Works took control of it. After cosmetic repairs, it was leased to William Dargan, who had built most of it as contractor, and ran the only significant carrying operation on the waterway. The Ulster Railway reached Monaghan in 1858, and three years later the canal was in a ruinous state. Sir John Macneill, the Irish railway engineer, suggested that the best use of it was to drain the water and lets cows graze on it. In an attempt to recoup their losses, the government took control of it again in 1865, closed it, and spent ¬£22,000 over eight years on repairs. Their main priority was to secure an adequate water supply, but when the canal reopened in 1873, this proved not to have been achieved. Maintenance costs far exceeded revenue, and what little traffic there was, was confined to the Lough Erne end of the canal, as the summit was mostly unnavigable, and there was only sufficient water during eight months of every year. However, there was a slight improvement in traffic in 1880, when W. R. Rea, the secretary of the Lagan Navigation Company, set up a new carrying company using smaller boats. There was a vague promise of government aid for any company interested in taking it over. A series of negotiations then took place, but the government failed on three occasions to pass a bill to authorise the sellout to the Lagan Canal. They eventually suggested that the Lagan Canal should try to obtain a private bill to achieve the aim, and they were successful in doing so in 1888. =Decline= The House of Lords had succeeded in removing a clause from the bill which allowed the Lagan Canal company to close the Ulster Canal after ten years, and they were saddled with a liability in perpetuity. Vast sums were spent on maintenance, compared to income, and although some trade developed, profits from the Lagan Canal and the Coalisland Canal, which they also owned, were swallowed up in trying to keep the Ulster Canal open. The company never really recovered from the acquisition. The last boat to enter the canal did so in 1929, and a \\"warrant of abandonment\\" was finally obtained on 9 January 1931. This allowed them to abandon the section of the canal in Northern Ireland. An \\"order of release\\", obtained on 15 April, removed all liability for maintenance. A similar order in the newly established Republic of Ireland was refused. In the 1940s Monaghan County Council was granted a Judgement Mortgage on the canal in lieu of unpaid rates. Lagan Navigation offered to give the canal to the Council in lieu of monies owed, but the Council declined, having been advised that the upkeep of bridges etc. would be beyond their ability to finance. Lagan Navigation Co was dissolved under the Inland Navigation Act (NI) 1954. This left the stretch through Monaghan as 'ownerless goods' (bona vacantia) and as such fell to the Minister for Finance. Ownership passed to the Office of Public Works under the State Property Act 1954. In the early 1970s, Monaghan County Council, Monaghan Urban District Council and Clones Urban District Council each acquired some sections of the canal under the Derelict Sites Act 1961. Stretches which were not derelict at that time (i.e., which were being occupied) could not be acquired and ownership remains with the Office of Public Works. Route The canal at Clones Road, Monaghan The canal follows a fairly straight south-west to north-east course from Wattle Bridge, on the River Finn, to Charlemont, where it joins the River Blackwater. There were two locks close to the River Finn, two beyond Clones, and three near Smithborough, where the summit was reached. The summit pound was less than long, and was fed from Quig Lough reservoir, just to the north of the end of the summit. Two locks drop the level before Monaghan is reached and there is a flight of seven shortly after the town. The border with Northern Ireland crosses the canal below them. There are two isolated locks near Middletown, and the a level section before the canal reaches a gorge to the west of Benburb. Fitting the canal through here presented a lot of problems for the builders, as another six locks were required in awkward terrain. There is another lock above Blackwatertown, and the final lock below Charlemont, before the canal joins the River Blackwater. The summit level was above sea level. The original locks were built for boats which were . Of the large number of bridges that crossed the canal, 56 remained in 2002. Restoration A feasibility study into the possible reopening of the waterway was carried out in 1998 (and revised in 2000). The report found that there were no insurmountable engineering problems to such a plan but issues such as lock capacity/size and the adequacy of the water supply would need to be addressed. All historic locks would need to be significantly widened to at least to accommodate modern waterway craft. A restored canal would create significant long-term financial benefits to the local economy, however, the report concluded that unless the reasons that caused it to be an abject failure in the first place were not addressed, there seemed little point in restoring the canal. Ulster Canal at Tyholland. In 2004 Waterways Ireland announced that a reopened canal would bring enormous benefits to the areas it passed through, because it would reconnect with the already restored Shannon‚ÄìErne Waterway (opened 23 May 1994). Rather than being a true restoration, it involved the construction of a state-of-the-art waterway along a historic route, and a similar approach would be required on the Ulster Canal. At the North/South Ministerial Council meeting on 17 July 2007, it was announced that the governments would work towards the restoration of the stretch of the canal linking the town of Clones, in County Monaghan, to Upper Lough Erne. The cost of the development would be ‚Ç¨35 million, paid for by the Irish Exchequer. In August 2010, Waterways Ireland published an Ulster Canal Restoration Plan, an Environmental Report and an Appropriate Assessment. In September 2010 it held two Public Information Days, one in Clones, Co. Monaghan, and one in Newtownbutler, Co. Fermanagh, and invited written comments on its plans by 30 September 2010. Reports on the proposed restoration were available in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. Despite a few objections, Minister Heather Humphreys announced in February 2015 that the Irish government had given its approval to Waterways Ireland for the restoration of the canal between Castle Saunderson and Erne basin. The funding would come from Waterways Ireland. On 24 April 2015 the project was formally launched, when a meeting was held at Derrykerrib Bridge, attended by Heather Humphreys and representatives of Waterways Ireland. The first phase involved extending the Erne Navigation from Quivvy Lough to Castle Saunderson, near Belturbet. Of the forming this phase, some will be a new cut, following a somewhat different route to the original canal, and a new Derrykerrib Bridge will be built, to increase the size of boats that can pass through it. Dredging of a section of the River Finn was expected to take place in Autumn 2015, but this was delayed, with \\"contractual issues\\" being cited as the cause. Waterways Ireland's budget for 2016 included ‚Ç¨2.7 million earmarked for the Ulster Canal project. There were further delays caused by poor ground conditions, flooding, and the need to maintain access for residents while the work was ongoing. The new bridge and its associated channel were expected to be completed by April 2018.

It was first released in Australia on 1 November 2004, and in the United States on 16 June 2005. Flanagan first conceived the world of the novel in a series of short stories he wrote for his son to incite his interest in reading. Ten years later, he decided to turn them into The Ruins of Gorlan, the first book in the Ranger's Apprentice series. Concept and development The Ruins of Gorlan was originally a set of short stories written by author John Flanagan for his son Michael to encourage him to read. Flanagan wrote one story each week for twenty weeks. About ten years later, Flanagan returned to these stories and decided to write them into a full-length novel. The character Horace was based on Michael's friend Jeremy, but in the original short stories Flanagan made Horace the villain. In the stories, Horace disappears after Will saves his life on the boar hunt, while in the novel, Flanagan was able to make Morgarath the main villain and \\"rehabilitate\\" Horace to keep him as a main character. Flanagan thought that the idea of a bully being bullied was a strong concept that was not in the original stories and was later incorporated into the novel. He planned this parallel storyline in Battleschool to develop and show how Horace could help Will through his \\"linear thinking\\". Flanagan was careful to make the distinction that Horace was not stupid, since he was, in fact, a straight thinker which helped balance Will's wild thinking. Will was based on Michael, and shared some of his physical attributes, including his small stature and agile movement. Most importantly, Flanagan wanted to show his son that there was an advantage to being small and that not all heroes have to be tall and muscular. Plot summary Morgarath, the exiled lord of the bleak, barren Mountains of Rain and Night has been waiting fifteen years in his dark realm, carefully planning his revenge against the Kingdom of Araluen. His former fief, known as Gorlan, was long ago brought to ruin as a result of his unsuccessful rebellion against King Duncan. Now he silently plots to rebel again, rallying hideous creatures known as Wargals to his side. Wargals have little will of their own, and are easy to control, therefore being suitable as soldiers in Morgarath's army. After fifteen years, Morgarath prepares to unleash his power, except using two strong beasts called the Kalkara, which are very powerful ape-like assassins, to attempt to weaken the Kingdom before trying to take the Kingdom once more. Meanwhile in Araluen, in Redmont Fief, a special day has come for 15-year-old Will and his fellow wardmates (Horace, Alyss, George, and Jenny), called Choosing Day, where they all become an apprentice to a craftmaster or have to work in the local farms. Jenny is apprenticed to Master Chubb, the castle cook. Horace is accepted to Battleschool, and George is accepted to Scribeschool, while Alyss is accepted as a courier. Although Will's first choice was Battleschool (he does this because he thinks his father was a brave knight, although he doesn't know for sure what happened to him), Baron Arald explains to him that his talents lie in other directions. Instead of being accepted to Battleschool, he becomes apprenticed to Halt the Ranger, after sneaking into a guarded tower at the castle. Rangers are the intelligence group of the country and specialize in long-range weapons and the art of staying unseen. Will is not overly excited about this, but he is trained in these skills The main reason why he is being trained in these skills is that he needs to prepare for the annual Ranger meeting called the Gathering. During this time he begins to establish a closeness to Halt and starts to realize that being a Ranger is much better than it seems. Will is given a horse named Tug, from an old horse trainer by the name of Old Bob. In the meantime, Will's wardmate Horace is in Battle school. His life is harsh and he is bullied by three older Battleschool cadets: Alda, Bryn, and Jerome. During a local holiday known as Harvest Day, Horace and Will fight, increasing their hatred for each other. A few days after this incident, Will and Halt find signs of a wild boar that has been roaming the area. They also meet a rambling, frightened farmer by the name of Salt Peter. The two get a group of men that will kill the boar, and Horace is recruited to the boar hunt. During the hunt, it is discovered that there are two boars, one which is killed by a hunter, and the other runs straight at Horace, who tries to kill it but fails. Will distracts the boar, also tries to kill it and fails, and is saved by inches from death by Halt's well-timed arrow. In saving Horace's life, he cements a friendship between Will and Horace and erases the lasting tension between the two. Sometime after the killing of the boar, Alda, Bryn, and Jerome corner Horace and beat him brutally. They then proceed to the forest to give Will the same treatment. He manages to evade the three for a few minutes but is quickly overpowered. Horace then arrives and intervenes, and the bullies leave Will to continue hitting Horace. They are in turn stopped by Halt, who invites Horace to swordfight the bullies individually. One by one, he defeats them and incapacitates Alda. As a punishment, they are banished from the fief, making Horace closer to the Rangers. However, it has now come time for Halt and Will to leave for the Gathering. Here Will meets Halt's former apprentice, Gilan. During the Gathering, the Rangers receive a report that the Kalkara, vicious creatures under the control of Morgarath, have entered Araluen. Halt, Will and Gilan leave to track down and kill the Kalkara. Halt thinks that the Kalkara is headed to the Ruins of Gorlan and tells Will to go back to Redmont, get back up and rendezvous at the ruins. At Redmont, Baron Arald, and Sir Rodney head out to slay the Kalkara (with several others following) and to save Halt. Finding that Halt is battling the Kalkara alone (and not faring so well), Sir Rodney and Baron Arald manage to knock one into the fire, but are badly injured by the other. Will watches, horrified, and knows he must do something. He runs over to a torch that Baron Arald dropped, creates a flaming arrow, and shoots the Kalkara fatally in the chest. Back at his fief, Will is considered a hero and receives his bronze oakleaf which identifies him as a Ranger's apprentice. When he and his ward mates reunite to congratulate him at an inn, Alyss surprisingly kisses Will. Meanwhile, Araluen prepares for a war with Lord Morgarath and his army of Wargals.  Critical reception  Reviewers praised the action and characters of The Ruins of Gorlan. Steven Engelfried of School Library Journal enjoyed the description of Ranger crafts and meetings with bullies and a wild boar which \\"help to establish the boy's emerging character\\". Engelfried said the \\"well-paced plot moves effortlessly toward the climax, letting readers get to know the world and the characters gradually as excitement builds\\". However, he felt that the sudden welcome by the public was a little over the top since Rangers are described as silent and solitary. Carolyn Phelan from Booklist praised how Will is a normal hero without any magical skills making him a very original and believable character. Phelan also recognised the setting as \\"a colorful place, threatened by an evil warlord and his fierce minions, but it's the details of everyday living and the true-to-life emotions that are memorable\\". Kirkus Reviews found that \\"Flanagan does nothing to boost his typecast characters, familiar themes or conventional, video-game plot above the general run, but readers with a taste for quickly paced adventure with tidy, predictable resolutions (Kalkara and bullies vanquished, Will and Horace become heroes and buddies) won't be disappointed\\". =Awards= The Ruins of Gorlan received an Aurealis Award in 2004 and was chosen as the Children's Book Council of Australia Notable Book in 2005. In 2008, the book was nominated for the Grand Canyon Reader Award. Film Adaptation As of 7 January 2008, Warner Bros. Pictures has obtained the film rights for The Ruins of Gorlan and is in discussion with Canadian director Paul Haggis. Although the film exhausted its funding not long after the original time the project began, author John Flanagan has confirmed that as of December 2014, the group had re-acquired the necessary funds, and were to start production Summer 2015.

The Th√©nardiers, commonly known as Monsieur Th√©nardier (; ) and Madame Th√©nardier, are fictional characters, the main antagonists in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Mis√©rables and in many adaptations of the novel into other media. They are ordinary working-class people who blame society for their sufferings. Early in the novel, they own an inn and cheat their customers. After they lose the inn in bankruptcy, they change their name to \\"Jondrette\\" and live by begging and petty thievery. They serve, alongside Javert, as one of the two arch-nemeses of the story's protagonist, Jean Valjean. While Javert represents the justice system that would punish Valjean, the Thenardiers represent the lawless subculture of society that would blackmail him. The novel portrays them as brutal and abusive figures; some adaptations transform them into buffoonish characters, though sometimes still criminals, to provide comic relief from the generally more serious tone of the story. In the novel = Part One: Fantine = When Hugo introduces the Th√©nardiers, they have two daughters named √âponine and Azelma, whom they spoil and pamper as children, and a son called Gavroche.

The Th√©nardiers treat Cosette very badly, dressing her in rags, selling her clothes for 60 francs in the streets of Paris, forcing her to work, and beating her often. Fantine is eventually reduced to working as a prostitute in order to earn enough money to meet the Thenardiers' demands, as M. Th√©nardier extorts more money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is ill. The Th√©nardiers spend the money Fantine sends them on their daughters. = Part Two: Cosette = After Fantine's death, Jean Valjean arrives in Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette all alone fetching a pail of water for the Th√©nardiers in a dark forest and accompanies her back to the inn. After arranging lodgings at the inn for the night, he observes how the Th√©nardiers abuse her and how √âponine and Azelma mimic their parents' behavior and complain when Cosette plays with their doll. Valjean leaves the inn and returns a moment later with a beautiful new doll, which he offers to Cosette. At first Cosette is unsure if the doll really is for her and is reluctant to take it, but then joyfully accepts it. Mme. Th√©nardier is furious but M. Th√©nardier tells her that Valjean can do as he wishes as long as he pays them. On Christmas Day, Valjean informs the Th√©nardiers that he wants to take Cosette away with him. Mme. Th√©nardier immediately agrees, but M. Th√©nardier feigns affection for Cosette and reluctance to give her up. Valjean pays them 1,500 francs, settling all of Fantine's debts, and he and Cosette leave the inn. M. Th√©nardier tries to swindle more money out of Valjean. He runs after them and tells Valjean that he has changed his mind and wants Cosette back. He claims that Cosette's mother gave her into their care and that he cannot release Cosette without a note from her mother. Valjean hands him a letter signed by Fantine authorizing him to take charge of Cosette. M. Th√©nardier orders Valjean to either give back Cosette or pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean ignores him and departs with Cosette. M. Th√©nardier expresses regret that he did not bring his gun, and turns back to the inn. = Part Three: Marius = The inn, which is forced to close down after Cosette is taken, is called \\"The Sergeant at Waterloo\\", because of a peculiar adventure that M. Th√©nardier had following the famous battle. While looting the corpses shortly after the fighting has ceased, M. Th√©nardier accidentally saves the life of a Colonel, The Baron Pontmercy. Not wanting to be revealed as a looter, Th√©nardier claimed to be a sergeant of Napoleon's army. The tale as told by Th√©nardier eventually transformed into one of him rescuing a General during the heat of battle under a hail of grapeshot, as it grew more elaborate with each telling. In a bizarre coincidence, the Th√©nardier family ends up living next to the disgraced son of the baron, Marius Pontmercy, at an apartment building named Gorbeau House nine years after the closing of the inn. In the nine years following the inn's closing, the Th√©nardier family had assumed the name Jondrette. In addition, they had born two more sons, whom they essentially sold to Magnon so that she could pass them off as the children supported by Marius' grandfather M. Gillenormand for the sake of procuring child support. Magnon had accused M. Gillenormand of fathering the two children, which he denied, although he agreed to support them as long as Magnon did not bring him any more children to support. The Th√©nardiers' eldest son, Gavroche, was left to the streets, where he became a gamin. The Jondrettes support themselves by sending letters begging for money to well- known philanthropists. √âponine comes in the apartment in a rush and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving any minute to visit them. In order to look poorer, M. Jondrette puts out their fire and breaks a chair. He then orders Azelma to punch out a window pane. Although hesitant, she does so, resulting in cutting her hand. M. Jondrette is pleased, for he had hoped for that result. The philanthropist and his daughter then come into their apartment; they turn out to be Valjean and Cosette. Marius, observing the Jondrettes through a crack in the wall, recognizes Cosette as the girl he met in the Luxembourg Garden. After their visit, M. Jondrette arranges with Valjean to meet again, but after recognizing Valjean, he plots to rob him upon his arrival with the aid of the street gang Patron-Minette. Javert, from the first French-language edition. Marius learns of M. Jondrette's plan to rob Valjean, and goes to the police. At the police station, an inspector named Javert instructs Marius to stand lookout with two pistols, and to fire as soon as the crime is committed to signal the police to come. Marius returns to his apartment and continues to observe the Jondrettes. M. Jondrette sends √âponine and Azelma outside as look-outs. When Valjean returns with rent money, M. Jondrette and Patron-Minette ambush him and he reveals his real identity: M. Th√©nardier. Marius, hearing this, recognizes him as the man his father had mentioned in his will as a hero who was due any service that Marius could grant him. Marius, torn between his desire to aid Valjean and his sense of duty to the man who had once saved his father, does not signal the police. Valjean denies knowing M. Th√©nardier and that they have never met. Valjean then tries to escape through a window, but he is restrained and tied up. M. Th√©nardier orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette, telling her to return to the apartment, and they would keep her as a hostage until Valjean delivers 200,000 francs to him. After Valjean writes the letter and gives his address, M. Th√©nardier sends out Mme. Th√©nardier to get Cosette. However, Mme. Th√©nardier comes back alone, and announces the address Valjean has given is a false address. It was during her absence that Valjean has managed to free himself. M. Th√©nardier decides with Patron-Minette that they have no choice but to kill Valjean. Marius remembers that √âponine had come into his apartment earlier and wrote on a sheet of paper \\"The cognes (police) are here\\" to prove her literacy. Marius grabs the paper and throws it in through the wall crack. M. Th√©nardier reads it and thinks √âponine threw it inside as a warning. The Th√©nardiers and Patron-Minette try to escape, but Javert arrives and arrests them all (except Gavroche, who is not present, and Montparnasse, who escapes). Valjean escapes through the window undetected. = Part Four: St. Denis = Mme. Th√©nardier dies in prison and √âponine and Azelma are released. Gavroche, not involved with his family's crimes, encounters purely by chance his two younger brothers, who are unaware of their identities. He briefly takes care of them, but they soon leave him in search of their missing foster mother. It is unknown what has happened to the two after that. √âponine is sent by Babet to investigate Valjean's house, but since she knows that Cosette, who now lives with Valjean, is the beloved of her former neighbor Marius (for whom she harbors some affection), sends back a biscuit to Babet (which is code for \\"not worth the trouble\\"). She leads Marius to Valjean's house so that he may be with his beloved. M. Th√©nardier and Patron-Minette, with the aid of Gavroche, manage to escape from jail and persist in robbing Valjean's house. However, √âponine wards them off by threatening to scream. The next day, √âponine tries to tear Cosette and Marius apart by sending Valjean a warning to \\"move out,\\" and later telling Marius that his friends invited him to fight with them at the barricade at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, intending for both her and Marius to perish in the rebellion of 1832 so that she will not have to share him with Cosette. Both √âponine and Gavroche are killed at Rue de la Chanvrerie, despite Marius' efforts to protect the Th√©nardier family. = Part Five: Jean Valjean = Th√©nardier presents himself to Marius as \\"M. Th√©nard\\". Marius himself is wounded in the battle, and Valjean attempts to save him by taking him through the sewers into safety. In the sewers, Valjean encounters Th√©nardier, who is hiding from Javert. Thinking Valjean to be a simple murderer, Th√©nardier offers Valjean his key to the sewer grating in exchange for the contents of Marius' pockets. He then searches Valjean and Marius' pockets. Believing Marius to be a corpse, he tears off part of Marius' coat in order to blackmail Valjean with it later. Th√©nardier finds only 30 francs, reluctantly takes the money, and lets Valjean out. Th√©nardier and his child Azelma are in the Mardi Gras parade. When he sees Marius and Cosette's wedding party pass by, he recognizes Valjean as both the man who had ruined him and the man he had met in the sewer, and orders Azelma to follow him and find out where he lives. Th√©nardier visits Marius dressed in a rented statesman's suit and identifying himself as \\"M. Th√©nard\\", but Marius eventually recognizes him. Th√©nardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows about Valjean's past, but he inadvertently corrects Marius' misunderstandings about Valjean and reveals Valjean's good deeds. He then tries to expose Valjean for a murderer, producing the piece of Marius' jacket as proof. Marius realizes that it is a piece of his own jacket, and that that must mean that Valjean saved him from the battle and carried him through the sewers to safety. Marius pulls out his bloodied coat. He tells Th√©nardier he knows enough of his criminal past \\"to send you to the galleys\\", gives him 1500 francs, and orders him to leave and never return. Th√©nardier moves with Azelma to America, where he becomes a slave trader.Vol. 5, Book 9, Ch. 4 In the musical The Th√©nardiers are featured in the musical based on Hugo's novel. They own an inn in the town of Montfermeil, where they have been entrusted with the care of Cosette, Fantine's daughter. However, the Th√©nardiers treat Cosette as a servant whilst pampering their own daughter √âponine. They welcome all customers to their inn, but whilst they appear to look friendly and welcoming, they secretly con their customers with watered-down wine, sausages made with horse kidney or cat liver, and extra fees for ridiculous things such as lice, looking in their mirrors, and keeping their windows closed. (\\"Master of the House\\"). One night after sending Cosette out to draw water from the well, she returns to them in the company of Valjean. Valjean tells them of Fantine's passing and initially requests to take Cosette with him, but the Th√©nardiers attempt to con Valjean, deceivingly claiming they love Cosette as if she was their own daughter, have had to purchase expensive medicine to treat her for frequent illness, and are worried about the treacherous people she may encounter in the outside world (\\"The Th√©nardier Waltz of Treachery\\"). In the end, Valjean offers 1500 francs to take Cosette, and delighted with the money, the Th√©nardiers hand her over without question. Nine years later, they are living in the slums of Paris, having lost their inn. One day, they hatch a plan to rob Valjean, whom they have learned is now also living in Paris (\\"The Robbery\\"). They disguise themselves as beggars and beg the passing Valjean and Cosette to give them money. With the help of robbers Brujon, Babet, Montparnasse, and Claquesous, they surround Valjean and rip open his shirt, revealing the brand on his chest. However, √âponine notices the police arriving and warns them, but they are captured by Javert and his constables. Th√©nardier tells Javert about Valjean and the brand on his chest and that he is the one who Javert should really arrest, and Javert releases them. The Th√©nardiers then try to rob Valjean again (\\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\\"). Th√©nardier and his gang of robbers reach the gates of Valjean's house on Rue Plumet, when √âponine intercepts them and tries to force them to leave in order to protect Marius. Th√©nardier refuses to listen and orders √âponine to leave. √âponine is forced to scream in order to get them to leave. Th√©nardier threatens her but is forced to run, and he and his gang escape via the sewers. Afterwards, whilst the students plan to build the barricades, the Th√©nardiers plan to wait underground, in the hope that they will pick up lots of wealth and riches from the dead students after the battle is over (\\"One Day More\\"). After the barricade falls, Th√©nardier is in the Parisian sewers robbing the corpses of the rebels (\\"Dog Eats Dog\\"). Here he crosses a man carrying what he believes to be an unknown corpse (actually the unconscious Marius, wounded from the barricades). When the man collapses, Th√©nardier steals a ring from the Marius' body, and then departs upon realizing that the collapsed man is Jean Valjean. The Th√©nardiers appear at the wedding of Marius and Cosette, posing as the Baron and Baroness de Th√©nard. Marius sees through their disguise and orders them to leave, but they refuse to do so until they have properly extorted him. They attempt to blackmail Marius with the information that Valjean is a murderer, offering the stolen ring as evidence. Their plan backfires when Marius recognizes the ring as his own, realizing that Valjean must have rescued him after the barricades fell. He hits Th√©nardier and throws him the rest of his money before leading Cosette away, leaving the Th√©nardiers to enjoy the feast and gloat over their survival, despite their children's deaths (\\"Beggars At The Feast\\"). This was altered in the film adaptation, where the Th√©nardiers are thrown out of the party after their extortion attempt fails. Along with Javert, they do not appear in the show's finale, presumably due to their villainous roles, as well as the fact that they are among the few characters to survive the entire play. =Differences in the musical= * Unlike their portrayal in the novel, the Th√©nardiers are given a more humorous and relatively light-hearted role in the musical version of Les Mis√©rables (although the songs featuring Th√©nardier without his wife are darker in tone). Composer Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg said \\"in the middle of a dramatic and very sad story we decided to turn the Th√©nardiers into a kind of comic characters...to relax the audience because it's a very heavy show.\\" Though they remain the real villains of the story, the Th√©nardiers provide more or less all of the laughs in the show, and are therefore some of the musical's most popular characters. * Mme. Th√©nardier disdains her husband in the musical, but is willing to work with him to further their collective schemes; in the book, she worships him in the beginning, and their relationship cools as the plot progresses. * Although Gavroche is present in the musical, no reference is made about him being the Th√©nardiers' son. * The Th√©nardiers' other daughter Azelma and their two youngest sons are also cut from the musical. This could imply that √âponine is presented as the Th√©nardiers‚Äô only child. * In the middle of the novel, Mme. Th√©nardier dies in prison; while at the end of the musical, she is shown to be alive and well with her husband at Marius and Cosette's wedding. * In the musical, at the wedding of Marius Pontmercy and Cosette, the Th√©nardiers, posing as the Baron and Baroness du Th√©nard rather than merely M. and Mme. Th√©nard, try to blackmail Marius by telling him that Cosette's father is a murderer. Th√©nardier reveals a ring he robbed from the corpse that Valjean was carrying. Marius recognises the ring as his and realises that Valjean rescued him from the barricades that night. = Songs = In the musical, the Th√©nardiers appear in the following songs: ; Castle on a Cloud (Madame Th√©nardier only): A song of Cosette's dreams of heaven, which is quickly interrupted by Madame Th√©nardier to make her fetch a bucket of water. Known as Mon Prince au Chemin or Une poup√©e dans la vitrine in the successive French versions. ; Master of the House: A song sung by both of the Th√©nardiers, along with his drunken customers singing how well it is to have power in the pub. Known as La Devise du Cabaretier in the original French version, then as Ma√Ætre Th√©nardier in the 1991 version. ; The Th√©nardier Waltz of Treachery: Where the duo repeatedly try to swindle as much money as they can from Valjean in exchange for Cosette. Known as La Valse de la Fourberie then as La Transaction in the various French version. ; The Robbery/Javert's Intervention: Th√©nardier approaches Valjean, asking for donations for the fake child seen in Look Down. Th√©nardier recognizes Valjean and assaults him before Javert intervenes. ; The Attack on Rue Plumet (Th√©nardier only): Known simply as Rue Plumet in the original French version, and later as Le casse de la Rue Plumet. Th√©nardier rounds up his gang as they attempt to rob Valjean's home as he blames his poverty on him. √âponine stops them from doing so and they are forced to retreat. ; One Day More: Though small, the two appear every now and then telling how they'll simply hide in the shadows, wait things out, and pick the pockets of the corpses when they're the only ones left. Known as Demain in the original French version and as Le Grand Jour in the 1991 version. ; The Sewers/Dog Eats Dog (Th√©nardier only): Th√©nardier sings to himself in the sewers as he fingers through the bodies of the students. One of the show's darkest songs, it is known as Fureurs Cannibales in the 1991 French version. ; Beggars at the Feast: The Th√©nardiers describe how they enjoy sneaking into parties and chatting with the upper crust of society. They gloat about their survival.  Adaptations  Since the original publication of Les Mis√©rables in 1862, the characters of the Th√©nardiers have been presented in many adaptations of the novel in various media, including books, films,Th√©nardier (Character) at the Internet Movie DatabaseMme.

It is an older suburban subdivision, composed of a near-even mix of single-family detached houses and multiple-unit apartment and semi-detached dwellings. As of 2006, the area was home to 5,206 residents. The neighbourhood is a middle-income area, with an average family income of $51,857, an average dwelling value of $204,213 and a home ownership rate of 43.8%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $288,651. Sutherland was administered as a separate town outside of Saskatoon before being annexed by the city in 1956. History Powe Residence Original Sutherland School James Powe and his family arrived in Saskatoon from Ontario in 1884. The Powe family homesteaded in the area which is now Sutherland in 1893. Their grand house, which stands on the present-day corner of Central Avenue and 115th Street, was built between 1912 and 1914. The foundation was made from local fieldstone, making the basement walls as thick as . Albert Hanson, a noted Saskatoon real estate agent, bought land in the Sutherland area beginning in 1905. He then sold some of it to the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose branch line between Regina and Edmonton reached Saskatoon in 1907. The area of Sutherland was built up as the CPR yards and station were constructed east of Saskatoon. This was in keeping with the railway's practice of bypassing existing communities and building its own town sites on land it owned, thus sharing the real estate profits with no one. Hanson subdivided the rest of his land as residential and commercial properties, laid out on a typical north-south grid pattern. The railway's town site was on a grid parallel to the tracks, resulting in a triangular gap between the two areas. This became built up as an industrial area (later the separate Sutherland Industrial subdivision). Most of the subsequent population growth occurred on Hanson's land west of the tracks, due in part to the lack of schools or parks on the east side. The first settler in the new townsite was Nelson Emery, a CPR timekeeper, storekeeper, and building inspector. In 1908, the City of Saskatoon struck an agreement to supply water to the yards. The first post office was also established that year, with W. G. Clark as its first postmaster. The first school, a temporary one-room structure, was opened in November 1908 on a site on 109th Street. On February 2, 1909, a newer one- room school was opened at the present-day Sutherland School site on Egbert Avenue and 111th Street. By the spring of 1909 the settlement had a population of 102, and the residents applied for incorporation as a village. The village of Sutherland was created on August 30, 1909. It was named after William Charles Sutherland, a politician who served on Saskatoon's town council before it became a city in 1906. The Sutherland Curling Club was founded and built its first rink in 1910. By 1912, Sutherland's population had grown to 1000, enabling it to incorporate as a town. A new town hall was completed in January 1912, at the corner of Egbert Avenue and 108th Street. On November 12 of the same year, the cornerstone for a new multi-storey Sutherland School was laid. The grand \\"castle\\" style school opened for the 1913-1914 school year. In 1914, the town received service from the Saskatoon Municipal Railway. With a population of 1500 by 1912, growth was stalled by the economic recession prior to World War I. Significant growth did not occur again until the 1950s - in 1956, the town was annexed by the growing city of Saskatoon. Sutherland became the city's easternmost neighbourhood until development in the 1970s took place even further east. The amalgamation required some name changes to Sutherland's streets, to avoid confusion with identically-named streets already in Saskatoon (e.g. 6th Street became 110th Street). Also, some named streets were eventually renamed in order to remove conflict with existing Saskatoon streets. Examples include Fraser Street, which was named Fitzgerald Street (because Saskatoon had a Fraser Crescent), and Railway Avenue, which became Gray Avenue in deference to Saskatoon's version (which itself was closed in the 1960s). However, Sutherland's main street, Central Avenue, retained its name, even though once Sutherland became part of Saskatoon, the name was no longer accurate in a technical sense. In addition, while Lorne Avenue was generally used to demarcate \\"East\\" and \\"West\\" addressing within Saskatoon east of the river, in order to avoid having to renumber housing, a separate East- West demarcation remained in place for Sutherland (and its later adjacent communities), with Central remaining the boundary. In 1960, a new one-storey Sutherland School was opened beside the 1913 school. By 1963, additional classrooms and an auditorium were added. The \\"castle\\" school also received some cosmetic upgrades in 1960-61, but the building had fallen into disrepair. The weakened structure was condemned in July 1967 and demolished the next month. The 1912 cornerstone was the only item preserved. Despite its relative initial remoteness to the rest of Saskatoon, Sutherland was initially one of eastern gateways to the city, as Highway 5 entered the city along 115th Street and wound its way through the townsite, this link was later rendered redundant in the 1960s when College Street was extended eastward and became College Drive, linking up with Highway 5; 115th Street continued to connect to Highway 5, however, providing an alternate access into Sutherland until it was closed in the 1980s to facilitate residential development. Access to Sutherland was further facilitated by the completion of the northeast leg of the Circle Drive ring road in 1983, although construction of the freeway resulted in the closure of 115th Street which had previously connected with Preston Avenue; however, this link was later replaced by Attridge Drive, a major arterial branch off Circle Drive that also linked with Preston. Just to the south of Sutherland, the intersection of Central Avenue and 8th Street became known as \\"Stephenson's Corner\\", and was a local landmark as the city's streetcar line would turn northwards towards Sutherland at that point. The area became a regional commercial hub, and continues to be so today (The Centre shopping mall is located there), although the Central Avenue link was removed with the development of College Park in the late 1960s (the portion of Central Avenue south of College Drive became Acadia Drive). By the 1980s, neighbourhoods had developed east of Sutherland, no longer making it the city's eastern edge. In 1984, the Sutherland-Forest Grove Community Association was founded, with its stated goal of promoting and assisting in the educational, recreational and social programs for families in the two adjacent neighbourhoods. In the 1990s, neighbourhood boundaries were redrawn, and the residential area of the former railway townsite along Gray Avenue was transferred to the Forest Grove neighbourhood. On June 29, 2006, workers digging out fuel tanks at the Mac's convenience store on 108th Street and Central Avenue unearthed human remains. Investigators determined that it was a woman who had been murdered sometime between 1910 and 1920 and thrown down a well. Her body had been preserved in a mixture of gasoline and water, enabling forensic archeologists to extract a DNA sample. The crime is still unsolved, and as yet, no living descendants of the woman have been found. In 2009, Saskatoon police released a 3-D facial reconstruction and several composite sketches of the victim, in the hope of solving the case. Government and politics Sutherland is located within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîUniversity. It is currently represented by Corey Tochor of the Conservative Party of Canada, who was first elected in 2019. Provincially, the area is located within the constituency of Saskatoon Silverspring-Sutherland. It is currently represented by Paul Merriman of the Saskatchewan Party, first elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2016. Municipally, Sutherland lies within Ward 1, currently represented by Darren Hill who was first elected in 2006. Institutions =Education= *Bishop Filevich Ukrainian Bilingual School - separate (Catholic) elementary, part of Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools. Formerly named Holy Family School, it was renamed officially on September 28, 2006. *Sutherland School - public elementary, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division. * University of Saskatchewan - located immediately west of Sutherland, with access via 108th Street and College Drive. =Public safety= * Fire Station #5 - provides service to the east side of Saskatoon including Sutherland, Forest Grove and Erindale. Parks and recreation * Hilliard Gardner Park (1.0 acres) * C.F. Patterson Park (1.4 acres) * Kopko Park (1.6 acres) * Anna McIntosh Park (2.2 acres) * C.F. Patterson Park North (2.3 acres) * Father Basil Markle Park (3.9 acres) * Herbert Stewart Park (4.8 acres) * Sutherland Park (9.1 acres) The ACT Arena is a city-owned indoor ice rink, home to hockey, ringette, figure skating and speedskating clubs, as well as public skating and Learn-to-Skate programs. The Sutherland-Forest Grove Community Association was incorporated in 1984 and is run by volunteers. It plans, coordinates, and administers seasonal programs for all age groups, from adult fitness to teen programs, children's sports and toddler activities. It also works with local schools and the City to maintain and operate neighbourhood parks and outdoor rinks. Commercial Central Avenue Since Sutherland's founding, almost all commercial activity has been located on its main street, Central Avenue. The vast majority of businesses are found between 108th and 115th Streets. Technically, all businesses located on the east side of Central Avenue north of 108th Street actually lie within the Sutherland Industrial subdivision, but most locals do not make this distinction. There is also a large greenhouse located within Sutherland, on the corner of Central Avenue and Attridge Drive. 62 home-based business exist in the area. In the 1980s plans were announced for the construction of a Real Canadian Superstore big-box grocery retailer on a remnant piece of former University of Saskatchewan land \\"orphaned\\" by the construction of the northeast leg of Circle Drive. Protests from area residents resulted in the plan being dropped; the grocery store was instead built on 8th Street East, and as of 2017 official city maps show the remnant land as earmarked for \\"future residential\\" though no time frame for development has as yet been announced. Newer commercial development in the nearby University Heights Suburban Centre neighbourhood and Preston Crossing big-box complex caused a dramatic increase in Sutherland's commercial vacancy rate in the mid-2000s. In 2007, Saskatoon's city council held off further commercial development in the northeast, to halt a further decline in the business district.

The title is taken from the opening phrase of the document. It begins: \\"Among the concerns of the pastoral office, ... a leading one is without question that of maintaining and promoting the decorum of the House of God in which the august mysteries of religion are celebrated....\\"Tra le sollecitudini dell‚Äôofficio pastorale, ... senza dubbio √® precipua quella di mantenere e promuovere il decoro della Casa di Dio, dove gli augusti misteri della religione si celebrano.... The regulations pointed toward more traditional music and critiqued the turn toward modern, orchestral productions at Mass.  Context  By the late nineteenth century, \\"operatic Church-music\\" was dominant in Italy. Churches were known to set Latin texts to such secular favorites as the sextet from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor or the quartet from Verdi's Rigoletto. A movement for liturgical reform, including scholarship devoted to early Church practice and Gregorian Chant performance, had developed over the course of the nineteenth century. Local jurisdictions implemented changes independent of direction from the Vatican. Earlier in his career Pope Pius taught courses on liturgical music and chant to seminarians. In 1888, as Bishop of Mantua, he removed women from church choirs and ended the use of bands. A few years later as Patriarch of Venice, he ended the use of a popular setting of \\"Tantum Ergo\\" and instituted Sunday Vespers chanted by a choir of men and boys. In 1893, when Pope Leo XIII was considering issuing guidance on liturgical music, the future Pius X submitted a 43-page proposal. A section of that document, substantially unchanged, he issued ten years later, less than four months after becoming pope, as Tra le sollecitudini. The new rules were adopted more readily in Italy, where the introduction of secular music had been greatest. The reception of TLS in Belgium was termed a \\"dead letter\\" and in France Saint-Sa√´ns sided with its opponents. Responses to TLS varied with musical tastes, though some pointed to Italy as the proper target of the charge of theatricality. Some Americans protested that the prohibition on women vocalists would simply be ignored, where popular sentiment viewed the choir as an expression of the congregation rather than, as Pius did, as a clerical and therefore exclusively male role. Pope Pius implemented the principles of TLS in his immediate jurisdiction through the Roman Commission on Sacred Music, which he had established in 1901. Provisions TLS reaffirmed the primacy of Gregorian chant, which had largely fallen out of favor, and the superiority of Renaissance polyphony, especially that of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, over other, later polyphonic music. It recognized that some modern compositions are \\"of such excellence, sobriety and gravity, that they are in no way unworthy of the liturgical functions\\", but warned that they needed to be \\"free from reminiscences of motifs adopted in the theaters, and be not fashioned even in their external forms after the manner of profane pieces\\". Texts of the variable and common parts of the liturgy should always be in Latin and sung \\"without alteration or inversion of the words, without undue repetition, without breaking syllables, and always in a manner intelligible to the faithful who listen\\". It also prohibited female singers, discouraged music with secular influences, and barred the use of piano, percussion, and all other instruments aside from the organ, unless given special permission from a bishop or comparable prelate to use wind instruments. The failure to allow for strings excluded many classical works composed expressly for liturgical use, including the many settings of the ordinary of the Mass by Haydn and Schubert, Mozart's Requiem, and Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. In a 2001 address to the members of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, Pope John Paul II echoed Pius' words, that sacred music should be \\"an integral part of the solemn liturgy, sharing its overall purpose which is the glory of God and the sanctification and edification of the faithful\\".Tra le Sollecitudini, ASS 36 [1903], p. 332)\\"Pope John Paul II Address to the Professors and Students of The Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music\\", Adoremus, January 19, 2001 In 2003, Pope John Paul II marked the centenary of TLS with an essay on liturgical music, underscoring points of agreement and occasionally adjusting its principles.

The first novel in the series, The Ruins of Gorlan, was released in Australia on 1 November 2004. The books were initially released in Australia and New Zealand, though have since been released in 14 other countries. The series follows the adventures of Will, an orphan who is chosen as an apprentice Ranger, skilled trackers, archers and warriors in the service of the King of Araluen. Will strives to keep the Kingdom of Araluen safe from invaders, traitors, and threats. He is joined on his adventures by his mentor Halt and his best friend Horace. The series originally consisted of twelve books, with the eleventh book being a collection of short stories and the twelfth being a follow-up novel set 16 years later. A prequel series, Ranger's Apprentice: The Early Years, has released two titles, the first in 2015 and the second in 2016. A spin-off series, Brotherband, which is set in the same universe, though with new characters, started in 2011. The sixth book in the Brotherband series came out in June 2016. In 2018 the twelfth book of the Ranger's Apprentice series was renamed and made the first book in a sequel series, Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger. The series has sold over three million copies. The series was originally twenty short stories Flanagan wrote for his son to get him interested in reading. Ten years later, Flanagan found the stories again and decided to turn them into a book. BookPeople, a bookstore in Texas, helped promote the book through a five-day camp in 2010. The series is well praised by critics.  Plot  =Apprenticeship= In the first book, The Ruins of Gorlan, orphan Will, and four other characters (Jenny, Alyss, Horace, and George), are Wards of Castle Redmont. At age 15, the orphans are expected to either become chosen as an apprentice of one of the Craftmasters at Redmont Fief or to work in the fields surrounding the castle. Will wants to be a knight but is denied apprenticeship by the Battlemaster and other various Craftsmasters. Instead, Will is selected by Halt to become one of the mysterious Rangers. Rangers are the intelligence force and the unofficial \\"spies\\" of Araluen. They have mastered many skills. After being an apprentice for a few days, Halt, a legendary Ranger, takes Will to get a special Ranger horse. With Tug, his new horse, Will trains in the skills needed to pass his assessment at the annual Rangers' Gathering. However, the Gathering is cut short with rumors of Morgarath, a traitor to the kingdom, becoming active. His underlings, the monstrous Kalkara, have been sighted. Will, Halt's former apprentice Gilan, and Halt pursue the Kalkara, two monstrous creatures with a transfixing gaze. After several days of tracking, Will travels back to Castle Redmont to fetch help, returning just in time. Both Kalkara are killed successfully. In the second book, The Burning Bridge, a war with Morgarath is approaching and Will, Gilan, and Horace, Will's friend and a knight in training, are sent to Celtica, a nearby country, to ask for reinforcements. However, when they arrive, every town they find is deserted. Only a girl from Araluen named Evanlyn can tell them what has happened. Wargals, mindless minions of Morgarath, have kidnapped and slaughtered some of the villagers and forced the rest to flee. Gilan moves on ahead of Will and Horace to report to the king. Meanwhile, Will, Horace, and Evanlyn encounter Wargals. They follow them to the Fissure, a deep gorge thought to be impassable. The Celtic miners were all captured to complete a bridge across the Fissure, and a tunnel through the cliffs above up to Morgarath's lair. The bridge and tunnel would allow Morgarath's army to assault the King's army from behind. Will, Horace and Evanlyn, who is in truth, the Crown Princess Cassandra, discover this. Horace tells Gilan what happened and they ride back to the main army. They inform the king and his advisers of Morgarath's plan, and the king dispatches an auxiliary force, led by Halt, to stop a force of Skandian warriors that have come up from the coast to outflank the king's army. Halt succeeds in destroying the Skandian force and he returns to the king with a plan. Halt's troops disguise like Skandians, leading Morgarath to believe that the Skandians are ready to outflank the king. This goads Morgarath into ordering his Wargals to charge into the open plain. However, just as the armies are about to collide, the king's army parts in the middle, and Halt's cavalry charge down the open center at the advancing Wargals. The Wargals, who are afraid only of horses, are demolished by Halt's cavalry, and by the king's horsemen who join in the assault. Seeing his army destroyed, Morgarath offers a flag of truce and prepares to challenge Halt to single combat to avenge his own defeat. Halt nearly accepts Morgarath's challenge, but Horace challenges Morgarath instead. Because he is inexperienced and Morgarath is an accomplished warrior, Horace is outmatched by Morgarath. However, by diving under the hooves of Morgarath's steed, Horace manages to dismount him. Fighting on foot, Horace's sword is broken, but he uses a Ranger tactic, which he learned in Celtica watching Will and Gilan practice it, to stop Morgarath's next attack, and he stabs Morgarath through the heart. Will and Cassandra are taken by the Skandians to be sold as slaves. In the third book, The Icebound Land, Will and Cassandra are taken as slaves to Skandia, a frozen, pine- forested country north-east across the Stormwhite Sea at the Araluen border. When they reach Hallasholm, the Skandian capital, Will is forced to work outside in the bitter cold of the yard, while Cassandra is taken into the kitchens. He quickly becomes addicted to warmweed, a drug that gives a person warmth but also destroys the mind and body. The Skandian who captured Will and Cassandra, Erak, sets up a plot to rid Will of his addiction and escape with Cassandra. The two succeed in escaping, and take refuge in a small log cabin for winter. Following Erak's advice, Cassandra gives Will ever-decreasing amounts of warmweed at ever-increasing intervals. Soon after, Will overcomes his addiction to warmweed. Meanwhile, to rescue Will and Cassandra, Horace and Halt also set off for Skandia by crossing into Gallica and making their way north along the coast. Horace becomes known as \\"The Oakleaf Knight\\" as he defeats many Gallican knights in combat, thereby attracting the attention of Deparnieux, a famed Gallican knight. Deparnieux gets tricked by Halt and is killed. Later, Halt \\"accidentally\\" left a burning torch on a pile of oily rags, and so sparks a fire that burns Deparnieux's keep. In the fourth book, Oakleaf Bearers, or as it is known in the United States The Battle for Skandia, while foraging for food, Cassandra is captured by a Temujai warrior. The Temujai are a fierce, nomadic tribe of horse warriors from the east and are masters of the recurve bow. Will tries to rescue her, but fails until Horace and Halt come along. Halt captures one Temujai and realizes the Temujai are back to try and take over the western world again. Twenty years earlier, they almost succeeded until politics and a serving of bad shellfish got in the way. Halt agrees to help Skandia drive off the Temujai since Halt feels if the Temujai defeats the Skandians, they will then attack Teutlandt, Gallica, and at last, Araluen. The Skandians make use of Halt's knowledge of the Temujai tactics, and Will takes charge of a force of archers to use in the upcoming battle against the Temujai. During the battle, the Skandians surprise the Temujai with their archers, and they use the archers to destroy the Temujai system. The Temujai are forced to withdraw or risk having their previous conquests revolt. The Skandia Oberjarl Ragnak is killed in the battle, and Erak is elected to succeed him. Cassandra and Erak agree to the Treaty of Hallasholm, in which Erak agrees to stop massed attacks against Araluen resulting in the end of constant Skandian raids against the Araluen coast. Erak's Ransom takes place in between books 4 and 5, a few months before Will receives his Silver Oakleaf. Skandia Oberjarl Erak Starfollower goes on one last raid to Arrida. However, he gets captured for a ransom while he is attempting to raid Al Shabah, a province in Arrida. Because Erak believes that he was betrayed by Toshak, a rival Skandian, the raiding party goes to Araluen, instead of Skandia, for the ransom money. Princess Cassandra goes to Arrida to negotiate prices with Selethen, the Wakir (leader) of Al Shabah. Will, Gilan, Halt, Horace, and thirty of Erak's men go along for protection. They are also there to deliver the ransom. After the negotiation is over, Selethen reveals that Erak was being held in Mararoc, a fort in the desert, so they travel there. However, Erak is stolen by the Tualaghi, a merciless nomadic tribe of devil worshipers. The rescue party, with the help of the Bedullin tribe, eventually turn the leader of the Tualaghi into a slobbering mess and free Erak. Princess Cassandra reasons that she no longer has to pay the ransom to the Arridi, because the Tualaghi held Erak when the Araluens saw him. Nevertheless, she decides to pay twenty thousand reels of silver each to the Bedullin and the Arridi. At the end of the book, Will is promoted to full Ranger and is awarded a Silver Oakleaf. =First mission as a Ranger= After receiving his Silver Oakleaf and being given Seacliff Fief to take care of, Will takes on his first mission as a full-fledged Ranger throughout the books of The Sorcerer in the North and The Siege of Macindaw. A few weeks after arriving in the fief, Will is sent north to Castle Macindaw to investigate claims of sorcery, disguised as a traveling minstrel. The lord of Castle Macindaw, Syron, was struck down. Many believe a sorcerer to be the cause of the illness since Syron's ancestor was also murdered by a sorcerer which is Malkallam, an old sorcerer who poisoned Syron's ancestor. Alyss, also in disguise as Lady Gwendolyn, is sent up to help Will, but is captured by the rogue knight Keren, responsible for poisoning Syron and Orman. Will manages to escape with Orman and his assistant Xander, and enlists the help of the sorcerer who is in fact a gifted healer called Malcolm. Horace is also sent up north by Halt to provide back-up. To rescue the castle and Alyss, Horace and Will devise a plan. They receive the help of the Skandians that Will had given supplies to and use them to assault the castle. Horace explains that to successfully capture a castle, a three-to-one ratio is needed. With only about 25 Skandians and 35 soldiers in the castle this would seem impossible. Will heard a rumour of a Scotti invasion so he captures General MacHaddish, who tells him the plan. Malcolm sets up some conjurations that draw the attention of the soldiers in the castle to one side, while Will and Horace infiltrate the castle using a strange upside-down cart. Soon the Skandians also enter the castle. Will quickly climbs up to the tower where Alyss is being held. However, Keren hypnotised Alyss into believing Will is the enemy, and orders her to kill him. As she holds a sword above her head to kill him, Will tells Alyss that he loves her, and the hypnosis is broken. As Keren attacks Will, she throws acid into Keren's face and Keren stumbles backwards in agony and falls out the window (which Alyss had weakened with the same acid) while the Skandians, led by Horace, take control of the castle. Will returns to his fief (Seacliff) with his first mission as a full Ranger a success. At his log cabin he receives a letter from Alyss stating that Will told her in a dream that he loved her, and that Horace has told her that although it seems like a dream, it might not be. At the end of her letter she writes \\"I love you, Will.\\" Will leaves his log cabin again with Tug to deliver his own reply to Alyss. =The Outsiders= In The Kings of Clonmel, Will, Halt and Horace are sent to Clonmel to prevent a cult called the Outsiders from taking power. The cult offers to protect a village from bandits that are actually part of the Outsiders in exchange for gold. When the village has been stripped of its possessions, the cult runs off to the next village. In this fashion, they have taken over five of the six kingdoms of Hibernia. Halt, Will and Horace are sent to Clonmel, the last kingdom, to try to prevent the cult from expanding into Araluen. Halt tries to persuade his twin brother, King Ferris of Clonmel, to use his troops to drive the cult out. In the end, the cult loses power in Clonmel, but the leader, Tennyson, runs away to try to reach the other five kingdoms of Hibernia, which he controls. During the confusion when Tennyson escapes, King Ferris is killed by a Genovesan assassin, and Halt's nephew Sean becomes king. Will, Halt and Horace leave Clonmel to chase the false prophet, Tennyson. In Halt's Peril, after reaching a smuggler's port and managing to get information on Tennyson's whereabouts, the trio hires a ship to take them to Picta, where a smuggler had taken him. The chase is on as the three pursue him through a drowned forest, and finally, at an encounter with Tennyson's hired assassins, Halt is shot with a poisoned arrow and is incapacitated. Due to Picta's geographical location being near Macindaw, Will does a tiring one- day one-night ride to reach Malcolm, the man that is the best healer in all of Araluen, if not the world. After bringing the healer back, Will learns that Halt was poisoned with a toxin that has another toxin extremely similar to it, and they both have antidotes, but the wrong one will kill him. Will then captures the assassin that fired the arrow, and forces him into telling which type of toxin he used by poisoning the assassin with his own poison, and Malcolm cures Halt. Later that night, the assassin tries to escape, but Will manages to kill him before he does. The group, on the move again, manage to find that Tennyson is up to his old tricks again and is trying to swindle the money out of more countrymen. Using Halt's similarity to King Ferris, whom Tennyson murdered, they manage to discredit Tennyson in front of the farmers. They proceed to use their reputation as Rangers and drive the men off. Will manages to kill Tennyson by dropping the entire batch of Malcolm's self-made smoke bombs, causing a cave-in that kills Tennyson and his followers in the debris, giving Halt, Horace, and Will a heroes' welcome when they return to Araluen. =The Emperor of Nihon-Ja= The Emperor of Nihon-Ja begins with Horace and George in Nihon-Ja, speaking with their Emperor, Shigeru. Meanwhile, Will, Halt, Selethen, and Alyss are watching a Toscan general demonstrate his military tactics while at a treaty signing between the Toscans and the Arridi, both allies of Araluen. During a ride in which the Emperor of Nihon-Ja accompanies Horace and George back to the city in which they could sail back home, they are told by the Emperor's Cousin, Shukin, that there has been a coup against the Emperor. Furthermore, a Senshi (a skilled Nihon-Jan swordsman) ambush nearly succeeds in killing the Emperor, but Horace intervenes and decides to help the seemingly ill-fated Emperor find a legendary, impenetrable fortress known as Ran-Koshi while George goes to the nearest city and sends word to the famous Ranger duo. Back in Toscana, the Crown Princess of Araluen, Cassandra, appears and enlists the help of the two Rangers, Alyss, and Selethen to go after Horace, using Gundar Hardstriker's ship (from books 5 and 6). En route to Ran-Koshi, Horace's party befriends the local woodworkers known as the Kikori. For Halt's party, they encounter a pirate ship but make short work of it. After paying a Kikori village for their hospitality, people from that village catch up and tell the Emperor that a Senshi scouting party destroyed their village. From then on, Kikori of various villages came to join Horace's group on the trek to Ran-Koshi. Halt's group hits Nihon-Ja and they arrive at an inn, making a rendezvous with an ally of the Emperor. Horace, on the other hand, allows Shukin and a few Senshi delay Arisaka's enormous Senshi party of around five-hundred while they buy more time by crossing a bridge and destroying it. In this encounter, Horace drops his sword into a ravine. Halt's group learns of Horace's whereabouts and Horace's group hits Ran-Koshi. Horace's group settles in while Halt's group sails around and enters the plot of land nearest to Ran-Koshi. Halt's group is apprehended by a Kikori scouting patrol, but when presented to Horace, he recognises them and gives them a warm welcome. They set up a large wooden wall to stop Arisaka's army, and in the first day, they manage a victory with about two losses. Horace gets a new sword, which was Shuikin's dying present. The girls, (Cassandra and Alyss) set out across an enormous lake in a kyak to recruit a gigantic tribe of warriors allied with the Emperor: the Hassanu. Will, noting how the Kikori work together excellently, copies the Toscan general at the beginning of the book and forms the same fighting position as he does. They launch an attack against the second Senshi scouting party, and in this encounter, Will manages to intercept a flying arrow and Horace kills the enemy in single combat. Alyss and Cassandra manage to make it to the other side of the giant lake and establish contact with the Hassanu, but they find out that they are not willing to cross a forest en route to Ran-Koshi due to a \\"Demon.\\" Alyss and Cassandra set out to kill the malevolent spirit. Arisaka's main party arrives near Ran-Koshi, but due to heavy snows, wait for spring to begin their assault. Alyss and the Princess discover that the \\"Demon\\" was actually a giant snow tiger, and after a fierce battle, kill it. Spring arrives, and Halt's group attacks Arisaka using their two shield walls. The battle seems evened out until Arisaka's reinforcements arrive. Then, as Will and co. are regrouping, Alyss and Cassandra arrive with the Hassanu. Before a bloody battle can start, the Emperor calls a truce in which they manage to convince everyone, including Arisaka's army, that the Emperor is truly a good man and Arisaka was a power-hungry fool. Arisaka is enraged by this and kills the man nearest to him. Will directly confronts him and kills him with a well- placed throwing knife. On the way back to Araluen, they discuss their nicknames given to them by the Nihon-Jan, with Horace's being Kurokuma (black bear, because he is an eating prowess), Selethen's being Taka (hawk or nose or fighting capability), Alyss's being Tsuru (crane or obvious), Cassandra's being Kitsune (fox, because she's speedy), Halt's being Halto, and Will's being Chocho (Butterfly, because his mind is as nimble as one). On the return trip to Araluen, Horace and Cassandra announce that they are engaged. The book ends with Will making a very, very poor attempt at proposing to Alyss and Alyss marching off in mock indignation. Note: The Nihon-Jan language is basically Japanese using Romaji. They are also explained in the book. =The Lost Stories= The Lost Stories consists of 10 different short stories. It contains a foreword set in July 1896 in Redman County (formerly Redmont Fief) situated in The Republic of Aralan States (formerly the medieval Kingdom of Araluen) where Professor Giles MacFarlane has set up a digging expedition to uncover any important pieces of history. They had unearthed a granite plaque, carved with the likeness of a tusked boar, signifying that the area was once Castle Redmont. In the third season of digging, they had not found anything as important as that first one. The professor was losing hope until one of the young volunteers named Audrey rushed up to him and informed him of a cabin they had found outside the village limits. They discovered a secret compartment in the floor containing an ancient wood and brass chest. The chest contained The Lost Stories of Araluen, which picked up the stories of the Rangers after their return from Nihon-Ja. The main part of The Lost Stories is the text of the Lost Stories (9 short stories), though there is a blurb from The Outcasts. = The Royal Ranger = In The Royal Ranger, Will Treaty tries to cope with the death of Alyss, who died in a fire set in an inn by a gang leader (Jory Ruhl) when she went back inside the burning building to save a young child. Will's friends begin to notice that his once cheerful personality has grown grim and uninviting. After numerous attempts to \\"snap him out of it\\", Gilan, the new Ranger Commandant calls on Halt, Pauline, Cassandra, and Horace to discuss how to deal with Will. Halt suggests that Will take on an apprentice to take his mind off his quest for revenge. Meanwhile, Princess Madelyn, the daughter of Horace and Cassandra, is upset with her restrained royal life. Against the will of her parents, Maddie sneaks out at night to use her sling to hunt small animals. One night, Cassandra and Horace confront Maddie and ground her to her room for a period of two weeks. Halt suggests that Maddie be the one taken on by Will, which would make Maddie the first female Ranger's apprentice in Ranger history. At the beginning of her apprenticeship, Will gives Maddie a letter from her parents, which says she has been disinherited as a princess of Araluen. This is a desperate last resort by her parents to get her under control. Will proceeds to train Maddie, and as he focuses on her, his quest for revenge is slowly forgotten. When Gilan suggests Will take Maddie on a mission, Will accepts without reluctance. Gilan assigns Will and Maddie to investigate the death of Liam, a Ranger in Trelleth Fief, a northwestern fief. Will and Maddie soon discover a plot by an illicit slave ring who kidnaps children. The criminals first send a storyteller to villages that frightens the children with a story about the \\"Stealer in the Night\\". The storyteller seeks out a child who is likely being abused at home and also takes children who aren't quiet about speaking about the Stealer. Will learns that the Stealer in the Night ‚Äî the leader of the slave ring ‚Äî is actually Jory Ruhl, but he manages to set aside his revenge to save the children Ruhl has kidnapped. Will and Maddie go to the slavers' camp, where Will distracts the criminals, while Maddie frees the slaves. Unfortunately, while Maddie is successful in freeing the children, Will is captured, and he is to be burned at the stake. Maddie saves Will but is injured in the process. Will manages to kill Ruhl and treat Maddie's wounds, albeit with severe cramps from when he was tied to the stake. Six months later, Maddie is awarded her Bronze Oakleaf, and Cassandra offers her reinstatement as a princess. However, Maddie declines, saying she wishes to complete her apprenticeship instead. Cassandra is stunned, and the book concludes as Horace explains to her that Rangers have always been different. When Cassandra asks what she should do, Horace replies, \\"Say yes.\\"  Main characters  *Will : His parents deceased, Will grows up as an orphan in the Ward of Castle Redmont along with Alyss, Horace, George and Jenny. After being turned away from Battleschool by Sir Rodney for his small stature, he is taken on as an apprentice by the Ranger Halt. Will is intelligent, inquisitive and athletic, with a natural aptitude for climbing and stealth. He has brown hair that hangs unkempt around his face and deep brown eyes, sometimes mistaken for black. *Alyss : A longtime friend of Will and Horace, she is tall and slender with fair skin, light eyes, and long blonde hair. She has a diplomatic nature and carries herself with poise and grace. She displays sharp wit and cunning and, despite her feminine and gentle nature, holds herself well among her sometimes rough and impulsively passionate friends. *Horace : As a child, Horace had a tendency to pick on Will. He is accepted as an apprentice in Battleschool and shows an uncanny aptitude with the sword. As they age, the spats of their youth fade away and Horace and Will become great friends. He is a straightforward young man both in thought and attitude, favoring honor and displaying the strong ethics brought on by Battleschool training. He has an unparalleled appetite, pointed out on numerous occasions by his friends and much appreciated by Jenny. *Evanlyn/Cassandra : Cassandra, often known by the pseudonym Evanlyn when she wants her identity to remain secret, is the princess of Araluen and daughter of King Duncan. She is short in comparison to Alyss and has honey-colored hair and large green eyes. She quickly befriends Will and Horace, though develops a rivalry with Alyss. She is a natural leader, with an authoritative and often stubborn nature. She is dignified and quick-thinking and never one to shy away from an adventure. She is fiercely loyal to her friends and places great stock in trust and the value of her companions. *Halt : The object of many legends in the Kingdom, Halt prefers to keep to himself. These legends have preceded him and have been exaggerated, as is often so, such that many who meet him are surprised by his short and deceptively unassuming nature. While he is often viewed as standoffish and even dangerous, he enjoys the company of his cheerful and eager apprentice. Halt lives in a cottage at the edge of the fief, cutting his own dark hair with his knife and never seen out of his mottled green Ranger's cloak. His dark beard is flecked with grey. He is sharp and perceptive, maintaining an air of constant vigilance and seriousness. *Gilan : Gilan is Halt's previous apprentice and now a qualified Ranger. Gilan is the son of a well known knight in the kingdom. He was groomed for battle school and trained as a swordsman, though instead chose to become a Ranger. Accordingly, unlike most Rangers, he is an expert swordsman in addition to the bow. He has exceptional skills in stealth. He is very charismatic and known to tease his companions with good- natured humor. *Crowley : Crowley is the commandant of the Ranger Corps and bears many of the same characteristics as Halt. However he does display openly a sense of humor and fondness for his Rangers. He is a master strategist. *Jenny : One of the children who lived at the Ward in Redmont Fief, she is a full-figured, pretty-faced blonde with a bubbly personality and a love for cooking. She becomes an apprentice to the chef Master Chubb and later starts her own restaurant. *Tug : Tug is Will's horse. He is shaggy grey and only slightly larger than a pony, though had been bred for incredible strength, stamina, and intelligence. He is trained to respond to an endless list of commands from his master and the bond between rider and horse is clear in the way that Tug never leaves Will's side.  Publishing history and origins  John Flanagan stated that he first wrote the series as short stories for his son to get him interested in reading. This continued for about 20 weeks. Ten years later, John Flanagan found the stories again and decided to turn them into the first book, The Ruins of Gorlan. However, he never knew that the one book would be able to turn into so many volumes. In 2010 Flanagan was unsure how many volumes in the series he would release, saying \\"I haven't set a limit. If I have an idea that will progress the characters, I'll write it. But I don't want to find myself jumping up and down on the same spot, as it were.\\" The inspiration for the series comes from many sources, including family, friends, and European times. Rangers are based on two groups of people, the Texas Rangers and the US Army Rangers of World War II. Although the US Rangers were based on British Commandos, Flanagan felt it would be better to use Rangers because of the medieval setting of the book. The mythical world of the story is based on England, Europe, and Scandinavia because Flanagan was inspired by \\"English and European culture and history\\". Besides this, John Flanagan is also interested in military subjects, which helped him write the battle scenes. Celtica's mining culture is like Wales while Gallica takes its name and language from medieval France in its chivalric age around the year 1300. Some of the books' characters were based on Flanagan's family and friends. Will was based on Flanagan's son Michael; both are agile, quick and quite short. John Flanagan also made Will small in size because he wanted to show his son that there's an advantage to being small. The exchanges between Halt and Will are taken from conversations between Flanagan and his son as a teenager. Horace was inspired by Michael's best friend Jeremey. In the original story however, Flanagan made Horace a villain at first, but then in the first book, Morgarath became the real villain and Horace was \\"rehabilitated\\" as a main character. Skandians were taken from Norse culture and Vikings, which Flanagan found interesting as a child. The gods and deities of the Skandians were taken from Norse mythology and Greek mythology. The god Loka mentioned a few times is based on Loki, the god of deceit. The Vallas, the trio of gods, are based on the Moirai. =Sales= Rights to sell Ranger's Apprentice have gone to 16 countries including North America (where Oakleaf Bearers is better known as The Battle for Skandia), the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark and Sweden. In Australia, the seventh book, Erak's Ransom, reached number two on Australian children's charts. The series has been on The New York Times Best Seller list for 77 weeks as of 13 December 2013. By 2010, over 2 million copies had been sold. Themes John Flanagan states in an interview that the main theme is, \\"the eventual triumph of good over evil.\\" He feels that although it does not always happen in real life, it should. Another theme especially prominent throughout Oakleaf Bearers is \\"the primacy of personal relationships over loyalties to one's country or duty.\\" This is shown when Erak's friendship helps Will and Evanlyn escape which allows the Araluens and Skandians to drive away the Temujai. Other themes include courage, loyalty, and that a person can do anything if they tried hard enough. One review noted that \\"themes of loyalty, bravery, endurance and friendship leave young readers in safe hands as they learn to navigate dangerous waters on their own.\\" Camp In 2010, BookPeople, which also created Camp Half-Blood from Percy Jackson & the Olympians, created a Ranger's Apprentice Corps Training Camp based on the books. A total of 75 kids from the ages of 9‚Äì12 were chosen from 1,300 entries. A letter was sent to the kids from the voice of Will, actually written by John Flanagan, which stated they would learn \\"all the skills I was taught by Halt [Will's Ranger mentor] in the woods around Castle Redmont\\", including \\"archery, tracking, and the art of concealment and unseen movement.\\" The 75 campers were divided into 12 fiefdoms where they were taught the skills and at the end, every kid received a T-shirt, a silver oak leaf pin, and a gold-embossed Ranger's Apprentice bookmark. This was the first literary camp that has sold out and has a waiting list besides Camp Half-Blood. Reception Ranger's Apprentice has been well received by many reviewers. One part many reviewers praised was the vivid details during battles. Another review also praised the imagery and stated, \\"vivid imagery and detail make the medieval-like elements believable\\" A review for The Ruins of Gorlan stated, \\"filled with rich detail and plenty of edge-of-your-seat thrills\\" again praising the details. Another aspect commonly praised is the fact that Will, the main protagonist still asks for the help of others. A review for The Icebound Land stated the same thing writing, \\"Though talented and intelligent, [Will] makes mistakes and he often needs help from those around himmaking him a very realistic and appealing protagonist.\\" One reviewer from Booklist noted that although in The Burning Bridge the point of view constantly shifted, it is not confusing and also stated, \\"Will's vivid world will entice fantasy readers who are drawn by the lure of high adventure carried out by believable, down-to-earth heroes.\\" In another review by School Library Journal, the review was on Oakleaf Bearers and praised the book on the high tensions raised and recommended it to people who enjoy action and adventure. However, not all reviews were completely positive. One reviewer thought that the Wargals sounded and were too alike to Urgals in the Inheritance Cycle. The same reviewer also felt that the story was not very original stating, \\"from the very beginning, it was a story I'd heard before.\\" At the end the reviewer stated, \\"The books aren't horrible. They're just nothing new.\\" In a review for The Ruins of Gorlan, the reviewer stated \\"the pace is a good balance between character development and action, and the rivalry between Horace and Will is developed in a satisfactory way.\\" It also praised how the writing is very descriptive without being dry or slow. =Awards= The Ranger's Apprentice series has won numerous awards. The series was one of the honour books for the Koala Winners in 2009. The seventh book, Erak's Ransom, was chosen as the Books of the Year for Older Children and the International Success Award. The first and fourth books won the Aurealis Awards while the third book was highly commended. Then, the first, second and fifth book each earned the Children's Book Council of Australia Notable Book. The first book was also the Longlisted for the Ottakar's Book Prize for 2006‚Äì2007 and the first book also was nominated for the Grand Canyon Reader Award in 2008. Film adaptation , Warner Bros. Pictures has optioned the film rights for The Ruins of Gorlan and is in talks with Oscar-winning filmmaker Paul Haggis to adapt and direct the film. When John Flanagan first heard the news he said: > It's just so overwhelming to see that the Ranger's series is set to head off > in yet another exciting direction. When I think how this all started as a > series of twenty short stories written for my son Michael, it sets my head > spinning to think there's the distinct possibility that it will now be > translated into movies and seen by millions of people around the world. John Flanagan stated in a Facebook Q&A; that the funds for the film have been acquired and auditions would be held in the summer of 2015, in either Ireland or England. In March 2016 it was announced production would start late that year. Film Carnival decided to fund the company with 500 million USD, but later pulled out therefore ending the production. , it was announced that Dick Cook Studios (DCS), an independent production company helmed by former Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook, will receive $20,473,020 from the Australian government to produce two fantasy features in the country. The first of which will be Ranger's Apprentice. Production is said to start July 2020. Flanagan later stated that the producers had opted for a TV series instead of a movie, and that production was delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBGMtSJT4vA&feature;=youtu.be&t;=1922 References External links * Official Australian Ranger's Apprentice website * Author's Ranger's Apprentice website * UK publisher's Ranger's Apprentice website *Official Forum Fantasy novel series Young adult novel series COOL Award-winning works ","title":"Ranger's Apprentice"},{"id":"5750245","text":"PropBank is a corpus that is annotated with verbal propositions and their arguments--a \\"proposition bank\\". Although \\"PropBank\\" refers to a specific corpus produced by Martha Palmer et al., the term propbank is also coming to be used as a common noun referring to any corpus that has been annotated with propositions and their arguments. The PropBank project has played a role in recent research in natural language processing, and has been used in semantic role labelling. Comparison PropBank differs from FrameNet, the resource to which it is most frequently compared, in several ways. PropBank is a verb- oriented resource, while FrameNet is centered on the more abstract notion of frames, which generalizes descriptions across similar verbs (e.g. \\"describe\\" and \\"characterize\\") as well as nouns and other words (e.g. \\"description\\"). PropBank does not annotate events or states of affairs described using nouns. PropBank commits to annotating all verbs in a corpus, whereas the FrameNet project chooses sets of example sentences from a large corpus and only in a few cases has annotated longer continuous stretches of text. PropBank-style annotations often remain close to the syntactic level, while FrameNet-style annotations are sometimes more semantically motivated. From the start, PropBank was developed with the idea of serving as training data for machine learning-based semantic role labeling systems in mind. It requires that all arguments to a verb be syntactic constituents and different senses of a word are only distinguished if the differences bear on the arguments. Due to such differences, semantic role labeling with respect to PropBank is often a somewhat easier task than producing FrameNet-style annotations.

He was the minister of youth and sports in the cabinet of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. From February to November 2006 he was the interim interior minister. He is seen as being opposed to Syrian involvement in Lebanon. Early life and education Born to one of the biggest families in S√Ær ed Dann√Æy√©, Miniyeh‚ÄìDanniyeh District, Fatfat holds a degree in medicine. Career Fatfat first emerged onto the Lebanese political scene as a candidate for the Lebanese Parliament in the first parliamentary elections in Lebanon after the end of the Lebanese civil war, in 1992. Fatfat failed to reach parliament that year, but succeeded in the next elections in 1996 with backing from Rafik Hariri and his Future Movement. Fatfat was re-elected to office in 2000, breaking into parliament as the highest vote-getter in his district of Dannyieh, North Lebanon. As the Future Movement's candidate he defeated future vice prime minister Issam Fares with a large margin. Fatfat's activism and involvement with Hariri, and his more vocal role during the turbulent period following the assassination of Hariri, catapulted him along with all the March 14 Alliance candidates to a sweep of all of North Lebanon's 28 parliamentary seats. In June 2005, Fatfat was appointed as the minister of youth and sports to Fouad Siniora's first cabinet. On 5 February 2006, after the resignation of Hassan Sabeh, he became interim interior minister, a position he held until 14 November of the same year when Sabeh reclaimed his office following the assassination of industry minister Pierre Amine Gemayel. Following the burning of the Danish embassy and of several churches in East Beirut's Christian boroughs in February 2006 (at the time of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy), Fatfat accused \\"radical Shiite elements\\" and \\"Christian troublemakers allied with the Syrian regime\\". He later had to retract this statement when it turned out that all of the anti-Christian rioters arrested on that day by the Lebanese police were radical Sunni Islamists, many of them members of minister Fatfat's own Future Movement.Sources: Nouvel Observateur, 8 February 2006. During the 2006 Israel- Lebanon conflict Minister Fatfat was accused of helping Israel forces in the south, but later the opposition ministers refused to move the accusation to trial which proved that this whole accusation was false.\\"CNN:Video provokes questions of Lebanese army This episode is often ridiculed by Fatfat's political opponents. In the same year, Fatfat caused large controversy over his approval of Hizb ut-Tahrir's right to operate openly in Lebanon and call for the re-establishment of the Islamic Caliphate in the Islamic world. On 15 June 2007, two Lebanese news anchors from the Lebanese television station NBN owned by Nabih Berri were sacked after being overheard saying that, in the wake of the murder of Walid Eido, Fatfat would \\"be next.\\" Apparently unaware that their microphones were still on, a female news anchor was heard saying \\"Ahmed Fatfat will be next.

These were the electrically powered Sd.Kfz. 302 and the petrol-engine powered Sd.Kfz. 303a and 303b. They were known as beetle tanks by the Allies. Employed by the Wehrmacht during World War II. They carried 60 or 100 kilograms (130 or 220 lb) of high explosives, depending on the model, and were intended to be used for multiple purposes, such as destroying tanks, disrupting dense infantry formations, and the demolition of buildings or bridges. Goliaths were single-use vehicles that were destroyed by the detonation of their warhead. Development thumbleftThe interior of a Goliath, SdKfz. 303, showing the petrol engine, control cable reels and the space for the warhead. U.S. Department of Ordnance - Catalog of Enemy Ordnance Manual Vol. 1 - 1945 During and after World War I, a number of inventors devised small, remote-controlled, tracked vehicles intended to carry an explosive charge. During the war, the French developed two vehicles. The Crocodile Schneider Torpille Terrestre or https://weaponews.com/weapons/13708-land-torpedo-crocodile-schneider- france.htmlLand Torpedo Crocodile Schneider carried a 40-kilogram (88 lb) explosive charge and saw limited combat use in June 1916. However, it performed poorly and was eclipsed by the first tanks, then being introduced.Everett and Toscano (2015) p.412 The Aubriot-Gabet Torpille Electrique was driven by a single electric motor powered by a trailing cable. This vehicle may have been steered by clutch control on its tracks, although early versions may have lacked steering. This may not have mattered as its task was simply to cross No man's land to attack the long trenches of the enemy. The Wickersham Land Torpedo was patented by American inventor Elmer Wickersham in 1918 and in the 1930s, a similar vehicle was developed by the French vehicle designer Adolphe K√©gresse. In late 1940, K√©gresse's prototype was recovered by the Germans near the Seine; the Wehrmacht's ordnance office directed the Carl F.W. Borgward automotive company of Bremen, Germany to develop a similar vehicle for the purpose of carrying a minimum of 50 kilograms (110 lb) of explosives. The result was the SdKfz. 302 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug, ‚Äòspecial-purpose vehicle‚Äô), called the Leichter Ladungstr√§ger (‚Äòlight charge carrier‚Äô), or Goliath, which carried 60 kilograms (130 lb) of explosives. The vehicle was steered remotely via a joystick control box. The control box was connected to the Goliath by a , triple-strand cable attached to the rear of the vehicle. The cable was used both for control and for transmitting power to the electric driven version. Two of the strands were used to move and steer the Goliath, while the third was used for detonation. Each Goliath was disposable, being intended to be blown up with its target. Early model Goliaths used an electric motor but, as these were costly to make (3,000 Reichsmarks) and difficult to repair in a combat environment, later models (known as the SdKfz. 303) used a simpler, more reliable gasoline engine. Service German soldiers with a Goliath and its remote control, Russia (April 1944) Goliaths were used on all fronts where the Wehrmacht fought, beginning in early 1942. They were used principally by specialized Panzer and combat engineer units. Goliaths were used at Anzio in Italy in April 1944, and against the Polish resistance during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. A few Goliaths were also seen on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day, though most were rendered inoperative due to artillery blasts severing their command cables. Allied troops also encountered a small number of Goliaths in the Maritime Alps following the landings in southern France in August 1944, with at least one being used successfully against a vehicle of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion. Although a total of 7,564 Goliaths were produced, the single-use weapon was not considered a success due to high unit cost, low speed (just above ), poor ground clearance (just 11.4 centimetres), the vulnerable control cable, and thin armour which could not protect the vehicle from small-arms fire. The Goliath was also too big and heavy to be easily man-portable. Mostly, they failed to reach their target although the effect was considerable when they did.Everett and Toscano (2015) p.489 Large numbers of Goliaths were captured by the Allies. Although they were examined with interest by Allied intelligence, they were seen as having little military value. Some were used by the United States Army Air Force as aircraft tugs, although they quickly broke down as the disposable vehicles were not designed for sustained use. The Goliath did help lay the foundation for post-war advances in remote-controlled vehicle technologies. Romanian version During 1944, Romania designed and built its own model of remote- controlled tracked mine, known as \\"Romanian Goliath\\", due to lack of information about its actual name. However, it was markedly different from its German counterpart. The few surviving photos show that the vehicle had no armour, and it is not known if that was ever changed. It did have some logistical improvements, however, as the Romanian-designed chassis allowed it to cross trenches and craters much better than its German counterparts. Little is known about the vehicle, aside from that it never went beyond the prototype stage and that it weighed about two tonnes.Romanian Goliath (Russian) Surviving examples A Goliath 303 displayed at the Bovington Tank Museum Surviving Goliaths are preserved at: * The Museum of World War II, Massachusetts, USA * The :de:Museum Stammheim, Germany * the Deutsches Panzermuseum, Germany * the Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden, Germany * The T√∏jhus Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark * Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna, Austria * the Mus√©e du D√©barquement Utah Beach, Normandy, France * Mus√©e des Blind√©s, Saumur, France * Musee No. 4 Commando, Ouistreham, Normandy, France * the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada * Fort Garry Horse Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada * United States Army Ordnance Museum * Karl Smith collection, USA * the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, UK * The Tank Museum, Bovington Camp, UK * The REME Museum, UK * Dutch Cavalry Museum, Netherlands * War Museum Overloon, Netherlands * Het Nederlands kustverdedigingsmuseum: Fort Hoek van Holland Netherlands www.forthvh.nl * Het Memory Oorlogs- en Vredesmuseum Nijverdal, Netherlands * Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History, Belgium * December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium * the Kubinka Tank Museum, Russia * Arsena≈Ç in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland * Polish Army Museum, Poland * Warsaw Uprising Museum, Poland * Muzeum dopravy (transportation museum), Bratislava, Slovakia. * Swedish Army Museum, Stockholm, Sweden * Friends' Association of the Scientific Collection of Defence Engineering Specimens Koblenz (VFF WTS), Koblenz, Germany https://www.vffwts.de/en/ * The Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum, Everett, Washington, USA See also *Teletank, a series of Soviet remote controlled tanks *Mobile Land Mine, equivalent British World War 2 vehicle; fifty built. *Springer (tank) *Borgward IV *Unmanned ground vehicle Notes Defence against the German Goliath was re-enacted in the 1957 Polish film Kana≈Ç, documenting the final days of the Warsaw Uprising, the TV series Kolumbowie and the 2014 film Warsaw 44.

The SADT is the point at which the heat evolution from the decomposition reaction and the heat removal rate from the package of interest become unbalanced. When the heat removal is too low, the temperature in the package increases and the rate of decomposition increases in an uncontrollable manner. The result is therefore dependent on the formulation and the package characteristics. A self-accelerating decomposition occurs when the rate of peroxide decomposition is sufficient to generate heat at a faster rate than it can be dissipated to the environment. Temperature is the main factor in determining the decomposition rate, although the size of the package is also important since its dimensions will determine the ability to dissipate heat to the environment. All peroxides contain an oxygen-oxygen bond that, on heating, can break apart homolytically to generate two radicals. As mentioned previously, this decomposition also generates heat. But the stability of the oxygen-oxygen bond is dependent on what else is present in the molecule. Some peroxides, due to their chemical make-up, are very unstable and need to be refrigerated to avoid a self-accelerating decomposition. Others, particularly those used for crosslinking purposes, are much more stable and can be stored at normal ambient temperatures without risk of self-acceleration. Due to the large variations in the stabilities of peroxides, each is tested to determine the safe maximum temperature for which the peroxide may be stored, shipped, and handled. The result of this test is the self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT). Although a number of organic peroxides can safely be stored at room temperature, most require some form of temperature control. For long storage periods, the organic peroxide is usually kept at a lower temperature than the maximum safe storage temperature as determined by the SADT. The SADT for an organic peroxide formulation is usually lower for more concentrated formulations. Dilution with a compatible, high boiling point diluent will usually increase the SADT since the peroxide is dilute and the diluent can absorb much of the heat minimizing the increase in temperature. Also, for an organic peroxide formulation, larger packages generally have a lower SADT because of the poorer heat transfer of the larger package due to lower surface area to volume ratio. Most organic peroxides react to some extent with their decomposition products during thermal decomposition. This often increases the rate since the decomposition proceeds more rapidly as the decomposition products are generated. The SADT measurement is made as follows: * The package containing the peroxide is placed in oven set for test temperature * The timer starts when product reaches 2 ¬∞C below intended test temperature * The oven is held at constant temperature for up to one week or, until a runaway event occurs. * Test \\"Passes\\" if product does not exceed test (oven) temperature by 6 ¬∞C within one week * Test \\"Fails\\" if product exceeds test temperature by 6 ¬∞C within one week * The test is repeated in 5 ¬∞C increments until a failure is reached * Fail temperature is reported as SADT for that package and formulation * Secondary information about the violence of the decomposition can also be recorded As an alternative to the oven test the SADT for larger packages can be determined by substituting a Dewar flask for the package. The heat transfer of the Dewar flask can be matched to the heat transfer of a larger package size. This test is called the Heat Accumulation Storage Test (HAST).  Application to polymerizable mixtures  Some mixtures containing peroxides and polymerizable monomers may also exhibit SADTs. For example, mixtures of vinyltrimethoxysilane, peroxides and stabilizers are used commercially for cross-linking polyethylene to make PEX pipe. These mixtures are typically liquid solutions that are shipped to where they are used to graft alkoxysilane groups to polyethylene. In such mixtures decomposition of the peroxide can initiate exothermic radical polymerization of the vinyltrimethoxysilane. At low temperature the decomposition rate is slow enough that the stabilizers quench the polymerization before much heat is generated and the container dissipates what heat is produced. At higher temperatures peroxide decomposition is faster, more polymerization occurs to heat the mixture, which in turn increases peroxide decomposition and polymerizes the monomer even faster. The container dissipates heat more slowly in a higher-temperature environment, so at some critical temperature heat is generated by polymerization faster than the container can dissipate it and the reaction self-accelerates. Thus such a mixture has a SADT that depends on container size exactly as in the case of a pure organic peroxide.  Results  When thermal decomposition occurs some organic peroxide formulations release a considerable amount of gases and/or mists. Some, but not all, of these gases may be flammable. For example, carbon dioxide is a common, gaseous decomposition product for diacyl peroxides and peresters that is not flammable. The decomposition may include small organic fragments such as methane or acetone which are flammable. When flammable gases or mists are released as part of the decomposition there is always the potential danger of a fire or vapor phase explosion. Therefore, the risk of vapor phase explosion should be kept in mind when designing storage structures. These types of materials may be released at low rates during storage and in quite high rates in the event of an upset due to failure to control storage temperature or in the event of a fire in the storage area. It is the ease of splitting the peroxy group to give two free radicals that makes organic peroxides so useful. However, the presence of energetic free radicals during decomposition, particularly in hot gases or mists, can cause auto-ignition to occur at a lower temperature than would otherwise be normal for a similar chemical structure without the peroxy functional group. Organic peroxides do not generally consume oxygen as part of the decomposition so there is little risk of enhanced burning rates due to oxygen enrichment. This is unlike the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and solid oxidizers that can liberate oxygen.

The intent of the ius trium liberorum had led scholars to interpret it as eugenic legislation.Field, pg. 398-399 This interpretation is long outdated, however. Most current scholarship sees the law as a politically-motivated effort to increase birth rates among the senatorial class.Kaius Tuori \\"Augustus, Legislative Power, and the Power of Appearances,\\" in Fundaminia 20:2 2014, 942-3 Men who had received the jus trium liberorum were excused from munera (compulsory services). Women with jus trium liberorum were no longer subject to tutela mulierum (guardianship by a male relative) and could receive inheritances which would otherwise descend to their children.Berger, pg. 530 The senatorial reaction to the jus trium liberorum was largely to find loopholes, however. The prospect of having a large family was still not appealing.Field, pg. 408 A person who caught a citizen in violation in this law was entitled to a portion of the inheritance involved, creating a lucrative business for professional spies.Yue, pg. 686 The spies became so pervasive that the reward was reduced to a quarter of its previous size.Field, pg. 412 As time went on, the ius trium liberorum was granted by consuls to some citizens as rewards for general good deeds, holding important professions or as personal favors, not just prolific propagation.Field, pg. 408 Eventually the ius trium liberorum was repealed in 534 AD by Justinian.Field, pg. 398 Background During the Augustan period the upper classes, the senatorial and equestrian orders, were diminishing in number. These classes formed the backbone of the state, forming the empire's civil and military administration. The classes‚Äô populations had been affected by the recent civil wars, proscription, and most importantly, low birth rates within the classes. The decrease in birth rate was even more dramatic than is typical for the increase in Rome's development.Field, pg. 399 The Lex Iulia and the Papia Poppaea had been able to increase marriage rates within the upper classes, but the birthrate had not increased enough through these bodies of legislation alone. For this reason the jus trium liberorum was enacted.Field, pg. 402 =Eugenic implications= It is important to note that Italy's population as a whole was not decreasing. In fact, it may have been increasing. The growth in population was largely due to the influx of slaves from outside of Italy, especially Eastern Europe. The jus trium liberorum, therefore, has been called a eugenic measure by scholars as it specifically worked toward increasing a specific population deemed desirable.Field, pg. 398 - 399 It is argued that the aspect of population growth in the jus trium liberorum was a secondary intention.Field, pg. 414 It is important that the jus trium liberorum is kept in the context of the Lex Iulia and the Papia Poppaea, which dealt with issues concerning racial purity within these classes, like appropriate marriage partners.Berger, pg. 553 - 554 James A Field equated the jus trium liberorum to the Third Reich‚Äôs decree by which a Jew might become an honorary Aryan in his article \\"The Purpose of the Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea.\\"pg. 408 Legal specifics The jus trium liberorum was a reward gained by compliance with the Lex Iulia and Papia Poppea. The privilege concerned both genders, but impacted women more than men. The specifics of the jus trium liberorum is defined as follows in Adolf Berger's Encyclopedia of Roman Law: > Fathers might claim exemption (excusatio) from public charges and from > guardianship to which they were called by law (tutela legitima). The most > important application of jus liberorum concerned women. A freeborn woman > with three children and a freedwoman with four children (jus trium vel > quattuor liberorum) were freed from guardianship to which women were subject > (tutela mulierum) and had a right of succession to the inheritance of their > children. The women‚Äôs jus liberorum was applied even when the children were > no longer alive.Berger, pg. 530 In short this meant that a man could not be forced to take over the obligation of guardianship of a woman, legally a minor, that he would otherwise be obligated under the tutela mulierum.Yue, pg. 683 Women who had the appropriate number of children no longer needed to have a guardian as they would under the tutela mulierum. This meant that when a woman was no longer subject to the power of her father (patria potestas) or her husband (manus) she could act independently.Berger, pg. 748 She also gained the right to inheritance that would have otherwise been awarded to her children. Often this meant that she inherited and owned her husband's estate upon his death.Field, pg. 408 As stated above children did not need to be alive for them to count toward the jus liberorum. Legitimate children were counted for men and women. Children born to an unknown father (spurius) did count toward a woman's number of children under the jus trium liberorum.Berger, pg. 714 A child considered to be a portentum (literally a monster or monstrous beingPerseus Digital Library Project) was not considered to be a human but still counted toward the mother's number of children under the jus trium liberorum. Both parents could count a child deemed a portentum under the laws against childless parents in the Lex Iulia and Papia Poppaea, however.Berger, 636 Impact After being enacted this right was considered valuable, but it soon became a privilege unconnected with three or more births to a citizen. Many people did not want the burden of children, but still sought the jus trium liberorum. This enticed many people to exploit loopholes in the law, which was often accomplished through illegal means. A reward consisting of a percentage of the inheritance involved was offered for spies who caught others illegally benefitting from the jus trium liberorum. This reward created a large number of spies due to the lucrative rewards. To reduce the problem of spies the reward was then reduced to a quarter of its previous size.Field, pg. 412 - 413 The jus trium liberorum was also awarded to people in no connection with their number of offspring as a reward by the emperor. Often it was awarded in connection with a good deed, military service or as a personal favor.Field, pg. 408 Many famous Romans were awarded the jus trium liberorum including Suetonius through a personal favor from Trajan to Pliny the Younger,Dunham, pg. 421 - 422 Martial by Domitian in reward to Martial's flattery,Clarke, pg. 47 and to Livia in response of the death of Drusus in 9 BCE.Field, pg. 408 Owners of large ships were also granted the jus trium liberorum under the Empire.Berger, 592 - 593 The jus trium liberorum was eventually repealed by Justinian in 534 CE.Field, pg. 398 Notes Bibliography NOTE: Most of this scholarship is grossly outdated, serious revisions to both the entry and the scholarship used is recommended *Berger, Adolf. \\"Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law.\\" Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. ns. 43.2 (1953) *Clarke, M.

It was released in Australia on 5 May 2005. Plot summary In the prologue, Halt (a legendary Ranger) sees Dirk Reacher, one of Morgarath's allies, give him a plan. Halt thinks about this, but eventually decides it's true. Meanwhile, on a special mission for the Ranger Corps, Will (the protagonist and Halt's apprentice), his friend Horace (a Battleschool apprentice), and the Ranger Gilan (another of Halt's former apprentices) travel to Celtica, a neighbouring country southwest of Araluen. When they ride to Celtica, they discover that all the people in the villages have mysteriously vanished. Will and Horace wonder if all the villagers have been slain or captured, but Gilan believes that the evil Lord Morgarath devised a plan to cross the mountain pass faster. If that was true, and the King wasn't warned, the country would be destroyed. Gilan rides to warn King Duncan, the King of Araluen, and Will and Horace begin to follow a straggling Wargal force. On their way, they come across an abandoned girl named Evanlyn, who claims to be a maid to a lady of the Araluen court, but is actually the Princess herself in disguise. When the three of them follow the dimwitted Wargals they discover that a gargantuan bridge is in the process of being built across the impassable Fissure for their war party to cross. They also discover that the King's army will be trapped on the Plains of Uthal, because the plans that Halt captured in the prologue of the book were merely a ruse to distract them. Will burns the bridge with Evanlyn's help. Evanlyn tries to warn Will about a rock thrown by a Skandian but is too late, giving a chance for a Skandian to grab them. Will and Evanlyn are taken captive by the group of Skandians ruled by Jarl Erak, but Horace is able to escape their grasp. After, he tells the King and his aides about what is going to happen, the army starts to get prepared for the army that is supposed to attack them from behind, Halt is sent to take care of them with a force of cavalry and archer units (an archer and pikeman). In the middle of the battle, Morgarath calls a truce and challenges Halt to a duel, but King Duncan forbids it to happen. Then, unexpectedly, Horace challenges Morgarath to single combat. About to be defeated by Morgarath, Horace then, in a last-ditch attempt to win the battle, throws himself into the path of the battle horse, to throw it off balance. He is successful, but only manages to wind Morgarath. Morgarath is confident that he is going to win by a last powerful stroke of his broadsword, but Horace blocks it with the double-knife defence that Gilan taught Will and stabs Morgarath in the heart to win the battle. The Wargals become harmless as soon as Morgarath dies and the mind domination is broken. Immediately Halt goes looking for Will and Cassandra but he is too late. The Skandians sail for Skandia to sell Will and Princess Cassandra as slaves.

It is also the eastern end of a highway known as the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway, one of three coast-to-coast Interstates, along with I-80 and I-90. The highway runs east from the Alabama border, traveling through the Panhandle of Florida, serving the major cities of Pensacola, Tallahassee, Lake City, ending at Jacksonville, and carries the hidden Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) designation of State Road 8 (SR 8). Route description Eastbound view of I-10 near Lake City and I-75 The Interstate runs roughly parallel to US Highway 90 (US 90), but is a more direct route, bypassing the central cores of many cities. I-10 runs through some of the least populated areas of the state. The western terminus of I-10 is the Florida‚ÄìAlabama state line at the Perdido River, just west of Pensacola, in Escambia County. Exit 7A, SR 297 (southbound), gives access to the Pensacola Naval Air Station and the National Museum of Naval Aviation. On the border between Brent and Ensley, the median approaching exits 10A and 10B become unexpectedly wide in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps from US 29 that enter the left sides of the road. At exit 12, I-10 serves as the northern terminus of I-110, a spur route to central Pensacola. The route leaves the county at the Escambia Bay Bridge and has two interchanges within Santa Rosa County before crossing another bridge over the Blackwater River. After that bridge it has two more interchanges with a pair of rest areas in between before crossing the Santa Rosa‚ÄìOkaloosa County line. The road crosses the border between the Central and Eastern time zones at the long Dewey M. Johnson Bridge, over the Apalachicola River. East of the bridge over the Ochlockonee River and the rest areas that follow, I-10 widens from four to six lanes and remains that way until after the interchange with SR 61 and US 319\\\\. Like at US 29 in Escambia County, the median for I-10 widens in the vicinity of I-75 at exits 296A and 296B in order to accommodate flyover on-ramps that enter from the left sides of the road. A segment between exits 303 and 324 contains no interchanges because it passes through a portion of Osceola National Forest. The sole means of leaving and re-entering the highway in this section is at a pair of rest areas, the easternmost rest areas along I-10. The road widens to six lanes again at the interchange with the First Coast Expressway. Just as I-75 did with I-10 in Columbia County, I-10's interchange with I-295 uses single ramps leading to both directions on I-295 with east-to-north and south-to-west flyover ramps leading to the median of I-295. US 17 overlaps I-10 for two exits before the eastern terminus of the Interstate, located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Jacksonville's urban core at I-95. History =Construction= I-10 west at the interchange for US 17 Alt. south in Jacksonville Prior to the construction of I-10, US 90 was the main east‚Äìwest highway across the state. The first section of I-10 in Florida was completed between Sanderson and Jacksonville in 1961. Construction on points westward continued in 1962. The route between Sanderson and Winfield was completed in 1963. By 1967, construction had been completed from the Alabama state line to SR 87, and was under construction from Falmouth to I-75. New construction extending I-10 east from SR 87 to Mossy Head began in 1968. The Falmouth to I-75 segment opened in 1969. Construction began in 1970 further extending I-10 eastward from Mossy Head to DeFuniak Springs. New construction began in 1973 from DeFuniak Springs to Caryville and from Drifton to Capitola; the segment between Drifton and Falmouth opened that year. The Capitola‚ÄìDrifton segment was completed the following year. Construction began between Caryville and Chipley in 1974, and from Chipley to Midway in 1975. The segment between Chipley and Midway was completed in 1977 except for a small portion between Kynesville and Oakdale; in 1978, the entire length of I-10, as well as the I-110 spur in Pensacola across the state opened along its original planned route. During the planning stage of construction, I-10 was placed just north of the central business district of Tallahassee, roughly along the current route of US 90 through town, while later a spur route was proposed to go to the core of the city. Both of these proposals were dropped and a route across the north side of the city was chosen. In 2008 the Interstate stretch in Tallahassee was expanded to six lanes to alleviate congestion. In 2002, I-10, along with most of Florida's Interstates, switched over from a sequential exit numbering system to a mileage-based exit numbering system. =Rest area security concerns= I-10 west approaching the interchange for US 319/SR 61 in Tallahassee In 1993, a British tourist was killed at the Jefferson County rest area in a botched burglary by teens. As a result, Florida rest stops were either patrolled or closed for at least two years when lawmakers approved cut- backs. A number of rest areas are currently regularly patrolled at night by armed security, often private, due to a resurgence in rest area-related violent crime. =Hurricane Ivan= On September 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan made landfall near Pensacola, with the resulting storm surge causing heavy damage to the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay. As much as a quarter mile () of the bridge, consisting of 58 bridge segments, collapsed into the bay, and an additional 66 segments were knocked out of alignment; most of the damage was to the eastbound lanes. A $26.5 million project was awarded the following day to Gilbert Southern/Massman and to the Parsons Corporation to make emergency repairs to the bridge. Work was completed on October 4 on the westbound bridge, restoring two-way traffic seven days ahead of schedule. The more heavily damaged eastbound bridge was completely repaired on November 20, just 66 days after Hurricane Ivan made landfall, and 27 days ahead of schedule. The contractor received $1.5 million in bonuses for the early completion. The commercial truck detour sent truck traffic into Alabama and I-65 to avoid the bridges. The causeway that carries US 90 across the northern part of the same bay was also heavily damaged.

Biography His birth year is unknown to us, but scholarly estimates point to 1320s or early 1330s at latest. He was born as the son of the first marriage of knight Ulf Abj√∂rnson of Engso, justiciar of Tioh√§rad (d. 1347) with Kristina Sigmundsdotter of the family of Tre Kl√∂verblad. His and his father's Coat of Arms was a chevron ('spar') wherefore this family is regarded as one of numerous medieval Scandinavian families retrospectively named Sparre. Through his paternal grandmother, Charles was a descendant of the Ulv branch of the House of Bjelbo (Folkunga√§tten) and numbered some ancient Swedish earls among his ancestors. Charles was literate and studied in Paris. Charles was knighted between 1354‚Äì58. He was summoned to the membership of the High Council of Sweden from 1356 at latest. He also acted as lawspeaker of Uppland from no later than 1362. His step-mother M√§rta Sunadotter of Hultboda, heiress of Fogelvik, was sister of Erengisle Sunason of Hultboda, Earl of Orkney. From 1356, they supported the efforts of King Erix XII of Sweden to rise to equal rulership with, or to depose, his father King Magnus IV of Sweden. His half-sister Ingeborg Ulfsdotter was in early 1350s married to a young nobleman, Benedict, Duke of Halland (c. 1330 ‚Äì c. 1360). He was a favorite of King Magnus IV of Sweden. However the royal favorite was under increasing attacks and dissatisfaction from the party of high nobility. Benedict repudiated Duchess Ingeborg sometime in c. 1356. In 1360, Charles was with troops in Scania. Benedict was besieged at R√∂nneholm Castle (R√∂nneholms slott). Reportedly Charles personally took part in killing him. Charles supported King Albert III of Mecklenburg. In Albert's reign, Charles was Lord High Constable of Sweden (Riksmarsk) of Sweden 1364-71. He however accepted Queen Margaret's rule when she had deposed Albert in 1388-89. Albert had appointed him as the castellan of Viipuri (see margrave of Viipuri) sometime in the 1380s. He continued in this responsible and very autonomous position over the change of ruler until 1399. Personal life He was married several times, possibly as many as five, but had limited success in siring surviving children. With his first wife (wed 6 May 1352) Ingrid Eriksdotter of Boberg, daughter of Erik of Boberg (Erik Larsson), and his wife Birgitta Knutsdotter who was a daughter of knight Knut Folkason of the Algotss√∂ner, son of Ingrid Svantepolksdotter, he had a son, Knut Karlson of Tofta, the only son who survived to adulthood. Knut also was knighted and was from 1376 justiciar of S√∂dermanland, but predeceased his father, dying probably in 1389 and was apparently unmarried and childless. Charles' second wife (from 1363) was Helena Israelsdotter of Finsta, who died ca. 1375. She was the daughter of Israel Birgersson of Finsta, justiciar of Uppland. Helena was sister of Charles' first cousin Philip Nielson of Salsta's wife Ramborg Israelsdotter of Finsta. There are no indications of any surviving children of either marriage. His third wife was a Cecilia. The fourth, and the possible fifth, wife's names are unknown to us, but one of them bore him a daughter, Margareta Karlsdotter of Tofta, sometime around the 1380s or early 1390s. Charles inherited in ca. 1389 from his son who had inherited a sizable property from his maternal kin. Also in ca. 1389, Charles inherited from his half-sister, Kristina Ulvsdotter, heiress of Fogelvik, widow of lord Peder Ribbing and of Niels of Rickeby, heiress of her sister Duchess Ingeborg of Halland and Finland, and her mother M√§rta Sunadotter, a daughter of Sune Jonsson, justiciar of Tioh√§rad, one of the first margraves of Viipuri. Charles had only one surviving issue, his daughter Margareta Karlsdotter of Tofta (c 1380s - 1429), who was married twice; first to Knut Tordsson Bonde of Penningby and secondly in 1414 to Steen Tureson, lord of Vik and √ñrby. Margaret was the mother of King Charles VIII of Sweden (1408- 1470) and of Birgitta Steensdotter of Vik, heiress of √ñrby and Ekholmen. Her descendants included Regent Steen Sture the Old and Birgitta Gustavsdotter of Revsnes, who became grandmother of Gustav I of Sweden.
