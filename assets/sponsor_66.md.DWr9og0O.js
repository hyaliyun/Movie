Falgui√®re was a member of a National Guard company comprising many artists and intellectuals, among them Felix Philipoteaux.

They are used to represent the Nation through emblems, metaphors, personifications, allegories, which are shared by the entire Italian people. Some of them are official, ie they are recognized by the Italian state authorities, while others are part of the identity of the country without being defined by law.  Description  Allegorical print of 1895 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the capture of Rome. The figure contains numerous national symbols of Italy associated with allegories of ancient Roman historyThe central subject of the print is formed by three female figures with dresses forming the flag of Italy. At the center there is a winged Victory surmounted by the Stella d'Italia and adorned with a collar bearing the Savoy coat of arms. On the left is the Italia turrita, while on the right is the warrior Rome with a Roman helmet holding a spear and a shield with the image of the Capitoline Wolf nursing Romulus and Remus. On the left is the palm of victory, while in the background we can recognize the Altare della Patria, the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius of the Capitoline Hill, the Colosseum, a Triumphal arch, the Trajan's Column, the word SPQR and a winged putto playing the ring of victory. The image is surmounted by a weave of oak and strawberry tree, while below is an aquila with spread wings in a laurel wreath. The three main official symbols, whose typology is present in the symbology of all nations, are: * the flag of Italy, that is, the national flag in green, white and red, as required by article 12 of the Constitution of the Italian Republic;[...] The flag of the Republic is the Italian tricolor: green, white and red, with three vertical bands of equal size. [...] Article No. 12 of the Constitution of the Italian Republic of 27 December 1947, published in the 'Official Journal of the Italian Republic No. 298, Extraordinary Edition, 27 December 1947, and entered into force on 1 January 1948. * the emblem of Italy, that is the iconic symbol identifying the Italian Republic; * The Il Canto degli Italiani by Goffredo Mameli and Michele Novaro, the Italian national anthem, which is performed in all public events. Of these only the flag is explicitly mentioned in the Italian Constitution; this normative insertion puts the flag under the protection of the law, making it possible criminal penalties for contempt of the same. Other official symbols, as reported by the Presidency of the Italian Republic, are: * the Presidential Standard of Italy, that is the distinctive standard representing the Presidency of the Italian Republic; * the Altare della Patria, or the national monument dedicated to King Vittorio Emanuele II of Savoy, the first Sovereign of a united Italy and founder of the Fatherland, which houses the shrine of the Italian tomb of the Unknown Soldier. * the Festa della Repubblica, that is the national celebratory day established to commemorate the birth of the Italian Republic, which is celebrated every year on 2 June, date of the institutional referendum of 1946 with which the monarchy was abolished; The teaching in the schools of the Il Canto degli Italiani, the reflection on the Risorgimento events and on the adoption of the Flag of Italy are prescribed by law n. 222 of 23 November 2012. There are also other symbols or emblems of Italy which, although not defined by law, are part of the Italian identity: * the Italia turrita, that is the national personification of Italy in the appearance of a young woman with her head surrounded by a wall crown completed by towers (hence the term \\"turrita\\"); * the cockade of Italy, or the national ornament of Italy, obtained by folding a green, white and red ribbon into pliss√© using the technique called plissage (\\"pleating\\"); * the national colours of Italy are green, white, and red, collectively known in Italian as il tricolore (the tricolour). In sport in Italy, savoy azure has been used or adopted as the colour for many national teams, the first being the men's football team in 1910. The national auto racing colour of Italy is instead rosso corsa (\\"racing red\\"), while in other disciplines such as cycling and winter sports, which often use white. * the strawberry tree, or the small tree chosen as a national tree because of its green leaves, its white flowers and its red berries, colors that recall the Italian flag; * the Stella d'Italia, the most ancient identity symbol of Italian land, since it dates back to ancient Greece. * the Frecce Tricolori, or the national aerobatic team of the Italian Air Force;  Symbols  =Altare della Patria= Altare della Patria View of the artistic and architectural works present in the Vittoriano The Vittorio Emanuele II Monument () or (Mole del) Vittoriano, improperly called Altare della Patria (English: Altar of the Fatherland), is a monument built in honor of Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a unified Italy, located in Rome, Italy. It occupies a site between the Piazza Venezia and the Capitoline Hill. It is currently managed by the Polo Museale del Lazio, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the Museo Centrale del Risorgimento Italiano. From an architectural point of view it was conceived as a modern forum, an agora on three levels connected by stairways and dominated by a portico characterized by a colonnade. The complex process of national unity and liberation from foreign domination carried out by King Vittorio Emanuele II of Savoy, to whom the monument is dedicated, has a great symbolic and representative value, being architecturally and artistically centered on the Italian unification: for this reason the Vittoriano is considered one of the national symbols of Italy. It also preserves the Altar of the Fatherland (), first an altar of the goddess Rome and then also a shrine of the Italian Unknown Soldier, thus adopting the function of a lay temple consecrated to Italy. Because of its great representative value, the entire Vittoriano is often erroneously called the Altare della Patria, although the latter constitutes only a part of it. Located in the center of ancient Rome and connected to the modern one thanks to streets radiating from Piazza Venezia, it has been consecrated to a wide symbolic value representing - thanks to the call of the figure of Vittorio Emanuele II and the realization of the Altare della Patria - a lay temple metaphorically dedicated to a free and united and celebrating Italy - by virtue of the burial of the Unknown Soldier - the sacrifice for the homeland and for the connected ideals. =Cockade of Italy= Cockade of Italy Gianni Rivera, soccer player of A.C. Milan, with the cockade of Italy, in an image of the early seventies of the 20th century The cockade of Italy () is the national ornament of Italy, obtained by folding a green, white and red ribbon into a pliss√© using the technique called plissage (\\"pleating\\"). It is one of the national symbols of Italy and is composed of the three colors of the Italian flag with the green in the center, the white immediately outside and the red on the edge: this convention on the position of colors derives from the cockades used in Bologna in 1794 during an attempt of revolt, which had this chromatic composition. The cockade with the red and green inverted position is instead that of Iran. The Italian tricolor cockade appeared for the first time in Genoa on 21 August 1789, and with it the colors of the three Italian national colors, anticipating by seven years the first tricolor military banner, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion on 11 October 1796, and of eight years the birth of the flag of Italy, which had its origins on 7 January 1797, when it became for the first time a national flag of an Italian sovereign State, the Cispadane Republic. The hypotheses that consider the birth of the three Italian national colors ascribable to the medieval or Renaissance period, or linked to Freemasonry, are rejected by historians. The green, white and red applied to a tricolor cockade reappeared during the failed uprising of Bologna against the Papal States of 13‚Äì14 November 1794 by Luigi Zamboni and Giovanni Battista De Rolandis. On 14 June 1848 it replaced the azure cockade on the uniforms of some departments of the Royal Sardinian Army (become Royal Italian Army in 1861), while on 1 January 1948, with the birth of the Italian Republic, it took its place as a national ornament. The Italian tricolor cockade is one of the symbols of the Italian Air Force and one of its fabric reproductions is sewn onto the meshes of the sports teams holding the Italian Cups which are organized in various national team sports. =Emblem of Italy= Emblem of Italy The emblem of the Italian Republic () was formally adopted by the newly formed Italian Republic on 5 May 1948. Although often referred to as a coat of arms (or in Italian), it is technically an emblem akin to so-called socialist heraldry as it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules. The emblem comprises a white five-pointed star, the Stella d'Italia, with a thin red border, superimposed upon a five-spoked cogwheel, standing between an olive branch to the left side and an oak branch to the right side; the branches are in turn bound together by a red ribbon with the inscription \\"REPVBBLICA ITALIANA\\" (\\"Italian Republic\\" written in Italian, but in an ancient Roman-style Latin alphabet). The emblem is used extensively by the Italian government. The armorial bearings of the House of Savoy, blazoned gules a cross argent, were previously in use by the former Kingdom of Italy; the supporters, on either side a lion rampant Or, were replaced with fasci littori (literally bundles of the lictors) during the fascist era. =Festa della Repubblica= Former President Giorgio Napolitano reviewing formations deployed for the military magazine during the Festa della Repubblica 2008 Festa della Repubblica (; in English, Republic Day) is the Italian National Day and Republic Day, which is celebrated on 2 June each year, with the main celebration that takes place in Rome. The Festa della Repubblica is one of the national symbols of Italy. The day commemorates the institutional referendum held by universal suffrage in 1946, in which the Italian people were called to the polls to decide on the form of government, following the Second World War and the fall of Fascism The ceremonial of the event organized in Rome includes the deposition of a laurel wreath as a tribute to the Unknown Soldier at the Altare della Patria by the President of the Italian Republic and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome. =Flag of Italy= Flag of Italy The flag of Italy flies from the terraces of the Altare della Patria in Rome The flag of Italy (, ), often referred to in Italian as il Tricolore (); is a tricolour featuring three equally sized vertical pales of green, white and red, with the green at the hoist side. Its current form has been in use since 18 June 1946 and was formally adopted on 1 January 1948.Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana Art. 12, 22 dicembre 1947, pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 298 del 27 dicembre 1947 edizione straordinaria (published in the Official Gazette [of the Italian Republic] No. 298 of 27 December 1947 extraordinary edition) \\"La bandiera della Repubblica √® il tricolore italiano: verde, bianco, e rosso, a tre bande verticali di eguali dimensioni\\" The Tricolour Day, Flag Day dedicated to the Italian flag, is established by law n. 671 of 31 December 1996, which is held every year on 7 January. This celebration commemorates the first official adoption of the tricolor as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, which took place in Reggio Emilia on 7 January 1797. The Italian national colors appeared for the first time in Genoa on a tricolor cockade on 21 August 1789, anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red italian military war flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion on 11 October 1796. Cispadana Republic supplanted Duchy of Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours chosen by the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the recently conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of the uniform of the Milanese civic guard. During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of equal size, clearly inspired by the French model of 1790. After the date of 7 January 1797 the popular consideration for the Italian flag grew steadily, until it became one of the most important symbols of the Risorgimento, which culminated on 17 March 1861 with the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, of which the tricolor rose to national flag. The tricolor flag went through more than two centuries of History of Italy, greeting all the most important events. =Frecce Tricolori= Frecce Tricolori The Frecce Tricolori (; literally \\"Tricolour Arrows\\"), officially known as the 313¬∞ Gruppo Addestramento Acrobatico, Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale (PAN) Frecce Tricolori (\\"313th Acrobatic Training Group, National Aerobatic Team (PAN) Frecce Tricolori\\"), is the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force, based at Rivolto Air Base, province of Udine, in the north-eastern Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, born in 1961 following the decision of the same Air Force and to create a permanent group for the training for the collective air acrobatics of its pilots. They were formed in 1961 as an Air Force team, replacing unofficial teams that had been sponsored by various commands by the beginning of the 1930s.Aeronautica Militare official site The team flies the Aermacchi MB-339-A/PAN, a two-seat fighter-trainer craft capable of 898 km/h at sea level.Caliaro 2005, p. 25 With ten aircraft, nine in training and a soloist, they are the world's largest acrobatics patrol, and their flight schedule, comprising about twenty acrobatics and about half an hour, made them the most famous in the world.Caliaro 2005, p. 25. =Il Canto degli Italiani= Il Canto degli Italiani The vocal recording of the Italian National Anthem ¬´Il Canto degli Italiani¬ª, performed by Coro dell'Accademia Musicale M.o Tufacchi (1943) Il Canto degli Italiani (; DOP entry . \\"The Song of Italians\\") is the national anthem of Italy. It is best known among Italians as the \\"Inno di Mameli\\" (, \\"Mameli's Hymn\\"), after the author of the lyrics, or \\"Fratelli d'Italia\\" (, \\"Brothers of Italy\\"), from its opening line. The words were written in the autumn of 1847 in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli. Two months later, they were set to music in Turin by another Genoese, Michele Novaro. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Italian unification and in the following decades. Nevertheless, after the proclamation of unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the adopted national anthem was the \\"Marcia Reale\\" (Royal March), the official hymn of the House of Savoy composed in 1831 by order of King Charles Albert of Sardinia. After the World War II, Italy became a republic, and on 12 October 1946, \\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\" was provisionally chosen as the country's new national anthem. It was made official on 4 December 2017 de jure. =Italia turrita= Statue of the Italia turrita in Reggio Calabria Italia turrita (; \\"Turreted Italy\\") is the national personification or allegory of Italy, in the appearance of a young woman with her head surrounded by a mural crown completed by towers (hence turrita or \\"with towers\\" in Italian). It is often accompanied by the Stella d'Italia (\\"Star of Italy\\"), from which the so-called Italia turrita e stellata (\\"turreted and stellate Italy\\"), and by other additional attributes, the most common of which is the cornucopia. The allegorical representation with the towers, which draws its origins from ancient Rome, is typical of Italian civic heraldry, so much so that the wall crown is also the symbol of the cities of Italy. Italia turrita, which is one of the national symbols of Italy, has been widely depicted for centuries in the fields of art, politics and literature. Its most classic aspect, which derives from the primordial myth of the Great Mediterranean Mother and which was definitively specified at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries by Cesare Ripa, wants to symbolically convey the royalty and nobility of Italian cities (thanks to the presence of crown turrita), the abundance of agricultural crops of the Italian peninsula (represented by the cornucopia) and the shining destiny of Italy (symbolized by the Stella d'Italia). =National colours of Italy= Italy national football team The national colours of Italy are green, white, and red, collectively known in Italian as il tricolore (the tricolour). The three Italian national colors appeared for the first time in Genoa on August 21, 1789 on the cockade of Italy shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution. In sport in Italy, savoy azure has been used or adopted as the colour for many national teams, the first being the men's football team in 1910. The national auto racing colour of Italy is instead rosso corsa (\\"racing red\\"), while in other disciplines such as cycling and winter sports, white is often used. =Presidential Standard of Italy= Presidential Standard of Italy The Presidential Standard of Italy () is the distinctive standard of the presence of the President of the Italian Republic. Therefore, it follows the Head of State whenever he leaves the Quirinal Palace, where he is exposed during his presence. The standard is displayed on the means of transport on which the president ascends, outside the prefectures when the president is visiting a city and inside the halls where he acts in an official capacity. The presidential standard is one of the National symbols of Italy. The standard recalls the colors of the flag of Italy, with particular reference to the standard of the historic Italian Republic of 1802-1805; the square shape and the savoy blue border, whose use was maintained even in the Republican era, symbolize the Italian Armed Forces, which are commanded by the president. =Stella d'Italia= Stella d'Italia The Stella d'Italia (\\"Star of Italy\\"), popularly known as Stellone d'Italia (\\"Great Star of Italy\\"), is a five- pointed white star symbolizing Italy for many centuries. It is the oldest national symbol of Italy, since it dates back to ancient Greece when Venus, associated with the West as an evening star, was hired to identify the Italian peninsula. From an allegorical point of view, the Stella d'Italia metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy. In the early 16th century it began to be frequently associated with Italia turrita, the national personification of the Italian peninsula. The Stella d'Italia was adopted as part of the emblem of Italy in 1947, where it is superimposed on a steel cogwheel, all surrounded by an oak branch and an olive branch. =Strawberry tree= Strawberry tree The strawberry tree began to be considered one the national symbols of Italy in the 19th century, during the Italian unification, because with its autumn colors it remembers the flag of Italy (green for its leaves, white for its flowers and red for its berries). various authors - Guida pratica agli alberi e arbusti in Italia; Biblioteca per chi ama la natura - Selezione dal Reader's Digest Milano 1983, 1991.

Quirino was the first Mexican journalist killed in 2012. In 2011, ten Mexican journalists were killed, according to the International Press Institute and nine by the count of the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH).  Career and Personal  Ra√∫l R√©gulo Quirino Garza was 30 years old when he was shot and killed 6 January 2012. He lived in Cadereyta Jim√©nez, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Quirino was both a reporter for La √öltima Palabra, which is a weekly newspaper, and worked for the local department of social development. According to his editor, the journalist did not use a byline which would have identified him with his journalistic work. He was active in the Mexican Red Cross.  Death  Raul Regulo Garza Quirino was killed shortly after 5:00 p.m. Friday, January 6, 2012, in Cadereyta Jim√©nez. Garza was driving in his car when he was chased and attacked by armed men in two other cars. Garza attempted to escape but he was shot at 15 times in the city center at a garage owned by a relative. His murder occurred 300 meters from the city hall office. The municipal police have several theories. One theory was the gang was out to steal Garza's new car, a black Volkswagen Jetta, and that it was pursuing the wrong person. Another theory is that it the gang could have been affiliated with Los Zetas drug cartel, which controls the area.~~ Los Zetas are adamant about not being reported and cartel has been implicated in the deaths of many journalists. Some reporters that Los Zetas have killed or attempted to kill are Jaime Orozco, Dolores Guadalupe Garc√≠a Escamilla, and Mar√≠a Elizabeth Mac√≠as Castro.  Context  Cadereyta Jim√©nez, a city in northeast Mexico near Monterey, is home to one of northern Mexico‚Äôs biggest oil refineries and it is controlled by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Over thirty eight oil workers for the state oil company PEMEX have disappeared and the area is known for mass graves. The flow of drugs and contraband are controlled primarily by Los Zetas, a paramilitary group that once worked for the Gulf Cartel before becoming an independent criminal organization. It was in this area that radio journalist Marco Aurelio Mart√≠nez Tijerina was kidnapped and killed in July 2010. According to Reporters Without Borders, eighty journalists have been killed in the past decade and fourteen others have disappeared in Mexico. Most of these killings have gone unpunished. Violence in Mexico is so prevalent that an estimated 48,000 people have been killed, 5,000 are missing, and thousands of children have been orphaned. Much of Mexico seemed to be lowering crime rates with the exception of the north east side of the country. Violence has soared and have almost tripled in Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila during the 2010 and 2011 years. The eastern half is currently consumed in turf wars and causing large amounts of violence. For example, on 13 May 2012, 49 dismembered bodies were found in a mass killing and Los Zetas took responsibility. Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n, who began his term in 2006 and will be ending his term December 2012, focused his presidency on a drug war against the cartels, which is a $39 billion industry. He used military and federal police power and stop money laundering and drug trafficking. A major issue of the 2012 Mexican election was how to stop the cartel violence.  Impact  Shortly after Ra√∫l Quirino was killed, the United States donated $5 million to protect journalists. He was also the last journalist killed before the Mexican Senate acted in March 2012 on a Constitutional Amendment that would include journalists in a class of victims whose murder would trigger a federal investigation and criminal status, which journalism and press freedom organizations have advocated to tackle the problem of impunity.  Reactions  Oscar Gonz√°lez, who is president of a local press association in Nuevo Leon, demanded authorities investigate the murder completely, examine all motives and bring the murderers to justice. The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) also called for an investigation. The PEN American Center initiated a letter addressed to President Calder√≥n on behalf of its members which stated: (The organization) \\"is seriously concerned that the recent murder of Ra√∫l R√©gulo Garza Quirino indicates an ongoing intolerance of journalists and a worsening climate of impunity in Mexico. We therefore call for a full investigation into the murder, and reiterate our call on President Felipe Calder√≥n to fulfill promises to make crimes against journalists a federal offense by amending the Constitution so that federal authorities have the power to investigate, prosecute, and punish such crimes, and to immediately implement the journalist protection mechanisms it promised in November 2010.is seriously concerned that the recent murder of Ra√∫l R√©gulo Garza Quirino indicates an ongoing intolerance of journalists and a worsening climate of impunity in Mexico.

It was founded in 1862 as a male choir and was a mixed choir from 1887. From 1981 to 2018, it was conducted by Gabriel Dessauer, who founded two children's choirs. The group sang the first performance in Germany of John Rutter's Mass of the Children and performed in Azkoitia, San Sebasti√°n, G√∂rlitz, Bruges, Macon and Rome. Colin Mawby composed for the choir the Missa solemnis Bonifatius-Messe for the 150th anniversary, celebrated on 3 October 2012. From 2019, the choir has been conducted by Roman Twardy who conducted in his first concert Dvo≈ô√°k's Stabat Mater.  History  = 1862 to 1981 = St. Bonifatius, the main Catholic church of Wiesbaden, the capital of Hesse, was consecrated in 1849. In 1862 a men's choir, intended to be a model for the singing of the congregation, was founded by teacher Johann Schickel (1862‚Äì1876). From 1876, the choir was conducted by Heinrich Link, but he resigned when boys were permitted to join. From 1887 the high parts were sung by boys, and from 1899 they were sung by female singers. The program for the 50th anniversary lists the oratorio Die heilige Elisabeth by August Wiltberger. From 1919 to 1929, the director was Franz Xaver Schmitz. For the 60th anniversary, the choir performed the Missa \\"Mater admirabilis\\" by Peter Griesbacher in the service. From 1929 to 1952, Hermann Massenkeil conducted the choir. However, he was conscripted in the military during World War II, and his predecessor Schmitz returned. Massenkeil took detailed notes about the choir's history, mentioning for example that on 19 November 1933 the oratorio Die heilige Elisabeth by Joseph Haas was performed. On 16 January 1938, a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the church choir, it presented a cappella works in the Pontifical High Mass, and in a vespers service works from the \\"kirchenmusikalisches Schaffen zeitgen√∂ssischer Komponisten der K√∂lner, M√ºnchener, Berliner und Wiener Schule\\" (sacred works by contemporary composers of the Munich, Berlin and Vienna school), for example Hans Lang's Laudate Domino and Franz Philipp's Tantum Ergo. The organ balcony was severely damaged by an air raid in World War II. The choir had to sing from the altar area until 1949. During the \\"Festwoche zum 100j√§hrigen Kirchjubil√§um\\" (Festive week for centenary of the church) in 1962, the choir performed Palestrina's Mass \\"O admirabile commercium\\" and Bruckner's Locus iste. In a \\"Kirchenmusikalische Feierstunde zur Wiederherstellung der Bonifatiuskirche\\" (Festive hour of church music for the restoration of the church) on 7 May 1950, they sang the third part of the oratorio Das Lebensbuch Gottes by Haas and a cantata for St. Mary by Carl Thiel. The chronicle for the centenary summarises: \\"Die seit 1929 verzeichneten k√ºnstlerischen Ereignisse geben nun ein so √ºberw√§ltigendes Zeugnis lebendigster Anteilnahme des Chores und seiner F√ºhrung an den allgemeinreligi√∂sen, liturgischen, kirchenmusikalischen und allgemeinkulturellen Belangen dieser Zeit ...\\" (\\"The artistic events recorded since 1929 stand now as a magnificent testimony to the very lively part played by the choir and its leadership in the general religious, liturgical, and church-music life and in the common cultural landscape of this period.\\"). From 1952, G√ºnther Nierle was the director. Nierle had been organist at the Breslau Cathedral from 1935. He performed, among others, Hans Leo Hassler's Missa super Dixit Maria, Handel's Dettingen Te Deum and Mozart's Kr√∂nungsmesse. From 1963 to 1980, Peter Kempin was the cantor. He performed works by Monteverdi, Pergolesi, Sch√ºtz, Bach, Cherubini, Mendelsohn, Bruckner and Hindemith, partly for the first time in the city. The choir sang the premiere of the Mass Deutsche Messe mit Einheitsliedern for mixed choir, six brass players and congregational singing (1965) by Friedrich Zehm on 15 September 1968 in a festive service for the diocese, the Limburger Kreuzwoche (Limburg week of the Cross), with members of the Hessisches Staatsorchester. Kempin conducted the premiere of the Requiem by Christoph Straus (17th century), for soloists, choir and orchestra. = 1981 to 2018 = From 1981, Gabriel Dessauer conducted the choir.

The MERCI Retriever is a medical device designed to treat Ischemic Strokes. The name is an acronym for Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia. Designed by University of California, Los Angeles in 2001, MERCI was the first device approved in the U.S. to remove blood clots in patients suffering from acute brain ischemia. Medical uses It may result in benefit in certain people as long as 8 hours after the ischemic event. In this carefully selected group it achieved 48% vessel re-canalization and lower mortality rates than the use of r-tPA in revascularized patients. Mechanism In an ischemic stroke, there is an obstruction within blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. The goal in treatment of such a stroke is to restore blood flow through these blood vessels. The MERCI retriever does so by allowing the removal of the blood clots causing the obstruction. The retriever consists of a long thin wire with a helical coil formed at the distal end. A balloon catheter is snaked into the affected vessel from the femoral artery, and the balloon is inflated to prevent blood flow that could hinder the retrieval process. The retriever is then fed through the catheter, during which the distal coil is straightened to fit through the catheter tube. When the retriever emerges at the clot site, the coil reforms, wrapping around the clot and allowing the clot to be removed with the catheter. History The MERCI Retriever obtained U.S. FDA clearance in August 2004 for re- canalization of cerebral arteries in acute stroke. =FDA Process= Concentric Medical undertook a preliminary study of the MERCI retriever to assess its effectiveness.

It consists of a central coronene molecule, with an additional benzene ring fused between each adjacent pair of rings around the periphery. It is sometimes simply called hexabenzocoronene, however, there are other chemicals that share this less-specific name, such as hexa-cata- hexabenzocoronene. Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene has been imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) providing the first example of a molecule in which differences in bond order and bond lengths of the individual bonds can be distinguished by a measurement in direct space.  Supramolecular structures  Various hexabenzocoronenes have been investigated in supramolecular electronics. They are known to self-assemble into a columnar phase. One derivative in particular forms carbon nanotubes with interesting electrical properties. The columnar phase in this compound further organises itself into sheets, which ultimately roll up like a carpet to form multi-walled nanotubes with an outer diameter of 20 nanometers and a wall thickness of 3 nm. In this geometry, the stacks of coronene disks are aligned with the length of the tube. The nanotubes have sufficient length to fit between two platinum nanogap electrodes produced by scanning probe nanofabrication and are 180 nm apart. The nanotubes as such are insulating, but, after one-electron oxidation with nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (), they conduct electricity. = Synthesis = Organic synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene starts with an Aldol condensation reaction of dibenzyl ketone with a benzil derivative to give a substituted cyclopentadienone. A Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction with alkyne and subsequent expulsion of carbon monoxide gives a hexaphenylbenzene.

In relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the Bargmann‚ÄìWigner equations describe free particles of arbitrary spin , an integer for bosons () or half-integer for fermions (). The solutions to the equations are wavefunctions, mathematically in the form of multi-component spinor fields. They are named after Valentine Bargmann and Eugene Wigner. History Paul Dirac first published the Dirac equation in 1928, and later (1936) extended it to particles of any half-integer spin before Fierz and Pauli subsequently found the same equations in 1939, and about a decade before Bargman, and Wigner. Eugene Wigner wrote a paper in 1937 about unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group, or the Poincar√© group. Wigner notes Ettore Majorana and Dirac used infinitesimal operators applied to functions. Wigner classifies representations as irreducible, factorial, and unitary. In 1948 Valentine Bargmann and Wigner published the equations now named after them in a paper on a group theoretical discussion of relativistic wave equations. Statement of the equations For a free particle of spin without electric charge, the BW equations are a set of coupled linear partial differential equations, each with a similar mathematical form to the Dirac equation. The full set of equations are :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\left (-\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu + mc \\\\right )_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha_1'}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha'_1 \\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_{2j}} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left (-\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu + mc \\\\right )_{\\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_2'}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha'_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_{2j}} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left (-\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu + mc \\\\right )_{\\\\alpha_{2j} \\\\alpha'_{2j}}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha'_{2j}} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} which follow the pattern; }} for . (Some authors e.g. Loide and Saar use to remove factors of 2. Also the spin quantum number is usually denoted by in quantum mechanics, however in this context is more typical in the literature). The entire wavefunction has components : \\\\psi_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_{2j}} (\\\\mathbf{r},t) and is a rank-2j 4-component spinor field. Each index takes the values 1, 2, 3, or 4, so there are components of the entire spinor field , although a completely symmetric wavefunction reduces the number of independent components to . Further, are the gamma matrices, and :\\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu = i\\\\hbar \\\\partial_\\\\mu is the 4-momentum operator. The operator constituting each equation, , is a matrix, because of the matrices, and the term scalar-multiplies the identity matrix (usually not written for simplicity). Explicitly, in the Dirac representation of the gamma matrices: :\\\\begin{align} -\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\hat{P}_\\\\mu + mc & = -\\\\gamma^0 \\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c} - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}\\\\cdot(-\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}) + mc \\\\\\\\\\\\ [6pt] & = -\\\\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -I_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c} \\\\+ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} + \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & I_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}mc \\\\\\\\\\\\ [8pt] & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c}+mc & 0 & \\\\hat{p}_z & \\\\hat{p}_x - i\\\\hat{p}_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -\\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c}+mc & \\\\hat{p}_x + i\\\\hat{p}_y & -\\\\hat{p}_z \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\hat{p}_z & -(\\\\hat{p}_x - i\\\\hat{p}_y) & \\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c}+mc & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -(\\\\hat{p}_x + i\\\\hat{p}_y) & \\\\hat{p}_z & 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\hat{E}}{c}+mc \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where is a vector of the Pauli matrices, E is the energy operator, is the 3-momentum operator, denotes the identity matrix, the zeros (in the second line) are actually blocks of zero matrices. The above matrix operator contracts with one bispinor index of at a time (see matrix multiplication), so some properties of the Dirac equation also apply to the BW equations: *the equations are Lorentz covariant, *all components of the solutions also satisfy the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation, and hence fulfill the relativistic energy‚Äìmomentum relation, ::E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 *second quantization is still possible. Unlike the Dirac equation, which can incorporate the electromagnetic field via minimal coupling, the B‚ÄìW formalism comprises intrinsic contradictions and difficulties when the electromagnetic field interaction is incorporated. In other words, it is not possible to make the change , where is the electric charge of the particle and is the electromagnetic four-potential. An indirect approach to investigate electromagnetic influences of the particle is to derive the electromagnetic four-currents currents and multipole moments for the particle, rather than include the interactions in the wave equations themselves. Lorentz group structure The representation of the Lorentz group for the BW equations is :D^\\\\mathrm{BW} = \\\\bigotimes_{r=1}^{2j} \\\\left[ D_r^{(1/2,0)}\\\\oplus D_r^{(0,1/2)}\\\\right]\\\\,. where each is an irreducible representation. This representation does not have definite spin unless equals 1/2 or 0. One may perform a Clebsch‚ÄìGordan decomposition to find the irreducible terms and hence the spin content. This redundancy necessitates that a particle of definite spin that transforms under the representation satisfies field equations. The representations and can each separately represent particles of spin . A state or quantum field in such a representation would satisfy no field equation except the Klein-Gordon equation. Formulation in curved spacetime Following M. Kenmoku, in local Minkowski space, the gamma matrices satisfy the anticommutation relations: :[\\\\gamma^i,\\\\gamma^j]_{+} = 2\\\\eta^{ij}I_4 where is the Minkowski metric. For the Latin indices here, . In curved spacetime they are similar: :[\\\\gamma^\\\\mu,\\\\gamma^ u]_{+} = 2g^{\\\\mu u} where the spatial gamma matrices are contracted with the vierbein to obtain , and is the metric tensor. For the Greek indices; . A covariant derivative for spinors is given by :\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu=\\\\partial_\\\\mu+\\\\Omega_\\\\mu with the connection given in terms of the spin connection by: :\\\\Omega_\\\\mu =\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\omega^{ij} (\\\\gamma_i\\\\gamma_j-\\\\gamma_j\\\\gamma_i) The covariant derivative transforms like : :\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu\\\\psi \\\\rightarrow D(\\\\Lambda) \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu \\\\psi With this setup, equation () becomes: :\\\\begin{align} & (-i\\\\hbar\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu + mc)_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha_1'}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha'_1 \\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_{2j}} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & (-i\\\\hbar\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu + mc)_{\\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_2'}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha'_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_{2j}} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & (-i\\\\hbar\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu + mc)_{\\\\alpha_{2j} \\\\alpha'_{2j}}\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha_1 \\\\alpha_2 \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha'_{2j}} = 0 \\\\,.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} See also *Two-body Dirac equation *Generalizations of Pauli matrices *Wigner D-matrix *Weyl‚ÄìBrauer matrices *Higher-dimensional gamma matrices *Joos‚ÄìWeinberg equation, alternative equations which describe free particles of any spin References =Notes= =Further reading= Books Selected papers    External links Relativistic wave equations: *Dirac matrices in higher dimensions, Wolfram Demonstrations Project *Learning about spin-1 fields, P.

It carries both the North Wales Coast Line for trains, which runs from Crewe to Holyhead and the A5 road between London and Holyhead. The embankment was designed by, and its construction overseen by, Thomas Telford and was named after the Stanley family who were significant benefactors to the area.Hughes, Margaret: \\"Anglesey from the sea\\", page 73. Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2001 Prior to its construction the fastest route to Holyhead from the island's mainland was via the old stone bridge at Four Mile Bridge (). When the A5 road was being constructed between London and the Port of Holyhead a more direct route was needed. Construction started in 1822 and completed a year later and is a total of long.Jones, G: \\"Anglesey Railways\\", page 17. Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2005 It is significantly wider at the base (35 metres) than at the top (10 metres). The embankment to Holy Island was constructed using rock and materials excavated from a site on the Anglesey side. A workers‚Äô hamlet grew up around the artificially-created depression, which was nicknamed ‚Äúthe valley‚Äù.Hughes, Margaret: \\"Anglesey Villages\\", page 71. Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2003 After work ended, the settlement remained developing into a medium-sized village known as Valley. A year after opening, the embankment was partly damaged in a storm in 1824. In the 1840s, the embankment was chosen to carry the North Wales Coast Line to the Port of Holyhead (rather than build an entirely new crossing). Work to significantly widen the structure was completed in 1848. To allay concerns that passing trains might startle horse drawn traffic using the embankment, a tall stone dividing wall was built between the road and the railway. The embankment remained the only major crossing between Holy Island and Anglesey for more than 175 years. In 2001 it was superseded by a new wider embankment, which was built as part of the final section of the A55 North Wales Expressway. The section completely bypassed Valley and the old A5 at this point. The new crossing, which carries the modern A55 dual carriageway, was built parallel to the Stanley Embankment, following its north-south alignment.

The book was published as a paperback original by Harper Perennial on July 31, 2012. The graphic novel adapts Sun Tzu's original The Art of War into a science fiction story that follows an ex-soldier who works in a militarized financial world dominated by the Chinese government. Publication history Author Kelly Roman was inspired to adapt The Art of War after \\"he sensed a growing national anxiety about China's hegemonic rise, and I wanted to transform the ancient text into something that explored this anxiety.\\" He references the formation of China's first sovereign foreign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, in 2007 and the fund's subsequent $3 billion investment in the American private equity firm Blackstone as key events in The Art of Wars genesis. Synopsis The protagonist, Kelly Roman, served time in military prison for accidentally maiming the woman in his battalion that he was in love with. After being freed, Roman discovers his hometown in shambles and learns from his father that his brother Shane died while working for a company called Trench. Kelly travels to New York City to investigate and gets a job at Trench working for Shane's old boss, the brilliant and ruthless Sun Tzu, who manages China's investments around the world. The United States invests all that remains of Medicare and Social Security with Trench in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy, and Sun Tzu uses Roman to help compete with a company called Vespoid that manages the investments of India and the Vatican Bank. A battle over a highly valuable and dangerous new technology ensues: a start up company called Controlled Black Hole Technologies has pioneered the use of industrial black holes. Vespoid and Trench augment their heavily armed investment bankers with myriad forms of drone technology and biotechnology to acquire the coveted black hole tech. All the while, Roman keeps an illustrated diary in which he writes down all of Sun Tzu's teachings (The Art of War). Roman rises through the ranks of Trench and ultimately wins the opportunity to avenge his brother, redeem himself for disfiguring the woman he loves, and save the United States from bankruptcy‚Äîbut at tremendous personal cost. Chinatown blood event In May 2011, Kelly Roman and Michael Deweese staged a publicity stunt in New York's Chinatown during which they had their blood extracted in public and stamped on the covers of chapter samples which they handed out for free to comic book fans. Art exhibition Beginning on July 31, 2012, White Box, an art gallery in New York City, launched a week-long exhibition of all the original artwork for The Art of War‚Äîover 230 pieces. The event was sponsored by Societe Perrier. Women's Wear Daily reported on vandalism that occurred at White Box on the night of the opening. White Box Artistic Director Juan Puntes told WWD that he had not seen similar violence after an opening since the 1970s and attributed it to the politically charged nature of the graphic novel and its images. Reception Reviews of The Art of War have been mostly positive. Critics praised it for its strong characters, visual intensity and experimentation, and social commentary on the modern financial industry and China-US relations, while others criticized it for being too dark and violent. Prominent reviewers drew comparisons to Philip K. Dick, William Gibson and Jean-Luc Godard. The San Francisco Chronicle described the book as \\"a melodrama of chiaroscuro, with red surging onto Michael DeWeese's virtuosic twist on the heavy metal palette when blood is shed ... the novel has the feel of a ballet or an opera.\\" The Austin Chronicle urged readers to \\"imagine the sort of thing William Gibson, on steroids, might write if he'd been bitten by a radioactive E. O. Wilson\\". Kirkus Reviews called it \\"an epic dystopian story of brotherly love and corporate greed\\".

From 1895‚Äì1898 he was a member of the London County Council, representing Rotherhithe as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. In 1897 the sitting member of parliament for Deptford, Charles Darling, was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. This required him to vacate his seat, and Morton was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the ensuing by-election. Morton was elected and held the seat until 1906. In 1904 he was appointed an ecclesiastical commissioner. In 1903 Morton married Evelyn Wilson-Todd, daughter of Sir William Wilson-Todd of Halnaby Hall, and Tranby Park, Yorkshire, MP for Howdenshire.

In his lifetime he made major contributions to many areas of the field including dislocation behaviour of ceramics, disclination behaviour of polymers, and production of metal glasses.  Life  John J. Gilman was born as John Joseph Gilman on December 25, 1925 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1946, he received both his Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering and his Master of Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1952, Gilman received Ph.D. in physical metallurgy from Columbia University. In 1952, he briefly worked at the Crucible Steel Company of America as a steel researcher and subsequently worked at the General Electric Research Laboratory that same year. While working at the General Electric laboratory, he expanded his studies in mechanical properties and the structure of single crystals. After leaving General Electric in 1960, Gilman became a professor of engineering at Brown University. He moved to University of Illinois as a professor of physics and metallurgy in 1963. In 1968, he became director of the Materials Research Center at Allied Chemical. At Allied, he worked on metallic glasses. In 1978, he became director of the Corporate Development Center. In 1980, he became a research manager at Standard Oil. In 1981, he became a director of Amoco Battery Technology.

Gilman was editor and co-editor of three books and author of four. His work also resulted in him acquiring several patents including one for rhenium boride compounds to be used as abrasives, cutting tools and as protective coatings. Gilman is known for his contributions to the field of material science (dislocations in ceramics, disclinations in polymers, and new metal glasses). Gilman designed a tetrahedral truss different from Buckminster Fuller's famous 1953 truss in 1981. Gilman attributed the strength of his tetrahedral truss to \\"the inherent rigidity of the skeletal triangle\\"John J.

History The history of the building remotes to the reign of King Sebastian, owned by Manuel Barreto Quaresma, who had a house on the lands, a time when there were many recreational estates in Lisbon. The Palace was constructed in the second-half of the 18th century by its first property-owner, D. Luis de Meneses, Master of Pancas and Ponte da Barca, holder of the title of Commander of Santos-o-Novo. By June 1815, the descendants of the Meneses family had put the property and gardens up for sale, which was unsuccessful, and it was eventually placed on sale again in 1816. By 1820, the building was once again for sale, this time by the Palha family, who were residents of the zone. In 1968, the palace was acquired by the municipal council of Lisbon, in order to demolish and extend the width of Rua de Santa Apol√≥nia, but it is likely that some problem arose during the transaction. By 1983, the building was still associated with the Van Zeller family descendants. On February 1981 and September, the Ministry of Culture issued a dispatch, classifying the building as a Property of Public Interest. Yet, it was only in 1990, that projects were initiated, using European Union funds to restore the property. This recuperation began in 1992, under the design of architect Frederico George (1915-1994). But, the architect died in February 1994, leave some details to resolve, resulting in Quirino da Fonseca intervening in the reconstruction. In 2009, the project was reformulated as a Hotel de Charme, but was cancelled by the Comiss√£o Municipal de Habita√ß√£o (Municipal Commission of Habita√ß√£o), who intended to use the space for public housing. On 14 February 2010, a dispatch fixed the building within a Zona Especial de Prote√ß√£o (Special Protection Zone), that included the Barbadinhos Elevator (1176/2010, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie-2, 248). But, on 18 October 2010, the building was placed on sale, to be transformed into a hotel. Architecture The palatial residence is located in an urban setting, at the junction of intersection Rua de Santa Apol√≥nia and Travessa do Recolhimento de L√°zaro Leit√£o. To the northwest is the ample walled gardens that integrates into the area of Santa Apol√≥nia, whose urban area is still marked by rural and urban elements, and includes several exceptional architectural objects, including: the Monastery of Santos-o-Novo, the residence of Pal√°cio Van-Zeller, in addition to other palatial homes, such as the Veloso Palace, and Palace of the Count Bar√£o de Alvito and Palace of Coimbra. The building consists of an \\"L\\"-shaped body, a complex volume of several stories, with two facades. The eastern frontage, along Rua de Santa Apol√≥nia, is a large, extensive two-story frontage with pillars, rectangular doors and windows on the first registry and a second story separated by limestone frieze, also with rectangular windows and iron grading. This facade is decorated with cornices supported by a simple edge. The smaller northeastern facade, along Travessa do Recolhimento de L√°zaro Leit√£o, is separated from the anterior by stone corners, and includes two story facade, marked by three veins with an attic louver window. The central vain is the largest, with framed doorway decorated in limestone, providing access to a truncated elliptical interior atrium, connected by staircase to an oval hall, to a master staircase and the noble hall. This space occupies the eastern wing of the palace, a rectangular hall with two wings on the extreme western facade, that overlooks the gardens over five glass arches. Along the corner of the noble hall, is a stone coat-of-arms for the Pereiras, Farias and Almeidas (known as the Palha family).

The Thrissil and the Rois is a Scots poem composed by William Dunbar to mark the wedding, in August 1503, of King James IV of Scotland to Princess Margaret Tudor of England. The poem takes the form of a dream vision in which Margaret is represented by a rose and James is represented variously by a lion, an eagle and a thistle.W. Mackay Mackenzie, The Poems of William Dunbar. The Mercat Press, 1990, pp. 107-112 The episodes of the poem present in allegory King James' view of himself and of his kingdom. Princess Margaret receives lavish praise for her beauty, virtue and high birth.The full text with notes at TEAMS The text of the poem is found only in the Bannatyne Manuscript. It is also known as The Thistle and the Rose. Historical Context The marriage of James IV, King of Scots, and Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII of England had been agreed in the Treaty of Perpetual Peace of 1502.Jane E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-formed, The New Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 6. Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp.58,59. This treaty was intended to effect a reconciliation between the kingdoms of Scotland and England which had been at war intermittently since 1296. The treaty would not be successful in establishing peace.Norman Macdougall, The Stewart Dynasty in Scotland, James IV. Tuckwell press, 1997, pp. 247-281 Ten years after the marriage of James and Margaret Scotland and England aligned themselves with opposing alliances in the War of the League of Cambrai. The subsequent campaign ended with James' death in the Scots' defeat at Flodden.Jane E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-formed, The New Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 6. Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp.82-84. The author, William Dunbar, was a prolific poet who had been employed at the Scots royal court since at least 1500.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.3 (1901), see index, p.470 His work often recorded state events. The thistle had first appeared in Scottish iconography on the coins of King James III. His son and successor James IV continued its use as a symbol of the Scottish monarchy. A rose, coloured red and white, had been adopted as a dynastic symbol by Henry VII who had seized the throne of England in 1485. It represented a union of the Lancastrian and Yorkist factions of the Plantagenet dynasty which had fought a series of civil wars for the control of the English throne before being succeeded by Henry. A red rose was a badge of the Lancastrians; A white rose was a badge of the Yorkists. The Poem Princess Margaret of England sketched by an unknown artist. \\"Recueil d'Arras\\", sixteenth century.The Thrissil and the Rois is composed in rhyme royal stanzas and makes free use of aureate vocabulary inspired by Latin and French. The narrative is presented in the common medieval device of a dream vision. =The Introduction= Dunbar begins with a description of Spring. :Quhen Merche wes with variand windis past, :And Appryll had with hir silver schouris :Tane leif at Nature with ane orient blast, :And lusty May, that muddir is of flouris, :Had maid the birdis to begyn thair houris, :Amang the tendir odouris reid and quhyt, :Quhois armony to heir it wes delyt, The sleeping poet has a dream in which he is visited by the personification of May. :Me thocht fresche May befoir my bed upstude :In weid depaynt of mony divers hew, :Sobir, benyng, and full of mansuetude, :In brycht atteir of flouris forgit new, :Hevinly of color, quhyt, reid, broun, and blew, :Balmit in dew and gilt with Phebus bemys :Quhill all the hous illumynit of hir lemys. She demands that he rises and compose a poem in her honour. :\\"Slugird,\\" scho said, \\"Awalk annone, for schame, :And in my honour sumthing thow go wryt, The poet complains that he can't meet her request. He claims to have had no inspiration recently. :Quhairto quod I, Sall I uprys at morrow, :For in this May few birdis herd I sing? :Thai haif moir caus to weip and plane thair sorrow, :Thy air it is nocht holsum nor benyng, Patiently, May reminds him that he had previously promised her to write a poem about 'the most pleasant rose'. :With that this lady sobirly did smyll :And said, Uprys and do thy observance, :Thow did promyt in Mayis lusty quhyle :For to discryve the ros of most plesance. May then departs into a beautiful garden and, dressed hurriedly, the poet follows her. :Quhen this wes said depairtit scho, this quene, :And enterit in a lusty gairding gent. :And than, me thocht, sa listely besene, :In serk and mantill, full haistely I went, :Into this garth, most dulce and redolent, :Of herb and flour and tendir plantis sueit, :And grene levis doing of dew doun fleit. =Dame Nature= In the garden Dame Nature is holding court attended by other mythological characters. :The birdis did with oppin vocis cry, :O luvaris fo, away thow dully nycht, :And welcum day that confortis every wicht. :Haill May, haill Flora, haill Aurora schene, :Haill princes Natur, haill Venus luvis quene. Dame Nature sends messengers to assemble all the animals, birds and plants of the world. :Scho ordand eik that every bird and beist, :Befoir hir hienes suld annone compeir, :And every flour of vertew, most and leist, :And every herb be feild, fer and neir, The assembly gathers quickly. :All present wer in twynkling of ane e, :Baith beist and bird and flour, befoir the quene. =The Lion= Dame Nature calls the Lion forward. He is described as resembling the Lion Rampant standard of the Scots Kings. :Reid of his cullour as is the ruby glance, :On feild of gold he stude full mychtely, :With flour delycis sirculit lustely. Dame Nature crowns the lion as King of the animals and instructs him to exercise justice wisely. :This lady liftit up his cluvis cleir, :And leit him listly lene upone hir kne, :And crownit him with dyademe full deir, :Of radyous stonis most ryall for to se, :Saying, The king of beistis mak I thee, :And the chief protector in the woddis and schawis. :Onto thi leigis go furth, and keip the lawis. :Exerce justice with mercy and conscience, :And lat no small beist suffir skaith na skornis :Of greit beistis that bene of moir piscence. The lion seems to symbolise the duty of the King of Scots to bring justice to his subjects both humble and powerful. The animals acclaim their new King. :All kynd of beistis into thair degr√© :At onis cryit lawd, Vive le roy! :And till his feit fell with humilit√©, :And all thay maid him homege and fewt√©, =The Eagle= Dame Nature then crowns the Eagle as King of the birds and sharpens his feathers 'like steel darts'. He is commanded to let 'no ravening bird cause trouble'. :Syne crownit scho the Egle, king of fowlis, :And as steill dertis scherpit scho his pennis, :And bawd him be als just to awppis and owlis :As unto pacokkis, papingais, or crennis, :And mak a law for wycht fowlis and for wrennis, :And lat no fowll of ravyne do efferay, :Nor devoir birdis bot his awin pray. The Eagle appears to symbolise the King's determination to keep the peace within Scotland and, perhaps, to keep the peace with England. =The Thistle= Dame Nature then inspects the plants and judges the spiked thistle to be 'able for war'. The thistle is crowned King of the plants with a 'radiant crown of rubys'. :Upone the awfull Thrissill scho beheld :And saw him kepit with a busche of speiris. :Concedring him so able for the weiris, :A radius croun of rubeis scho him gaif. The thistle is commanded to 'go into the field and defend the others.' :And said, In feild go furth and fend the laif. The thistle seems to represent the King's determination to defend his Kingdom. Dame Nature then advises the Thistle to show discretion when judging other plants. :And sen thow art a king, thow be discreit, :Herb without vertew hald nocht of sic pryce :As herb of vertew and of odor sueit, :And lat no nettill vyle and full of vyce :Hir fallow to the gudly flour delyce, :Nor latt no wyld weid full of churlichenes :Compair hir till the lilleis nobilnes, This passage appears to be a diplomatically-worded appeal to the King to abandon his mistresses after his marriage. Nature recommends the red-and-white rose to him above all other flowers. :Nor hald non udir flour in sic denty :As the fresche Ros of cullour reid and quhyt, :For gife thow dois, hurt is thyne honesty, :Conciddering that no flour is so perfyt, :So full of vertew, plesans, and delyt, :So full of blisfull angelik bewty, :Imperiall birth, honour, and dignit√©. The rose clearly represents Margaret of England. =The Rose= Dame Nature then addresses the rose and, after praising her lavishly, asks her to approach and be crowned. :Than to the Ros scho turnyt hir visage :And said, O lusty dochtir most benyng, :Aboif the lilly illustare of lynnage, :Fro the stok ryell rysing fresche and ying, :But ony spot or macull doing spring, :Cum, blowme of joy, with jemis to be cround, :For our the laif thy bewty is renownd. :A coistly croun with clarefeid stonis brycht, :This cumly quene did on hir heid inclois, The new Queen is acclaimed. :Quhairfoir me thocht all flouris did rejos, :Crying attonis, Haill be thow richest Ros, :Haill hairbis empryce, haill freschest quene of flouris! :To thee be glory and honour at all houris! The birds join the acclamation of the new Queen who is compared to a pearl. The name 'Margaret' is derived from the Latin term for a pearl, 'margarita'. :The commoun voce uprais of birdis small :Apone this wys, O blissit be the hour, :That thow wes chosin to be our principall, :Welcome to be our princes of honour, :Our perle, our plesans, and our paramour, :Our peax, our play, our plane felicit√©: :Chryst thee conserf frome all adversit√©! The birds' song merges with the dawn chorus which then wakes Dunbar. He looks around for the garden he saw in his dream but finds it gone. While 'half- frightened', he starts to write the poem. :Than all the birdis song with sic a schout, :That I annone awoilk quhair that I lay, :And with a braid I turnyt me about, :To se this court, bot all wer went away. :Than up I lenyt, halflingis in affrey, :And thus I wret, as ye haif hard to forrow, :Of lusty May upone the nynt morrow. It is the ninth of May.

Cowan played for the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts. Cowan was a standout track and football athlete at his Fort Wayne, Indiana high school. He attended Indiana University and starred as a halfback for two years, interrupted by service in the Army Air Force during World War II. Cowan joined the Browns in 1947, when the team won the AAFC championship. Cleveland won all of its games in 1948 and beat the Buffalo Bills in the championship game. Cowan was sent to the Colts for the 1949 season, but he was slowed by a knee injury and left the game a year later. He became a high school principal in Fort Wayne after his playing career. High school and college career Cowan grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana and was a star athlete at the city's North Side High School. He failed to place first just once in the 220-yard dash during his high school track career. Cowan came in second in his only loss at a state track meet in his sophomore year. He had times of 9.9 seconds in the 100-yard dash, under 22 seconds in the 220 and 49 seconds in the 440. Cowan's football team lost only twice in four years at North Side. The team went unbeaten in his senior year, and Cowan broke a state high school scoring record with 155 points playing as a right halfback. Cowan attended Indiana University starting in 1941. He became the football team's starting right halfback in the middle of the following year, his sophomore season. Cowan also played basketball at Indiana, and was spotted during a state tournament in 1941 by Blanton Collier, who went on to become an assistant coach for the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Cowan joined the Army Air Force in 1943 and served in World War II as part of the ground crew at various military bases and at Okinawa. He played in 1944 for the service basketball team at a Salt Lake City, Utah base called the Air Base Wings. After the war, he returned to Indiana and played part of the 1946 season at right halfback. His best game for Indiana came against the Rose Bowl champion Illinois, when he caught a pass for a 37-yard touchdown and helped set up a second touchdown with a run as the Hoosiers won by seven points. Professional career Cowan was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the 1945 NFL Draft. The war delayed his professional career, however, and he signed in 1947 with the Browns, who selected him in the 1947 AAFC Draft. Cowan won a spot on the roster alongside fellow Fort Wayne native and Indiana graduate Bill Boedeker. The Browns finished the season with a 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and won the AAFC championship game against the New York Yankees. After the season, he returned to Indiana to finish his final semester and get a degree. Cowan returned to the Browns in 1948. The team won all of its games that year, beating the Buffalo Bills in the championship game. Cowan, however, lost his job as the starting right halfback late in the season to Dub Jones. He was sent to the Baltimore Colts before the 1949 season. Bothered by a knee injury, Cowan left football after a year in Baltimore.

Those houses are art studios for art related to African-American themes. A row behind the art studio houses single mothers.  History  Rick Lowe, a native of Alabama and 2014 MacArthur \\"genius\\" grant winner, founded Project Row Houses in 1993 with James Bettison, Bert Long, Jr., Jesse Lott, Floyd Newsum, Bert Samples, and George Smith. In 1990, according to Lowe, a group of high school students approached Lowe and asked him to create solutions to problems instead of creating works that tell the community about issues it is already aware of. Lowe and a coalition of artists purchased a group of 22 shotgun houses across two blocks that were built in 1930 and, by the 1990s, were in poor condition. Lisa Gray of the Houston Chronicle said that the houses, originally used as rentals, were \\"previously ruled by drugs and prostitutes.\\" Inspired by the work of John T. Biggers, the group used seed money funds from the Elizabeth Firestone Graham Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts to restore the houses. Corporate sponsor Chevron renovated the outside of several shotgun houses. The director of the Menil Foundation allowed Monday to be a day off of work for the employees so that they could help renovate the shotgun houses. Volunteers numbering in the hundreds fortified porches, removed trash and used needles from lots, and hung wallboard. Several individuals and families from the area and one local church \\"adopted\\" individual houses. Garnet Coleman adopted one house. The houses first opened in 1994. Deborah Grotfeldt created the concept of the Young Mothers Residential Program, which began operations in 1996; Grotfeldt had worked with Lowe since the Project Row Houses project started. The program gives single mothers one year of housing to allow them to finish their education and organize themselves. Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times said \\"It has been as successful as the artist residency program.\\" But they weren't trying to do something to serve the arts community;they were trying to figure out how the arts community could serve this community. So after listening to tragic stories about teen pregnancy, rape and the large number of households being led by single parents, they decided that they could utilize single mothers as a symbol for the need for housing in this community. As of 2009 the Project Row Houses campus had 40 properties. As of that year, some houses have art exhibitions and some houses provide housing space for resident artists. Newer low income housing blocks, using designs provided by the Rice Building Workshop, are now a part of the campus. The program for young mothers uses seven shotgun houses. A playground is adjacent to those houses. In addition, several shotgun houses built in the Victorian era, moved there earlier from historically black communities under development, are a part of the campus. For those not clear on where the \\"art\\" comes in, one mother's epiphany provides an answer. \\"She was initially perplexed about the relationship between the artists and herself,\\"Lowe says. \\"Then she said, 'I get it. My life is a work of art too.\\" The Eldorado Ballroom and the Bert Long sculpture \\"Field of Vision\\" are a part of the campus. Lisa Gray of the Houston Chronicle said during that year \\"Driving around, this writer found it's hard to tell where the Row Houses campus begins and ends.\\" = Resident alumni of Artist Rounds = * Terry Adkins * Edgar Arceneaux *Michelle Barnes * William Cordova * Erika DeFreitas * Brendan Fernandes * Coco Fusco * Charles Gaines * Leslie Hewitt * Ayana Jackson * Ayanna Jolivet McCloud * Rodney McMillian * Charles Huntley Nelson * Mendi & Keith Obadike *Lovie Olivia *Robert Pruitt * Kameelah Janan Rasheed * Martine Syms *Tatyana Fazlalizadeh *Autumn Knight *Otobong Nkanga * Question Bridge: Black Males ( Chris Johnson, Bayete Ross Smith, Hank Willis Thomas and Kamal Sinclair)  Funding  In 2006, the Houston City Council gave Project Row Houses a grant of $975,000.

Early life and family Fitzmaurice was the younger son of John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne. His father was the second surviving son of Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry, and his wife Anne Petty, daughter of Sir William Petty. His father changed his surname in 1751 on inheriting the estates of his uncle, Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, and was himself created Viscount Fitzmaurice in 1751 and Earl of Shelburne in 1753. His elder brother William was an MP before he inherited the family titles on his father's death in 1761; he later became Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1782 and was created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. His brother changed his surname to Petty, but Thomas retained the Fitzmaurice name. Fitzmaurice was educated at Eton College. From 1759 to 1761, as a student, Thomas boarded with the philosopher and economist Adam Smith who was teaching at Glasgow University. Career Lleweni Hall, 1792 He was called to the bar at Middle Temple. In 1777 he married Mary O'Brien (1755-1831), who became suo jure 4th Countess of Orkney in 1791. Their son, born in 1778, was John Fitzmaurice, Viscount Kirkwall; he died before his mother, but Viscount Kirkwall was the father of the 5th Earl of Orkney, Thomas John Hamilton Fitzmaurice. Thomas and William Fitzmaurice enjoyed a close relationship, both as brothers and in parliament where Thomas \\"naturally followed his brother's lead\\". William briefly served as MP for Chipping Wycome in 1760‚Äì61. After William was elevated to the House of Lords, he arranged for Thomas to replace Isaac Barr√© as Member of Parliament for Calne in December 1762. Thomas represented Calne unopposed until 1774, when he moved to Chipping Wycome, another rotten borough controlled by his brother, exchanging seats with Barr√©. However, whereas William eventually became Prime Minister of Great Britain, Thomas Fitzmaurice had left Parliament by 1780, replaced in Chipping Wycome by Charles Stanhope. In 1776 Fitzmaurice bought the Lleweni Hall estate in Denbighshire from Sir Robert Cotton for ¬£110,000, where he established a large, Palladian-style factory, long, to bleach linen from his Irish estates. He was High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1781-2 and High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1783. He sought a private prosecution of William Davies Shipley, Dean of St Asaph, for seditious libel, for publishing a leaflet advocating political reforms in 1783, leading to the notorious case of the Dean of St Asaph. Later life Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire His wife succeeded as Countess of Orkney in 1791, and they moved to Cliveden. He died in Hampshire.

The restaurant sits on the corner of Stockton Street and Filbert Street, across from Washington Square Park. Founded in 1964, Mama's serves breakfast, brunch, and lunch as well as its own baked goods and gift baskets. The restaurant specializes in omelettes, salads, and sandwiches, and sells homemade jam, fresh baked bread, and pastries. History =Herbert Sherbet Shop: 1951‚Äì1964= In 1946, Michael Joseph Sanchez Sr. and Frances Muriel Lent married in San Francisco. By 1951, the couple had four children and decided to lease a small business location at 1701 Stockton Street in North Beach. There, they opened an ice cream and confectionery shop called Herbert's Sherbet.Holloway, Jan \\"Remembering Mama\\" (PDF) Frances helped run the ice cream and candy shop, while Michael sold life insurance policies for Occidental Life from a back office. Earlier, as a young man, Michael had had a small produce company with two of his brothers. They imported limes from Mexico, their native country, before immigrating with their family to San Francisco in 1927. The Sanchezes became a vital part of the tight-knit North Beach community among its mostly native Italian shopkeepers, bakers, coffee roasters, and bar and restaurant owners of the early 20th century. = Mama's on Washington Square: 1960s = Thirteen years later, the Sanchezes decided to try their hand at the restaurant business. They took the wall down between the back office and the ice cream store, and in 1964, the location was remodeled into a cozy, 14-table restaurant that Michael named the \\"Mama's on Washington Square.‚Äù He used a heart instead of an apostrophe to honor Frances, who by then was \\"Mama\\" to their eight children. The fresh inspiration of Mama's unique American cuisine-style breakfast menu, fresh seafood, vegetable, and fruit salads, and Italian baguette sandwiches attracted long lines that grew outside the restaurant as Mama and Papa cooked side-by-side with Italian native, Mary Balzarini, and a loyal staff who served the crowds. In 1970, ‚ÄúPapa\\" gave the restaurant to \\"Mama\\" as a personal gift. He went on to create \\"Mama's of San Francisco,\\" a corporation formed to expand the Mama's brand under Macy's of California in its flagship store at Union Square. It was an instant success. Long lines of customers snaked throughout Macy's Cellar in 1972 to eat at the expanded Mama's at Macy's Cellar. Sanchez opened eight Mama's locations in total, with several in the South Bay Area at Macy's Stores, as well as a flagship location in the Gramercy Towers on Nob Hill, and another on the corner of Geary and Mason Street, all of which Sanchez closed by 1997. = 1970s‚Äì1990s = In 1971, San Francisco food critic Jack Shelton wrote: \\"the reason for Mama's appeal is Mama herself\\". She had become a beloved San Francisco personality, whom the public knew affectionately as the \\"Mama\\" who took care of her customers as if they were extended family. For solo diners, \\"Mama\\" would find an empty chair at any table, make introductions between customers, and set a warm family-style atmosphere of goodwill. When she wasn't cooking on the line, she could be found serving meals or refilling coffee cups, delighted to mingle among her customers. Frances \\"Mama\\" Sanchez was truly everyone's \\"Mama\\" to her staff, and as her children, their school friends, and extended family all worked on weekends and on summer break as they were growing up. Mama's on Washington Square imbued the diversity of the colorful neighborhood of writers, poets, politicians, and travelers, attracting celebrities from Los Angeles and New York not only as a top eatery, but also as a prime location for film and television. The quaint, authentic charm of Mama's Victorian architecture, combined with the tall spires of Saints Peter and Paul Church and Washington Square Park, can be seen in films including Bullitt, Dirty Harry, What's up Doc, Pete and Tilly, and episodes of the popular series The Streets of San Francisco, starring Michael Douglas and Karl Malden. Throughout the 70s and 80s \\"Mama\\" was a popular caterer of exclusive events in San Francisco and the Napa Valley, and she enjoyed occasional appearances cooking on regionally broadcast television programs in the Bay Area. Herb Caen, a daily columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, mentioned \\"Mama\\" often for her charitable work and appearances. She was featured for her culinary expertise in Sunset, Gourmet, and San Francisco magazines. Among her many admirers in the food industry were world-renowned chefs Julia Child and James Beard. As a renowned San Francisco public figure, Frances \\"Mama\\" Sanchez was an honored recipient of San Francisco's prestigious Key to the City award under Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Sanchez was recognized for her tireless and charitable commitment to the San Francisco chapter of Meals on Wheels, and for her love of the arts. She sat on the Boards of the American Conservatory Theater, the San Francisco Opera, the San Francisco Ballet, and the San Francisco Symphony. =1990s‚Äìpresent= By the mid-90s Frances' health deteriorated, and the couple retired from the day-to-day restaurant business that by then was in the care of their children. Eldest son Michael Sanchez Jr. and wife Debra Sanchez began operating the original Mama's on Washington Square around 1996. Frances \\"Mama\\" Sanchez died on August 13, 2000 in Marin County at the age of 72. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors adjourned their scheduled monthly meeting of August 21, 2000 in her honor. In a letter to her family from Mayor Willie Brown, Sanchez was heralded for her kindness and forty years of professional contributions. That year, Frances \\"Mama\\" Sanchez was immortalized by friends, family, and admirers as a part of the \\"Step into History\\" project, where five tiles bearing her name were engraved on the east side steps of Pioneer Park at Coit Tower, along with many of San Francisco's most recognized figures of the 20th century. Michael Sanchez Sr. died on August 31, 2008 at home in Marin County where he lived under the care of family until the age of 84. In 2012, the Sanchez family began efforts to open a second North Beach location in, what was then, a vacant pizza market on Vallejo Street. However, their plan was ultimately abandoned. Vince Sanchez of Mama‚Äôs cited stalled zoning changes and mounting costs as reasons for their decision. = Food = Mama's serves a variety of breakfast dishes that include omelettes, eggs Benedicts, French toast, and pancakes. Lunch items include sandwiches, burgers, entree salads, and side orders such as homemade fries, bagels, yogurt, and fresh fruit. Beverages include lemonade, cranberry juice, apple juice, grapefruit juice, soft beverage sodas, lattes, hot chocolates, and alcoholic beverages including wine and beer. Mama's Bake Shop sells carrot cake, poppy seed cake, homemade jam, brownies, and kugelhopf. The bakery items are available for pre-order, and can be pre-ordered in 48 hours in advance. During the holiday season, Mama's Bake Shop items can be purchased in a gift basket. Hours and location Mama's is located at 1701 Stockton St., at the edge of Washington Square Park. The restaurant is easily accessible by MUNI and cable car. Mama's is open from Tuesday to Sunday, from 8 am to 3 pm, and is always closed on Mondays. Reviews and news coverage In a June 2010 USA Today article, restaurant guide Zagat recommended Mama's for its Northwest omelette. Zagat also mentioned Mama's for \\"pancakes that are as light as a feather - close to perfect.\\" The restaurant has been recommended by food critiques from KQED's Check, Please!

This pitch is a much higher frequency than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling this whale's the blue whale (10‚Äì39 Hz) or fin whale (20 Hz). It has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency. It has been described as the \\"world's loneliest whale\\".  Characteristics  The sonic signature is that of a whale, albeit at a unique frequency. At 52 hertz, it is a little higher than the lowest note on a double bass. The call patterns resemble neither blue nor fin whales, being much higher in frequency, shorter, and more frequent. Blue whales usually vocalize at 10‚Äì39 Hz, fin whales at 20 Hz. The 52-hertz calls of this whale are highly variable in their pattern of repetition, duration, and sequence, although they are easily identifiable due to their frequency and characteristic clustering. The calls have deepened slightly to around 50 hertz since 1992, suggesting the whale has grown or matured. The track of the 52-hertz whale is unrelated to the presence or movement of other whale species. Its movements have been somewhat similar to that of blue whales, but its timing has been more like that of fin whales. It is detected in the Pacific Ocean every year beginning in August‚ÄìDecember, and moves out of range of the hydrophones in January‚ÄìFebruary. It travels as far north as the Aleutian and Kodiak Islands, and as far south as the California coast, swimming between 30 and 70 km each day. Its recorded distance traveled per season has ranged from a low of 708 km to a high of 11,062 km in 2002‚Äì03. Scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have been unable to identify the species of the whale. They speculate that it could be malformed or a blue whale hybrid. The research team has been contacted by deaf people who believe the whale may be deaf. Whatever biological cause underlies its unusually high frequency voice does not seem to be detrimental to its survival. The fact that the whale has survived and apparently matured indicates it is probably healthy. Still, its unique call is the only one of its kind detected anywhere and there is only one such source per season. Because of this, the animal has been called the loneliest whale in the world.  History  Approximate map of the 52-hertz whale's migration range The 52-hertz whale was discovered by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Its call was first detected in 1989, then again in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, following the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy partially declassified the recordings and technical specifications of its SOSUS anti- submarine hydrophone arrays, and made SOSUS available for oceanographic research. , the whale had been detected every year since.  In art  = Film = The animated short film entitled The Phantom 52 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019. The film is written and directed by Geoff Marslett, and stars Tom Skerritt as the loneliest whale. The Phantom 52 went on to play at over 60 film festivals worldwide and win a half dozen awards. A feature-length documentary entitled 52: The Search for the Loneliest Whale is in production, shot by Joshua Zeman, the director of Cropsey, and produced by Adrian Grenier. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the film was due for release sometime in 2018 but has not been released. The Loneliest, a short mockumentary film about two women searching for the loneliest whale, was made in April 2014 by Lilian Mehrel, with the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Stare Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m's 2018 film My Name is Batlir, Not Butler features the 52-hertz whale as both a character (mostly represented by a photo and voice-over) and as a metaphor for the loneliness of those who are different. The Taiwanese movie 52Hz, I Love You's title is inspired by the whale, using it as a metaphor for the loneliness experienced when looking for love. = Music = Montreal-based saxophone player and composer Colin Stetson's 2013 album New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light included a song entitled \\"Part of Me Apart From You\\". Though not explicitly written about the 52-hertz whale, when first performing the song live, he has remarked on at least several occasions that the story of the \\"loneliest whale\\" resonated deeply with his composition. \\"This whale is alone in a large body of water, swimming, singing its song, calling for a likeness it will never find,\\" he said by way of introducing the song at a performance at Toronto's Great Hall on 19 May 2013. \\"When I play this song, I can't help but think about this whale, who right at this very minute is singing alone.\\" South Korean group BTS's 2015 album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 includes the track \\"Whalien 52\\", which explicitly uses the 52-hertz whale as a metaphor for the alienation from others often felt by adolescents. The English folk duo Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman included the song \\"52 Hertz\\" on their 2015 album Tomorrow Will Follow Today. The song is about the whale and includes the line, \\"52 Hertz, 52 Hertz, I'm singing a love song that no-one can hear\\" in the chorus. In 2018, American singer Chrysta Bell released a song called \\"52 Hz\\", inspired by the whale.

The catchment area is . The Letsibogo Dam on the Motloutse has been built to serve the industrial town of Selebi-Phikwe and surrounding local areas, with potential for use in irrigation. Ecology A field survey of the region in January 1989, before the dam was built, recorded 120 species of birds, mostly small insectivores. A relatively large number of water birds were found due to the presence of permanent pools on the Motloutse river downstream from its confluence with the Letlhakane river. The species of bird were generally typical for the region. Before the dam was built, five or more pioneer fish species would migrate upstream from the Limpopo River into the Motloutse River during floods. The Letsibogo dam was expected to support a permanent fish population similar to that of the Shashe Dam. Water resource Mean annual precipitation is , while mean annual potential evapotranspiration is . Due to this difference, the river is an ephemeral sand river with surface flow only during the rainy season. Rainfall is also highly variable, with rains of under 40% of the average expected one year in seven. Mean annual runoff is . Mineral resources Gold mining along the Motloutse and Limpopo rivers started around 1200 CE, about the time that Great Zimbabwe rose to become a regional power. Gold was found in 1860 in the old workings near Francistown, to the north of the river, causing the first small gold rush in Africa. The first authenticated diamonds to be found in Botswana were three small stones discovered in 1959 by the Central African Selection Trust in gravels in the Motloutse River near Foley Siding. The team that found the diamonds examined the river up to its headwaters, but found no likely source. In 2004, geologist Leon Daniels identified a warp in the earth's crust stretching from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe to the south of Botswana. He speculated that before the warp formed, the Motoutse river could have risen much farther to the west. Eventually, he found the huge Orapa kimberlite.

The Gazette, August 11, 2012. Owned by Evanov Radio Group, the station broadcast an adult standards radio format, along with some multicultural programming. CHRF's studios were located on Papineau Avenue in the Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie borough of Montreal, while its transmitter is located near Mercier.  History  =Preparing to broadcast= Between its sign-on in 1959 until 1990, 980 in Montreal was the home of CKGM, for many of those years, Montreal's leading English-language Top 40 station. Then from 1990 until 2012, CKGM was heard at 990, so it could broadcast at 50,000 watts fulltime, the maximum power permitted for Canadian AM stations. In 2012, CKGM moved to an even better frequency, clear channel Class A 690, leaving 980 or 990 available for another Montreal AM station to use. Several applicants sought permission to put a new station on the air using CKGM's old frequency. The Evanov Radio Group was awarded a license by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 21, 2011, with the intent to air a francophone LGBT-based talk and music format similar to the company's CIRR-FM in Toronto.\\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-721\\". CRTC, November 21, 2011. CHRF was initially licensed to broadcast at the 990 kHz frequency previously occupied by CKGM.\\"TSN 990 Montreal Moves to 690 Tuesday\\". RadioInsight, August 31, 2012. At 990, the new station was to have begun operations in 2013, operating with a power of 50,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna at night in order to protect two Class A stations at that same frequency, Clear-channel station CBW in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and CBY in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador. On July 25, 2013, Evanov filed a request with the CRTC to relocate CHRF to 980, due to potential coverage problems using the directional antenna. There are no clear channel stations using 980, nor are there any close by that broadcast there currently. The closest ones are CFPL in London, Ontario; WCAP in Lowell, Massachusetts; WOFX in Troy, New York; and WTEM in Washington, D.C. In addition, the closest 980 allocation to Montreal has remained vacant since 1997, when CBV in Quebec City relocated to FM. The frequency change was approved on December 4, 2013.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-648, December 4, 2013 CKGM, the former occupant of 990, relocated there from 980 in 1990.\\"Radio Fiert√© requests frequency change, one-year extension to launch\\".

(It had been delayed from January 2015.) Programming on CHRF under the LGBT format was similar in style to its Toronto sister station CIRR-FM, and included morning program Les Barbus, hosted by Michel Duchesne and Sylvain Verstricht; Les matins lesbiens with V√©ronique Chevrier; afternoon program Marino et ses Diamants, hosted by Marie-No√´lle Gagnon (\\"Marino\\"); and drive- time program Les P√©tards, hosted by Joe Bocan and Miguel Doucet. Chart programs included Doucet's nightly Ta Playlist, and two Saturday chart shows, Le Top 10 Franco and Le Top Anglo, hosted by Duchesne, Verstricht and Doucet, plus a Sunday morning music show, La Chansonnette avec Marino. On December 1, 2015, CHRF dropped the \\"Radio Fiert√©\\" format after just 10 months, and began stunting with Christmas music as AM 980.CHRF Montreal Drops LGBT Format Much like its previous format, the station aired Christmas music in both English and French, while the station's imaging was completely in French, per condition of its license. =Switch to adult standards= On December 28, CHRF adopted an adult standards format, still as AM 980 (but with branding modelled upon Evanov's Jewel soft adult contemporary stations). The original plan was to play adult standards during daytime hours, while the station would air programming targeting the Haitian community during evening hours. Under the standards format and during the holidays, when the station switches to Christmas songs (which returned in 2016), all music broadcast on CHRF was automated, without using disc jockeys or live personalities.Fagstein: \\"Unanswered Questions going into 2016\\", January 9, 2016.

They were the first denomination to do this in Atlanta. The new building was called Wesley Chapel and was the first to have their current bell, which cost an additional $300. It was the only church mentioned in Gone With the Wind. Many daughter churches were formed as Wesley Chapel's congregation grew. They moved to a new Gothic cathedral in 1870. In 1902, the congregation sold the property to Asa Candler, where he founded the Coca-Cola Company. The current building was built in 1903 using granite from Stone Mountain for $161,000.

The climate is tropical and semi-arid, with 90% of rainfall during the period from November to March. Mean annual precipitation is about in the catchment area above the dam. It is very variable, with rainfall less than 40% of the average expected in one year in seven. In August 2012 the dam was only one third full, prompting concerns that there could soon be water shortages in the areas of the areas of Palapye, Mahalapye and Gaborone.

The author, Tom Holland, had previously written two works on ancient history: Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic, which charted the fall of the Roman Republic, and Persian Fire, which is an account of the Greco-Persian Wars during the 5th century BC. According to Holland, \\"To understand the origins of Islam, and why it evolved in the way that it did, we must explore the empires and religions of late antiquity\\". In this book, following the research by scholars of Oriental studies such as John Wansbrough and Fred Donner, Holland suggests that Islam, rather than originating in the arid deserts of Arabia, was born further north, \\"in the borders of Syria-Palestine, a region that had long been devastated by plagues and wars ‚Äî the usual precursors of apocalyptic scenarios and millennial hopes.\\" While researching the book, Holland found that the oldest extant biography of Muhammad was written nearly two hundred years after he had died, and that scholars were unsure on how much early Islamic history could be considered accurate. \\"The challenge with adopting this [historical] approach\\", says the author, \\"by looking at Qur'an in its historical context ‚Äì which in any other field of history would be wholly uncontroversial ‚Äì is that Muslim accounts of its composition, all of them written long after the lifetime of Muhammad, and often in direct contradiction of the Quran itself, are the only accounts we possess.\\"  Reception  The book sharply divided critics, with some lauding Holland's take on the subject matter and others accusing him of dismissing centuries of Muslim scholarship. =Favorable reviews= Dan Jones, writing for the Telegraph, praised Holland for \\"a work of impressive sensitivity and scholarship\\". He described Holland as \\"one of the most distinctive prose stylists writing history today, and he drags his tale by the ears, conjuring the half-vanished past with such gusto that characters and places fairly bound from the page.\\" Jones finished his review by asking, \\"Is this Satanic Verses territory?\\" Holland quotes Salman Rushdie at the very beginning of the book, acknowledging, wryly, another British author who ventured onto the sticky wicket of Islam‚Äôs origin myths.\\" Anthony Sattin, writing in The Guardian, called Holland a \\"skilful and energetic narrator\\" and said \\"The lives of some people who have dared to question the historicity of the prophet Muhammad and the Qur'an have been ruined, even ended. We must hope that Holland is spared their wrath and that his excellent book will be lauded, as it should be, for doing what the best sort of books can do ‚Äì examining holy cows.\\" Barnaby Rogerson, writing for The Independent, said that though the book had a few \\"slight flaws\\" it remained \\"a spell-bindingly brilliant multiple portrait of the triumph of monotheism in the ancient world.\\" =Negative reviews= Ziauddin Sardar, writing for the New Statesman, said that the book is \\"revisionist history based almost exclusively on the work of a largely discredited group of orientalists. In the process, he pours scorn on Muslim scholarship, which is declared unsound, if not totally worthless, and lays into classical Muslim biographers and historians. Innocent readers will no doubt conclude that Muslims know nothing about Muhammad or the Quran. Apparently, our historians knew little about objectivity or criticism, which is the sole preserve of Holland and his orientalist friends!...His message is tailor-made for a time when Islamophobia is a global fashion, and everything that is labelled 'Islamic' or 'Muslim' is looked upon with suspicion.\\" He finished his critique with, \\"I find Holland‚Äôs total dismissal of Muslim scholarship arrogant (which I know he is not), insulting (which I know he does not mean to be) and based on spurious scholarship (though his scholarship is usually sound).\\" Historian Glen Bowersock, writing in The Guardian, called the book \\"irresponsible and unreliable\\" and said that Holland's \\"cavalier treatment of his sources, ignorance of current research and lack of linguistic and historical acumen serve to undermine his provocative narrative. In the Shadow of the Sword seems like an attempt by author, agent and publisher to create a very different account of early Islam, but fortunately the quality of the book stands in the way.\\" He criticized the work for ignoring \\"many of the most important recent discoveries,\\" such as \\"the large number of inscriptions from late antique south Arabia\\" and \\"early Qur'an manuscripts\\" dated to the 7th century. Holland responded to Bowersock's review by writing, \\"Bowersock is a formidable scholar for whom I have great admiration ‚Äì and his most recent work on ancient Ethiopia shows him to be as on the ball as ever. But this review, which is targeted not just at me but at an entire efflorescence in contemporary scholarship, is unworthy of him. Far from it being inappropriate to place the rise of Islam in the context of 'languages and ideas floating around in the Near East', the truly inappropriate thing, I would suggest, is to veil an important trend in scholarship from the gaze of the general public, and to scold those who would seek to lift it.\\" See also *Islam: The Untold Story *Seeing Islam as Others Saw It References External links * History books about Islam 2012 non-fiction books British non-fiction books ","title":"In the Shadow of the Sword (book)"},{"id":"37042626","text":"Wakatenry≈´ Yuzo (born 1 January 1940 as Tatsuo Nakagawa) is a former sumo wrestler from Ky≈çto, Japan.

The club was founded in 1887 and fields teams in hurling and Gaelic football. Newcastle West Club Rooms History Caisleain Nua Thiar Gaa Club was founded in 1897. Its early years were lean as Newcastle West did not emerge until 1908, when it reached the Senior final with Kilmallock, losing 2-08 to 0-3. Newcastle West footballers were still playing senior football through the 1900s up to 1928, where Glin beat them in the west final of that year by 0-12 to 0-01. As a hurling club, they had no success prior to World War 1. However from 1917 to 1933, Newcastle West were a force to be reckoned with, winning west titles and contesting 7 senior county finals during this period, winning in 1917 vs. Young Irelands (3-4 to 3-1) and in 1925 vs. Buff (3-2 to 1-2). The 1918 decider vs. Claughan was not played and they played second fiddle to Young Irelands in 1920 (5-4 to 1-1), Claughan in 1926 (1-4 to 5-3), and Young Irelands again both in 1930 (2-2 to 1-4) and 1932 (1-3 to 2-6). Their golden age in top flight Hurling ended in 1932. The late 1930s they found success for minor hurlers, winning a first county title in that grade, beating Claughan 7-5 to 0-1, and they reclaimed the County Junior Football title in 1938 beating Killmallock 0-4 to 0-3. The 1940s began with a win in a West minor hurling title, while losing the county final to Ahane (6-1 to 3-1). This title, along with a West Junior Football title in 1945, were its only successes on the GAA Field until 1949, when another minor hurling team won a west title. In the 1950s they met success in the west, both in minor hurling and football and junior football. The major change was the acquisition and development of the field in the Demense. In the 1960s they won the County junior final, beating Monaleen 2-2 to 2-0, and the club continued this success on the football field with a win in the West minor final in 1962, beating Abbeyfeale 3-5 to 2-7 and in 1965 winning the U21 beating Glin 2-3 to 0-4. A fourth County junior football title was secured in 1966, beating St Patrick‚Äôs 1-12 to 1-5. Progress was also made in the game of hurling, winning west minor titles in 1960, 1961 and 1965. Bord Na N'og emerged in the 1970s, for under-16s. They won a county U21 Football Championship in 1975, beating Na Piarsaigh 1-6 to 1-5. Newcastle won West Senior Football titles in 1971 and 1972, beating Glin and Askeaton, respectively. The footballers lost the county Senior Football title in 1972 to Askeaton. In the 1980s, the club enjoyed success in hurling and football field with many dual stars. These players won a number of county titles including Minor Hurling in 1982, Minor football in 1980 and 1983, U21 hurling in 1985, U21 football in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987 and the Senior county football title in 1987. In the juvenile section, after the success of the 1980s hurling declined and the club went from senior to junior. Football remained strong and it won a second county title in 1992 along with multiple west championships. The hurling decline was later addressed by winning Juvenile County‚Äôs through the 1990s in all age groups. The club celebrated a county junior hurling win in 2001. They experienced success at under-age level through the 2000s. A county senior football appearance in 2004 was followed by relegation in 2005. However a county Intermediate Football final win was celebrated in 2006. Through the late 2000s, success came in both minor hurling and football along with U-21 football. The senior footballers contested the Senior County Football Finals of 2011 and 2012, losing in 2011 to Monaleen and in 2012 to Drom-Broadford after a replay. In 2012, the club scored Junior B County Football League and Championship double and Premier Under-21 Football titles. The club also won two more u21 premier Football Championships, feeding the senior footballers with an extremely talented group of players for the coming years. In 2015 Newcastle won their first senior title in 23 years with a 2-10 to 0-9 win over Drom-Broadford. On 27 October 2019, the club's senior footballers won their fourth county senior championship title, defeating Oola.

He was the son of Wertislaw, Lord of Rostock and Prince of the Obotrites. He fought together with the Danes and Frederick I against Henry the Lion. Between 1183 and 1185, he fought a war against his cousin Henry Borwin I. Nicholas received support from the Danes; Henry Borwin I received no outside support. King Canute VI of Denmark noticed this lack of support and used the opportunity to strengthen his position on the Baltic Sea coast. In 1185, Nicholas I and Henry Borwin I had to accept Canute VI as their liege lord. In return, Canute enfeoffed Nicholas I with the Lordship of Rostock. On 25 May 1200, Nicholas I and Henry Borwin fought the Battle of Waschow, as part of a war against Count Adolf III of Holstein.

The regiment served with distinction in North-west Europe from July 1944 to May 1945. Origin 107th Regiment RAC was formed on 1 November 1941 by the conversion to the armoured role of the 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), a 1st Line Territorial Army infantry battalion. In common with other infantry units transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, all personnel would have continued to wear their King's Own cap badge on the black beret of the RAC.Forty pp. 50‚Äì1. In this instance, however, the brass cap badges of the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) were plated white metal, chrome or silver by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment had been serving in 126th Infantry Brigade of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, which had fought in France and been evacuated at Dunkirk in May 1940. Later, these formations were redesignated 11th Armoured Brigade (later 11th Tank Brigade) and 42nd Armoured Division respectively.Joslen, pp. 29, 68, 165, 199. Serving alongside the regiment in the brigade were 110 RAC (previously 5th Borders) and 111 RAC (5th Manchesters). Based in Yorkshire (mainly at Keighley and later Leyburn), the regiment trained on Valentine tanks throughout 1942 and early 1943.107 RAC War Diaries February‚ÄìDecember 1942, The National Archives, Kew file WO 166/6929. Training In January 1943, 11th Tank Brigade was attached to 77th Infantry (Reserve) Division and given the role of holding and training replacements.Joslen, pp. 100, 199. Consequently, 107 RAC became an advanced training regiment, taking in men who had completed individual training at the training regiments, forming them into crews with responsibility for their own tanks, and instructing them in troop and finally squadron tactics.107 RAC War Diary February 1943, The National Archives, file WO 166/11100.

Disbandment and Re-creation In Autumn 1943, the decision was made to disband 11th Tank Brigade, without it ever having seen active service,Joslen, pp. 199. and, on 8 September, 107 RAC was ordered to disperse. Most of the regiment's personnel were transferred to other RAC regiments, and disbandment was completed on 31 December. A 'token party' of three officers and 47 other ranks from 107 RAC was sent to 151st Regiment Royal Armoured Corps ‚Äì which had been converted from the 10th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment, a hostilities-only unit created in 1940.107 RAC War Diaries September‚ÄìDecember 1943, The National Archives, file WO 166/11100. The 151st Regiment RAC formed part of 34th Tank Brigade, which also included 147 RAC (formerly 9th Hampshire Regiment) and 153 RAC (formerly 8th Essex Regiment). The brigade was based at Folkestone in Kent, and also equipped with Churchills. On 30 December 1943, 151 RAC formally disbanded in order to adopt the number of 107 RAC ‚Äì thus perpetuating the link with the 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment, a permanent '1st Line' Territorial Army battalion as opposed to the 'hostilities-only' 10th Battalion that had been converted to 151 RAC.Joslen, p. 207.151 RAC (10th King's Own) War Diary November 1943 Appendix F, The National Archives file WO 166/11115. Normandy At the beginning of July 1944, 107 RAC embarked at Gosport for Normandy with the rest of 34th Tank Brigade107 RAC War Diary July 1944, The National Archives, file WO171/876. Fighting in the Normandy Campaign as an independent brigade under 21st Army Group command, it could be assigned to support any infantry division that required the assistance of tanks, its regiments usually split up to form brigade groups with the infantry. 107 RAC went into action on 15 July during Operation Greenline, part of the Second Battle of the Odon, designed to pin German forces so that they could not interfere with the planned breakout from the Normandy beachhead (codenamed Operation Cobra).Ellis, Vol I, p. 334. The regiment supported 15th (Scottish) Division in a night attack towards Evreux. 107 RAC's War Diary records that 'the attack from the inf. point of view was a complete success', but complains that the regiment's tanks were blinded by the 'excellent' smoke laid down by the artillery and infantry, and were late withdrawing the following day. The regiment had lost six tanks, with six men killed, seven wounded, and one missing. On 22 July 107 RAC supported troops of 53rd (Welsh) Division in a raid, and then went to support 59th (Staffordshire) Division in case of counter-attack. Lt Fathergill, OC 'B' Squadron, 107 RAC, 34th Tank Brigade, with his crew on their Churchill tank, 17 July 1944. On 7 August 107, RAC moved up in support of 176th Brigade of 59th Division who had established a bridgehead across the River Orne. A Squadron managed to ford the river, followed by C Sqn. The Germans put in a vigorous counter-attack and some of the British infantry withdrew, leaving 107 RAC's two forward squadrons exposed to attacks by Tiger and Panther tanks. Despite heavy casualties, the bridgehead was held, but 107's shattered squadrons had to be reformed as a single composite squadron until the regiment could be withdrawn from the line on 19 August.Ellis, Vol I, p. 408.107 RAC War Diary August 1944, The National Archives, file WO171/876. Out of the line to reorganise, the regiment received the whole of C Squadron of 153 RAC, which was being broken up to provide replacements, due to a shortage of manpower. This became a new C Squadron for 107 RAC. By early September, the regiment was sufficiently reorganised to take part in Operation Astonia, the attack on Le Havre. On 11 September, 107 RAC attacked in support of 147th Brigade of 49th (West Riding) Division, attacking the high ground on the North East side of the port. The tanks picked their way through lanes cut through the minefields by flail tanks and went on to assist the infantry in mopping up machine gun positions and (with some Churchill Crocodile flamethrowers under command) to clear buildings. The following day, 107 RAC's tanks took up hull-down positions on the high ground and gave fire support to the infantry advance on the town, which fell later that day.Ellis, Vol II, p. 14.107 RAC War Diary September 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/876. Clarkeforce 107 RAC was back in the line in early October, supporting small-scale infantry operations and standing ready to counter- attack if called upon. On 18 October, it became part of 'Clarkeforce', a mobile column commanded by Brigadier W.S. Clarke of 34th Tank Brigade. As part of operations on the Belgian‚ÄìDutch border to clear the approaches to the port of Antwerp, 49 Division was to attack towards Loenhout, and then unleash Clarkeforce to exploit the breakthrough and move up the main road to Wuustwezel (Operation Rebound). Clarkeforce was launched at 16.00 on 20 October as part of a large offensive - Operation Pheasant which was designed to liberate much of North Brabant. The Churchills of 107 RAC's C Sqn carried D Company of the 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, and the regiment was accompanied by a troop of Achilles self-propelled 17-pounders from 248 Battery, 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery,RA 1939‚Äì45 62 A/Tk Rgt and a troop of Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks of the 1st Fife and Forfar Yeomanry. Fire support was provided by 191st (Hertfordshire and Essex Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. Progress was not fast: the column was restricted to one tank's width, and the M3 Stuart ('Honey') light tanks of 107's Recce Troop were held up by the bad tank going, but the leading squadrons moved on in the approaching darkness to allow C Sqn and the infantry to clear Wuustwezel, taking some prisoners. 'The night was pitch dark, it was raining, and there was no moon', and the Recce Trp scouting ahead were held up by a roadblock of trees, which were cleared by the leading Churchills. After a short rest, the regiment moved on at 0800 the following morning towards Nieuwmoer. By now the Recce Troop had run out of fuel, and the advance was led by A Sqn of 49 (West Riding) Reconnaissance Regiment RAC. When they came across a bridge that had been blown, the tanks had to fan out to the flanks in search of alternative crossings, and with no cover they were engaged over the flat country by German Self-Propelled guns. The advance had to be covered by smoke. Once clearance of the village was well in hand, the Recce Trp came up and pushed on carelessly into a wood occupied by German troops and SP guns. Four Honeys were knocked out, bringing the regiment's casualties to eight tanks in the day. On 22 October, the advance continued towards Esschen, 107 RAC engaging enemy infantry and SP guns. The regiment's A Echelon vehicles, following behind, were ambushed and further casualties received. For the next day's advance, the Leicesters were relieved by two companies from 7th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, who attacked Schanker successfully with C Sqn's Churchills on 24 October.107 RAC War Diary October 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/876.34 Tank Bde War Diary October 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/643.Sainsbury, pp. 239_43. After a day's pause for planning, Clarkeforce was launched for a second time on 26 October for Operation Thruster towards Roosendaal. Clarkeforce pushed on towards Brembosch, losing four tanks and an SP gun from 245 Bty, 62nd A/Tk Regt. The following day, 107 RAC supported the 1st Leicesters in an attack along the Brembosch‚ÄìWouwse Hil road, and reached Oostlaar by nightfall. At first light, while replenishing their tanks, C Sqn came under fire, lost some vehicles and had to withdraw under smoke and covering fire, but at 0815 the regiment was ready to support an attack by 11th Royal Scots Fusiliers and cut the Wouw‚ÄìBergen-op-Zoom road, despite enemy SP guns. The advances were masked by smoke and covered by the remaining Achilles. The last day of Operation Thruster saw 107 RAC positioned to support an attack by 146th Infantry Brigade and the 9th Royal Tank Regiment. 107 RAC was withdrawn to Wouwe on 31 October to reorganise. Netherlands After a period of maintenance, 107 RAC was temporarily attached to 31st Tank Brigade (part of 79th Armoured Division, equipped with specialist armour) and on 3 December went into action at Blerick in support of 15th (Scottish) Division in XII Corps. This well-planned and executed Corps attack on this heavily defended suburb of the Dutch town of Venlo (Operation Guildlford), was accompanied by strong artillery and Typhoon support, preceded by flail tanks to breach minefields, bridge-laying AVREs to cross an anti-tank ditch, and with a well-executed cover plan that misled the enemy as to the direction from which the attack would come. The objectives were achieved with remarkably few casualties.107 RAC War Diary December 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/876.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 160‚Äì1.

He holds two Michelin stars at his restaurant Bo Innovation and one Michelin star at Bo London. He is nicknamed The Demon Chef, and has invented his own cuisine which he calls X-Treme Chinese, which includes meals such as an edible condom on a mushroom beach. He spent ¬£1.7 million on his second restaurant, Bo London, based in Mayfair, London. It closed after a year in business.http://londoneater.com/2013/03/18/bo-london/ Another restaurant, Bo Shanghai was opened in Shanghai, China. Career Leung was born in London in 1961 as the eldest of four brothers, and was raised in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. His first job in the culinary world was as a waiter, but afterwards trained as an engineer. He moved to Hong Kong and purchased a speakeasy called \\"Bo Inosaki\\" for ¬£3,000, renaming it Bo Innovation. A self- taught chef, Leung gave himself the nickname \\"The Demon Chef\\", and is known for a style of cooking he calls \\"X-Treme Chinese\\". He describes the Demon moniker as coming from the Greek word \\"Daim√¥n\\", meaning \\"good-spiritedness\\". While X-Treme Chinese is a combination of fusion cuisine and molecular gastronomy, and is meant to show that the food he creates is pushing the limits. His dishes at Bo Innovation include one called \\"Sex on a Beach\\" which involves an edible condom made out of a konjac and kappa on a beach made of mushroom. The condom itself is filled with a mixture of honey and ham. All of the proceeds from that dish go to charity AIDS Concern. His restaurant in Hong Kong received two stars in the Michelin Guide's inaugural 2009 Hong Kong and Macau edition, then upgraded to three stars in 2014 edition, and by 2012 was ranked in 52nd place in the list of the World's Best Restaurants. In December 2012, Leung opened a second restaurant, Bo London, in London, United Kingdom. Within 10 months of opening, Bo London had gained its first Michelin star. Leung said that he intends for it to serve classic British fare such as dishes commonly served at bed & breakfasts, but with Chinese ingredients. He spent ¬£500,000 on the site in Mill Street, Mayfair, and together with equipping the restaurant is expected to spend around ¬£1 million on the restaurant. In March 2014, the restaurant closed following a 'serious water leak'. It did not reopen. He appeared on episode eight of the Bravo cooking travel show Around the World in 80 Plates. The episode was named after him, entitled \\"Feeding the Demon\\". Alongside the winner of MasterChef Canada Season 1, Eric Chong, Leung opened a restaurant called R&D; in Toronto. The restaurant was opened in early 2015 and is named after the nicknames for Chong and Leung respectively, Rebel and Demon. Leung serves as one of three judges in MasterChef Canada. He also serves as one of the judges in MediaCorp Channel 5's Wok Stars. He was also in the show The Listener Episode \\"Amuse Bouche\\" as a judge in a reality TV show, Five Star Chef. In October 2017 it was announced that Leung is opening a Spanish restaurant called Plato 86 and a Peking duck diner called The Forbidden Duck in Hong Kong. In April 2018, Leung will extend his success of his Hong Kong restaurant Forbidden Duck, opening another in Singapore. He is also set to debut his first book titled My Hong Kong.

The idea is to fire once, identifying the best market area to enter and the marketing efforts on customers there, like aiming a rifle to hit the bull's red eye. One to One Marketing One to one marketing is targeting a specific group of audience and then carrying out our marketing strategies. Four trends will support the ongoing growth of one to one marketing. * The one-size-fits-all marketing of the yesteryear is no longer relevant. Customers do not want to be treated like masses; they need to be treated like individuals as they are, with their own unique sets of needs and wants. By its personalized nature, one-to-one marketing can fulfill this desire. * More direct and personal marketing will continue growing to meet the needs of the customers who no longer have time to spend in shopping and making purchase decisions. With the personal and targeted nature of one-to-one marketing, consumers can spend less time making purchase decisions. * Consumers will be loyal only to those companies and brands that earn their loyalty and reinforce it at every purchase occasion. One-to-one marketing techniques focus on finding a firm's best customers, rewarding them for their loyalty, and thanking them for their business. * Mass-media approaches will decline as advances in market research and database technology enable marketers to collect detailed information on their customers, not just the approximation offered by demographics but the specific names and addresses. New technology offers one-to-one marketers a more cost-effective way to reach customers and enables businesses to personalize their messages. For example, MyYahoo.com greets each user by name and offers information in which the user has expressed interest. Benefits of Rifle Approach (Market Segmentation) Rifle marketing first identifies the target customers within a market and has its benefits like : * By tailoring programs to individual segments, marketers can make efficient use of marketing resources. They are not wasting resources chasing customers whose needs would not be satisfied. * A small firm with limited resources can compete very effectively in one or two market segments, whereas the firm would be stretched very thinly if it tries to cater to the entire market. * By using product segmentation, companies can design products that closely match the needs of particular groups. * Advertising media can be more effectively used because promotional messages and the media chosen to present them can be specifically aimed towards each segment of the market.

He published his first short stories at the age of forty-five. Shortly thereafter he became one of Germany's most successful authors. His books, which have been translated into more than 35 languages, have sold millions of copies worldwide and have made him \\"an internationally celebrated star of German literature.\\"  Life and work  A member of the noble Sorbian (West Slavic) Schirach family, he is the son of Munich businessman Robert von Schirach (1938‚Äì1980) and his wife Elke (n√©e F√§hndrich, 1942)\\"Baldur Benedict von Schirach\\", Der Spiegel, 1962 No. 31, a grandson of the National Socialist youth leader Baldur von Schirach, and a great-grandson of Hitler‚Äôs official photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. His American great-grandmother is a descendant of two signatories of the American Declaration of Independence and descends from the Founding Fathers of the United States and the Mayflower pilgrims. He grew up in Munich and Trossingen and was educated at the Jesuit college Kolleg St. Blasien, about which he wrote in connection with sexual harassment in the Catholic Church in Der Spiegel.\\"Eine Jugend im Jesuiten-Internat St. Blasien\\", Der Spiegel, 2010 No. 6 After studies in Bonn and his Referendariat in Cologne and in Berlin he became an attorney in 1994, specialised in criminal law. Von Schirach is considered a prominent attorney and represented, among others, the BND spy Norbert Juretzko, and, in the so-called \\"Politb√ºro trial\\", G√ºnter Schabowski. He attracted attention in connection with the \\"Liechtenstein Tax Affair\\", in which charges were brought against the German Federal Intelligence Service Bundesnachrichtendienst and when he complained to the Berlin data protection agency on behalf of the family of the late actor Klaus Kinski, when it allowed the publication of Kinski's medical file. Schirach is active exclusively in the domain of criminal law. In August 2009, Schirach published the book Verbrechen (\\"Crime\\") with the publisher Piper Verlag. The book remained on Der Spiegel's bestseller list for 54 weeks. The collection of stories is based on cases from his chambers. Rights to the book were sold in more than 30 countries. In August 2010, his second book, Schuld (\\"Guilt\\") appeared, again with Piper Verlag, and again it contains short stories drawing on von Schirach's everyday experience as an attorney. In September 2011, Piper Verlag published Schirach's third book, Der Fall Collini (\\"The Collini Case\\"), which reached no. 2 on the bestseller list of Der Spiegel. The book tells of the murder of the industrialist Hans Meyer, who had been a Nazi officer in Italy. It deals, controversially, with the sometimes excessively mild ways in which the post-World War II justice system in Germany dealt with former Nazis. He has since published another collection of three short stories Carl Tohrbergs Weihnachten (\\"Carl Tohrberg's Christmas\\"), a second Novel Tabu (\\"The Girl Who Wasn¬¥t There\\"), a collection of the essays he wrote for Der Spiegel titled Die W√ºrde ist antastbar (\\"Dignity is violable\\", alluding to the first sentence of the German Constitution) and the theater play Terror. The play stages the court trial of an air force pilot accused of mass murder after having shot down a hijacked civil plane which was intended to crash into a soccer stadium. The audience gets to act as a jury and votes on the verdict on which the sentence at the end of the play is then based. In 2018, he published another collection of twelve short stories, titled Strafe (Punishment). As explained in an interview with Deutschlandfunk Kultur, Strafe completes the trilogy he began with Verbrechen und Schuld; he had always planned it to take this form. Each of the volumes corresponds to the examination order of an indictment in a criminal court of law.

He was born in Austerlitz, Moravia, on 6 March 1893 and died in Vienna on 27 April 1978. After early success at the Wiener Kunstakademie, where he received several awards including the Prix de Rome, the artist was later impeded in mid-career by the outbreak of war. Initially, enduring extreme poverty and oppressed by the First World War, he inclined towards melancholy subjects and an emotionally charged style with touches of the movement called Neue Sachlichkeit.Josef Gassler 1893-1978. Catalogue with Vorwort by Rudolf Minichbauer, Galerie Walfischgasse, Wien, March 2010 Josef Gassler lived in Paris from 1927 to 1930, travelled in Italy and the South of France and to Prague, Karlovy Vary and Vienna. After settling in the Czech Republic, he spent winters in cosmopolitan Prague where gained recognition.Josef Gassler: The beginning of my journey, 1893-1916. Translated with an introductory note by Eve Stwertka. New York, Copyright 2005. He occasionally designed porcelain and glass for Moser and other Czechoslovak manufacturers and worked on murals and theatrical scenery. Gassler's career falteres with the coming of Fascism, when Germany introduced the concept of degenerate arts. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia was followed by World War II, in turn followed by Communist occupation. In 1945 Gassler returned to Vienna, where he continued to work, mainly painting portraits, landscapes and flower studies. Josef Gassler exhibited in the Salon des Independants, the Wiener Sezession, the Kuenstlerhaus, the Rudolfinum and in private galleries. On his 70th birthday he received the Golden Laurel award from the Wiener Kuenstlerhaus.

Forster was born on February 14, 1912 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Michael Joseph and Louise Barbara (n√©e Schmidt) Forster, and he died on February 23, 2006, also in Cincinnati. Education  Forster attended St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, garnering there an education in the classical languages of Greek and Latin. He then entered Xavier University, earning a B.S. degree in biology and chemistry in 1933, and was awarded an M.D. from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in 1937. Forster served as a rotating intern at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, and then completed a residency in neurology at Boston City Hospital under the tutelage of Tracy Putnam and H. Houston Merritt.Cajigal S: Dr. Francis M. Forster, founding father of AAN, dies. Neurology Today 2006; 6(6): 4. In the 1940s, training in neurology was paired inextricably with psychiatry, and Forster completed his postgraduate education in the latter discipline at the University of Pennsylvania. A Rockefeller Research Fellowship in neurophysiology followed thereafter at Yale University. Academic career Forster's first academic appointment was as an instructor in neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine, where he joined the faculty in 1941. Two years later he moved to Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where an interest developed in patients with epilepsy which would last for the rest of his career. Based largely on his research work in that area, Forster was invited to head the department of Neurology at Georgetown University School of Medicine as Professor & Chair, in 1950. At that institution, he expanded the teaching and clinical services in neuropsychiatry to include three affiliated hospitals in Washington, D.C., while continuing his personal research efforts in the study of epilepsy.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2006/03/08/AR2006030802421.html Frank's skills as an administrator were increasingly recognized by his peers at Georgetown, and when Paul McNally, the dean of the medical school, became ill with coronary artery disease in 1952, Forster was chosen as his replacement. He presided over a steady expansion in the curriculum and the physical facilities at Georgetown over the next five years. Even though Forster's style was conversational and collegial, he was extremely adept politically and saw a tripling of extramural grant funding at Georgetown during his deanship. In addition, the Gorman Diagnostic & Research Center was built there under his guidance. In 1958, Forster was asked to chair the department of Neurology at the University of Wisconsin Medical School (UWMS) in Madison, Wisconsin, where a new facility had been built specifically for neurological patients and their rehabilitative needs.Oliver R: Making the Modern Medical School: The Wisconsin Stories. Canton, MA: Science History Publications, 2002, pp. 1-165. He remained on the active teaching and research faculty of UWMS for the next 20 years, and was subsequently the director of the Forster Epilepsy Center at the William Shainline Middleton Veterans Administration Hospital http://www.madison.va.gov/services/epilepsy.asp in Madison until 1982.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4D81531F934A35750C0A9609C8B63 Forster then retired to Cincinnati, where he remained active in public affairs and in alumni activities at Xavier University and the University of Cincinnati until shortly before his death from congestive heart failure in 2006. During the course of his long career, Forster trained over 100 academic neurologists, 16 of whom went on to become university departmental chairpersons on an international scale. In addition, he published over 200 peer-reviewed papers and five textbooks in the medical literature, and contributed many chapters to other monographs on neurology. Professional activities In 1948, Forster worked together with Abraham B. Baker, Adolph Sahs, and Russell DeJong to create the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). They were thereafter known by Academy members as the founding \\"four horsemen,\\" Lanska D: Book Review: The Interface of Neurology & Internal Medicine. JAMA 2008; 299(8): 960-961. and the Francis Forster Fund at the AAN now honors Forster's contributions to the organization. He served as President of the AAN from 1957 to 1959, and was also President of the American Epilepsy Society and President of the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology. Forster was a consultant to the surgeons general of the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Public Health Service. Celebrity medical consultation Because of his stature as an internationally-known neurologist and his local prominence in the area of Washington, D.C., Forster was called as a consultant in November 1957 to treat President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had suffered a mild stroke. That episode resolved with no permanent disability for the chief executive, and Forster's role in the president's care further bolstered his reputation. He was next in the public eye in 1964, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the murder of Kennedy's probable killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Jack Ruby in November 1963. Ruby's attorney, Melvin Belli, developed a premise for the defense wherein his client's aggressive behavior was explained by the presence of psychomotor-type temporal lobe epilepsy. Forster examined Ruby, as well as electroencephalograms that had been taken from him, and testified against Belli's hypothesis along with other neurologists. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder in March 1964. (However his conviction was later reversed and he died awaiting a new trial, still legally presumed innocent.)New York Times- June 1, 1995www.history.co.uk-this-day-in-history/November-22 Forster also participated in 1958 in an international medical-exchange mission to the Soviet Union, visiting hospitals and clinics in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tiblisi, and Sukumi and conferring with Soviet physicians in those cities. That effort helped to improve Russo-American medical communications during the 1960s and thereafter. At other points in his career, Forster was asked to consult on the diagnosis and treatment of President Elpidio Quirino of the Philippines, President Eduardo Lonardi of Argentina, Cardinal Archbishop Albert Gregory Meyer of Chicago, and Archbishop Gabriel Reyes of the Philippines. Personal life Francis Forster married Helen Dorothy Kiley, a social worker, in 1937. They had five children together: Denis, Mark, Susan, Kathleen, and Marianne. His wife predeceased him in July 2004.Nicole Hamilton, \\"Helen Dorothy Forster, 91, worked as social worker\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, July 26, 2004.

Early life  Benedetto Erba was born on 7 August 1679 in Como to senator Antonio Maria Erba and Teresa Turconi. His great uncle was Pope Innocent XI, who died when Benedetto was 10 and from whom in 1709 Benedetto took his second surname Odescalchi (hence the lack of a hyphen). On 23 February 1700 Benedetto Erba earned a doctorate in utroque iure at the University of Pavia and he took up a career in the administration of the Papal States: in 1706 he became referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature, on 18 April 1709 he was appointed Vice- legate in Ferrara and on 31 July 1710 Vice-legate in Bologna, a position he kept until 10 September 1710. Already on 28 February 1689, with his tonsure, Benedetto Erba entered in the clerical state, and he was ordained deacon on 11 October 1711 and Priest a week later. He was appointed Titular archbishop of Thessalonica on 18 December 1711, and shortly after consecrated bishop in Rome by Cardinal Fabrizio Paolucci. On 25 January 1712 he became assistant at the Pontifical Throne. Benedetto Erba served as Apostolic Nuncio to Poland from 25 January 1712 to 5 October of the same year. Archbishop of Milan On 5 October 1712 Benedetto Erba was appointed Archbishop of Milan, however he entered in Milan only in August 1714 due to his ongoing diplomatic services. On 30 January 1713 he was appointed Cardinal Priest of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, a title he maintained until 1725 when he moved to the title of Santi XII Apostoli. As Archbishop of Milan he focused on pastoral activities, taking as examples Saint Charles Borromeo and Pope Innocent XI. He took care of the education of the secular priests and tried to reform the monasteries of nuns. In 1717 he made a pastoral visit to a remote area of the diocese, in the mountains of Ticino, and also in the following years he went on visiting the remote areas of his large diocese. Since 1723 he started the so-called Urban Missions in order to increase the religious sentiment of the town. He founded the seminary of St. John on the Wall in Milan, one of the largest in the town, on 22 July 1714 he approved the Congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Rho and in 1735 he authorized the erection of a house of Ursulines in Milan. In 1716 Benedetto Erba obtained from Pope Clement XI that the ordinary canon priests of the Cathedral of Milan could wear the white damask mitre in solemn celebrations. He personally supervised the restoration of the dome and of the crypt of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, decorating it with rococo style. Benedetto Erba was a great patron of culture and arts, as well as a collector of sculptures and paintings, and most of his gallery is now at the Diocesan Museum of Milan, including the 41 portraits of the first archbishops of Milan he commissioned since 1715. Even if under his reign the Duchy of Milan passed from the Spanish Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy, Benedetto Erba succeeded in maintaining good relations with all the political powers. He participated to the 1721, 1724 and 1730 Papal conclaves, and in all these three conclaves it was thought possible that he would be elected pope. In 1731 he suffered a stroke which impaired him for the following years. Due to this health problem, he resigned as Archbishop of Milan on 6 December 1736, and retired to live in his family house in Milan, where he died on 13 December 1740. He was buried in the nearby church of San Giovanni in Conca, which was demolished between the 19th and 20th century. His remains are now buried in the Cathedral of Milan.

Early life and education Lennert was born in F√ºrth, which is now contiguous with Nuremberg, in Bavaria. After graduating from high school there, Karl attended medical school from 1939 to 1945 at the Friedrich-Alexander Universitat of Erlangen (now the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg). After World War II, Lennert remained in Erlangen until 1950 as a resident physician in the Institute of Pathology. After another year of postgraduate study at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen, he joined the department of pathology at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt-am-Main. There, under the direction of Professor Arnold Lauche, he began his lifelong study of hematopoietic diseases, with emphasis on malignant lymphomas. Career  In 1963, Lennert was asked to chair the Institute of Pathology at Christian- Albrechts-University (CAU) in Kiel. This was a prestigious appointment, because at that time, 75% of department chairs at CAU were the sons of prominent Professors of Medicine in Germany. His students included Reza Parwaresch, Martin-Leo Hansmann, H.J. Radzun, Alfred Feller, Hans-Konrad M√ºller-Hermelink, and Peter M. Banks. Lennert worked closely with clinicians in the Collaborative Research Centre 111 of the German Research Foundation, principally represented by Drs. Arnulf Thiede and Wolfram Sterry. Lennert was the founding president of the European Association of Hematopathology. In 1989 he became a Professor Emeritus in Kiel.  Kiel Classification System for Lymphomas Around 1975, Lennert began work on a system of nosological classification for malignant lymph node tumors (non-Hodgkin lymphomas) that was predicated on the cytomorphological and biochemical attributes of developing lymphoid cells.Lennert K: Morphology and classification of malignant lymphomas and so-called 'reticuloses.' Acta Neuropathol 1975; Suppl 6: 1-16. It was meant to supplement or supersede other schemes that were existence at that time, including the Lukes-Collins system and the Rappaport classification. Lennert's paradigm quickly gained traction among pathologists in Europe and became known as the \\"Kiel classification\\". Later, other systems of nosology for malignant lymphoma were introduced, including the Revised European American Lymphoma Classification (REAL) scheme in 1994, and the World Health Organization system of 2001, which are now preferentially in clinical use. Dr. Lennert is also recognized for first describing a variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in 1952, which he termed \\"lymphoepithelioid lymphoma.\\" It is now commonly and eponymously called \\"Lennert's lymphoma.\\" In total, Lennert contributed over 300 scholarly papers and 4 textbooks to the medical literature during his working life. Lennert accumulated a large and unique teaching archive of lymphoma cases in his department at Kiel. He had developed a personal-professional relationship with Uwe Barschel, a prominent West German politician in the 1980s, and Barschel assured him that funds would be supplied to preserve the archive in a special institute at the time of Lennert's retirement. However, the politician was involved in a scandal in 1987 and he died at that time under questionable circumstances; hence, his promise to Dr. Lennert was never fulfilled. Honors and awards Lennert received several professional honors and awards during his long career. These included election to membership of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1966; the Schleiden Medal; the Robert Koch Medal; the Rudolf Virchow Medal and the Ernst Jung Prize. Lennert also received honorary doctorates from Friedrich-Alexander Universitat, the University of Gent, the University of Madrid, and the University of Koln.

Early life and education He was born in South Africa as the son of missionary pastor Jan Olaus Kielland (1833‚Äì98) and Hanna Olsen (1842‚Äì1913), and was married in 1900 to Alice Louise Franziska Traub (b. 1875). Kielland came from a shipowner family near Stavanger. In 1874 the family returned to Norway from Africa and Kielland began his studies, first at Oslo Cathedral School where he graduated in 1891. He studied medicine at the Royal Frederick University where he graduated with the medical degree in 1899. Career =Early career= After an internship at the hospital in Gravdal, Lofoten, he returned to Oslo in 1901 to work in the department of surgery at the Rikshospitalet. From 1902 to 1904 he worked in the Maternity-Foundation and was obstetrician at the University Clinic (). Here he developed a birth rod receiving considerable attention internationally. In the years 1911‚Äì14 he was the so-called senior registrar in Maternity-Foundation. He also worked in Copenhagen and the Catholic hospitals in Oslo. =Scientific and clinical research= Kielland proposed a new way to correct prolapse-uterus (uterine prolapse), which was well regarded abroad. His international reputation and fame rested yet completely at birth forceps that still bears his name. He started using this tool in 1908 at his practice. He was also a private assistant to Professor Kristian Brandt (1859‚Äì1932) in this period. Over the next seven years he collected data material on 352 cases of birth delivery. Kielland first presented the Kielland forceps in 1908 when he gave a lecture for the Surgical Society in Christiania titled \\"The Birth Forceps mechanism and technique\\". Two years later in 1910, he demonstrated his rod in Copenhagen and at various clinics in Germany. But it was not until 1915 during a visit to Munich Gynecological Society at the invitation of Professor D√∂derlein that his invention got the international recognition it has today. In 1916 Kielland publicized en a complete description of the forceps in a 31-page article in German, complete with user instructions. Although his new invention was the subject of intense discussion in Norway, it was popular and frequently used abroad. The first year after his invention, the forceps was still not used at his own clinic, The Maternal-Foundation in Oslo. Despite Kielland working closely with Professor Brandt for more than 10 years, his invention never got a definite breakthrough in Norway. On the contrary, Brandt did not think it had any advantage over the one he already used. The Simpsons-forceps met all reasonable demands, he said, \\"so it has not been necessary to consider any other candidate.\\" He did not think there was much to learn from his former assistant physician. In a later edition of Brandt's textbook of obstetrics which was published in 1922, seven years after Kielland had first received international attention, the forceps was not even mentioned. Kielland's forceps were, as far as we know, not used in the Birth clinic, or the hospital until after Brandt's departure in 1930. Kielland was a member in good standing of Norwegian Medical Association.

The test is supported by more than 700 institutions including the California State University system. The test is available in more than 40 countries, and is also used by businesses, and governments such as Saudi Arabia, Colombia, and Mexico for large-scale initiatives. There are over 600 iTEP test centers worldwide, with more than 100 in China where iTEP has partnerships with some of the largest education companies in the country. iTEP International was co-founded by former ELS Language Centers President Perry Akins and business partner Sharif Ossayran. The test was first launched in 2008 for colleges, universities, and international programs. Versions for secondary schools and business use were soon added, followed by English tests for specific industries such as hospitality and au pair. Education Applications There are three iTEP exams for use in educational settings: iTEP Academic is used on-site by intensive English programs (IEPs) for placement, progress, and exit evaluation. It is also used by colleges and universities for admissions purposes. iTEP SLATE evaluates high school, secondary school, and middle school students, and is used by boarding schools and academies. Between June 2012 and June 2013, the number of US institutions recognizing this test quadrupled and the number continues to grow through 2017. This growth is largely due to the retirement of ETS's SLEP exam and the limited availability of their TOEFL Junior test. iTEP Placement is designed for the prompt turnaround of placement testing in English programs. It assesses grammar, listening, vocabulary, and reading in addition to writing prompts that can be graded by the administering institution. iTEP Academic and SLATE each have a \\"core\\" version and a \\"plus\\" version. The \\"core\\" versions are Internet-based, last 60 minutes, and test reading, grammar and listening. The \\"plus\\" versions last 90 minutes in total and also test writing and speaking, requiring the test taker to submit writing and speaking samples via computer. Results are available instantly on the multiple-choice \\"core\\" sections, and the speaking and writing results are graded by ESL-trained native English speakers in 5 business days (or 24 hours for IEPs). The \\"plus\\" exams retail for $119USD and can be scheduled within 3 days, making iTEP one of the most flexible and least expensive options among its competitors, which include TOEFL and IELTS. Institutions administering iTEP exams on-site receive discounted rates. iTEP also creates customized or white label tests for educational institutions. Business Applications iTEP offers general iTEP Business and iTEP Conversation exams, as well as specialized English exams for specific industries. iTEP Business measures the English skills needed for a work environment. It is used by companies to screen new hires, make decisions about promotions and assignments, and evaluate English training programs. Like iTEP Academic and iTEP SLATE, iTEP Business has a core and plus version. iTEP Conversation assesses an individual's ability to speak and understand English within 30 minutes. The exam is designed to put the test-taker at ease using a conversational, friendly context. This exam is also used in academic settings. iTEP Hospitality measures the English skills necessary to work at restaurants, hotels, resorts, and cruise lines that serve English speakers. The test lasts 30 minutes and evaluates speaking and listening. It is typically administered onsite by an employer for hiring and promotional decisions. iTEP Au Pair evaluates the English abilities of foreign applicants to au pair programs in the US. Like iTEP Hospitality, it assesses speaking and listening skills in 30 minutes using industry specific content. iTEP Intern is used by agencies that process J-1 visa applicants who wish to come from abroad to work as interns with US companies. This exam lasts 30 minutes and assesses listening and speaking skills using workplace contexts. Scoring iTEP scores individuals on a scale of 0-6 (at 0.5 intervals) for each section of the test as well as an overall score. Each level translates to CEFR levels and an equivalent range of scores on other language proficiency exams. Test Preparation In 2014, iTEP released the Official iTEP Preparation Guide, printing an updated edition in 2015. The Prep Guide consists of a 133-page printed book intended to familiarize test-takers with the format of the tests, and two practice tests, one to be taken before reading the book as a diagnostic, and another to be taken at the end as a comparison. The writing and speaking portions of the test are self-graded to help test-takers grasp the criteria that will be used to evaluate their work. The Prep Guide is sold online for about $27USD. An edition for the Chinese market was published by Beijing Foreign Studies University-based Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press in 2016 and retails for ¬•88.

It encompasses an area just west of downtown Nashua, roughly located along the southern bank of the Nashua River, bordered on the west side by Mine Falls Park, on the south side by the Nashua River canal, up to Ledge Street, and from the east side by Factory, Pine and Water streets, up to the Main Street bridge. . Today this area is dominated by the clock tower at \\"Clock Tower Place\\" apartments, and the large \\"Millyard\\" smokestack of the Picker building. The district takes its name from the time when this complex of buildings belonged to the Nashua Manufacturing Company, and though surrounding buildings also served the company in some way or another, they are not included in the district. The Nashua Manufacturing Company was originally built as a cotton mill and was incorporated in 1823. Their competitor, the Jackson Manufacturing Company, located downstream on the other side of the Main Street bridge at Jackson Falls dam, was incorporated in 1824. Nashua power canal Though all of Mine Falls Park is not a part of the district, the entirety of the Nashua River Canal is, up to and including the 1886 Mine Falls Gatehouse. This \\"Upper\\", or \\"Power canal\\" is long, deep and wide, and it was dug and in operation by 1830.

The creation of a new railroad line to Nashua from Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1838 gave the local economy a further boost, and the Nashua Iron Company opened, specializing in locomotive parts for this growing new industry.

In the 1980s, one of his great-grandsons began an effort to have a marker placed on Smith's grave. Because other bodies had been buried in the same location, cemetery officials would allow neither the grave to be marked nor Smith's remains to be moved. The dispute culminated in an October 2, 1985, ruling by the New York Supreme Court which ordered that Smith's body be disinterred for reburial in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. His remains were interred at Arlington on May 30, 1986, following services at Manhattan's St. James' Church, where Smith was married 116 years earlier, and a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial.

It is numbered 27 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site A fable for the empty-headed J.J.Grandville's illustration of La Fontaine's Fables, 1838 The fable is always briefly stated and seems chiefly the vehicle for a criticism of the good-looking but stupid upper class. A fox comes across a mask anciently used by actors; after an examination, it remarks, 'So full of beauty, so empty of brains!' The Latin version of this, generally shortened to caput vacuum cerebro, then became proverbial. It is recorded by Erasmus in his Adagia, along with its Greek equivalent (·ΩÆ Œø·º∑Œ± Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±Œª·Ω¥, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ ŒøœçŒ∫ ·ºîœáŒµŒπ), with the explanation that it originates from Aesop's fable.Desiderius Erasmus Adagiourum epitome, Amsterdam 1650, p.319 There are different versions of the story, sometimes involving a wolf contemplating the broken head of a statue.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable III, Leiden NL 2003, p.700 Its earliest English appearance is in William Caxton's collection of the fables (1484), under the title of \\"The wulf and the dede man‚Äôs hede‚Äù, as an example of the proposition that ‚ÄòMany one ben whiche haue grete worship and glorye but noo prudence‚Äô .Text on the Aesopica site But Andrea Alciato, the influential Italian originator of the emblem book, generally pictures a fox contemplating a mask. The six-line Latin poem accompanying it declares that it is mind, not outward form, that is most important (Mentem, non formam, plus pollere).Emblemata, emblem 189 This version also appeared in a Neo-Latin poem by Gabriele Faerno.Vulpes et Larva, Fable 66 The version in La Fontaine's Fables is told of a fox and a bust (IV.14). However, the fable is merely alluded to in his poem, which is more a meditation on appearance and comments at the end that the fox‚Äôs remark ‚Äòto many a lord applies‚Äô.An online translation When the caricaturist J.

She plays for the Norway women's national football team. Gj√∏en first came to national attention in December 2007 as a 15-year-old when she escaped with her life after being trapped by smoke and flames in a fire that destroyed her family home on the island of Sotra in the space of only a few minutes, by jumping from a third- floor window at a height of over seven metres. Her goalkeeper's instincts were said to have helped her to survive the fall with a relatively minor injury, a broken vertebra without nerve damage (no one else was injured). The press coverage was summarised in English.  Club Football  After making a full recovery she returned to top-level football a year later, as a junior keeper for Arna-Bj√∏rnar, and in December 2009 she joined LSK Kvinner FK in Oslo as the club's reserve keeper.LSK Kvinner player bio (in Norwegian) She made her Toppserien debut on June 12, 2010 against the Norwegian champions, R√∏a, and then went on to play every match for LSK Kvinner during 2011. In 2012, she moved back to Bergen as first-keeper for IL Sandviken, a club her family had been involved with for many years. With Gj√∏en as their keeper Sandviken finished the 2012 Toppserien season in sixth place, their best for many years. At the end of the season she announced she would spend the spring semester of 2013 at the University of Florida at Gainesville, from where she returned to play in the Toppserien for Kolbotn from 5 May until 15 June. At the end of 2013 Gj√∏en signed a contract to play for LSK Kvinner.  International Football  Gj√∏en was Norway's first-choice goalkeeper in the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup competition, held in Japan during August and September, 2012. She played in all Norway's matches. The team beat Canada and Argentina in the group stage but lost to North Korea, finishing in second place in the group. In the quarter-finals they were beaten by the eventual beaten finalists, Germany. From summer 2007 until 16 July 2012 Nora Gj√∏en played 27 matches in goal for Norway's international youth teams from Under-15 to Under-23. The four matches with the Under-20s in Japan in August referred to above bring the total to 31. In September 2012 Norway qualified for the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 by beating Belgium and Iceland, and the team produced a short video in which Gj√∏en rapped the story of the team's qualification campaign in Norwegian and English. Gj√∏en joined the Norwegian squad that travelled to Sweden to play in the Euros as the third goalkeeper, but she became the first reserve after the second keeper suffered an injury, and Gj√∏en sat on the bench as Norway's reserve goalkeeper in the final at Friends Arena, which Norway lost 1‚Äì0 to Germany.

It was released on 11 October 2012 through Roton and features Romanian trio Play & Win. The track was written by Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea, Marcel Botezan and Joddie Connor, while production was handled by the first three under the name of Play & Win. \\"Inndia\\" is an Arabic and oriental-influenced song encompassing guiar accords and male vocals which complement Inna. Critical response to \\"Inndia\\" was mixed, with one critic calling it passable, while another included it in their list of the best Inna songs. To promote the track, an accompanying music video was shot by Edward Aninaru and was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 19 September 2012. It shows the singer helping a stripper to escape from her aggressive boss in a club. Multiple reviewers noted the inclusion of lesbians in the visual and Inna's lascivious appearance. The singer also performed \\"Inndia\\" on various occasions. Commercially, it reached the top ten in Romania. Background and release \\"Inndia\\" was written by Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea, Marcel Botezan and Joddie Connor, while production was handled by the first three under the name of Play & Win. The trio was also credited as a featuring artist on the track. The song was made available for digital download on 11 October 2012 by Roton, featuring six remixes along with the original track. An accompanying artwork was unveiled in September 2012, with Alex from Romanian website Urban.ro noting that Inna looked \\"sexy and exotic\\" on the cover. Composition and reception An editor from Italian website RnB Junk wrote that \\"Inndia\\" was an \\"oriental-like\\" song, noting that its title coincided with its style. He further pointed out that the song featured elements not approached by the singer in previous material. Alin from Urban.ro similarly thought that the recording was of a new style compared to Inna's previous work, noting Arabic influences, guitar accords and male vocals complementing the singer. Reagan Gavin Rasquinh of The Times of India wrote, \\"despite the title, [the track] has nothing to do with the subcontinent, in case you were wondering.\\" According to Urban.ro, \\"Inndia\\" refers to the name of a woman who is portrayed in the music video. Upon its release, music critics met \\"Inndia\\" with mixed reviews. An editor of Pro FM listed the recording in their list of \\"16 hits with which Inna made history\\". The Times of India Gavin Rasquinh found \\"Inndia\\" was \\"another passable track with a thwacking snare sound\\". Commercially, the song reached number ten on Romania's Airplay 100 on 21 January 2012, becoming her ninth top ten hit in the country. Promotion An accompanying music video for \\"Inndia\\" was shot by Edward Aninaru, and was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 19 September 2012. It was preceded by a lyrics video released on 28 June 2012 on the same platform. The visual begins with shots of a woman smoking and female strippers pole dancing in a club. Inna enterers the building and sits down at the bar starting a conversation with the female bartender. Subsequently, the singer is seen pole dancing for a gentleman. Later in the video, she cares for a female stripper named \\"Inndia\\" with a scar on her face, who sits in a bathtub next to her. Inna also secretly watches how Inndia is beaten by her boss in another scene. Both manage to escape the respective room after Inna breaks a glass over the man's head. Subsequently, they enter the club where the singer pole dances in front of a huge crowd along with other females. \\"Inndia\\" is shortly seen sitting on a couch with two other women, who write the words \\"rock\\" and \\"party\\" on her skin with eyeliner. Cut scenes show Inna wearing black lingerie on a bed with a female dressed similarly. Reviewers were generally positive towards the music video. Fabien Eckert from 20 minutes wrote that it was appealing to the male audience, noting Inna's lascivious appearance. An editor from RnB Junk similarly said that the singer showed \\"her model physics\\" in the clip, and thought that \\"the clip will make the singer's [male] fans happy as the female audience can simply skip it\\". Edi of Urban.ro found that \\"Inndia\\" was Inna's sexiest and most explicit visual, further noting semi-nude dancers and Inna's portrayal of a lesbian. Echoing this thought, Spanish Lesbian- themed portal Lesbicanarios listed it at number three on their list the best music videos featuring lesbians. Inna performed the song in a stripped-down version in the backyard of her grandmother's house on 11 September 2012, followed by an appearance on Romanian radio station Kiss FM on 27 November. The singer also performed live on the roof of a building in Istanbul on 7 December as part of the singer's \\"Rock the Roof\\" series. Inna also sang the song at Alba Fest held in Alba Iulia, Romania, and at the World Trade Center Mexico City. In December 2018, Inna performed \\"Inndia\\" on O Ses T√ºrkiye.

It stars Rosie Day, Kevin Howarth and Sean Pertwee. Synopsis Angel is a young girl who is forced to work in a house that specializes in supplying kidnapped women forced into the sex trade to various military personnel. Initially planned to be put to work as an unwilling sex slave, Angel, a deaf mute with an \\"unattractive\\" birth mark on her face, instead becomes the assistant to Viktor, who runs the brothel. During the day she is given the duty of putting makeup on the kidnapped women and drugging them. After they have been violently raped by various men, Angel has the duty of cleaning them up. At night Angel wanders the walls and crawlspaces of the house, which is when she befriends newcomer Vanya who understands sign language. The squad that brought in Angel comes for a visit. The commander, Goran, brings his squad into the brothel, including his beloved brother, Josif, and another soldier, Ivan. Angel crawls through the vents from her room to Vanya's room and sees Vanya being raped by Ivan. When Ivan kills Vanya, Angel uses a knife to attack and kill him. The shuffling noises inside the room alert Goran, Viktor, and the rest of the squad who come to find Ivan and Vanya dead, with Angel gone. The rest of the men start looking for Angel. Goran sends one of his men into the vents, but Angel is able to outmaneuver and kill him. Viktor kills one of Goran's men because he has been losing so many women from the brutal rapes. Angel escapes the house and runs into a nearby forest. As Goran, Josif and Viktor start looking for her, Angel sees all the dead women decomposing in the forest. Viktor catches up to Angel and convinces her that he isn't going to harm her, and she gives up the knife. Viktor, being caught by Goran and Josif, offers Angel in exchange for their mercy. The three men are at a standstill with their weapons drawn with Viktor using Angel as a human shield. Viktor convinces Goran and Josif to call a truce by offering half of his profits. As the men slowly put down their weapons, Angel grabs the knife from Viktor's belt and stabs him in the foot causing him to inadvertently shoot Josif. Goran is enraged and shoots Viktor. Josif then dies and Goran kills Viktor by shooting him several times. Angel escapes to a woman's house, but soon realizes the woman is Ivan's wife, Lexi. After Lexi gets a call from Goran and hears the tragic news of Josif, she unsuccessfully attempts to kill Angel. Angel kills her and starts running to the nearest factory. Goran catches up and they start climbing the tubes. When Goran gets stuck, Angel stuffs his mouth with a rag so he would be unable to speak or call for help. Angel proceeds out of the tube leaving Goran behind to suffocate. Finally free, Angel runs to the nearest house and is helped by an elderly couple. It is the doctor's house which Viktor calls for help regarding his girls.

Stuart Bailey and Paul Blackwell appear in uncredited cameos. Reception The film received mixed reviews. It currently holds a 21% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, garnered from 14 reviews. Empire called it, \\"Strikingly bold and brutally compelling. It also handles its delicate subject more carefully than you might imagine from a brief synopsis\\". Starburst Magazine said: \\"The film is just powerful and gut- churning enough to leave a lasting impression and one of the strongest directorial debuts of recent times. Boasting a remarkable performance from young Rosie Day, the film is very different from your typical British genre picture and is a refreshing change from endless zombie films or movies about hooded violent teenagers\\". Dreadcentral said \\"Hyett‚Äôs direction is measured, confident, and darkly poetic throughout, weaving an emotional web of tenderness amidst hopelessness and abuse. The Seasoning House is a lyrical, bleak, and deeply wounding exploration of brutality and inhumanity that cries out to be seen\\". Bloody Disgusting wrote that \\"What makes The Seasoning House stand out is that everything about it is simple and done in a way that just results in the proper definition of art\\". Time Out London criticized what they saw as a \\"failure to blend the raw sexual violence and social comment with more familiar generic tropes\\" and the \\"downbeat switchback ending\\" that they felt was \\"neither convincing nor earned.\\". The Guardian also panned the film, as they felt that the depictions of human monsters were \\"cardboard\\" and did not feel genuine.

He is also currently the chair of the Board of Regents of the University of California.\\"New chair of the UC Board of Regents elected\\" He is a principal co-author of the Los Angeles City Charter (the city's constitution), adopted in 1999, and the author of The Strategy of Meetings (c. 1988, Simon and Schuster). Two-time chair of the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, in 2000 and 2010 he was named one of the most influential lawyers in California by the Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journals. The Los Angeles Business Journal named Kieffer among the leaders in its August 2016 inaugural edition of \\"The Los Angeles 500: The Most Influential People in Los Angeles\\". Life and career Born in New York City, New York, Kieffer was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and graduated from Serra High School in San Mateo, California. He received a B.A. in history from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1969, where he was named the Outstanding Male Graduate upon graduation. He served one year as legislative assistant to Congressman Michael J. Harrington and received a J.D. from UCLA in 1973. During his third year he clerked for Honorable David Bazelon, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. He joined the law firm of Manatt, Phelps & Rothenberg in 1973 (now Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP). In 1976, he became general counsel for the Presidential Campaign of Jerry Brown. In 1980, then Governor Jerry Brown appointed Kieffer to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, where he served as Chair from 1983 to 1985. He subsequently served on the Blue Ribbon Commission to review the California Master Plan for Higher Education. He served as Chair of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions from 1985-1987. In 1996, then Los Angeles City Attorney James Hahn appointed Kieffer to the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission, charged with rewriting the Los Angeles City Charter. Kieffer was subsequently elected chair of the commission. The story of the drafting and voter adoption of the new city charter is recounted in The City at Stake: Succession, Reform, and the Battle for Los Angeles by Professor Raphael J. Sonenshein (). In 1999, Kieffer was awardedhttp://www.legalty.com/en/description/4/24521/publisher=legalty.com the Social Responsibility Award by the Los Angeles Urban League. Following the events of 9/11, then Mayor Hahn asked Kieffer to head the Economic Impact Task Force charged with recommending steps to minimize the economic effects of 9/11 on business in Los Angeles; the report became the blueprint for City Council and Mayoral response. In 2003 Kieffer was selected as the Chairman of the Board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and served two terms in that position. Kieffer expanded the board to include as ex officio members the leaders of previously underrepresented ethnic organizations as well as competing business organizations and recruited other significant civic and business leaders to the board of directors. In 2003, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce was the only business organization in the state to oppose the recall of Governor Gray Davis one year after his re-election on the principled ground that it was a misuse of the recall process. During the California governorships of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, Kieffer was president of the Governor's Residence Foundation, a private non-profit which pays for the governor's housing in Sacramento. In 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger appointed Kieffer to the Board of Regents of the University of California with a term that runs to March, 2021. On March 14, 2018, student and labor activists accused Kieffer of conflicts of interest at a University of California Board of Regents meeting. They noted that Kieffer voted for a policy change incentivizing employees to opt-out of the traditional UC retirement system in favor of UC's 403(b) program administered by Fidelity Investments, even though Fidelity was a client of Kieffer's law firm. They also noted Kieffer voted in favor of a controversial new payroll system developed by Oracle, another client. Kieffer responded that although Regents voted on the changes, they did not vote on the vendor contracts. Kieffer is the author of The Strategy of Meetings (c. 1988 Simon and Schuster). He was contributing author to Governing Public Colleges and Universities (c. 1993 Jossey-Bass). Kieffer continues to practice law at the Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP law firm office in Los Angeles with a particular emphasis on state and municipal regulatory work. Life as Composer Throughout his professional and civic career Kieffer has composed music, first as a young singer-songwriter, but subsequently including film and television music. His composition, \\"Arlington\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLql5xoM3yY, debuted in 2014 with the Gulf Coast Symphony Orchestra. In 2015 he added lyrics and the piece was released on YouTube with the lyrics sung by the Los Angeles Master Chorale. His \\"Fanfare For The Special Olympics\\" debuted with the Special Olympics in 2015. Recently his piano pieces have been performed in multiple Chinese cities by Russian pianist Angela Cholakyan.

The alleged incident occurred in 2014 during a meeting with student leaders at which Kieffer purchased alcohol for students. This was the second known accusation against a UC regent, following the resignation of Norman Pattiz under pressure from student groups and fellow regents in 2017 after having been accused of making sexually inappropriate comments.. On June 8, 2020, the University of California has cleared Regent George Kieffer of allegations of sexual misconduct, finding insufficient evidence to support a graduate student‚Äôs claim.

He then worked at St James‚Äô Hospital Leeds, before professional training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Leeds. Career He then worked in the National Health Service as a Clinical Psychologist before taking a job as a junior lecturer at the University of Liverpool, where he registered for a Ph.D. supervised by Richard Bentall. Soon after being awarded his doctorate, he moved to the University of Manchester, and then later returned to the University of Liverpool, where he became professor of Clinical Psychology. Research interests, publications and courses His research interests are in psychological processes underpinning well-being and mental health, and in particular psychotic phenomena such as delusions and hallucinations. In 2014 he launched a free, online, open-access course exploring our understanding of mental health and well-being. Kinderman has published widely on the role of psychological factors as mediators between biological, social and circumstantial factors in mental health and well-being. In his 2019 book, A Manifesto for Mental Health: Why We Need a Revolution in Mental Health Care, he critically examines the dominant ‚Äòdisease-model‚Äô of mental health care and offers a contemporary, biopsychosocial, alternative. He highlights evidence that our mental health and wellbeing depend largely on the society in which we live, on the things happen to us, and on how we learn to make sense of and respond to those events. He is also interested in the application of such psychological science to public policy. Roles and awards In 2000, he received the British Psychological Society's Division of Clinical Psychology's 'May Davidson Award', an annual award for outstanding contributions to the field of clinical psychology, in the first ten years after qualifying. He served the British Psychological Society as President (2016-2017) and twice as elected Chair of the Society's Division of Clinical Psychology; from 2004 to 2005, and again from 2010‚Äì2011. In that role, he worked with the UK Department of Health, the BBC, the Health Professions Council, the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency and the UK Office for National Statistics, amongst others. In 2017, he resigned from being Vice-President of the British Psychological Society, citing the formation of the Association of Clinical Psychologists (UK) as a trigger, Kinderman is a member of the Council for Evidence Based Psychiatry, and a trustee of the Joanna Simpson Foundation,.

Werbner (born July 14, 1937) is an American anthropologist who specializes in the Zimbabwe and Botswana region, including ritual, personal and historical narrative, politics, law, regional analysis. He has taught at the University of Manchester since 1961. Biography Professor Richard Werbner was born in Boston, Massachusetts. The precise date is a matter of some controversy. He studied at Brandeis University, conducting fieldwork among the Winnebago of Nebraska in 1958 and graduating with a BA in 1959. He obtained a Fulbright Scholarship in 1959, through which he was able to go to the United Kingdom to study at Manchester University. He began field studies in southern Africa in 1960 among the Kalanga people, first in Zimbabwe and later in Botswana, and then among the Tswapong people in Botswana. In 1961 he was appointed a research assistant at Manchester University. In 1968 he obtained a PhD from Manchester University. He married and is the father of two children. His wife Pnina Werbner, also a professor of anthropology, is the niece of Max Gluckman, a South African anthropologist who did important work in Barotseland and was a leading figure at the Manchester school. After Gluckman died in 1975, Werbner assumed the role of continuing his legacy at the Manchester school. He has taught as a visitor at the Catholic University of Leuven, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the University of California, Berkeley, the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., the University of Bergen, the University of California, San Diego, Macquarie University, Sydney, the Australian National University, Canberra, the University of Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Czech Republic and the University of Botswana, Gaborone. As of 2012 Werbner was Professor Emeritus in African Anthropology, Honorary Research Professor in Visual Anthropology, and Director of the International Centre for Contemporary Cultural Research at Manchester University. Reception Werbner won the Amaury Talbot Prize of the Royal Anthropological Institute for his 1991 book Tears of the Dead: The Social Biography of an African Family. Mieka Ritsema, writing of Werbner's Reasonable Radicals and Citizenship in Botswana: The Public Anthropology of Kalanga Elites in the African Studies Review, described it as \\"a fascinating account of the state-making practices of elites, and especially minority elites, in Botswana... Werbner composes a powerful narrative, rich in documentation and insight developed from more than forty years of commitment to Botswana.\\" Ritsema called the book a \\"seminal work of engaged retrospection.\\" Bibliography  Films Werbner directed a series of documentary films under the overall title The Well Being Quest in Botswana, which were published by the University of Manchester. * 2004 Seance Reflections with Richard Werbner (45 minute documentary) * 2006 Shade Seekers and the Mixer (60-minute documentary) * 2008 Encountering Eloyi (56-minute documentary) * 2009 Holy Hustlers (53-minute documentary) Seance Reflections documents a childless couple who try to recover their well-being by consulting a charismatic diviner and healer in the village of Moremi. Later they review and discuss the film of their seances. In Shade Seekers and the Mixer, the elders of a village, including a controversial healer, view and discuss an earlier film of the healer's s√©ances with a former patient who is now Werber's research assistant.

Although some mill ponds served this purpose for water powered sawmills, steam-powered sawmills used log ponds for transportation of logs near the mill; and did not require the elevation drop of watermill reservoirs. Log being hoisted from a log pond into the sawmill. Splash of logs being dumped into a log pond. Background The earliest mechanized sawmills of the industrial revolution were built on navigable rivers, lakes, or estuaries where logs could be floated to the sawmill and lumber could be carried to markets aboard ships or barges. Early steam sawmills included a hoist to lift logs out of the water onto a carriage which moved the log past a stationary powered saw. Men could relatively easily push floating logs into position to be lifted by the hoist. Forests distant from navigable water became accessible with the development of railroads. Sawmills adjacent to navigable waters were termed cargo mills, in contrast to interior rail mills relying upon railroad transportation of logs and lumber. Until tractors powered by internal combustion engines were powerful enough to move logs, ponds were required to simplify movement of logs from storage to the sawmill hoist. Storage of logs in water has the additional advantages of minimizing fire risks, washing away dirt which could dull saws, and preventing splitting of logs which might otherwise dry prior to milling. Cargo mills typically used a system of floating log booms to contain stored logs from delivery until milling.Oakleaf pp.8,12&17 Log pond operation Rail mills were built adjacent to small ponds when possible, but log ponds were often constructed by building a dam on a small stream where no suitable natural pond was available. Risks of periodic flood damage discouraged use of larger rivers for log ponds, but water might be diverted or pumped from a larger river to maintain water levels in an adjacent log pond.Oakleaf pp.12&17 A railway spur would be built to a where logs might be rolled or hoisted off flat cars into the pond.Carranco pp.120&171 Log ponds were constructed with surface area allowing floating storage of the inventory of logs required to maintain sawmill production through periods when logging or rail deliveries might be interrupted.Oakleaf p.8 Log ponds are convenient water reservoirs for firefighting at sawmills; and for routine cooling and lubrication of saw blades and other mill machinery. Stormwater runoff from the mill yard and wastewater generated within the sawmill often flow into the log pond as the lowest point adjacent to the sawmill. Boiler blowdown, lumber drying kiln condensate, and exhaust steam from sawmill machinery sometimes kept a log pond from freezing during cold weather.Oakleaf pp.10,12&17 Environmental considerations Log ponds are convenient reservoirs for water recycling in applications including hydraulic debarkers or dust suppression. Log ponds offer some wastewater treatment similar to a settling basin and facultative lagoon. Log pond overflow during rainfall and snowmelt may contain floating pieces of wood and bark, dissolved organic compounds leached from wood, and suspended particles of sawdust and soil. The United States Environmental Protection Agency published wet storage category effluent limitations in the 1970s prohibiting discharge of floating woody debris and requiring log pond overflow pH to be between 6 and 9.40CFR429.100 Accessed 2012-09-17 Sources * Carranco, Lynwood Redwood Lumber Industry Golden West Books, San Marino, California (1982) * Oakleaf, H.B.

The first, in September 13, was a national protest against the policies of the president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. The protests generated significant repercussions in local politics. The second, on November 8 (known as 8N), was another much more massive protest in several cities in Argentina, including Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, Olivos, among many others throughout Greater Buenos Aires and other regions. There were also protests in Argentine embassies and consulates in cities such as New York, Miami, Madrid, Sydney, Bogot√°, Santiago and Barcelona, among others. Its complaints were almost the same, but the difference in size was very big. The protests are considered not only a call to Kirchnerism, but also to the opposition, because they do not have a strong leader. Antecedents Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was re-elected in 2011, by 54% of the vote in a general election. After it, the government instituted a period of fiscal austerity which has severely impacted the economy. Inflation increased to more than 25% annually, but the income tax was not adjusted accordingly, which led to a demonstration by unionist Hugo Moyano. The government imposed arbitrary trade barriers and forbade the acquisition of foreign currency, generating a black market in it. As the government denies the inflation through the manipulation of the INDEC statistics, huge amounts of $100 banknotes, the largest denomination in circulation, were printed, instead of creating a banknote of a higher value. This renewed the Boudougate, a political controversy involving the vice president Amado Boudou and the printing house appointed to print the banknotes. At the political level, President Kirchner is not allowed to run for a new mandate in 2015 and the Front for Victory has no other likely candidates, instead promoting an amendment to the Constitution of Argentina to allow indefinite reelections. This proposal is resisted by all the other political parties. Relations between Kirchnerism and the press worsened, with several attacks to the newspapers not aligned with the government. President Kirchner had also said to her cabinet that \\"you should be afraid of God, and a bit afraid of me\\", which was not well received either. The 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the crime levels and the lack of respect for republican institutions were also invoked as causes for the protest. The event The demonstration was called for September 13 at 20:00. It was organized through social networks, without the intervention of political parties. Many people were already present at the intersection of Santa Fe and Callao Streets in Buenos Aires at 19:30, and most of them gathered at Plaza de Mayo at 21:00. The main crowd eventually numbered almost 200,000 people. Hundreds of people protested at the Quinta de Olivos, the official residence of the president, even though Kirchner was not present at the time. Similar protests took place in other cities of Argentina, next to their important places. Twenty thousand people in C√≥rdoba gathered next to the Patio Olmos, increasing the number of previous demonstrations. In Rosario the people protested next to the National Flag Memorial. The Civic Center of San Carlos de Bariloche and the intersection of San Mart√≠n and Sarmiento in Mendoza attracted the local protesters. Posadas, with 2,000 protesters, had the first notable demonstration against the Kirchners. Salta had a demonstration of nearly 1,000 protesters. =Repercussions= Media Nearly 80% of the Argentine media at the time were controlled by the government (directly in the cases of state-owned media, or indirectly in the cases of media which publish advertising paid by the government).Argentina: Editors Call For A Global Protest As Government Attacks Independent Press The official media refused to broadcast the protest at 20:00, some of then began to do it at 22:00. The Televisi√≥n P√∫blica () TV channel broadcast a documentary film, and C5N filmed streets with few people. Todo Noticias, which is not aligned with the government, broadcast the protest the whole night, with a notable boost in the points of rating. Politics Government politicians disparaged the protest, minimizing its significance, and the president said that she would not get nervous about it. Mayor Mauricio Macri requested her to acknowledge the protest and listen to the people's demands.

The framework of this agreement was a 15 May 2009, in a joint press statement of President Nicolas Sarkozy and President Asif Ali Zardari, under which France agreed to provide assistance to improve the nuclear safety of its nuclear power installations and related civilian nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and,as well as the transfer full civilian-based nuclear technology to Pakistan. In contrast to Indo-American nuclear agreement, this framework restricted itself to only to co-operate in the field of \\"nuclear safety\\", as quoted by the French Foreign Ministry. While foreign service officers and the Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi outlined what they termed as \\"significant development\\"; however, a French official stated that his nation has \\"no intention\\" of pursuing a civilian nuclear trade deal, roughly equivalent to Indo-US deal, with Pakistan. Overview and background Since 1967, France has emerged as the biggest defence contractor of Pakistan, despite its good and relatively close relations with India. Pakistan is one of three original participant states (others being India and Israel) that refused to be signatory of the NPT.See: Nuclear Proliferation Treaty On March 1976, France and Pakistan signed a mutual agreement for the supply of plutonium- based nuclear reprocessing plant at the Chasma. However, this deal came under attack from various countries, particularly the United States, for two reasons. First, Pakistan under Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was putting efforts to gain success in its atomic bomb project. Second, the French deal was not completely under the inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States pressed full scope and built momentum on France to re-consider its decision, while on other hand, Bhutto threatened the France that the future contracts would be contingent on its first fulfilling the \\"contractual obligation\\" to the legally obliged agreement. In 1976, Henry Kissinger arrived Pakistan with tough message which became publicly known in Pakistan. In a short span of time, France under pressured by the various countries, cancelled the project with Pakistan. Clauses and scope Despite France's willingness to give a green signal for this agreement, the confusion remains over what was agreed. The officials of Pakistan's Foreign ministry had undertaken to supply Pakistan with \\"civilian nuclear technology\\", the French officials stressed on the fact that \\"France had agreed only to co-operate in the field of \\"nuclear safety\\". Although, in an official press French President Nicolas Sarkozy marked to his counterpart that \\"France wanted Pakistan to have a wide-ranging deal to buy nuclear equipment\\" like the one obtained by its rival India, but later spokesman for the French presidency was careful to rein in expectations and much of the details were closed to the public.

The Election Commissioners are usually retired IAS or IRS officers. Until 1989, the commission was a single member body, but later two additional Election Commissioners were added. Thus, the Election Commission currently consists of a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners. The decisions of the commission are taken by a majority vote. Sunil Arora is the current 23rd Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners are Rajiv Kumar and Sushil Chandra.  History  Originally in 1950, the commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. Two additional Commissioners were appointed to the commission for the first time on 16 October 1989 but they had a very short tenure, ending on 1 January 1990. The Election Commissioner Amendment Act, 1989 made the Commission a multi-member body. The concept of a 3-member Commission has been in operation since then, with the decisions being made by a majority vote. the official website was introduced on 28 February 1998  Removal  The Chief Election Commissioner cannot be removed from his post easily on account of any political reasons. This is necessary so as to preserve the independence of election commission. Chief Election Commissioner of India can be removed from his office by the President on the basis of a resolution passed to that effect by both the houses of parliament with a two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity. Other Election Commissioners can be removed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. A Chief Election Commissioner has never been removed in India. In 2009, just before the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections, Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami sent a recommendation to President Prathibha Patil to remove Election Commissioner Navin Chawla, who was soon to take office as the Chief Election Commissioner and to subsequently supervise the Lok Sabha Election, citing his partisan behavior in favor of one political party. The President opined that such a recommendation is not binding on the President, and hence rejected it. Subsequently, after Gopalswami's retirement the next month, Chawla became the Chief Election Commissioner and supervised the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections.  Compensation  The Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners who are usually retired IAS officers draw salaries and allowances at par with those of the Judges of the Supreme Court of India as per the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1992.

He is well known for his eclectic and flamboyant lyrics. Biography =Early life and career= He was born to parents Charmaine Bowen and Renford Nicholson in Manchester, Jamaica. Nicholson grew up in Manchester, where he attended the Kayda Primary School and later on moved to Kingston in the garrison of Water House, and continued his education Drew's Avenue All Age School; where he started singing at school concerts. At the age of 15, he moved to the coastal city of Portmore in southern Jamaica and where he furthered his schooling at the Waterford Comprehensive High School. While attending school, he and his pairs would hold their own concerts during the lunch break beating rhythms on the desk and carrying out deejay battles with each other. Music is inherently rooted in the Nicholson's family bloodline. He is the nephew of well-known singer Derrick Parker, who is famous throughout Jamaica for hits such as \\"Dem Nuh loyal No More\\", \\" Bus Mi Appeal\\", \\"How Long\\", and \\"Jah Never Fail Wi yet\\". =2000s= While growing up in Portmore, Merchant encountered the musical influences and mentorship from artists such as Busy Signal, Bounty Killer, Konshens, Mad- Cobra, Mavado, Frisco-kid, Singer J and Indica. In 2004, he was encouraged by Indica to enter the B-mobile star search talent competition in Portmore at Ken's Wild flower Lounge and was placed first runner up to roots reggae phenom Gyptian, known worldwide for such hits as \\"Hold yuh\\", \\"Nah Let Go\\", \\"Serious Times\\", \\"Mama\\", \\"Beautiful lady\\", and \\"She's My Lady\\". In that same year, Merchant performed at his first major event ‚Äì \\"The West Kingston Jamboree\\",Bridge, Jaide (3 December 2007). \\"ALL ROADS Led to West Kingston Jamboree on Sunday Night\\". Yardflex.com. Retrieved 15 September 2012. where world class dancehall and reggae talents such as Beenie Man, Vybz Kartel, and Mavado are regulars. His debut at this event was a major success; It resulted in him becoming a recording artist. Early on, Merchant currently boasted hit singles such as \\"Rise Up Mi People\\", \\"Badness Nuh Pay\\" and \\"Dance the Time Away\\" which were released in 2011.However, In December 2012, Merchant, went to war to prove himself and released \\"Move Out Mi tings\\" from his artillery which reviewed rave reviewsand ignited a family feud.The inspiration for this song was the then existing conflict between Merchant and his baby's mother.The accompanying music video for the song \\"Move Out Mi Things\\" exploded with overwhelming popularity and received heavy rotations on CVM HD, Swag TV, Links TV, TVJ and Hype TV, leading to multiple press features.Since then, he has collaborated with his uncle, Derrick Parker, on \\"Why Did You Have to Go Away,\\" and with Beenie Man's brother, Kirk Davis, on \\"Love a Bubble Up\\", and \\"Freedom Fighter\\". His singles, \\"Bun A Fire\\", \\"Freedom Fighter\\", and \\"I Wish\\" were released on the NVUS Records(NVUS Label) in May 2015. Merchant's next move in the music industry is to revolutionize the stagnant undercurrent that the international music industry is caught in. He wants to invade Cash Money Records and Young Money to add to their musical flavors. Merchant is now aiming to work with the likes of \\"Iggy Azalea\\", \\"Miley Cyrus\\", \\"Lil' Wayne,\\" \\"Nicki Minaj,\\" Rick Ross,\\" \\"DJ Khaled\\" or even his old school idols \\"Tony Bennett\\" and \\"Dolly Parton.\\" Controversy =Family Feud= On 3 October 2000, the rap duo, Outkast, released the song \\"Miss Jackson.\\" The song revolves around Andre Benjamin's tumultuous relationship with Erykah Badu and her mother. Merchant's \\"Move Out Mi Tings\\" parallels the Outkast song in that he airs the dirty laundry of his personal relationship with his baby's mother. The relationship with that lady went sour when Merchant was doing some overseas business in the Bahamas and his live-in girlfriend was having a relationship with a neighbor. According to Merchant, she sold his personal belongings (moving out with items such as furniture and appliances) and left Jamaica for Barbados. Instead of resorting to violence, Merchant decided to use his lyrical penmanship, and in two days, his masterpiece was completed. When asked about his inspiration for writing the song, Merchant described it as a knee-jerk reaction. He explained: \\"Because mi very hurt still. She no tell mi seh she move dem. She just do it. When mi come wid mi suitcase, only me and di suitcase inna di house. So instead of we having a physical war, mi just write di song. So if di song buss, mi can move in back some tings. Probably a my luck.\\" The song was highly controversial and made enemies as well as new fans for the embattled Merchant. When Publicist Karla Ashley (from Island Fuse Entertainment) interviewed Merchant‚Äôs baby mother, she was not in agreement with Merchant‚Äôs recount of events in the song and did not like the fact that their personal relation was aired in public. She explained: \\"I don't really like the song. I don't think it was truthful. I don't think he should have put it in the public. It needed more information so people would know exactly what took place. It was our private life so it should not have gone public\\".Nevertheless, motivated by the success of his former reality premised song, Merchant released another single entitled \\"Joe Grind\\" (a real life recount of one of his friend‚Äôs woman‚Äôs infidelity that employs a humorous undertone) Discography * \\" Rock Wid A Lady\\" (2010) * \\" Dance the Time Away\\" (2011) * \\" Badness Nuh Pay\\" (2011) * \\" Rise Up Mi People\\" (2011) * \\" Broke Out\\" (2011) * \\" Wicked So\\" (2012) * \\" Nah Trust Friends\\" (2012) * \\" Jah Is by My Side\\" (2012) * \\" Hard Way\\" (2012) * \\" I Don't Want To Live This Way\\" (2012) * \\" I don't Want To Live This Way\\" (2012) * \\" Safe Sex \\" (2013) * \\" Jingle Bell\\" (2013) * \\" Joe Grind\\" (2013) * \\" Summer Time featuring Spugy B\\" (2013) * \\" Bubble Up featuring Kirk Davis\\" (2013) * \\" Dem Nuh Wah Wi Rise featuring Spugy B\\" (2013) * \\" Better Must Come One Day\\" (2013) * \\" Never Walk Away \\" (2013) * \\" Gud Gud Gud \\" (2013) * \\" Pum Pum Gud \\" (2013) * \\" Mr. Bad Mine \\" (2013) * \\" Party & Love Me Self \\" (2013) * \\" Come on Lets Dance Me\\" (2013) * \\" When Jah Rain \\"(2013) * \\" Everything\\" (2015) * \\" Everything Yuh Get featuring Gud Gyal\\" (2015) * \\" Property Fi lock\\" (2015) * \\" Woman A Mi life\\" (2015) * \\" Bun A Fire\\" (2015) * \\" Freedom Fighter\\" (2015) * \\" I Wish \\" (2015) References External links *Merchant on Twitter *Merchant on Facebook *Merchant on Googleplus *Merchant on Instagram *Merchant on SoundCloud *Merchant on Myspace * Merchant‚Äôs Blog 1981 births Jamaican reggae musicians Living people People from Saint Catherine Parish ","title":"Merchant (reggae artist)"},{"id":"37044206","text":"The Fort Atkinson Water Tower is an unused water tower that was built in 1901 in Ft.

Career Adolf von Harnack, Otto Pfleiderer, and Wilhelm Dilthey supervised Beth's studies at the University of Berlin, where he earned a doctorate in 1898 for his dissertation Die Grundanschauungen Schleiermachers in seinem ersten Entwurf der philosophischen Sittenlehre. Beth became an instructor of systematic theology at the university in 1901. Shortly afterwards, he toured Christian communities in the Greek and Turkish parts of the Mediterranean, where he gathered material for his book Die orientalische Christenheit der Mittelmeerlander. Published in 1902, this book helped Western Protestants gain a better understanding of Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1906, Beth moved to the Protestant Theological Faculty at the University of Vienna,. and in the same year married Marianne Weisl. He was promoted to a full professorship in Vienna in 1908. He taught systematic theology and, partly influenced by Johannes Reinke and Carl N√§geli proposed a Neo-vitalist view. He partly accepted the idea of evolution as biological change, but at the same time, he criticized the idea of a driving process of natural selection for it suggested chance instead of \\"direct divine intervention.\\" Recalling the limitis of science, Beth insisted that religious experience should not be interpreted out of context, and that science and religion should co-exist together.Uljana Feest (2009). Historical Perspectives on Erkl√§ren and Verstehen. Springer, pp. 52-53 In 1922, Beth was one of the parties involved in the foundation of the Research Institute for the Psychology of Religion in Vienna. He also served as the editor of Zeitschrift fur Religionspsychologie from 1927 to 1938. He wrote the main article on \\"Orthodox-anatolische Kirche\\" and several related articles for the second edition of Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, published between 1929 and 1932. By 1938, Beth was the Dean of Faculty at the University of Vienna.. After the 1938 Anschluss in which Germany annexed Austria, Beth's wife Marianne (a lawyer from a Jewish family who had converted to Christianity on marrying) was unable to continue practicing law.Marianne Beth 1890-1984 (in German), Knowledge Base Erwachsenen Bildung.

Synopsis  The two men bear the same name (undisclosed throughout the story, but said to start with the letter \\"V\\") and are referred to as \\"Senior\\" and \\"Junior\\", although their ages are only 17 days apart. They live next door to each other in apartments with adjacent verandas. In spite of their parallel names, ages, life seasons and retirement situations, the two men serve as foils for one another. Senior has lived a life full of rich experiences, stimulating discussions, and vibrant family. However, the richness of his youth leads him to discount life under his present old-age conditions, and he finds himself constantly bitter and dissatisfied, longing for seasons gone by. Rude to those around him and pessimistic in most things, Senior is generally disagreeable, but his deep and loyal affection for Junior (although not often expressed) remains an endearing and redeeming quality throughout the story. Junior, meanwhile, has had a far less eventful life, characterized by mediocrity and never quite lived to its fullest. He had had an underwhelming career, never married, and never devoted himself to particularly passionate pursuits. Thus, while he is not \\"waiting to die\\" as Senior is, he is instead \\"still waiting to live.\\" Nonetheless, Junior remains quite happy and optimistic about life, despite being disappointed in his own. The story describes Senior and Junior as they go about their days, making the thirty-minute trek each week to cash in their pension checks and sitting on their verandas bickering back and forth. One day, Junior is hit by some girls on a Vespa and is struck down and instantly killed. Senior mourns his death deeply, wishing it were he instead. As more deaths strike the area due to a large tsunami, Senior laments that Death would take so many and yet leave him, who barely desires his meaningless life. Ultimately, he realizes that \\"death and life are just adjacent verdanas.\\" In all of this, Rushdie explores two contrasting approaches to life and death, exhibiting both in their pains and joys, merits and shortcomings. Although opposing in their plights‚Äî Junior plagued by death, and Senior by life, Junior by a past unlived and Senior by a past that can never be lived up to‚Äî both men grapple with the same common themes of the human experience, coming together to show the double edge sword that is old-age survival, memory, and the passing of time.

It follows the story of Sebastian Barnack, a young poet, who holidays with his hedonistic uncle in Florence. Many of the philosophical themes discussed in the novel are explored further in Huxley's 1945 work, The Perennial Philosophy. Title Time Must Have A Stop's title derives from Hotspur's death speech in William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 Act V, Scene 4: 'But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool; And time, that takes survey of all the world, Must have a stop' Plot summary The story initially follows Sebastian Barnack, a seventeen-year-old poet with the beauty of a della Robbia angel, and his desire to procure formal wear for a friend's party despite the wishes of his father John, an anti-fascist lawyer and socialist politician, who believes his son shouldn't live a decadent lifestyle while others suffer. Sebastian, in turn, believes his father's treatment of him comes from his strong physical resemblance to his late mother. Sebastian's mission takes him to holiday with his rich uncle Eustace, a hedonistic and highly indulgent man who has a great fondness for his young nephew. While staying with his uncle, Sebastian‚Äîa virgin‚Äîembarks upon a love affair with Veronica Thwale, a widow who closely resembles Mary Esdaile, a character of his own imagination that he tells tales to his friends about. Eustace agrees to buy his nephew formal wear and even bestows a painting by Degas upon him. Sebastian has an intense sexual encounter with Mrs. Thwale, and he feels the holiday has been an unmitigated success. However, before the weight of Eustace's generosity can be felt he dies of a heart attack, leaving Sebastian in a deep panic about the future of his outfit. Sebastian steals the painting to sell to fund his tuxedo but an auditor of the late uncle's estate notes the missing Degas and accusations of theft against innocent employees multiply. Sebastian remains silent, while others are accused and suffer. Finally, he knows he must get the Degas back. Unable to do so himself, he enlists the help of his father's cousin Bruno, a deeply religious bookshop owner. Meanwhile, the spirit of Eustace, an atheist, lives on and is used as both a narrative tool to allow Huxley to show the fate of characters across time and distance but also adds a hint of comic irony when Eustace's eccentric mother-in-law Mrs. Gamble hosts a seance to talk to her dead son-in-law but the second-rate medium involved garbles his message to Sebastian. Bruno is able to retrieve the painting but at great cost - calling on friends that inadvertently make himself an enemy of the Italian Fascisti. The Fascist police imprison and mistreat Bruno, and hasten his declining health. Sebastian, driven by his guilt, undertakes the care of his dying uncle and while doing so is altered by the old man's sureness and spirituality. Bruno effects a transformation in Sebastian and, rather than adopting Eustace's hedonism, the young poet seeks a more religious outlook. In the epilogue, set in the midst of the Second World War, Sebastian, who has lost a hand in combat, begins writing a comparative work of the world's religions, inspired by Bruno, that echoes Huxley's own Perennial Philosophy. His father, while not enamoured by his son's new approach to life, finally shows him respect. Themes Focusing on the spiritual health of the characters, Huxley explores many of the themes from his comparative study of mysticism, The Perennial Philosophy. The spuriousness of Mrs. Gamble's spiritualism, the limitations of Eustace's hedonism, and the paradox of Sebastian's weakness as a man and power as a creative artist are all contrasted with Bruno, whose spiritual contentment and non-attachment are presented by Huxley as the highest level of personal development. The book is laden with cultural and philosophical discussions amongst his characters with Huxley himself describing the work as his most successful attempt at \\"fusing idea with story\\". Characters *Sebastian Barnack - A 17-year-old poet, who bears an uncommon physical beauty and precociousness in verse but has the tiresome manner of a spoilt child. *Eustace Barnack - Sebastian's uncle, a gluttonous expatriate residing in Florence with a penchant for cigars and brandy. *John Barnack - Sebastian's father, a staunch anti-fascist campaigner and socialist who raises Sebastian in austere conditions. *Bruno Rontini - A cousin of John and Eustace, Bruno is a deeply religious bookseller who is seemingly at one with the world. *Mrs. Gamble - Eustace's mother in law, a blind old woman who regularly partakes in seance's to communicate with her deceased friends.

He was the first manufacturer of fine pottery in Zanesville, Ohio. Biography Samuel Sullivan was born on his father's plantation near Wilmington, Delaware on April 10, 1773. His parents were David and Jane Sullivan, whose ancestors came to America with Lord Baltimore. The plantation was near the mouth of Christina River, in view of the Delaware River. As a youth, both parents died, and he was left penniless by mismanagement or dishonesty by the administrators of the estate. Sullivan entered a pottery near Philadelphia, served an apprenticeship, and later engaged in business in that city. In 1793, he very nearly died while tending to the sick during an epidemic of Yellow fever. He married Mary Freeman. In 1804, Sullivan moved with his family to Chillicothe, Ohio. The unhealthy environment there soon prompted a move to St. Clairsville, Ohio, where they stayed until 1809. That year they moved to Zanesville, Ohio, where he stayed the rest of his life. He engaged in mercantile pursuits, and erected the first pottery that manufactured the quality goods for which Zanesville would later be famous. On January 27, 1811, Sullivan was elected by the Ohio General Assembly as Associate Judge of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas.Gilkey 1901 : 502 He served until February 4, 1815.Gilkey 1901 : 504 He was elected to the Ohio State Senate for Muskingum County, for a two- year term commencing on December 6, 1819. On February 15, 1820, Ohio State Treasurer Hiram M. Curry resigned under a cloud. A defalcation was found, and Sullivan was elected by the legislature to replace Curry on the first ballot, and served February 17, 1820 to February 17, 1823. A bond of $140,000 was required to take office. In those days, there were no bonding companies, and William Henry Harrison asked to be the first to sign Sullivan's bond. He declined, saying that he preferred bondsmen from Muskingum County. A bond several times the required amount was secured in less than an hour. Sullivan balanced the books, served one three-year term, and refused re-election. Sullivan returned to Zanesville and business life. In 1822, he was a candidate for United States representative for Ohio's 9th congressional district, but lost to Philemon Beecher. He was appointed postmaster on October 13, 1825, and retired from public life July 24, 1828. He continued in business for a few more years before retiring to his Falls Township farm. He died there October 15, 1853. Family Sullivan's grandson, Samuel Sullivan \\"Sunset\\" Cox was named after him.

In the last three years, he upgraded from an average of 27 points per game to 29 points per game in the 2007‚Äì08, with shooting averages of 50% in field goals, 54.5% in three-pointers, and 85.7% from free-throws. In his final year at West Virginia, he suffered an ACL knee injury with two games played, but still averaged 23.4 points per game, with shooting averages of 50.3% from field goals, 34.6% in three-pointers and 82.8% from the free throw line. Scott never shot less than 81.5% from the free throw line over the five years, with 2005-06, being the best with 85.9%. He finished his college career in Virginia State, with a second place in both, points over the career (2368) and over a season (892 in 2006-07), plus sixth place in scoring average (19.7). Professional career After not being drafted, Scott moved to Europe and had brief experiences at Sportino Inowroc≈Çaw in the Polish Basketball League, with an average of 20 points per game, on just 10 games, before moved again, joining BC Ferro-ZNTU on the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague. He returned to Poland in the following season, making an immediate impact, averaging 25.4 points per game and leading the league in the scoring charts. Scott then made a move to the Portuguese Basketball League to join Benfica, being an important part in the league title campaign, averaging 16.97 points per game in the regular season, and increasing to 18.72 in the playoffs, being instrumental on the game 5 of the final against Porto, on 23 May 2012. Following the performances in Portugal, he moved to the more competitive BBL in the summer of 2013, to play for the Skyliners Frankfurt under coach Muli Katzurin. He averaged 13.5 points per game in 12 games, but as the Skyliners were nearing the bottom of the table, management opted to release Scott. He finished the season at LEB Oro team, Club Melilla Baloncesto, signing on 16 February 2013, and averaging 14.8 points per game in 8 games, as the team finished dead last in 2012‚Äì13 LEB Oro season.

Attack was led by the combined operations units of Yugoslav Partisans, Land Forces Adriatic, the heavy bombers of the 15th Air Force and the light and medium bombers of the Balkan Air Force. The attacks paralysed movement of the German forces.Freeman, pp. 35-36Williams, p. 230 In his memoir Eastern Approaches, Fitzroy Maclean claims this was his idea.  Background  In the summer of 1944, Allied commanders realised that German offensive in the Balkans was slackening and that they may cut their losses and withdraw to more easily tenable defence line in the north, abandoning the region altogether. At this time, two German Army Groups (E and F) consisting of 18 divisions and around 50 additional battalions were spread across Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia.Freeman, p. 30 It became obvious that this would prolong the war in central and western Europe as the German troops get reinforcements. Their withdrawal had to be prevented or disrupted.Maclean, p. 471 While, some troops on the move were already harassed by air attacks and Partisan demolitions, this needed to be done in a more effective and systematic manner rather than ad-hoc.McConville, p. 268 by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, Allied representative at Yugoslav Partisans HQ at Vis, and the commander of the Maclean Mission, came up with a plan: Once he had the agreement of the Balkan Air Force (BAF) Commander William Elliot, the Navy, and the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean General Maitland Wilson, Maclean consulted with Tito and got his commitment as well. The territory of Yugoslavia was divided up into sectors with a Partisan Commander and his British Liaison Officer (BLO) responsible for each. The list of potential targets (such as bridges, viaducts, tunnels, railway junctions, etc.) was agreed and those that Partisans could not destroy alone were allocated to the BAF or the heavy bombers of the USAAF. Additional explosives and ammunition were dropped, and tactical and strategic air-support agreed. Finally the Royal Navy destroyers and the MTBs engaged on the sea lanes of the Adriatic coast, now in extensive use by the Germans as an alternative way out of the southern Balkans.Maclean, pp. 471-472McConville, p. 269  Key events  The main withdrawal from Greece was expected via the Vardar Valley and the Belgrade-Salonika railway. This was identified as the key target, and at the end of August 1944, Maclean flew to Bojnik in Serbia. There, he joined the local commander Koƒça Popoviƒá and his BLO John Henniker-Major to organise the destruction of the railway at Leskovac. The three officers agreed on the plan of action and relayed it to the Allied force HQ at Caserta. Maclean was left with the local commander of the 24th Partisan Division to work out the details.Maclean, pp. 472-484 The plan was for the Partisans to attack the two points north and south of Leskovac, while the town, the seat of a large German garrison, would be left to the Allied air force. On 6 September, the day of the proposed attack, an urgent message from William Elliot arrived stating that the air reconnaissance confirmed the presence of a strong concentration of armour and motor transport in town. Soon after, an air-force of fifty Flying Fortresses bombed the town heavily in a surprise attack, reducing much of it to rubble with a large number of civilian casualties.Maclean, p. 487 The attack on the remaining railroad went ahead on the same night with the Partisans blowing up small bridges and culverts as well as tearing up the sleepers and setting them on fire.Maclean, p. 489 Strategically, the operation was a success as: In other parts of the country, the operation continued, and in Slovenia, the strategic Litija bridge on the Ljubljana-Zagreb railway was destroyed with a mixture of the USAAF Mustangs and an American officer Jimmy Goodwin who joined the Partisans in the assault on the ancient castle guarding the bridge.Maclean, p. 489 Further south, the rail links between the river Sava and the Adriatic as well as the Danube bridges in the vicinity of Belgrade were also targeted.Williams, p. 230 Meanwhile, back in Serbia, Maclean had noticed a few German Junkers 52 flying northbound. Assuming that these were senior officers trying to extract themselves from the situation by air, he quickly alerted the BAF whose fighters had eventually closed this loophole.Maclean, p. 491 The doing of initial damage was followed by protracted interference with German attempts to repair it. Partisan observers reported the locations of repair gangs to the BAF HQ in Bari, who would send fighters to shoot up the restorers.McConville, p. 270 In total, over 100 locomotives were destroyed, together with many trunk railway lines, forcing the enemy onto the roads where fuel and truck shortages left them vulnerable to further attacks. It is estimated that over 300 trucks were destroyed by air-sorties and many more by Partisan raids. At the same time, Luftwaffe in Yugoslavia was crippled, losing 94 aircraft, while the Long Range Desert Group, the Special Boat Service and the Royal Navy attacked targets along the Adriatic coast.Freeman, p. 36  Conclusion  On 9 September, Bulgaria capitulated and switched sides, belatedly joining the Allies' cause. Maclean was planning to spend more time in Serbia preventing German withdrawal, but in the second half of September, he received a personal signal from General Wilson. It said that Tito had disappeared from Vis and that he needed to come out and find him. His return flight from Bojnik to Bari marked the end of the Operation Ratweek.Maclean. p. 497 References =Sources=  * World War II operations and battles of Europe Military operations of World War II involving Germany Yugoslavia in World War II Aerial operations and battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom United Kingdom‚ÄìYugoslavia relations Eastern European theatre of World War II ","title":"Operation Ratweek (1944)"},{"id":"37044459","title":"Stepfan Taylor"},{"id":"37044461","title":"Athletics at the 2007 Summer Universiade ‚Äì Women's 10,000 metres"},{"id":"37044463","text":"Mister Philippines 2008 is a male pageant in the Philippines.

History  The first bridge at this site was built in 1872. It consisted of a swing span in length with two shore spans. In 1907, each of the approach spans was divided into three plate-girder spans carried on new granite piers and abutments. However, funding was insufficient to replace the swing span, so its length was merely increased to . The current bridge is the third at this site. It is also a swing bridge and was built by the Boston Bridge Works Inc. in 1927. The bridge is no longer moveable but fixed in place to allow Point Street traffic to cross. It was last swung open in 1959. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, downstream of the Point Street Bridge and completed in 1966, rendered the swing feature of little value, because the Barrier blocks large vessels from traveling upstream before the bridge would. After WW-II, Route 1A became a major route carrying traffic from southern RI to the East Side of Providence, and points east. The Point Street Bridge was part of that route, and on exceptionally hot summer days, the bridge would expand after it opened, and with nowhere to bleed off the heat, it expanded to a point where it couldn't be closed. Traffic built up for several miles and fire tankers had to be summoned to shoot water on the bridge until it shrunk back to a size (only an inch or two) so it could be closed and let traffic resume.

The dramatic comedy was programmed at the National Theatre at the Uganda National Cultural Centre but had to relocate after the Ugandan Media Council on 16 August 2012 provisorily banned a performance in public. The Ugandan minister of ethics said the play ‚Äújustified the promotion of homosexuality in Uganda,\\" and added, \\"We will put pressure on anyone who says this abomination is acceptable.‚Äù Cecil was placed in a prison near Kampala on 15 and 16 September. A Ugandan court released him on bail on 17 September after charging him in connection with the staging of the play, charges which carried up to a potential two-year jail sentence. A petition calling for the charges against Cecil to be dropped, organised by Index on Censorship and David Lan, was signed by more than 2500 people, including Mike Leigh, Stephen Fry, Sandi Toksvig and Simon Callow. In January 2013, a magistrate dismissed all charges against Cecil. In February 2013, Cecil was again detained by the police as a person described by the Ministry of Ethics as undesirable. He was then deported back to the United Kingdom. The deportation was done very quickly and there was concern that proper legal procedure was not in place before the deportation.

They can also be used in high voltage electric power transmission grids for a similar purpose. In the control of electric motors, current limiting reactors can be used to restrict starting current or as part of a speed control system. A set of air-core reactors installed outdoors at a substation. Similar reactors are used for current limiting at transmission and distribution voltage levels.  History  Current limiting reactors, once called current limiting reactance coils, were first presented in 1915. The inventor of the current limiting reactance coil was Vern E. Alden who filed the patent on November 20, 1917 with an issue date of September 11, 1923. The original assignee was Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company.  How it works  A current limiting reactor is used when the prospective short-circuit current in a distribution or transmission system is calculated to exceed the interrupting rating of the associated switchgear. The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear. The amount of protection that a current limiting reactor offers depends upon the percentage increase in impedance that it provides for the system. Current limiting reactor The main motive of using current limiting reactors is to reduce short-circuit currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used. They can also be used to protect other system components from high current levels and to limit the inrush current when starting a large motor. Construction It is desirable that the reactor does not go into magnetic saturation during a short circuit, so generally an air-core coil is used. At low and medium voltages, air- insulated coils are practical; for high transmission voltages, the coils may be immersed in transformer oil. Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.\\"Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book\\", Westinghouse Electr Corporation, Pittsburgh PA, 1950 pp. 133-135 Line reactor A line reactor is an inductor wired between a power source and a load.

Background Reich finished the manuscript in January 1933. He submitted it to the Psychoanalytic Press in Vienna, presided over by Sigmund Freud, who initially accepted it for publication. However, Freud cancelled the contract, wanting to distance himself from Reich's politics. Reich borrowed money and published the book privately in Vienna.Kevin Hinchey, The Legacy of Wilhelm Reich, M.D., First International Congress on Wilhelm Reich, 30 October 2010 Summary Reich argues that character structures were organizations of resistance with which individuals avoided facing their neuroses: different character structures ‚Äî whether schizoid, oral, psychopathic, masochistic, hysterical, compulsive, narcissistic, or rigid ‚Äî were sustained biologically as body types by unconscious muscular contraction. Reception Harry Guntrip wrote that Freud's The Ego and the Id only gained practical importance when Reich's Character Analysis and Anna Freud's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence were published, as these books first placed ego-analysis at the centre of psychoanalytic therapy.Guntrip, Harry (1961) Personality Structure and Human Interaction, London: Hogarth Press, quoted in Boadella, David (1985) Wilhelm Reich: The Evolution of His Work, London: 54.

Maluuba's natural language understanding technology is used by several consumer electronic brands for over 50 million devices. History Maluuba was founded by four undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, G Wu, Joshua, Sam Pasupalak and Kaheer Suleman. Their initial proof of concept was a program that allowed users to search for flights using their voice. In February 2012, the company secured $2 million in seed funding from Samsung Ventures. Since 2013, Maluuba has partnered with several companies in the smart phone, smart TV, automotive and IoT space. In August 2015 Maluuba secured a $9 million of Series A investment from Nautilus Ventures and Emerllion Capital. Then in December 2015, Maluuba opened an R&D; lab in Montreal, Quebec. By 2016 the company employed more than fifty people, and had published fifteen peer-reviewed research papers focused on language understanding. On January 13, 2017, Maluuba announced they had been acquired by Microsoft for $140M. In July 2017, according to the reports, Maluuba closed its Kitchener-Waterloo office and moved employees to its Montreal office. Research Maluuba's research centre opened in Montreal, Quebec in December 2015. The lab was advised by Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal) and Richard Sutton (University of Alberta). Prior to its acquisition by Microsoft , the lab published fifteen peer- reviewed papers. The lab also partnered with local universities: University of Montreal MILA lab and McGill University. = Machine reading comprehension (MRC) = In March 2016, Maluuba demonstrated their machine reading comprehension technology on the MCTest outperforming other word-matching approaches by 8% Maluuba continued their work on MRC throughout 2016. In June, the company demonstrated a program called EpiReader which outperformed Facebook and Google in machine comprehension tests. Several research teams were able to match Maluuba's results since the paper was released. EpiReader made use of two large datasets, the CNN/Daily Mail dataset released by Google DeepMind, comprising over 300,000 news articles; and the Children's Book Test, posted by Facebook Research, made up of 98 children‚Äôs books open sourced under Project Gutenberg. Following this achievement, the company released two natural language datasets: NewsQA, focused on comprehension and Frames, focused on Dialogue. =Dialogue systems= The company has published research findings into dialogue systems which comprises natural language understanding, state tracking, and natural language generation. Maluuba published a research paper learning dialogue policies with deep reinforcement learning. In 2016, Maluuba also freely released the Frames dataset, which is a large human- generated corpus of conversations. =Reinforcement learning= The company conducts research into reinforcement learning in which intelligent agents are motivated to take actions within a set environment in order to maximize a reward. The research team has also published several papers on scalability. In June 2017, the Maluuba team was the first to beat the game Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 system. Applications Numerous applications for Maluuba's technology have been proposed in industry with several applications being commercialized. One of the first applications of Maluuba's natural language technology has been the smartphone assistant. These systems allow users to speak to their phone and get direct results to their question (instead of merely seeing a sea of blue web links that point to possible answers to their question).

The pressuremeter has two major components. The first component is a read-out unit that remains above ground. The second component of the pressure meter is a probe that is inserted into the borehole (ground) to read the pressure. History A man named Louis Menard in 1955 first brought the pressuremeter to the forefront. He started the first production of it in France in 1955. How it works The probe of the pressuremeter is inserted into the borehole and is supported at test depth. The probe is an inflatable flexible membrane which applies even pressure to the walls of the borehole as it expands. As the pressure increases and the membrane expands, the walls of the borehole begin to deform. The pressure inside the probe is held constant for a specific period of time and the increase in volume required to maintain the pressure is recorded. There are two types of tests that can be performed with the pressuremeter. The stress controlled test increases pressure in equal increments while the strain controlled test increases the volume in equal increments. How it is used The pressuremeter is used to test hard clays, dense sands and weathered rock which cannot be tested with push equipment. It allows engineers to design foundations that will be stable in these conditions. There are three different types of pressuremeters. The borehole pressuremeter is the most common and has a probe that is inserted into a preformed hole (borehole). The second type of pressuremeter is called a self-boring pressuremeter. The self-boring pressuremeter has a probe that is self-bored into the ground to prevent disturbance. The third pressuremeter is called a cone pressuremeter. The cone pressuremeter has a cone shaped probe that is inserted into the base of the borehole, it then displaces the soil into the cone of the probe which causes less disturbance to the soil to get a more accurate reading. Different soil types sometimes require different types of pressuremeter tests.

Following World War II and the austerity years of the post-war period, the 1950s were a time of comparative prosperity, which influenced fashion and the concept of glamour. Hairstylists invented new hairstyles for wealthy patrons. Influential hairstylists of the period include Sydney Guilaroff, Alexandre of Paris and Raymond Bessone, who took French hair fashion to Hollywood, New York and London, popularising the pickle cut, the pixie cut and bouffant hairstyles. The American film industry and the popular music industry influenced hairstyles around the world, both in mainstream fashion and teenage sub-culture. With the advent of the rock music industry, teenage culture and fashion became increasingly significant and distinctive from mainstream fashion, with American style being imitated in Europe, Asia, Australasia and South America. Teenage girls around the world wore their hair in ponytails while teenage boys wore crew cuts, the more rebellious among them favouring \\"greaser\\" comb-backs. The development of hair-styling products, particularly setting sprays, hair-oil and hair-cream, influenced the way hair was styled and the way people around the world wore their hair day to day. Women's hairstyles of the 1950s were in general less ornate and more informal than those of the 1940s, with a \\"natural\\" look being favoured, even if it was achieved by perming, setting, styling and spraying. Mature men's hairstyles were always short and neat, and they were generally maintained with hair-oil. Even among \\"rebellious youth\\" with longer, greased hair, carrying a comb and maintaining the hairstyle was part of the culture. Male fashion Popular music and film stars had a major influence on 1950s hairstyles and fashion. Elvis Presley and James Dean had a great influence on the high quiff-pompadour greased-up style or slicked-back style for men with heavy use of Brylcreem or pomade. The pompadour was a fashion trend in the 1950s, especially among male rockabilly artists and actors. A variation of this was the duck's ass (or in the UK \\"duck's arse\\"), also called the \\"duck's tail\\", the \\"ducktail\\", or simply the D.A. This hairstyle was originally developed by Joe Cerello in 1940. Cerello's clients later included film celebrities like Elvis Presley and James Dean. Frank Sinatra posed in a modified D.A. style of hair. This style required that the hair be combed back around the sides of the head. The tooth edge of a comb was then used to define a central part running from the crown to the nape at the back of the head, resembling, to many, the rear end of a duck. The hair on the top front of the head was either deliberately disarrayed so that untidy strands hung down over the forehead, or combed up and then curled down into an \\"elephant's trunk\\" which might hang down as far as the top of the nose. The sides were styled to resemble the folded wings of the duck, often with heavy sideburns. A variant of the duck's tail style, known as \\"the Detroit\\", consisted of the long back and sides combined with a flattop. In California, the top hair was allowed to grow longer and combed into a wavelike pompadour shape known as a \\"breaker\\". The duck's tail became an emblematic coiffure of disaffected young males across the English-speaking world during the 1950s, a sign of rebellious youth and of a \\"bad boy\\" image. The style was frowned upon by high school authorities, who often imposed limitations on male hair length as part of their dress codes. Nevertheless, the style was widely copied by men of all ages. The regular haircut, side-parted with tapered back and sides, was considered a clean cut fashion and preferred by parents and school authorities in the United States. The crew cut, flattop and ivy league were also popular, particularly among high school and college students. The crew cut style was derived from the military haircuts given to millions of draftees, and was favored by men who wished to appear \\"establishment\\" or mainstream. Daily applications of \\"butch wax\\" were used to make the short hair stand straight up from the head. Celebrities favoring this style included Steve McQueen, Mickey Mantle and John Glenn. Crew cuts gradually declined in popularity by the end of the decade; by the mid-1960s, long hair for men had become fashionable. Black male entertainers chose to wear their hair in short and unstraightened styles. In southeast Asia, a variation of the quiff that was popular was the \\"curry puff\\", styled by a bob of wavy hair just above the forehead. \\"Geek chic\\" was a fashion trend for intellectual types, with a bouffant or greased-back hair and black glasses, exhibited by the likes of Buddy Holly and Bill Evans. In the 1950s, a surfing hairstyle for men was popularized by surfers. The style featured layered long hair swept by the wind, and originally it was frequent in beach areas, like Hawaii and California.

Women generally emulated the hair styles and hair colors of popular film personalities and fashion magazines; top models played a pivotal role in propagating the styles. Alexandre of Paris had developed the beehive and artichoke styles seen on Grace Kelly, Jackie Kennedy, the Duchess of Windsor, Elizabeth Taylor, and Tippi Hedren. Generally, a shorter bouffant style was favored by female movie stars, paving the way for the long hair trend of the 1960s. Very short cropped hairstyles were fashionable in the early 1950s. By mid-decade, hats were worn less frequently, especially as fuller hairstyles like the short, curly ‚Äúelfin cut\\" or the \\"Italian cut\\" or \\"poodle cut‚Äù and later the bouffant and the beehive became fashionable (sometimes nicknamed B-52s for their similarity to the bulbous noses of the B-52 Stratofortress bomber). Stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Connie Francis, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn usually wore their hair short with high volume. In the poodle hairstyle, the hair is permed into tight curls, similar to the poodle's curly hair (curling the hair involves time and effort). This style was popularized by Hollywood actresses like Peggy Garner, Lucille Ball, Ann Sothern and Faye Emerson. In the post-war prosperous 1950s, in particular, the bouffant hair style was the most dramatic and considered an ideal style in which aerosol hairspray facilitated keeping large quantities of ‚Äúbackcombed or teased and frozen hair‚Äù in place. This necessitated a regimen of daily hair care to keep the bouffant in place; curlers were worn to bed and frequent visits were made to the hair stylist's salon. Mouseketeer Annette Funicello dramatically presented this hair style in the movie ‚ÄúBeach Party‚Äù. Short, tight curls with a poodle cut known as \\"short bangs\\" were very popular, favored by women such as first lady Mamie Eisenhower. Henna was a popular hair dye in the 1950s in the US; in the popular TV comedy series I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball (according to her husband's statement) ‚Äúused henna rinse to dye her brown hair red.‚Äù The poodle cut was also made popular by Audrey Hepburn. In the 1953 film Roman Holiday, Audrey Hepburn's character had short hair known as a ‚Äúgamine-style‚Äù pixie cut, which accentuated her long neck, and which was copied by many women. In the film Sabrina, her character appears initially in long plain hair while attending culinary school, but returns to her Paris home with a chic, short, face-framing \\"Paris hairstyle\\", which again was copied by many women. When the rage among women was for the ‚Äúblond bombshell‚Äù hair style, Hepburn stuck to her dark brown hair color and refused to dye her hair for any film. fringe \\"bangs\\", 1954 Jacqueline Kennedy wore a short hair style for her wedding in 1953, while later she sported a ‚Äúbouffant‚Äù; together with the larger beehive and shorter bubble cut, this became one of the most popular women's hairstyles of the 1950s. Grace Kelly favored a mid-length bob style, also influential. There were exceptions, however, and some women, such as Bettie Page, favored long, straight dark locks and a fringe; such women were known as \\"Beat girls\\". In the mid-1950s, a high ponytail became popular with teenage girls, often tied with a scarf. The ponytail was seen on the first Barbie dolls, in 1959; a few years later Barbies with beehives appeared. The ‚Äúartichoke cut‚Äù, which was invented by Jacques Dessange, was specially designed for Brigitte Bardot. Compact coiffures were popular in the 1950s as less importance was given to hairstyling, although a new look was stylized by Christian Dior‚Äôs fashion revolution after the war. Products Audrey Hepburn, pixie cut, 1954 In the 1950s, lotion shampoos with conditioning ingredients became popular precursors of the shampoo/conditioner rinse pairing of two decades later. The Clairol ad campaign, \\"Does she ... or doesn't she?\\" boosted hair color product sales not just for their company, but across the hair dye industry. The bouffant style relied on the liberal use of hairspray to hold hair in place for a week. Hairspray lacquers of this era were of a different chemical formula than used today, and were more difficult to remove from the hair than today's products. But even less extreme styles, such as parting hair on the left and the right before pulling the bangs to one side, required holding the style in place with hairspray. One ingredient in 1950s hair spray was vinyl chloride monomer; used as an alternative to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), it was subsequently found to be both toxic and flammable. Hair gels, such as Dippity-do, came in a variety of forms such as spray or jelly, and were referred to as \\"setting gels\\". African American hair products promised natural-looking hair to black women, with natural in this context defined as straight, soft, and smooth; these products, such as Lustra-silk, were advertised to not be heavy, greasy or damaging like pressing oils and chemical relaxers of the past. Only a small amount of Brylcreem was needed to make a man's hair shiny and stay in place; Brylcreem's tag line was \\"Brylcreem, a little dab'll do ya.\\"Sherrow, p. 365 It was also used by those who suffered from dandruff. While the conk was still popular through the end of the decade, Isaac Hayes switched to going bald. Hair growth products for men were first introduced in the 1950s, in Japan. Influence The Fonz\\" The 1950s had a profound influence on fashion and continues to be a strong influence in contemporary fashion. Some of the world's most famous fashion icons today such as Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, and David Beckham regularly wear their hair or indulge in a style of fashion clearly heavily influenced by that of the 1950s. Aguilera is influenced by Marilyn Monroe, Beckham by Steve McQueen and James Dean. The pompadour style became popular among Italian Americans and the image became an integral part of the Italian male stereotype in the 1970s in films such as Grease and television series such as Happy Days. The Fonz, played by Henry Winkler, with his greased pompadour, white T-shirt and leather jacket, has been cited as the \\"epitome of the 50s bad-boy cool\\". In modern Japanese popular culture, the pompadour is a stereotypical hairstyle often worn by gang members, thugs, members of the yakuza and its junior counterpart b≈çs≈çzoku, and other similar groups such as the yankii (high-school hoodlums). In Japan the style is known as the \\"Regent\\" hairstyle, and is often caricatured in various forms of entertainment media such as anime, manga, television, and music videos.

Max's first wife and Little Hans' mother, Olga H√∂nig, was one of Freud's patients. Graf's book Composer and Critic is noted for its amicable style with M. A. Schubart of the New York Times stating, \\"Dr. Graf has written a charming, comprehensive, intelligent treatise on music criticism, drawing generously on his own large supply of knowledge and experience.... The only major issue which I cannot reach agreement with Dr. Graf is his manner. He is much too polite. No subject in the world deserves more rudeness than music criticism.\\" Countering this impression, Graf published a deeply critical review of a Metropolitan Opera production produced by his son in 1946. In the introduction to Composer and Critic, Graf details his original interest in music criticism as having stemmed from attending the lectures of Anton Bruckner in Vienna. Max was Jewish and fled Vienna for the United States in 1938, where he taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City until 1947, when he returned to Vienna. He died there in 1958.

It is the third book in his untitled animal trilogy, following Forbidden Creatures in 2010 and The Dangerous World of Butterflies in 2009. The book explores what those who work with animals believe to be the line between using animals for entertainment purposes and abusing them. Meanwhile, the author recounts how his own opinions changed about that line when he talks to the different people about their beliefs.  Overview  Peter Laufer talks to those who work with animals for various purpose, such as a self-taught lion tamer, a slaughterhouse owner, and a scientist who fights crickets as part of his job, and asks them when using an animal for the purpose of entertainment, food, or science becomes abusing the creature. Meanwhile, Laufer recounts his own experiences on this topic, such as a voray into veganism and looking at killing ants on the kitchen counter in a different light. Laufer also searches for a cockfight throughout the course of the book and examines laws on cockfighting in various places in the United States.

Settlements and Cult Sites on Mount Hermon, Israel: Ituraean Culture in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods. BAR international series, 589. Oxford, England: Tempus Reparatum, 1993. . A few temples are built on former buildings of the Phoenician & Hellenistic era, but nearly all are considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Surveys Discovery of the Hermonian temples in rural villages began in the 19th century, with surveys by Edward Robinson and Sir Charles Warren. Ten sacred sites were also documented by Daniel Krencker and Willy Schietzschmann in 1938. Maurice Tallon published an itinerary of the sanctuaries in 1967 with details of the paths to reach them.Tallon, Maurice., ‚ÄúSanctuaires et itin√©raires romains du. Chouf et du sud de la B√©qa,‚Äù M√©langes de l'universit√© Saint Joseph 43, pp. 233-50, 1967. George F. Taylor provided a pictorial guide in the late 1960s with more recent information coming from Shim'on Dar in 1993 and epigraphic surveys in 2002 and 2003. Some of the sites have been connected with the high places used for the worship of Baal in the Books of Kings. The Seleucids occupied the area after 200 BCE, shortly after which the Ituraeans developed a principality in the area until the fall of Chalcis when the territory passed to the Herodian kings Agrippa I and Agrippa II. After the end of the first century CE the territory became jointly controlled by the cities of Damascus, Sidon and Paneas. It is thought that the area was inhabited continuously until the third century CE. Precise dating of the structures is currently not possible. Krencker and Zscheitzschmann suggested they were mostly constructed between 150 and 300 CE and epigraphic evidence has been found to support this for several temples. Construction techniques have been seen to differ from those used in shrines of the Phoenician and Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods such as Tyre, Tell Anafa and Kharayeb. Recent studies have highlighted differences in construction style of the Hermonian temples from Hellenistic architecture at Khirbet Massakeb,Kalos, M., Un sanctuaire d'epoque hellenistique en Syrie du sud: Khirbet Massakeb. Topoi, 9/2, pp. 777-794, 1999. Khirbet ZemelHartal, M., \\"Khirbet Zemel: Northern Golan: an Iturean Settlement\\" in Zvi Gal (ed.), Eretz Zafon: Studies in Galilean Archaeology, pp. 75-117, Jerusalem:IAA, 2002. and other sites in the Hauran and Jawlan.Kropp, Andreas., Limits of Hellenisation: Pre-Roman basalt temples in the Hauran, Bollettino di Archaeologia On Line, Special Volume for the International congress of classical archaeology meetings between cultures in the ancient mediterranean, Rome, 2008.Kropp, Andreas., Limits of Hellenisation: Pre-Roman basalt temples in the Hauran, Bollettino di Archaeologia On Line, Special Volume for the International congress of classical archaeology meetings between cultures in the ancient mediterranean, Rome, 2008. Although the sites may have been built on previous layers of architecture, the current temples are predominantly considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned after the fourth century AD during the Byzantine era. The temples were often connected with ancient occupational sites. Olivier Callot and Pierre-Louis Gatier argued that several of the temple sites might have been mistaken for monumental tombs as Roman mausoleums such as Saidnaya have been found in Lebanon.Callot, Olivier, and Pierre-Louis Gatier. \\"Le reseau des sanctuaires en Syrie du Nord.\\" Topoi 9, pp. 665-688, 1999. Taylor held the view that the religious architecture was the responsibility of \\"the hand of a single master builder\\" but was not able to answer the question of why so many shrines should be concentrated in the area. Henry Seyrig, when reviewing Krencker and Zscheitzmann's \\"Romische Tempel in Syrien\\" highlighted that \\"the clue to an important social and economic change that would deserve to be one day the focus of a study\\". There is still a deplorable lack of a comprehensive study into the history, archaeology, architecture of these buildings and ancient sites, or the religious life of the people who used them. Summit site of Qasr Antar Recently have been additionally discovered in 2003 the Qasr Chbib complex, made of two small Roman temples situated just a few hundred meters from the summit of Mount Hermon. Both of the sanctuaries have northern walls that were carved out of solid bedrock. There is a sacred building made of hewn blocks of stone on the summit of Mount Hermon. Known as Qasr Antar, it was the highest temple of the ancient world, sitting at above sea level. It was documented by Sir Charles Warren in 1869. Warren described the temple as a rectangular building, sitting on an oval, stone plateau without roof. He removed a limestone stele from the northwest of the oval, broke it into two pieces and carried it down the mountain and back to the British Museum, where it currently resides. An inscription on the stele was translated by George Nickelsburg to read \\"According to the command of the greatest a(nd) Holy God, those who take an oath (proceed) from here.\\" Nickelsburg connected the inscription with oath taken by the angels under Semjaza who took an oath together, bound by a curse in order to take wives in the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch 6:6). Hermon was said to have become known as \\"the mountain of oath\\" by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau. The name of God was supposed to be a Hellenized version of Ba øal or Hadad and Nickelsburg connected it with the place name of Baal-Hermon (Lord of Hermon) and the deity given by Enoch as \\"The Great Holy One\\".Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 1. A Commentary on the Book of 1 Enoch, 1‚Äì36; 81‚Äì108, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2001. Eusebius recognized the religious importance of Hermon in his work \\"Onomasticon\\", saying \\"Until today, the mount in front of Panias and Lebanon is known as Hermon and it is respected by nations as a sanctuary\\". It has been related to the Arabic term al-haram, which means \\"sacred enclosure\\". Deities Apart from the supreme god of the lofty sanctuary, other gods were evidenced to have been worshipped in the area. The god Pan is often connected with the headwaters of the Jordan river in the area. Inscriptions on stones used in the church of Heleliye near Sidon have referred to Threption, son of Neikon offering stone lions to Zeus. Other deities noted to have been worshipped in the area were called Theandrios and Leucothea, which were likely Greek names substituted for native Canaanite gods. Leucothea was the Greek goddess of the sea and she was known to have been worshipped from 60 CE at the temple devoted to her at Rakleh and also at Kfar Zabad, Inkhil, Tel Jezreel, Tyre and Segeria as evidenced by an inscription found at Ayn al-Burj. The Gods of Kiboreia are known from a Greek inscription taken from a large temple at Deir El Aachayer on the northern slopes of Mount Hermon in Lebanon.Jalabert, L., \\"Inscriptions grecques et latines de Syrie (deuxi√®me s√©rie)\\" in M√©langes de la Facult√© Orientale de Beyrouth 2, p.265-320, 1907. The inscription was found noting that a bench was installed \\"in the year 242, under Beeliabos, also called Diototos, son of Abedanos, high priest of the gods of Kiboreia\\". The era of the gods of Kiboreia is not certain, as is their location which is not conclusively to be identified with Deir El Aachayer, but was possibly the Roman sanctuary or the name of a settlement in the area. It has been suggested that the name Kiboreia was formed from the Aramaic word kbr, meaning a \\"place of great abundance\\". Sites in Lebanon George Taylor divided up the Temples of Lebanon into three groups, one group of Temples of the Beqaa Valley lies north of the road from Beirut to Damascus. Second, there is the group in the area south of the same road, including the Wadi al-Taym and the western flank of Mount Hermon. Third, the group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. There are relatively few temples along Lebanon's coastal plain. The Temples of Mount Hermon in Taylor's second group included Ain Harcha, Aaiha, Deir El Aachayer, Dekweh, Yanta, Hebbariye, Ain Libbaya, Nebi Safa, Aaqbe, Khirbet El-Knese, Mejdal Anjar, Mdoukha and Bakka. Four new sites were identified during epigraphic surveys of 2003 and 2004 at Ain Ata, Ain Qaniya, Korsei el-Debb and Qasr Chbib whilst possible identification was made requiring further investigation at the sites of Qatana, Kafr Dura, Qalaat al-Almond, Haouch Hafoufa and Mazraat el-Faqaa. The recently found Qasr Chbib is a complex of two Roman temples situated a few hundred meters from the summit of Mount Hermon. Both of the sanctuaries have northern walls that were carved out of solid bedrock of the mountain. Sites in Israel A sacred site at Tel Dan has been excavated southwest of Mount Hermon. It was shown to have had successive layers of occupation through the Pottery Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Greco-Roman, Medieval and Ottoman period.Pottery Neolithic Levels at Tel Dan. Mitekufat Haeven, Journal of the Israel Prehistoric Society 20:91-113. Bar-Yosef, O., Gopher, A., and Nadel, D. 1987. Sites in Syria Of the Syrian Hermonian temples, the easiest to reach from Damascus are at and Burqush and Rakleh. At the temple in Rakleh, there is an engraved god on one wall, surrounded by a wreath and facing towards Mount Hermon. Two other sanctuaries that have been the subject of study by Israelis in the occupied Golan Heights are Qalaat Bustra and Har Senaim.

The beginning of the end for Hallman came in the season's third game. LSU led an Auburn squad which went 11-0 in 1993 and won its first two games of 1994 under Terry Bowden 23-9 going into the final period, but lost 30-26 when Auburn returned three interceptions for touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Auburn won despite not scoring an offensive touchdown; its other touchdown came on a fumble return. Hallman's last home game as LSU coach came against his former employer, Southern Mississippi. Hallman was named LSU's coach in November 1990 after leading the Golden Eagles to 26 victories over three seasons, mostly on the strength of future Super Bowl winning quarterback Brett Favre. Southern Miss' 20-18 victory over LSU came in front of the smallest home crowd at Tiger Stadium since 1974.

The two of them had escaped the city sixteen years ago, just days after his birth during the Bosnian War. Diego, her second husband and Pietro's father, remained behind and later died. As they travel with her wartime friend Gojko, she tries to repair her relationship with Pietro, asking her third husband (by phone) if she should tell Pietro that she did not give birth to him.

In a racing career which lasted from September 1883 until May 1884 she ran six times and won five races. As a two- year-old in 1883 she won her first three races including the Middle Park Plate and the Great Challenge Stakes before sustaining her only defeat when conceding weight to the winner Queen Adelaide in the Dewhurst Stakes. As a three-year-old she won the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and The Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse a month later. She was then retired to stud where she became a successful broodmare. Background Busybody was a small, but exceptionally good-looking bay filly bred by her first owner Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth at his stud at Mereworth Castle in Kent. She was sired by Petrarch, a horse which won the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger Stakes in 1876. At stud Petrarch was particularly successful as a sire of fillies: his other daughters included Miss Jummy (1000 Guineas and Oaks) and Throstle (St Leger). Busybody came from an exceptional female family: her dam, Spinaway won the 1000 Guineas and Oaks for Lord Falmouth in 1875 and was a half sister of Wheel of Fortune, an even better racemare who won the same two races four years later. Spinaway and Wheel of Fortune were daughters of the Oaks winner Queen Bertha an influential broodmare, whose other descendants include the classic winners Larkspur, My Babu, Altesse Royale and Festoon. Lord Falmouth sent the filly into training with Mathew Dawson at his Heath House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1883: two-year-old season= Busybody first appeared at the misleadingly named \\"first October meeting\\", held at Newmarket at the end of September. In the five furlong Rous Memorial Stakes she started the even money favourite in a field of seven runners. Ridden by the champion jockey Fred Archer, she raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning comfortably by a length from the colt Knight Errant. At Newmarket's second October meeting two weeks later, Busybody, with Archer again in the saddle ran in the six furlong Middle Park Plate, the season's most valuable and prestigious race for two-year-olds. She started the 15/8 second favourite in a field of four colts and three fillies, with the Champagne Stakes winner Superba being made the even money favourite. Archer tracked the front-running Royal Fern before taking the lead close to the finish and winning by half a length. Three lengths back in third place was Sir John Willoughby's unnamed filly by Hermit out of Adelaide, who was carrying a seven pound weight penalty as a result of her win in the July Stakes. On the following afternoon, Busybody contested the weight-for-age Great Challenge Stakes over the same course and distance. She was made 7/4 favourite in a strong field which included the five-year-old Tristan and the four-year-old Despair (winner of the All-Aged Stakes). Ridden by George Fordham, Busybody produced a strong finish to win by a neck from Despair, the first two drawing well clear of Tristan in third. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting in late October, Busybody and \\"the Adelaide filly\\" met again in the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes. Busybody was carrying three pounds more than her rival on this occasion but started the 4/5 favourite and Lord Falmouth \\"declared to win\\" with her in preference to his other runner, the future Derby winner Harvester. As in her other races, Busybody was held up for a late run but on this occasion she was unable to catch the Adelaide filly and finished second, beaten a neck. Harvester finished last of the ten runners. Busybody's earnings for the season totaled ¬£3,895. =1884: three-year-old season= The finish of the 1884 Oaks from the Illustrated London News. Busybody beats Superba Before the 1884 flat racing season began, Lord Falmouth decided to retire from the turf and sell all his horses at a public auction. As a leading classic fancy, Busybody was expected to attract considerable interest, and it was predicted that she would fetch at least ¬£8,000. At Newmarket on 28 April Busybody was sold for ¬£8,800 to Tom Cannon, acting on behalf of George Alexander Baird (also known as \\"Mr. Abington\\"). Cannon was one of the leading jockeys of the day and had been associated for many years with the Danebury trainer John Day, before taking over the stable on Day's death in 1883. Four days after her appearance in the auction ring, Busybody returned to Newmarket for the 1,000 Guineas in which she was again matched against \\"the Adelaide filly\\", now officially named Queen Adelaide. Busybody was made favourite at odds of 85/40 in a field of six and was ridden by Tom Cannon. The early pace was slow and Busybody pulled hard against Cannon's attempts to restrain her before the race began in earnest two furlongs from the finish. Busybody and Queen Adelaide quickly went to the front, and after \\"a pretty race\\", the favourite prevailed by half a length, with Whitelock finishing third ahead of Sandiway, a filly who went on to win the Coronation Stakes and the Nassau Stakes. Busybody's winning time of 1:47.0 broke the existing race record by three seconds. Sources differ as to whether Dawson or Cannon trained the filly for her Guineas win, but Cannon took over her training from then on. On 28 May, Queen Adelaide started 5/2 favourite for the Derby and finished a close third to the dead-heaters Harvester and St. Gatien despite having been blocked at a crucial stage. Two days later Busybody and Queen Adelaide met for the fourth and final time in the Oaks over the same course and distance with Busybody starting favourite at the unusual odds of 100/105 in a field of nine. The race took place in fine weather and attracted a \\"large and fashionable\\" crowd. After several false starts caused by the misbehaviour of Whitelock, the race began and Tom Cannon tracked the leaders on the favourite before taking the lead on the turn in to the straight. Queen Adelaide emerged as a threat, but Busybody, racing down the centre of the course, drew ahead and opened up a clear lead approaching the final furlong. Superba made a strong late challenge but Busybody held on in an exciting finish to win by half a length, the pair finishing well clear of Queen Adelaide in third. Following her second classic win, Busybody was regarded as a contender for the St Leger, but she never raced again and at the end of the season she was retired to stud. Stud career Busybody during her retirement, c. 1890 The best of Busybody's progeny was Meddler (sired by St. Gatien), who was a leading two-year-old in Britain where his wins included the Dewhurst Stakes. He was exported to the United States where he was twice Leading sire in North America. Busybody's daughters Bass and Meddlesome became successful broodmares. Busybody was euthanised in 1899 after being infertile for three years.

It is a contributing property to the Downtown Albany Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History British army officers during the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian Wars) is considered to have been the impetus for the creation of a local lodge in Albany. The soldiers were a part of a military lodge that was organized in 1737 under the auspices of the Irish Registry, they met in Albany in 1758 and when they left certain members of the local populace who had joined the Masonic order were allowed to continue to meet and recruit for the Order until they could get own charter as a lodge. In 1765 they were made the Union Lodge #1 and in 1766 they were given the deed to a lot on the corner of Maiden Lane and Lodge Street by the city. The cornerstone of the first Temple on this site was laid the next year in 1767, with the Temple being dedicated in 1768. Prior to this meetings were held at Richard Cartwright's Southside Inn. After the US Revolutionary War the lodge gave up its charter and was reorganized as Mount Vernon Lodge #3 in 1807. The Temple is the site of meetings for five different lodges. Mount Vernon Number 3, the former Union Number 1, is the oldest lodge in the state of New York outside of the city of New York and meets at the Temple. The Guttenburg Lodge Number 737, founded in 1873 as a German language speaking lodge moved to the Temple when it was built in 1896, from their location at the WM Whitney Building, dropping German for English in 1900. The Wadsworth Lodge Number 417 has met in the Temple from the founding of the current in building in 1896, having been founded in 1856 and having different meeting places throughout Downtown Albany prior to that. Masters Lodge #5 also meets at the Albany Temple. Also Ancient Temple lodge #14 is one of the five lodges in the Albany masonic hall building at 67 corning place Albany NY. It is a merger of ancient city and temple lodge that occurred in the 1970's . Ancient temple lodge #14 will celebrate its 225th year likely in the fall of the year 2020 Structure The Masonic Temple sits at the corner of Maiden Lane (now Corning Place in honor of Mayor Erastus Corning) and Lodge Street, and is built of granite in the Renaissance Revival style. The architects were Fuller & Wheeler. The interiors feature oak woodwork and rich classical ornament in plaster. The main lodge rooms are each two stories in height. The larger room (the Ten Eyck room) has stained glass windows and an 1896 2-manual, 18-rank tracker pipe organ by J. W. Steere & Sons of Springfield MA. The smaller room (the Weaver room) has an 1874 2-manual, 18-rank tracker organ by William Johnson of Westfield MA - it and the carved walnut furnishings of the room were moved from the previous temple. On the top floor of the temple is a room with a proscenium stage, used for the degrees of the Valley of Albany, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Among the furnishings is an elaborately carved oak throne featuring Scottish Rite emblems, designed and presented by Bro. Solomon Strasser in 1898 and weighing over 400 pounds. President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt was a member while Governor of New York and a metal ramp was built leading to the banquet hall for him. This metal ramp is still in existence and is still used on a daily basis. His cousin President Teddy Roosevelt was also a member.

The album was nominated for Dance Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2013. Background and recording Recording sessions took place in London, England; Kinmount, Canada; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Lead singer Martina Sorbara listened to a Phoebe Snow album the entire period the band was making the album. She stated, \\"I find that when we're writing I think I'm more inspired by hearing something that's really different from our sound and then thinking about how that would work in conjunction with what we do. Like hearing an old 70s smooth music track and thinking, 'what would happen if we tried incorporating this into an electropop track?' But really there's not a clear line to what we do.\\" The band decided to name the album Bodyparts because it often mentions body parts in the lyrics. Dragonette announced the title on June 21, 2012. Sorbara remarked that she saw the word as \\"something musical, beautiful and sexual.\\" The band released the album's artwork on July 25. In mid-2012, the band launched a contest inviting fans to submit their own versions of the song \\"Untouchable\\", using Dragonette's original lyrics alone. The winning track was announced on September 7, and will be used as a B-side to a future Dragonette single. Release and promotion Two tracks from the album, \\"Right Woman\\" and \\"Rocket Ship\\", were uploaded to Dragonette's SoundCloud page on March 5 and June 19, 2012, respectively. The band posted the official sampler for Bodyparts online on September 4, 2012. On September 11, the album was officially streamed in full on The Hype Machine. \\"Let It Go\\" was released as the album's lead single on April 2, 2012. It reached number twenty-three on the Canadian Hot 100, becoming the band's highest-peaking solo single on the chart to date. The album's second single, \\"Live in This City\\", was released on August 7, 2012, charting at number sixty-five in Canada. \\"My Legs\\" was released on May 20, 2013 as the third and final single from the album. To promote the album, Dragonette embarked on a North American fall tour, which kicked off at the Red River Exhibition in Winnipeg on June 23, 2012 and ended at Babylon in Ottawa on October 20. The trio also performed \\"Let It Go\\" and \\"Hello\\" on Good Morning Americas Summer Concert Series in Central Park in New York City on July 20, 2012. Critical reception Allmusic's Heather Phares wrote, \\"With each album they've released, Dragonette have become more confident and focused, and Bodyparts is no exception; it should please not only longtime fans, but those won over by 'Hello'‚Äîthough it might leave some listeners hungering for something quite as undeniable as that single.\\" Greg White of So So Gay viewed Bodyparts as Dragonette's \\"strongest effort to date\\", commenting that the band \\"seem to have landed closer to the mark they've always been aiming for; a perfect blend of electro-pop glamour with a moderate dose of rock 'n roll swagger\\", although he felt that \\"[t]he album could use a little more variety\\". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine opined that \\"[w]hile nothing on the album approaches the tawdry heights of past singles 'I Get Around' and 'Gone Too Far,' Bodyparts does improve in the latter half\\", which \\"showcases far more of Dragonette's distinctive personality.\\" He continued, \\"Bodyparts is the first album on which Dragonette seem like they're maybe a little bit ashamed of themselves, hiding their most sordid tales behind some overly polite, anonymous dance tracks that are uncharacteristically vanilla.\\" Track listing ;Notes * signifies an additional producer. * LP pressings of the album omit the track \\"Rocket Ship\\".

It became the inspiration for two films (see below for details). It was originally published by Chapman and Hall in 1909, but because the copyright has expired, the text of the book is now in the public domain. There was a \\"new and illustrated\\" edition, with illustrations by Emile Verpilleux, published a year later in 1910. It may fairly be described as a sentimental novel: Temple Thurston himself wrote that \\"To many, from the first page to the last, it had not the faintest conception of reality, and indeed has earned for me the classification of sentimentalist\\". This was in the Author's Note to the sequel, entitled The World of Wonderful Reality, published a decade later in 1919. His obituary in The Times (20 March 1933) stated that \\"there were those who might suggest that sentimentalism was too evident in Temple Thurston's work\\". As well as being a vehicle for Edwardian romanticism, the novel shares the Roman Catholic faith of its author with its main characters. It is a tale of two cities: mainly Edwardian London ‚Äì the sidelights on life in London for the shabby genteel are interesting ‚Äì but also Venice. Films The first film based on the novel was The City of Beautiful Nonsense, a silent movie released in 1919, which featured Henry Edwards, Chrissie White and Henry Vibart The second film was a talkie, released in 1935 as City of Beautiful Nonsense.

It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. History The present cathedral is the result of a long series of rebuildings and repairs over the centuries. The first cathedral of Terni was built, according to local tradition, over a pagan temple by the first bishop of Terni, Saint Peregrine, in the 2nd century. Tradition states further that Saint Anastasius, bishop of Terni from 606 to 653, built another cathedral on the site in the 7th century. Repair works between 1932 and 1937 (to plans by Marcello Piacentini) uncovered in the present crypt three apses and the remains of a rose window between two mullioned windows, each of two lights, from this earlier structure. In the 9th century a major reconstruction took place which turned the earlier structure into the crypt of a new cathedral; a further re-building took place in the 12th century. Little now remains of this Romanesque cathedral, because of modernisation works in the taste of the day which were carried out in the 16th and 17th centuries, which included the raising of the height of the central nave, the refacing of the tribune and the campanile, the construction of a baptistry and of the side chapels, and above all the integration of the church and the piazza on which it stands according to Baroque designs by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century. As regards the side tower, its position was much discussed in 1500; the conclusion reached was to place it to the left of the apse, where it was rebuilt in 1743. Description The west front presents a wide portico with a double colonnade; three doors open from the portico in Romanesque style, decorated with friezes. The upper part of the frontage is modern, containing a balustrade in travertine and statues of eight bishops of Terni, among them Saint Valentine of Terni, to plans by Marcello Piacentini. The interior, on a Latin cross groundplan, has a central nave between two side aisles, divided by piers, with side chapels (including those of the baptistry and of the Blessed Sacrament), a transept and an apse. The works of art include: * Choir by Domenico Corsi (1559); * Fresco of the west wall depicting the patron saints of the city with angels (17th century); * Baptismal font with the sculpted heraldic symbol of the town (1585); * Noli me tangere, oil on canvas attributed to Guido Reni; * Agony in the Garden, oil on canvas attributed to Francesco Cincinnato, a follower of Guercino; * Tabernacle by Carlo Murena containing relics of the blood of Christ; * Organ of the 17th century; * Crypt, with the tomb of Saint Anastasius, made by reusing a pagan altar and decorating it with Cosmatesque carvings (other carvings of the same sort are preserved in the sacristy).

Noted for his studies of the origins of the War of 1812 and the war with Spain in 1898, he also wrote a two-volume biography of Cordell Hull. He was the historian who rediscovered John L. O'Sullivan and his role in originating the idea of Manifest Destiny.Julius W. Pratt, \\"Origin of Manifest Destiny,\\" The American Historical Review 32 (July 1927), 795-798. Biography The frontier and colonial nature of Pratt's family background is noteworthy. Pratt was the son of William McLain Pratt and Sophie Rand. Originally from Meriden, Connecticut, William had fought in the Civil War and married Sophie in 1869. Following the death of his father, Julius, William and Sophie moved from Connecticut to Blue Earth County, Minnesota, near Mankato along the Minnesota River Valley, in 1870, to work in the lumber industry. Economic conditions forced William to move to South Dakota while the family remained in Minnesota, but in 1886 Sophie and daughter Alice (two others had perished in Minnesota) moved to Little Elk Canyon, from Deadwood, South Dakota and from Rapid City, South Dakota. In 1888, Julius W. was born. In 1900 the family moved to the Blue Ridge region of North Carolina.

The format of the debate was broken up into two sections: the first half followed the usual \\"presidential debate\\" format, while for the second half, the three took seats closer to the audience and answered questions posted by the audience and viewers on the Internet. While the discussion topics were essentially the same as the presidential debate a few days prior, much of the event was laced with humor: an oft-reused gag was the notable height difference between O'Reilly and the Stewart ‚Äì to compensate, Stewart had a mechanical riser built into his podium, which he would often use for comic effect.

The convention that drafted the proposed constitution was composed of delegates specifically elected for the purpose, unlike the previous year's convention, which had been composed of legislators. The convention's proposal was principally drafted by John Adams, and was published in early March 1780. After an extended process of ratification debates involving town meetings, the convention approved a modified version of the March proposal on June 15, 1780, although the vote to do so was not without some controversy. The new Massachusetts State Constitution then went into effect, and the convention on June 16 issued a call to elect a governor and General Court under its terms before it finally adjourned. The state constitution adopted by the convention provided no mechanisms for amendment other than the calling of another convention. This was changed by the next constitutional convention, held in 1820 after the separation of Maine from the state precipitated a constitutional crisis. That convention ratified the constitution's first nine amendments. Members of the Convention Members of the Convention include Jason Haven and John Adams.

The game Pineapple Smash Crew is a \\"neo-retro\\" style, single player, level based, shoot-em-up game. It focuses on smashing and grabbing items, power-ups and strategy. The single player game is currently available for Microsoft Windows. Gameplay Pineapple Smash Crew is a 3-D game that gives players a top-down isometric view of the playing field. Using the mouse and keyboard, players control a squad of lost mercenaries fighting through randomized environments to recover the lost coordinates of their mother ship. As players fight the hordes of alien robots and monsters, squad members level up and gain health. The squad itself also levels up and unlocks upgrades, ranging from simple grenades to powerful lasers and mines. Before each mission, players can choose from a selection of ships to board and search. All mission layouts are randomized as are the mission objectives. As the player advances through the game, the ships become larger and enemies become more challenging. Each level is completed by beating a boss character. The mercenaries move through the game in a tightly bunched formation, each character holding a single grenade, and the players can be rotated to use various types of these grenades. Pineapple Smash Crew is a unique shooting game in that it focuses on grenades as the primary weapon, rather than a gun. There are multiple types of grenades in the game that can be used singularly or in combination, allowing for strategic game play. The primary objective of the game is to blow up everything and obtain as much loot as possible. Secondary objectives and missions are also available. The main purpose of the game is highlighted by the fact that all the visual and audio aspects of the game are purposely pixelated while the explosions occur in very high resolution. While conducting the mission objective, one of the rooms contains the boss of the level, who is randomly equipped with weapons and defenses. The boss destroys the walls of the room to create a large arena in which players must battle. Aside from the mission objectives, each ship has a computer room that helps players find coordinates for the return trip to the mother ship. Audio Soundtrack: The soundtrack consists of frantic, upbeat Chiptune music written by artist Syphus a.k.a. Echo level.

ERGs are generally based on providing support, enhancing career development, and contributing to personal development in the work environment. In the past, ERGs have traditionally been focused on personality traits or characteristics for underrepresented groups, for example women, sexual orientation, gender, etc. With the resurgence of ERGs in the workplace, ERGs are expanding to \\"interest- based\\" groups gathered around particular activities. Some of these include job responsibility, environmental advocacy, community service and volunteerism, and workplace wellness. Further, as an emerging facet of human resources and employee engagement in the business world, the existence of ERGs is important for reference and understanding in the world of business. Exploring the topic of employee resource groups can provide insightful information for business employees and young professionals seeking to understand a new business. History For the past 30 years, ERGs have helped a diverse range of groups obtain a voice within large corporations. They began as race-based employee forums that were created in response to racial tension in the 1960s. ERGs got their start when Joseph Wilson, the CEO of the Xerox Corporation took action after the violent race riots in Rochester, New York in 1964. He and his black employees formed the first caucus group in order to address the issue of discrimination and to help create a fair corporate environment. Xerox launched the National Black Employees Caucus in 1970 and a decade later followed with the formation of the Black Women's Leadership Caucus (BWLC). Early in their history, these affinity groups were a risky and political tactic of advocating for equal pay and equal opportunity. It was common for early members to feel nervous about speaking up to management about their minority status for fear of seeming like a troublemaker or having an individualistic mind-set. While original ERGs were often seen as threatening by managers, today these groups are often initiated by administrators and are a common tool for managing diversity. As of 2007 ninety percent of Fortune 500 companies have ERGs. Types There are numerous types of ERGs existing at different companies. Here are some of the most popular: * People with disabilities * Veterans * Cultural diversity * Health/Fitness * LGBT employees * Women in the workforce * Generational * Working parents * Single parents Common practices =Goal-oriented events= Successful ERGs will combine business and employee goals to provide maximum benefit. Some general common practices of these include: providing cultural support and diversity insight in company products, missions, or methods; developing products and branding for diverse target markets; and building company reputation through active community involvement. In addition, ERGs often provide resources for professional development, fostering a learning environment for better company contributions. Further, many ERGs are active in employee recruitment and engagement, attracting employees who identify with the company from the very start. Talent acquisition, communication with executives, culture awareness and change, and development are at the core of ERG functioning. Events hosted by ERGs range from in-person networking days to shared spaces for information sharing on company networks. ERG members may personally benefit from leadership and diversity training, mentoring, professional development, and skills workshops uniquely tailored to group goals. On the company scale, ERG members may provide diverse perspectives on marketing techniques, participate in product development evaluations, and communicate with executives through advisory panels. Outside the company, many ERG members advocate for larger cultural and social goals, whether for LGBT community support, multicultural rights, workplace equality, or political activism. In addition, community service has been noted as a significant part of ERG activity; this enhances company reputation while fulfilling personal goals of the employees. Though there aren't prescribed actions for ERGs to take, most ERGs are responsible for their own goals, leadership structure, and functioning. The actions are driven by the interests and characteristics of the group members, and are most successful when they are supported by executives in the company. =Role of technology= With the surge of computer mediated communication, ERGs have embraced social media and online communication to connect previously disconnected members. Of most popular use are internal social networks, external social networking like Facebook or Twitter, blogs, internal collaboration and blogging sites, webinars, podcasts, and wikis. These tools facilitate planning events and engaging in constant communication with group members. With lack of physical presence, collaboration is still possible. The most successful ERGs utilize multiple forms of social media to address the needs of all group members and ensure awareness of group events. =Structure and alignment= Though ERGs may be operated in different ways, groups usually align with some aspect of the business. Frequent alignment occurs with diversity or business and talent initiatives, where ERGs are utilized to further business objectives and maximize employee engagement and contribution. While some ERGs may have a larger percentage of the employee population involved, the average rate of membership is 7.9% of employees. Participation is usually driven by interest in sub-groups, the mission of the ERG, or the rewards and incentives for participation. ERG councils are one form of leadership within companies to collaborate among groups; this is growing in large businesses globally. Additionally, company leaders and senior executives play a role in supporting ERG functioning, and offer recognition and acknowledgement of ERG leaders as an incentive for participation. When ERG participation is rewarded in some way, whether through intrinsically motivated accountability standards or external benefits, engagement grows. In terms of accountability, peer or leadership review, business sponsorship, and elected membership serve as motivating factors. Traditional rewards for participation include personal development or advancement opportunity, cash bonus, or non- financial rewards. Not all ERGs give tangible rewards, as participation and engagement are desirable from the start. Companies with ERGs Almost 90% of Fortune 500 companies report having ERGs in 2011. Because of this rising popularity, many companies have adopted practices and have begun financially supporting resource groups. See the list below for a small sample of some of the companies with ERGs that have been analyzed in the relevant ERG research. * Allstate * American Airlines, Inc. * American International Group * Anheuser-Busch * AOL, LLC * Airbus * AT&T; * The Boeing Company * Boston Scientific Corporation * BAE Systems * BASF * Dell Inc. * DIRECTV * Dominion Energy * Southern California Edison * F5 Networks * Ford Motor Company * Gap Inc. * Garmin International, Inc. * General Motors * Henry Schein * HP Enterprise * HSBC * Kellogg Company * MasterCard Worldwide * Medtronic * McDonald's USA * McGraw-Hill Company * Microsoft * Nestl√© * Raytheon * Starbucks Coffee Company * T-Mobile * The New York Times Company * Unilever * Union Pacific Railroad * United Airlines * Verizonhttps://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/diversity-and-inclusion * Visa Inc. * Walt Disney Parks & Resorts * Workhuman =Benefits to members= Some of the major benefits that ERGs bring to their members are an opportunity to more casually work with (and network with) others outside of one's current department or workgroups, a sense of belonging (besides to the company and one's department) and support. ERGs establish a support group of people who share a common stories or experiences. These groups also provide fellowship and friendship for its members. Further, ERGs can have direct effects on the corporate culture by allowing the members of the ERGs and other employees to feel comfortable with differences within their organization. Another benefit of ERGs is the professional development that they foster. This professional development often comes in the form of skill-building (and resume building) not available in one's current role, mentoring and workshops. ERGs also provide an effective way for employees to network with other employees who share the same experiences, and through some of their company wide events, members can have the opportunity to meet other employees or management who are not in the ERG but are supportive of the cause . Belonging to an ERG also provides ERG group members access to the ERG's executive sponsor(s) and other company leaders not otherwise available to that employee otherwise. Further, ERGs have the potential to create more equality for their members. ERGs promote diversity by ensuring that all members of an organization or business have the same opportunities in having a voice in the company, access to the same information that can help their employment success, helpful networks with other employees, the opportunity to contribute ideas, and the opportunity to advance within the company. Further, in the spirit of equality, one of the goals of ERGs is to raise awareness for these different groups of people. This awareness benefits the members of the ERGs and other employees within the company to promote a productive and inclusive work environment. =Benefits to the organization= Many of the advantages of ERGs to the organization or company are tied to the aforementioned personal benefits because when the members of ERGs are benefiting, it will lead to employee satisfaction, which is productive for the company. Further, ERGs are often founded on the premise of contributing to the success of the company. Since ERGs typically have to be approved by the organization itself, the ERGs will claim to support some of the same goals as the company, which can include promoting diversity and employee satisfaction. ERGs can foster employee satisfaction because employees feel better about going to work when they know that their company has a legitimate interest in issues that are meaningful to their personal life. It is because of this increased employee satisfaction that companies with affinity groups are often rated some of the best places to work. Another benefit that comes with ERG's within a company is encouraging the inclusivity of all its employees. Diversity is important in contributing to the overall wellbeing of a workplace, and employees can find support within ERG's that align with their backgrounds and experiences. ERG's act as a cultural/experiential support groups for employees that require the insight and assistance of someone else in the company in the same ERG. Through this, employees have multiple outlets of support within a company apart from the traditional executive team that might not take into account the unique interests and needs of an employee. =Bringing about broad change= Employee resource groups have the potential to bring about broad change. They serve as an organized and established platform that employees can utilize to promote change. These changes occur in the form of policy changes, cultural changes, and improved relationships between the employees and employers. ERGs can have effects beyond those for the employer and employee, however, and instead they can promote employee activism outside of the workplace and they focus on causes of a larger societal scope. For instance, many ERGs provided aid Hurricane Katrina victims, which leads to the argument that ERGs are expanding to also affect the world community. Disadvantages =To employees= There are multiple disadvantages to employees in ERGs. Sometimes other employees resist the changing culture of the American workforce and the diversity that ERGs promote. People with these views are often opposed to change and the uncertainty that follows. This discrepancy between the ideals of the ERG and the ideals of other employees has the potential to cause rifts. Additionally, our society is currently emphasizing that an employer should meet all of an employee's needs, and ERGs are said to further this notion. Some believe that this thinking is dangerous if taken too far because it could make an employee too dependent on their employer. If ERGs are leading activists to make their lives revolve even more around work, such negative implications could arise. Some also believe that it is dangerous for an ERG member to be strongly invested in the possibility of change provided by their ERG. By becoming so invested in an ERG, there is a greater probability that that member may lose sight of the larger change that they want to see in society by instead focusing too much on the prospect of change in their specific company. Along the same lines, others believe that radical members of ERGs have to find a careful balance between supporting their cause and supporting their workplace. Since radical advocates for a cause tend to feel deeply about the issues, they can feel pressure from their advocacy groups to yield more influence in their ERG, while their ERG needs them to adopt a more conservative approach in order to contribute to and deal with the business. =To the organization= ERGs have the potential to create strained relationships between members of the ERG and upper management. Because of the fact that these management personnel have the ability to affect promised jobs and bonuses, there are situations that have the potential to arise in which ERG participation leads to discrimination. To combat this potential disadvantage to ERGs, some believe it is necessary for them to focus on gaining trust, joint learning with management, and forming alliances in order to promote change. =Competition among ERGs= Within many organizations the various ERGs compete for funds and impact on the company, and this competition can lead to various negative effects of ERGs. It is found that ERGs would be more influential if they supported one another in the promotion of diversity within the workplace, but this empathy often does not happen because of the inherent difficulties that it poses. There are numerous reasons for these disparities. One reason is that ERGs come with historical social tensions that widen the gap between groups. For instance, African American groups can fear that white women groups will take the company's concentration off of diversity and instead turn it to work/life balance. Members often want their ERG to seem unique to capture the attention of leaders in the organization, which makes supporting other ERGs more difficult. It is apparent that companies are less likely to make too many changes, so the more ERGs, the less true impact that each can have. If ERGs cooperated with one another, they would exemplify an ideal that they promote, which is to effectively and respectfully work in a diverse workplace. Their cooperation would be an excellent example of this principle, even though it would take effort to promote. Currently, Human Resource departments at some companies are focusing on bringing these ERGs together through diversity councils.

The book is a transfeminist manifesto which makes the case that transphobia is rooted in sexism and that transgender activism is a feminist movement. The second edition of the book was published in March 2016. Terminology The book extensively discusses transmisogyny, which is misogyny toward trans women. Serano also explores trans-objectification, trans-fascimilation, trans-sexualization, trans-interrogation, trans-erasure, trans-exclusion, and trans-mystification. She argues that sexism in Western culture is a twofold phenomenon, comprising traditional sexism (‚Äúthe belief that maleness and masculinity are superior to femaleness and femininity‚Äù) and oppositional sexism, ‚Äúthe belief that female and male are rigid, mutually exclusive categories‚Äù. Serano coins the term effemimania to describe the societal obsession with male and trans expressions of femininity‚Äîan obsession that she claims is rooted in transmisogyny. Themes In a collection of essays, Serano deconstructs Western societal narratives about trans women, including those of academia, medicine, and the media. She frequently cites her personal experiences as a lesbian trans woman, which differ from the predominant narrative of the heterosexual trans woman. Serano argues that \\"oppositional sexism\\" is a driving force behind cissexism, transphobia, and homophobia. In addition to oppositional sexism, she writes that traditional sexism is the second requirement for \\"maintaining a male-centered gender hierarchy.\\" Serano uses the term cissexual assumption to describe the belief among cisgender people that everyone experiences gender identity in the same way. In her book, Serano argued that cisgender people, lacking discomfort with their gender assigned at birth, nor thinking of themselves as or wishing they could become a different gender, project that experience onto all other people. Thus, it is argued, they're assuming that everyone they meet is cisgender, and \\"thus transforming cissexuality into a human attribute that is taken for granted\\". Serano wrote that cissexual assumption is invisible to most cisgender people, but \\"those of us who are transsexual are excruciatingly aware of it.\\"  Intrinsic inclinations model  Serano's argument of intrinsic inclinations was discussed in great detail in the book, taking the entirety of the sixth chapter, with much of the rest of the book relying on an understanding of this model in order to discuss the presence and place of trans women in feminism. The intrinsic inclinations model is an idea of gender and how there came to be the variation that exists amongst people in modern society. The idea that there are both biological and social factors at play in the variation that occurs in sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression is at the core of the intrinsic inclinations model, and it is how Serano attempts to explain both the typical and atypical forms of each of the three traits. This model is built upon four basic tenets. The first tenet of this model, the model's core that everything that follows is built upon, is the fact that \\"subconscious sex, gender expression, and sexual orientation represent separate gender inclinations that are determined largely independent of one another.\\" The assumption that these three things are determined individually allows for the natural variation that exists amongst people to be explained easily, as it is now simply a matter of explaining individual traits rather than trying to explain things for a society as a whole, and it allows this model to be able to explain exceptions to typical forms of gender expression without crushing the entire model. The second tenet of the model, and where the model gets its name, is the assumption that \\"these gender inclinations are, to some extent, intrinsic to our persons... and generally remain intact despite societal influences and conscious attempts by individuals to purge, repress, or ignore them.\\" Serano argues that it is because these traits are naturally occurring, the differences present in society simply represent the natural variation that is also found in numerous other species. The third tenet simply states that since there has not been one single factor that has been determined to cause any of these gender inclinations, these traits have multiple factors that determine and make up them, and, as such, a range of possible outcomes should be accepted rather than discrete classes (such as masculine and feminine). The fourth and final tenet of this model states that \\"each of these inclinations roughly correlates with physical set, resulting in a bimodal distribution pattern (i.e., two overlapping bell curves) similar to that seen for other gender differences, such as height.\\" This idea is what allows for the natural exceptions to gender expression to exist within the system without attempting to claim that they exist in as high of numbers as typical gender expression. Background In 2005, Serano's 36 page chapbook called On the Outside Looking In: A Trans Woman's Perspective on Feminism and the Exclusion of Trans Women from Lesbian and Women-only Spaces was published by Hot Tranny Action Press. It contains 4 essays. Updated versions of three of these (Bending Over Backwards: an Introduction to the Issue of Trans Woman-Inclusion, Skirt Chasers: Why the Media Depicts the Trans Revolution in Lipstick and Heels, and Hot Tranny Action Manifesto) are included in Whipping Girl. In the introduction to Whipping Girl, Serano says that she chose the title 'to highlight the ways in which people who are feminine, whether they be female, male, and/or transgender, are almost universally demeaned compared with their masculine counterparts'.

This game is a combination of poker and keno (or lotto) and is similar to the game of bingo in several aspects. Gameplay The dealer places five ranks of five squares across the board for a total of 25 squares. With another deck of cards at hand, cards are turned over one at a time and each player who has a board with that playing card pictured places a poker chip or other marking device over the square. The first player to get five squares in a row is the winner. Methods of scoring There are many possible ways to keep score in Pokeno. * The winner receives a reward, greater or lesser, according to the poker value of the line or \\"hand.\\" Note that the boards are arranged so that each vertical and horizontal line represents a different poker hand, ranging from \\"straight flush\\" to \\"one pair.\\" No boards are better than others. All are intended to be balanced. * The same as before except that the dealer continues turning over cards until every player has five in a row; the player with the highest poker hand covered is the winner. * Pokeno may be played similarly to Blackjack, where the dealer covers his own board and plays against each individual player. The dealer turns over playing cards until he has five in a row covered on his own board. Any player who does not have five in a row covered, or whose row has a lesser value than the dealer's, loses. The dealer loses to those who have rows covered of greater poker value. Larger hands may bring a greater reward. * Pokeno may be played similarly to keno. Each player except the dealer or \\"banker\\" is given a board and may bet on any figure that automatically covers one row and one column. The banker turns over playing cards and the players cover only those called that are in the two rows on which he wagers. If one of these two rows is not covered by any player so that no one is \\"out\\" by the time twenty-five cards are turned over, the banker gets the wagers. If player is \\"out\\" on either his horizontal or vertical row, that player gets a certain standard reward arranged in proportion, as in roulette. * Pokeno may be played like regular bingo with poker cards instead of numbers/bingo balls.

At present, consensus places it in the family Urticaceae.Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 12, July 2012 [and more or less continuously updated since], http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/, accessed 18 September 2012 One recent phylogenetic study placed it in a clade with Urtica, though two slightly older studies placed it as a sister clade to the Cecropieae (the former Cecropiaceae s. str.) and Urticaeae (Urticaceae s. antiq.). Older, nonphylogenetic, work placed the genus in Cecropiaceae, a family regarded as intermediate between Urticeae and Moraceae Taxonomic history Alexander Zippelius (1797-1828) is given authorship of the genus, publishing in Annales Musei Botanici Lugduno-Batavi (Amsterdam), 1: 203, in 1864. His work superseded that of Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel (1811-1871). In 1978, Berg placed it in Cecropiaceae. Most recent work has been by Datwyler & Weiblen (2004), Zerega et al. (2005), and Hadiah et al. (2008) place the genus in Urticaceae. Description Members of Poikilospermum are shrubs or tall woody climbers (also known as lianas). The petiolate leaves are alternate; their stipules are often caducous, intrapetiolar, connate, and leathery; their veins are often prominently pinnate; cystoliths occur adaxially in circular groups, abaxially along veins, either punctiform or linear. The inflorescences are solitary and axillary dichotomously branched cymes, they are unisexual (the plants are dioecious). The glomerules are capitate and either on swollen peduncular receptacles (in P. subgen. Ligulistigma, continental Asia group), in agglomerations, or are free (in P. subgen. Poikilospermum, E Malaysia group). The male flowers are with 2-4 perianth lobes, free or slightly connate; there are two to four stamens, the filaments are straight (in P. subgen. Ligulistigma) or inflexed; a rudimentary ovary is present. The female flowers have four perianth lobes, and are clavate-tubular and decussate-imbricate. The ovary in this genus is enclosed, with a short style, a capitate or ligulate (in P. subgen. Ligulistigma) stigma; the ovule is orthotropous. The seeds have little or no endosperm. The cotyledons are ovate. Distribution and habitat Plants of the genus occur naturally from Sino-Himalayan region (including NE India and Yunnan) over to Malesia, including Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, and on to the Bismarck Archipelago. In China there are 3 species. Species often have high moisture requirement, occurring in Monsoon forests and rain forests, often near streams or other we places, at altitudes ranging from 500m to 1800m. In Cambodia P. suaveolens grows in the undergrowth of dense forests. Human use One species is used to a ties (as in to tie things together).

A feminist, she was well-known during the early twentieth century for her 1912 hit play Rutherford & Son, but lapsed into obscurity in later decades.Barbara Hodgson, \\"Author Is Brought Back to Life\\", The Journal, 17 September 2009. Rutherford & Son was first revived in 1980, and since then there have been several productions, including one at the Royal National Theatre in 1994 and, most recently, by Sheffield Theatres. A biography of Sowerby by Pat Riley, Looking for Githa, appeared in 2009, with a revised edition in 2019. In addition to several plays, Sowerby wrote books of poetry and short stories for children, illustrated by her sister Millicent Sowerby. Her papers and memorabilia are in the collections at the Tyne and Wear Archives. Life and career Sowerby was born in 1876 in Gateshead, England, into the Sowerbys, a glass-making family.

At room temperature, the most stable form of scandium is the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure Œ±-scandium. It is a fairly soft metallic material that can dissolve a moderate concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.89 wt% at 22 ¬∞C. If scandium hydride contains more than 0.89% hydrogen at room temperature then it transforms into a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure, the Œ¥-phase. It can dissolve considerably more hydrogen, as much as 4.29%, which reflects the upper hydrogen content of scandium hydride. Research indicates the existence of a third phase created under extreme conditions termed the Œ∑-phase. This phase can dissolve as much as 6.30% hydrogen. Concentration dependent activation-energies are observed for hydrogen diffusion in scandium metal.

Its core units were mechanized infantry battalions. The brigade's headquarters was in the city of Gorizia and the brigade's units were based in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The brigade's name was chosen in memory of the World War I Battle of Gorizia. The brigade's sister brigade the Armored Brigade \\"Vittorio Veneto\\" was named to commemorate the World War I Battle of Vittorio Veneto. Founded in, based in, and named after the city of Gorizia the brigade's coat of arms was based on the coat of arms of the medieval House of Gorizia.  History  In 1975 the Italian Army undertook a major reorganization of its forces: the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of multi-arms brigades. As tensions with Yugoslavia over the city if Trieste were allayed by the Treaty of Osimo and because a reduction of the military service from 15 to 12 months for the army and air force and from 24 to 18 months for the navy, forced the army to reduce its forces by nearly 45,000 troops, it was decided that the units of the Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\" would contract to brigade. Therefore after disbanding most units of the division, the remaining units were used to raise the Mechanized Brigade \\"Gorizia\\" in Gorizia on 20 October 1975. The brigade's command was created by reorganizing and renaming the command of the 82nd Infantry Regiment \\"Torino\\" in Gorizia. After the activation the \\"Gorizia\\" brigade entered the Mechanized Division \\"Folgore\\", which was part of the 5th Army Corps based in North-Eastern Italy. The 5th Army Corps was tasked with defending the Yugoslav-Italian border against possible attacks by either the Warsaw Pact, or Yugoslavia or both. The Gorizia was to defend the city of Gorizia and the brigade's two infantry fortification battalions were tasked to man and hold the fixed positions of the Alpine Wall. The brigades strength was around 5,000 men and it was composed by the following units: * 30px Mechanized Brigade \\"Gorizia\\", in Gorizia ** Command and Signal Unit \\"Gorizia\\", in Gorizia ** 25px 33rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Ardenza\\", in Fogliano Redipuglia (former III Battalion, 53rd Position Infantry Regiment \\"Umbria\\", fielded 10x companies) ** 25px 41st Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Modena\\", in Villa Vicentina (former Amphibious Battalion \\"Isonzo\\" of the disbanded Lagunari Regiment \\"Serenissima\\") ** 25px 63rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Cagliari\\", in San Lorenzo Isontino (former II Battalion, 53rd Position Infantry Regiment \\"Umbria\\", fielded 12x companies) ** 25px 82nd Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Torino\\", in Cormons(former II Battalion of the disbanded 82nd Infantry Regiment \\"Torino\\") ** 25px 183rd Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Nembo\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo (former IV Battalion of the disbanded 183rd Infantry Regiment \\"Nembo\\") ** 25px 22nd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Piccinini\\", in San Vito al Tagliamento (Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks, former XXII Tank Battalion of the disbanded Lagunari Regiment \\"Serenissima\\") ** 25px 46th Field Artillery Group \\"Trento\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo (M114 155mm towed howitzers, former I Self-propelled Field Artillery Group of the disbanded 33rd Field Artillery Regiment) ** 25px Logistic Battalion \\"Gorizia\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo ** Anti-tank Company \\"Gorizia\\", in Gorizia (BGM-71 TOW anti-tank guided missiles) ** Engineer Company \\"Gorizia\\", in Cormons On 31 October 1986 the Italian Army abolished the divisional level and brigades, that until then had been under one of the Army's four divisions, came forthwith under direct command of the Army's 3rd or 5th Army Corps. Thus the Gorizia came under direct command of the 5th Army Corps. From the disbanded \\"Folgore\\" Division the Gorizia received the 53rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Umbria\\", in Pavia di Udine and at the same time ceded the 33rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Ardenza\\" to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Vittorio Veneto\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces: first the 63rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Cagliari\\" was disbanded on 30 November 1991, followed by the 53rd Infantry Fortification Battalion \\"Umbria\\" on 31 March 1993, while the 183rd Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Nembo\\" was transferred to the Paratroopers Brigade \\"Folgore\\" in 1991. During the same year the 184th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Filottrano\\" joined the brigade. At the same time for traditional reasons the battalions were renamed as regiments without changing composition or strength. For the last year of its life the brigades was composed by the following units: * 30px Mechanized Brigade \\"Gorizia\\", in Gorizia ** Command and Tactical Supports Unit \\"Gorizia\\", in Gorizia ** 25px 2nd Tank Regiment, in San Vito al Tagliamento (Leopard 1A2 Main battle tanks) ** 25px 41st Mechanized Infantry Regiment \\"Modena\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo (VCC-2 Armoured personnel carriers) ** 25px 82nd Mechanized Infantry Regiment \\"Torino\\", in Cormons (VCC-2 Armoured personnel carriers) ** 25px 184th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Nembo\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo (M109L Self-propelled howitzers) ** 25px Logistic Battalion \\"Gorizia\\", in Gradisca d'Isonzo On 30 September 1995 the 41st Infantry Regiment was disbanded. On 30 October 1996 the brigade was disbanded with the rest of its units. Only the 82nd Infantry Regiment remained and passed to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Mantova\\".

It first aired on CBS on October 18, 1998 and stars Joanna Kerns as an older woman that finds that her wish to be younger has been granted.  Plot  The film begins with a picture-perfect day at the boardwalk for a family of four, mother Emma, father Harry, son Danny and daughter Joy. Young Danny wins a prize at the shooting gallery and selects a 'wish ring' to give to his mother. He says to make a wish since it's her birthday, but she tells him she has everything she wants and will use the wish another day. Fast-forward 35 years later, and Emma is 75 years old and in a nursing home. Her husband is long gone to divorce, her son is dead, and her daughter cannot make it to Emma's birthday party. Joy has a busy life with two young children, a new business, and a husband she is starting to divorce. Emma reluctantly accepts that her family will not be able to join her for her celebration and completes getting dressed up. Being unable to find the necklace she was looking for, she finds the ring her son had given her that long ago day at the carnival. She wears it when she makes a wish and blows out the candles on her cake. In the morning she finds her wish has come true in an unusual way: she had wanted to be able to go to and be with her family to help in their difficult time and she is now 40 years younger, able to go out to them even if they don't come to her. With no time to lose (the wish lasts only for a full month) she buys new clothes and a car, and obtains work at her daughter's house as the new housekeeper/nanny (named Mame). During her time with Joy, Danny and Iris, she learns things about her daughter she didn't know before, makes her peace with her dying ex-husband, and comes to regard her son-in-law Brian as someone who should remain in her daughter and grandchildren's life. She helps more than she thought she could, doesn't accomplish as much as she set out to, and in the end comes to a new understanding with her family that will last to the end of her days.

The purpose of establishing this village was to provide suitable land for the Japanese immigrant to settle in Taiwan. The land that the government intended to establish as immigrant villages was to undergo a land and forestry survey to verify the land was vacant and assess its suitability to act as immigrant village land. The immigrant villages could be divided as privately conducted or publicly conducted. It could also be divided by occupation, a majority being farming immigrants, but also with fishing, mining, forestry and industrial immigration. The total number of Japanese immigrants during the colonial period was 500,000 people.  Background  There were several reasons why the government had promoted ‚Äúassimilation immigration‚Äù and established the immigration village for Japanese. First and the primary aim was to adjust the surplus population, in order to solve the limited farming resources in Japan; Secondly, to consolidate Japanese domination, for assimilation and the purpose of national defence; Lastly, develop preparation for Japan moving into tropical areas. The immigration was divided into four major periods. The initial privately conduct immigration period in 1895‚Äì1908, where the first immigrant village was established; The publicly conduct period by the Karenk≈ç Prefecture in 1909‚Äì1917, which introduced around 1700 immigrants into Eastern Taiwan; The privately conduct period by Tait≈ç Prefecture in 1917‚Äì1932, where the immigrants mainly settled in Taitung (Âè∞Êù±); The later publicly conduct immigration period in 1932‚Äì1945, had its development based in Western Taiwan. When the Japanese colonial rule ended in October 1945, all the Japanese immigrants were sent back to Japan with limitation on the sources they could bring home. For example, one set of winter and summer clothing, one blanket and cash no more than 1000 Yen.  The Main immigrant villages  = Kata Immigrant Village = In 1899, the Japanese entrepreneur Katakinsaburou (Ë≥ÄÁî∞Èáë‰∏âÈÉé) privately recruited immigrants to move to Taiwan. The Kata immigrant village (Ë≥ÄÁî∞ÁßªÊ∞ëÊùë), established in Wuquan City (Âê≥ÂÖ®Âüé) of modern-day Hualien County, was not only the first immigrant village established in Eastern Taiwan, but also the first Japanese immigrant village in the world. There are around 133 families and 385 residences in Kata immigrant village. However, due to its geographic location and its private administrated nature, it did not gain the trust of others. Yet, immigrants could not sustain enough for self- sufficiency and caused deaths and returns. Hence, The first period of the Japanese Immigration was not so successful. = Yoshino Immigrant Village = This is the first publicly conduct immigrant village in 1909, when the government had started to actively promote the immigration process. The Yoshino Immigrant Village (ÂêâÈáéÁßªÊ∞ëÊùë) was found in Hualien qijiao creek (Ëä±ËìÆ‰∏ÉËÖ≥Â∑ù), where sugarcane were the main production of the location. This location was originally the land of a group of aboriginals (ÈòøÁæéÊóè). For the purpose of promoting immigration, the government provided three years of free medical service, also free land usage and also discounts on various expenses. The government also built clinics, primary schools, Japanese shrines and other public faculties.  The Life of the immigrants  The Japanese immigrant villages are designed as how the original Japanese villages are like. The houses were made with bamboo and wood with a layer of hay as the roof. Tatami mats were also covered over the floor. The immigrants‚Äô main productions were tobacco, sugar and rice. In order to increase the income of the immigrants, the Japanese government imported tobacco leaves for the immigrants to plant. They can then sell the tobacco leaves to the tobacco factories and earn income. Since Eastern Taiwan is the land of sugarcane, the immigrants also planted sugarcane and produced sugar with it. Lastly, Yoshino immigrant village once produced ‚ÄúYoshino rice‚Äù, which it was the only rice Japanese emperor had used.  The heritages of the immigrant village  Although all Japanese immigrants were sent back to Japan when the Japanese colonial rule ended, several immigrant villages still exists. Such as the Yoshino immigrant village, Toyota immigrant village (Ë±êÁî∞ÁßªÊ∞ëÊùë) and Hayashita immigrant village(ÊûóÁî∞ÁßªÊ∞ëÊùë). Yet, these villages are open for public to examine the cultural heritages left during the Japanese colonial rule.

Its core units were mechanized Bersaglieri battalions. The brigade's headquarters was in the city of Milan. The brigade's name was chosen in memory of the First Italian War of Independence Battle of Goito, where the Bersaglieri corps had its baptism of fire.  History  The brigade was activated during the 1975 reform of the Italian Army, when the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of newly formed multi-arms brigades. On 21 October 1975 the 3rd Mechanized Brigade \\"Goito\\" was activated by renaming and reorganizing the command of the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment of the Armored Division \\"Centauro\\". The Goito took command of the units of the disbanded 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment. To bring the new brigade to full strength it received the 6th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Palestro\\" from the 22nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Cremona\\" of the Infantry Division \\"Cremona\\", the 3rd Field Artillery Group \\"Pastrengo\\" from the 11th Field Artillery Regiment of the Infantry Division \\"Legnano\\", and the I Services Battalion \\"Centauro\\" from the \\"Centauro\\" Division's Services Grouping \\"Centauro\\". Additionally an anti-tank company and an engineer company were raised for the Goito. The Armored Division \\"Centauro\\" was part of the 3rd Army Corps based in North-Western Italy. The 3rd Army Corps was tasked with defending Lombardy and Piedmont in case the 4th Alpine Army Corps and 5th Army Corps would have failed to stop an invasion by Warsaw Pact forces east of the Adige river. The brigade‚Äôs authorized strength was 4,733 men (272 Officers, 637 non- commissioned officers and 3,824 soldiers) and it was initially composed by the following units: * 30px 3rd Mechanized Brigade \\"Goito\\", in Milan ** Command and Signal Unit \\"Goito\\", in Milan ** 25px 4th Tank Battalion \\"M.O.

The \\"Goito\\" along with the \\"Centauro\\" and \\"Legnano\\" brigades came under the 3rd Army Corps. On the occasion the brigades dropped the numbers from their names and received new coat of arms. After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces. The first unit to be disbanded was the 6th Bersaglieri Battalion, whose battle flag was returned to the Vittoriano in Rome on 5 December 1989. The Goito itself was disbanded on 1 June 1991 along with most of its subordinate units. The remaining units were distributed among other brigades: the 4th Tank Battalion and 18th Bersaglieri Battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Legnano\\", while the 10th Bersaglieri Battalion had already moved to Bologna and joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Trieste\\" on 1 March 1991.

It was published by Wilmot Robertson (Sumner Humphrey Ireland), who also wrote The Dispossessed Majority (1973) and The Ethnostate (1992). The Dispossessed Majority was decried as a white supremacist book when notice of it was mailed to students at the Marist School and the Lovett School in 1987. The magazine and Robertson's books share much in common. The editorial office of Instauration was in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the publisher was Howard Allen Enterprises, Inc. Instauration was a magazine with diverse coverage, including economic theory, social commentary, international trends, literary pieces, and letters to the editor. Many people found the subject matter distasteful, and as a result, authorship was often anonymous or pseudonymous. For those who approve of eugenics, historical revisionism, and discussions of the racial makeup of populations, the writing of Instauration was very pleasing. But many would characterize the publication as promoting racism and Holocaust denial. Instauration also published numerous articles arguing that Christianity was a contrived religion. The magazine featured many anonymous submissions from readers in a segment called \\"Safety Valve.\\" Another column was named \\"Primate Watch\\" and listed recent news bulletins about Black people, Jews, Arabs, and others deemed non-white. The October 1990 issue features praise for David Duke, Jean- Marie LePen and Pat Robertson and hundreds of disparaging claims about African Americans and Jews. There is also an amount of opposition to Zionism, including mentions of the Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory and insinuation that the Gulf War was a machination of Jewish interests. Mitch Berbrier, in an article titled \\"Impression Management for the Thinking Racist\\", characterizes the effort embodied in the magazine as \\"stigma transformation\\", intended \\"to present an intellectualized rhetoric of racism and white supremacy\\". The divergence of opinion about Instauration can be seen in an article in the Orlando Sentinel, where the contrasting opinions of Stephen Chapman (Chicago Tribune) and Joseph Sobran are offered.Chapman, Stephen (June 22, 1986). \\"National Writer Sullies Name By Cavorting With The Unsavory\\".

The water is blown out of the boiler with some force by steam pressure within the boiler. Bottom blowdown used with early boilers caused abrupt downward adjustment of boiler water level and was customarily expelled downward to avoid the safety hazard of showering hot water on nearby individuals. Surface blowdown is removed from the steam drum at the top of the boiler and Bottom blowdown is removed from the mud drum at the bottom of the boiler. Background A steam boiler evaporates liquid water to form steam, or gaseous water, and requires frequent replenishment of boiler feedwater for the continuous production of steam required by most boiler applications. Water is a capable solvent, and will dissolve small amounts of solids from piping and containers including the boiler. Continuing evaporation of steam concentrates dissolved impurities until they reach levels potentially damaging to steam production within the boiler. Without blowdown, impurities would reach saturation levels and begin to precipitate within the boiler. Impurity concentrations are highest where steam is being produced near heat exchange surfaces. Precipitation would be expected to occur in the form of scale deposits on those heat exchange surfaces. Scale deposits thermally insulate heat exchange surfaces initially decreasing the rate of steam generation, and potentially causing boiler metals to reach failure temperatures.Kemmer p.39-2 Surface blowdown Surface blowdown continuously bleeds off a low volume of water from within the boiler as a means of ridding the boiler of dissolved impurities. It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum at the top of the boiler. There are two types of surface blowdown fittings. The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level. A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a swivel joint to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float.Woodruff, Lammers&Lammers; pp.230-234 The skimmer may be more effective at removing floating oil which might otherwise cause foaming. Surface blowdown is normally fed to a flash tank and heat exchanger for heat recovery. The flashed steam can be used in the feedwater heater. These energy economies are seldom practical with infrequent bottom blowdown. Surface blowdown offers the additional advantage of steady-state operating conditions.Woodruff, Lammers&Lammers; pp.269&270 Bottom blowdown Some boiler water treatments cause precipitation of impurities as insoluble particles anticipating those particles will settle to the bottom of the boiler before they become entrained in water circulating past the heat exchange surfaces. These water treatments often include compounds forming a sludge to entrap such particles; and boilers intended for such water treatment include a structure called a mud drum at the lowest part of the boiler. Bottom blowdown involves periodically opening valves in the mud drum to allow boiler pressure to force accumulated sludge out of the boiler. Similar blowdown connections at the bottom of water wall headers are blown down less frequently.Betz pp.106&107 Several short blowdown events remove sludge more effectively than a single continuous blowdown. Shorter blowdown events cause less significant changes in boiler water level, and are safer during periods of high steam demand.Woodruff, Lammers&Lammers; p.270 Bottom blowdown piping drains the lowest parts of the boiler so it can be used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the blowdown valve. The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.

Paterson Langlands was well known for its gold mining equipment, being the first company in Victoria to take up the manufacture of mining machinery, and it played an important role in equipping Victoria's and Australia's first mineral boom in the 1850s and '60s. The company's products including stamper batteries and ore crushing mills, were distributed over Australasia from Charters Towers to the Thames goldfields of New Zealand. The first stamp mills made in Australia were manufactured by Langlands, who devised the first stamper system based on the principle of the stamp and shank being rotated by the lifting cam, thus equalizing the wear on the stamp. Up to that time the shanks were square and did not rotate. While this was an invention of Fulton, he did not patent the idea, and so it was quickly copied all over the world. Major facilities included a Bessemer converter (1887) to produce steel and a cast-iron pipe- making shop which produced water, sewerage and hydraulic pipes, and structural columns, including those for Princes Bridge.eMelbourne, Langlands Foundry The firm also exported equipment and technology, such as its fitting out of the Nelson City Gas Works New Zealand.Journal of the Nelson and Marlborough Historical Societies, Volume 1, Issue 3, November 1983 J.

Bill Graham, journalist/author (1951 ‚Äì 11 May 1996).Graham's long time colleague and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes described him: \\"In many ways, he was a founding father of modern Irish music. He inspired a whole generation of Irish fans and musicians to look at the world in a different and broader light. And he was good on more than music too. He felt a kinship with Northern Ireland and the people on both sides of the sectarian and political divide there that was unusual in those who were brought up within the narrow confines of the culture of Ireland in the '60s and '70s ‚Äì and his political writing reflected this. And he was also ahead of the game in terms of his appreciation of the importance of the politics of food and the position of the developing world in the new era.\\" Graham was instrumental in the formation of Irish rock band U2, having brought them to the attention of their manager Paul McGuinness. At a recent exhibition of early group photos, McGuinness remembered the role Bill Graham played by introducing him to the band. Despite being widely known as the man who \\"discovered\\" U2, it was a title he disavowed. He wrote enthusiastically about the band, giving them their first exposure. Both guitarist The Edge and Bono have explained Graham's role in the band's development. John Waters observed that \\"It is often said that Bill 'discovered' U2. This is untrue. Bill created U2, through his enthusiasm for them. He gave them a reflection of their own possibilities and they only looked back that once\\"... He had a \\"deep knowledge of virtually every form of popular and roots music... and Waters goes on to credit him as 'the first Irish writer to write about the connection between Irish political culture and Irish rock'n'roll'.  Books  Book written by Graham include Enya: The Latest Score, U2: In the name of love : a history and Complete Guide to the Music of U2.

The Southern Railway operated the Queen and Crescent Limited from Cincinnati, Ohio to New Orleans, Louisiana via Lexington, Kentucky, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Birmingham, Alabama and Meridian, Mississippi. The new train carried both coaches and Pullman sleepers and a dining car. Its road numbers on the Southern Railway were #43 (southbound) and #44 (northbound). Accidents * On the first year of operation, the train derailed on October 15, 1926, one half mile south of Williamstown, Kentucky. One engineer died and another was seriously injured, but no passengers died. * On February 4, 1947, the Queen and Crescent struck a car and killed three persons near New Orleans. End of service The Queen and Crescent was removed from the timetable by 1949 and only a remnant remained: Southern operated Train numbers 43 and 44 between Birmingham, Alabama and Meridian, Mississippi as a local.

It is an evergreen shrub to small tree and is endemic to the heaths and button grass sedgelands of western Tasmania. It occurs most often in moist heath and scrub and occasionally in the alpine regions, but generally prefers well-drained but poor soils. It can grow in some rainforests where it forms a small tree but is normally a shrub in all other situations. The heaviest concentrations are along the island's south coast. Its leaves are dark green, hairless and almost succulent. Masses of white flowers are produced in erect spikes from the ends of the branches. Measuring 8 to 12 cm high, they appear in January and February. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described Agastachys odorata in 1810, and it still bears its common name today. The genus only contains the single species, and has been grouped with the Australian genera Agastachys, Symphionema and New Caledonian genera Beauprea and Beaupreopsis in the subtribe Cenarrheninae by Johnston and Briggs in 1975. However, Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker reviewed the suprageneric relationships of the Proteaceae in 2006, using molecular and morphological data. In this scheme Agastachys and Symphionema are sister taxa in a clade which diverged early from the main lineage, and they are classified in their own subfamily Symphionematoideae.

The fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Nadine developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September 10\\\\. By the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, well away from any landmass. Early on September 15, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. Soon after, an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine and by September 16 it was back to a tropical storm. On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores but late on September 19, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. On September 21, the storm curved south-southeastward while south of the Azores. Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a non-tropical low pressure area. Due to favorable conditions, the remnants of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 24\\\\. After re-developing, the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered slowly across the eastern Atlantic. Eventually, Nadine turned south-southwestward, at which time it became nearly stationary. By September 28, the storm curved northwestward and re- strengthened into a hurricane. The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of on September 30\\\\. By the following day, however, Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm, as conditions became increasingly unfavorable. Strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures significantly weakened the storm. Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 3, and merged with an approaching cold front northeast of the Azores soon after. The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October 4 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands. Origins A large tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa, on September 7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September 8, bringing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48 hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September 9, which further increased convective activity. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September 10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200 UTC on September 10, while the storm was about west of Cape Verde. Although thunderstorm activity was initially minimal around the center of circulation, a convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September 10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, but because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September 11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000 UTC on September 12. Strengthening and initial peak intensity alt=Nadine after becoming a hurricane on September 15. An eye is not visible. By September 12, a central dense overcast developed and due to favorable conditions, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of rapid deepening. Intensification continued at a quicker albeit less than rapid rate on September 12\\\\. Later that day, sustained winds reached . By early on September 13, convective banding wrapped almost completely around the center and cloud tops reached temperatures as low as . However, because microwave satellite data could not determine if an eye had developed, Nadine's intensity was held at ‚Äî‚Äìjust below the threshold of hurricane status. The National Hurricane Center noted that \\"the window for Nadine to strengthen may be closing\\", citing computer model consensus of an increase in wind shear and little change in structure. The storm then began experiencing moderate southwesterly wind shear on September 13, generated by a mid- to upper-level trough and a shear axis a few hundred miles to the west of Nadine. As a result, the storm struggled to develop an eye and the center became more difficult to locate. Although the storm was disorganized, a scatterometer pass indicated tropical storm force winds extended outward up to . The satellite appearance of Nadine became more ragged by September 14\\\\. Despite this, the storm remained just below hurricane status and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of intensification if wind shear decreased in the next few days. Nadine turned northward on September 14 as it tracked along the periphery of a subtropical ridge. Soon after, a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass indicated that core convection began re-organizing. However, because wind shear displaced the mid- level circulation to the north of the low-level circulation, Nadine was not upgraded to a hurricane. Because Nadine would approach colder sea surface temperatures, significant strengthening was considered unlikely. Due to an increase in satellite intensity estimates and re-organization, Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14\\\\. Six hours later, Nadine reached an initial peak intensity with winds of . Satellite imagery indicated that a ragged eye feature was attempting to develop late on September 15. Weakening and initial post-tropical transition alt=Nadine in a weakened state after passing south of the Azores on September 20. Late on September 15, National Hurricane Center forecaster Robbie Berg noted that Nadine began \\"to look a little more ragged\\", as microwave data observations noted shearing of deep convection to the northeast of the center. Late on September 16, the eye became tilted and disappeared, convective bands began disorganizing, and the overall shower and thunderstorm activity waned since early that day. Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm on September 17 and a trough reduced its satellite appearance. Dry air began impacting Nadine on September 17, though outflow from the storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the burst in deep convection on September 17 deteriorated. Later on September 18, most of the deep convection dissipated. The strongest showers and thunderstorms that remained were in a band to the west and northwest of Nadine's center. Nadine threatened the Azores while moving northeastward and then northward between September 18 and September 19, though a blocking ridge prevented the storm from approaching closer to the islands. Its closest approach to the Azores was about south-southwest of Flores Island on September 19. The storm then re-curved east-southeastward on September 20, after the ridge weakened and the mid- to upper-level trough deepened. By late on September 21, much of the remaining deep convection was composed of only a ragged convective band with warming cloud tops. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center re-classified Nadine as a subtropical storm at 2100 UTC on September 21, due to an above-average, asymmetrical wind field and an upper- level low pressure area near the center. However, post-season analysis concluded that Nadine degenerated into a non-tropical low pressure area three hours earlier. Regeneration, peak intensity, and demise alt=Tropical Storm Nadine with its eye-like feature on September 25, despite winds of only 45 mph (75 km/h) Early on September 22, the National Hurricane Center noted that regeneration into a tropical cyclone was a distinct possibility. The remnant low pressure area soon moved over warmer seas and a low-shear environment, causing deep convection to re-develop. Thus, Nadine became a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on September 23\\\\. Another blocking ridge over the Azores forced Nadine to move west-northwestward on September 24, causing it to execute a small cyclonic loop. Although winds increased to 60 mph (95 km/h), the storm weakened again and decreased to a tropical storm on September 25. Despite this regression, satellite imagery indicated that Nadine developed an eye-like feature. However, the National Hurricane Center later noted that it was a cloud-free region near the center of the storm. By September 26, Nadine curved south-southwestward to southwestward around the southeastern portion of a mid- to upper-level ridge over the western Atlantic. After minimal change in strength for several days, Nadine finally began to intensify on September 27, due to sea surface temperatures warmer than . At 1200 UTC on September 28, Nadine re-strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated that the storm re-developed an eye feature. After becoming disorganized, the National Hurricane Center erroneously downgraded Nadine to a tropical storm on September 29 before upgrading it to a hurricane again six hours later. Nadine had actually remained a hurricane and was intensifying further. Winds increased to 85 mph (140 km/h) on September 30, after the eye became more distinct. At 1200 UTC, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . After peak intensity, Nadine began weakening once again and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC, on October 1. Northwesterly winds began to increase on October 3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500 UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October 3, Nadine became devoid of any deep convection. At 0000 UTC on October 4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while about southwest of the central Azores. The low rapidly moved northeastward, degenerated into a trough of low pressure, and was absorbed by a cold front later that day. Impact and records alt=Nadine is rather disorganized, with ragged banding features and a partly exposed center of circulation. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued on two separate occasions as Nadine approached the Azores. At 1000 UTC on September 18, a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Flores and Corvo. Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100 UTC, a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo, Faial, Flores, Graciosa, Pico, S√£o Jorge, and Terceira. At 1500 UTC on September 19, a tropical storm warning was also issued for S√£o Miguel and Santa Maria. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September 21\\\\. After re-generating, Nadine posed a threat to the Azores again, which resulted in a tropical storm watch for the entire archipelago at 1500 UTC on October 1\\\\. Nine hours later, 0000 UTC on the following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. After Nadine became extratropical, the warning was discontinued. On the storm's second approach toward the Azores, schools were closed and flight were cancelled. Late on September 20, Flores reported a wind gust of . A sustained wind speed of and a gust up to were reported at Horta on the island of Faial, as Nadine passed to the south on September 21\\\\. During the second Azores impact on October 4, the highest sustained wind speed reported was on S√£o Miguel, while the strongest gust was at the Wind Power Plant on Santa Maria. On Pico Island, the pavement of the sports hall of the primary and secondary school in Lajes do Pico was destroyed. The remnants of Nadine produced a plume of moisture that dropped heavy rainfall over the United Kingdom, particularly in England and Wales, reaching 5.12 in (130 mm) at Ravensworth in the former. The rains flooded houses and disrupted roads and rails. Nadine lasted a total of 24 days as a tropical, subtropical, and post-tropical cyclone, including 22.25 days as a tropical system. This makes it the fourth longest-lasting Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, only behind the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane at 28 days, Hurricane Ginger in 1971 at 27.25 days, and Hurricane Inga in 1969 at 24.75 days. When only counting time spent as a tropical storm or hurricane ‚Äì 20.75 days ‚Äì Nadine is the third longest-lasting, behind only Hurricane Ginger in 1971 and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane. When Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14, it marked the third-earliest forming eighth hurricane, behind only an unnamed system in 1893 and Ophelia in 2005.

The building has had different names over the years, and was put to many different uses. It was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and partially demolished in September 2012. The theatre was recognised as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with registration number 3140. One of its most notable aspects was its use as a public meeting venue of Kate Sheppard during her women's suffrage campaign. History The original facade of the Tuam Street Hall including a significant parapet (removed in 1960) A syndicate of citizens formed the Public Hall Company Ltd and through this commissioned the building. The theatre, located in 214 Tuam Street, was built in 1883 to a design by Thomas Stoddart Lambert (1840‚Äì1915). It had a capacity of 2,200 people, 600 of whom fitted into the gallery. The stage was initially wide and deep. The building was opened on 20 July 1883, with the Mayor of Christchurch, George Ruddenklau, presiding. The final curtain for the Odeon Theatre The building's original name was Tuam Street Hall or Tuam Street Theatre. The building had a variety of rather diverse uses: public meeting place, entertainment, exhibitions, roller skate rink, and other activities. In 1893, it was used by Kate Sheppard for women's suffrage. After the 1893 Electoral Act was passed on 19 September 1893, which meant that New Zealand women were the first in the world to be granted the right to vote, an enrolment meeting was held by Sheppard at Tuam Street Hall on 26 September in preparation for the 1893 election in late November. Despite rather unfavourable weather, 600 women were enrolled that day. In 1894, the name changed to Opera House. Vaudeville was the main form of entertainment around the turn of the century, and John Fuller's son Benjamin started their theatre company's involvement with the building in 1903. Sidney Luttrell was commissioned to remodel the building's interior, and the modified space opened on 26 December 1927, providing seating for 1,300 people. The dimensions of the stage were changed to wide, deep, and high, and there were then 19 dressing rooms. With the introduction of film in 1930, the name was once again changed, this time to St James. The stage remained, though, and the building was sometimes used for other purposes, for example live entertainment. St James closed for a period during the Great Depression. Notable performers during the 1940s include the Trapp Family Singers, Stanley Holloway, Johnny Devlin, Laurence Olivier, and Olivier's second wife Vivien Leigh. Kate Sheppard made extensive use of the Tuam Street Hall during her women's suffrage campaign Ownership changed in 1960 to Kerridge-Odeon Ltd, and the building was renamed Odeon and reopened on 27 September 1960. Extensive changes were undertaken, including the removal of the parapet, reduction of seating down to 720, updating of the cinema equipment, and introduction of a coffee lounge. Through competition with television, patronage declined and the theatre eventually closed. The building was purchased in 1983 by the Sydenham Assembly of God, who used it for religious gatherings from 1985. The building was bought in 2003 by a group of businessmen, who in May 2004 applied for demolition consent. In response, the Odeon Theatre Trust was formed by residents concerned for the preservation of the building. Ownership changed again in December 2006, when Property Ventures Ltd, the development company of David Henderson, purchased it. Property Ventures had its office in a building diagonally opposite the Odeon Theatre at 179 Tuam Street. When Henderson's companies got into financial difficulties, Christchurch City Council controversially bought five of his inner city land holdings in August 2008, but not the Odeon Theatre. Henderson was placed in bankruptcy in November 2010. The Yellow Cross bar in SOL Square, utilising the cross from the Odeon Theatre fitted by the Sydenham Assembly of God During the years of the Sydenham Assembly of God ownership, a large yellow illuminated cross was displayed on the theatre's frontage (the bracket still visible in photos post-2008). Henderson used the cross in the SOL Square development (located on the north side of the Property Ventures head office) and styled one of the bars as the Yellow Cross, prominently displaying the cross on the roof apex. In 2009, Christchurch actor and director Mark Hadlow campaigned for the Odeon Theatre to be turned into an arts complex for an estimated NZ$60m. Heritage listing On 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number 3140. The building is recognised as the once largest public meeting venue in Christchurch, the oldest remaining theatre in Christchurch, and the then country's oldest masonry theatre. Of significance is the use of the building by Kate Sheppard. Another aspect is the building's association with two important Christchurch designers, Lambert and S. Luttrell. Earthquake damage The building was severely damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Demolition was ordered by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in January 2012. In September of that year, the rear of the building was demolished.See photos in Commons category The front of the building is protected by a stack of shipping containers placed in Tuam Street; it is hoped to retain at least the fa√ßade of the building, but its future is uncertain; this is still the case as of September 2017.

Modelled after 13th-century Gothic style churches, it is among the Gothic Revival buildings built by the British during their rule in India. British architect Sir William Emerson, who also designed the Victoria Memorial, Kolkata, designed the cathedral in 1871. It was consecrated in 1887 and was completed four years later. The church celebrates its anniversary on All Saints' Day (1 November) and has been part of the Church of North India since 1970. The cathedral is at the centre of a large open space at the crossing of two of the principal roads of Allahabad, MG Marg and SN Marg. History All Saints Cathedral, Allahabad at night The land for the cathedral was granted by Sir William Muir, the lieutenant governor of the North Western Provinces; thereafter Elizabeth Huntly Wemyss, his wife, laid the foundation stone on 10 April 1871. British architect Sir William Emerson was employed to design the building, he had already designed the Crawford Market, Bombay, and followed this with the Muir Central College, Allahabad (1872‚Äì78), which is now part of the Allahabad University According to The Building News, 25 November 1887, the cathedral was commenced some 15 years previously, and was at first intended for the cathedral of the North- Western Provinces and to have an open verandah and ambulatory all round. It was, however, afterwards decided that the cathedral of the North-Western Provinces should be at Lahore instead, though it is now thought probable that this will eventually form the cathedral church of a new diocese. Following the extension of the railway network, Allahabad has grown to the extent that it has been found necessary to provide for the addition to the transept and choir of a nave accommodating a much larger congregation that was originally expected The general simplicity of detail was necessitated by the class of workmen obtainable in this part of India at the time of construction. The work was carried out in a cream-coloured stone with fine red sandstone dressings, and the roof is covered with red local tiles. Architecture The cathedral's nave is about 40 feet wide and 130 feet long, the total length of the church is about 240 feet and the internal width is about 56 feet. It is designed to accommodate 300 to 400 persons. It is a remarkable example of the architecture of colonial India. The glass and marble work of the Cathedral is perfectly preserved even after more than 125 years, The Cathedral also houses many plaques which depict the death of different British nationals for a variety of reasons during their rule in India. The church is surrounded by a lush green garden. The pulpit is an exceedingly fine piece of workmanship in alabaster by Mr Nicholls of Lambeth, from Mr Emerson‚Äôs designs. Narrow aisles were made in the building thus giving a total internal width of about 56 feet. There are two transepts to the north and south respectively, a chancel with an ambulatory, a central tower at the intersection of the nave and transepts and a west porch. The lantern tower, Victoria Tower, is a memorial to Queen Victoria.

The patient, Audrey Death, has two brothers whose activities before and during the First World War are interwoven into her own story. Busner brings her back to consciousness using a new drug (L-Dopa, which was used for the same purpose by Oliver Sacks in the 1970s). In the final element of the story, in 2010 the asylum is no longer in existence and the recently retired Busner travels across north London trying to find the truth about his experience with his patient. The novel is written in a flowing fashion without chapters and very few paragraph breaks between scenes. It intercuts between different time periods and is composed of interlaced narratives.

The story involves multiple futures. Amazon is currently working on a television series adaptation of the book.  Summary  The novel focuses on Flynne and her brother, Burton. Burton is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps' elite Haptic Recon force. Burton is hired for a security job which takes place in what he thinks is cyberspace. When Flynne temporarily takes his place, she witnesses something that may have been murder.http://www.bookdepository.com/Peripheral-William- Gibson/9780399158445?b=-3&t;=-20#Fulldescription-20 According to GQ's Zach Baron:  Plot  The novel begins sometime in the near-future in a small town in rural America. Flynne Fisher works at a local 3D printing shop and lives with her mother and her brother Burton, who sustained brain trauma from cybernetic implants he received while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps' elite Haptic Recon unit. When Burton heads to another town to counter-protest the protests of a religious extremist group known as Luke 4:5 (similar to the modern day Westboro Baptist Church), he asks her to take over his job working security in a video game/virtual world for a supposedly Colombian company called Milagros Coldiron. Flynne takes the job and notices the game world looks suspiciously like London, but far more empty and more futuristic. Piloting a security quadrocopter, she fends off paparazzi drones from an unknown woman's high-rise apartment. On the second night of doing so she witnesses a man and a woman out on a balcony, where the woman is apparently killed and gruesomely devoured by a swarm of nanobots; Flynne is uncertain whether this is real or part of a virtual game. The novel alternates between Flynne's experiences and those of Wilf Netherton, a publicist who lives in the early 22nd century, seventy years later than Flynne's time, and several decades after an apocalyptic time known as the Jackpot took place. As the book begins, Wilf is working with Daedra West, an American artist/celebrity/diplomat, on establishing relations with a group of deformed native humans on an enormous cultivated garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean known as \\"Patchers\\". However, Daedra's reckless behavior triggers her personal security system, killing all the Patchers and their boss, named Hamed al- Habib. Wilf is fired (he assumes; he doesn't check his mail) and goes to his friend Lev Zubov's house, Lev being the son of a powerful and wealthy Russian family that moved to Britain several generations ago. Lev, a \\"continua enthusiast\\", introduced Wilf to \\"stubs\\", digital links to computer systems in the past, hosted by an inscrutable computer server in China. Milagros Coldiron is really their front organization to the past in which Flynne and Burton live, a past which has - because of the contact from the future - branched off the original timeline on which Wilf lives. Wilf hired Burton Fisher to be drone security for Daedra's sister, Aelita, as a novelty gift. When Aelita goes missing, Wilf realizes that the drone was the only witness of the event while all other recording devices were disabled. Returning from his trip, Burton tells Flynne that Milagros Coldiron wants to speak with her. Via a video call, she tells Wilf and the others about what she saw on the tower, but Wilf is reluctant to tell her that the murder was not part of a game. He does tell Flynne that an assassination contract has been put out on Burton, on their timeline, using the darknet. Burton responds by getting his military colleagues to set up a perimeter around their house. Shortly after, his friend Conner, a quadruple amputee confined to a motorized, road-capable wheelchair, kills four armed men in a car heading up the country road to their house, using a mentally-controlled gun rig. Milagros Coldiron begins using their advanced technology and foreknowledge to build financial and political power in the past. Wilf, Lev, and their allies in the further future are visited by Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer, investigating Aelita's disappearance. When they tell her what Flynne told them, she insists that Flynne be brought to the future via a peripheral (a cyborg avatar that users can connect to from another location) via the quantum server so that Flynne can identify the man who was present when Aelita died, to help solve the case. Lev and his assistants Ash and Ossian send back 3D printing instructions for a peripheral- controlling headset, which Flynne's computer-savvy friends Macon and Edward use to create a connectivity headband for her called \\"the crown\\". She connects to a peripheral that has been brought to Lev's house, where Wilf explains that this is really the future, albeit not one possible for her now that her timeline has been altered. Lowbeer notices that Daedra is holding a new party at her sister's apartment, and she gets Wilf to get himself and Flynne's peripheral invited, with Wilf pretending that the peripheral will be controlled by a woman who studies neoprimitive art and is a huge fan of Daedra's work. Deciding they might need extra muscle to confront Daedra, Wilf's group recruits Conner to manufacture another crown and control another peripheral, a bodyguard for Wilf at the party; Conner is ecstatic at being able to walk again while piloting a peripheral. Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, a second group of assassins is killed by Burton's military colleagues. Milagros Coldiron attempts to \\"buy\\" the state governor, who, like most officials of the time, is corrupt, to avoid a police investigation. Burton's group use Milagros Coldiron's money and connections to build a secure base and acquire military equipment. Flynne is kidnapped by one of Burton's colleagues under blackmail by a local drug baron named Corbell Pickett. Pickett explains that the people who killed Aelita are operating corporate collective called Matryoshka with the goal of killing Flynne, and Pickett is negotiating a higher reward before executing her. She is rescued by Burton and Conner, who kill Pickett and destroy his compound. Wilf's crew in the future make her, Burton, and their friends executives of Coldiron USA, which is now battling economically and politically against Matryoshka around the globe, and declares their base the corporate headquarters. Wilf reveals that the Jackpot begins in the middle of the 21st century as a combination of climate change and other causes, followed by a series of droughts, famines, pandemics, political chaos, and anarchy. 80% of the global human population dies off. But as this is going on, scientists have created nanotech called Assemblers that begins to rebuild society, as well as finding other scientific and engineering breakthroughs. As a result, everything is very efficient and advanced in Wilf's future, but it has mostly empty cities and most natural animal species are extinct. Wilf, Flynne and Conner (the latter two in their peripherals) go to Daedra's party, which has become a celebration of Aelita's life. Flynne spots the man who killed Aelita, but he and Daedra kidnap them, revealing themselves to be behind the plot to kill Flynne. Conner's peripheral is killed while trying to escape. The man who was present when Aelita was killed is revealed to be Hamed al-Habib, who had been \\"killed\\" by Daedra as a peripheral that day on the garbage patch, and had undergone surgery to revert himself to a more normal human form long ago. Daedra and Hamed have conspired with a city official named Sir Henry, who holds the position of remembrancer, to exterminate the patchers and sell their resources to profit themselves. Aelita was killed for reasons not entirely clear, most likely because Hamed and Daedra feared she was going to sell them out. Conner (operating a robotic weapon designed in another stub under Lowbeer's influence) and Burton (operating a peripheral-like exoskeleton) break into the room where Flynne and Wilf are being held. Flynne and Burton fire special weapons that direct Assembler nanobots, and both Hamed and Sir Henry are eaten down to the bone by the machines; Daedra is temporarily detained but is released after interrogation. In Flynne's world Matryoshka becomes completely inoperative and Milagros Coldiron gains uncontested power. Years later, Flynne winds up married to the police officer she had long been interested in; her brother and their friends find love as well. Conner receives a set of bionic limbs constructed from plans sent from the future. Wilf finds love with his former coworker from Canada, with whom he moves in. He and Flynne still connect back and forth between timelines to see each other; Flynne meets weekly with Lowbeer (via peripheral) to discuss the changes to Flynne's world that are being made through the funding of Milagros Coldiron in an attempt to avert the Jackpot.  Creation and publication  Gibson was working on the book as early as August 2012. The Peripheral was Gibson's 13th book. On April 19, 2013, Gibson appeared at the New York Public Library and read from the first chapter: \\"The Gone Haptics\\". The book was published in November 2014. Gibson's book Agency is set in the same world as The Peripheral, also involving alternative but connected futures.  Critical reception  The Peripheral was positively received by The Guardian. According to GQ's Zach Baron, \\"Like many Gibson books, The Peripheral is basically a noirish murder mystery wearing a cyberpunk leather jacket and, after an uncharacteristically dense first one hundred pages, a super enjoyable read‚Äîthough perhaps less so when you consider just how accurate Gibson can be when he's thinking about what might come next. Because according to The Peripheral, what is coming next is, to borrow Gibson's phrase again, well‚Ä¶fucked.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald noted an \\"ultimate lack of narrative cohesion,\\" but said that the book was still dense with \\"imaginative technological inventions and societal extrapolations, not least on capitalism, government surveillance and retro Third World colonialism.\\" The Irish Times wrote that it was \\"a formidable novel, and one that boasts just about the only plausible depiction of time travel in recent fiction. But it does suffer from slow pacing and a flat final-act climax.\\" The Financial Times gave it a mixed review, calling the \\"twin narratives is complex and tangled,\\" but overly drawn out over the book's nearly 500 pages. The Verge said the book was a \\"smart, nuanced twist on time travel\\" and praised how detail was integrated more into the characters' lives than his other recent series. NPR gave the book a positive review. The Toronto Star said it could be difficult to keep up with the book, but it was \\"fast-paced and chock full of fascinating speculations into not only what the future will look like, but how it will work.\\"  Television adaptation  A TV series adaptation was commissioned in 2018 by Amazon to be developed by Westworld creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan. The series was put into development in April 2018 with a \\"script-to-series commitment\\", receiving a firm go-ahead in the middle of November 2019. Beyond Joy and Nolan, executive producers include Athena Wickham, Steven Hoban and Vincenzo Natali. It will have one-hour episodes and will be developed by Kilter Films, through Amazon Studios. Warner Bros. Television is also involved as a producer, with Scott B. Smith as writer. Smith created the series, and will be the showrunner, as well as executive producer. Natali will direct the show's pilot.

Background  Huo Yanwei was born in 872, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. He was from Quzhou (Êõ≤Âë®, in modern Handan, Hebei), but his birth name is lost to history. When he was 13 (i.e., in 885), he was either captured by or taken in by Huo Cun (), then a general under the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and who was also from Quzhou.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 21. He became a soldier under Huo Cun, and Huo Cun, favoring him for his good disposition and good looks, adopted him as a son. Even before Huo Yanwei had his guan li (coming of age ceremony at or before age 19), he became known to Zhu Quanzhong, and Zhu Quanzhong made Huo Yanwei a member of his guard corps. During Zhu Quanzhong's subsequent battles, Huo had accomplishments and therefore was gradually promoted in the ranks. (His father Huo Cun would die in battle against Zhu Quanzhong's enemies Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) in 893, when Huo Yanwei was 21.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. During this early stage of Huo Yanwei's career ‚Äî either while serving under his father Huo Cun or under Zhu Quanzhong ‚Äî Huo Yanwei suffered an arrow wound in one of his eyes while in battle and became blind in that eye.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 46.  During Later Liang  In 908, by which time Zhu Quanzhong had seized the Tang throne, ending Tang and starting Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, Huo Yanwei was serving as a commander of the police for the eastern capital Kaifeng and a commander of the emperor's guards. That year, he was made one of the two commanders of the elite Longxiang Army (). In 909, he was made one of the commanders of Tianwu Army (), and then as a grand general of the guards. In 912, Emperor Taizu's son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying assassinated Emperor Taizu and took the throne himself. Shortly after, 3,000 Longxiang Army soldiers stationed at Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Luoyang, Henan) mutinied under the officer Liu Chongyu (). Zhu Yougui sent Huo and Du Yanqiu against the Longxiang mutineers. Huo and Du defeated the mutineers and captured and executed Liu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. In 913, another son of Emperor Taizu's, Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun, rose against Zhu Yougui along with Emperor Taizu's nephew Yuan Xiangxian, and Zhu Yougui committed suicide, allowing Zhu Youzhen (who changed his name to Zhu Zhen shortly after) to take the throne. Huo was cooperating with Yuan in the plot, and shortly after was made the prefect of Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), and later the acting military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). In 914, Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), which was then part of one of Later Liang's rival states, Qi, was poisoned to death by his son Li Yanlu, who took control of the circuit. In 915, Li Jihui's adoptive son Li Baoheng () killed Li Yanlu and surrendered Jingnan's two prefectures (its capital Bin Prefecture and Ning Prefecture (ÂØßÂ∑û, in modern Qingyang, Gansu)) to Later Liang. Zhu Zhen made Huo the military governor of Jingnan. Qi's prince Li Maozhen (Li Jihui's adoptive father) subsequently sent the general Liu Zhijun to put Bin Prefecture under siege, and after half a year, after Liu was unable to capture it and after Qi suffered large losses in an unrelated attack by Former Shu ‚Äî costing Qi its Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu) and causing Liu's family, who lived at Tianxiong's capital Qin Prefecture (), to become captives of Former Shu ‚Äî Liu withdrew (and subsequently defected to Former Shu, to protect his family members). Huo was therefore able to hold Jingnan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. (Huo's biographies in the History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties, however, attributed this to Huo's releasing Qi soldiers that he captured to gain Qi's goodwill.) Huo was later made the military governor of Xuanyi Circuit (ÂÆ£Áæ©, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and then Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). He later became the commander of all Later Liang forces on its northern border with its archrival Jin. However, after a number of losses in battles against Jin, he was demoted to be the acting military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). In 921, when Zhu Zhen's cousin Zhu Youneng () the Prince of Hui rebelled against Zhu Zhen at Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), Zhu Zhen sent Huo, as well as Wang Yanzhang and Zhang Hanjie (), against Zhu Youneng. They quickly defeated Zhu Youneng and forced him to return to Chen, where they put him under siege and forced him to surrender.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 923 ‚Äî shortly after Jin's prince Li Cunxu declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong) ‚Äî the new Later Liang commander of the army against Later Tang, Duan Ning, made a plan for a four-prong assault on Later Tang. As part of Duan's plan, Huo was supposed to head toward Zhen Prefecture (ÈéÆÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). However, before Duan could actually launch the attack, Emperor Zhuangzong crossed the Yellow River, bypassing Duan's main army (which Duan had intended to command to confront him), and headed directly for Daliang (i.e., Kaifeng),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. which Zhu Zhen had made capital (after Emperor Taizu and Zhu Yougui had both had their capital at Luoyang), which was defenseless since Duan had taken all the available troops. Zhu Zhen, facing defeat, committed suicide, ending Later Liang.  During Later Tang  = During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign =  Early in Emperor Zhuangzong's reign  Emperor Zhuangzong entered Daliang and announced a general pardon for Later Liang subjects. Huo Yanwei was among the first Later Liang local governors to head to Daliang to show submission to him, arriving only after Yuan Xiangxian. Emperor Zhuangzong held a feast for the Later Liang generals who submitted to him, and at the feast, praised his adoptive brother Li Siyuan, stating to Li Siyuan: Upon hearing these words, Huo and the other former Later Liang generals, worried that Emperor Zhuangzong still bore grudges, bowed down and begged forgiveness. Emperor Zhuangzong pointed out that that was all in the past, and awarded them with clothes and money, before sending them back to their circuits. In 924, when Khitan forces made an incursion into Later Tang territory and attacked You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing), Emperor Zhuangzong sent Li Siyuan north to relieve You Prefecture and to repel the attack, with Huo serving as his deputy.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. It was said that because of this opportunity to serve under Li Siyuan, and because Li Siyuan liked Huo's personality, they became friends. Shortly after, Emperor Zhuangzong bestowed on Huo the imperial surname of Li and gave him a new name of Shaozhen. Later in the year, after he served under Li Siyuan in quelling a mutiny at Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), he was made the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu).  Role in Emperor Zhuangzong's defeat  In 926, after Emperor Zhuangzong killed the major general Guo Chongtao, the army was much perturbed, and mutinies occurred in many places throughout the realm. One of the mutinies was led by the officer Zhao Tai () at Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Emperor Zhuangzong sent Li Shaozhen against the Xing rebels, and he quickly defeated them, capturing Zhao. He then took Zhao and the other rebels, joined forces with Li Siyuan (who was then attacking rebels at Yedu), and executed Zhao and the other Xing rebels in the presence of the Wei rebels, to try to shake their resolve. Nevertheless, the Yedu rebels did not crumble, and shortly after, Li Siyuan's own troops mutinied and forced him (and Li Shaozhen) to join the Yedu rebels in the city. The Yedu rebels' leader, Zhao Zaili (), however, allowed Li Siyuan and Li Shaozhen to leave the city, where 5,000 soldiers from Zhen Prefecture who had previously been under Li Siyuan's and Li Shaozhen's command joined them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Li Siyuan pondered his next step. He considered returning to Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered at Zhen Prefecture), which he was the military governor of, and then submitting a report to Emperor Zhuangzong begging forgiveness for the defeat. Li Shaozhen and Li Siyuan's strategist An Chonghui advised against it ‚Äî pointing out that another general, Li Shaorong, who had also retreated in light of Li Siyuan's army's mutiny, would then use this opportunity to accuse Li Siyuan of rebelling himself. Rather, they advised heading south toward Luoyang (which Emperor Zhuangzong had made capital) to see if he could explain the situation personally to Emperor Zhuangzong. Li Siyuan accepted their suggestion. Meanwhile, the eunuch monitor of the Wuning army at Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture (), believing that Li Siyuan and Li Shaozhen had both rebelled, wanted to slaughter Li Shaozhen's family and close associates, but the acting military governor Chunyu Yan () acted first, killing the eunuch monitor, to avoid this. Shortly after, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself. Li Siyuan thereafter arrived at Luoyang and took control of the city, initially only claiming the title of regent. Part of the orders he issued was to look for and welcome the imperial princes back to the palace. Two of Emperor Zhuangzong's biological brothers, Li Cunque () the Prince of Tong and Li Cunji () the Prince of Ya, were then hiding among the common people. Li Shaozhen and An located them, but instead of taking them back to the palace as Li Siyuan had instructed, they opined that Li Siyuan should next take the throne and that these imperial princes' presence would interfere with that plan, so they killed Li Cunque and Li Cunji without approval from Li Siyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Meanwhile, while the situation was still calming down in Luoyang, Li Shaozhen was in charge of many of the key decisions. Despising Duan Ning (whose name Emperor Zhuangzong had changed to Li Shaoqin) and another former Later Liang general, Li Shaochong (ÊùéÁ¥πÊ≤ñ, n√© Wen Tao (), he arrested Li Shaoqin and Li Shaochong, intending to put them to death. An, however, questioned him on it, pointing out that Li Shaoqin's and Li Shaochong's crimes occurred during Later Liang and that, in effect, Li Shaozhen was carrying out personal vendettas. Li Shaoqin and Li Shaochong were subsequently stripped of their imperially-bestowed names, but (at that point) allowed to live. = During Emperor Mingzong's reign = Shortly after, Li Siyuan was finally resolved to take the throne (after first repelling the forces of Emperor Zhuangzong's son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei, forcing Li Jiji to commit suicide). Li Shaozhen and another former Later Liang official that he recommended, Kong Xun, believed that Tang's Mandate of Heaven (which Emperor Zhuangzong claimed to inherit) has already ended and that Li Siyuan should start a new dynasty of his own, but other officials and Li Siyuan himself, pointing out that he was adopted into the family of Emperor Zhuangzong's grandfather Li Guochang and father Li Keyong and believing that he could legitimately claim succession from Emperor Zhuangzong, rejected the idea. Li Siyuan subsequently claimed the Later Tang throne (as Emperor Mingzong). Shortly after, a number of generals, including Li Shaozhen, who had been bestowed imperial clan names by Emperor Zhuangzong, requested to have their original names restored, and Emperor Mingzong granted the request, so Li Shaozhen again assumed the name Huo Yanwei. Huo was thereafter made the military governor of Tianping. However, at that time, Emperor Mingzong was faced with a mutiny at Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), where, late in Emperor Zhuangzong's reign, the officer Wang Gongyan () had killed the eunuch monitor Yang Xiwang () and seized control of the circuit. Wang subsequently refused to let the military governor Fu Xi (), who had been away on a campaign against another mutiny, to return to Pinglu, and refused to yield control of the circuit to the imperial government. Emperor Mingzong commissioned Wang as the prefect of Deng Prefecture (ÁôªÂ∑û, in modern Yantai, Shandong), but Wang refused to report there. Emperor Mingzong thereafter moved Huo to Pinglu as its military governor, and Wang, fearing Huo's reputation, left Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture () to head for Deng. Huo ambushed him and killed him, along with his coconspirators. Huo died in late 928, while still serving as the military governor of Pinglu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276.

There are two main types of VVL: discrete, which employs fixed valve lift amounts, and continuous, which is able to vary the amount of lift. Continuous valve lift systems typically allow for the elimination of the throttle valve. When used in conjunction with variable valve timing (VVT), variable valve lift can potentially offer infinite control over the intake and exhaust valve timing. History In 1958 Porsche made application for a German patent, also applied for and published as British Patent GB861369 in 1959. The Porsche patent used an oscillating cam to increase the valve lift and duration. The desmodromic cam driven via a push/pull rod from an eccentric shaft or swashplate. It is unknown if any working prototype was ever made. Fiat was the first auto manufacturer to patent a functional automotive variable valve timing system which included variable lift. Developed by Giovanni Torazza in the late 1960s, the system used hydraulic pressure to vary the fulcrum of the cam followers (US Patent 3,641,988). The hydraulic pressure changed according to engine speed and intake pressure. The typical opening variation was 37%. In September 1975, General Motors (GM) patented a system intended to vary valve lift. GM was interested in throttling the intake valves in order to reduce emissions. This was done by minimizing the amount of lift at low load to keep the intake velocity higher, thereby atomizing the intake charge. GM encountered problems running at very low lift, and abandoned the project. Discrete =Honda= In 1989, Honda released their Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system. Which switches to a separate cam profile at high engine speeds to improve peak power. Later versions added VVT as well as 3 stage valve lift. =Nissan= Nissan introduced its Nissan Ecology Oriented Variable Valve Lift and Timing on its Nissan VVL engine it featured two-stage valve lift. =Toyota= Toyota's first VVL system was VVTL-i, a two-stage valve lift system that also incorporates variable valve timing. Like VTEC it has a normal and \\"wild\\" profile on the same camshaft. This system was only used on the 2ZZ-GE engine. =General Motors= General Motors (GM) introduced Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) on the third generation Ecotec engine. The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the valve rocker arm switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary hydraulic lash adjuster, allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Sep/0917_intakevalve.html =Fiat Chrysler Automobiles= Fiat Chrysler Automobiles added two-stage valve lift (VVL) to the 2016 update of its Pentastar engine along with improvements to its variable valve timing (VVT) system. =Porsche= Porsche introduced VarioCam Plus which added two-stage intake valve lift to its VarioCam system. =Subaru= Subaru introduced i-Active Valve Lift System (i-AVLS) on the 2nd generation EJ25 (EJ253) which features two-stage intake lift, however it is only used on one of the two intake valves. 2nd generation EZ30 uses two stage lift shims, bucket, on all intake valves. For the EZ36D, it was replaced by D-AVCS, Dual VVT on the intake/exhaust cams. =Mitsubishi= Mitsubishi introduced its Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing and lift Electronic Control (MIVEC) in 1992, it featured two-stage valve lift. Continuous =BMW= In 2001, BMW introduced the Valvetronic system. The Valvetronic system can continuously and precisely vary intake valve lift, and in addition, the independent Double VANOS system can concurrently vary the timing for both the intake and exhaust valves. The precise control the system has over the intake valves allows for the intake charge to be controlled entirely by the intake valves, eliminating the need for a throttle valve and greatly reducing pumping loss. The latter alone can boost both power output and fuel economy 10-15%. Furthermore, both systems can also be combined with BMW DIVA (Differentiated Variable Air Intake) system which is the world's first continuously variable length intake manifold. As of 2017 BMW is the only company which can implement all three Variable Valve Timing, Lift and Intake Manifold in continuous adjustment form on production car. =Honda= Honda's Advanced VTEC, which does not appear in any of its production vehicles as of 2018, allows for continuously VVL versus its previous VTEC systems which had discrete lift settings. Although it was speculated that it would first be used in 2008 Honda Accord, the vehicle instead utilizes the existing i-VTEC system. =Nissan= Nissan introduced its Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application was on the VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW‚Äôs, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines.Kiga, S. (2007). Development of Innovative Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) System. Society of Automotive Engineers, 400 Commonwealth Dr , Warrendale, PA, 15096, USA. SAE Technical Paper Series. The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; this is why it does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric control shaft inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric control shaft, the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift. =Toyota= Toyota introduced its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder.Moriya, Y. (1996). Newly developed intelligent variable valve timing system - continuously controlled cam phasing as applied to a new 3 liter inline 6 engine. SAE Special Publications, (1171) Each actuating member is made of two finger followers on either side of a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached to the end of the intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member. =Fiat Chrysler Automobiles= Fiat's Multiair technology which allows not only variable valve timing (VVT) and variable valve lift (VVL) but also a variable cam profile.
