It is endemic to southwestern Sumatra, Indonesia. Its type locality is Kubu Perahu village, Liwa District, West Lampung Regency, Lampung Province, Sumatra. It has blue eyes, and accordingly, common name blue-eyed litter frog has been proposed for it. Description The type series consists of one adult female (holotype), one adult male, and a juvenile. The female measures and the male in snout‚Äìvent length. The head is broad and dorsoventrally depressed. The snout is rounded in dorsal view and truncate in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct. The finger and toe tips are rounded. The toes have some webbing whereas the fingers are unwebbed. The dorsal coloration is dark brownish gray, fading to laterally to light grey of the ventral side. The supratympanic ridge is bordered by a very thin brownish orange line. There are white and yellow dots on the belly and especially on the sides. The iris is light blue with black reticulations. The male has an internal vocal sac but lacks the keratinized spines (seen in some of its congeners) on its upper lip. Habitat and conservation Leptobrachium waysepuntiense occurs in leaf litter of lowland rainforests as well as cacao and rubber plantations at elevations of above sea level. The major threat to this species is deforestation, which is primarily driven by expanding oil palm plantations. However, it has a relatively large range and is believed to have a large total population, and it is not considered threatened as a species. It is present in the Batang Toru Protection Forest and the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park.

It was considered a subspecies of the little free-tailed bat until 2010.Napier, M. C. (2013). Genetic Variability of Chaerephon Atsinanana (Chiroptera) Within the Context of the Afro-Malagasy Molossidae: A Mitochondrial and Nuclear Perspective (Doctoral dissertation, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville). During the day, they are known to roost in man-made structures such as the roofs or attics of buildings. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 2010 as the result of a taxonomic split of the little free- tailed bat, Chaerephon pumilus. With the taxonomic revision, all \\"C. pumilus\\" on Madagascar were reclassified as C. atsinanana, meaning that C. pumilus range no longer includes Madagascar. The species name \\"atsinanana\\" is derived from the Malagasy word meaning \\"from the east.\\" Description The interaural membrane in the northern free-tailed bat (dorsal view) It is considered a relatively small member of the free-tailed bat family. Its forearm length ranges from long. Its ears are united by a connecting process referred to as the interaural membrane. It can be distinguished from the similar little free- tailed bat by its broader antitragus and tragus (ear). Its dorsal fur is blackish-brown, with a brown throat and dark-brown ventral fur. Some individuals have a small patch of white fur mid-venter, though this is uncommon. Its flight membranes are dark in color. Biology It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day. As of 2010, all known roosts were in manmade structures such as schools, churches, and houses. It is possible that its population has increased with urbanization due to the abundance of artificial roosting sites. Natural roost sites for this species possibly include caves and rock crevices, though this is not yet confirmed. Range and habitat It is found in several sites throughout eastern Madagascar, from above sea level. Conservation It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. This species is possibly harvested for bushmeat.

Description The head office is located in Lviv on Sakharov Street. Under the leadership of LCE \\"Lvivelectrotrans\\", there is one tramway, one trolleybus depot, a car repair workshop, a railroad service and a power network of the contact network. In March 2010 the company was ranked third in the rating of the best electric transport enterprises in Ukraine. It is a loss-making enterprise, because the state authorities only compensate 60% of the cost of transportation of privileged categories of passengers. In order to remedy this situation, a composting system was introduced from 2008, which allowed a significant reduction in the number of personnel of the enterprise. All the conductors were released, instead the staff of controllers was recruited (40 people, which is several times less than the number of conductors). To reduce the number of \\"rabbits\\" - unpaid passengers - a large-scale advertising campaign is being conducted. History So, in November 2008, the advert of \\"Do not be the killer of Bandera\\" started, the main slogans of which were \\"Do not be like the killer of Stepan Bandera!\\" And \\"Betrayal of Ukraine begins with an unpaid travel!\\".

The key idea of the Cirac‚ÄìZoller proposal is to mediate the interaction between the two qubits through the joint motion of the complete chain of trapped ions. The quantum CNOT gate acts on two qubits and can entangle them. It forms part of the standard universal set of gates, meaning that any gate (unitary transformation) on the N-qubit Hilbert space can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a sequence of gates from the universal set. The qubits on which the Cirac‚ÄìZoller gates operates are represented by two internal states (called in the following g and e) of trapped ions. An additional auxiliary excited state a is used to implement the gate. Due to their mutual Coulomb repulsion the ions line up in a linear chain. The ions are cooled to their collective ground state, so that the quantization of the motion of the chain becomes relevant. The proposal assumes that each ion can be individually addressed by laser pulses. Both the transitions \\"g\\\\to e\\" and \\"g\\\\to a\\" can be driven by choosing different laser polarizations. For each transition, one can distinguish two kinds of such pulses. Those on resonance with the transition and those that are detuned from the respective transition by an energy difference that corresponds to the energy of a single quantum of motion of the ion chain. The former are called direct pulses, the latter sideband pulses. The proposal uses red sideband pulses (that have less energy than corresponds to the direct transition). The Cirac‚ÄìZoller gate between two qubits represented by ions A and B is then realized in a three-step process: # A red sideband pulse is directed onto ion A. Length and strength of the pulse are chosen such that it realizes the following transformation: if initially ion A is in state e and the ion chain in the ground state, then at the end of the pulse the ion is in state g and the chain in its first excited state 1. Conversely, g is mapped to e if initially the chain was in its first excited state: g_A,1\\\\rangle \\\\mapsto -i e_A,0\\\\rangle and e_A,0\\\\rangle \\\\mapsto -ig_A,1\\\\rangle, all other states are unaffected. Certain states with more motional excitations (such as, say g_A,2\\\\rangle) would be affected, but are never populated throughout the protocol, since ground state cooling is assumed. This transformation is referred to as a \\\\pi-pulse. # A 2\\\\pi-pulse is applied to the ion B on red sideband of the \\"g\\\\to a\\"-transition: this changes the phase of the ion B if it is in the state g and the chain is in the first excited state: g_B,1\\\\rangle \\\\mapsto - g_B,1\\\\rangle, all other states are unaffected. Given initial cooling and the design of the first step this means that the phase of ion B is flipped only if ion A originally was in the state e. # Another red sideband \\\\pi-pulse on ion A completes the two-qubit gate. This returns ion A and the motion of the chain to its initial state. In total, the three pulses realize the following transformation on the two-qubit subspace in the motional ground state: :\\\\begin{matrix} &\\\\xrightarrow{(1)}&&\\\\xrightarrow{(2)}&&\\\\xrightarrow{(3)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ gg0\\\\rangle && gg0\\\\rangle && gg0\\\\rangle && gg0\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\\\ ge0\\\\rangle && ge0\\\\rangle && ge0\\\\rangle && ge0\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\\\ eg0\\\\rangle && -i gg1\\\\rangle && i gg1\\\\rangle && eg0\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\\\ ee0\\\\rangle && -i ge1\\\\rangle && -i ge1\\\\rangle &&  ee0\\\\rangle \\\\end{matrix}, that is, the state ee acquires a phase -1 the other three states are unaffected. This transformation is called a controlled-phase gate (U_{c-Z}), since the first qubit controls whether a phase flip (which corresponds to applying the Pauli \\\\sigma_z matrix) is applied to the second qubit. It can be turned into the CNOT gate by applying a single-qubit gate, the Hadamard gate to the ion B before and after the application of U_{c-Z}: :U_{\\\\mathrm{CNOT}} = (1\\\\otimes H) U_{c-Z} (1\\\\otimes H). The central theoretical realization, on which the above steps and much of the subsequent theoretical progress in trapped-ion quantum computation is based, is that the ion chain driven by red sideband pulses realizes the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model for the two-level system formed by g and e and one of the normal modes of the chain.Namely the one whose frequency is resonant with the detuning of the laser pulse. To achieve this, it is necessary that the light interacting with the ions can change their motional state. This requires Raman transitions. To suppress transitions in which more than one quantum of motion is transferred, one has to work in the Lamb Dicke regime where the wavelength of the light used is large compared to the size of the wave packet of the trapped ion. This reduces the coupling strength and leads to a relatively slow gate. The Cirac‚ÄìZoller gate was experimentally first realized (in slightly modified form) at the University of Innsbruck by Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler and coworkers in the group of Rainer Blatt with two Calcium ions.

She is best known as the wife of activist Joe Dallet, and then of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Early life Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Vissering was born in Recklinghausen, Germany, on August 8, 1910, the only child of Franz Puening and his wife K√§the Vissering. Although she claimed that her father was a prince and that her mother was related to Queen Victoria, this was untrue. Her mother was a cousin of Wilhelm Keitel, who later became a field marshal in the German Army during World War II, and was hanged in 1946. Kitty arrived in the United States on May 14, 1913 aboard the SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. Her father, a metallurgical engineer, had invented a new kind of blast furnace, and had landed a position with a steel company in Pittsburgh, and the family settled in the suburb of Aspinwall, Pennsylvania. Although her first language was German, she soon became fluent in English, speaking both languages without accent. Her parents regularly took her with them on summer visits to Germany. After graduating from Aspinwall High School in June 1928, Kitty enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh. She lived at home and attended freshman classes in mathematics, biology and chemistry. Her father now worked for Koppers, and held patents for the design of blast furnaces. Kitty convinced her parents that it would be a good idea for her to study in Germany for a time, and she sailed for Europe in March 1930. It is doubtful that she took any classes, but she did meet Frank Ramseyer, an American studying music in Paris under Nadia Boulanger, before sailing for home on 19 May. Kitty completed the first year of her degree, but married Ramseyer before a Justice of the Peace in Pittsburgh on 24 December 1932. The couple moved to an apartment near Harvard University, where Ramseyer hoped to pursue a master's degree in music. However, she re-enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh in January 1933, and returned to her parents' house in Aspinwall. In June 1933 she sailed to Europe again, with her husband. When she returned, she enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, although there is no record of her ever completing any classes. She obtained an annulment of her marriage from the Superior Court of Wisconsin on 20 December 1933. She later told friends that she had discovered evidence that Ramseyer was a homosexual and a drug addict. She also had an abortion. Communism At a New Year's Eve party later that year, Kitty met Joseph Dallet, Jr., the son of a wealthy Long Island businessman who had attended Dartmouth College. He had been radicalized by the 1927 executions of Sacco and Vanzetti, and had joined the Communist Party of America in 1929. He had been involved in the International Unemployment Day protest in Chicago on 6 March 1930 that had been brutally repressed by the authorities, and was currently working as a union organizer with the steel workers in Youngstown, Ohio. At one point he ran for mayor of Youngstown on the Communist Party ticket, but was not elected. Kitty's parents had moved to Claygate, southwest of London, where her father represented a Chicago-based firm. On returning to the United States on 3 August 1934 after visiting family in Europe, she moved in with Dallet, becoming his common-law wife. They shared a room in a dilapidated boarding house that cost $5 per month. Gus Hall and John Gates had a room down the hall. They lived on the dole, $12.50 per month each, while Dallet protested against it. As the wife of a party member, Kitty was allowed to join the Communist Party, but only after proving her loyalty by hawking copies of the Daily Worker on the streets. Her party dues were 10c a week. They separated in June 1936, and Kitty went to live with her parents in Claygate, where she found some work as a German-to- English translator. Months went by without any word from Dallet, until Kitty discovered that her mother had been hiding his letters to her. \\"Her mother,\\" her friend Anne Wilson recalled, \\"was a real dragon, a very repressive woman. She disappeared one day over the side of a transatlantic ship, and nobody missed her. That says it all.\\" The last letter from Dallet said that he was heading to Spain on the to join the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty met up with Dallet and his best friend Steve Nelson in Cherbourg, and they travelled to Paris together. After a few days there, she returned to London, and they headed south, to cross into Spain where he joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a unit made up of American and Canadian volunteers. Kitty wanted to join Dallet in Spain, and finally secured permission to do so; but her trip to Spain was delayed by her hospitalization for an operation on 26 August 1937 for what was initially thought to be appendicitis, but which was determined to be ovarian cysts, which were removed by the German doctors. Kitty returned to England to recuperate. Before she could set out for Spain, the news arrived that Dallet had been killed in action on 17 October 1937. His letters to her were published as Letters from Spain by Joe Dallet, American Volunteer, to his Wife (1938). Kitty went to see Nelson, who was in Paris, having been wounded in August, and they returned to New York, where she stayed with Nelson and his wife Margaret at their home in Brooklyn for two months. She then headed for Philadelphia to see her friend Zelma Baker, who worked at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. Kitty enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. It was there that she met Richard Stewart Harrison, a medical doctor with degrees from Oxford University, who was completing his internship in the United States. They were married on 23 November 1938. Romance with Oppenheimer Soon after, Harrison left for Pasadena, California, for his residency at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), while Kitty completed her bachelor's degree in botany at the University of Pennsylvania, and was offered a postgraduate research fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles. At Caltech, Harrison worked with the physicist Charles Lauritsen; the X-Ray laboratory at Caltech used for physics research was also used for experimental cancer therapy research. It was at a garden party thrown by Lauritsen and his wife Sigrid in August 1939 that Kitty met Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who taught at Caltech for part of each year. Soon after, Kitty began an affair with Robert. They were frequently seen about town in his Chrysler coupe. Robert had dated several women since his break up with long-time girlfriend Jean Tatlock, some of them married, like Kitty. At Christmas time she went up to Berkeley without her husband, to spend time with Robert. His friend Haakon Chevalier met Kitty at a holiday dinner party thrown by the pianist Estelle Caen, one of Robert's ex-girlfriends. Robert invited Harrison and Kitty to spend the summer at his New Mexico ranch, Perro Caliente. Harrison declined, as he was engaged in his research, but Kitty accepted. Robert Serber and his wife Charlotte collected Kitty in Pasadena, and drove her to Perro Caliente, where they met up with Robert, his brother Frank Oppenheimer, and his wife Jackie. The Serbers had met Kitty before, at Charlotte Serber's parents' house in Philadelphia in 1938. The Oppenheimers loved to ride through the pine and birch forests and floral meadows of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, camping with minimal food and equipment. Kitty impressed them with her riding ability; horsemanship was a normal accomplishment for women of her social class, and she had learned to ride as a girl on the riding trails around Aspinwall. Kitty and Robert rode out to stay the night with his friend Katy Page in Los Pinos, New Mexico. The following day Page rode to Perro Caliente on her bay horse to return Kitty's night gown, which had been left under Robert's pillow. Kitty later told Anne Wilson that she got Robert to marry her the \\"old-fashioned way\\"‚Äîby getting pregnant. In September 1940, Robert phoned Harrison with the happy news, and they agreed that the best way forward was for Kitty to get a divorce so she could marry Robert. Soon after, Robert shared a podium with Nelson to raise money for refugees from the Spanish Civil War, and he informed him that he was engaged to Kitty. Nelson's wife was also pregnant, and he named his daughter, who was born in November 1940, Josie in memory of Dallet. To obtain a divorce, Kitty moved to Reno, Nevada, where she stayed for six weeks to meet the state's residency requirements. The divorce was finalised on November 1, 1940, and Kitty married Robert the following day in a civil ceremony in Virginia City, Nevada, with the court janitor and clerk as witnesses. Manhattan Project Their child, a son they called Peter, was born in Pasadena, on May 12, 1941, during Robert's regular session at Caltech. When they returned to Berkeley, he bought a new house at One Eagle Hill with a view over the Golden Gate. Kitty worked at the University of California as a laboratory assistant. They left Peter with the Chevaliers and a German nurse and headed out to Perro Caliente for the summer. The holiday was marred when Robert was trampled by a horse, and Kitty was injured when she had an accident in their Cadillac convertible. The United States entered World War II in December 1941, and Robert began recruiting staff for the Manhattan Project. Among the first were the Serbers, who moved into the apartment over the garage at One Eagle Hill. On March 16, 1943, the couple boarded a train for Santa Fe, New Mexico. By the end of the month, they had moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where they occupied one of the buildings formerly belonging to the Los Alamos Ranch School. Los Alamos was known to the occupants as \\"the Hill\\" and to the Manhattan Project as Site Y. Robert became the director of Project Y. Kitty abdicated the role of post commander's wife to Martha Parsons, the wife of Robert's deputy, Navy Captain William S. Parsons. She put her biologist training to use working for the director of the Health Group at Los Alamos, Louis H. Hempelmann, conducting blood tests to assess the danger of radiation. In 1944, Kitty became pregnant again. Her second child, a girl Katherine who she named after her mother but called Toni, was born on December 7, 1944. Like other babies born in wartime Los Alamos, Toni's birth certificate gave the place of birth as P.O. Box 1663. In April 1945, Kitty was depressed by the isolation of Los Alamos, and she left Toni with Pat Sherr, the wife of physicist Rubby Sherr; Pat had recently lost her son, Michael, to SIDS. Kitty returned with Peter to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to live with her parents. They returned to Los Alamos in July 1945. Later life With the end of the war in August 1945, Robert had become a celebrity, and Kitty had become an alcoholic. She suffered a series of bone breaks from drunken falls and car crashes. In November 1945, Robert left Los Alamos to return to Caltech, but he soon found that his heart was no longer in teaching. In 1947, he accepted an offer from Lewis Strauss to take up the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. The job came with rent-free accommodation in the director's house, a ten-bedroom 17th-century manor with a cook and groundskeeper, surrounded by of woodlands. Robert had a greenhouse built for Kitty, where she raised orchids; for her birthdays Robert had rare species flown in from Hawaii. Olden Manor was sometimes known as \\"Bourbon Manor\\"; Kitty and Robert liked to keep the liquor cabinet well stocked, and like many of their generation, liked to celebrate cocktail hour with martinis, Manhattans, Old Fashioneds and highballs. Both were also fond of smoking, and Kitty's habit of combining too much alcohol with smoking in bed led to a plethora of holes in her bedding and at least one house fire. She sometimes took too many pills, and suffered from abdominal pains caused by pancreatitis. Pain often prompted outbursts of anger. In 1952, Toni came down with polio, and doctors suggested that a warmer climate might help. The family flew down to the Caribbean, where they rented a ketch. Robert and Kitty discovered a mutual love of sailing, while Toni soon recovered. Henceforth, the family would spend part of each summer on Saint John in the Virgin Islands, eventually building a beach house there. On January 6, 1967, Robert was diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and he died on February 18, 1967. Kitty had his remains cremated and his ashes were placed in an urn, which she took to St. John and dropped them into the sea off the coast, within sight of the beach house. She took up with Robert Serber, whose wife Charlotte had committed suicide in May 1967. She talked him into buying a yawl, which they sailed from New York to Grenada. In 1972, they purchased a ketch, with the intention of sailing through the Panama Canal and to Japan via the Galapagos Islands and Tahiti. They set out, but Kitty became ill, and was taken to Gorgas Hospital, where she died of an embolism on October 27, 1972. Serber and Toni had her remains cremated, and they scattered her ashes near Robert's.

On the recommendation of Betty Rogers, Will Rogers' wife, the sculptor Jo Davidson was awarded the commission.Kuhn, Lois Harris, The World of Jo Davidson, illustrated by Leonard everett Fisher, The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1958 p. 133. Davidson and Rogers had known each other for a number of years, during which time Davidson had frequently attempted to convince Rogers to pose for him, and Rogers had always put it off, referring to Davidson as ‚Äúyou old head-hunter.‚ÄùDavidson, Jo, Between Sittings: An Informal Autobiography of Jo Davidson, The Dial Press, New York, 1951 p. 298. Davidson prepared for the commission by requesting Fox Films, for whom Rogers had made many films, (Rogers had acted in dozens of movies, 50 silent and 21 sound) to loan him films that he then screened in his Paris studio, where Davidson ‚Äúworked, talked and lived nothing but Will Rogers‚Äù. He next procured the service of a model built roughly like Rogers and modeled him in clay, nude. He then asked Mrs. Rogers to send him some of Rogers worn clothes, which ‚Äústill contained his personality,‚Äù which she did, and they were modeled on the nude clay. When he had completed the life-sized clay model, he made a plaster cast and sent it to the Valsuani foundry in Paris, where two casts were made, one for the National Statuary Hall Collection and the other for the Will Rogers Memorial, then recently opened in Claremore, Oklahoma, near Rogers birthplace. When that statue was unveiled, president Franklin Delano Roosevelt broadcast a message live on coast-to-coast radio from his home in Hyde Park. The plaster cast was returned to the US and donated to the Will Rogers Memorial Fund, a charity established by the movie industry as a tribute to Will Rogers, in 1936. The WRMF was an eventual replacement for the National Vaudeville Artist Fund, which operated social assistance programs and a hospital for vaudevillians suffering from tuberculosis. The hospital was in Saranac Lake, New York and often referred to as the NVA Lodge. As a result of an agreement between vaudeville producers and movie moguls, the hospital name was changed to the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital, where the plaster cast was on display until the hospital closed in 1974. After the hospital closed, a research and teaching lab was established, called the Will Rogers Institute, at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, in White Plains, New York, where the cast was on display until it was moved to Los Angeles in 1997. The plaster cast was restored in 2004 by Irena Calinescu, Objects Conservator, and is among the secure holdings of the Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation, the new name of WRMF, as of 2002.

Location Lislaughtin Abbey is located north of Ballylongford, on the east bank of the Ballylongford Creek and to the south of the Shannon Estuary. History The friary was founded for the Order of Friars Minor (Observant Franciscan Friars) in 1470 by John O'Connor, Lord of Kerry Luachra and Iraghticonnor. Permission was granted by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477. It was named after Saint Lachtin (died AD 622) who brought Christianity to the area. A silver processional cross was commissioned in 1479; it is now known as the Lislaughtin or Ballymacasey cross and is held at the National Museum of Ireland ‚Äì Archaeology. Side view of the abbey: church on left and refectory/dormitory on the right Lord Iraghticonnor was buried at the friary in 1485. Thomas fitz Gerald, heir of the Knight of Glin, was buried there in 1567 after his execution. During the Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle (1580) the abbey was twice raided by English soldiers. The abbey was then dissolved, although the church and graveyard remained in use by the local Catholic population, and some friars returned in 1629. During one of these attacks the Lislaughtin cross was buried for safety, and it was found by a local farmer in March 1871. Buildings Interior of the ruins The abbey church is a long house divided into choir and nave with triple sedilia; the collapsed square tower was over the choir arch. The thirty windows are pointed and of cut limestone. A two-storey building contained refectory and dormitory. To the northeast is the garderobe.

Boughton Caroline Greenhank Boughton (August 9, 1854 - 1905) was an American educator and philanthropist. Early life Caroline Greenhank was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 9, 1854. She was the second daughter of Judge Thomas Greenbank of that city, whose family was of English extraction, a family devout and scholarly, represented in each generation by divines and jurists of superior order. Through her mother, she was related to a branch of the north of Ireland gentry, the Huestons of Belfast. Greenhank graduated from the Philadelphia Normal School in 1874, fifth in a class of eighty. Career In the autumn of 1874, Caroline G. Boughton began her career as a teacher in Miss Steven's Seminary, Germantown, Philadelphia. In 1878 she took charge of the department of history in the Philadelphia Normal School, which position she filled for four years, winning by her talents and enthusiasm an enviable reputation in her profession, and by her charming manners the affectionate regard of all who came under her influence. Boughton, in her connection with the American Home Missionary Society of the M. E. Church, became especially interested in Indian Missions and was early chosen a manager of the Women's National Indian Association, a position she filled during five years. That office she exchanged later for that of auditor of the association. New Century Club, Philadelphia She was an active member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union until failing health obliged her to curb her energies in that direction. Boughton was always deeply interested in the advancement of women. She was a member of the New Century Club (Philadelphia), and was also a member of the National Woman Suffrage Association, and an earnest advocate of the principles which that body represented.

Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, USA, the BayEcotarium is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to protecting, restoring and inspiring conservation of the San Francisco Bay, from the Sierra to the sea. Formerly known as bay.org, the BayEcotarium is an amalgam of six unique institutions located throughout the Bay area. These six institutions‚Äîthe Aquarium of the Bay, the Sea Lion Center, the Bay Institute, Studio Aqua, the Bay Model Alliance and the Bay Academy‚Äîall focus on different aspects of San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta conservation. The BayEcotarium is committed to conservation education and provides free field trips to over 25,000 Bay Area students every year. These excursions are designed to teach students and teachers about the San Francisco Bay, its ecosystems, and its environmental challenges. The BayEcotarium uses classroom education, community outreach and live animal exhibitry to interpret topics like sustainable seafood, protecting marine areas, plastic pollution, climate change, and watershed health.  History  The Bay Institute, a Bay Area conservation organization, acquired the Aquarium of the Bay in 2009.Fimrite, Peter (11 June 2009). \\"Nonprofit to buy aquarium at Pier 39\\".

Highlights include two 150-ft. walk-through acrylic tunnels and a North American river otter display. The Bay Institute Founded in 1981, The Bay Institute is the research and advocacy arm of the Bay Ecotarium. The greater Bay ecosystem covers nearly 40% of California‚Äôs land area. It encompasses the inland delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the Central Valley streams, the Suisun Marsh, the San Francisco Bay itself, and the coastal waters of the Gulf of the Farallones. Using a combination of scientific research, political advocacy, and public education, the Institute focuses on the water management and economic policies necessary to ensure the health of the greater San Francisco Bay. Studio Aqua Driven by the growing gap in climate and ocean messaging, Studio Aqua is a mission driven strategic studio anchored in generating visual vocabulary to engage, educate and experience an environmental movement designed to inspire. The studio is integral to the BayEcotarium and works in tandem with its divisions located in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's primarily programmed to meet the interpretive planning and exhibit design requirements of the BayEcotarium and in addition offers design services to clients in the aquarium, zoos and aqua-themed endeavors from art to installation. The Bay Model Alliance The Bay Model Alliance is a comprehensive learning center focused on San Francisco Bay. The centerpiece of the Alliance is the Bay Model Visitor Center. Located in Sausalito, CA, the Visitor Center is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in conjunction with the Bay Ecotarium, and showcases a working 1.5-acre model of the San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta system. The walk-through model allows visitors to observe tidal action, and visualize currents and eddies as they would actually occur in the Bay, rivers, tributaries, and Delta. The Sea Lion Center The Sea Lion Center offers free educational programs about the California sea lions at PIER 39‚Äôs K-Dock. Using presentations and interactives, the Center interprets the colony of wild California sea lions now permanently established in this unusual urban location. The educational emphasis concentrates on the natural history of California sea lions, their history at PIER 39 and the environmental threats they currently face. Over a million tourists visit K-Dock a year. The Bay Academy The Bay Academy consolidates and archives all Bay Institute and other educational Bay-focused publications, citations and editorials into a cohesive, easily accessible database. Production is underway to publish a series of Bay Eco books, both in print and as eBooks.

The family was founded by Neo-Aleksandr I von Valdimiroff, the issue of Yevdokiya Yusupova and Peter von Biron, although the pair officially had no children. As Peter von Biron's first child, many view Neo-Aleksandr I von Vladimiroff and the family as the rightful inheritors of his estate. The faction are the last known pretenders to the Duchy of Courland and Semigalia.  History  The founder of the house, Neo-Aleksandr I von Valdimiroff, was the child of Yevdokiya Yusupova and Peter von Biron and is only mentioned by the Dukes third wife Dorothea von Medem in her private letters. The Duchess wrote about the child on very few occasions and expressed her loathing for him. The Duke and third Duchess had the boy baptized as a Lutheran, but it infuriated his father and stepmother that he never renounced the Orthodox Church. Neo-Aleksandr went on to found the House of Vladimiroff by marrying into the House of Mecklenburg (resulting in Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg assuming power after the treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a result of the Mecklenburg connection to the Duchy). The House of Vladimiroff has faded into relative obscurity as no nation has ever been governed by family, however due to their unique lineage they have married into almost every great dynasty of Europe (including the Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Romanov and Saxe-Coburg). Despite the family possessing the last legitimate claim to both the Kingdom of Livonia (German: Livland, Latvian: Vidzeme), and being the last remaining Baltic German ruling dynasty, they were neither given the crown of Courland or the United Baltic Duchy due to their loyalty to the Russian Empire and Romanovs. In 1942 the Schutzstaffel (SS) accepted Kyrill XIII von Vladimroff (Russian: –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª XIII –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤), the last surviving member of the Vladimiroff Dynasty, into the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade (later the 19th Waffen SS Division). He served throughout the war during the Siege of Leningrad, the Tannenburg Line and finally in the Kurland Pocket. On the 17th of May 1945 Swedish Nazis recorded his entry onto Gotland with approximately 30 other SS soldiers, after which the group went to Sweden. Kyrill XIII went on to America and married a Bavarian Junker, Isabella von K√∂ntopf (Isabella I von Vladimiroff), who was fleeing Germany as a result of the war. Kyrill XIII initially changed his last name to von K√∂ntopf, and later Americanized it to Kentopp, in order to avoid war crime charges in the Soviet Union. The marriage produced one child named Kyrill Kentopp (Kyrill XIV von Vladimiroff).  Family Traditions  The von Vladimiroffs are a purely Orthodox Christian family, and those who do not strictly adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church or speak Baltic German are expelled from the House of Vladimiroff in order to retain Russo-Teutonic heritage. This strict policy has resulted in problems and near extinctions for the house, for example Kyrill XIII von Vladimroff (Russian: –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª XIII –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤) was the only living member of the family for a number of years. This has also resulted in compromises with other houses, as children produced from the family are often baptized as Catholic or Lutheran, however this negates their ability to inherit certain titles. A notable family tradition is that despite differing Christian names, all of the inheriting men in the family are named to as Kyrill while inheriting women are named Kyra. It is not known why this is the case. Despite only happening twice, it is acceptable for members of the family to possess a double-barreled first name which includes Kyrill, such as Ludwig-Kyrill I von Vladimiroff the current prince of Livonia. In the case of a female of the House of Vladimiroff inheriting any title, it is immediately passed on to the son of her choice upon his sixteenth birthday, however the choice is often relinquished to the current head of the family. The family motto is \\"Kings of the Land, Fathers of the People\\" (Russian: –ö–æ—Ä–æ–ª–∏ –∑–µ–º–ª–∏, –æ—Ç—Ü—ã –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞, German: K√∂nige des Landes, V√§ter des Volkes, Latvian: Zemes kari, tautas tƒìvi).  Present Day  As of 2017, living members of the house only include the children of Kyrill XIV von Vladimiroff, and his two children Kyrill XV and Kyra II (officially Kyrill Kentopp Jnr. and Kyra Kentopp). Kyrill XV, pretender to the Kingdom of Livonia, has one child, Ludwig-Kyrill I von Vladimiroff (Kyrill XV abandoned the name of Kentopp), second in line to the throne of Livonia. Kyra II von Vladimiroff married a descendant of the Rurikid dynasty and had three children, the oldest being Timur von Vladimiroff (Teymor Buckley, baptized a Catholic), and the youngest being Kyra-Trinity von Vladimiroff (Kyra-Trinity Kentopp). In 2016, upon his 16th birthday, the middle child Leopold I von Rurik (Neo-Aleksandr Leopold Kyrill von Vladimiroff, Neo Buckley) was granted all the titles possessed by his mother, significantly the Vladimiroff title of Duke of Courland and Semigalia. Moreover, through his father Leopold I von Rurik holds the title of Bejewelled Prinz (Prince of Ukraine), leaving the crown of Ukraine in the House of Vladimiroff.

The William Freeman Myrick Goss Library of the History of Engineering.  Biography   Youth and education  Goss was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts as son of Franklin B. Goss and Mary Gorham (Parker) Goss. His father had been owner and editor of The Barnstable Patriot, and his two elder brothers followed into his footsteps. At early age Goss had developed an interest in engineering, and build model steam engines from scrap in his father's print shop. He maintained the prime mover in the shop, and installed a steam engine in a small boat at the age of 17. In 1877 Goss was among the first students of a new two year practical mechanics course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course was built on a Russian system of instruction, introduced at the Centennial Exposition a year earlier. It was focussed on the production system instead of manual training, lectures on college level, and exercised to design saleable article of furniture, or tools. Goss completed the course in two years.  Early career  After his graduation at MIT in 1879, Goss was appointed instructor in mechanics at Purdue University. In the next decade Goss taught practical mechanics, developed instruction for shop work, and was appointed the first professor of practical mechanics at Purdue University. After a six months leave-of-absence in 1888-89, Goss was appointed professor of experimental mechanics at Purdue University and founded its engineering laboratory. In 1899 Goss took a nine month leave-of-absence studying theory and practice in Europe in England, Germany and France. Afterwards he continued his academic work at Purdue University. From 1907 to 1917 he was Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, and in between served at the Chicago Association of Commerce directing studies on Smoke Abatement and Electrification of Railway Terminals. In the last years of his career Goss was president of the American Railway Car Manufacturers Association. Goss was awarded an Honorary Master of Arts from Wabash College in 1888, and a Doctor of Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1904. In the year 1913-14 he served as President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Over the years he authored a series of engineering books and over 100 papers.

It killed 7 of the 45 people on board, the remaining 38 were rescued.  Background  The trip was a reenactment of log rafting. In the Northeast United States particularly North Eastern, Central Pennsylvania where the logging boom was strongest. Multiple local men decided to hold a memorial rafting trip from Clearfield County to Harrisburg. The men who had done the trip twice before in years past to honor the logging industry in the area agreed on a 1935 trip being their last, however some of the group decided to do it one last time in 1938. Thus why it is also known as The Last Raft Tragedy. The Raft was launched on March 14 at McGee's Mill in western Clearfield County. The 200 mile trip was expected to take a week and a half to complete. In the beginning there were six experienced rafters on board. They tied off multiple times for food, rest and to meet the crowd which began forming along the river-side. The 112 x 25 foot Raft picked up dozens at Lock Haven and Williamsport.  Accident  The Raft about six days into its trip on March 20 entered Muncy with 45 people on board. The Raft which was over 100 feet long was very hard to maneuver. It was approaching the Reading-Halls Station Bridge when people who were standing on the bridge began yelling and shouting at the rafters to try an avoid the pier. The Raft struck one of the pillars and all but two of the 45 people on board were thrown into the river. Hundreds of people were on the bridge watching the Raft when it struck it, many jumped into the river to try and save the rafters. The water was a temperature 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Many of the deaths drowned as most on board couldn't swim very well. Two of the seven bodies were never found.

However, in 1841, Harrison and 57 congregants broke off to found a new Congregationalist church, leaving a small number of Presbyterians behind. The congregation began constructing a new building, but ran out of funds, and it was not until 1843 that the new Congregationalist Church construction was complete. However, Jackson was a growing city, and the influx of new residents also added to the Congregationalist church, which had expanded to 222 members by 1850. By 1858, the church was actively involved in planning for a new building. In 1858, the church purchased two lots on which to construct a new building. The next year, they hired Syracuse architect Horatio Nelson White to design the building and contracted with James Morwick, also of Syracuse, to construct it. Construction of the Congregational Church began in early 1859, and the church was dedicated on October 18, 1860. However, the church congregation continued to grow. By 1871, the Congregationalists needed even more space, particularly for a meeting hall and Sunday school rooms. To gain more space, the entire building was raised eight feet, and a lower section built underneath. In 1895, a new entryway was added to the church. The original parsonage was removed some time in the late 1940s, and in 1960 a new modern addition was constructed as a Christian Education Wing. As of 2019, the First Congregational Church still uses the building. Description The First Congregational Church is a large reddish brown brick Romanesque Revival structure, with a modern two-story brick addition on one side. The original building sits on a stone foundation and is topped with a gabled roof clad with asphalt shingles. The center section of the facade, containing the entryway, projects forward, forming an entryway with a slate covered gable roof. A recessed, round-arch door is within the entryway. The projecting section is flanked by two massive, distinctly different towers. The towers are similar at their bases, but one if taller than the other, extending four sections to the shorter one's two. There are round-headed stained glass windows on either side of the church, which are original to the building. The modern two-story addition is a brown brick structure accented with burgundy enameled metal panels. It sits on a concrete foundation and has a flat roof.

The company allows users to request the services of a massage therapist. Since its launch in 2014, the mostly mobile app-based company has received significant press coverage and has expanded its service area to include many cities and counties in the United States. It also provides services in Australia, Canada, the UK, and Germany.  History  Soothe was founded in August 2013. It was created by Merlin Kauffman, CEO & cofounder, and Bradley Herman, former CTO & cofounder. Kauffman developed the idea behind the service while studying at the Harvard Business School. He was a domain- name investor who started as a teenager. As an adult, he invested four hundred thousand of his own money to start the business. The company first began operating in the Los Angeles area where it was based. It also has a second headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada. As of December 2014, the service had 300 licensed massage therapists in Los Angeles and also covered Austin, Miami, Orange County, Phoenix and San Diego. In August 2015, the company received $10.6 million in funding from The Riverside Company. By this point, the company had expanded to a total of 13 cities which included Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco. In its March 2016 Series B funding, the company raised an additional $35 million. It had expanded to twenty-two areas in the US, including Atlanta and Indianapolis. Soothe had a total of more than 3,200 massage therapists across the nation. It also operates at a loss and planned to continue to do so ‚Äúfor the foreseeable future‚Äù. However, the company reported a monthly revenue of $1.2 million as of March 2016. As of April 2016, Soothe‚Äôs coverage area also included such cities as Houston, Minneapolis, Orlando, and Portland. It had also expanded services to Canada by including Vancouver, British Columbia. The company also began servicing in Europe with London becoming the first city across the Atlantic. In July 2016, the company has signed-up corporate clients like Facebook, Hulu, and Microsoft. According to the company, the move was partly motivated by a desire to smooth-out demand and mitigate the spike in service requests outside of the regular nine to five corporate business hours. By February 2017, the service was available in 51 cities in the US while also adding services to Toronto, Canada. In summer 2017, the company launched two locations in Australia by expanding its services to Sydney and Melbourne.

She first appeared in Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #1 (November 2015) and was created by Brandon Montclare and Amy Reeder. Lunella is a 9-year-old girl who is described as the smartest character in the existing Marvel Universe. Somewhat replacing Moon-Boy, she is paired up with Devil Dinosaur, with whom she shares a mental link due to being an Inhuman. Publication history The character was created by writers Brandon Montclare and Amy Reeder (who also designed the character), and artist Natacha Bustos, first appearing in Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #1 (November 2015). The genesis of the character came from editor Mark Paniccia, who is a fan of the character Devil Dinosaur and, along with editor Emily Shaw, had hired Montclare and Reeder to pen the basis for a new series that involved the character ending up in modern day. They came up with the idea of Devil Dinosaur interacting with a girl and fell in love with the idea of working with a hero who wasn't a \\"regular cape-and-tights superhero\\". Reeder explains the primary inspiration for the creation of the character: They also viewed the series as a direct sequel to the Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur series from Jack Kirby, hence the first villains that Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur face are the Killer-Folk. Artist Natacha Bustos found the character a relief from the norm of other typical superheroes. She was primarily inspired by the clear diversity that Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur promoted, further comparing the character Lunella to herself. She compared her story to a \\"Ghibli one\\" due to the immense relationship between the title characters. Issue 47 of Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur (released November 2019) has been billed as the final issue of the series. Fictional character biography Heroic beginnings Lunella Lafayette is a young African-American girl who daydreams and loves to invent. Despite possessing an astoundingly large intellect, she is unable to get into better schools and attends Public School 20 Anna Silver. Her classmates make fun of her and dub her Moon Girl because of these qualities. In the Savage Land, a group of Killer Folk got their hands on the sacred Nightstone. Moon Boy and Devil Dinosaur fought to reclaim it, but Moon Boy died as the Killer Folk were sucked into a vortex through time with the Nightstone. Moon Boy's dying wish was for Devil Dinosaur to reclaim the Nightstone and to avenge him.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #1 Going through the portal, Devil Dinosaur ended up in New York City. The Nightstone had fallen into the hands of Lunella;who deduced the Nightstone was actually a Kree Omni- Wave Projector. Lunella had identified the Inhuman gene within her own DNA and feared being transformed into a monster due to the changes brought about by Terrigen Mist. Due to several Terrigen clouds that had been drifting around the city following the Inhumans' detonation of a Terrigen bomb, she took drastic action and intended to use the Nightstone to find a way to remove the Inhuman DNA. With Lunella refusing to give up the Nightstone, Devil Dinosaur was forced to bring her on his rampage through the city as he searched for the Killer Folk. Although Devil Dinosaur fought the Killer Folk, they managed to escape with the Nightstone.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #2 Lunella ended up harboring Devil Dinosaur in her laboratory that she had built in the depths of her school, growing more and more frustrated that she was stuck with the \\"big red dummy\\" but found him useful when he helped save the lives of her teacher and class during a fire.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #3 However, the Hulk (Amadeus Cho) arrived, seeking to apprehend Devil Dinosaur for his earlier rampage and accused him of the fire. Lunella refused, declaring that she needed Devil Dinosaur and, growing frustrated with Amadeus patronizing her and undermining her intelligence, drew out a few homemade weapons to fight him, but only accidentally ended up knocking out Devil Dinosaur.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #4 Lunella, feeling responsible for Devil Dinosaur's arrest and, feeling kinship to the beast stuck in a place he did not belong, broke him out under the moniker of Moon Girl, a nickname the other students used to bully her.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #5 After the Killer Folk - who had conquered territory previously owned by the Yancy Street Gang - failed to kidnap Lunella from school to be their blood sacrifice to the Nightstone on a full moon, Lunella decided to end things. She and Devil Dinosaur fought the Killer Folk once more and won, reclaiming the Nightstone. Lunella hoped she could finally use it to ensure she would not transform into an Inhuman, but at that precise moment she was caught in a Terrigen cloud.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #6 After terrigenesis Devil Dinosaur took Lunella's cocoon to her lab and watched over it for several days until she hatched. Lunella was at first relieved she had not changed physically, but was dismayed to learn her Inhuman power caused her consciousness and that of Devil Dinosaur's to switch. Devil Dinosaur proceeded to make her even more ostracized at school due to freaking out in class and attacking other students whilst Lunella rampaged through the city. Eventually though they returned to normal.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #7-8 Devil Dinosaur and Moon Girl's next opponent came in the form of Kid Kree - a misunderstood Kree boy who had failed to enter the academy twice, who sought to capture an Inhuman to impress his father and make a name for himself on Earth as Captain Marvel had - who disguised himself as a new student, Marvin Ellis, in Lunella's class. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur fought Kid Kree several times,Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #9; #11-12 once being separated by Ms. Marvel, who recognized their fight as the childish squabble it was, but still entrusted Moon Girl with a device to contact her if things ever got out of hand.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #10 Lunella is then approached by Hulk, who gives her the Banner B.O.X. (Brain Omnicompetence Examiner), and is surprised when she solves it in mere seconds, proving that Lunella is the smartest person on Earth. After consulting experts, Moon Girl, Hulk and Devil Dinosaur encounter Mole Man, who was attacking the city with a group of monsters. The next day, at her lab, Lunella ends up having a vision of herself in the future, where she is approached by Earth's smartest heroes. After school, she is approached by the Thing, who takes her for a walk when Hulk appears. When the two start fighting, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur manage to contain them while protecting the civilians, until both of them are left unconscious. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom is surprised to discover that Moon Girl is considered the smartest person on Earth and vows to prove himself superior.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #13-14 During science class, Lunella is attacked by robot drones until she is saved by Riri Williams. They follow the drones to a nearby alley, where Moon Girl encounters Doctor Doom.

While walking back home, Moon Girl and two of her classmates are attacked by Doctor Doom and his Doombots. Moon Girl uses an enlargement potion on herself to help Doctor Strange fight Doom and his robots. A few nights later, while installing an energy sensing probe, Moon Girl is found by five members of the X-Men.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #16 Arriving at an abandoned mall, Moon Girl reengineers a Cerebro helmet with the Omni-Wave Projector to locate Doom, only for her and the X-Men to travel back to the 1980s. Once there, Doctor Doom arrives with an army of Doombots. The X-Men and Devil fight the Doombots until Moon Girl takes off the helmet, sending them back to the present, where they discover that Doom is actually a Doombot. Lunella takes the Doombot to her lab to analyze it.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #17 Lunella later makes a major discovery about her Inhuman power: it only activates during a full moon. She then encounters an army of Doombots, along with Thing, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Ironheart, Doctor Strange, Kid Kree and the Killer Folk, who went to her aid after being recruited by Lunella.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #18 Robot double Lunella then receives a call for help from an alien girl named Illa and, after building a spaceship, goes to space with Devil and crash lands on a moon. While exploring, Lunella discovers that Illa is the moon.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #19 She soon realizes that Illa is lonely and wants company and does not understand Lunella at all. After a brief fight between Devil and some giant bugs, Lunella leaves, despite Illa's objections. In the process, Lunella is sent to a parallel universe where she meets another version of herself and Devil Dinosaur. Meanwhile, the Doombot head creates robotic versions of Lunella to avoid suspicions of her absence.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #20 After fighting their counterparts, Devil Girl and Moon Dinosaur, Lunella and Devil get back on their spacecraft and return to Illa who tells them that they will never leave her. Back home, the Doombot head begins to have problems with one of Lunella robots. Moon Girl and Devil manage to find Ego the Living Planet and reunite him with Illa, while the Doombot discovers that the Lunella robot is acting independently.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #21-22 Meanwhile, the Doombot head has created multiple Moon Girl replacement robots who to his surprise are acting like real little girls. He tells them that they will be obsolete when the real Lunella returns. While up in space Lunella has united Ego and Illa as a family. On the way to Earth she uses the Omniwave projector to tearfully return Devil Dinosaur to Moon Boy in the Savage Land, where she thinks he belongs, and then returns to New York, where she tosses it away in the trash. Later, realizing that she still needs help, she begins checking out other superheroes in the search for a potential partner. She tries several while on various adventures, but this fails and when faced with the Super Skrull she enlists Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm and uses H.E.R.B.I.E. to relocate Devil Dinosaur and bring him back in a Fantastic Four uniform of his own. (Issue #29) They defeat Super Skrull and Lunella realizes that she and Devil Dinosaur do not belong in the Fantastic Four, but that they do belong together.

While trying to break Devil out of his cage, Moon Girl meets Leer, the Inhuman Karnak mentioned, who knocks her unconscious when the Helicarrier crash lands. Fortunately, Moon Girl and Devil have switched brains just in time, enabling Moon Girl to lead the Warriors to an Inhuman prison camp. There, the Warriors plan a jailbreak with the imprisoned Inhumans when the Underground resistance arrives to help them.

Pseudantechinus woolleyae (Woolley's false antechinus) is named for her.  Biography  Patricia Woolley was born in 1932 in Denmark, Western Australia. Her mother was a nurse and her father a medical practitioner. She completed her Junior Certificate at Albany High School. After moving to Perth, Woolley sought to study science at Perth Modern School however at that time women were not allowed to study chemistry at the school, so she attended Perth Technical College and later Leederville Technical College instead. There she focused on mathematics and through the encouragement of a teacher went on to study mathematics at the University of Western Australia. After losing interest in mathematics, Woolley switched to zoology and graduated with a BSc in 1955. After graduation Woolley worked as a research assistant under Professor Harry Waring, researching marsupials. She did experimental work with Waring until moving with her husband to Canberra in 1960. She lectured in zoology at the Australian National University before deciding to work towards a Ph.D. After completing her Ph.D. in 1966, she worked as a lecturer and associate professor at La Trobe University in Melbourne, retiring in 2000.  Scientific career  The majority of Woolley‚Äôs work focused on marsupial biology, dealing with species in both Australia and Papua New Guinea. For her Ph.D. she researched the sex differentiation in dasyurids, specifically in the Antechinus genus. One of the findings of her Ph.D. research was that certain dasyurid species are semelparous, meaning they live long enough to reproduce, and then die, which is unusual among mammals. After receiving her Ph.D., Woolley began her career as an associate professor at La Trobe University, where she was the first zoologist on the faculty. While teaching at La Trobe, she continued her research on dasyurids. In this research, she looked at penis morphology in many species of the Antechinus genus, and was able to reclassify several species that were incorrectly put in the Antechinus genus, based on a certain structure on the penis of the animal. From 1980 to 1990 Woolley traveled in Papua New Guinea in order to trap dasyurids, and observe them in the wild.  Awards and recognition  Prior to Woolley‚Äôs research little was known of dasyurids. Her findings and her studies prompted significant interest from the zoology community, and in 1988, a new species of Pseudantechinus (Woolley's false antechinus or Pseudantechinus woolleyae) was named after her recognition of her contributions to dasyurid studies.

The development sets out to achieve high levels of sustainability, including many photovoltaic cells to gather solar energy, low levels of car use, a district heating network with energy centre scheme, communal waste collection systems, and the recycling of rainwater for irrigation and the flushing of toilets. Architecture practices involved in the development include: WilkinsonEyre, Mole Architects, Stanton Williams, Mecanoo, Sarah Wigglesworth Architects, RH Partnership, Marks Barfield Architects, MUMA, Maccreanor Lavington, and Witherford Watson Mann.  Eddington  Eddington is the name given by developers to a local centre in the North West Cambridge Development, after Cambridge astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, who led an expedition to the island of Pr√≠ncipe to photograph the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 and verify Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is part of Phase I of the North West Cambridge Development, and combines the Castle Ward in the north-west of the city, and Girton parish of South Cambridgeshire district. In 2018, a very large Roman villa was excavated on the site of Eddington, next to its Park & Ride scheme.http://www.archaeology.co.uk Eddington is centred around Market Square, with a Sainsbury's supermarket. Its one school, the University of Cambridge Primary School, opened in 2015, occupies a toroidal building ‚Äì shaped like a Polo mint ‚Äì by Marks Barfield. The Storey's Field community centre and nursery is adjacent and was nominated for the 2018 Stirling Prize. Graduate students of Girton College are housed at Swirles Court. An energy centre provides a district heating system, while a sustainable urban drainage system channels rainwater via bioswales to the artificial Brook Leys lake between the site and the M11 motorway. The water is pumped back into homes for washing through a non-potable network. The Fata Morgana Tea House by German artists Wolfgang Winter and Berthold H√∂rbelt sits on the western bank of Brook Leys lake. Except for the roof, almost the entire two-storey pavilion, including built-in benches, was made from undulating stainless steel welded grating. Depending on light conditions, its polished surfaces can appear shiny or see-through.

Madingley Road Park and Ride lies to the south of Eddington. The Ridgeway, a cycle and pedestrian path runs through the site from Girton to Storey's Way. Eddington has road access to Madingley Road on its south side and Huntingdon Road on the north-east side.

Background During the post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion of the late 1940s and the 1950s, many persons from rural and urban backgrounds moved to single-family detached homes in the suburbs or in horizontally developed cities. It was not uncommon for some of these homes to have a picture window, in contrast to the smaller sash windows typical of urban and rural housing; although many of these new suburban homes did not necessarily have picture windows, Keats in his title used the term to characterize this new housing in general, and by extension the new social forms arising from this change in how people housed themselves (as well as other social changes of the time, such as those stemming from the popular adoption of television). Keats's thesis Keats, in this his first book, took at dim view of the social changes brought on by the influx of population to the suburbs. According to Keats, this new mode of living entailed both physical inadequacies and psychological disadvantages. Builders of housing developments offered no-down-payment options which baited people to become overly indebted for homes often poorly designed, cheaply made, and soul- numbingly identical. At the same time, the social alienation of these neighborhoods, engendered by the replacement of the local markets with the supermarket, the inward-turning impetus of the television, and other changes, takes a psychological toll on the new suburbanites. Keats' uses the travails of the fictional couple John and Mary Drone to illustrate how the segregation of young couples of similar background, income bracket, and outlooks into homogeneous neighborhoods make for a stultifying unnatural community. Surrounded by neighbors but not true friends, they try to ameliorate their plight with gadgets such as televisions‚Äîwhich sinks them deeper into debt‚Äîor various activities including neighborhood sex. Keats critique is sometimes acerbic, as when he claims that \\"whole square miles of identical boxes are spreading like gangrene\\" across America because for nothing down \\"other than a simple two percent and a promise to pay, and pay, and pay until the end of your life\\" a person can \\"find a box of your own in one of the fresh-air slums\\" being built, \\"developments conceived in error, nurtured by greed, corroding everything they touch\\" which besides their effect to \\"destroy established cities and trade patterns [and] pose dangerous problems for the areas they invade\\" also even \\"actually drive mad myriads of housewives shut up in them\\". The Crack in the Picture Window was one of several critiques of 1950s American suburbia published around this time, such as Auguste Spectorsky's The Exurbanites (1955) and Richard Yates's fictional indictment of suburbia, Revolutionary Road (1961). Ginia Bellafante described The Crack in the Picture Window as \\"the book version\\" of the 1962 protest song Little Boxes.

Xenddi, sometimes spelled as Xendi, was a discriminatory religious tax imposed on Hindus by the colonial era Portuguese Christian government in 17th-century Goa. It was similar to the discriminatory Jizya religious tax imposed on Hindus by Muslim rulers in the region. The term Xenddi also spelled Xendim or Xendy meant \\"hair tuft\\", a slang for the top-knot hair style of Hindus, likely derived from the Marathi word Sendi or Shendi. The discriminatory Xenddi tax on the Hindu artisans and merchants was higher than on the Hindu peasants in Portuguese colonies in India. The Xenddi tax was not payable by those who converted from Hinduism to Christianity. In its initial formulation, the tax was introduced with the pretext that Hindus did not own any land in Goa and only the Christians did. Land revenues were paid by the Portuguese Christians in Goa, and the regional Church argued that Xenddi tax would make Hindus pay their fair share. The tax and the tax rate on Hindus evolved to be an abusive form of religious discrimination. According to Rene Berendse, the Xenddi tax was considered to be an example of religious intolerance by the neighboring Maratha Empire, and its local leader Govind Das Pant made abolishment of the discriminatory tax against the Hindus as a condition for a mutual armistice agreement. The Goan government initially refused, stating that the Xenddi tax was a matter of the Church, which the Portuguese state cannot interfere in. Expanded to all of Portuguese colonies in the Indian subcontinent by 1705, the Xenddi tax was abolished in 1840, with J.J. Lopes de Lima ‚Äì the Governor General of Goa declaring it to be \\"cruel, hateful tribute and ridiculous capitation tax\\" on the Hindus. The tax was initially imposed only on Hindus, but in later stages expanded on Indian Muslims in Goa. The tax was oppressive and arbitrary, its collection based on severe extortions and abuses, according to Teotonio R. De Souza. The discriminatory taxes were one of the many religiously targeted practices of the Portuguese clergy, states Aniruddha Ray, along with the prohibition on Hindus in Goa from observing their religious festivals. This led to widespread emigration of Hindus out of Goa and in other cases to conversion.

At the 2020 general election, Hipango was defeated in Whanganui by Labour's Steph Lewis by a margin of 6,800 votes, and her 21st ranking on the National party list was too low to return to parliament via the list. However, her ranking means she is first in line should a vacancy arise in a National list seat during the 53rd Parliament.

It opened as the New Park Theatre in 1874, and was in use until 1882 when it burned down and was never rebuilt as a theatre. Description The theatre stood on a plot of land 60 x 100 feet (20 x 30 meters). The fa√ßade was \\"plain and substantial, rather than ornamental.\\" It was made of Philadelphia brick with trimmings of Nova Scotia stone. The auditorium was 60 x 60 feet (20 x 20 m) with a parquet or orchestra circle, dress circle, and gallery. There were 12 proscenium boxes, six on each side of the stage. The stage was 34 x 60 feet and 52 feet to the girders. The proscenium was 26 feet wide and 24 feet to the top of the arch. The cost of the building (exclusive of the plot of land upon which it stood) was expected to be $100,000. The color scheme in the auditorium was French gray, and gold, with lines of red for relief. History Construction Henry E. Abbey in c1896 The New Park Theatre, designed by Frederic Draper, was built on the site of a previous theatre from May 1873 ‚Äì March 1874 by Dion Boucicault and William Stuart at a cost of $100,000. They had previously been involved with the Winter Garden Theatre, which Boucicault left in 1860 and was destroyed in March 1867 in a fire which almost cost Stuart his life. An advance description of the New Park appeared in the New York Times on 31 May 1872. In July 1872 Draper, the architect, put forward an enlarged design. This included buying an adjacent plot of land, whose rightful ownership was mired in litigation. The theatre was meant to open in October 1873 but a deadlock in litigation dragged on for so long that Boucicault and Stuart cancelled the opening. In the end another suitable plot came up for sale, and work progressed. The available artistes were re-engaged. By the end of March 1874 the work was nearly complete. Opening Boucicault had been announced to be interested in the management, but withdrew just before the theatre opened: and Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager Charles Fechter to run the house.‚ÄúDeath of William Stuart‚Äù, The New York Times, December 29, 1886. The New Park Theatre opened on 13 April or 15 April 1874 with William Stuart as manager, and Fechter appearing in his own play Love's Penance, an adaptation of Le m√©decin des enfants by Count d'Avrigny. Edwin Booth, who had been with Stuart at the Winter Garden, was fairly scathing about the whole enterprise: :\\"I should like to hear of Stuart's success ‚Äì but I doubt it, for I fear Fechter is unlucky, & Stuart really possesses very little, if any theatrical business capacity. F's remarkable talents both as actor and as stage manager shd. ensure the success of any theatre ‚Äì could he be managed; otherwise I doubts the safety of any enterprise he has to do with.\\"Fechter was noted for an uncontrollable temper, and had left two or three other theatres after arguments. Love's Penance closed on May 6, 1874, and shortly after Fechter withdrew from the management and retired. Stuart suffered financial embarrassments, and the theatre may have been shut down by the Sheriff on more than one occasion.Abbey's Park Theatre. International Broadway Database.

This was followed by the Grau-Chizzola company in Charles Lecocq's Girofl√©- Girofla, and George Fawcett Rowe appeared in his own play Brass. The following season Stuart presented Mr. & Mrs. William J. Florence in Benjamin E. Woolf's The Mighty Dollar which reached its 100th performance on 13 December 1875.Woolf wrote the libretto for one of the first modern Broadway musicals, The Doctor of Alacantra. See William A.

Marsden's The Clouds early in the winter season of 1876 left him unable to carry on, and Stuart swiftly relinquished control of his theatre. Henry E. Abbey In November 1876 Henry E. Abbey took over the management of the house and renamed the New Park Theatre to Abbey's Park Theatre. Abbey was associated with John B. Schoeffel, and later with Maurice Grau in the theatrical management partnership of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau. The shows were light comedies and farces; and the theatre saw the beginning of the combination of Stuart Robson and W. H. Crane. Acts like Helena Modjeska, and Thomas W. Keene in Shakespeare (especially Richard III) performed there. Abbey put on popular successes like Our Boarding House, set in Chicago, by Leonard Grover, starring Stuart Robson, W. H. Crane and William E. Sheridan.His only stage success. Grover appeared in The Day of Days (film) (1914, lost). It opened on 29 January 1877 and played for 104 performances, running for at least eight weeks to March 1877. Among Abbey's many artistes one of the biggest names was Lotta, a light-comedy star. She was one of the highest-paid actress in America, earning sums of up to $5,000 per week. Boucicault's Dot, a dramatisation of Charles Dickens's The Cricket on the Hearth with John E.

The next day the papers implicated Langtry in the misfortune. They declared that the burning of the Park Theatre was the biggest and costliest advertisement ever designed to welcome a star to America's shores. Langtry presented Tom Taylor's An Unequal Match a week later to capacity houses at Wallack's Theatre instead. Aftermath With Abbey's theatre‚Äîand one main source of income‚Äîgone, he and Schoeffel invited Maurice Grau to join them in partnership. [NB The article says (incorrectly) that his father was Hermann Grau, and not Emmanuel.] The theatrical management firm of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau went on to lease and manage the brand-new Metropolitan Opera House (the 'Old Met') for its opening season of 1883‚Äì4. It was a critical success but a financial disaster: Abbey as manager was personally responsible for losses of $250,000. (subscription required) Disambiguation Soon after Abbey's Park Theatre burned down in October 1882, another New Park Theatre opened at 1331 Broadway in 1883. It was leased by David Belasco, who survived the 1883-1884 season with a new version of his The Stranglers of Paris, adapted from a story by Adolphe Belot. It played at his New Park Theatre on November 12, 1883. Belasco's adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin (a 'Tom show') probably also played there.

In general, the leagues are arranged into different areas, like neurology, trauma, oncology, pediatrics and cardiology. The academic leagues have similarities to the learning communities found in American and Canadian universities. However, the academic leagues are small groups, with the students responsible for the organizing and planning processes, with the assistance of a teacher. The activities occur regularly throughout the curricular semester, usually in unusual schedules, involving students from different years and even from different medical universities. The academic leagues are frequently discussed in seminars and conferences, such as Brazilian Congress of Medical Education, which promote scientific development and enable the exchange of experience between peers. Although, there is no clear concept about them.Torres Albina Rodrigues, Oliveira Gabriel Martins de, Yamamoto F√°bio Massahito, Lima Maria Cristina Pereira. Academic leagues and medical education: contributions and challenges. Interface (Botucatu) [Internet]. 2008 December [cited 2017 Oct 16]; 12 (27): 713-720.

Motivations and critics  They are extracurricular activities, so participation highlights the students' motivation to active pursuit of knowledge. The academic leagues have optional participation, being environments theoretically free of academic formalities, with a system of self-management of learning and have a mitigation of the classic hierarchical environment of the teacher-student relationship. Thus, it is understood that learning within them becomes more enjoyable. Hamamoto Filho PT. Ligas Acad√™micas: motiva√ß√µes e cr√≠ticas a prop√≥sito de um repensar necess√°rio. Rev. Bras. Educ. Med. 2011; 35(4): pp. 535-43. Some Brazilian authors, however, list critiques to the academic leagues. The possible subversion of the formal curricular structure, reproduction of academic defects, early specialization, the risk of the practice of medicine without guidance and supervision, and the emphasis on teaching and research to the detriment of university extension, reduced to specific campaigns and activities. There are many motivations that lead students to participate in an academic league: need to approach clinical practice, deficiencies in the curriculum, search for social recognition, among others. Therefore, it is to be expected that there is immense variability among the academic leagues, showing that because it is a student initiative and based on an initial problem, each group of students finds ways to deal with such problems.  Base-activities  Despite the variability, however, it is possible to note the base-activity pattern in the teaching-research- extension tripod. In general, all academic leagues have periodic programmed activities with the objective of discussing the subject of interest among the students, based on theoretical basis, in the form of classes, discussion of articles or seminars. Also, most of the leagues described participation in academic events, as listeners, lecturers or carrying out scientific papers.  Health sciences  Although the academic leagues started and is still a theme predominantly related to the medical students, they have been created in other health sciences. Sometimes, academic leagues are created to ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù problems of the curricula.  Academic leagues entities  Some specialty societies stimulate the creation of academic leagues in their area, introducing content that are not yet on the formal curriculum, and creating networks of knowledge exchange among the leagues of their area. There are other experiences of entities that congregate several academic leagues, the most notable being the Brazilian Association of Academic Leagues, founded in 2006. There is also the Brazilian Committee of Trauma Leagues, which brings together the academic leagues focused on the study of trauma and emergency medicine.Sim√µes RL, Bermudes FAM, Andrade HS, Barcelos FM, Rossoni BP, Miguel GPS, Fagundes CAC, Fraga GP.

This year will mark years of the Destin Fishing Rodeo.  History  The Rodeo began as a way for the small town to attract visitors during the shoulder season, or slow season, when tourists did not visit the beach town. The first rodeo was held in 1948 and only had a few participants. Early prizes consisted of kitchen appliances, beer, windshield wipers, and lots of land in the area. The Destin Fishing Rodeo was named a Rodeo in honor of the town‚Äôs earliest permanent fishing inhabitants. Leonard Destin, the first settler of European descent to arrive in the area, and other fishermen like him used to corral the fish that they caught in pens built in the water just like cattle corralled at a rodeo. The pens were designed to hold fish and keep them alive before live wells were commonplace. Today, prizes include vacations, fishing gear, and over $100,000 in cash prizes. After the success of the early rodeos, the event was moved to October to extend the tourist season past the warm summer months. The event worked and continues to grow in size every year. New events and attractions are added as the event grows. Categories that include newest ways to catch fish such as from paddle boards or kayaks have been added along with Shark Saturdays for weighing in some of the large sharks caught during the tournament.  Local Economic Impact  ‚ÄúIn 2006 an estimated 36,518 anglers from 27 states and 5 countries (13,421 local) participated in the Rodeo.\\" This equated in to approximately $5.2 million of revenue for the local community.  Categories  There are junior, teen, ladies, and senior divisions. Prizes are awarded daily, weekly, and overall. Specific species categories vary by year as federal and state fishing regulations change. A Rules Committee meets every year and determines all rules for angler and fish eligibility. There are over 75 rules governing the Rodeo, but the three main rules are:  General Rodeo Rules  * Anglers must declare division of entry at the time of weigh-in. * Anglers cannot win multiple awards for single fish (excluding bonus and jackpot awards). * The Destin Fishing Rodeo Rules Committee governs all activities related to angler and fish eligibility,  Weigh-Ins  The Destin Fishing Rodeo hosts daily weigh-ins from 11am CST - 7pm CST behind AJ's Seafood & Oyster Bar on the Destin Harbor.

Dating to BCE, the amphora, filled with olive oil, was the prize for a victor in the Panathenaia games in Athens. This particular amphora is a neck amphora that stands at tall.  Imagery  Like all Panathenaic prize amphorae, this vase features a portrait of Athena Promachos on one of its faces. This particular iteration of Athena leads soldiers into battle and always holds a spear in one hand, protects her body with a shield in the other hand, and has a helmet on her head. On the left side of the Athena Promachos face is the inscription \\"ton Athenethen athlon,\\" meaning \\"a prize from Athens;\\" like the image of Athena herself, this phrase appeared on all Panathenaic prize amphorae. The other face of the amphora portrays the Pankration, an event that incorporated elements of combat sports like kickboxing and wrestling. The Pankration face is particularly unique for its inclusion of both the athletes competing in the event and an onlooking judge; art historians suggest that the appearance of the judge emphasizes how dangerous the event was, as it lacked true rules and regulations. Both faces of the amphora have a single zone or register portraying the figurative scene. The majority of the remainder of the body is painted black, with red detailing around the neck and base.  Artistic technique  All of the imagery on the Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora is in black-figure, a painting technique popularized during the Archaic period. The background of the images acquires a red hue through the firing process of the clay; no paint or pigment is added to achieve this color. To achieve the black images seen on the faces, handles, neck, and base of the amphora, Kleophrades painted the pre-fired clay with a watered down clay solution. Red details, such as the boxers' muscles, hair, and eyes, could be added in by carving into the added clay with a fine tool. Once the black figure details were added, Kleophrades fired the clay in the kiln in a multi-temperature process. First, the kiln would be heated to 800¬∞C (1472¬∞F) with a ventilating chamber kept open, thus allowing the clay to be fired in an oxygen-rich environment. This process causes the entire vase to glow red, including the added paint-like clay. Next, the kiln's vents would be closed and alternative tinder materials would be added to make the environment oxygen-poor and even hotter. Doing so allowed the added clay to turn black and glossy. Lastly, the potter would re-open the ventilation to re-oxygenate the kiln and allow the temperature to drop, thus causing the non-decorated regions to revert to their natural red color. While the majority of the black-figure painting on this amphora is the figurative depictions of Athena Promachos and the Pankration, the painter also added small, geometric decorative elements to the neck and base of the vessel.  Canon of Kleophrades works  While Kleophrades created more red-figure works than black-figure, he did paint several Panathenaic prize amphorae, all of which were in black-figure. As such, the technique was not out of the ordinary for him, but rather not used as frequently as red-figure. Kleophrades was especially renowned for his ability to incorporate pathos in his figural design and illicit emotion from the viewers. The dynamic Pankration scene is no exception, as it showcases the dynamic and dangerous nature of the sport. Many of his works featured figures from throughout Greek mythology and sporting events. The inclusion of both Athena Promachos and the Panathenaic Pankration in this prize amphora combines his two most popular subjects into one cohesive work.

A gunman killed eight people in the home. The suspect was later killed by police.  Background  Spencer Hight and Meredith Lane met while students at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD); Lane previously attended a tertiary institution in the State of Georgia before transferring to UTD. The couple married in May 2011. The house in which the shooting occurred had been purchased by the Hights in 2015. The couple had no children. After the shooting, Lane's mother stated that there was a violent episode where Hight had slammed her daughter's head against a wall, and that she had not reported it to the police. Hight had lost his contracting job at Texas Instruments near when the house was purchased. The couple stopped living together in March, and Meredith filed for divorce in July citing ‚Äúdiscord or conflict of personalities\\". Meredith Hight's mother claims that her daughter wanted the divorce since her husband was physically abusive and an alcoholic. She says her daughter had tried helping him for two years before filing the divorce. Friends of Spencer Hight reported that before the shooting, he was unable to find work, had become isolated, and was drinking alcohol heavily. Shooting People inside the home at the time of shooting said a Dallas Cowboys watching party was being held at the house. Meredith Lane, the owner of the house, was hosting a party for coworkers and friends. At around 8 p.m. officers were called to a home on West Spring Creek Parkway after reports of 30 to 40 shots being fired. Police entered the home and shot and killed the gunman. Inside police found nine adults with gunshot wounds. Seven were dead and two others were transported to a local hospital. One of the injured later died. Police say the shooter and all of the victims were adults. They were in their twenties and thirties. Two of the victims had participated in Hight and Lane's wedding. James Richard Dunlop had been best man, and Rion Christopher Morgan had been a groomsman. The shooter was identified as Spencer Hight and the apparent target of the shooting was his wife Meredith. Plano Police Chief Greg W. Rushin said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had a shooting of this magnitude; never had this many victims.‚Äù  Aftermath  The Junior League of Collin County organized a vigil for the victims of the attack ten days afterwards. The family of Spencer Hight released a statement, which said in part: \\"There can be no rational excuse for his horrific actions. We, as a family, express our deepest sorrow and condolences to all of the families and friends of the victims. These young, vibrant lives did not deserve to be taken.\\" In April, 2019, Lindsey Glass, a bartender at Local Public House in Plano, was charged for serving Hight alcohol, knowing he was intoxicated. The charge carries a fine of up to $500, up to a year in jail, or both. According to the charging documents she sent texts to a friend concerned about how drunk he was and brought a large knife he was exposing at the bar while commenting, \\"Spencer has a big knife on the bar and is spinning it and just asked for his tab and said I have to go do some dirty work ...

Accord summary The states agreed not to enter any other treaties to disadvantage of other members (Article 2), to communicate the other treaties to each other (Article 3), to resolve their disputes peacefully (Article 6), and to observe neutrality in case of an unprovoked attack on one of the signatories (Article 7). Of other issues, Article 1 stipulated reciprocal recognition of their treaties with (Soviet) Russia, Article 6 urged for conclusion of administrative and economic treaties, wherever missing, and Article 5 called for the guarantees of the rights of ethnic minorities. Article 8 set the validity term of 5 years, afterwards automatically extendable annually unless denunciated in advance. History Poland under J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski aspired for creating its own sphere of influence in the Baltics, leaving Estonia under the influence of Finland, while getting Latvia and Lithuania under the Polish one. Moreover, Pi≈Çsudski envisioned a grand Eastern European federation (Intermarium). However, the bitter dispute of Poland and Lithuania over the Vilnius Region was a major stumbling block. Therefore, Lithuania did not participate in the accord and even actively opposed to it. That made an alliance with Poland less attractive to Latvia and Estonia. Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Rudolf Holsti failed to get the accord ratified by the parliament and was served a vote of no confidence. That reflected a growing sentiment that Finland should align with either Germany, or the rest of Scandinavia instead of creating alliances with the Baltic states. The resulting accord was the extent of Polish success in creating a Baltic bloc. References Further reading *David M.

He sailed and fought alongside a number of prominent buccaneers such as Edward Davis, Francois Grogniet, William Dampier, and others. History L‚ÄôEscuyer 11-gun vessel sailed alongside Francois Groginet in 1685 when they led a large contingent of flibustiers (French buccaneers) and a few English to join a growing group of Englishmen under Captains Charles Swan, Townley, Davis, and others. The Frenchmen had arrived in canoes and open boats after marching across Panama. Davis granted them the captured Spanish prize ship San Rosario, which still had with over 300 Frenchmen aboard. There are varying accounts of L‚ÄôEscuyer‚Äôs involvement in subsequent events. The account of Raveneau de Lussan, leader of another group of French flibustiers who joined the group a few months later, indicates that L‚ÄôEscuyer‚Äôs crew ‚Äúhad recently lost their captain‚Äù and that the San Rosario was under the sole command of Grogniet. This account would place L‚ÄôEscuyer‚Äôs death in mid-1685. Other accounts claim that L‚ÄôEscuyer was part of the French contingent from that point forward, participating in the blockade of Panama, the group‚Äôs failure to capture the Spanish treasure fleet, and their sack of Guayaquil.

Built in 1906, the courthouse is Sauk County's fourth and its third in Baraboo. Wisconsin architecture firm Ferry & Clas designed the Neoclassical building. The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Sauk County's first courthouse was built in Prairie du Sac in 1844; however, the county seat moved to Baraboo two years later, and after a challenge from Reedsburg an 1852 referendum kept it there. The first courthouse in Baraboo was completed in 1848, on the present-day courthouse square; the two-story building also hosted classes, dances, and church services in its courtroom. The 1848 courthouse burned down in the 1850s, and the county constructed a new brick courthouse at the same site. The new courthouse ultimately burned down as well, in December 1904; however, the county had voted to replace it a month before the fire. Its replacement, the current courthouse, was completed in 1906. Accompanied by photos. The courthouse's tower was renovated in 1915 to add bells. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 9, 1982. The county expanded it in 1989 and renovated it in 1996. Architecture Milwaukee-based architecture firm Ferry & Clas designed the Neoclassical courthouse. The two-story building is built of Indiana limestone. The front entrance is flanked by two-story Ionic pilasters; the door is topped by a pediment, and long windows on the second floor complete the entrance. An entablature and projecting cornice, separated by dentillation, run along the building's roof line. The courthouse's terra cotta hip roof is topped by a clock tower, which was originally a cupola before its renovation. While much of the interior has been renovated, the courthouse's marble staircase hall and barrel vaulted corridors are original; the former features decorative capitals and egg-and-dart moldings.

When data is transmitted across networks, if the data packets are not encrypted, the data within the network packet can be read using a sniffer. Using a sniffer application, an attacker can analyze the network and gain information to eventually cause the network to crash or to become corrupted, or read the communications happening across the network. General Sniffing attacks can be compared to tapping of phone wires and get to know about the conversation, and for this reason, it is also referred as wiretapping applied to computer networks. Using sniffing tools, attackers can sniff sensitive information from a network, including Email traffic (SMTP, POP, IMAP traffic), Web traffic (HTTP), FTP traffic (Telnet authentication, FTP Passwords, SMB, NFS) and many more. The Packet Sniffer utility usually sniffs the network data without making any modifications in the network's packets. Packet sniffers can just watch, display, and log the traffic, and this information can be accessed by the attacker. Prevention To prevent networks from sniffing attacks, organizations and individual users should keep away from applications that are using insecure protocols, like basic HTTP authentication, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Telnet. Instead, secure protocols such as HTTPS, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and Secure Shell (SSH) should be preferred. In case there is a necessity for using any insecure protocol in any application, all the data transmission should be encrypted. If required, VPN (Virtual Private Networks) can be used to provide secure access to users.

It is the 278th episode of the series overall, and first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on September 13, 2017. The episode parodied the use of smart speakers, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Siri, and the use of Confederate flags in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Plot Eric Cartman and his classmates play with an Amazon Echo Smart speaker, giving it instructions that include profanity, and laugh when the device repeats the inappropriate language. Cartman immediately becomes depressed when his girlfriend Heidi Turner appears and interrupts their laughter, and she in turn becomes frustrated when he refuses to express his feelings. Meanwhile, Randy and Sharon Marsh have started a television series titled White People Renovating Houses that features the couple redesigning people's homes. One of their broadcasts is interrupted when a group of men waving torches and Confederate flags are shown in the background protesting smart speakers because they believe the products have left them unemployed. Randy is irritated by their protest, but later decides to help them get jobs in which they serve as replacements for the smart speakers by responding to users' voice commands. Cartman is dismayed to find his Alexa Echo has been replaced with a human, one who refuses to repeat his inappropriate language. Another man, Darryl Weathers, has accepted the job as Randy's smart speaker, but soon finds the job demeaning and quits. Randy berates him for being closed minded about the future until Darryl reveals his frustration that he cannot knock down the load bearing walls in his house via renovation without his second floor collapsing. Randy offers to prop the ceiling up while knocking down the wall and delights Darryl with his redesign of the house. Cartman finds a pile of abandoned smart speakers in an alley and takes them home. Heidi goes to Cartman's house to apologize for upsetting him, but his mother says she cannot get him to leave his room. He is then shown laughing as the smart speakers comply with his requests. Before Heidi can apologize to him when they arrive at school, he ends their relationship, saying that he cannot tolerate her \\"abusive\\" treatment of him, and walks away. Production notes Ryan Parker with The Hollywood Reporter reported smart speakers belonging to multiple viewers, in particular Amazon Echos and Google Homes, reacted to the various commands Cartman spoke during the episode, including setting unwanted alarms and adding sexual items to shopping lists. Viewers reported on Twitter that they had to turn off their devices to prevent issues and posted videos of the reactions. Cultural references The episode features the character \\"Jim Bob\\" perform a country-esque parody of American rapper Kendrick Lamar's song \\"Humble\\". Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode a 5.8 out of 10, writing that it \\"tackled many subjects and failed to combine them into a proper whole.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 5.0 out of 10, stating \\"[the episode] didn't exactly provide hope for this year. There were some funny moments and I appreciated how Matt and Trey spun the narrative, but it didn't 'wow' me the way I was hoping.\\" The A.V. Club contributor Dan Caffrey gave the episode a C+ rating, commenting \\"Parker and Stone never take their redneck/white nationalist stereotypes far enough from the source material for it to work as a joke that can stand on its own. And because they borrow so heavily from the Charlottesville protests without ever fully skewering the participants, the episode doesn't work as social commentary, either.\\" Writing for Den of Geek, Chris Longo gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, and stated \\"From a show that had more biting satirical commentary on topics like Safe Spaces and PC culture, George Zimmerman, and Black Lives Matter, I expected a much stronger response to the events of Charlottesville from a South Park season premiere.\\" References External links *\\"Episode 2101 'White People Renovating Houses' Press Release\\".

However, even as Chung Han-ah depicts the pains of such characters, she does not lose her optimism for life. The characters do not frivolously reveal their pains, or attempt to hold onto what they're losing. They give up on things that they cannot do anything about, and do what they can. However, this doesn't mean that they are powerless beings that succumb to reality.

Zodiac Milprof was a business unit of Zodiac Aerospace till 2008, when it was christened Milpro. In 2011 it was spun off from Zodiac Aerospace and it became an independent companyhttps://www.bilansgratuits.fr/entreprise/fiche/53431701100037.htm. Zodiac Milpro has originated most of the major concepts that have driven the development of the modern inflatable boat since the 1930s. Since those early days, it has become the main manufacturer of inflatable and semi-rigid boats for professional and military applications..  Name  Though Zodiac Milpro and Zodiac Nautic produce a large range of both inflatable and rigid-hulled boats, the name \\"Zodiac\\" has become synonymous with inflatable boats such as the FC470 and as a generic term for inflatable boat.  History  The first inflatable boats were designed in 1920 by Zodiac, which produced its first prototypes for the army in 1934. In 1934, Zodiac engineer Pierre Debroutelle designed the prototype of an inflatable kayak. In 1937, interested in his research, the Naval Aviation commissioned him to develop a boat capable of carrying torpedoes and bombs. Pierre Debroutelle developed a new prototype: a U-shaped boat equipped with two side air chambers joined by a wooden dashboard: the true ancestor of the modern Zodiac inflatable boat. In 1940, Zodiac Milpro invented the prototype of the first inflatable boat. Since the 1940s every major development in the inflatable boat and RIB industry has been developed by Zodiac Milpro. In the early 60‚Äôs, the Royal National Lifeboat Institute in Great Britain designed the first rigid hulled inflatable boat or RIB. This hybrid craft was developed for high speed, offshore sea and rescue operations. Zodiac Milpro continued research and development of this new technology and developed the concept into today‚Äôs very successful rigid hull inflatable boats. In 1987, Zodiac SA acquired a majority share in the capital of Zodiac Marine Ltd. and a majority stake in Hurricane Rescue Craft Inc. and formed Zodiac Hurricane Marine Inc. (ZHM). In 1991, Zodiac SA combined its Toronto-based distribution subsidiary (ZIT) with its manufacturing company in Richmond (ZHM), to form Zodiac Hurricane Technologies Inc. (ZHT). Today, Zodiac Hurricane Technologies is the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer of professional RIBs.

Overview While the ≈öƒÅlistamba does not survive fully in Sanskrit, it is the most widely quoted sutra in Mahayana texts on the topic of pratityasamutpada and thus about 90 percent of the material survives as various quotations in other Buddhist Sanskrit works. Therefore, the Sanskrit has been reconstructed by modern scholars (beginning with the work of Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin, 1913). Many passages in this sutra have close parallels in the Pali suttas (especially the Mahatanha- sahkhaya Sutta, M1:256-71).Reat, 1993, p. 3.Potter, Karl H. Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. page 32. The Salistamba also survives in six Chinese translations and in various Tibetan recensions, including some manuscripts from Dunhuang, and it is thus of great textual, historical and philological importance.Reat, 1993, p. 1.Tatz, Mark.

The ≈öƒÅlistamba S≈´tra shows that its proto-Mahayana transmitters (possibly the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas) knew and accepted a theory of dependent origination which is almost identical with that of the Pali canon.Reat, 1993, p. 2. It also shows a intent to consolidate and systematize material that is found throughout the Pali Canon with a few new, albeit conservative innovations.Reat, 1993, p. 5. For example, it applies a simile of seed and plants to the doctrine of dependent origination, something which is not found in the Pali canon.Reat, 1993, p. 6. The core of the sutra is an \\"elaboration upon cause (hetu) in the subjective pratityasamutpada formula.\\"Reat, 1993, p. 11. Mahayana elements in the sutra include the fact that it is said to be given by the Bodhisattva Maitreya and that it ends stating that whoever understands dependent arising will become a perfectly enlightened Buddha. The sutra is also a work focusing on the attainment of the Dharmakaya Buddha, stating \\"Whoever, monks, sees conditioned arising sees Dharma, and whoever sees Dharma sees the Buddha\\" (a combination of two well known statements in the Pali suttas).Reat, 1993, p. 3. The sutra also seems to move closer to the Mahayana view that reality is illusory, using the term maya and also similes using reflections, which would become widely used to illustrate illusioriness in the Mahayana sutras.Reat, 1993, p. 10. N. Ross Reat notes that this indicates that the early Mahayana tendency was not \\"self- consciously schismatic\\" but was simply one of the many attempts to systematize and elaborate on the Buddha's teachings. While some schools chose to incorporate these systematizations into Abhidharma texts, the proto-Mahayana chose to incorporate them into sutras.Reat, 1993, p. 9. Translations and editions *Reat, N.

They are the oldest known papyri with text. The text was found in 2013 by a French mission under the direction of archaeologists Pierre Tallet of Paris-Sorbonne University and Gregory Marouard in a cave in Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea coast. The text is written with hieroglyphs and hieratic on papyrus. The diary of Merer, a middle ranking official with the title inspector (sHD), is thought to date to the 26th year of the reign of Pharaoh Khufu Pierre Tallet: Les papyrus de la Mer Rouge I, Le journal de Merer, (papyrus Jarf A et B), MIFAO 136, Cairo 2017, , p. 160 and describes several months of work with the transportation of limestone from Tura to Giza. Though the diary does not specify where the stones were to be used or for what purpose, given the diary may date to what is widely considered the very end of Khufu's reign, Tallet believes they were most likely for cladding the outside of the Great Pyramid. About every ten days, two or three round trips were done, shipping perhaps 30 blocks of 2‚Äì3 tonnes each, amounting to 200 blocks per month. About forty boatmen worked under him.

He goes through his daily routine and interacts with his colleagues, his mistress and his family, but feels lost and out of balance. He observes everything around him in search for a sensation that feels genuine.

It is endemic to southern China and found in the Guizhou, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces. Its type locality is Mount Dayao of Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi. Prior to naming of this species in 2011, it was confused with Pachytriton labiatus (now Paramesotriton labiatus). It is one of the several species that can appear in the pet trade as paddletail newt. The specific name inexpectatus is Latin meaning \\"unexpected\\" and refers to finding a species that is common in pet trade but lacked formal scientific description. Common name Yaoshan stout newt has been coined specifically for this species. Description Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length and in total length. Adult females measure in snout‚Äìvent length and in total length. The body is stout. The fingers and the toes have slight webbing. The tail tip is broad. Skin is smooth. The dorsum is uniformly dark brown. The venter is lighter and has reddish orange markings, some of them joining to form two longitudinal lines. There are small reddish orange markings scattered on throat and underside of limbs; some specimens have an orange spot on the dorsal base of each limb. The underside of tail and cloaca are reddish orange. Habitat and conservation Adult Pachytriton inexpectatus live in mountain rivers, including steep and shallow side streams. They are nocturnal and prey upon aquatic insects, crustaceans, and annelids, as well as insects of terrestrial origin. Breeding seems to occur in early summer. Small juveniles are probably terrestrial. As of mid-2018, this species has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Life  Song Jaehak was born in Yeongcheon, South Korea in 1955. He studied dentistry at Kyungpook National University and currently works as a dentist in the city of Daegu. He began writing in his teens when he joined a literary club at his middle school and high school. He continued to write and debuted as a poet when the journal World Literature published his poem Eodueun naljjareul seucheoseo (Ïñ¥ÎëêÏö¥ ÎÇ†ÏßúÎ•º Ïä§Ï≥êÏÑú Brushing Past the Dark Days) in 1986. Song's poetry was noted for its emphasis on thought over sentiment. It combined clinical observations of objects and the world with the subjectivity of imagination. He published his first poetry collection Eoreum sijip (ÏñºÏùåÏãúÏßë Ice Poetry Collection) in 1988, followed by Pureunbitgwa ssauda (Ìë∏Î•∏ÎπõÍ≥º Ïã∏Ïö∞Îã§ Fighting Blue Light) in 1994, Geuga nae ulgureul manjine (Í∑∏Í∞Ä ÎÇ¥ ÏñºÍµ¥ÏùÑ ÎßåÏßÄÎÑ§ He's Touching My Face) in 1997, Gieokdeul (Í∏∞ÏñµÎì§ Memories) in 2001, Jinheukeolgul (ÏßÑÌùôÏñºÍµ¥ Mud Face) in 2005, Naeganchereul eotda (ÎÇ¥Í∞ÑÏ≤¥Î•º ÏñªÎã§ I've Acquired the Language of Women) in 2011, Naljjadeul (ÎÇ†ÏßúÎì§ Dates) in 2013, and Geomeunsaek (Í≤ÄÏùÄÏÉâ Black) in 2015. He is the winner of several accolades, including the Kim Daljin Literature Prize, Pyeon-un Literature Award, and Jeon Bonggeon Literary Award.  Writing  Song's poetry is known for appealing to the senses, especially by use of imagery and color. Eoreum sijip (ÏñºÏùåÏãúÏßë Ice Poetry Collection) describes the anguish of worldly relationships and the process of overcoming it. His subsequent poems are a continuation of that theme and explore the essence of life in a measured tone. Following his third poetry collection Geuga nae ulgureul manjine (Í∑∏Í∞Ä ÎÇ¥ ÏñºÍµ¥ÏùÑ ÎßåÏßÄÎÑ§ He's Touching My Face), which offers a unique interpretation of color and a sympathetic portrayal of everyday life, Song begins to use more compact language to express his thoughts and intuitions. The judges of the Yi Sang Poetry Award note that Song makes effective use of \\"synesthesia triggered by visual cues\\" and that \\"his symbols are not rhetoric but shed light on truth,\\" which is why his poetry can be said to \\"transcend the contradictions of Western modernism.\\" In addition, literary critic Lee Gwang-ho observes that Song's poetry brings together bodily senses with the beauty of landscapes, describing him as \\"a poet who finds passages of the body in images.\\" In his 2015 poetry collection, Geomeunsaek (Í≤ÄÏùÄÏÉâ Black), Song probes the nature of the world through the color black, which he uses to represent death.

Loom chose her disguise of a cute 12-year-old Teresa based on characters she saw on a movie billboard from across the Greens' house, and named his brother Goliath off of a dog's ID tag.http://www.primotv.com/pumpkinreports/teresa-green  Ran Strb  Ran Strb, also referred to as his civilian name, Goliath Green (voiced by Pietro Ubaldi) is a 380-year-old Kemii who was nearing retirement when he got his assignment and thought the job would be a drag. Ran doesn't speak in any Earth languages, and instead speaks only the Kemii language. His body is heavily clothed and he has a mop of pumpkin-orange hair, so only a portion of his face is ever shown. He also has a long vegetal tail with a mind of its own, and can extend a slimy psedupodal green stalk-body on which he can elevate his kindergarten-sized self to an intimidating 20-feet high.  Victor Green  Victor Green (voiced by H.D. Quinn) is a loving, if somewhat distracted, father and a doting husband. He has the ambition of doing great things for his family. He and his son, Max share a positive outlook on life, and a slight tendency to be unrealistically optimistic. He is a mid-level executive at Cucurtown's biggest business, Cutlery Land.  Laura Green  Laura Green (voiced by Lindsay Sheppard) is Max's mother, and she loves her children. She also loves gardening. Her primo gourd-growth is the first reason her backyard was chosen by Loom as the landing site for the Kemii Advance Team, and her prize-winning pumpkin is alien headquarters. Laura is a happy homemaker with a college degree in Botany, but beyond her garden and family she has a big ambition; to compete someday on the popular weekly TV game show Who Knows What with her large, and growing expertise in koalas and Australian Rules Football.  Max Green  Max Green (voiced by Shannon Conley) is an energetic, bossy, underhand 11-year-old. He is good at sports, talented in music and academics, and was popular at school until Loom and Ran, his adoptive \\"siblings\\" showed up and stole the show. His goal is to make people believe his alien siblings theory for attempting to use his home as a home base for stealing Earth, and to stop their daily reports about the human race to their home planet, Kemii.http://www.primotv.com/pumpkinreports/max Pixel Sillicon Pixel Sillicon is a fool 11‚Äêyear‚Äêold who loves aliens. His father is a dedicated UFOlogist, which accounts for Pixel's interest, but not for the depth of his ardor. Pixel believes he was abducted by aliens and he sincerely hopes to be abducted again one day ‚Äì so he leaves his bedroom window open at night and has an arrow of lights on the roof pointing to his room. Pixel's easy credulity makes him a less-than-perfect ally for Max's campaign to convince the townspeople. He's loyal to his good friend Max, not least because Max actually lives with two aliens. Despite his admiration of Max and acknowledgment of Max as the anti-invasion Team Leader, Pixel is romantically attracted to Loom, and believed he and she could rule earth between them as benevolent King and Queen before seeing her soulmate and their plans of ruling their kingdom. Dylan Jones provides his voice. Simon Sillicon Pixel's father, Simon Sillicon, abandoned his foundational computer work (which resulted in a famous Valley in California being named after him) to devote his genius to discovering the aliens he has been convinced have been walking among us for 30 years. The real scientific community shunned Simon years ago, so for three decades Simon has worked, inventing hitech gleaming gadgets and computer programs to fight the alien onslaught he's certain is coming. Simon is so tech-focused, so intent upon his devices and computer algorithms, the issue of being bossed‚Äêaround by two kids doesn‚Äôt come up. He's glad to be of service in any plan that Max or Violet contrive. Simon has a mysterious past. There are files which are getting him involved in a big scandal. He is voiced by Matt Ban. Violet Violet Violet Violet is a smart, strong-willed, trend-bucking 11-year-old girl with a BIG fashion sense and a blog describing how she‚Äôd like to improve the world ‚Äì its music, aesthetics, and especially its rigid, closed-minded people; like the teachers who won‚Äôt let her wear a swan hat to class. She wears violet clothing, dyes her hair violet, and is looking for a violet pet. To her, the color represents the repudiation of conformity. Her being strong- willed is a problem, because Max is strong-willed too. These two, competitors in school and now in saving the planet, seldom see eye-to-eye. Each one wants to run their alien-busting outfit and each chafes at anything sounding like \\"orders\\" coming from the other. She is voiced by Stephanie Pam Roberts.

Sparked by a fight between a migrant teen from Sichuan and a local schoolboy, the violence snowballed into a major riot by hundreds of mostly Sichuanese workers as tensions between migrant workers and natives boiled over. Background According to the Wall Street Journal, more than 24 million migrants from other parts of China live in Guangdong, one of China's richest provinces, while an addition 10 million have moved from poor to rich areas within the province. Migrants generally do not receive local services like healthcare and education, because their household registration, or hukou, shows them as living in their original village. Tensions have frequently arisen between migrants and locals due to attendant issues, especially since migrants are often suspected of criminality and suffer abuse from local police. Many local towns and even cities recognize that they would not be able to afford offering the same services to migrants as they offer to legal residents. Riot The riot reportedly began after police arrested and allegedly abused a teenager from Chongqing who was accused of beating up a local schoolboy. The South China Morning Post reported online allegations that the teenager had frequently extorted students for cash, threatening them with violence if they refused. A crowd of migrants gathered, and then at some point began to rampage, destroying police cars, looting shops, and attacking local people. Within two days, the city had been placed under lockdown, with hundreds of military and security personnel in the area. Despite vehement denials by Chinese officials, locals reported that many were wounded in the riot and that several had been killed when security forces intervened.

The sculpture of the Lion of Judah, in gilded bronze, is placed on a black granite pedestal decorated with relief portraits of Menelik II, Haile Selassie I, Zewditu, and ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael.

After the 1974 revolution, the Derg regime thought of removing the monument, symbol of the monarchy, but an association of Arbegnoch veterans claimed that it was a memory of Ethiopian antifascist resistance and a symbol of Ethiopia.

The Lion of Judah sculpture was placed just beyond Square of Five hundred to Rome, under the obelisk that remembers of the Battle of Dogali on May 8, 1937, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the proclamation of the Italian Empire.

The earliest known human settlement dates back to the Upper Paleolithic, 40,000 BC in the Kryegjata Valley, near the antique site of Apollonia... Several further Paleolithic sites have been excavated, out of which the most prominent ones are the cave of Konispol (24,700 BC),... the flint tools found near Xarr√´,. the shelters of the Blaz Cave near Urak√´. and the habitation of Mount Dajt, then during the period of the Mesolithic the aforementioned Kryegjata,. Konispol. and Gajtan sites represent more developed stone, flint and horn tools. Another important site of the Mesolithic industrial activity is the flint mine of Goranxi that was in operation around 7,000 BC... The excavation project of the prehistoric settlement of Vasht√´mi was completed in 2013, and the results thereof confirmed that it was one of the earliest farming sites in Europe, dating back to 6,600 BC, long before the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution would have reached the region... Vasht√´mi was situated near the Devoll river feeding the Maliq Lake, a region that became the cradle of the most prominent Neolithic culture of present-day Albania: the Maliq culture. It initially included the settlements of Vasht√´mi, Dunavec, Maliq and Podgorie.... Their artifacts, pottery and spiritual culture spread through the valleys, and by the end of the Lower Neolithic it covered a sizeable area including the territory of the modern Eastern Albania.. The human settlements of the western parts of the present-day country were rather connected to the archaeological cultures of the Adriatic Sea and the Danube valley... During the Middle Neolithic, 5th-4th millennia BC achievement of a cultural unity was underway, which was represented by the prevailing black and grey polished pottery, four-footed ceramic ritual objects and Mother Earth figurines across the contemporary sites of Dunavec‚ÄìMaliq, Cakran, Kolsh and Xarr√´.... This unity became even more evident during the Late Neolithic, due to the more intensive relationships between the settlements that helped the widespread adaptation of the new technological inventions and processing methods (hoe, mill stone, primitive spinning wheel), ceramics painted with two or three colors (typically red and black), featuring elaborated designs and patterns.. With the Chalcolithic, in the second half of 3rd millennium BC the first tools made of copper emerged and helped the contemporary man be more efficient in agricultural and industrial activities. The ceramic pottery continued the Neolithic tradition from both typological and technological aspect, yet it adapted some of the methods and patterns of the other cultures on the Balkan Peninsula... At the same time the man of the epoch was witnessing the great Indo-European migrations of the Proto-Indo-Europeans leaving their homeland in the Eastern European steppes and spreading towards Asia and Europe. Based on the archaeological findings and facts the leading Albanian archaeologist Muzafer Korkuti stated that although these nomadic migrants brought along their culture into the eastern part of the Balkans, yet they were blended with the local indigenous population which by the end of the Copper Age ended up in the formation of an ethnocultural basis of the later Illyrians..

Description Territory that was once covered by the Yunnan Plateau subtropical evergreen forests includes most of the western Yungui Plateau which makes up the eastern half of Yunnan as well as parts of southern Sichuan, western Guizhou, and northwestern Guangxi. This region experiences a mild climate as the high altitude and low latitude negate many of the extreme effects of either climatic feature. The Yungui Plateau is relatively flatter here and human agricultural development has greatly reduced the extent of the Yunnan Plateau evergreen forests. In some areas of the ecoregion, rice production has reached altitudes of nearly , the highest anywhere in the world. Today, forest remnants are isolated along mountain ridges, karst hills, and steeper valleys where agriculture is not prevalent. Significant remaining tracts of the evergreen forests include Qinglongxia Scenic Area, the Cang Mountains, Mount Jizu, the Western Hills Forest Reserve, and the Ailao Mountain Nature Reserve. In other places in the ecoregion, the evergreen forests have been replaced by strands of dominating Yunnan Pine. It is unclear to what extent Yunnan Pine coexisted in the Yunnan Plateau subtropical evergreen forests prior to agricultural development in the region.

Life   Provenance and early years  Konstantin Zetkin, always identified as \\"Kostja\\" in family correspondence and in almost all other sources, was born in Paris. Kostja's father, Ossip Zetkin (1850‚Äì1889), was a Russian revolutionary and socialist who had suffered persecution on account of his involvement in the Narodniks movement and fled to Leipzig where, as a young man, he had supported himself as a carpenter and become active in student politics. That was how he met the trainee teacher, Clara Ei√üner (1857‚Äì1933). In the context of the recently enacted Anti- Socialist Laws Ossip Zetkin was arrested at a political meeting in 1880, identified as a \\"burdensome foreigner\\" (\\"l√§stiger Ausl√§nder\\") and deprived of his Leipzig residence permit. He moved to Paris where, two years later, he was joined by Clara Ei√üner. The two had probably become lovers in Leipzig, and now they resumed their partnership. Clara adopted his family name, but the two of them never formally married. According to one source they could not marry because Ossip was unable to obtain the necessary papers from Russia: another version indicates that Clara was reluctant to enter into a marriage which would have caused her to lose her German citizenship. Their two sons, Maxim and Kostja, were born in 1883 and 1885. Ossip Zetkin died from tuberculosis at the start of 1889. In 1891 Clara Zetkin moved with her two boys back to Germany. Instead of returning to Saxony, where she had been born and grown up, she took her family to live in the west of the country, in Stuttgart, where she remained till the mid 1920s, and where Kostja and his elder brother grew up. At first the boys had difficulties with the German language, but they overcame any initial educational handicaps by the time they were old enough for secondary school. They both attended the well-regarded Karls-Gymnasium (secondary school) in Stuttgart, while their mother energetically pursued a political and journalistic career as an activist member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and as editor of Gleichheit, a bimonthly women's newspaper committed to gender equality.  Rosa Luxemburg and student years  It was presumably as a result of his mother's political activism that Kostja Zetkin met Rosa Luxemburg. He became the lover of his mother's friend in 1907, and this aspect of the relationship with Rosa Luxemburg lasted till his conscription in 1915, although they would remain lifelong friends. It was also at least partly on Luxemburg's recommendation that he studied Social Economics, while lodging with her in Berlin. Social economics was the subject on which Luxemburg herself lectured at the SPD Party Academy. However, at some stage Kostja Zetkin switched to the study of Medicine (which was also the subject that his brother studied between 1902 and 1908).  War  War was declared in July 1914 and on 5 March 1915, before he had been able to complete his medical studies, Kostja Zetkin was conscripted into the army. He served as a medical officer on the Western Front, participating in the Battle of the Somme, at Verdun and, later, at Rheims. He continued as a medical officer through several promotions, and was awarded the Iron Cross (Class II) on 10 November 1916. After war ended in 1918 he resumed his medical studies, passing his state medical exams in 1923 with a distinction.  Mother and politics  During the years after 1923 his mother's health deteriorated progressively and he devoted a substantial part of his energy to looking after her and to supporting her political work. At one stage he described himself wryly as his mother's \\"technical worker\\" (\\"technischer Mitarbeiter\\"). His mother remained a prolific writer, and her letters disclose that during the 1920s and early 1930s Kostja Zetkin was living for a time with Nadja von Massov. (Rosa Luxemburg had been murdered early in 1919.) In 1923 Kostja Zetkin was a co- instigator, together with Karl Korsch, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs and Richard Sorge, in founding the Institute for Social Research (\\"Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung\\" / IFS) at Frankfurt University. In connection with the IFS, he was also one of those who took part in the \\"First Marxist Work Week\\" conference held near Arnstadt for eight days towards the end of May 1923.  Nazi Germany  After the decline of the Weimar Republic, the Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Popular support for the Nazis rested on the pillars of Hope and Hatred. Jews and Communists were marked out as targets for state persecution, especially after the Reichstag fire in February 1933. Clara Zetkin was a high-profile communist and Ossip Zetkin had been Jewish. It was time to leave. Kostja Zetkin moved to the Soviet Union, where Kostja's elder brother Maxim had been working as a physician since 1920. Clara Zetkin had already lived in Moscow and been looked after there by her elder son between 1924 and 1929.  Moscow  Clara Zetkin died on 20 June 1933 at Arkhangelskoye, a short distance outside Moscow. As a high-profile communist, friend of Rosa Luxemburg and feminist activist over many decades, Clara Zetkin enjoyed a quasi-iconic status with Moscow power brokers, which now proved to be something of a mixed blessing. Kostja Zetkin found himself in disagreement with government representatives, apparently because of differing opinions concerning the selective publication of some of his late mother's large collection of articles, essays, letters and other politically relevant papers. Moscow's epidemic of political disappearances still lay in the future, but Zetkin evidently appreciated that disagreements with the authorities were unwinnable and that he himself was in danger as long as the situation persisted. He applied for permission to emigrate again, this time to Prague to work as a physician. The application was granted, not without some \\"bureaucratic reluctance\\", and in 1935 Kostja Zetkin moved to Czechoslovakia where he remained till 1938.  Gertrude Bardenhewer  In Czechoslovakia Kostya Zetkin and Gertrude Bardenhewer became lovers in 1935. Later they married. They were both qualified medical practitioners and there is speculation that they may originally have met as politically active medical students in Berlin. By 1935 Gertrude Bardenhewer had been a single mother for more than a decade. Keen to give birth to a child with artistic gifts she had teamed up with the artist-polymath Otto Tetjus T√ºgel, given birth to their son Lukas, and then gone on her way, taking the baby with her. By the late 1930s the boy was virtually grown up, and finding himself in London when war broke out in 1939 he joined the British army. A few years later he emigrated to the United States of America. German invasion of Czechoslovakia during 1938 and 1939 enforced further flight. Kostja and Gertrude, now together, made their way to Paris. Sources differ over whether they left Czechoslovakia shortly before or shortly after German troops occupied the whole country. They travelled via Switzerland where they spent some time and may have contemplated settling. But they also perceived a risk that even in Switzerland the authorities could not protect them from assassination by a gunman-agent sent from the Soviet Union or Germany. The Zetkin name carried its own politically charged legacy.  France  Kostja Zetkin arrived in France in April 1939. He had already written in a letter to a friend, acknowledging that restrictive employment regulations made it harder for German-qualified physicians to find professional employment in France than in Czechoslovakia. Nevertheless, the Zetkins had friends in France who, in the words of one source, \\"hid them in the French countryside\\". Zetkin was able to work as a nurse and as a masseur- physiotherapist. He also took work as a farm labourer. War returned in September 1939, but it was only in May 1940 that German forces invaded France. The authorities responded by identifying as enemy aliens thousands of German refugees who had been forced to seek refuge in France for reasons of politics and / or race. Zetkin was detained in a camp for four months, almost certainly in the southern part of the country. His comments from the time indicate that conditions in France became so intolerable that he was already looking for ways to move on to another country. He might already have applied - at this stage unsuccessfully - for permission to leave France and enter the United States of America. References in his letters to relatives already in the United States - most likely the family of Gertrude's sister, Inge - certainly hint at that possibility. By the time Zetkin left his internment camp in France, the southern part of the country was governed from Vichy by a puppet government. Security in the camps was at this stage frequently lax, but according to one source Gertrude secured release for the Kostja using the highly unconventional device of disclosing their true identities to a camp guard whom she judged, correctly, to be politically aware, and no friend to the Nazis. The guard responded quietly but pointedly. \\"We cannot have the son of Clara Zetkin in a prison cell.\\" Even if the story has been embroidered in the telling, it is beyond dispute that Kostja and Gertrude succeeded, with difficulty, in escaping via Spain (and probably Portugal) to the United States, where they arrived in or before 1945. By the time the French authorities had issued them with travel permits, their French travel-identity papers indicate that Kostja and Gertrude were married to one another.  North America  The Zetkins always felt that they were viewed with mistrust by the authorities in the USA. Initially the only work they could find as qualified physicians was at a dairy farm. They later found work as \\"medical orderlies\\" in a succession of psychiatric institutions, described in one source as \\"hell holes\\". War having ended in 1945, by 1949 the Zetkins were trying to find work as physicians back in Germany, but without success. As McCarthyism became mainstream in the political establishment, the fact that Kostja's elder brother, having survived in Moscow the Stalinist purges of the later 1930s, was now back in Germany working as a hospital director and senior professor of medicine at the principal university in Soviet administered East Berlin, will have done nothing to enhance Kostja's own career prospects in the US. Nevertheless, he had work of a sorts and was accruing pension entitlement which he was reluctant to place at risk. Despite becoming increasingly depressed he continued to work in the US medical system till 1957 when he retired. The Zetkins now relocated one last time, settling in a cottage owned by one of Gertrude's sisters on the Canadian west coast at Halfmoon Bay. By this time Kostja Zetkin's health was failing, and in 1963 he had to undergo a major operation, which involved the removal of most of his stomach, on account of a Perforated ulcer. He nevertheless survived the operation and indeed lived on for more than another seventeen years, dying in 1980. Gertrude died a few months later, in January 1981.  Significance  Die Zeit characterised the literary and political importance of Kostja Zetkin in the following terms: :\\"The most important publication presents the letters of Rosa Luxemburg to Kostja Zetkin.Briefe von 1893 bis 1905 an Kostja Zetkin. In: Rosa Luxemburg - Gesammelte Briefe, herausgegeben vom Institut f√ºr Marxismus-Leninismus beim ZK der SED, 5 B√§nde, Dietz Verlag, Berlin (DDR) 1982‚Äì1984. Unfortunately the compilers of the collection of more than 600 letters left out around 70 on account of their \\"primarily private-intimate character\\". The restraint is hard to understand when the reader considers the way in which the published letters frequently display a \\"private-intimate character\\"\\". :\\"Die wichtigste Erstver√∂ffentlichung stellen dabei die Briefe Rosa Luxemburgs an Kostja Zetkin (1885-1980) dar. Leider haben die Herausgeber von den √ºber 600 erhaltenen Briefen wegen ihres ‚Äûvorwiegend privat-intimen Charakters‚Äú rund 70 nicht aufgenommen und gelegentlich ‚Äûgeringe Auslassungen‚Äú vorgenommen. Diese Zur√ºckhaltung ist wenig verst√§ndlich, zumal wenn man feststellt, da√ü auch die ver√∂ffentlichten Briefe h√§ufig durchaus ‚Äûprivat-intimen‚Äú Charakters sind.\\" Rosa Luxemburg continues to fascinate, and despite her powerful political intellect and activism, her love life also attracts attention. In 2008, to the bewilderment of some scholars, Rosa Luxemburg's life formed the basis for a stage-musical at the Grips-Theater (youth theatre) in Berlin. One commentator wrote: :\\"Rosa Luxemburg never married: almost always she had younger lovers. According to the actress Regine Seidler (who took the title role in the musical), her happiest time was spent with Kostja Zetkin, the son of her best friend, Clara Zetkin. That was a deep and complete love affair. In East Germany they played down this aspect. The preferred to imply that that Rosa Luxemburg had a motherly relationship with her tenant. A singular rewrite.\\" :\\"Rosa Luxemburg war zeitlebens unverheiratet, sie hatte fast immer j√ºngere Liebhaber.

It flourished between the 2nd century BC and 15th century AD. Despite its association with China in recent centuries, the Maritime Silk Road was primarily established and operated by Austronesian sailors in Southeast Asia, Tamil merchants in India and Southeast Asia, Greco-Roman merchants in East Africa, India, Ceylon and Indochina,Roman merchants in Indonesia and Indochina and by Persian and Arab traders in the Arabian Sea and beyond. History Austronesian proto-historic and historic maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean Historic Indosphere cultural influence zone of Greater India for transmission of elements of Indian elements such as the honorific titles, naming of people, naming of places, mottos of organisations and educational institutes as well as adoption of Hinduism, Buddhism, Indian architecture, martial arts, Indian music and dance, traditional Indian clothing, and Indian cuisine, a process which has also been aided by the ongoing historic expansion of Indian diaspora. The Maritime Silk Road developed from the earlier Austronesian spice trade networks of Islander Southeast Asians with Sri Lanka and Southern India (established 1000 to 600 BCE), as well as the jade industry trade in lingling-o artifacts from the Philippines in the South China Sea (c. 500 BCE). For most of its history, Austronesian thalassocracies controlled the flow of the Maritime Silk Road, especially the polities around the straits of Malacca and Bangka, the Malay peninsula, and the Mekong delta; although Chinese records misidentified these kingdoms as being \\"Indian\\" due to the Indianization of these regions. The route was influential in the early spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to the east. Tang records indicate that Srivijaya, founded at Palembang in 682 CE, rose to dominate the trade in the region around the straits and the South China Sea emporium by controlling the trade in luxury aromatics and Buddhist artifacts from West Asia to a thriving Tang market. Chinese records also indicate that the early Chinese Buddhist pilgrims to South Asia booked passage with the Austronesian ships that traded in Chinese ports. Books written by Chinese monks like Wan Chen and Hui-Lin contain detailed accounts of the large trading vessels from Southeast Asia dating back to at least the 3rd century CE. One of the Borobudur ships from the 8th century, they were depictions of large native outrigger trading vessels, possibly of the Sailendra and Srivijaya thalassocracies. Shown with the characteristic tanja sail of Southeast Asian Austronesians. Prior to the 10th century, the route was primarily used by Southeast Asian traders, although Tamil and Persian traders also sailed them. By the 7th century CE, Arab dhow traders ventured into the routes, leading to the earliest spread of Islam into Southeast Asian polities. By the 10th to 13th centuries, the Song Dynasty of China started building its own trading fleets, despite the traditional Chinese Confucian disdain for trade. This was partly due to the loss of access by the Song dynasty to the overland Silk Road. The Chinese fleets started sending trading expeditions to the region they referred to as Nan hai (mostly dominated by the Srivijaya), venturing as far south as the Sulu Sea and the Java Sea. This led to the establishment of Chinese trading colonies in Southeast Asia, a boom in the maritime trade, and the emergence of the ports of Quanzhou and Guangzhou as regional trade centers in China. After a brief cessation of Chinese trade in the 14th century due to internal famines and droughts in China, the Ming dynasty reestablished the trade routes with Southeast Asia from the 15th to 17th centuries. They launched the expeditions of Zheng He, with the goal of forcing the \\"barbarian kings\\" of Southeast Asia to resume sending \\"tribute\\" to the Ming court. This was typical of the Sinocentric views at the time of viewing \\"trade as tribute\\", although ultimately Zheng He's expeditions were successful in their goal of establishing trade networks with Malacca, the regional successor of Srivijaya. 16th-century Vietnamese ceramics in Aichi, Japan. By the 16th century, the Age of Exploration had begun. The Portuguese Empire's capture of Malacca led to the transfer of the trade centers to the sultanates of Aceh and Johor. The new demand for spices from Southeast Asia and textiles from India and China by the European market led to another economic boom in the Maritime Silk Road. The influx of silver from the European colonial powers however, may have eventually undermined China's copper coinage, leading to the collapse of the Ming dynasty. The Qing dynasty initially continued the Ming philosophy of viewing trade as \\"tribute\\" to the court. However, increasing economic pressure finally forced the Kangxi Emperor to lift the ban on private trading in 1684, allowing foreigners to enter Chinese trading ports, and allowing Chinese traders to travel overseas. Alongside the official imperial trade, there was also notable trade by private groups, primarily by the Hokkien people. Archaeology The evidences of naval trade activities were shipwrecks recovered from the Java Sea ‚Äî the Arabian dhow Belitung wreck dated to c. 826, the 10th century Intan wreck, and the Western-Austronesian vessel Cirebon wreck dated to the end of the 10th century. Extent The trade route encompassed numbers of seas and ocean; including South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, Indian Ocean, Gulf of Bengal, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The maritime route overlaps with historic Southeast Asian maritime trade, Spice trade, Indian Ocean trade and after 8th century‚Äîthe Arabian naval trade network. The network also extend eastward to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea to connect China with the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.

R. Wilson, was a businessman with extensive interests in mining at Broken Hill, and a noted racehorse owner and breeder. History Wilson was born in County Tyrone, Ireland, a son of a civil engineer who with his wife and family emigrated to Australia when he was six years old. He grew up in the Geelong district, and as a young man travelled to New Zealand, then South Australia, where he was in business at Quorn and from there to Broken Hill, where he accumulated considerable wealth. In the early days of the Silverton mines he was appointed general manager of the Barrier Ranges Association, and was put in charge of the Day Dawn mine. He was a subscriber to the original float of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, whose success made many investors a great deal of money. Others on that prospectus were George McCulloch, Bowes Kelly, Harvey Patterson, William Jamieson, and others. In April 1886 Wilson succeeded A R Blackwood as a director of the B.H.P., and later that same year, as one of the few on the board with mining experience, was sent to the US to inspect various mines, and at his recommendation W H Patton (of the Consolidated Virginia Company, Comstock lode) was appointed. He was also responsible for recruitment of H. H. Schlapp. In 1891 Wilson was appointed chairman of the board, but resigned the following year when he left to visit Europe, and never rejoined the board. Wilson was also connected with the formation of the Silverton Tramway Company, the Broken Hill Water Supply Company, and other mining ventures in Broken Hill and Western Australia. He was to hold a considerable portfolio of mining shares to the time of his death. Wilson was a follower of horse racing; before moving to \\"The Barrier\\" he was secretary of the Quorn Jockey Club and an official with the Port Augusta Jockey Club, which may have been when he first came into contact with C. Leslie Macdonald, and after moving was a founder of the Barrier Ranges Jockey Club. but it was not until around 1885 that he became interested as a participant rather than a spectator. In 1890 he purchased the St Albans Stud, Whittington, near Geelong, from John Crozier, Jr. for a reputed ¬£75,000, around twice what Crozier had paid James Wilson (no relation) just four years earlier. He returned to live in Victoria, dividing his time between St Albans and Melbourne. Wilson went in for an extensive program of breeding, and his autumn sales of yearlings always realised good prices. He appointed Macdonald as manager of the St Albans stud. He imported the stallion Eiridspord, the St Simon mare Elsie (who won many races for him), the mares Eleusis, Beanfeast and Lady Marden from England, and later on the stallion Bill of Portland. One of his most successful sires was Trenton, which he purchased from the Hobartville Stud, and eventually sold to a breeder in England. In 1891 when the Sylvia Park stud of New Zealand was dispersed, Wilson purchased the mare Mersey (dam of Carbine) and her foal Carnage, out of Nordenfeldt, who would later win many good races for him. Wilson quit breeding and in 1895 dispersed the St. Albans Stud on the art union principle, but subsequently bought back the St Albans Estate, the horse Bill of Portland and several of his old mares, from the \\"lucky winners\\" at substantially below their valuation, and started breeding again. Wilson's horses had a great deal of success in some good races, but no winners in handicaps of the importance of the Melbourne or Caulfield Cups, though his Strathmore, Nada, Carnage, Aurum did run a place in the Melbourne Cup. His winners included: *Australian Cup: Havoc (1895); Bobadil (1899); and La Carabine (1900) *Caulfield Guineas: Strathmore (1891); Wallace (1895); Aurum (1897); and Bobadil (1898) *Victoria Derby: Strathmore (1891); Carnage (1893); and Wallace (1895) *VRC Champion Stakes: Strathmore (1892); Wallace and Quiver, a dead heat ‚Äî both Wilson entries (1896); and Bobadil (1899). *VRC Oaks: Eleusive (1897); and Symmetry (1898) *AJC St Leger: La Tosca (1892); and Wallace (1896) *VRC St Leger: Strathmore (1892); Aurum (1898); and Bobadil (1899) *Sydney Cup: Wallace (1896); and La Carabine (1900) H. J. Morrison was a jockey for Wilson; his father \\"Joe\\" Morrison was a trainer for Wilson and Macdonald. It was suggested on several occasions that Wilson stand for V.R.C. committee membership, but declined nomination. Wilson died at his home \\"Shanghai,\\" St. Kilda Road, after a few months' illness. When he knew death was imminent he gave instructions that his horses' racing engagements should not be disrupted, and his popular mare La Carabine which was entered for the Adelaide Cup and heavily backed by the public, was not scratched but ran, and came third. He was buried in the St. Kilda Cemetery, and was survived by his widow and a daughter (Mrs E Raleigh). His wife died in London two years later. > But as an owner of horses he merely sustained the reputation which he had > established in the \\"roaring days\\" of the Barrier ‚Äî the reputation of being a > large-hearted, open-handed man; full of enthusiasm; a straight-goer; one who > never forgot a kindness or remembered a wrong. Family William Robert Wilson (c. 1849 ‚Äì 28 May 1900) married Ada Wills (died 25 July 1879) on 20 November 1875. They had one daughter: *May Harriet Wilson (1876‚Äì ) married Ernest Raleigh (c. 1862 ‚Äì 3 July 1935) on 30 March 1898. They had a daughter on 4 February 1899. He was later married to Catherine Campbell Wilson (c. 1857 ‚Äì 25 April 1902). Harriet Wilson and Anna Maria Collier (of Manaia, New Zealand) were sisters. Samuel Rupert Wilson (1844 ‚Äì 6 August 1927), an engineer well-known in Broken Hill, was a brother. :He succeeded William Jamieson as manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary in 1886. He was manager for the Octagon Syndicate in Western Australia 1892‚Äì1896, and opened up the Great Fingall mine. He was a chairman of the Adelaide Racing Club, and of Tattersalls Club in Adelaide. As a racehorse owner in South Australia, he had several notable successes. Carrying his colours, Shareholder won the Silverton Cup, Exton the Grand National Hurdle Race, and Messenger the Onkaparinga Steeplechase. He married Mary Warren, daughter of Henry Warren and sister of Sarah Ann Warren; they had one son, Rupert Henry Wilson, and three daughters.

XXIX, Sevilla 1960, p. 114 His mission proved successful; though Mellista defection decimated Carlist ranks, Correo maintained loyalty to the claimant. Ferrer remained in close touch with his king; he used to travel to Paris for consultationsLa Correspondencia de Espa√±a 25.05.19, available here and in late 1919 took part in the massive gathering known as Magna Junta de Biarritz,La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 12.12.19, available here where he represented Castilla La Nueva.Juan Mar√≠a Roma (ed.), Album hist√≥rico del carlismo, Barcelona 1935, p. 285 He also toured Spain, trying to save what was left of the crumbling Carlist organisation.El Correo Espa√±ol 21.10.19, available here, also El Correo Espa√±ol 21.12.19, available here Ferrer's term in Correo lasted until mid-1920; it is not clear why he left the daily.in May 1920 Arsenio de Izaga became the new jefe of El Correo Espa√±ol, El Correo Espa√±ol 27.05.20, available here Dictatorship, Republic and War Don Jaime, 1920s It does not seem that Ferrer left Correo because of discrepancies with his king; quite to the contrary, in the movement plagued by defections and by some considered dead he remained among most loyal individuals and a bulwark against the Mellistas.Gambra 1979, p. 3 His position was confirmed when at unspecified time in the 1920swhen featured in Carlist press in 1927, Ferrer was listed simply as \\"ex-director of El Correo Espa√±ol\\" with no currently held function named, compare El Eco de Gerona 24.12.27, available here Ferrer became secretario pariculario ‚Äì sort of a personal secretary ‚Äì to Don Jaime himself. None of the sources consulted clarifies whether he moved to Paris when performing the new job, yet his contributions kept appearing in numerous dailieslike El Correo Catal√°n (Barcelona), El Pensamiento Navarro (Pamplona) and Gil Blas (Santander), contributing also to minor titles like Diario de Villanueva i Geltru, compare e.g. here and periodicals,like La Bandera Regional, La Trinchera, La Naci√≥, El Radical, El Guerillero, Patria, Espa√±a, Misi√≥n, Iberia, Gr√°fico Legitimista, La Protesta and Reacci√≥, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162 including the French ones.allegedly Ferrer contributed also to L‚ÄôAction Francaise and La Croix, see ABC 13.06.65, available here; however, a digital archive of both papers does not reveal any items signed by Ferrer, compare the Gallica service, available here Some scholars suggest he might have been involved in efforts to animate the Requet√© organisation across Spain and that Ferrer might have also contributed to loose preparations to stage an eventually cancelled Carlist anti-primoderiverista coup in Seu d‚ÄôUrgell in 1928; Ferrer himself points rather to his older brother Antonio.Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. XXIX, Sevilla 1960, pp. 177, 183‚Äì184 Another scholar claims that Ferrer remained the secretary of Don Jaime until the Carlist king passed away in late 1931.Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957‚Äì1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 41, Jacek Bartyzel, Melchor Ferrer, [in:] My≈õl Konserwatywna service 04.06.15, available here In late 1930 Ferrer assumed management of Diario Monta√±es,Heraldo de Madrid 03.11.30, available here a conservative Santander daily strongly flavored with Traditionalism. Circumstances of his appointment are not known; it is neither clear how it could have been reconciled with alleged work for Don Jaime. Ferrer's term in Santander lasted almost 5 years and seems rather successful, at least in terms of mobilizing support for the cause; during the Republican period the Cantabrian Carlism enjoyed its revival. Ferrer contributed also by attending various meetings, where he used to give lectures.El Siglo Futuro 04.02.32, available here In 1931 he published one of his few theoretical bookletstitled S√≠ntesis del programa de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Espa√±ola (Santander, 1932) and penned pieces to a Santanderine review Tradici√≥n. Apart from those discussing ideological threads, some were also his first incursions into the field of history, like piece on aristocratic titles conceded by Carlist monarchsMelchor Ferrer, Titulos Nobiliarios Carlistas, [in:] Tradici√≥n 28 (1934), pp. 89‚Äì91, available here or a summary of party's political leadership during the previous half a century.Melchor Ferrer, La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876, [in:] Tradici√≥n 37 (1934), pp. 296‚Äì302, available here Ja√©n (current view) In early 1935 Ferrer moved from the coast of Biscay to Andalusia, where he assumed management of the local daily Eco de Ja√©n.La Naci√≥n 14.01.35, available here A recently established newspaper, it was in fact successor to El Pueblo Cat√≥lico, a Traditionalist daily issued since 1893; the latter underwent ownership changes and finally closed, to be reborn under a new name.Ram√≥n Reig Garc√≠a, La comunicaci√≥n en Andaluc√≠a: historia, estructura y nuevas tecnolog√≠as, Sevilla 2011, , p. 121 When Ferrer took over the daily was still shaped by its previous Integrist heritage; Ferrer brought it fully into Carlist orthodoxy and converted into a modern newspaper. Like in Santander, he supported the Carlist buildup by attending local meetings and mobilizing support.ABC 17.11.35, available here It is not clear whether Ferrer contributed to or was even aware of the Carlist anti-Republican conspiracy; one author claims the 1936 coup caught him by surprise. Eco de Ja√©n operated until late July, when first its premises were ransacked and then the paper was turned into the mouthpiece of local Frente Popular.Antonio Checa Godoy, Prensa y partidos pol√≠ticos durante la II Rep√∫blica, Salamanca 1989, , p. 202 Having lost his job Ferrer was subject to unspecified persecution and harassment,Gambra 1979, p. 4 yet he survived the revolutionary terrorduring republican terror in Ja√©n popular tribunals sentenced 60 individuals to death and further 70 to lifetime incarceration in 1936 only; number of victims of extrajudicial repression is not known, Luis Garrido Gonz√°lez, Ja√©n y la guerra civil (1936‚Äì1939), [in:] Bolet√≠n. Instituto de Estudios Giennenses 198 (2008), p. 204 and following almost 3 years in the Republican zone endured to see Ja√©n captured by the Nationalists in late March 1939. Early Francoism Seville, early post-war period Shortly after the Nationalist takeover of Ja√©n Ferrer moved to Seville; the local Carlist daily La Uni√≥n was subject to heavy censorship measures and its head Domingo Tejera ceded management to Ferrer in hope to spare the newspaper. However, the Francoist structures were determined not to tolerate dissenting party titles and La Uni√≥n closed on 31 December 1939.Cristina Barreiro Gordillo, El carlismo y su red de prensa en la Segunda Rep√∫blica, Madrid 2003, , p. 320 Ferrer's position went from bad to worse when he refused to join the new state party, Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista, and its syndicate press structures; as a result, in 1941 he got his press license revoked.Bartyzel 2015 It is not clear how Ferrer made a living; at unspecified time he assumed teaching duties in the local Escuela N√°utica San Telmo and at preparatory courses to entry exams to military academies.like Academia Militar General in Zaragoza, aviation academy and army academy, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162 It is in the early 1940s that he started publishing Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol,the title is currently referred to either as \\"Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol\\" or \\"Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa√±ol\\". The original title was fully capitalised, hence it is difficult to ascertain which orthographic version is original a series which would become the source of income but which also in few years would earn him ‚Äì still fairly unknown in the Carlist realm across Spain ‚Äì enormous prestige nationwide. Since the mid-1940s Ferrer was taking part in resumed meetings of Consejo Nacional Carlista, the National Carlist executive. The nature of his mandate is unclear, as he did not held formal posts in the party structures;Gambra 1979, p. 1 it was probably related to his personal friendship with the Carlist leader Manuel Fal Conde, also resident of Seville. Confronted with growing fragmentation and bewilderment among the Traditionalists Ferrer maintained total loyalty to the regent Don Javier and used his pen to fight off competing factions. His 1946 booklet Observaciones de un viejo carlista a unas cartas del Conde de Rodezno was aimed against those advancing Don Juan as a legitimate Carlist heir. The 1948 booklet Observaciones de un viejo carlista sobre las pretensiones de un Pr√≠ncipe al trono de Espa√±a was aimed against Carloctavismo; offering \\"a ultranza\\" defense of the regency in insulting style Ferrer ridiculed Carlos VIII and the cause of \\"farsa carloenchufista que encubre un carlofascismo de ocasi√≥n\\".Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco, Madrid 2004, , p. 77 Acknowledging the apparent stabilization of the regimeduring one of the Carlist executive meetings of 1948 Ferrer reviewed different options: alliance with Franco, alliance with the Juanistas, popular rising against Franco, a coup d'etat against Franco, infiltrating official structures; he concluded that none of the options was viable, Josep Miralles Climent, La rebeld√≠a carlista.

He co-worked to prepare documents, made public during the Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona in 1952, which acknowledged Don Javier as a legitimist monarch.C√©sar Alcal√°, D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biograf√≠a pol√≠tica (1901‚Äì1980), Barcelona 2001, , p. 99 Unwavering loyalty to the Borb√≥n-Parmas, which was already becoming sort of Ferrer's trademark, was further demonstrated in a booklet released in 1955; anonymous though generally attributed to Ferrer, it was distributed by the Carlist academic youth mostly in Madrid. Designed as response to earlier Franco's meeting with Don Juan and increasing prospects of Alfonsists restoration,also as response to abusive public Franco's comments, which reduced Carlism to a bunch of offshoots following a foreign prince, almost traitors the booklet denounced such a possibility as treason to the spirit of July 1936, allegedly shaped by a pact between the Carlists and the military.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 377, Javier Lavard√≠n, Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de Espa√±a, Paris 1976, p. 19 Mid-Francoism Zamanillo Ferrer was very uneasy about 1955 Fal's dismissal from political leadership and pro-collaborationist turn of the party.Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El nuevo rumbo pol√≠tico del carlismo hacia la colaboraci√≥n con el r√©gimen (1955‚Äì56), [in:] Hispania 69 (2009), p. 190, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 40 During a 1956 meeting of the executiveLavardin 1976, p. 27 he warned about a forthcoming Franco-Juanista maneuver dubbed \\"Plan Artajo\\",V√°zquez de Prada 2009, p. 192, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 41 yet he remained totally loyal to his king, to the new strategy he sponsored and to the new party leader, Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente; he remained on fairly good terms with the latter.see e.g. friendly if not intimate letters exchanged between Valiente and Ferrer, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 91 In the late 1950s Ferrer's historiographic production assumed already massive scope and earned him enormous prestige in the party ranks. It was reflected by his continuous presence at executive sessions; in 1960 he was even entrusted with writing sort of a rulebook for organization of Consejo Nacional sittings.Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo 1962‚Äì1977, Pamplona 1997, , p. 84 In 1961 he entered a newly formed Comisi√≥n de Cultura; as censorship eased, he contributed to Comisi√≥n's mouthpiece Reconquista,V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 119 bulletins of Circulos V√°zquez de Mella and other new periodicals like Montejurra.also Informaciones, Cristiandad and Siempre, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162 Until the early 1960s Ferrer's actual impact on Carlist politics remained marginal;Ferrer \\"nunca se habia metido en pol√≠tica\\", V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 188 his position was rather this of a patriarch, scarcely involved in day-to-day business. This changed when discrepancies between the old Traditionalist guard and the unorthodox Carlist youth became visible. Ferrer tended to side with the latter, guided not that much by their theoretical innovations but rather by their absolute and unconditional loyalty to the Borb√≥n-Parmas. In 1961 he opposed attempts to set up a board co- ordinating Carlist propaganda,it might be interesting to note that back in 1935 Ferrer supported co-ordination of Carlist print activities, Francisco Javier Capistegui, Parad√≥jicos reaccionarios: la modernidad contra la Rep√∫blica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, [in :] Argonauta Espa√±ol 9 (2012), available here put forward by orthodoxes concerned with new tones advanced by periodicals like Azada y Asta.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 120 Ferrer remained also on excellent terms with leader of the youth, Don Javier's oldest son Don Carlos Hugo,Ferrer was \\"muy vinculado a Carlos Hugo e Irene\\", Lavardin 1976, p. 250 though initially he was perplexed by the bachelor status of the prince.conscious of dynastical problems caused resulting from Jaime III's lack of offspring, in 1961 Ferrer urged Junta Nacional to formally raise the issue with Don Carlos Hugo, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 145, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 76 When the Traditionalists, led by Jos√© Luis Zamanillo, started to mount an opposition strategy against the Huguistas, Ferrer did not hesitate to confront them. In 1962 he accused Zamanillo ‚Äì due to his requet√© past enormously respected in the party ranks ‚Äì of inactivity.Lavardin 1976, p. 143 Carlos Hugo (1964) In 1963 the showdown between Zamanillo-led Traditionalists and Mass√≥-led Huguista was already in full swing. Ferrer threw his authority behind the latter and released a memorandum,titled Breves consideraciones a una posici√≥n inadecuada adoptada por carlistas disidentes del dieciocho de julio charging Zamanillo and the review Siempre with mounting a pro-Juanista plot. Dubbing himself \\"the bellboy of Carlism\\" Ferrer noted he was happy to keep the door open for Zamanillo to leave,Lavardin 1976, pp. 148‚Äì149 in aggressive and mocking tone lambasting also other dissidents like Sivatte or Cora.e.g. he ridiculed Mauricio de Sivatte as \\"Su Alteza Real Don Mauricio\\" and mocked Jes√∫s Cora y Lira as \\"inventor de pretendientes m√°s conocido pos Su Excellencia Don Jes√∫s\\", dubbing both \\"pseudocarlistas\\". Some of those approached ‚Äì like del Mazo ‚Äì backtracked, but some ‚Äì like El√≠as de Tejada ‚Äì fought back, lambasting Ferrer's paper as \\"chabacanas majader√≠as\\", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 183‚Äì184 His stand might have tipped the balance; Zamanillo was expulsed and control of the party slipped to the Huguistas.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 188 Last years of Ferrer's life are marked by attempts to reinforce the position of Don Carlos Hugo. In 1964 he fathered a booklet intended to demonstrate the rights of Borb√≥n-Parmas to Spanish citizenship, a document the prince had in hand when talking to Franco.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 224; the document was partially based on legal opinions gathered earlier, Lavardin 1976, p. 211 Then he drafted analysis advancing their right to the Spanish throne;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 240 it was used during a grand Carlist gathering in 1965 in Puchheim, where Don Javier confirmed his royal claim.Lavardin 1976, p. 250 Ferrer himself was already unable to attend;Daniel Jes√∫s Garc√≠a Riol, La resistencia tradicionalista a la renovaci√≥n ideol√≥gica del carlismo (1965‚Äì1973) [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2015, p. 50 he was rewarded by Orden de la Legitimidad Proscrita, a high Carlist honor awarded by the claimants.Jos√© Carlos Clemente, El Carlismo en la Espa√±a de Franco: Bases Documentales 1936‚Äì1977, Madrid 1994, , p. 45, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162 Historian Domingo Tejera Ferrer was educated to be an engineer and his professional career is usually described as this of a periodista,Gambra 1979, p. 1 though perhaps not a very successful one.Gambra 1979, p. 2 He demonstrated no particular interest in history until in the mid-1930s he penned a few articles discussing the Carlist past,Melchor Ferrer, Titulos Nobiliarios Carlistas, [in:] Tradici√≥n 28 (1934), pp. 89‚Äì91 especially La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876.Melchor Ferrer, La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876, [in:] Tradici√≥n 37 (1934), pp. 296‚Äì302 According to some authors already during his idle years in Ja√©n of the Civil War he started gathering materials for a general history of Carlism.Canal 2000, p. 408 According to others he acted on suggestion of Fal Conde, who in 1939 proposed that to maintain Carlist identity in wake of political amalgamation into one Francoist state party, a general history of Carlism was badly needed.Mundet Gifre 1980, Gambra 1979, p. 5 One more group of scholars claim that Ferrer and his collaborators commenced their work to counter Historia de la guerra civil y de los partidos liberal y carlista by Antonio Pirala Criado, a 19th-century study which until 1939 was the only work serving as the overall history of the movement.Jos√© Ram√≥n Barreiro Fern√°ndez, O liberalismo nos seus contextos: un estado da cuesti√≥n, Santiago de Compostela 2008, , p. 39 In 1939 a former Carlist militant Roman Oyarzun published the first concise historiographic account of Carlism, Historia del Carlismo, yet his work was greeted with mixed feelings among the Carlists. Many considered Oyarzun's book an unorthodox attempt and were near to dismissing it altogether,Lopezarra [Francisco L√≥pez Sanz] following a spate of criticism concluded that at least Oyarzun \\"made an effort and his intention was good\\", quoted after Oyarzun 1944, p. 502, compare also his polemics with Traditionalist critics in the section Autocr√≠tica y cr√≠tica de los cr√≠ticos, Oyarzun 1944 still calling for sort of an \\"official\\" Carlist history. In 1941 Ferrer and two other Seville-based authors, Jos√© F. Acedo Castilla and Domingo Tejera de Quesada, published in the local Editorial Cat√≥lica Espa√±olaall series except volumes XII-XIII was issued by a Sevilla publishing house Editorial Cat√≥lica Espa√±ola the first volume of Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, intended as a general, in-depth history of Carlism. The team kept working on further volumes, though contribution of each of its members is difficult to gauge;in many brief references the whole series is attributed to Ferrer only, see. e.g. Mark Lawrence, Spain's First Carlist War, 1833‚Äì40, London 2014, , p. 17. Some highligt Ferrer and refer to Tejera and Acedo as \\"his collaborators\\", see e.g. A. J. P. Taylor, Oxford History of Modern Europe: The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1845‚Äì1918, London 1966, p. 702 Tejera passed away in 1944 yet all 11 volumes published until 1949 were attributed to all three authors. As Acedo left orthodox Carlism, starting volume XII Ferrer was named as the sole author. He managed to keep momentum and there were 18 volumes published in 15 years until 1956; during the following 5 years Ferrer completed subsequent 11 volumes, in 1960 releasing volume XXIX and bringing the narrative to the year of 1931. Carlist standard Ferrer kept working on consecutive volumes, yet he did not live to see them released.Ferrer was also planning to publish encyclopaedia of Carlism and the volume of material gathered is described as enormous, Canal 2000, p. 408. According to some, Diccionario hist√≥rico del carlismo by Josep Carles Clemente was a work which \\"ha realizado el proyecto que en su d√≠a inici√≥ Melchor Ferrer\\", see opinion of Manuel Martorell Perez at Pamiela publishing house website, available here. He left also a few manuscripts: Musa carlista: El tema carlista en la poesia, El pensamiento pol√≠tico del Conde de Montemol√≠n, Un pensador olvidado: Fray Magin Ferrer and Los bonos del Tesoro y las emisiones carlistas de deuda, Gambra 1979, p. 4 According to one author, the delay was caused by problems with censorship;Gambra 1979, p. 5 eventually volume XXX, covering the period of 1931‚Äì1936, was edited posthumously by Enrique Rold√°n Gonz√°lez and released in 1979, attributed to Ferrer only.Cain Som√© Laserna, El carlismo andaluz: estado de la cuesti√≥n, [in:] Alejandra Ibarra Aguirregabiria (ed.), No es pa√≠s para jovenes, Madrid 2012, , p. 9 In total Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol amounts to around 9,300 pages; each volume includes some 50‚Äì150 pages of documental appendices and a bibliography. The series clearly focuses on military history; the First Carlist War is covered in 15 volumes and the Third Carlist War is treated in 4 volumes, while 32 years in-between both conflicts deserved just 5 volumes; 33 years of 1876‚Äì1909 are discussed in just 1 volume and 22 years of 1909‚Äì1931 in another.I (1941): El pensamiento espa√±ol desde los tiempos de San Isidro hasta la sublevaci√≥n mas√≥nica de 1820; II (1941): El precarlismo.

They demonstrate that Ferrer nurtured a penchant for political theory, yet in history of Traditionalist thought he merits attention as perhaps the most eminent case of a Carlist thinker influenced by integral nationalism; the impact of L'Action Fran√ßaise is especially evident in Ferrer's earlier writings. From his youth Ferrer remained impressed by writings of Charles Maurras; his decision to join the French army in 1914 is at times attributed to Ferrer's admiration for the Frenchman and his concepts.for an overview of Maurras' reception in Spain see Miguel Ayuso, Una visi√≥n espa√±ola de la Acci√≥n francesa, [in:] Anales de la Fundaci√≥n Francisco El√≠as de Tejada 16 (2010), pp. 71‚Äì80, for Ferrer see p. 77 In general terms they prompted Ferrer to advocate renewal of Carlism; unlike many, he totally disregarded V√°zquez de Mella and considered Traditionalism of the 1920sthough some scholars see V√°zquez de Mella as one of the giants of Traditionalism and locate his most mature writings in the 1920s, at that time Ferrer was painfully aware of what he perceived a general crisis of Traditionalism, \\"en un momento en que el carlismo se hallaba en horas bajas, intelectual y pol√≠ticamente hablando, hasta la reemergencia en tiempos de la II Rep√∫blica, pod√≠a verse con envidia el bullicioso mundo intelectual que la Acci√≥n francesa hab√≠a logrado articular en su torno\\", Miguel Ayuso, Una visi√≥n espa√±ola de la Accion Francesa, [in:] Anales de la Fundaci√≥n Francisco El√≠as de Tejada 16 (2010), p. 77 stuck in Romanticism, old esthetics and 19-th century schemes.compare Melchor Ferrer, El valor positivo del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, [in:] Espa√±a 20.03.19, p. 7, available here His intention was to blend Traditionalism and modernity.Ferrer 1919, p. 7 Specifically, Ferrer tried to re-define the role of nation and state in the Carlist theoretical framework. Both concepts were usually neglected if not mistrusted by Carlist thinkers;However, others used the terms extensively in Carlist doctrine, see Jaime del Burgo Torres, Ideario Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Carlista, (1937), available here Ferrer considered them crucial for modern outlook and strove to ensure their central position within the Traditionalist ideological toolset.Ferrer 1919, p. 7 Indeed, some scholars consider him the disciple of Domingo Cirici Ventall√≥ and follower of his \\"espa√±olismo Catalan\\".Cirici considered Ferrer \\"a man with great political intuition\\", Maximiliano Garc√≠a Venero, Otro turno sore [sic!] el enemigo, [in:] Hoja oficial de la provincia de Barcelona, 29.12.41, available here In terms of economy Ferrer acknowledged collapse of the Liberal order, challenged by social utopias on the one hand and technocratic estatismo on another; his own recip√© was \\"reorganizaci√≥n corporativa\\".El Correo Espa√±ol 12.03.20, available here L'Action francaise poster In the 1930s Ferrer followed Maurras diagnosing that France was trapped in permanent parliamentarian crisis, longing for a strong executive.Melchor Ferrer, La inquietud Europea ante la Bancarota del Liberalismo, part I, [in:] Tradici√≥n 15.03.33, pp. 158‚Äì160, available here He shared anti-parliamentarian stand of the Nazis yet deplored their ethnicity-based nationalismaccording to Ferrer \\"making the moral unity of Europe still more distant\\" and drive for social engineering; Ferrer sympathized rather with Hugenberg.Ferrer appreciated Hugenburg and his party for perceived support for federative system and protection of ruralism, Ferrer 1933, p. 159 He preferred Italian Fascism, born out of fundamental opposition to the spirit of 1789, liberalism and individual rights and offering a syndical approach of concerting all social interests. However, he noted that armed with Traditionalism, Spain needed no foreign models;Melchor Ferrer, La inquietud Europea ante la Bancarota del Liberalismo, part II, [in:] Tradici√≥n 01.04.33, pp. 179‚Äì182, available here some see it as Ferrer's refusal to accept \\"f√≠sica social\\" of Comtean positivism, forming the basics of Maurras‚Äô integral nationalism.Gambra 1979, p. 4 Admirer of L'Action Fran√ßaise, Ferrer despised its Spanish copy, Acci√≥n Espa√±ola, and charged Carlists involved in the project, especially Pradera, with \\"tradicionalismo de corto alcance\\".Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 359. Ferrer developed general disregard for Pradera; in a 1952 letter to Fal he listed many offshoots as Carlist theorists, like Aparisi, Candido Nocedal, Ram√≥n Nocedal and Vazquez de Mella, but did not mention Pradera, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 401 Disdainful towards emerging Francoism, Ferrer thought it an anti-Traditionalist regime. In opposition to the new Cortes, considered born out of \\"origen revolucionario\\",Manuel de Santa Cruz, Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 4, Sevilla 1979, pp. 43‚Äì48 he specified his own vision of representation. It was to be based on regional diets, each composed of 4 separate chambers and constructed in line with local tradition.local Cortes in Castilla y Le√≥n, Navarra, Valencia, Arag√≥n or Catalonia and Juntas Generales in Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Alava They in turn were supposed to delegate members of the national diet;.each local diet should be composed of 4 chambers: camara ecclesiastica (specified religious men), c√°mara senatorial (specified nobles and aristocracy), c√°mara real (municipalities, aldeas, other) and c√°mara popular (all legally recognised organisations) its authority was to be limited to supra-regional issues like foreign affairs, army or money.Santa Cruz 1979, pp. 43‚Äì48 Reception and legacy thumb When in 1941 volume I of Historia went to print Ferrer was scarcely known beyond the realm of Catalan and Cantabrian Carlists; when in 1960 volume XXIX reached the market among the Carlists he was already the ultimate authority on the past; though there were controversies about treatment of particular episodes, the opus was accepted as sort an \\"official\\" Carlist history.Ferrer's history is still featured as sort of an official Carlist history, compare, the official site of Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, available here Among historians the reception of his work was mixed; massive scale of Ferrer's account earned respect, but especially the back matter raised many eyebrows. A fellow Carlist Jaime del Burgo judged harshly that Ferrer's approach to bibliography was excessively light and that he lacked sufficient source criticism;\\"quiz√° porque en ella Ferrer se mostr√≥ poco cr√≠tico y acept√≥ datos ajenos con excesiva ligereza y sin comprobaci√≥\\", quoted after Mundet Gifre 1980 a strict inspection revealed glaring errors in documents quoted and another scholar identified 64 inaccuracies on just 4 pages of one of the appendices, in 1967 delivering a damning judgement that Historia was \\"a work with no scientific value\\".\\"una obra sin ning√∫n val√≥r cient√≠fico\\", Josep Fontana L√°zaro, Una edici√≥n inadmisible: la de las memorias de hacienda de Garay, por el padre Federico Su√°rez Verdeguer, [in:] Moneda y Credito 100‚Äì103 (1967), p. 117 Today the adjective accepted almost unanimously when describing Historia is \\"monumental\\".\\"monumental historia\\" ‚Äì Mundet Gifre 1980, \\"esta obra es el monumental trabajo\\" ‚Äì R.S.H. 1980, p. 161, \\"realmente monumental\\" ‚Äì Gambra 1979, p. 5, \\"monumental obra\\" ‚Äì Rafael Quirosa-Cheyrouze y Mu√±oz, Cat√≥licos, mon√°rquicos y fascistas en Almer√≠a durante la Segunda Rep√∫blica, Almeria 1998, , p. 49, \\"monumental\\" ‚Äì Canal 2000, p. 407, \\"monumentalna\\" ‚Äì Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez boga, nic wbrew tradycji, Radzymin 2015, [furtherly referred as Bartyzel 2015b], p. 17, \\"monumental Historia\\" ‚Äì Jos√© Luis Agud√≠n Men√©ndez, ¬øUna libertad para todos?

He is known for his examination and exploration of the sciences of the Qur'an. The ustad leads the Ar-Rahman Qur'anic Learning Center (AQL) Islamic Center, and also serves as the Secretary General of Intellectual Assembly of Young Ulama Indonesia (MIUMI), Chairman of Alumni of Saudi Arabia in Indonesia, and Chairman of Islamic University of Medina Alumni in Indonesia. He also served as the Central Executive of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). Nasir often appeared on national television and was a judge on Hafidz Indonesia Event with Ustad Amir Faishol Fath and Syeh Ali Jabeer. His prominence further increased when, as leader of the National Movement of Fatwa Guards Majelis Ulama Indonesia (GNPF-MUI), he spearheaded a protest movement that commenced in November 2016 with the aim of thwarting the re-election bid of then-Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. Early life He completed his secondary education at Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor in Ponorogo, East Java and Pondok Pesantren Daarul Huffazh in Bone, South Sulawesi. He continued his studies at the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia. Role in anti-Ahok protests Nasir was a prominent figure in the organization of a series of protests staged in Jakarta from November 2016 against then-Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, who was accused of blasphemy. The initial protest involved approximately 50,000 to 200,000 participants.\\"Indonesia protest: President Joko Widodo cancels Australia visit\\". BBC News. 5 November 2016. Nasir led the protest movement under the National Movement of Fatwa Guards of the Indonesian Ulema Council (GNPF-MUI). Ahok subsequently lost his bid for re-election in 2017 and was jailed for two years for blasphemy. Media reports described the blasphemy charge as \\"trumped up\\" and part of a wider effort to discredit Ahok's ally, President Joko Widodo, ahead of Indonesia's 2019 presidential election. Controversies Nasir was accused of racism after an interview with Reuters news agency, during which he called the ethnic Chinese minority's wealth in Indonesia a problem of economic inequality that needs to be addressed. \\"It seems they have not become more generous and juster,\\" he said. In the interview, Nasir also criticized the amount of investment from China which he considered less helpful.Indonesian Islamist leader says ethnic Chinese wealth is next target. Reuters. Retrieved 9-11-2017. Critics responded that the minority ethnic group does not receive any special treatment from the government and that Nasir was exploiting social inequality as a weapon to incite hatred and scapegoat Indonesia's ethnic Chinese. In May 2019, police named Nasir a suspect in a money laundering case involving the transfer of funds from the Justice for All Foundation (YKUS). Nasir failed to comply with a third police summons for questioning that month, as he had gone to Saudi Arabia.

John worked with Joseph Reid Anderson and Anderson's father-in-law, Dr. Richard S. Archer, to form J. R. Anderson and Company. They produced iron for the Louisiana sugar mills. The company formed into the Tredegar Iron Works Company by 1841. John secured a job for his son at the iron company. Civil War Tanner was employed as a bookkeeper for the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond. Tanner was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Letcher Artillery in 1862. After his service in 6th Virginia Infantry, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in the 2nd Virginia Infantry. On September 29‚Äì30, 1864, Tanner fought at Battle of New Market Heights as part of the Siege of Petersburg. Tanner and Delaney Col. W. E. Tanner was the head and manager of iron manufacturer companies. He dedicated his life to the iron works field. In 1867, Tanner & Delaney was founded at the junction of Canal Street and Seventh street. It was said that every Virginian had a pride for Richmond. Tanner used the Second Industrial Revolution to recover the war-torn city. They relocated on twelve acres of land on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Tanner & Delaney became one of the largest and well-equipped American Engine-works. The company was in the form of a hollow square with three sides accompanied with running water, lakes, shrubbery, and flowers. The summit of a one-hundred foot tower contained a tank of 25,000 gallons of water. A waterhose was available to put out flames. The brick buildings were of a stylish design. The \\"Staunton Spectator\\" claimed that the secret behind the success of Tanner and Delaney was Tanner's \\"talents, sagacity, and fine business qualifications.\\" It was said that his traits were showcased in all aspects of the bold and successful enterprise. The newspaper closed with, \\"Richmond may well be proud of such a son.\\" A factory was set up in the Shockoe Warehouse on 13th Street in 1868, in the building formerly occupied by sword manufacturers,Edwin Boyle and Thomas Gamble.

Tanner and Bradley Tyler Johnson ran for the historic 7th Senate District (Richmond and Henrico) in 1875. Both men were critics of the postwar policies; however, they still attempted to gain the vote of African- American Republicans. Johnson and Tanner gained support with white Redeemers and initially the Readjuster Party. It appeared that the Democrats would win the black vote. Two Independents, however, wanted to retain the postwar policies. William Carter Knight and Patrick Henry Starke declared their candidacy on the Sunday before Election Day. Knight and Starke were essentially Republicans. They could not call themselves \\"Republicans\\" and win white ex-Confederates. Johnson organized campaign groups of African-Americans \\"at very considerable expense.\\" These were nicknamed \\"Johnson clubs.\\" After the Democrats lost the black vote, they claimed their opponents engaged in electoral fraud. Knight and Starke supporters allegedly paid $15 to $50 to African-American voters. All African-Americans abandoned Tanner and Johnson to vote for Knight and Starke. The Democrats still defeated the Independent candidates. As Senator, Tanner visited Washington, D.C. in February, 1876. He attended the seventh annual ball of Columbia Commandery with the Knights Templar. Tanner was disgraced in 1878 after his prosecution, alongside T. C. Wilkinson and John Enders Robinson, after they unnecessarily left on their waterhose at their residence.\\"Police Court Yesterday.\\" Daily Dispatch. [Richmond] 23 July 1878 Contribution to the arts In 1879, Tanner and his wife traveled from Richmond to see the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston. Tanner was referred as \\"one of our most critical lovers of good music.\\" He bought a Knabe full concert grand piano with the finishings from Ramos and Moses. Freemasonry Tanner's association with freemasonry dated back at least to the Civil War. When the Union Army reached an abandoned and burning Richmond in 1865, the city was conquered by looters, vandals, and mobsters. Mason's Hall was threatened with destruction by the angry mobs. An unnamed colonel and Fraternity member found emblems over the door of the hall. He haulted his army in order to save the hall from the criminals. Tanner, Past Master of No. 10, was ordered to gather a meeting at the Lodge. The general and their Masonic comrades gathered. Tanner persuaded the Unionists agreed to assist widows and orphans of Confederate Masons. The mob violence decreased, and Tanner was credited as the peacemaker between the opposing parties. Tanner became prominently associated with the Masonic organizations of Richmond. He most closely aligned himself with the Grand Bodies of the State. Tanner's masonic connections were spread nationally, particularly in Providence and Boston. Education Tanner became an advocate for higher education. In 1883, the University of Virginia introduced the Tanner medal. The medal was awarded by Greek language professors to their best graduate students. Tanner donated $250 to the university to yield $15 a year. He dedicated the medal to his late parents, whom both died earlier in the decade. The Tanner medal was in the shape of a Grecian helmet inscribed with the figure of Athena presenting a crown and the legend. Tanner corresponded with William B. Taliaferro late in the year. Taliaferro similarly was a war veteran whom joined the board of the College of William and Mary and the Virginia Military Institute.Johnson, Anne and Tom Scott. \\"William Booth Taliaferro Papers, 1811-1954.\\" The College of William and Mary.

Page 4 His decision to start the locomotive works brought Richmond out of her tumultuous past. Minnesota Car Company In 1888, Tanner moved from Richmond to New York City for business in the railroad supply business. He did not stay a year in New York. Tanner moved to Duluth to work at the Minnesota Iron-Car Company. J. F. S. Anderson was president of the Minnesota Car Company; G. H. White was the superintendent and Tanner was the Vice President. Tanner purchased 2,000 tons of iron in St. Paul and Minneapolis in October, 1888. The Burton Electric Company Tanner was in Duluth, but his interests remained in Richmond. By 1888, Tanner was President of The Burton Electric Company. The company pioneered commodities, such as electric light, electric heating, and electric power. The Duluth Evening Herald noted that Tanner's electric company had effectively invented such heating for the railroad car. The company had even demonstrated their product on the Richmond cars. The company would conduct further and more exhaustive tests on the cars of the Northwest. Eickemeyer dynamo will be located in the baggage car and be driven by an engine with steam from the boiler of the locomotive. This operation was conducted on Pullman vestibule trains for one- third of a year. The acquisition of the appropriate current heaters is claimef to be solved. The dynamo to be will have such a capacity that there will be a surplus of current. Later life Tanner was not completely comfortable in Michigan. He was a man of the South and longed to return to his old state. In November, 1889, Col. Tanner visited Richmond and other Eastern cities. Tanner returned to Richmond in 1892 to participate in the unveiling of the A. P. Hill monument in the Hermitage Road Historic District. It was said that he was one of many aids who wore red sashes. He marched with Virginian veterans, such as Henry Heth and William Henry Palmer. Personal life Tanner married Mary Mildred Mallory. They had their first son, Charles Wortham, in 1858. Their first daughter, Helen Lauren, was born in 1862. Tanner's next child, Harriet Maxwell, was born in 1866. They had another child, William E., in 1868.

In 1946, he was also the founding vice-president of the Acad√©mie Charles-Cros. Also passionate about cinema, Panigel worked for French television, as music producer, film director and television presenter for numerous programs: notably Au cin√©ma ce soir which presented a film preceded by a montage of news from the time of its release, and ', which today constitutes a considerable mine of interviews with the greatest French directors who were his contemporaries; but also Cin√©ma-Variations, Ce jour-l√†, j'en t√©moigne : chroniques du temps de l'ombre 1940-44 (Histoire de la R√©sistance) and Portraits de cin√©astes et de musiciens (1964‚Äì82). In 1985, he created the in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, a group of scholarship specialists in his favourite fields and concerned by the transmission of the memory of the great interpretations of the past to as many people as possible, thus sharing 60 years of its private collections: more than 200,000 classical records, 40,000 films and 160,000 books on music and cinema. In the same spirit of safeguarding cultural heritage, he also pursued a career as a publisher, notably as director of series at R√©gie-Cassette-Vid√©o,R√©gie-Cassette-Vid√©o on data.bnf.fr where he established la M√©moire du cin√©ma, and founding director of R√©√©ditions d'enregistrements du domaine public (LPs) of classical music, dedicated to la M√©moire de la musique. In addition to this already very dense career, Armand Panigel also held the following positions: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of \\"√âditions et impressions de la Cin√©matographie fran√ßaise (1962‚Äì64)\\", pr√©sident of the Commission d' du cin√©ma (1975‚Äì76), Member of the Board of Directors of the association des auteurs de films, Director of collections of classical music CDs (1993‚Äì95). His career has been rewarded with his promotion to the rank of officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He was also the author of several reference books on music and cinema. In 1994, fascinated by new technologies, he began producing and directing CD-ROMs, \\"because it is a three-dimensional work, combining sound, image and text: it is the dream of my life,\\" he declared to the AFP one year before his death.

The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum exhibits the same photograph. It was photographed by Yoshito Matsushige. A journalist's legs were included to provide context to the scene. Human Shadow Etched in Stone ( hitokage no ishi) is an exhibition at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. It is thought to be the residue of a person who was sitting at the entrance of Hiroshima Branch of Sumitomo Bank when the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. It is also known as Human Shadow of Death.  Background  According to the museum, it is thought that the person had been sitting on the stone step waiting for the bank to open when the heat from the bomb burned the surrounding stone white and left their shadow. A black deposit was also found on the shadow. A piece of stone containing the artifact (3.3 meters wide by 2 meters high) was cut from the original location and moved to the museum. In January 1971, the museum acquired the stone on which the human shadow had become indistinct due to weathering. In April 1975, the museum began research into preserving the shadow. In 1991, the museum reported that earnest investigation of preservation methods had commenced. At present, the stone is surrounded by glass. It is thought that the person depicted in the stone died immediately with the flash of the atomic bomb, or after falling down after the explosion. Some people stated that they saw the person sitting at the entrance just before the bombing. A former soldier testified that he had recovered the person's body. However, the person's identity is still unknown. As of 2016, the museum exhibit states that \\"Several people have suggested that the person could be a member of their family\\". In the past, the museum exhibit contained a statement that the person was a 42-year-old woman named Mitsuno Koshitomo (Ë∂äÊô∫„Éü„ÉÑ„Éé). As a result of these previous statements, some conclusions in the literature state that she was the person depicted in the stone. According to museum staff, many visitors to the museum believe that the shadow is the outline of a human vaporized immediately after the bombing. However, the possibility of human vaporization is not supported from a medical perspective. The ground surface temperature is thought to have ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius just after the bombing. Exposing a body to this level of radiant heat would leave bones and carbonized organs behind. While radiation could severely inflame and ulcerate the skin, complete vaporization of the body is impossible.

The current location of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Hiroshima Branch is Kamiya-cho 1 Chome. The bank was built in 1928. It was designed by at the department of engineering of Sumitomo Group (now Nikken Sekkei), and was constructed by the Obayashi Corporation. The building was constructed out of reinforced concrete, with four floors above ground and one below with an open ceiling up to the third floor. The rooms for business, reception and coinage were on the first floor, the meeting rooms and cafeteria on the fourth floor, and the boiler room in the basement. It was built south of the head office of Geibi Bank (Now head office of ,) which had been built the year before and was almost the same size. It was designed in a general Romanesque architectural style, and was characterized by a large arch with molding on its front facade. It was not totally destroyed in the bombing of August 6, 1945. While the interior was destroyed, the exterior remained. The coin room was not damaged, and the cash and passbooks remained. Papers inside the building were blown as far away as by the blast. On the morning of the bombing, the bank was to be open as usual. Most of the employees were on their way to the office when the bomb was dropped. There were 29 employees killed immediately (including those in the branch and those on their way to work), 40 were injured and none missing. Some of the survivors died within a few days from radiation sickness, while others worked until retirement. Passersby took refuge in the building as it was close to ground zero, and a large number of bodies were recovered. The branch reopened after the war, and the entrance soon became a famous landmark of the damage caused by the atomic bombing. It was officially recognized by Hiroshima City as an A-bomb site. In those days, the shadow was called \\"Human Shadow of Death\\". According to a testimony, it was the second most famous sight next to the Atomic Bomb Dome. Sumitomo Bank went to great lengths to preserve the shadow. In 1959 they built a fence surrounding the stone, and in 1967 they covered the stone with tempered glass to prevent deterioration. In 1971, the Hiroshima Branch was planned to be rebuilt. The stone around the shadow was cut out and donated to the museum.  Human vaporization  According to (1947‚Äì), a radiology scientist, in his childhood he heard that the shadow had been generated by \\"human vaporization\\". \\"Journal on the damage of atomic bombing in Hiroshima\\" (Â∫ÉÂ≥∂ÂéüÁàÜÊà¶ÁÅΩË™å), published by Hiroshima City in 1971, also contains a description implying human vaporization, which is now proven to be impossible. In the 1994 Committee on Health and Welfare of the House of Councillors, mentioned the stone, saying \\"One was vaporized and vanished immediately. Only the shadow remained.\\"  See also  * Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum * Tomb of the Unknown Soldier  Notes   References   External links  * Damage by the Heat Rays/Human Shadow Etched in Stone ‚Äì Hiroshima City * Is it true that human beings vanished in the bomb's heat? ‚Äì Chugoku Shimbun Stone (material) Monuments associated with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Buildings and structures completed in 1928 Unidentified decedents Monuments and memorials in Japan Peace monuments and memorials ","title":"Human Shadow Etched in Stone"},{"id":"55204890","text":"Babcock is an unincorporated community in Miller County, in the U.S. state of Georgia.

In addition to its use for fighting, or in wars, the bladed weapons have been the object of special considerations forming part of funerary rituals, mythology and other ancestral traditions.  History  The present chronology is a compilation that includes diverse and relatively uneven documents about different families of bladed weapons: swords, dress-swords, sabers, rapiers, foils, machetes, daggers, knives, arrowheads, etc..., with the sword references being the most numerous but not the unique included among the other listed references of the rest of bladed weapons.  Bronze Swords  Swords found next to Nebra sky disk The first known bronze swords with a length equal to or greater than 60 cm date from the 17th century BC in regions of the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. To make a sword useful in combat, you must have a correct alloy, give it the right shape and apply the necessary thermal (and finishing) treatments. The longer a sword, the stresses (bending and buckling) are more important. What is needed is a weapon that is hard enough (to cut), fairly flexible (without being fragile) and quite durable enough to withstand blows. The manufacturing process is summarized as follows: The bronze swords were cast into moulds, heated to a certain temperature and allowed to cool slowly. Finally they cold hammered (hitting them with a hammer on a type of anvil) to increase its hardness. * c.1275 BC. Assyrian sword, with inscriptions.Assyrian sword. * c.650 BC.

Battle of Cannae Polybius described the swords of the Iberians (good for cutting and thrusting) and those of the Gauls (good for cutting). * 197 BC. The Gauls were defeated by the Romans, led by Gaius Cornelius Cetegus near the River Clusius (perhaps the current Brembo River). In spite of the numerical superiority of the Gauls, their swords were bent at the first blow and had to be straightened. The Romans took advantage of this weakness to win the battle. * c.20 BC. Diodorus Siculus was a Greek historian of Sicily that lived in Century I BC contemporary of Julius Caesar and Augustus. His comments on the celtiberian swords indicate the cut quality and an aspect of their manufacture. * c.5 BC. Gratio Falisco, in his poem Cynegeticon, mentions the knives of Toledo: \\"... Ima toledano praecingunt ilia cultro ...\\" * c.50.

The following is a list of characters from the Trinity Seven manga series. Main characters Arata Kasuga ; : :Main protagonist of the series and the of the Superbia archive, possessing the ability to nullify and copy magic. After a Breakdown Phenomenon destroys his hometown and causes his cousin Hijiri to disappear (but not before giving him her grimoire), Arata becomes determined to save her by becoming a magus and transferring to the Royal Biblia Academy where he meets the Trinity Seven. He usually speaks in a somewhat perverted manner and is calm in dealing with adversity (and often breaks the fourth wall). He is often referred to as the \\"Demon Lord Candidate\\" because only those mages of Demon Lord-class are able to create worlds, but actually the world he created was merely a wish that he had made with the grimoire to return the world the way it was. As a mage researches the one thing that is the farthest away from them, his thema is Impel (, Control). =Sora= ; : :She is the grimoire that Arata holds. She was called as Sora by Hijiri before she is given to Arata and before the Breakdown Phenomenon. Arata ordered her to bring back his normal days in his desperation, and she recreates the world in a different dimension, posing as Hijiri until Lilith's arrival. She is also known as . It is rumored that she had knowledge from other worlds. =Ilia= ; : :She is another grimoire that Arata holds and was called as Ilia. She took on Hijiri's memories and appearance and acted as a substitute. Whenever Hijiri was out of the house on magus duty, she would take her place and cook for Arata or do the household chores. She later submitted herself to Arata in order to escape the world that she created to trap Mira and Arata. She is also known as . Hijiri Kasuga ; : :Disguised as Arata's cousin, she was a magus before she was engulfed by the Breakdown Phenomenon that Arata created. Later, she was 'reborn' to become the member of Iscariot, which seeks to destroy the cycle of the Demon Lord and the Trinity Seven, destroying the world and the rebirth of the world. Although she becomes Arata's enemy, she still values Arata more highly than anything and wishes to make a world Arata could enjoy freely. She is referred to as the \\"Fallen Saint\\" by Anastasia-L during their encounter. She is a magus of the Ira (Wrath) archive with the themas Ruina (Ruin or Destruction), Partum (Birth or Creation), and Analysis (Disassembly). Trinity Seven =Lilith Asami= ; : :She is the Trinity Seven of Luxuria (Lust) and her magic Outer Alchemic () materializes in the form of a gun which comes in two versions: a short pistol that she utilizes in close quarter combat and a long rifle that resembles an anti-tank gun which she uses at long range. Although she is the same age as Arata and wears the same uniform as the rest of the female students of Royal Biblia Academy, she is actually a teacher of the academy. She is the first magus to appear in front of Arata during the Black Sun gravitational phenomenon incident in Arata's world where she was sent to investigate it; this incident eventually led her to introducing him to the academy. She becomes one of his earliest allies and friend, watching and supporting him in any way, though at times she becomes an unwitting victim of his unintended and indirect perversion. As she is rather prudish, her thema is Abies (, Life) from the Luxuria (Lust) archive. According to Hijiri, she is considered a prodigy and is the youngest to join the Trinity Seven. =Arin Kannazuki= ; : :She is the Trinity Seven of Ira (Anger) and user of Chaotic Rune magic, whose appearance is strikingly similar to Hijiri. She has a stoic personality where she has no reservation or shame about doing what she wants in front of Arata. She was first seen naked in the boys' bathroom when Arata went in for a bath. She is also the Demon Lord's partner, becoming an early ally and later close friend to Arata. She claims herself to be Arata's wife as he is the Demon Lord candidate. As she only shows little emotion much less and can't even imagine destructive anger, her thema is Ruina (, Ruin or Destruction) from the Ira (Anger) Archive. Her magic Chaosic Rune (), allows her to put up barriers and create destruction. =Levi Kazama= ; : :She is a ninja and the Trinity Seven of Invidia, as well as a student at the Royal Biblia Academy. As a user of Shamanic Spells (), she is considered to be one of the world's top five fighters, becoming one of Arata's earliest allies. She is the only member of the Trinity Seven that hasn't been seen naked by Arata, and her naked body is considered by Arata to be his \\"final frontier\\". She often desires to fight Akio in a one-on-one fight, but has never had the opportunity to do so. Due to being a ninja, who often works alone, she doesn't expect anything from others and thus her thema is Expectatio (, Expectation) from the Invidia (Envy) Archive. =Mira Yamana= ; : :She is the Head of Grimoire Security (, lit. \\"Royal Library censor(ate)\\") and one of the Trinity Seven. She treats Arata with hostility, but later warms up to Arata during the investigation of the Liber Academy's disappearance where they are stuck in the world created by Ilya. Her orb is her grimoire. Her thema is Justitia (Justice), which is part of the Superbia (Pride or hubris) archive, like Arata. It allows her to activate the \\"Gehenna Scope\\" () which she uses to analyse and counter any magic. =Akio Fud≈ç= ; : (drama CD), Ry≈çka Yuzuki (anime); Patricia Duran (English) :Akio Fudo is the partner of Mira in operating Grimoire Security as well as a member of the Trinity Seven. She was a spriggan (, secret treasure priestess) who lived in a town that rested underneath the Sky Library, guarding it; however, the Demon Lord from another world, Abyss Trinity, used the weapons of the Sky Library to destroy the city. Her mother had sufficient power to save only one person and chose Akio, making her the only survivor of her home town. In the process, she lost her faith, so that her thema is Fides (, Faith), which is part of the Gula (Gluttony) archive. Her magic Mantra Enchant () gives her superior physical skills, which she uses for close combat. =Yui Kurata= ; : :She is a special magus who lives in the dungeon underneath the academy and is also a member of the Trinity Seven. She is first introduced when she saves Arata from being killed by Akio by teleporting him to her dream world. She helped him to understand magic by explaining to him the concept of archives and themas. Later, when she was rescued by Arata and other Trinity Seven members, Yui is able to return to a normal life with other people and Levi as her close friend. She constantly shows her affection to Arata. She is known to be a Cardinal-Class magus, second only to the Biblia Academy headmaster. As she secludes herself from others, her thema is Amicitia (, Friendship), which is part of the Avaritia (Greed) archive. Her magic Arch Symphony () allows her to boost the magic of others. =Lieselotte Sherlock= ; : :She is the older twin sister of Selina who vanished in a school library six months before Arata enrolled at this school. She is the last of the Trinity Seven to meet Arata. At first, she was opposed by the other members of the Trinity Seven because she infiltrated the forbidden library, which is the 'eternal library', and obtained the Demon Lord element sealed in the library to become the Demon Lord candidate. After being defeated during the attack on the academy, Arata rescues her from the time dimension she is trapped in during the investigation on the Sky Library. She, like Arata and the principal, speak in a somewhat perverted manner. As a restless girl, her thema is Stagna (, Stagnation), which is part of the Acedia (Sloth) archive. Her magic Logos Art (, numerology) allows her to steal the magic of others. Supporting characters Selina Sherlock ; : :She is the younger twin sister of Lieselotte, and student reporter in Royal Biblia Academy. Because her elder sister is a member of Trinity Seven, Selina becomes closely affiliated with some of the other members and later Arata as well. Her thema is Ligare (, Bind). Headmaster ; : :He is a Paladin-Class mage and is the headmaster who presides over the Biblia Magic Academy. He usually speaks in somewhat a relaxed and perverted manner. Early in the series, he is said to be one of the five most powerful mages in the world. Master Liber ; : :She is a Paladin Class mage and headmaster of Royal Liber Academy, which has been destroyed. She is the head and a member of the Iscariot Abyss Trinity ; : :He is the Crimson Demon Lord and the Demon Lord of Luxuria. He is Lilith's father, which gave Lilith her Demon Lord element. Lugh ; : :She is a member of Iscariot, magus of the Invidia Archive and a thief. Lilim ; : :A girl who appeared when Arata touched Lilith's \\"Hermes Apocrypha\\" Grimoire. She calls Arata and Lilith \\"Papa\\" and \\"Mama.\\" Last Trinity ; : :He is the head of the Eternal Library, the White Demon Lord. He was brought into existence solely to fight Arata, the Demon Lord candidate. He can cause Breakdown Phenomena, and plots to destroy the world. Anastasia-L ; : :She is a mysterious girl from the Royal Akasha Academy who Arata meets and becomes captivated by during the Biblia Academy school festival. Eventually, she is later revealed to be a former Akasha student who died and recently became resurrected. She is referred to as the \\"Saint of Resurrection\\" by Hijiri and referred to Hijiri as the \\"Fallen Saint\\" during their encounter during the Biblia Academy school festival. Her thema is Terminus (, Demise). Master Akasha ; : :The principal of the Royal Akasha Academy. Works alongside Anastasia=L.

(October 2017). \\"Possible hominin footprints from the late Miocene (c. 5.7 Ma) of Crete?\\". Proceedings of the Geologists' Association. 128: 697‚Äì710 ‚Äì via Science Direct. Researchers describe the tracks as representing at least one apparent hominin or an unknown primate. The stratum in which the footprints were found was dated to about 5.7 million years ago, which predates the previously earliest discovered hominin footprints by about two million years. The researchers of the tracks suggest that it may imply the possibility of hominin evolution outside of Africa, contrary to current hypotheses.  Discovery and characteristics  The tracks were originally discovered by Gerard D. Gierli≈Ñski in 2002. During a visit to Trachilos, Gierli≈Ñski found the tracks, and as he was not planning on staying in Trachilos, Gierli≈Ñski recorded the footprints to later investigate them in the future. In 2010, he returned to Trachilos with other researchers to explore the tracks in detail. The tracks were dated by using the underlying rock bed, predominantly sedimentary, and foraminifera, a type of algae that lives on sea floor. The study explains, \\"The coastal rocks at Trachilos[,] lie within the Platanos Basin, and present a succession of shallow marine late Miocene carbonates and siliciclastics[...] At the top, this marine succession terminates abruptly in the coarse-grained terrigenous sedimentary rocks of the Hellenikon Group[.]\\" The study continues, stating that the sedimentary rocks would have been created around 5.6 million years ago, at the time of the Messinian salinity crisis (mya). The researchers also found evidence of foraminifera, which were dated at 8.5 mya and 3.5 mya. Given the date of the sedimentary rocks and the foraminifera samples, the researches created an approximate interval of 8.5 mya to 5.6 mya. As the rock sediment containing the tracks resembled that of Hellenikon minerals, the tracks were estimated to be 5.7 mya within the given interval. The footprints were measured to be 94 mm (millimeters) to 223 mm long and determined to be oriented in a south-west direction. There are clear pressure indexes, resembling that of a modern homo sapien plantigrade structure. The researchers also determined the presence of five digits in the imprints, classifying the track maker as pentadactyl, and lacking claws. As there was no visible evidence of forelimbs from the tracks, the track maker was identified as bipedal. Through 3-D printing and laser scanning, there are impressions found which indicate a ball region, a pulling up motion of the foot, a hallux, and small possible gaps between the first and other digit impressions. Poorly preserved prints lack these gaps however. The lateral digit impressions become progressively smaller so that the digital region as a whole is strongly asymmetrical. The impression of the hallux has a narrow neck and bulbous asymmetrical distal pad, indicating that the tracks were entaxonic. Morphometric analysis showed the footprints to have outlines that are distinct from modern non-hominin primates and resemble those of hominins. While younger than fossil records of hominins such as Sahelanthropus, found in Chad and dated around seven million years ago, the discovery potentially challenges the generally accepted theory that all early hominins were only present in Africa.G. D. Gierlinski, et al. Possible hominin footprints from the late Miocene (c. 5.7 Ma) of Crete?. Proc. Geol. Assoc (2017), https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pgeola.2017.07.006 Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319411867_Possible_hominin_footprints_from_the_late_Miocene_c_57_Ma_of_Crete [accessed Sep 11, 2017]. The print morphology suggests that the trackmaker could be a basal member of the clade Hominini, but as Crete is some distance outside the known geographical range of pre-Pleistocene hominins, researchers say that there is also a possibility that they represent a hitherto unknown late Miocene primate that convergently evolved human-like foot anatomy.  News and controversy  When Gierli≈Ñski and his team tried to publish the study, they received harsh criticism due to the findings going against the widely accepted hypothesis of early hominins or primates evolving in Africa alone. According to the study, the Trachilos footprints may represent an early hominin or primate species that may have evolved hominin-like feet independently, outside of Africa. This suggests the possibility of convergent evolution. The theory of convergent evolution suggests the possibility of two or more different species adapting similar traits and characteristics to each other, resulting in a similar species.Kirk, John Thomas Osmond (2007). Science & Certainty. Csiro Publishing. pp. pg. 79. . However, the theory is not well supported in this case, as there is no concrete evidence to suggest the theory results in perfect copies of traits or a whole species. As convergent evolution is not scientifically supported, there were doubts if the tracks were footprints at all. This resulted in rejections from many scientific journals when offered to publish the study's findings. In an interview at the CBC News, researchers claimed that while they were trying to publish their work about the footprints at high-profile publications they got \\"ferociously aggressive responses\\", criticism and rejection from reviewers and editors. According to the researchers ‚ÄúBasically, it wasn't a true peer review process at all,‚Äù ‚ÄúThey were just trying to shut us down.‚Äù After multiple rejections from other publications, the study was eventually published in the journal, \\"Proceedings of the Geologists' Association.\\" Shortly after the research about the footprints was published, some prints were chiselled out of the rock and stolen. According to Protothema.gr, the culprit was a high school teacher, who was later arrested by Crete authorities at Kasteli, Chania.Chung, Emily (February 23, 2018). \\"One Hell of an Impression\\".

He was instrumental in implementing and championing the British risk-based approach to workplace health, safety and welfare: through drafting the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and as the first Director-General of the Health and Safety Executive, the body responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act.  Biography  Locke was born in King‚Äôs Norton, Warwickshire, son of Percy John Howard Locke and Josephine Locke n√©e Marshfield. He was educated at Hymers College, Hull and Queen‚Äôs College, Oxford graduating in 1944 with a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Locke joined the civil service in 1945 as an Assistant Principal in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining there until 1965. He was promoted to Under-Secretary and worked in the Cabinet Office from 1965‚Äì66 and in the Ministry of Transport from 1966‚Äì68. His administrative abilities so impressed the Minister, Barbara Castle, that she took Locke with her when she was transferred to the Department of Employment and Productivity in 1968.John Locke Obituary, Times, 16 Oct 1998, p.29 In 1971 Locke was promoted to Deputy-Secretary and remained in the Department of Employment from 1971‚Äì74 under the Conservative Administration. He was secretary to Lord Wilberforce's court of inquiry into the electricity industry pay dispute in 1971.'Treasury chief to face electricity inquiry', Times, 9 Jan 1971, p. 5Coal Industry (Wilberforce Report) House of Commons Debate 21 February 1972 vol 831 cc898-906Lord Wilberforce obituary, Civilised and balanced judge, cautious but acceptant of change: The Guardian, 19 Feb 2003.Lord Wilberforce obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 18 Feb 2003. This was an unusually senior appointment for such a role and demonstrates the seriousness of the situation for the government. Negotiations between the industry and the unions had broken down in December 1970 and the unions had taken industrial action which led to major disruption of electricity supplies and the government had declared a state of emergency. The Wilberforce court of inquiry was held in the week of 18 January and its report was published on 10 February 1971. The report noted that the majority of workers in the industry had not, between 1964 and 1969, been adequately compensated for changes to working conditions. The report recommended pay increases of ¬£105 a year and an extra ¬£35 a year for craftsmen and foremen plus improved shift payments and three additional days' holiday. The recommendations were incorporated in an agreement on 22 March. Locke was largely responsible for drafting the Employment and Training Act 1973 which established the Manpower Services Commission; and personally would have wished to head the Commission although his career took another direction. He was also responsible for reorganising the Department of Employment, including the Employment Service, the Training Service and Unemployment Benefit Service.  Workplace health, safety and welfare  Locke's major achievements were implementing the recommendations of the 1972 Robens Report on occupational safety and health by transposing it into statute as the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974; and leading the Health and Safety Executive for nine years. The Robens Report had noted the humanitarian cost ‚Äì 1,000 fatalities and half a million injuries a year ‚Äì of the existing \\"bloated, fragmented, reactive and overly prescriptive system\\". This would be replaced with redistribution of responsibilities away from statutory regulation to \\"those who create the risks and those who work with them\\". Robens believed the role of the state was to facilitate good practice, establishing and strengthening the arrangements through which self-regulation could thrive. However, this entailed considerable change within the machinery of government. From 1972 to 1974 Locke was involved in a \\"prolonged and intensive period of interdepartmental consultation\\" on the new arrangements; as the Secretary of State for Employment, Michael Foot, said: \\"what that means is that there was a first- class Whitehall row\\", as Departments resisted the transfer of their health and safety functions to a new quasi-independent authority. Locke's \\"blend of creativity and steel\\" was deployed effectively to fuse together 13 organisations from six ministries.The National Archives, BA 17/855, HS(72) 30th meeting 'Follow up of Robens Report on Safety and Health at Work', 8 Dec 1972. He took over as Director of Occupational Safety and Health in the Department of Employment with the Chief Inspector of Factories and the Chief Employment Medical Adviser reporting to him. He also acted as Chairman of the shadow management board for the new Health and Safety Executive established by the 1974 Act. The Robens Report had envisaged the responsibility for health and safety would be vested in a single institution, the National Authority for Safety and Health at Work. However, Locke was instrumental in creating two new agencies instead of the single authority.The National Archives, BA 17/860, Department of Employment, 'Separation of the Commission and the Executive', 9 July 1973. For records of the Robens Committee see TNA LAB 96. The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) developed health and safety policy: it was a tripartite organisation incorporating the interests of employees, employers and the public; realised through trade unions, employers organisations, and local authorities and professional bodies. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was, legally, a three person body corporate, comprising a Director- General and two Deputy Directors-General, its operational arm comprised officials enforcing the law, undertaking research and publicity and providing advice to the HSC. Locke was the first Director-General of the Health and Safety Executive from its establishment on 1 January 1975 until December 1983. He actively promoted the regulatory model established by the Health and Safety at Work etc Act by publishing papers, giving lectures,J. Locke, 'The politics of health and safety' Alexander Redgrave Memorial Lecture, 1981. and contributing to contemporary debates on safety issues'MP attacks island oil plants expansion', The Guardian, 21 Jun 1978, p.2'Unions will be safety watchdogs', The Guardian,1 Oct 1978, p.2'Safety changes urged for Canvey Island plants', Times, 21 Jun 1978, p.2 and health concerns.'Safety executive director's plea to end rift over herbicide peril', The Guardian, 1 Jul 1980, p.2  Career appraisal and legacies  Locke retired from the civil service in December 1983. Michael Foot, then Leader of the Opposition, paid tribute to him in Parliament, saying: \\"John Locke was one of the great civil servants, and without his inspiration and drive we would not have been able to establish the [Health and Safety] Commission in that way. His work has been of outstanding importance to the Commission\\". His successor as Director-General, John Rimington, said that Locke was the first official to realise the importance of the professionalisation of occupational safety and health and \\"put his effort where his mouth was in helping, playing a leading part ... in the development of the framework for professional testing and examination\\". Locke did a \\"good deal to maintain and improve the professional status\\" of safety advisers in the face of scepticism by some in the business community that advisers were \\"interpreting rules too strictly and making unnecessary and expensive demands\\". Three years after retiring he accepted the unpaid chairmanship of the National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health until September 1993. He was a director of the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health until November 1993. He was also invited by the Australian Government to advise on setting up a safety executive. Locke was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the New Year honours list 1984.  Personal life  Locke married the architect Eirene Sylvia Sykes (21 September 1921 ‚Äì 5 August 2012) daughter of Francis Adam and Dorothy Sykes, in the Methodist church Hinde Street Marylebone, London, on 17 July 1948.Marriage certificate 1948 They had two daughters, Diana R.C. Locke and (Carol) Imogen H. Locke. His hobbies included hill-walking, gardening, and contemporary opera. His dress style ‚Äì Mao-style tunics, kaftans and mauve suits ‚Äì sometimes amused or disconcerted conservative civil servants and business leaders. In 1939 he was a scholar living with the Tinson family at Homes Burnby Lane Pocklington Yorkshire.Census 1939 His address in 1948 was 73 Philbeach Gardens, Earls Court London; then 4 Old Palace Terrace, Richmond, Surrey; and Box Trees, 8 Sea Road, East Preston, Sussex, BN16 1JP.

The annual military parade Mongolian Armed Forces on the southern part of S√ºkhbaatar Square is the main event during State Flag Day. The parade has been held since 2009, and is presided by the President of Mongolia in his/her capacity as Commander in Chief of the MAF.https://gogo.mn/r/3y2n3 The ceremonies begin as the president steps out of the Government Palace to be received at the saluting base by the Speaker of the State Great Khural, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, as well as members of the government and the General Staff of the Mongolian Armed Forces. As the President receives the salute, then a car carrying a color guard from the National Defense University takes its place in the parade to the tune of the Tugiin March. After a fanfare by the combined massed bands of the Ulaanbaatar garrison provided by the Military Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Mongolia and the Brass Band of the Military Music College of Mongolia of the NDU, the Minister of Defense arrives in the center of the square to receive the report from the Chief of the General Staff of the MAF, on the status of the parade and its readiness for inspection. As the Minister's vehicle pass the mobile column of the parade he/she greets the formations and congratulates them on the holiday. Once the minister and the parade commander finish their inspection, the minister's vehicle heads to the saluting base to greet the president and give his/her ceremonial report on the parade's readiness to march off. Following this, the National Anthem of Mongolia is played by the band as the national flag is raised. Following a threefold Urra by the armed forces, the parade commander orders the parade formations to stand at attention and to move their colours and commanders to the front of their formation for the march past. Once the commander orders the parade to march in quick time with the command Eyes on the right, quick march!, the Corps of Drums of the Military Music College, march to a tune being played by the drummers and fifers. By the signal of the Corps Drum Major, massed bands start playing and the corps stops and swings its drumsticks while their eyes are on the right. The Corps of Drums are then immediately followed by cadets from the NDU, who are then followed by the parade formations participating in the parade, ending with the Mongolian State Honor Guard Battalion.

It was the first inter-Korean summit since the Korean War 1950-1953. Regarding the first inter-Korean summit, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kim Dae-Jung for his work for democracy and human rights in North and South Korea in East Asia in general. Kim Dae Jung's Sunshine Policy for reconciliation with North Korea was recognized.  Overview  The first summit was held June 13‚Äì15, 2000, in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-il, the North Korean supreme leader, met with Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president at the time, who received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts as this summit occurred seemingly as a result of his Sunshine Policy, which South Korea maintained until President Lee Myung Bak adopted a more hardline position against North Korea.  Details  * It was the first Inter-Korean summit meeting after Korean war, and as a result of the talks, the June 15 joint declaration was announced on the last day. On December 25, 2000, the Associated Press of the United States Associated Press published the \\"Top 10 News in 2000\\", which ranked 5th was the South‚ÄìNorth Korea summit. The inter-Korean talks continued, and North Korea negotiated with normalization of relations with Japan and the United States while maintaining a reconciliation atmosphere. Kim Jong Il's early visit to Seoul was foreseen, but it was not realized due to the sudden change of international situation. In accordance with the North‚ÄìSouth Joint Declaration arising from the first Inter-Korean summit, the North-South ministerial and military working-level talks were held four times in Pyongyang, Seoul and Jeju Island from July to December 2000. These also involved North‚ÄìSouth Red Cross talks (three times) and several working-level contacts for North and South economic cooperation, continuing until March 2007. Kim Dae Jung, the South Korean president at the time, received the Nobel Peace Prize for successfully arranging the summit. * However, the South Korean Government paid North Korea approximately US$500 million to attend the Summit. This payment was kept secret at the time and only emerged three years later, causing a major political scandal called the Cash-for-summit scandal. It was later discovered that South Korea had secretly paid the North Korean Government $200 million to attend, and because of this issue 6 South Korean businessmen and officials were convicted. In August 2000, after over 50 years of separation, some members of separated families and relatives in the North and South had a reunification meeting with each other in Pyongyang and Seoul. Subsequent Inter-Korean summit talks were held and the June 15 North‚ÄìSouth Joint Declaration was adopted.  Peace declaration (eight-point agreement) # South and North Korea are to implement the June 15 Joint Declaration # South and North Korea are to work for mutual respect and trust in order to overcome differences in ideology, system. # South and North Korea are to ease military tensions, hold defense ministerial talks in November in Pyongyang to discuss ways of supporting inter-Korean economic cooperation and easing tension. # The two sides agree on the need to end the current armistice and establish permanent peace. # The two sides are to create a special peace zone around Haeju in North Korea and nearby areas. # South and North Korea are to develop cooperation in the history, language, education, technology, culture, sports, and social sectors. # South and North Korea are to actively push for humanitarian cooperation and expansion of the reunions of separated families. # South and North Korea are to strengthen cooperation for national interest in the international stage and the benefits of Korean residents abroad.

He set five poems by different authors, mostly contemporary poets, for a lower voice and piano. Simrock published the work in 1888.  History  Brahms recorded in a pocket diary entry written in Thun, Switzerland, in August 1886, that he had set several poems to music, including Klaus Groth's \\"Wie Melodien zieht es mir leise durch den Sinn\\" (\\"Like melodies it steals softly through my mind\\"), Hermann Lingg's \\"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer\\" (\\"My slumber grows more and more gentle\\"), Carl von Lemcke's Verrat / \\"Ich stand in einer lauen Nacht\\" (Betrayal / \\"I stood, it was one balmy night\\") and another song by Paul Flemming, all of them authors from the 19th century. He probably composed the songs with the voice of Hermine Spies in mind, who privately sang some of them for him. Two years later, Brahms offered a group of songs for lower voice to his publisher Simrock, to be his Op. 105, together with a group for high voice as Op. 106\\\\. The final grouping and order was achieved in a personal meeting of the composer and the publisher, ultimately adding to Op. 105 a setting of a traditional Lower Rhenish song, \\"Feins Liebchen, trau du nicht\\" (\\"Beloved, do not trust\\") and a poem by Detlev von Liliencron, Auf dem Kirchhofe / \\"Der Tag ging regenschwer und sturmbewegt\\" (At the graveyard / \\"The day was heavy with rain and storms\\"): # Wie Melodien zieht es mir leise durch den Sinn (Groth) # Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer (Lingg) # Feins Liebchen, trau du nicht (traditional) # Der Tag ging regenschwer (Liliencron) # Ich stand in einer lauen Nacht (Lemcke) The group, as others by Brahms, has been metaphorically described as a \\"song bouquet\\", likening it to flowers \\"plucked\\" from different sources and then combined into a whole. The songs were premiered individually, the first song on 11 February 1887 in Vienna, the second at a recital of Amalie Joachim in Berlin on 1 February 1888, the third on 6 March 1888 in Vienna, the fourth on 30 November 1888 there, and the fifth also there on 5 December 1888, in a concert of Olga Segel. Later performances and recordings also often ignored the published grouping, placing individual songs in different contexts. The melodies of some of these songs also make appearances in Brahms' instrumental works, especially \\"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer\\", which he had used a few years earlier as a cello solo theme in the third movement of his Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major. Motifs from three of the songs appear in his Violin Sonata No. 2, \\"Wie Melodien zieht es mir leise durch den Sinn\\" as the second subject of the first movement, and both \\"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer\\" and \\"Auf dem Kirchhofe\\" in the final movement.

Bryant is a British-Canadian geographer and Professor of Political Ecology at King's College London, retiring in September 2020. He is known for his contributions to the interdisciplinary field of political ecology. Education and career Bryant studied politics to receive a BA (Hons) from the University of Victoria, Canada, in 1983 and an MA from Carleton University, Canada, in 1989. He received a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 1993 for research on forestry in Burma. Bryant has been active in the Department of Geography at King's College London since 1993. He has also taught at Cambridge University, Yale University and University College London and has, among other places, been invited to speak at the universities in Oxford, Chicago and Copenhagen. He serves on the editorial boards of Political Geography, and the Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography. Scholarship Political ecology Bryant has played a key role in the development of political ecology as an interdisciplinary field, with implications in geography, anthropology, and development studies. With Sin√©ad Bailey, he published the landmark Third World Political Ecology (Routledge, 1997) arguing that the costs and benefits of environmental change always are distributed unequally. Environmental change also reinforces or alters social and economic inequalities as well as power relations. Bryant and Bailey developed an actor-centred perspective to show how environmental change is shaped by actors on different scales with unequal power resources. Bryant has continued to synthesize research in the field, most recently in the International Handbook of Political Ecology (Edward Elgar, 2015). Forestry A key theme in Bryant's research has been the politics of forestry, particularly in Burma. He has studied how the Burmese state historically has sought to control forests and forest-related activities, but also how other environmental actors including peasants, loggers, and transnational corporations have contested state control. As part of a wider effort to study ethical consumption, he has contributed to our understanding of the knowledge regimes and violence associated with teak branding for Western markets. NGOs and moral capital Another theme in Bryant's research has been the role of NGOs in environmental struggles and the way such organizations strategize and empower themselves by generating 'moral capital'. Through in-depth studies of NGOs in the Philippines, he argues that the 'quest for moral capital' is compromised by NGOs' need to work with political and economic elites. Personal life Bryant lives with his wife and two children in London. Books * Bryant, R. L. (ed.) 2015. The International Handbook of Political Ecology. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar. * Paniagua, A., R. L.

It is based on a measurement of air kerma and conversion factors. MGD can be calculated from measurements made with PMMA blocks. It is often used to compare typical doses to patients between different centres or internationally, and is the preferred measure of the potential risk from mammography. Calculation MGD can be calculated from a measured incident air kerma at the top of the breast, K, as follows: D=Kgcs g converts from incident air kerma to MGD, with a glandularity of 50%, based on breast thickness and HVL. c corrects for glandularity other than 50%, depending on the breast thickness and HVL, with two versions for ages 50‚Äì64 and 40-49. s corrects for the x-ray spectra in use with a table of target/filter combinations. Applications MGD is typically used to define limits on mammography exposures by national and international organisations such as the European Union and International Atomic Energy Agency, at <2.5 milligray (mGy) per exposure to a standard breast (4.5 cm PMMA). In routine quality assurance testing of mammographic equipment, MGD measurements for a range of effective breast thicknesses with PMMA, and from real patient exposures, is widely recommended.

Whitney Norton (January 1, 1840 - January 23, 1937) was a poet, author and Christian Scientist. Early life Delia E. Whitney was born in Fort Edward, New York, on January 1, 1840. She was educated mainly in Fort Edward Academy. Career Delia Whitney Norton started to write at an early age. Before her twelfth year she was a regular contributor, as Delia E. Whitney, to several Boston and New York papers and magazines. The Boston Cultivator published her first literary efforts. Afterward she contributed to The Galaxy, Scribner's Magazine, The Ladies' Repository, the Christian Union, the Advance, the Boston Repository and other journals. The International Sunday-School Association offered prizes for the best hymns on the lessons for the year. Norton wrote fifty-nine hymns in about ten days, which were accepted, and among eight-hundred competitors she won three first prizes. Madame Parepa Rosa, the Italian prima donna, sent her manager on a journey of five-hundred miles to request of Norton a song for concert purposes, when Norton wrote the humorous poem, \\"Do Not Slam the Gate\\" which was sung and published the world over. In spite of delicate health, she was always identified with every good work in church, society and humanitarian directions. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Woman Suffrage Association, Woman's Relief Corps, Woman's Industrial Exchange, hospital boards and private charities absorbed her time for many years to the almost entire exclusion of literary labor. After surgeons and physicians failed to help, her health was fixed by her faith on God as a healing power, and since then she gave her whole time to the work of healing others, and preaching the gospel of Christian Science, in private and public, as revealed to her in the Scripture, and demonstrated through the restoration of the blind and lame, the diseased and deformed, the conversion of infidels and the cure of the evil of intemperance and kindred habits. She was ordained for the public ministry. Personal life Delia Whitney Norton became an invalid when thirteen years of age, and for many years suffered excruciatingly. In January, 1874, she married Henry B. Norton (1842-1925), of Rochester, New York. She had one son, Frank Whitney Norton. She lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

It is located on Stationseiland island next to Amsterdam Central Station and has place for 2500 bicycles. The name is derived from fiets (bicycle) and flat, an originally English word which the Dutch use to denote multi-level apartment complexes.  History  Alderman of Traffic and Transport of the City of Amsterdam Frank K√∂hler opened the Fietsflat on 5 April 2001. The bike parking facility was designed to be only temporary, needed during construction works around the Central Station area. It was to be closed in 2004, it is however currently still in use. New proposals to close the structure in 2009 failed as well. The newest intention is to close it after two big new underground bicycle parking garages have been construction on the front and IJ side of the station. In summer of 2017 the structure underwent renovations.  Design  The Fietsflat was designed by VMX Architecten. The structure is 100 metres long, 14 metres wide and 3 storeys tall. Because the facility is so long and high, bicycling is permitted throughout. During the design process the designers had to keep a couple of strict preconditions in mind. The structure could not damage or otherwise penetrate the then newly renovated quay on which is resides. Also the canal boats had to be able to still make their turns in the Open Havenfront basin. To meet security needs the structure has been designed as transparently as possible.In Dutch: Architectuur Centrum Amsterdam: Fietsflat Centraal Station, citing: Marlies Buurman, Maarten Kloos (red.), Amsterdam Architecture 2000-2002, Amsterdam 2003, p.54-55 The floors are inclined, which helps to keep unwanted people out because it is not comfortable to stay in for a longer amount of time. To ensure safety there is security personnel on site 24/7. The design was nominated for the NAi Architectuurprijs award in 2001.In Dutch: NewScientist: Nominaties voor Nederlandse architectuurprijs bekend, 14-5-2002  Expansion  There were plans to build a second, identical, Fietsflat on the IJ side of Amsterdam Central Station due to open September 2006. In April of the same year, the City Council did not approve of the 4 million euro budget. They opted for more flexible, faster and cheaper solutions with temporary parking spots on several locations, including pontoons and ferries.In Dutch: Blik op Nieuws Noord Holland: G√©√©n tweede fietsflat bij CS In 2014 the City approved a large new underground bicycle parking facility underneath the Open Havenfront at Prins Hendrikkade, right opposite the Fietsflat. In 2017 the City approved a large new underground garage in the IJ at the backside of Centraal Station. The underwater bicycle parking station at Prins Hendrikkade will have 7.000 parking spots and in 2030 there will be 21.500 parking spots around Amsterdam Central Station.In Dutch: Gemeente Amsterdam, Bouw- en verkeersprojecten: De Entree: vernieuwing centrumzijde Amsterdam CentraalIn Dutch: Centrum voor Ondergronds Bouwen en ondergronds ruimtegebruik: De Verdieping, september 2016: Onderwaterfietsenstalling bij Amsterdam CS References Bicycle parking Buildings and structures in Amsterdam Transport in Amsterdam ","title":"Fietsflat"},{"id":"55205455","text":"Juan Pablo G√≥mez Vidal (born 11 May 1991), is an Argentine-born Chilean footballer that currently plays for Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n club Uni√≥n Espa√±ola.

Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. It was approved for medical use in Australia in July 2020. Cemiplimab is the first FDA approval of a medication specifically for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).  Medical uses  Cemiplimab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.  Adverse effects  Cemiplimab is associated with side effects related to the activity of the immune system, which can be serious, although most side effects go away with appropriate treatment or on stopping cemiplimab. The most common immune- related effects (which may affect up to 1 in 10 people) were hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland with tiredness, weight gain, and skin and hair changes), pneumonitis (inflammation in the lungs causing shortness of breath and cough), skin reactions, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland which can cause hyperactivity, sweating, weight loss and thirst) and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Severe reactions, including Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (life-threatening reactions with flu- like symptoms and painful rash affecting the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals) have been reported with cemiplimab. Cemiplimab can cause harm to a developing fetus; women should be advised of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. Mechanism of action Cemiplimab targets the cellular pathway known as PD-1 (protein found on the body‚Äôs immune cells and some cancer cells) so it acts as a checkpoint inhibitor.New PD-1 Inhibitor OK'd for Cutaneous SCC - Sixth PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor approved by agency 2018  History  The safety and efficacy of cemiplimab was studied in two open label clinical trials. A total of 108 participants (75 with metastatic disease and 33 with locally-advanced disease) were included in the efficacy evaluation. The study‚Äôs primary endpoint was objective response rate, or the percentage of participants who experienced partial shrinkage or complete disappearance of their tumor(s) after treatment. Results showed that 47.2 percent of all participants treated with cemiplimab had their tumors shrink or disappear. The majority of these participants had ongoing responses at the time of data analysis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application of cemiplimab breakthrough therapy and priority review designations. The FDA granted the approval of cemiplimab-rwlc to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Her novel Paradise (1990) was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction. Her subsequent self-translation of the work into Spanish, as El para√≠so (1990), was named by El Mercurio as the Chilean Book of the Year, was a best-seller for five months in Spain, and was nominated for the Miguel de Cervantes Prize. Her short stories Troopers (1986) and The White Bedspread (1991) each won a Phoebe Prize from George Mason University. Bedspread also was selected as the winner of the PEN International short story contest. Early life and education Elena Castedo Maga√±a was born in 1937 in Barcelona to Elvira Maga√±a Cuadrado and Leopoldo Castedo Hern√°ndez de Padilla, during an air raid in the Spanish Civil War. At the time of her birth, her parents were students. Later, her mother became a linguist and her father was an art historian. Forced to flee to France a year later upon the fall of the Spanish Republic, her parents quickly realized that the country was likely to fall to Nazi Germany. They left France with 2,200 other refugees in August 1939, aboard a rented cargo ship, the SS Winnipeg, a venture arranged by the Chilean Government through poet Pablo Neruda, with help from the Spanish Republic-in-exile, among others. After being refused entry to Panama, the boat arrived in Chile where they were allowed to land. Her family moved frequently during her youth and though she was given books to read she did not attend school until after the fourth grade. In 1958, after completing one year of secondary schooling, she toured the United States with a group of Chilean students and was featured in newspaper articles comparing her beauty to that of Ingrid Bergman, Audrey Hepburn, and Sophia Loren. That year in Reno, Nevada, Castedo married Dalton Wooding, with whom she would have two children. The family moved often, living in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Sacramento, until the couple separated in 1965. After Wooding's suicide that year, she moved to Connecticut to live near her sister. With very little income and lacking education, she worked as an appliance demonstrator, day-care attendant, door-to-door saleswoman, model, and Spanish tutor, before deciding to return to Chile to complete her education. She attended an accelerated program at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and in 1966 earned a teaching degree. Simultaneously with her studies, she was employed as a social worker and after her graduation taught at the English College and Nascimiento Institute of Santiago for a year. Able to earn a scholarship because of her high scholastic marks, Castedo enrolled at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating with a master's degree in Spanish-American literature in 1968. She was accepted as a teacher's assistant in the literature department at Harvard University and granted a scholarship to study for her PhD. While there, she met A. Denny Ellerman, a graduate student in the Economics Department, who would later become an economist at MIT. They married in Aix-en-Provence in 1973. The family moved to Vietnam, where Ellerman served as the Minister Counselor of Economic Affairs at the American Embassy. Castedo and her children were evacuated days before the Fall of Saigon and made their way to Hong Kong. While living in various Asian countries she continued to work on her doctoral thesis and earned her PhD from Harvard in 1976. Writing career Throughout 1977, Castedo lectured at American University and then became the editor-in-chief at the journal, Revista Interamericana de Bibliografia/Inter-American Review of Bibliography, published by the Organization of American States. Between 1980 and 1985 she worked as a cultural affairs consultant and began publishing poetry. In 1986, her short story \\"Troopers\\" received a Phoebe Prize for best fiction from George Mason University. In 1990 she published her first full length novel, simultaneously as Paradise in English and El para√≠so in Spanish. The semi-autobiographical work won critical acclaim and \\"became the first novel written in Spanish and another language to win major nominations or prizes in both languages, in different countries\\". In the United States, it was nominated for a National Book Award for Fiction, placing as a finalist. The Spanish version spent five months as a number one best-seller in Spain and was nominated for the Miguel de Cervantes Prize. It was also named Book of the Year by the leading Chilean newspaper El Mercurio. In 1991, Castedo's short story \\"The White Bedspread\\" won the PEN International short story contest and earned her a second Phoebe Award. Her articles, poems and short stories have appeared in various publications, including African American Review, Americas, Amthropo's, Hispamerica and Phoebe. In addition, she has been a visiting lecturer, writer, and instructor for literary workshops throughout the country.

The screenplay was written by Barry Trivers from a story by Thomas Ahearn and Walton Butterfield. The film was released on September 26, 1937. Plot George Hayes is a radio announcer in New York with a propensity for his smart- aleck behavior and quick temper. During a rehearsal for the \\"Crunchy Munchy Hour\\", he gets into a heated argument with the owner of Crunchy Munchies, Cyrus Wittles. The argument ends with Hayes belting Wittles, which also ends Hayes' employment at the radio station. He is lured to the rural community of Valley Falls, where he is promised the job of manager for a local radio station, WBAM. Upon his arrival, he sees a well run station on the main street of the town, and walks in, believing it to be where he will be managing. There he meets Jane Arledge, who is the program manager for WVOX, the actual station he has walked into. Realizing his mistake, Arledge agrees to take him to WBAM, which is actually not much of a station, housed in a barn, with a single employee, Tommy Astor. Hayes wants to make the station a success, in order to impress Jane. He calls his friend, Tiny Martin, in New York City to come and help him. While they are working to get the station together, Hayes overhears the mayor of the town conspiring with the owner of WVOX, Harry Fox, to rig the upcoming election. He broadcasts the details, which causes a scandal. Jane initially doesn‚Äôt believe the accusations about her boss, and her tiff with Hayes, along with some coaxing by Tiny, convince Hayes to return plan to return to New York City. As Hayes is leaving for the train station, Jane uncovers evidence about her boss‚Äôs plan to embezzle money from the town after the election, in collusion with the Mayor. Not being able to use WVOX‚Äôs equipment, she rushes over to WBAM to broadcast her findings. Hayes hears the broadcast at the rail station and fears for Jane‚Äôs safety, so he returns to town. The townspeople are incensed at the mayor and Fox, and run them out of town. Jane declares her love for Hayes, and the two depart for New York City, leaving Astor to run the town's only remaining radio station.

Dorian Atvos had completed a screenplay based on the original story by Thomas Ahearn and Walton Butterfield. Lou Brock was picked to produce the film for Universal, with Larry J. Blake in the leading role. John King was also expected to appear in the film. A week later it was announced that Lester Cole would be re-writing the screenplay. In late May, Variety reported that Universal was ready to begin production on the film. On June 26, Don Wilson, who was the announcer for The Jack Benny Program, was added to the cast in a primary role. Harrison's Reports, in their forecast for the 1937-38 films, were not kind to the upcoming film. Even though they thought highly of the producer, Brock, they felt that the story was so weak that the project should be abandoned. Calling the plot \\"inane\\", they considered it run of the mill, with nothing novel, and no human interest. William Gargan was selected as the male lead by the end of June, and it was revealed that Sidney Salkow would helm the picture. Universal announced on July 3 that the start of production on the project was imminent. Shortly after, it was announced that Irene Hervey had been signed to a contract by Universal, and that her first project would be the lead in this film. In early July it was revealed that Brock had cast Judith Barrett as the female romantic lead for the film. The picture began filming on July 6. Shortly after, on July 7, Sterling Holloway was added to the cast. That same week it was revealed that William Davidson and Gerald Oliver Smith had joined the cast. In mid-July, Deane Janis was flown in to record the film's theme song, \\"Behind the Mike\\". Around the same time it was revealed that Jimmy McHugh (music) and Harold Adamson (lyrics) were writing \\"Once You're In Love\\" for the picture, while Harold Adamson wrote \\"Crunchie Munchies\\". Roy Atwell, Spencer Charters, Grady Sutton, and Jerry Mandy were added to the cast in July, followed shortly by Harlan Briggs and Charles Brokaw. In early August, Universal announced that the film would be released on September 19, however by August 17 the release date had been pushed back to September 26. Universal, believing they were making up a fictitious station, used the call sign \\"WBAM\\". However, those call letters were actually a station belonging to WOR, and used on one of their broadcast relay transmitters. Reception The Film Daily gave the film a good review, enjoying the comic gags scattered throughout the production. They enjoyed the pacing and action, while they felt the storyline was a bit weak. They complimented the work of Gargan, Barrett, Wilson, and Holloway, as well as the directing of Salkow. Harrison's Reports was much less kind. They had not liked the premise of the film when they had reviewed it pre-production, and their review echoed those earlier sentiments. They felt the script was \\"trite\\", and the action \\"silly\\", although they did compliment the work of the actors. Their final grade was \\"fair to poor\\". Motion Picture Daily did not give the film a warm review, stating that it was more of the \\"quantity rather quality\\" mode, as well as also noting the weakness of the script.

Combo Breaker was the debut of the Injustice 2 Pro Series, a tournament which was won by SonicFox. Background Combo Breaker 2017 was the third annual Combo Breaker event since it was rebranded from Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament. ESPN called Combo Breaker the \\"third- largest fighting game event in the US,\\" only behind the Evolution Championship Series and Community Effort Orlando. Besides featuring a Premier Event for the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, Combo Breaker 2017 also featured the first tournament of Injustice 2. The convention was held in Mega Center in St. Charles, Illinois on the weekend of May 26 to May 28. Other games played at Combo Breaker 2017 included Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Tekken 7, Guilty Gear Xrd REV2, and Super Street Fighter II Turbo. In total, twenty different games were played at this event, and were broadcast across seven separate livestreams. Tournament summary Street Fighter V Combo Breaker 2017 coincided with two major invitational Street Fighter V tournaments in the United States: Eleague and Red Bull Kumite. Due to the scheduling overlap, former Evo-winner Keita \\"Fuudo\\" Ai and NorCal Regionals and DreamHack Austin-winner Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley was unable to attend Combo Breaker, competing in Eleague instead. The schedule was selected by lottery, and both Fuudo and Punk were chosen for the Friday night pools. The top 8 of the Street Fighter V tournament at Combo Breaker 2017 was dominated by United States players, with only one international player left on the final day of the event, the Japanese Naoto Sako. Though the newcomer Balrog-player Brian \\"Brian_F\\" Foster was highly successful, Combo Breaker also saw multiple older players thrive, such as Chris \\"Chris G\\" Gonzalez, Justin Wong, and Ryan \\"Filipinochamp\\" Ramirez. This tournament was won by Capcom Cup 2016-champion NuckleDu, defeating Snake Eyez in the grand finals. Snake Eyez came in from the winner's bracket after winning a set against NuckleDu's Guile by playing with Zangief. NuckleDu managed to reset the grand finals, however, and though Snake Eyez was ahead of NuckleDu 2-0 in the final game, NuckleDu was eventually able to take the game. Injustice 2 The first Injustice 2 Pro Series event was held at Combo Breaker 2017. This tournament was won by Dominic \\"SonicFox\\" McLean, primarily playing the characters Deadshot and Black Adam throughout the top 8. According to ESPN, he was a favorite for the tournament and managed to control the pace of every match in which he played. The grand final was played between SonicFox with Black Adam and Sayed \\"TekkenMaster\\" Hashem with Atrocitus. SonicFox had beaten TekkenMaster 3-0 earlier in the tournament, which had made him drop into the loser's bracket. In the finals, SonicFox took the first two games, though TekkenMaster took the third by chip damage. TekkenMaster managed to force a stage transition in their fourth game, but a missed attack created an opening SonicFox was able to exploit, resulting in a 4-1 win. Tekken 7 Ahead of its official console release, Namco Bandai supported a Tekken 7 tournament held at Combo Breaker 2016. During the top 24 matches of the tournament, player KoDee halted his match against Tanukana in order to check the screen resolution of their monitor, to everyone's surprise. Though it is unproven for Tekken 7, some professional fighting game players believe that perform better at a resolution of 720p rather than 1080p. Though KoDee still lost to Tanukana 3-1, he later tweeted that at least five other players had complained about lag. During the finals of this same pool, Tanukana and Mateo attack each other simultaneously and both of their characters are knocked out, resulting in a double KO. Though neither the Combo Breaker 2017 event rules or the Tekken 7 World Tour rules mention anything related to double KOs, the judge decided that the two would need to play another set, which Tanukana went on to win. The tournament was won by JDCR, defeating Saint in the grand finals.

The proposed site borders both the Moomba-Adelaide gas pipe and an electricity transmission line. The power station is proposed to use six gas turbines to produce up to of electricity. It is expected to be operated as a peaking plant rather than running full time. The primary source of fuel will be the gas pipeline, however the plant will also be able to operate on diesel fuel, and will have diesel storage on site. Stage 1 is expected to only be two or three of the turbines, generating 100 to 150 MW of electricity. The power station was originally expected to take 12 months to build, and be commissioned in January 2019. An extension of time request granted an additional 12 months in February 2019, but as of November 2019, the Alinta board had not yet decided to make the investment. Existing overhead lines History Alinta Energy had previously operated the coal-fired power stations in South Australia known as Northern Power Station and the older Playford A and Playford B Power Stations, all near Port Augusta. It closed the last of these power stations in 2016, and since then had not been involved in generating electricity in South Australia. Both Alinta and the state government were widely criticised for closing the coal power stations when the state experienced a major blackout during a storm in September 2016. Ten years earlier, in March 2007, Flinders Power (now owned by Alinta Energy, and was the operating subsidiary for the Port Augusta power stations) had proposed to spend to build a 450MW gas-fired power station at Redbanks only one kilometre further north than the Reeves Plains proposal. However the Redbanks power station was never built. The development application for Reeves Plains was submitted on 12 October 2017 and opened for public comment on 8 November the same year. It received approval from John Rau, the Minister for Planning on 16 February 2018, the last day the government could make major decisions before the state election. Alinta had not yet completed its internal investment case and received approval from its board to proceed to construction. In September 2018, Alinta chief executive Jeff Dimery said that it had failed to get enough support from customers to reduce the investment risk of building the power station. The project was one of 12 projects shortlisted in March 2019 from 66 registrations of interest in the Australian Government's Underwriting New Generation Investments program.

It covers different aspects such as identity development including the 'coming out' process, parenting and family practices and supports for LGBTQ+ individuals, as well as issues of prejudice and discrimination involving the LGBTQ+ community.Balsam, K.

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.360x360px  Definition  LGBTQ+ psychology stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer psychology. This list is not inclusive to all people within the community and the plus represents other identities not covered within the acronym. In the past this field was known as Lesbian and Gay psychology.Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (Eds.). (2007). Out in psychology: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer perspectives. Chichester, UK: Wiley. Now it also includes Bisexual and Transgender identities and behaviours. In addition, the \\"Q\\" stands for Queer which includes sexual identities and behaviours that go beyond traditional sex and gender labels, roles, and expectations.Peel, E. (2014). LGBTQ+ psychology. In T. Thomas (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Critical Psychology. doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-5583-7_171 It is important to note that the word \\"queer\\" was historically a slur used towards people within the community. Those who identify as queer today have reclaimed this label as self- identification. However, due to the traditional use of the word, many people in the LGBTQ+ community continue to reject this label. The names for this field are different in different parts of the world. In the UK and USA, the acronym LGBTQ+ is widely used. The terms 'lesbian', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'trans' and 'queer' are not used all around the world and definitions vary. Apart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define sexuality and gender identity. These words and phrases typically come from western cultures. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones. It is concerned with the study of LGBTQ+ individuals' sexuality ‚Äì sexual identities and behaviours ‚Äì thereby validating their unique identities and experiences. This research focus is affirmative for LGBTQ+ individuals, as it challenges prejudiced beliefs, attitudes, and discriminatory policies and practices towards the LGBTQ+ community.Herek, G. M. (2004). Beyond \\"homophobia\\": Thinking about sexual stigma and prejudice in the twenty-first century. Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 1(2), 6‚Äì24.Herek, G. M. (2009). Hate crimes and stigma-related experiences among sexual minority adults in the United States: Prevalence estimates from a national probability sample. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 24, 54‚Äì74. It also includes the study of heterosexuality ‚Äì other-sex romantic attraction, preferences and behaviours, as well as heteronormativity ‚Äì the traditional view of heterosexuality being the universal norm.Meyer, D. (2017). The disregarding of heteronormativity: Emphasizing a happy queer adulthood and localizing anti-queer violence to adolescent schools. Sexual Resilience and Social Policy, 14(3), 331‚Äì344. doi:10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 This line of research aims to understand heterosexuality from a psychological perspective, with the additional goal of challenging heterosexuality as the norm in the field of psychology and in society as a whole. The overall goal of LGBTQ+ psychology is to raise awareness of LGBTQ+ issues in scholarly work and psychological research. In raising this awareness, LGBTQ+ psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice. In line with LGBTQ+ psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in LGBTQ+ research.  History  Alfred Kinsey.  Sexology  Sexology is a part of the historical foundation upon which LGBTQ+ psychology was built. The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of sexology as a scientific field of sexuality and gender ambiguity, is highly relevant and seminal to the field of LGBTQ+ psychology. As previously mentioned, sexology is a scientific field of study focusing on sexuality and gender identity. In the field of sexology, a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define homosexuality. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both 'same-sex sexuality' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize sexuality and gender diversity separately. In terms of LGB sexualities, this would fall under sexual diversity. As for transsexuality, this would be placed under gender diversity. Important figures in this field include Magnus Hirschfeld and Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs.  The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology  Gay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of homosexuality as a mental illness and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of homosexual individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of homosexuality being associated with mental illness.Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13(4), 445‚Äì458. Following this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on heterosexual and cis-gender (i.e. non-trans) individuals' lived experiences. By involving LGBTQ+ individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, LGBTQ+ psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences. In the 1980s, the name gay affirmative psychology changed to Lesbian and Gay psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of gay men and lesbian women.Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ+ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives. Chichester, UK: Wiley. Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ+ or LGBTQIA+ are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ+ psychology. Due to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of LGBTQ+ psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in human sexuality and gender orientation. Further, the various letters within the LGBTQ+ acronym indicates the diversity and variation in the scope of research that is conducted within the field ‚Äì namely the types of research questions and the types of methodological approaches used to address these questions. Traditionally, LGBTQ+ psychology has largely focused on researching the experiences of gay men and lesbian women meeting the following criteria:Riggs, D. W. (2007). Recognizing race in LGBTQ+ psychology: Power, privilege and complicity. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives. Chichester, UK: Wiley. # Young # Caucasian # Middle-class # Healthy # Residing in urban areas The scope of research within the field of LGBTQ+ psychology has been somewhat lacking in breadth and diversity, neglecting the experiences of those who do not fit the stated criteria but rightly belong to the LGBTQ+ community. Overall, LGBTQ+ psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology that incorporates multiple perspectives and approaches regarding the populations of study, topics of research, as well as the theories and methodologies that inform the ways in which this research is carried out.  The historical emergence of critical psychology  The emergence of the field of critical psychology has led to the establishment of LGBTQ+ divisions within several key professional psychological associations. Firstly, within the American Psychological Association (APA), Division 44 is known as the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues. Secondly, within the Australian Psychological Society, there is a Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Interest Group. Thirdly, within the British Psychological Society, there is a Psychology of Sexualities Section. Lastly, within the Canadian Psychological Association, there is a Section on Sexual Orientation. All the above divisions specializing in LGBTQ+ psychology research and research-related issues demonstrate the increasing recognition and status of LGBTQ+ psychology in major psychological organizations covering the English speaking world.  Mental health  LGBTQ+ individuals experience a significant amount of stigma and discrimination at various stages of their lives. Often this stigmatization and discrimination persists throughout their lifetime. Specific acts of stigmatization and discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals include physical and sexual harassment. Hate crimes are also included.Bohan, J. (1996). Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms. New York: Routledge. These negative experiences put LGBTQ+ individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk. As a result of these experiences, LGBTQ+ individuals typically experience a higher frequency of mental health issues compared to those who do not belong to the LGBTQ+ population.Amadio, D. M., & Chung, Y. B. (2004). Internalized homophobia and substance use among lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons. Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services: Issues in Practice, Policy and Research, 17(1), 83‚Äì101. The following list shows the different mental health issues that LGBTQ+ individuals may experience: * Anxiety * Depression * Obsessive-compulsive disorder * Phobic disorder * Trauma * Substance abuse *Self-harming behaviors * Suicidal tendencies and suicide The list above is by no means complete or exhaustive, rather it shows the range and severity of the issues that LGBTQ+ individuals often experience. These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their LGBTQ+ identity in an anti-LGBTQ+ society.Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter? American Psychologist, 56(11), 931‚Äì947. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.56.11.931 thumb Suicidal tendencies and suicide are serious issues for LGBTQ+ youth. Compared to their non-LGBTQ+ peers, LGBTQ+ youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of attempted suicides. In school, LGBTQ+ youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing verbal and physical abuse due to their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. LGBTQ+ youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which LGBTQ+ youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among LGBTQ+ communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals.Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \\"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\\". Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. 32 (4): 509‚Äì522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3 Nevertheless, LGBTQ+ individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of prejudice or discrimination, nor do they respond in the same ways to prejudice or discrimination. What is common are the reasons leading to prejudice and discrimination. In the context of LGBTQ+-targeted prejudice and discrimination, it broadly relates to sexual orientation issues (e.g. LGB) or gender identity issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic prejudice and discrimination leads to LGBTQ individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences LGBTQ+ individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes LGBTQ+ individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674‚Äì697. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674 The 'coming out' process involving LGBTQ+ individuals can also create a lot of added pressure from family, peers and society. This process is about LGBTQ+ individuals openly proclaiming their sexual orientation and/or gender identity to others. In addition, LGBTQ+ individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example: Sexual orientation and/or gender transition Internalized oppression of sexual orientation and/or gender identity * Exclusion and ostracization * Removed or reduced family or social support * Facilitating mental health well- being for LGBTQ+ individuals is a highly pertinent matter. The main factors in promoting positive mental health for LGBTQ+ individuals are as follows:Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives. Chichester, UK: Wiley. * Presence of family and peer support * Community-based and workplace support * Understanding, appropriate and positive feedback provided during the coming out process * Defining, assessing and handling the social factors influencing LGBTQ+ individuals' health outcomes  LGBTQ+ identity development in youth  There is an increasing trend of LGBTQ+ youth coming out and openly embracing and establishing their sexual or gender identities to people around them. Since 2000 the average age of coming out was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that LGBTQ+ youth are comfortably recognizing their sexual or gender identities at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular sexuality and gender identity, it appears that young people have an awareness of their LGBTQ+ identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in childhood, specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and having non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests. During adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of adolescence, young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against gender and sexuality norms. In the middle of adolescence, young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards LGBTQ+ individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for LGBTQ+ youth who have come out to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of bullying, and more.Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge. While there appears to be more and more LGBTQ+ youth coming out about their sexual and gender identities, there are also youth who do not come out and are against the idea of coming out. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding LGBTQ+ identity development suggests that individuals who do not come out, or are against the idea of coming out are either in denial about their identity or wish to come out but are unable to. Aside from the fact that LGBTQ+ youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of coming out, there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and gender identities could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their sexuality and gender identitySavin-Williams, R. C. (2005). The new gay teenager. Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of social identity labels, demonstrating the importance of their sexuality and gender identity within their personal identity.Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36(1), 47‚Äì59. As well, LGBTQ+ individuals from ethnic and cultural minority groups often refrain from using sexual identity labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and Toni A. H. McNaron (Eds.), The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century (pp.91‚Äì97). New York: The Feminist Press.  Schools  Current data regarding LGBTQ+ families and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBTQ+-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), LGBT-Parent Families. New York, NY: Springer Children of LGBTQ+ parents are at risk of being the targets of discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals in the education system.Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. Social Science Research, 41, 771‚Äì774. Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the physical and psychological well- being of children from LGBTQ+ families. Apart from children of LGBTQ+ families having negative school experiences, LGBTQ+ parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ+ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the school climate. Gay-Straight Alliance LGBTQ+ parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement, and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals, as anti-LGBTQ+ language is often used and cases of harassment and victimization with regards to sexual orientation or gender identity often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows LGBTQ+ parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN School-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from LGBTQ+ families. Typically, these interventions target school climate, in particular the aspects which pertain to homophobia and transphobia. Enforcing anti-bullying/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from LGBTQ+ families from being victims of bullying and harassment. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from LGBTQ+ families will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive school climate in general. Using an LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum where LGBTQ+ individuals, history and events are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ+-related issues. Specific ways in which LGBTQ+ matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. same-sex couples and LGBTQ+ parents), discussing LGBTQ+ history (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the LGBTQ+ community), using LGBTQ+-inclusive texts in class and celebrating LGBTQ+ events (e.g. LGBTQ+ History Month in October or LGBTQ+ Pride Month in June). In addition, organizing LGBTQ student clubs (e.g. Gay- Straight Alliances) are a positive resource and source of support for students from LGBTQ+ families.Hutton, S. L. (2015).

Types of applications outside the theoretical perspective   Effective treatment methods  = Expressive writing = thumb When youth engaged in expressive writing on issues related to their LGBTQ+ identity, their mental health well-being improved. This improvement was especially significant in youth who did not have much social support, or who wrote about more serious topics.Crowley, J. P. (2013).

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 83, 875‚Äì889. = Parent and family-based LGBTQ+ treatment and education = Family-based treatment catering to suicidal LGBT adolescents where parents were given significant periods of time to process their feelings about and towards their child was found to be effective. For example, parents had time to think through how they felt about their child's LGBTQ+ orientation, and be made aware of how their responses towards their child could potentially reflect attitudes of devaluation. Adolescents that took part in this treatment had fewer suicidal thoughts and fewer depression-related thoughts and feelings. What is especially noteworthy is that these positive gains were sustained for many youth.Jacobs, J., & Freundlich, M. (2006). Achieving permanency for LGBTQ+ youth.

Conversion therapy consists of a variety of approaches ranging from aversion and hormonal therapy, to religious-based techniques such as threats of eternal damnation or use of prayer. Little empirical evidence exists for CT, as most evidence is anecdotal or lacks acknowledgement of participants potentially faking or experiencing dissonance-induced rationalization. Long-term effects of CT, such as decreased overall sex drive, shame, fear, low self-esteem, and increased depression and anxiety have been observed in individuals that participated in CT programs.

I'm not that good; I'm not really a singer [...] I wanted to shock people; I wanted to step outside of the YouTube world and do something that I actually thought was a piece of art\\". The \\"emotive\\" lyrics of \\"Out Loud\\" discuss themes of loss, loneliness and heartbreak, and were inspired by Hanna's poems in her book Adultolescence (2017). \\"Out Loud\\" was initially only meant to be released as a one-off promotion for the book. Musically, the ballad features a \\"sultry, dark melody that builds up to a tidal wave of a chorus\\". Reception Upon its release, \\"Out Loud\\" was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Chris DeVille of Stereogum criticized the song, stating that it \\"plays more like an SNL Digital Short than a legitimate tearjerker\\". He further likened it to Paris Hilton's \\"Stars Are Blind\\" (2006). Tatiana Cirisano of Billboard called it \\"no joke\\", and wrote \\"if listeners find it hard to reconcile the track's theme of loneliness with Hanna's 1.3 million Twitter followers, well, that's kind of the point\\".

The official music video begins with Hanna in front of a wall full of pictures, picking out multiple ones in which she is seen with her love interest; as she looks at them, the video cuts to footage of them together. Hanna subsequently tears all the photographs apart and falls to the floor crying, as the visual cuts to further memories of them. The second part of the clip features a \\"major plot twist\\", in which the singer attends her boyfriend's funeral, wearing a black dress and holding flowers in her hands.

When they reach near the Indo-Nepali border Dari realises that he forgot the dui rupaiyaa note at Maya's hotel. Without the note the Indian party refuse to give the gold package and give both of them a day to find and bring the note to them. The next day Dari visits Maya where he came to know that the ASP has taken his phone and Maya doesn't want him in her life anymore. In order to get his phone back Dari and Jureli follow the ASI into a fun fair, where they both along with the ASP dance and flirt with the main dancer (Swastima Khadka). On coming out of the fair the ASP opens the phone and finds out that Dari is Maya's lover, due to which a fight ensues between the two. Even this time Jureli manages to saved Dari. Later that night Maya reveals that she was in a relationship with Dari, but was forced to marry the ASP for the sake of her father. Dari and Jureli search for the note in the market but to no avail. So they decide to take help from Ghimire Thai (Rajan Ishan), a local goon of the region who trades peoples body parts illegally. However, they couldn't find the note, so Ghimire decides to trade their body parts. he forces both of them to eat sweets which have an intoxicating drug added to them. On the other hand, the ASP has made a sketch of Dari and threatens Maya that he won't spare Dari. Now, both Dari and Jureli are taken by Mandal, Ambulance wala (Rabindra Jha), whose Ambulance Jureli and Dari use for the smuggling so no one would suspect them and who also helps Ghimire trade the organs through his ambulance. After been saved by Mandal, the duo reveal the whole story to Mandal, who then is revealed to have cooperated with Ghimire. On Ghimire's command they call the Indian party only for it to be revealed that they want to kill the duo and take the whole gold package for themselves. Since they lost the dui rupiyaa their lives are saved. A hilarious fight ensues between Ghimire's gang, the Indian party, Dari and Jureli and their boss. The duo manage to escape in Mandal's ambulance and the rest are arrested by the ASP. After dropping Mandal to hospital (who got shot in his bum), Dari found two pieces of gold in the ambulance seat, which Jureli had thrown in anger before the flight. The ASP, on the other hand praises himself and his team for catching the criminals (i.e. Jureli and Dari's boss's gang and Ghimire's gang) and giving all the credit to Maya.

Her prominence came from her remarkable experience, being confined and unlawfully imprisoned in the Utica Lunatic Asylum for 26 months (October 1880 ‚Äì December 1882), through a plot of a secret enemy to kill her. She eventually managed to communicate with James Bailey Silkman, a lawyer who, like herself, was confined in the same asylum under similar circumstances. He succeeded in obtaining a writ of habeas corpus, and Judge George G. Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop sane and unlawfully incarcerated. After that time, she devoted her life to ameliorating the laws relating to lunacy. Lathrop felt she owed it to women to take her case before the New York State Legislature, and demand reform in this direction, but she was unsuccessful in two efforts and found herself penniless and facing the need to support herself. After several efforts, she became a court stenographer, and ten years after her release, wrote a book, the story of her own institutionalization, entitled A Secret Institution. Published at her own expense, this book led to the formation of the Lunacy Law Reform League, in 1889, a national organization with headquarters in New York City, of which Lathrop became the secretary and was the national organizer. Early years and education Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop was born in Rochester, New York. She was a daughter of Gen. William E. Lathrop, a Brigadier General of the National Guard. Lathrop's father had met and married Lathrop's mother, Jemima, at the age of 42 ‚Äì Jemima was 19. Lathrop had been one of five children, but had lost her eldest brother to disease in 1865 and her second eldest brother moved to the southern part of the country to look for work. Lathrop's father passed away in 1877 leaving his wife, and his three daughters to open their home to board strangers for income. She graduated from the Rochester Academy. Lathrop also often traveled significant distances and visited friends around Rochester. Career Teacher Lathrop became a teacher, which, owing to her father's failure in business, became a means of support to her family as well as to herself. She continued to teach successfully until her unlawful imprisonment in the Utica State Hospital (formerly known as the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica). Utica Lunatic Asylum incarceration and release Lathrop feared that Miss Hamlo, a boarder in her mother's house, was poisoning her. Lathrop was obsessed with a Mr. Zell, a former lover who married another woman after Lathrop rejected him. After repenting her decision to reject Zell, Lathrop became convinced that Hamlo was in alliance with Zell's wife. After Lathrop began seeing Zell everywhere, she believed he had divorced, and would now marry her if Lathrop survived Hamlo's poisonings. When Lathrop's life was saved on two occasions by friends, she took some of the aconite-poisoned tea to a chemist for analysis, as she sought reliable proof before making open charges against any one. At the instigation of a doctor who was in sympathy with the plot to incarcerate Lathrop, she went to Utica to consult Dr. John P. Gray, Superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in Utica, New York. Instead of seeing Grey, upon her arrival, she was incarcerated with the insane, without the commitment papers required by law, and kept a prisoner at the asylum for 26 months. She was sent to the asylum at the insistence of her mother and sisters, who lived in Rochester, and who asserted that Lathrop was suffering from the delusion that somebody was trying to poison her. Her answer was that it was not a delusion, that somebody was endeavoring to poison her. But she was willing to accept proof to the contrary, which was also evidence that there was no delusion. Nonetheless, her incarceration ensued. By the time Lathrop was admitted to the asylum, she was 32 years old and unmarried despite engagements to two different men. Her first engagement was broken off by her fianc√© due to cold feet and her second betrothed died from consumption. The hospital, according to Lathrop was ‚Äúa living tomb.‚Äù Within a few weeks of her arrival at Utica, Lathrop had written letters to two of her physician friends only to find out later that her letters had never been mailed. The attending physician claimed they were not sent because the asylum was not obliged to send her letters ‚Äúall over the country.‚Äù Lathrop was ‚Äúamazed and dumbfounded‚Äù at the idea that not only would her letters be read by the asylum doctors, but that they would never reach their intended destination. Lathrop had easily made a friend who had revealed to her how she would be able to communicate to the outside world without getting caught by the authorities. She obtained paper through another patient who had hidden the contraband in her room. The woman would not out rightly give the paper to Lathrop for fear of punishment for aiding and abetting, but hinted that there was nothing she could do if Lathrop took a page or two while she was elsewhere. Lathrop also wrote on newspaper edges and scraps of wrapping paper which she also hid in her skirt. Eventually, she managed to communicate with Silkman, a New York lawyer, who had been forcibly carried off and imprisoned in the same insane asylum. He obtained a writ of habeas corpus at once on behalf of Lathrop, and in December, 1882, Judge Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop to be sane and unlawfully incarcerated. Social reformer and autobiographer Immediately upon her release, Lathrop went before the New York State Legislature. She described her experience and the necessity for reform. After making another fruitless effort the succeeding year, she found herself homeless and penniless, and dependent upon a cousin's generosity for shelter and support, forced to begin her new life under the most difficult circumstances.A Secret Institution (1890) Lathrop collected money for a charitable society on a commission, spending her evenings studying stenography and typewriting. She soon started a business of her own and was successful as a court stenographer. Ten years after her release, she wrote her book, A Secret Institution, which was a history of her own life, written in the style of a novel, and descriptive of what she experienced or witnessed while an inmate of the Utica asylum. Keeping true to her vow ‚Äúto devote the rest of [her] life to the cause of the insane,‚Äù Lathrop formed the Lunacy Law Reform and the Anti-Kidnapping Leagues. The Leagues provided legal services to asylum patients who felt they were victims of a corrupt legal system. The goal of the leagues was to ‚Äúprotect sane people from false imprisonment.‚Äù Both groups had helped several individuals who had been unjustly incarcerated secure their freedom. The Lunacy Law Reform League in 1889, was a national organization having its headquarters in New York City, of which she was secretary and national organizer. Lathrop spoke out against asylum abuses, and became a spokesperson for others incarcerated as insane. She lived with self-doubt, fear, and suspicion, while trying to understand how incarceration affected her. She struggled with society's perceptions of her mental stability. Lathrop died in Saratoga, New York, on September 11, 1892, and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester. Legal case Albert Bach, legal counsel to Lathrop, held that the interesting point in the case was the question of the deprivation of Lathrop's postal rights while in the asylum. She was not permitted to have writing materials, and even though she succeeded in obtaining them, the asylum authorities disposed of her letters as they pleased. The claim was asserted that asylum managers have no such control over inmates as have prison managers; that the former institutions have more of the character of hospitals. Bach found nothing in the by-laws of the Utica asylum giving the right to this close supervision. He said that there were many instances of wrongful incarceration, and that justice would seem to dictate that inmates of asylums should have access to the mails. Even though much of it would be trash, it would be well worth while to endure that if information could be obtained to the release of a person improperly detained. Reports suggested that Lathrop would bring a suit of U$25,000 damages against the management of the Utica State Insane Asylum. The grounds alleged were the wrongful detention of herself, and the seizure of her letters written to friends asking them to help her to regain her liberty. Lathrop's lawyer gave the following statement of the scope of the lawsuit: > Of course the main point is in regard to the interception of letters that > she wrote to friends asking for assistance. If the managers of the asylums > have the right to intercept letters, they have the power to shut a person > entirely from the world, whether the person be insane or not. This is a > difference between a criminal and a lunatic. In the case of a criminal he is > in his position through his own fault, but the insane person is a patient, > and deserves all possible consideration. If they stop a person‚Äôs letters, > they virtually remove from that person the possibility of obtaining release. > The suit is brought not so much for the sake of damages, as to test the > point whether or not the managers of asylums have a right to enforce such a > rule. I have become interested in the matter, and intend to follow it up and > test the question thoroughly. One of the things I will do will be to write > to the Postmaster General, asking if it would not be advisable in case we > can prove that the authorities are wrong in prohibiting the forwarding of > letters, to place free delivery boxes in all asylums, that the patients may > have a chance to correspond without difficulty with their friends. I believe > such a system would do away with much of the abuse that without doubt exists > in many asylums, and would greatly lessen the chance of sane persons being > held in confinement.

Its campus is located in Surabaya, East Java and trains men and women to become officers of the Navy, including the Indonesian Marine Corps, Fleet Forces, Naval Aviation and support branches.  History  The Naval Academy opened its doors on 10 October 1951 as the Naval Institute of Surabaya (Institut Angkatan Laut ), its creation sanctioned by Ministerial Decree D/MP/279/1951 dated 29 June 1951 and Ministerial Decree D/MP/313/51 dated 28 July 1951 of the Ministry of Defense.History of the Naval Academy Major R. S. Hadiwinarso was its first superintendent. President Sukarno, provincial and city leaders were present during its inauguration in a location that was recently acquired by the national government. The Academy's first battalion of naval cadets were made up of officer cadets of the sea services and support branches, and by 1952 had opened its doors to cadets of the electronics branches and the Marine Corps. By 1954, the Navy set a 3 years course period for its naval cadets and by 1961 had adopted its present 4-year curiculum of study of its cadets. It acquired its present name (Akademy Angkatan Laut) in 1956 (the name was restored in 1984). Recent developments Starting in 2011, graduates of the academy were awarded a bachelor's degree (in applied defence sciences, Indonesian: Sarjana Sains Terapan Pertahanan) along with other academies in AKABRI. In 2017, the academy had its first female graduates in history.  Current curiculum  An Indonesian Naval Academy recruiting poster The Naval Academy, similar to most naval academies in the world, is a medium-sized, highly residential baccalaureate college, with a full-time, four-year undergraduate program that emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with no graduate program, preparing men and women to take on the challenge of being officers of the Indonesian Navy. The academy is accredited by the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education. Cadets who passed the initial selection process will first attend a 1-year basic program in Indonesian Military Academy with students from the Military, Air Force, and Police academies in Magelang, prior to 3 more years of specialized study in the Surabaya campus before being commissioned as officers of the Navy.  Undergraduate program - academic  The academic program consists of a structured core of subjects depending on the cadet's chosen specialty as a future Navy officer, balanced between the arts and sciences, in his/her chosen speciality branch. Regardless of major, all cadets graduate with a Bachelor of Applied Defense Science degree.  Undergraduate program ‚Äì military  As all cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants upon graduation, naval and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline fall under the purview of the Office of the Commandant of Cadets. Entering freshmen, or 4th class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day (in September) to start their military service training as future officers and are recognized as full cadets in a ceremony in January the following year alongside cadets from the other service branches and the National Police, where they receive ceremonial daggers. Additionally the cadets of the academy, which form the student body known as the Regiment of Naval Cadets, have additional open water and pool training to emphasize their readiness for ocean and water survival upon their completion of studies and commissioning as officers, plus sail training on the soon to be decommissioned barquentine KRI Dewaruci (to be replaced by the barque KRI Bimasuci) and the schooner KRI Arung Samudera, which also doubles as goodwill trips to many parts of the world. Additional training is provided by the training frigate KRI Ki Hajar Dewantara, the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia, for officer cadets of the fleet forces, technical and electronics branches, while Marine Corps cadets also receive additional training in the Marine Corps Training Command and with the 2nd Marine Force units in their chosen speciality (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and combat support). Selected cadets are also selected for foreign exchange studies in the military and naval academies of Singapore, Thailand, Australia, the Philippines, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, and even in the Royal Netherlands Navy Institute, among others.  Cadet life  Naval Cadets are classified not as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, but as fourth class, third class, second class, and first class, respectively, as a whole they are referred as Kadet AAL or Taruna AAL (Cadets of the Naval Academy). The Regiment of Naval Cadets is made up of four battalions, each composed of 3-5 companies of cadets from the 3rd to 1st classes onward (due to the joint service training done by the 4th class cadets), and all are led by Cadet Staff Sergeant Majors. Naval Cadets wear service dress uniforms similar to those of the other military academies within the INAF, with chevrons varying by school year or officer cadet rank. All wear gold anchor insignia on both lapel collars and scarlet shoulder boards of the service dress blue jacket. Those who are part of the Drum and Bugle Corps wear identical uniforms, but the bass and tenor drummers and baritone buglers wear combat dress uniforms.

The 4-6-0 B class was part of the development of modern superheated locomotives that had begun with the A class in 1906. Intended for fast freight trains and heavy stopping passenger trains, they proved to be highly useful in all types of traffic, and remained in use until the end of steam operations in Sweden. Eleven B class locomotives were sold to private railways during the 1930s, but all but one returned to SJ after the railway companies had been nationalized in the 1940s. One of the private operators, Stockholm-V√§ster√•s-Bergslagens J√§rnv√§g, had three more locomotives of the same type built, the last one in 1944. Most B class locomotives were eventually rebuilt with fully enclosed cabs, and some were equipped for oil-firing after the Second World War. When the locomotives became unnecessary in the daily traffic they were placed in the strategic reserve. Some locomotives from the reserve were reactivated during the winter of 1965-1966 due to a temporary shortage of electric locomotives. Most survived into the 1990s, and several have been preserved by the Swedish Railway Museum and preservation societies in Sweden, while sales to heritage railways abroad failed to reach the expected numbers.  Design  The B class mixed-traffic locomotives were part of the development of modern superheated locomotives that had begun with the A class in 1906 and the E class in 1907. The B class had bar frames, like the A class, and the leading bogie was based on that of the A class. Intended for fast freight trains and heavy passenger trains, the locomotives had six driving wheels and large outside cylinders, giving a 50% larger starting tractive effort than for the A class. They were capable of doing on flat ground and on long 1 in 100 gradients. The B class shared some characteristics with another 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotive, the Prussian P 8 class, and several sources state that they were based on the P 8, but another author describes them as \\"Swedish throughout\\". A new type of boiler was designed for the B class; it was also used for the Gb class, and became known as the BGb type. Some other kinds of locomotives were later rebuilt with this type of boiler, creating the A2, Ga2, Ga4 and Mc classes. The boiler was given a high position.  History  96 locomotives were built for SJ by Motala Verkstad, NOHAB and Vagn och Maskinfabriken Falun between 1909 and 1919; three more were built later for a private railway company. A very successful design, the B class turned out to be highly useful for all types of traffic. They were frequently used in heavy express trains, in addition to the intended passenger and freight train services. Nevertheless, mainline electrification meant that the need for steam locomotives declined in the 1930s, making it possible to sell some B class locomotives to private railways, while some others were placed in reserve. This changed with rising international tensions: the B class locomotives were deemed to be \\"valuable in wartime conditions\\", and as such included in a 1938 refurbishment program. The locomotives that had been in reserve were quickly returned to service. At least four locomotives were leased to the Norwegian State Railways during the German occupation of Norway. Some modifications were made on the B class locomotives. Most were eventually given fully enclosed cabs, but a few were sold before being rebuilt. All locomotives built for SJ were delivered with A class tenders, but some were later given six-wheeled tenders of the C, C2 and L types and a type inherited from private Helsingborg-H√§ssleholms J√§rnv√§g. The shorter six-wheeled tenders made it possible to turn the locomotives on smaller turntables. Some B class locomotives were equipped for oil-firing after the Second World War. The fireboxes were not optimal for this purpose, having been designed for coal- firing, but the results were mostly satisfactory. Today, preserved oil-fired locomotives are popular for use in summer railtours, as they are less likely than coal-fired locomotives to cause wildfires. The class remained in service with SJ until the end of steam. The need for steam locomotives declined again in the post-war era, but a large number of surplus locomotives were preserved in the strategic reserve, kept in usable condition to replace diesel-powered vehicles if the import of oil was interrupted or electric vehicles if the power supply was destroyed. The use of the reserve locomotives was mostly limited to a few trial runs, but harsh weather in the winter of 1965-1966 meant that an unusually large number of electric locomotives were out of service, and B, E and E2 class locomotives in the reserve were reactivated to haul trains on the electrified lines from Alvesta to Kalmar and Karlskrona. The B class, together with the E, E2 and E10 classes, remained in the strategic reserve after most other types had been scrapped in the 1970s. Most of the locomotives were placed in sealed plastic bags with dehumidifiers to reduce the need of maintenance. A large number of B class locomotives were preserved in that manner until all steam locomotives were removed from the strategic reserve in 1990.  Private operators  SWB A2 101 has been preserved at the Nene Valley Railway in a non-authentic livery. The locomotives built for SWB were delivered with six-wheeled tenders of this type. Six B class locomotives were sold to Bergslagernas J√§rnv√§gar (BJ) in 1935-1937, and four to Stockholm-V√§ster√•s-Bergslagens J√§rnv√§g (SWB) in 1936-1937. Three locomotives were soon transferred from BJ to close cooperator S√∂dra Dalarnes J√§rnv√§g (SDJ), but it is unclear if they were ever formally registered with that company. All these locomotives returned to SJ when the railways were nationalized in the 1940s, but the former SWB locomotives remained on the network of that company until electrification. The type was known as the B3 class at BJ and as the A class (A1 from 1943) at SWB. The cost to purchase one locomotive in used condition was 85,000 Swedish crowns; a similar amount was then needed to refurbish the locomotives before they could be used. Another B class locomotive was sold to Helsingborg-H√§ssleholms J√§rnv√§g (HHJ) in 1936, but was not intended to be used. Having been overhauled by HHJ, it was traded to BJ the year after for a H3 class locomotive. BJ sold it in 1947 to Stockholm-Nyn√§s J√§rnv√§g (SNJ), where it was given number 12, later changed to 2. SNJ had it modified for oil firing, as SJ demanded this to allow the steam locomotives of SNJ on the electrified tracks into Stockholm Central Station. The locomotive was scrapped in 1960 without having been reintegrated into the SJ fleet. The B3 class differed from other locomotives of BJ, as the driver's position never was moved from the left to the right side. They were in fact hardly modified at all during their time on BJ, meaning that two former BJ locomotives are the only ones preserved in nearly original condition. SWB did make some modifications on their locomotives: the sandboxes were moved, and the blastpipes were modified, increasing the production of steam. SWB bought used C class tenders from SJ to their locomotives, and the original A class tenders were rebuilt to tank wagons. Despite the purchase of the A1 class, SWB had too few 4-6-0 locomotives for their passenger trains. Three new A2 class locomotives were built by NOHAB in 1943-1944, based on the SJ B class. Some minor improvements were made, including fully enclosed cabs and the use of roller bearings. They were delivered with the modified sandbox position, but with unmodified blastpipes; the latter were quickly changed. The tender was of a new design, slightly larger than the C class tender, known as the B class after nationalization before being grouped with other six-wheeled tender types under the C3 designation. The former A2 class locomotives, known post nationalization a B class number 1695-1697, were last used in the 1960s in freight trains in the Dalarna region, where they were described by one driver as \\"the best steam locomotives ever built\\".  Preservation  B 1220 in operation at the ZLSM in the Netherlands. The long use of the B class in the strategic reserve meant that a large number of the locomotives survived into the 1990s, and nearly half of them have been preserved. Many locomotives remained in storage long after they had officially been removed from the strategic reserve, and interested buyers could inspect the locomotives to find the ones that were in the best condition; 38 locomotives were allocated to the Swedish Railway Museum and various heritage railways and preservation societies, although a few have been scrapped later. There were hopes that the remaining locomotives could be sold to foreign heritage railways, but the fall of communism meant that many attractive steam locomotives were available at even lower prices in Eastern Europe. A few were sold nevertheless: B 1220 and 1289 are at the Zuid- Limburgse Stoomtrein Maatschappij (ZLSM) in the Netherlands, and SWB A2 101 at Nene Valley Railway in the United Kingdom. SJ B 1149, also known as SWB A1 96, was sold to the Belfast and Moosehead Lake Railroad in Maine, United States, which became the Belfast and Moosehead Lake Railroad (2009), which sold it in 2010 to the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad which in turn sold it in 2013 to the Discovery Park of America in Tennessee. Some locomotives that had been in storage along the Inland Line were taken over by Inlandsbanan AB (IBAB), the commercial operator on that line, and B 1384 has been refurbished for use in tourist trains together with an E2 class locomotive.

During his tenure as owner, Kaufelt built Murray's Cheese into a $250 million national enterprise, representing a large share of the $17 billion specialty cheese market. More than once, Murray's Cheese was named one of the best cheese shops in the world. In addition to the flagship location on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, Kaufelt opened a branch in Grand Central Terminal in 2002 and a restaurant, Murray's Cheese Bar, in 2012. In 2005, Kaufelt entered a partnership with Ohio-based Kroger Company. By 2016, Kaufelt had 350 Murray's Cheese shops. On January 31, 2017, Kaufelt sold all of Murray's Cheese to Kroger for an undisclosed sum.  Career  Kaufelt came from a family of grocers. His paternal grandfather, Irving, was a Polish immigrant who opened Kaufelt Brothers Fancy Groceries in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1920. Rob's father, Stanley P. Kaufelt, owned Mayfair Supermarkets Inc., which operated a chain of 28 groceries trading under the banner of Foodtown. In 1995, Stanley Kaufelt sold Mayfair Supermarkets to the Dutch supermarket company Ahold. Rob joined Mayfair after graduating from Cornell University in 1969 and eventually became president. He left Mayfair in 1985 to open two specialty stores in Princeton and Summit, NJ, called Kaufelt's Fancy Groceries (after his grandfather's store). When the Princeton shop failed in 1987, Kaufelt sold the Summit location and moved to Greenwich Village. After buying Murray's Cheese in 1991, he added temperature-controlled aging caves in the basement (with a sidewalk window for customers to watch cavemasters practice affinage, or cheese aging). Kaufelt opened a classroom to instruct professionals and the public in cheese and cheese pairings, including a 3-day Cheese U Boot Camp. Nationally, Kaufelt developed the Murray's Certified Cheese Professional (CCP) program, which brought cheese in line with other professional food credentials, such as pastry chefs and sommeliers. Students must pass a rigorous test from the American Cheese Society, a not-for-profit organization founded in 1983 to support the North American artisanal and specialty cheese industry. More than 5,000 attendees have completed the training; hundreds of Murray's Cheese staff in New York and in Kroger supermarkets are certified cheese professionals. According to Edible Manhattan, Murray's was ‚Äúa launchpad for many of the most important businesses in the current good food movement.‚Äù  Publications  The Murray's Cheese Handbook (2006) Broadway Books * \\"Who Moved My Arugula\\" for The New York Times * \\"Fancy Grocery\\" for Gastronomica  Awards  * Prud Homme from La Guilde Internationale des Fromagers (2017) * Garde et Jure from La Guilde Internationale des Fromagers (2004)  Personal life  In 2010, Kaufelt married Nina Planck, a Virginia-born food writer and farmers‚Äô market entrepreneur.

The trust ‚Äî which began as a foundation in 1935, but transferred its assets to the trust in 1969 ‚Äî has provided grants, scholarships, and financial aid for the education, health, and welfare of student nurses.  History  Nurse wearing uniform from British Honduras (Helene Fuld Health Foundation foreign nurse uniform photograph collection) The story of the Helene Fuld Health Trust has three parts: (i) the Estate of Helene Fuld, who died in 1923, (ii) the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, which ran from 1935 to 1969, and (iii) the creation of the Helene Fuld Health Trust in 1969.  Estate  Helene Fuld, through probate proceedings following her death in 1923 (, under the auspices of the Estate of Helene Fuld, Deceased), devised $91,718 to her two children. Her husband (and father of her two children), Bernhard Fuld (1843‚Äì1918), had already died. Her children, Leonhard Felix Fuld (1883‚Äì1965) and Florentine Minnie Fuld (1878‚Äì1956), as devisees under her estate, shared the inheritance equally.  Foundation  In 1935, Leonhard Felix Fuld, LLM, PhD, and Florentine Minnie Fuld established the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, each contributing $5,000 in honor of their mother, Helene Fuld (n√©e Helene Schwab; 1858‚Äì1923), who had been a health care advocate and education. The Helene Fuld Health Foundation assets grew ‚Äì from $4.8 million in 1952 to more than $35 million in 1965. In 1961, Fuld ‚Äî desirous that the foundation continue after his death or incapacity ‚Äî structured a succession plan that would eventually transfer the assets to a charitable trust named the Helene Fuld Health Trust. In 1950, the foundation's address was 8 Baldwin Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.  Charitable trust  Leonhard Fuld died in 1965. Four years later, in 1969, the Foundation was dissolved according to Fuld's instructions, and the foundation assets ‚Äì around $25 million ‚Äì were transferred into the Helene Fuld Health Trust that had been created in 1950. The trust, in 1969, was managed by Marine Midland Bank, of Buffalo, as sole trustee. Marine Midland, was acquired by HSBC Bank USA in 1980 and changed its name to HSBC Bank USA in 1999.  Helene Fuld Health Foundation benefactors  Leonhard Felix Fuld was born in Manhattan in 1883. Growing up, Leonhard attended Public School 57 (on 115th Street, near Lexington), Public School 83, and for high school, the Horace Mann School (located first at 9 University Place in Greenwich Village, then, in his senior year in Morningside Heights at Teachers College. In higher education, he studied at Columbia University from about 1902 to 1909, earning five degrees: (i) a Bachelor of Arts in 1903 (completing his studies in just 1 year), (ii) a Master of Arts in 1904, (iii) a Bachelor of Laws in 1905, (iv) a Master of Laws in 1906, and (v) a PhD in Sociology and Political Economy (dissertation: \\"Police Administration,\\" 1,100 pages) in 1909. He went on to become an editor, an Examiner for the New York State Civil Service Commission and police security analyst, but his lifelong passion was public health and sanitation.

Leonhard Fuld died in 1965 at the Helene Fuld Hospital in Trenton, now known as the Capital Health Regional Medical Center.  Selected executives  * 1960s to about 1985: Gordon Alexander Philips (1917‚Äì1991) became a co-trustee of the Helene Fuld Health Foundation after the death of Leonhard Felix Fuld in 1965. In 1969, he became the President of the Helene Fuld Health Trust, a position he held until about 1971. He had served as legal counsel for the foundation in the early 1960s and in 1969, when the trust was founded, also served as legal counsel. Around that time, the trust was supporting about 170 nursing school in the United States and abroad. Philips was also the Corporate Secretary for the Helene Fuld School of Nursing in Trenton. He was also an attorney for the Helene Fuld Hospital in Trenton. Philips had also served on the New Jersey Board of Nursing for five years. He is also had been an FBI agent and municipal court judge. Philips retired in 1985. In his early days, he had attended Rutgers University and, in 1939, graduated from Wake Forest University School of Law.

It solves the problem in O(V^\\\\omega \\\\log V) expected time for a graph with V vertices, where \\\\omega < 2.373 is the exponent in the complexity O(n^\\\\omega) of n \\\\times n matrix multiplication. If only the distances between each pair of vertices are sought, the same time bound can be achieved in the worst case. Even though the algorithm is designed for connected graphs, it can be applied individually to each connected component of a graph with the same running time overall. There is an exception to the expected running time given above for computing the paths: if \\\\omega = 2 the expected running time becomes O(V^2 \\\\log^2 V).  Details of the implementation  The core of the algorithm is a procedure that computes the length of the shortest-paths between any pair of vertices. This can be done in O(V^\\\\omega \\\\log V) time in the worst case. Once the lengths are computed, the paths can be reconstructed using a Las Vegas algorithm whose expected running time is O(V^\\\\omega \\\\log V) for \\\\omega > 2 and O(V^2 \\\\log^2 V) for \\\\omega = 2.  Computing the shortest-paths lengths  The Python code below assumes the input graph is given as a n\\\\times n 0-1 adjacency matrix A with zeros on the diagonal. It defines the function APD which returns a matrix with entries D_{i,j} such that D_{i,j} is the length of the shortest path between the vertices i and j. The matrix class used can be any matrix class implementation supporting the multiplication, exponentiation, and indexing operators (for example numpy.matrix). def apd(A, n: int): \\"\\"\\"Compute the shortest-paths lengths.\\"\\"\\" if all(A[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i != j): return A Z = A ** 2 B = matrix([ [1 if i != j and (A[i][j]  1 or Z[i][j] > 0) else 0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]) T = apd(B, n) X = T*A degree = [sum(A[i][j] for j in range(n)) for i in range(n)] D = matrix([ [2 * T[i][j] if X[i][j] >= T[i][j] * degree[j] else 2 * T[i][j] - 1 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]) return D The base case tests whether the input adjacency matrix describes a complete graph, in which case all shortest paths have length 1.  Graphs with weights from finite universes  Algorithms for undirected and directed graphs with weights from a finite universe \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,M,+\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} also exist. The best known algorithm for the directed case is in time \\\\tilde{O}(M^{1/(4-\\\\omega)} V^{2+1/(4-\\\\omega)}) by Zwick in 1998. This algorithm uses rectangular matrix multiplication instead of square matrix multiplication. Better upper bounds can be obtained if one uses the best rectangular matrix multiplication algorithm available instead of achieving rectangular multiplication via multiple square matrix multiplications. The best known algorithm for the undirected case is in time \\\\tilde{O}(MV^\\\\omega) by Shoshan and Zwick in 1999. The original implementation of this algorithm was erroneous and has been corrected by Eirinakis, Williamson, and Subramani in 2016.

It has been interpreted as a sculpture created by a foreign artist that shows Herakles strangling the Nemaean lion.'Report of a tour in the Central Provinces and Lower Gangetic Doab in 1881‚Äì82' (A.S.I. vol. XVII, Calcutta, 1884), p.109-110 However, the male is wearing lion's skin, the legs of which are tied around his neck, which has been interpreted as proof that the foreign artist lacked full knowledge of the Greek mythology, because he is shown already wearing the skin of the lion he is fighting.History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE by Sonya Rhie Quintanilla p.158 The man fighting the lion in the scene is very generally considered as being Herakles, but some authors have suggested that an Indian sculptor, influenced by western art, could have meant to represent Krishna for example.Aspects of Indian Art, by Pratapaditya Pal p.7 It may also be connected to the cult of Vasudeva, who is thought to have been corresponded to the legend of Herakles. The statue is now in the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Significance The statue is similar to statues of the Lycian Apollo.The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans by John M. Rosenfield p.9 On its discovery, Cunningham wrote that the statue must be of Herakles and the Nemaean lion, that there is high probability that this was sculptured by some foreign artist for the use of the Greek resident of Mathura.'Report of a tour in the Central Provinces and Lower Gangetic Doab in 1881‚Äì82' (A.S.I. vol.

His stage name GAI is a childhood nickname meaning \\"lid\\" (Áõñ) that he was given because of his bowl cut.https://www.gq.com.cn/magazine/news_1422f6e208987cf5.html In early days as an underground rapper, GAI was leading his music label GO$H!, a local label in Chongqing, China. He is one of the few Chinese rappers actively producing trap and Gangsta rap and helped create a type of Trap music called \\"C-Trap\\". His famous songs includes \\"Gangsta\\" (Ë∂ÖÁ§æ‰ºö 2015), \\"Empty Fort Strategy\\" (Á©∫ÂüéËÆ° 2016), \\"Hot Pot Soup\\" (ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫ïÊñô 2017). In 2017, GAI's music career began to boom after attending iQiyi's Hip-Hop reality show The Rap of China, and winning the contest. In 2018, he married his girlfriend Wang Siran.  Early life  GAI was born in Yibin. His father was an accountant at a coal mine. At 10 years old his family moved to Weiyuan so his older sister could attend a better school. He became a gangster at age 13 due to school bullying; and he was put into a youth detention center at the age of 16. Due to stabbing the son of the director of the Local Tax Department during a gang fight, Gai's parents moved him to Chongqing to avoid further conflicts. He attempted to join the army but failed the health exam and instead attended Chongqing Water Resources and Electric Engineering College. After graduating college in Chongqing, Gai began to make a living by performing as a club singer, DJ or MC. Then he resigned from these positions to focus on his rap career.  Career  Underground Career As an underground rapper, GAI joined a Chongqing native gangsta rap group, \\"Brass Knuckle Gang\\" (also known as B.K.G). At this time, his song \\"Gangsta\\" (Ë∂ÖÁ§æ‰ºö) , became a major hit in Chinese underground hip hop circle. The lyrics contain a great deal of controversy in terms of social values because of the description of the true gangster life in China. And the music video was removed by the Chinese government within days after the initial release. Although this music video was banned by Chinese government people still can watch it on youtube and the mv playtimes over 4 million times on Zhong TV GAI also participated in Sing! China, a music reality show on Zhejiang Television, by his real name, but was eliminated in the first round.  The Rap Of China  GAI participated The Rap of China in summer 2017. He was chosen by producer MC HotDog and Chang Chen-yue by singing his song Hot Pot Soup, and later joined their team. By collaborating with Jackson Wang ( Papillon (2017) ), GAI reached the final stage, competing against other famous rappers such as AfterJourney, PG One and Jony J. Gai eventually tied the vote with PG One and the two shared the championship.  Music style   C-Trap  GAI's music is deeply influenced by his early life, Chinese history and Wuxia stories. He combined trap, Chinese Style Music and his dialect rapping forming the genre, which is widely known as \\"C-Trap\\". In his early rap life, his lyrics often describe the violence, sex, drugs and lives at the bottom part of Chinese society. When he started to transform from underground rapper to a mainstream rapper during The Rap of China in 2017, his choice of lyrics began to shift more into Chinese philosophy and Chinese culture. He was credited as an innovator and trailblazer of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Local Cultural Influences GAI often references Chongqing, and with Bridge has popularized the catchphrase \\"This is Fog City!\\" [ÂãíÊòØÈõæÈÉΩ, pronounced \\"less voo doo!\\"] (i.e. Chongqing). For example, he has a song named \\"Chongqing Soul\\" [ÈáçÂ∫ÜÈ≠Ç]. His music is notable for extensive use of his native Neijiang dialect, which is actually closer to Zigong dialect than Chongqing dialect. For example, his song \\"Itinerant Monk\\" Ëã¶Ë°åÂÉß (a rap version of Cui Jian's famous song \\"Fake Monk\\" ÂÅáË°åÂÉß) converts some Standard Mandarin lyrics to Sichuanese influenced Standard Chinese: Standard Mandarin: ‰ΩÜ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìÊàëÊòØË∞Å (\\"But don't know who I am\\") Sichuanese: ‰ΩÜ‰∏çÊôìÂæóÊàëÊòØÂì™‰∏™ (where Êàë is pronounced ngo and Âì™ as la) =Popular songs in Sichuan dialect= \\"Trash Talk\\" ÂûÉÂúæËØù (2018); pinyin: LƒÅ jƒ´ hu√† \\"Hot Pot Soup\\" ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫ïÊñô (2017); pinyin: Hu«ígu≈ç d«ê li√†o \\"BKG\\" Êä¢Â∏Å (2015); pinyin: Qi«éng b√¨ \\"Gangster\\" (the title itself is Sichuan dialect); Ë∂ÖÁ§æ‰ºö (2015); pinyin: ChƒÅo sh√®hu√¨  Discography  Albums =Mixtapes= Ren Yi Li Zhi Xin (2016)  Singles and EPs  =Singles= ‚ÄùGangsta\\" (as B.K.G Gai) (2015) ‚ÄúDaydreamer\\" (2015) ‚ÄùCoin Robbery (featuring Tory as B.K.G Gai)\\" (2015) ‚ÄúZhanmadao (Masiwei Diss Back)\\" (2015) ‚ÄúIronman (featuring MX)\\" (2015) ‚ÄùSupermacy (featuring Flowmatic)\\" (2015) ‚ÄúYour daddy me got upset (featuring Kenzy)\\" (2015) ‚ÄùYan Ru Yu (featuring CJ BADA$$)\\" (2015) \\"W.I.$.H\\" (2016) \\"Empty Fort Strategy\\" (2016) \\"Trash Talk\\" (2016) \\"Paper (featuring CJ BADA$$)\\" (2016) \\"Wandering Monk\\" (2016), a rap version of \\"Fake Monk\\" by Cui Jian \\"Rainbow (featuring Bridge)\\" (2017) \\"Hot Pot Soup\\" (2017) \\"Hot Pot Soup (Korea Version)\\" (2017) \\"Beware of Fire\\" (2017) \\"Blue Sea Laughter\\" (2018), a rap version of \\"Blue Sea Laughter\\" by Sam Hui (1990) \\"The Long River\\" (2018) with Damnshine (of C-BLOCK) & Bridge \\"Firefly\\" (2018) \\"The Great Wall\\"(2018) =EPs= \\"GAIn\\" (2017) =Featured in= I Wrote A Song And Got High on a Car (Tory Montana featuring GAI as B.K.G Gai) (2015) Lovely Girl (3Bangz featuring GAI) (2015) Guan Que Lou (B.Angelo featuring GAI) (2016) The Flow Of Jiang-Hu(C-Block featuring GAI) (2017) Chongqing Cypher(Tory, Bridge and GAI) (2017) Under The Setting Sun (Yaksha featuring GAI and DJ WORDY) (2017) = Promotional singles = Guess Do I Guess (featuring Bridge) (2017) King Advents (2017) Call For Dream (2017) How To Live Without Money (2017)  References   External links  Living people 1987 births Chinese singer-songwriters People from Neijiang 21st-century Chinese singers ","title":"GAI (musician)"},{"id":"55207047","text":"Decades is a 2017 double concept album by David Palfreyman and Nicholas Pegg, who co-produced it with Ian Caple.

The film began principal photography on 3 April 2017. Aadhi Pinisetty played the main antagonist and Bollywood actor Parag Tyagi debuted as a villain. Work on the film commenced under the working title PSPK25, with the final release name revealed on 27 November 2017. The film was released on 10 January 2018, during the Sankranthi festival weekend and received negative reviews from critics. This was Pawan Kalyan's final film before venturing into politics.  Plot  Govinda \\"Vindha\\" Bhargav (Boman Irani), a powerful business magnate receives the news of his son Mohan Bhargav's death in a car accident while he is in Italy. Later, armed gunmen enter his hotel room, one of whom holds up a phone, and on the other end are Vindha's friends Sharma (Murali Sharma) and Varma (Rao Ramesh), who tell him this was their plan all along, and now with his son dead as well (implying that they planned it), his \\"empire\\" has no heir. Vindha secretly records this conversation before being gunned to death by the gunmen. The news of Vindha's death, along with his belongings, reaches his wife Indrani Bhargav (Khushbu Sundar) who hears the audio file of Vindha's alleged killers. She calls her brother Appaji (Tanikella Bharani) to call for an unknown person. Appaji informs the unknown person, who is none other than Abhishikth Bhargav (Pawan Kalyan), Vindha's \\"secret\\" son. After performing his father's last rites in Varanasi, Abhi makes his way to Hyderabad, where his father's possible killers live. He scores a job in his office under the pseudonym Balasubramanyam, and makes friendships with Sukumari (Keerthy Suresh), Varma's daughter; and Suryakantham (Anu Emmanuel), Sharma's secretary who has a daughterly bond with Sharma. However, Abhi comes to know that the phone conversation must have been a fake one, since none of them have international calls registered on their phones, and now some unknown people are trying to kill him. Later that night, armed men break into his house and are killed by Abhi one after the other. The last one alive is killed in front of Indrani, only after revealing to them the true killer, Seetharam (Aadhi Pinisetty), Deenabandhu's (Sameer) (Vindha's ex- business partner who had died a few years ago) son. The police investigation behind Vindha's death led by ACP Sampath (Sampath Raj) comes to conclusion when he contemplates about Vindha's past. Govindha Bharav, a middle-class man, had set up a successful pharmaceutical company who wished to set up a factory in a remote village. However, that plan failed as Vindha refuses to bribe a local politician, who responds by provoking the villagers to attack Vindha's factory with the help of Vindha's friend Aditya Bandaru (Ajay). While escaping in a charter plane with his friends except Aditya, they discover that the briefcase containing the vile for the medicine has been shot, destroying it. However, Vindha hides a second one in a secret compartment in the same briefcase. After viewing their celebrations, he begins doubting them as well. When he goes to Bali on a holiday with his pregnant wife, there is an attempt on her life. She is presumed dead, although she is alive. Vindha senses danger to her life, thus sending her away to her brother Appaji's house. She dies shortly after giving birth to Abhi, who is raised as a person agnostic to the concept of wealth acquisition, which Vindha deems as the primary quality for someone to lead his empire after him. With Abhi's consent, he marries Indrani, who is now a mother to Mohan Bhargav. Abhi takes over the company, proclaiming he is Vindha's son. He tortures Sharma, Varma, and Koteswara Rao (Raghu Babu), who had a habit of harassing women in the workplace. When this news reaches Seetharam, he comes back to India and asks for evidence to prove that Abhi is Vindha's son. Abhi goes to Bulgaria with Sukumari and Suryakantham to recover Vindha's will, which stated that his wealth must go to Abhi. However, that will is stolen by Seetharam with Appaji's help, and by threatening Sukumari and Suryakantham that he would kill Varma and Sharma. Seetharam destroys the will by burning, thus eradicating the evidence that Abhi is Vindha's son. However, when electing the future CEO for the company, Abhi fights Seetharam's goons on the roof of the building, after revealing that the will given to Seetharam was a fake one and that Appaji was part of Abhi's plan. After killing most of Seetharam's goons, one of the board members (Jayaprakash) of the company reveals to Abhi that he is Aditya's brother, and that he was part of Vindha's murder since he wanted to avenge his brother's death. After confronting Abhi, the board member is attacked by Seetharam's henchman Parag (Parag Tyagi), and they both slip off the rooftop. While Parag falls, Aditya's brother hangs by the logo of the company.

Some parts of the film were shot in Annapurna Studios and a major sequence and a song were shot in Bangkok. The unit moved to Bulgaria on 26 October 2017 for 15 days to shoot two songs. After the foreign schedule, shooting continued in Hyderabad and was completed by the end of November 2017, including a brief period of shooting at Varanasi. In January 2018, after watching the film, French director J√©r√¥me Salle accused the makers of plagiarising his 2008 film Largo Winch and threatened to take legal action. Music The soundtrack was composed by Anirudh Ravichander, making his Tollywood debut. The first song \\"Baitikochi Chusthe\\" was unveiled on 6 November 2017, the birthday of director Trivikram Srinivas.  Release  The film was released on 10 January 2018.  Reception  Critical reception Times of India gave the film 2.5/5 stars, noting, \\"Despite all the pomp and show, ... 'Agnyaathavaasi' has been an amazing ride had it either been taken seriously or been made with the same old Trivikram-Pawan Kalyan touch. However, the film lacks soul ... Pawan Kalyan aces through his role as usual, even if his body language and expressions ooze disinterest. The Indian Express rated the film 2/5 and stated \\"Agnyaathavaasi is not the film we expected to see this holiday. It is strictly for fans of Power Star as Trivikram has spent the entire runtime gushing over Pawan Kalyan.\\" The Hindu said \\"The film is beautifully shot (cinematography by Manikandan) and Anirudh Ravichander comes up with refreshing music that gives a classy sheen to this urban masala film. But these aren‚Äôt enough to salvage the film.\\"  Plagiarism allegations  French director J√©r√¥me Salle alleged that the film was plagiarised from his 2008 film Largo Winch. Following this, T-Series, which owns the remake rights of French film Largo Winch, sent a legal notice to the makers of the film, asking for the censored copy of the film. It was later reported that T-Series was demanding Rs 15 crore from the makers of Agnyaathavaasi for allegedly violating copyright. The agreement between Agnyaathavaasi makers and T-Series management was amicably closed after the makers agreed to compensate them after taking into consideration that though the director had not taken the entire plotline of Largo Winch, he had written a few key scenes of Agnyaathavaasi based on scenes from the French film. Box office The film grossed 95 crores against a budget of 70 crores.

Most Ohio petroglyphs have been found exposed to the elements, but the Independence Slab was noted to have been buried under a layer of soil prior to its discovery. Today, the Independence Slab is still embedded in the walls of the Independence Presbyterian Church which is located near the Independence Public Square on Brecksville Road.

The Incorporations have never referred to themselves as guilds; indeed they came into existence, mostly in the latter part of the fifteenth century, in order to counter the growing power of the merchant guild, known as the Royal Company of Merchants of the City of Edinburgh. By 1562 the Incorporations formed what became known as The Convenery of Trades of Edinburgh, an umbrella body that still exists and which looks after the interests of all the Incorporated Trades of the burgh. The Convenery consists, in the narrow sense of the word, of the Deacons of each of the Incorporations, plus the two Trades Councillors. In the broad sense of the word, however, the term \\"Convenery of Trades\\" embraces all the Freemen of all the Incorporated Trades of the Burgh, together with their journeymen and apprentices, in a convivial fellowship of mutual support. Until 1833 the Deacons of the fourteen Incorporated Trades sat with the Town Council in their deliberations. In 1583 the Act of Sett of the Burgh laid down that six of the Deacons, known as the Council Deacons, should sit as full Council members at all meetings of the Council, and the remaining eight Deacons, known as Extraordinary Deacons, were to sit with the Council only when certain topics of business were being discussed and to take full part in the annual elections of Councillors and office-bearers. Historically it was necessary to become a Burgess of the Burgh before one could be admitted as a Freeman of one of the Incorporations. Once an applicant had submitted his essay and been accepted as a Freeman, he was expected to set up his own business and to employ journeymen and train apprentices. The Incorporations were able to prevent any outsiders from practising their trade in the Burgh until they had paid their dues to the appropriate incorporated trade. Origins and background The Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh historically held the power to regulate their various trades in the town. There are fifteen incorporations in Edinburgh, fourteen of which had Deacons who were permanent members of the Convenery of Trades from its beginning. Unlike the worshipful companies of London which are given precedence based on their date of founding, the trades are given precedence by the Act of Sett of the Burgh of Edinburgh, in a \\"decreet arbitral\\" by King James VI in 1583. The cited reason for this was that many of the trades \\"no longer possessed their original seals of cause and did not know the year in which they had been founded\\". Each trade elects a Deacon ‚Äì an office dating back to an Act of Parliament in 1424. Their role was originally one of quality control. To ensure the products of their respective trade matched up to the standards expected of the craft. The role of Deacon later became combined with the role of that of Kirkmaster (treasurer). The privilege of the Deacons sitting on the Town Council was rescinded following the passage of the Scottish Burgh Reform Act in 1833. The Deacons undertook other work, for example The Deacon of the Goldsmiths was also the Assay-Master at the Edinburgh Assay Office until 1681 (an organisation that they still operate to this day). Over time they took on roles as trustees of various charities. They were also the Governors of the Edinburgh Trades Maiden Hospital, founded by the Craftsmen of Edinburgh and Mary Erskine (1629-1707). This charity still exists but its name was changed in 2015 to the Edinburgh Trades Fund. The Convenery of the Trades of Edinburgh consists of the deacons of all the incorporated trades and today acts as the ruling body of the Incorporated Trades. Its present-day main focus is the various charities and events operated by the Incorporated Trades. They also assist the various Incorporated Trades wherever they can. The Convenery is headed by the Deacon- Convener of the Trades of Edinburgh, who holds the distinction of being the first tradesman in Scotland, and third citizen of Edinburgh after the Lord Provost and the Lord Dean of Guild. From 1598 until 1858 the Convenery of Trades met in The Magdalen Chapel in Cowgate. Today it meets at its own headquarters, known as Ashfield, 61 Melville Street, which also contains a dedicated museum. Membership In order to become a Freeman of any of the trades one used to have to become a Burgess of the City of Edinburgh first. The grant of Burgesship was historically the gift of the Lord Dean of Guild, an office in the Council of the City of Edinburgh. However, Local Government Reform in 1973 changed this precedent and the office of Lord Dean of Guild was transferred instead to the Merchant Company of Edinburgh. Though the City of Edinburgh council retained the power to grant Burgess-ship, it came to be awarded only honorarily to those who \\"have distinguished themselves through their work or efforts, or to recognise the respect and high esteem in which they are held by the people of Edinburgh\\". This caused an issue for the Incorporated Trades, as it meant prospective Freemen first had to approach the Merchant Company of Edinburgh to get their Burgess ticket, before they could join their trade. Edinburgh City Council arbitrated an agreement between the Merchants and the Craftsmen, and now nominations for Burgess-ship are accepted from either organisation, adjudicated by a committee with representatives from both the Merchant Company and the Convenery of Trades and chaired by the Lord Dean of Guild. In 2017 a new body was created, called the Burgess Association of Edinburgh, to include all the Burgesses of the City, thus fostering friendship and co-operation between the Merchant Company and the Convenery of Trades. Present-day activities Many of the trades have taken on a more charitable focus, and some even accept Freemen who have not received a Burgess ticket. The Incorporation of Surgeons is now The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and operates as one of the four surgical colleges in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the others being The Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The Incorporation held the unusual privilege of being the only body with a monopoly on the distilling of alcohol (\\"aquavite\\") in the burgh. The Incorporation of Goldsmiths owns and operates the Edinburgh Assay Office. Today its Freemen include jewellers, gold and silver smiths, bankers and financiers. Historically, many of its membership helped form the Bank of Scotland in 1695. It retains the statutory role of assaying and hallmarking gold, silver, platinum and palladium wares before they can be sold. The Kirking of the Deacons :Every year the Deacons are \\"kirked\\" at Beltane, in a ceremony, known as The Kirking of the Deacons, in which the Deacons march in ceremonial dress along with their banner-bearers, led by the Convenery's Officer bearing the Blue Blanket, under escort from the High Constables of Edinburgh, from Candlemakers' Hall to Greyfriars Kirk. They are met by the Lord Provost and some of the Council where a ceremony is conducted by the Convenery's Chaplain. Psalms and hymns are sung and Clement Cor's Prayer, the traditional dedicatory prayer of the Convenery, is said. This is followed by a procession from the church to the grave of Mary Erskine, with whom the Incorporated Trades founded the Trades Maiden Hospital 1704. Before the Local Council Reform of 1973, this ceremony was undertaken by the entirety of Edinburgh Council, where they would be \\"reminded of their duties and responsibilities and were charged with the responsibility of doing their civic duty impartially and to the best of their ability.\\" The Riding of the Marches This is a modern revival of a tradition that stopped in the early 1700s. It is an annual event held in Edinburgh to commemorate the return in the year 1513 of the Captain of the City Band, Randolph Murray clasping the Ancient 'Blue Blanket Banner' (the banner of the Edinburgh tradesmen, said to have been awarded to the craftsmen of Edinburgh by James III in 1482) with news of the defeat of the Scottish Army at the Battle of Flodden.
