Handbook of British Chronology p. 228 He was appointed Lord Chancellor on 20 June 1467 and held the office until 29 September 1470, when Henry VI was restored to the throne. After the return of Edward IV, he was reappointed to his former office and held it until 18 June 1473, when Edward dismissed him.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 87 In 1478, Stillington spent some weeks in prison, apparently as a result of some association with the disgraced George, Duke of Clarence. It has been suggested that he gave Clarence information about the king's prior association with another woman, information that would have put Clarence in a position to claim the throne for himself. After Edward's death in April 1483, Stillington was a member of the council of the boy-king Edward V. Some time in June, a clergyman, identified as Stillington only by the writings [M√©moires, book VI chapter 17] of the French diplomat Philippe de Commines (who referred to him as \\"levesque de Bas\\" and \\"ce mauvais evesque\\"), told Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Protector, that the marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid on the grounds of Edward's earlier marriage to Lady Eleanor Talbot, at which he claimed to have officiated. This led to Elizabeth Woodville's children by Edward IV being declared illegitimate and the Duke of Gloucester ascending the throne as Richard III. After Henry VII defeated Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, he immediately had Stillington imprisoned again. Henry had the bigamy charge against Edward IV reversed, and married Edward's daughter, Elizabeth of York. Some years after Stillington's second release, he became involved in the plot to place the impostor Lambert Simnel on the throne in 1487. After finding refuge at Oxford University, he was eventually handed over to the king and died in prison. He was buried in a chapel of his own founding at Wells Cathedral.Dictionary of National Biography Citations References 15th-century Roman Catholic bishops Bishops of Bath and Wells Archdeacons of Taunton Archdeacons of Berkshire Lord Chancellors of England Lords Privy Seal 15th-century English clergy People of the Tudor period 1420 births 1491 deaths ","title":"Robert Stillington"},{"id":"248492","title":"Newark Liberty International Airport"},{"id":"248497","text":"Representation of Sabbath gatherings from the chronicles of Johann Jakob Wick The Witches' Sabbath is a phrase that became popular in the 20th century to denote a gathering of those considered to practice witchcraft and other rites. Origins =Emergence in the 20th century= Prior to the late 19th century, it is difficult to locate any English use of the term sabbath to denote a gathering of witches. The phrase is used by Henry Charles Lea's in his History of the Inquisition (1888).American historian GL Burr does not seem to use the term in his essay \\"The Literature of Witchcraft\\" presented to the American Historical Association in 1890. Writing in 1900, German historian Joseph Hansen who was a correspondent and a German translator of Lea's work, frequently uses the shorthand phrase hexensabbat to interpret medieval trial records, though any consistently recurring term is noticeably rare in the copious Latin sources Hansen also provides (see more on various Latin synonyms, below).Joseph Hansen Zauberwahn (1900) also see companion volume of sources Quellen (1901) Lea and Hansen's influence may have led to a broader use of the shorthand phrase, including in English. Prior to Hansen, German use of the term also seems to have been rare and the compilation of German folklore by Jakob Grimm in the 1800s (Kinder und HausM√§rchen, Deutsche Mythologie) seems to contain no mention of hexensabbat or any other form of the term sabbat relative to fairies or magical acts.Grimm, Kinder und HausM√§rchen (1843 ed, 2nd Volume) The contemporary of Grimm and early historian of witchcraft, WG Soldan also doesn't seem to use the term in his history (1843). =A French connection= In contrast to German and English counterparts, French writers (including Francophone authors writing in Latin) occasionally did use the term and there would seem to be roots to inquisitorial persecution of the Waldensians. In 1124, the term inzabbatos is used to describe the Waldensians in Northern Spain.Phillipus van Limborch, History of Inquisition (1692), English translation (1816) p. 88, original Latin here In 1438 and 1460, seemingly related terms synagogam and synagogue of Sathan are used to describe Waldensians by inquisitors in France. These terms could be a reference to Revelation 2:9. (...\\"I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\\") Hansen, Quellen (1901) p.186The verse in Revelation is pointed to by Wolfgang Behringer, Witches and Witch-Hunts(2004) p.60 Writing in Latin in 1458, Francophone author Nicolas Jacquier applies synagogam fasciniorum to what he considers a gathering of witches.Nicolaus Jacquier Flagellum (printed 1581) p. 40 About 150 years later, near the peak of the witch-phobia and the persecutions which led to the execution of an estimated 40,000-100,000 persons,Alison Rowlands, Witchcraft Narratives in Germany, Rothenburg,1561-1652 (Manchester, 2003), 10.\\"...the fear of a monstrous conspiracy of Devil-worshipping witches was fairly recent, and indeed modern scholarship has confirmed that massive witch hunts occurred almost exclusively in the early modern period, reaching their peak intensity during the century 1570-1670.\\" Benjamin G. Kohl and H.C. Erik Midelfort, editors, On Witchcraft An Abridged Translation of Johann Weyer's De praestigiis daemonun. Translation by John Shea (North Carolina, 1998) xvi. with roughly 80% being women,Per Scarre & Callow (2001),\\"Records suggest that in Europe, as a whole, about 80 per cent of trial defendants were women, though the ratio of women to men charged with the offence varied from place to place, and often, too, in one place over time.\\"\\"Menopausal and post-menopausal women were disproportionally represented amongst the victims of the witch craze--and their over- representation is the more striking when we recall how rare women over fifty must have been in the population as a whole.\\" Lyndal Roper Witch Craze (2004)p. 160 the witch-phobic French and Francophone writers still seem to be the only ones using these related terms, although still infrequently and sporadically in most cases. Lambert Daneau uses sabbatha one time (1581) as Synagogas quas Satanica sabbatha.Daneau's work is included with Jacquier in 1581 printing, link above. See p. 242. Nicholas Remi uses the term occasionally as well as synagoga (1588). Jean Bodin uses the term three times (1580) and, across the channel, the Englishman Reginald Scot (1585) writing a book in opposition to witch-phobia, uses the term but only once in quoting Bodin. (The Puritan Richard Baxter writing much later (1691) also uses the term only once in the exact same way‚Äìquoting Bodin. Other witch-phobic English Puritans who were Baxter's contemporaries, like Increase and Cotton Mather (1684, 1689, 1692), did not use the term, perhaps because they were Sabbatarians.) In 1611, Jacques Fontaine uses sabat five times writing in French and in a way that would seem to correspond with modern usage. Finally, writing a witch-phobic work in French the following year (1612), Pierre de Lancre seems to use the term more frequently than anyone before. Pierre de Lancre p. 74 Following more than two hundred years after Pierre de Lancre, another French writer Lamothe-Langon (whose character and scholarship was questioned in the 1970s) uses the term in (presumably) translating into French a handful of documents from the inquisition in Southern France. Joseph Hansen cited Lamothe-Langon as one of many sources. A term favored by recent translators Despite the infrequency of the use of the word sabbath to denote any such gatherings in the historical record, it became increasingly popular during the 20th century. =Caution Criminalis= In a 2003 translation of Friedrich Spee's Cautio Criminalis (1631) the word sabbaths is listed in the index with a large number of entries.Translation by Marcus Hellyer,(UVA Press, 2003)p.232. However, unlike some of Spee's contemporaries in France (mentioned above), who occasionally, if rarely, use the term sabbatha, Friedrich Spee does not ever use words derived from sabbatha or synagoga. Spee was German- speaking, and like his contemporaries, wrote in Latin. Conventibus is the word Spee uses most frequently to denote a gathering of witches, whether supposed or real, physical or spectral, as seen in the first paragraph of question one of his book.Available here and also see p.398. This is the same word from which English words convention, convent, and coven are derived. Cautio Criminalis (1631) was written as a passionate innocence project. As a Jesuit, Spee was often in a position of witnessing the torture of those accused of witchcraft. =Malleus Maleficarum= In a 2009 translation of Dominican inquisitor Heinrich Kramer's somewhat influential Malleus Maleficarum (1486), the word sabbath does not occur. A line describing a supposed gathering and using concionem is accurately translated as an assembly. But in the accompanying footnote, the translator seems to apologize for the lack of both the term sabbath and a general scarcity of other gatherings that would seem to fit the bill for what he refers to as a \\"black sabbath\\".\\"It is sometimes argued that the Malleus was of minor influence in the spread of the conception of sorcery as a satanic cult because the black sabbath, which formed a major element in later notions of sorcery, receives little emphasis. Yet, here the black sabbath clearly is mentioned...\\" --footnote 74, Christopher S. Mackay, The Hammer of Witches, A Complete Translation of Malleus Maleficarum p. 283 fn. 74. The original work with the line Mackay refers to is page 208 as found here. =Fine art= The phrase is also popular in recent translations of the titles of artworks, including: *The Witches' Sabbath by Hans Baldung (1510) * Witches' Sabbath by Frans Francken (1606) * Witches' Sabbath in Roman Ruins by Jacob van Swanenburgh (1608) * As a recent translation from the original Spanish El aquelarre to the English title Witches' Sabbath (1798) and Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat (1823) both works by Francisco Goya * Muse of the Night (Witches' Sabbath) by Luis Ricardo Falero (1880) Disputed accuracy of the accounts of gatherings Modern researchers have been unable to find any corroboration with the notion that physical gatherings of practitioners of witchcraft occurred. The historian Scott E. Hendrix presents a two-fold explanation for why these stories were so commonly told in spite of the fact that sabbats likely never actually occurred in his study \\"The Pursuit of Witches and the Sexual Discourse of the Sabbat.\\" First, belief in the real power of witchcraft grew during the late medieval and early-modern Europe as a doctrinal view in opposition to the canon Episcopi gained ground in certain communities. This fueled a paranoia among certain religious authorities that there was a vast underground conspiracy of witches determined to overthrow Christianity. Women beyond child-bearing years provided an easy target and were scapegoated and blamed for famines, plague, warfare, and other problems. Having prurient and orgiastic elements helped ensure that these stories would be relayed to others. =Ritual elements= Bristol University's Ronald Hutton has encapsulated the witches' sabbath as an essentially modern construction, saying: The book Compendium Maleficarum (1608) by Francesco Maria Guazzo illustrates a typical witch-phobic view of gathering of witches as \\"the attendants riding flying goats, trampling the cross, and being re-baptised in the name of the Devil while giving their clothes to him, kissing his behind, and dancing back to back forming a round.\\" In effect, the sabbat acted as an effective 'advertising' gimmick, causing knowledge of what these authorities believed to be the very real threat of witchcraft to be spread more rapidly across the continent. That also meant that stories of the sabbat promoted the hunting, prosecution, and execution of supposed witches. The descriptions of Sabbats were made or published by priests, jurists and judges who never took part in these gatherings, or were transcribed during the process of the witchcraft trials. That these testimonies reflect actual events is for most of the accounts considered doubtful. Norman Cohn argued that they were determined largely by the expectations of the interrogators and free association on the part of the accused, and reflect only popular imagination of the times, influenced by ignorance, fear, and religious intolerance towards minority groups. Witches' Sabbath by Frans Francken the Younger Some of the existing accounts of the Sabbat were given when the person recounting them was being tortured. p. 252 and so motivated to agree with suggestions put to them. Christopher F. Black claimed that the Roman Inquisition‚Äôs sparse employment of torture allowed accused witches to not feel pressured into mass accusation. This in turn means there were fewer alleged groups of witches in Italy and places under inquisitorial influence. Because the Sabbath is a gathering of collective witch groups, the lack of mass accusation means Italian popular culture was less inclined to believe in the existence of Black Sabbath. The Inquisition itself also held a skeptical view toward the legitimacy of Sabbath Assemblies. Many of the diabolical elements of the Witches' Sabbath stereotype, such as the eating of babies, poisoning of wells, desecration of hosts or kissing of the devil's anus, were also made about heretical Christian sects, lepers, Muslims, and Jews. The term is the same as the normal English word \\"Sabbath\\" (itself a transliteration of Hebrew \\"Shabbat\\", the seventh day, on which the Creator rested after creation of the world), referring to the witches' equivalent to the Christian day of rest; a more common term was \\"synagogue\\" or \\"synagogue of Satan\\" possibly reflecting anti-Jewish sentiment, although the acts attributed to witches bear little resemblance to the Sabbath in Christianity or Jewish Shabbat customs. The Errores Gazariorum (Errors of the Cathars), which mentions the Sabbat, while not discussing the actual behavior of the Cathars, is named after them, in an attempt to link these stories to an heretical Christian group. Christian missionaries' attitude to African cults was not much different in principle to their attitude to the Witches' Sabbath in Europe; some accounts viewed them as a kind of Witches' Sabbath, but they are not.Park, Robert E., \\"Review of Life in a Haitian Valley,\\" American Journal of Sociology Vol. 43, No. 2 (Sep., 1937), pp. 346‚Äì348. Some African communities believe in witchcraft, but as in the European witch trials, people they believe to be \\"witches\\" are condemned rather than embraced. =Possible connections to real groups= Other historians, including Carlo Ginzburg, √âva P√≥cs, Bengt Ankarloo and Gustav Henningsen hold that these testimonies can give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg famously discovered records of a group of individuals in northern Italy, calling themselves benandanti, who believed that they went out of their bodies in spirit and fought amongst the clouds against evil spirits to secure prosperity for their villages, or congregated at large feasts presided over by a goddess, where she taught them magic and performed divinations. Ginzburg links these beliefs with similar testimonies recorded across Europe, from the armiers of the Pyrenees, from the followers of Signora Oriente in fourteenth century Milan and the followers of Richella and 'the wise Sibillia' in fifteenth century northern Italy, and much further afield, from Livonian werewolves, Dalmatian kresniki, Hungarian t√°ltos, Romanian cƒÉlu≈üari and Ossetian burkudzauta. In many testimonies these meetings were described as out-of-body, rather than physical, occurrences. =Role of topically-applied hallucinogens= Frequent ointment ingredient : Deadly Nightshade : Atropa belladonna > Magic ointments...produced effects which the subjects themselves believed > in, even stating that they had intercourse with evil spirits, had been at > the Sabbat and danced on the Brocken with their lovers...The peculiar > hallucinations evoked by the drug had been so powerfully transmitted from > the subconscious mind to consciousness that mentally uncultivated > people...believed them to be reality.

Original German > edition 1924. Carlo Ginzburg's researches have highlighted shamanic elements in European witchcraft compatible with (although not invariably inclusive of) drug-induced altered states of consciousness. In this context, a persistent theme in European witchcraft, stretching back to the time of classical authors such as Apuleius, is the use of unguents conferring the power of \\"flight\\" and \\"shape- shifting.\\" Harner, Michael J., Hallucinogens and Shamanism, pub. Oxford University Press 1973, reprinted U.S.A.1978 Chapter 8 : pps. 125‚Äì150 : The Role of Hallucinogenic Plants in European Witchcraft. A number of recipes for such \\"flying ointments\\" have survived from early modern times, permitting not only an assessment of their likely pharmacological effects ‚Äì based on their various plant (and to a lesser extent animal) ingredients ‚Äì but also the actual recreation of and experimentation with such fat or oil-based preparations.Hansen, Harold A. The Witch's Garden pub. Unity Press 1978 It is surprising (given the relative wealth of material available) that Ginzburg makes only the most fleeting of references to the use of entheogens in European witchcraft at the very end of his extraordinarily wide-ranging and detailed analysis of the Witches Sabbath, mentioning only the fungi Claviceps purpurea and Amanita muscaria by name, and confining himself to but a single paragraph on the 'flying ointment' on page 303 of 'Ecstasies...' : > In the Sabbath the judges more and more frequently saw the accounts of real, > physical events. For a long time the only dissenting voices were those of > the people who, referring back to the Canon episcopi, saw witches and > sorcerers as the victims of demonic illusion.

Ergot and the Fly Agaric mushroom, while undoubtedly hallucinogenic, Schultes, Richard Evans; Hofmann, Albert (1979). The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens (2nd ed.).

It is one of only four national anthems in the world (along with those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and San Marino) that have no official lyrics (although it had lyrics in the past, they are no longer used). One of the oldest in the world, the Spanish national anthem was first printed in a document dated 1761 and entitled Libro de la Ordenanza de los Toques de P√≠fanos y Tambores que se tocan nuevamente en la Ynfant¬™ Espa√±ola (Book of the Ordenance of Newly Played Military Drum and Fife Calls by The Spanish Infantry), by Manuel de Espinosa. There, it is entitled \\"\\" (). According to the document, Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros is the composer. There is a misconception that its author was Frederick II of Prussia, a great lover of music. That mistaken belief arose in 1861 when it was published as fact in the periodical (Military Spain). In 1864, Col. Antonio Vallecillo published the story in the diary (The Public Spirit), claiming a supposed Prussian origin for Marcha Real. According to Vallecillo, the anthem was a gift from Frederick II to the soldier Juan Mart√≠n √Ålvarez de Sotomayor, who was serving in the Prussian Court to learn the military tactics developed by Frederick II's army, under orders of King Charles III. In 1868, this spurious history was published in , changing the beneficiary of the gift to Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda. The myth was picked up in different publications of 1884 and 1903 until it was included in 1908 in the Enciclopedia Espasa. In 1770, Charles III declared the \\"Marcha de Granaderos\\" the official Honor March, an act that formalized the tradition of playing it in public, especially on solemn occasions. It became the official Spanish anthem during Isabel II's reign. In 1870, after the 1868 Revolution, General Juan Prim organized a national contest to create a new official state anthem, and a jury consisting of three well-known composers was chosen to designate a winning entry. Although over 400 compositions were submitted, including those written by the young composers Federico Chueca, Ruperto Chap√≠ and Tom√°s Bret√≥n, a new anthem was never selected. After extensive deliberations, the jury had advised that \\"Marcha de Granaderos\\" was already considered the country's official anthem, and the contest was suspended. By Alfonso XIII's time, the Royal Circular Order of 27 August 1908 established the musical score orchestrated by Bartolom√© P√©rez Casas, Superior musician of the Royal Corps of Halberdier Guards, as the official version; it is known traditionally as the \\"Grenadier March\\" or the \\"Royal Spanish March\\". During the Spanish Second Republic the Himno de Riego was adopted as the anthem of the republic. The actual symphonic version of the \\"Marcha Real\\" that replaced the P√©rez Casas one was written by maestro Francisco Grau and is the official one after the Royal Decree of 10 October 1997, when the Kingdom of Spain bought the author rights of the Marcha Real, then belonging to P√©rez Casas's heirs. According to the Royal Decree 1560/1997, it should be in the key of B-flat major and a tempo of 76 bpm (‚ô©=76), with a form of AABB and a duration of 52 seconds. Current version The current official version of \\"Marcha Real\\", as described in Royal Decree 1560/1997, is a sixteen-bar long phrase, divided in two sections, each one is made up of four repeated bars (AABB form). Tempo is set to ‚ô©= 76 and key to B-flat. The long, complete version is the honors music for the King, while a shorter version without the repetitions is performed for the Princess of Asturias, the President of the Government of Spain, or during sporting events. There are also three official arrangements: one for orchestra, another for military band, and a third for organ, written by Francisco Grau Vegara and requested by the Government of Spain. All in all, there are six different official adaptations, for each arrangement and length. They all were recorded by the Spanish National Orchestra and the Spanish Royal Guard Band as an official recording and released on compact disc for a limited period of time. =Copyright issues= As the harmonisation of \\"Marcha Real\\" was written by P√©rez Casas in the early 20th century, the copyright has not yet expired. The government bought it from P√©rez Casas' estate in 1997 for 130 million pesetas (781,315.734 euros) to avoid future legal problems. Until it expires, the copyright belongs to the Ministry of Culture and collecting societies charge copyright fees, which has led to criticism.\\"El himno da a√∫n mucho dinero\\". Cr√≥nica. #604. May 27, 2007. \\"Cuando el himno es de un particular\\". Periodista Digital. May 27, 2007. As a result, many different harmonisations have been devised by performers to avoid paying. Nonetheless, the rights to the 1997 Francisco Grau revision were transferred to the government at no charge, but they were not placed in the public domain.

One version was used during Alfonso XIII's reign and another during the Francoist State; however, none of them were ever made official. The national anthem has been played without words since 1978, when the lyrics that had been approved by General Francisco Franco were abandoned. =Lyrics competition= After witnessing a rendition of \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee (COE), Alejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to \\"La Marcha Real\\" ahead of Madrid's bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games.Liverpool fans help inspire Spain to write words to anthem Reuters, 5 June 2007Spain to add lyrics to wordless national anthem NBC News, 26 June 2007\\"Lost for Words\\", The Economist, Vol 384 Number 8539. That same year Telecinco, enticed by the COE, organized a National contest and posted 25 different lyrics on their website which they thought best matched COE's requirements. The winner was chosen after 40,000 people voted. The lyrics by Enrique Hern√°ndez-Luike, magazine publisher and poet, spoke of freedom, peace and the Constitution. The winning lyrics were sung by the Ronda de Aranzueque choir in Pastrana, and filmed by German television. However, the COE organized a new competition for the lyrics, which resulted in between 2,000 and 7,000 entries (depending on source). A private team of jurors chose the entry by Paulino Cubero, then unemployed. The new lyrics received criticism, resulting in them being pulled only five days later, and the idea was scrapped indefinitely. A number of the autonomous communities of Spain have their own regional anthems.

Interpretation and etiquette Military bands of the Spanish Armed Forces and the National Police Corps of Spain and civilian Marching bands and Concert bands play the B flat- major version of the anthem adapted for wind bands (as arranged by Francisco Grau), and playing the A major version is optional. The bugle call \\"To the Colors\\" in Spain is the version played by Bugle bands in Spanish churches in religious occasions and processions organized by civil groups and the parishes. Various versions adapted for the drum and the bugle are used, even though brass instruments play the anthem as well. But in some bugle bands, the A flat version of the anthem (the old official one, adapted for the bugle) is played. Only a bugle call is sounded when the B flat version is played. Being the national anthem, and played in honor of the King and the Queen of Spain, it is common for all to stand once it is played. Even though it is also played in church events, respect for the royal family is required by everyone in attendance; civilians stand at attention, and those in uniform salute when not in formation.

It is a large robust kingfisher with a whitish head and a brown eye-stripe. The upperparts are mostly dark brown but there is a mottled light- blue patch on the wing coverts. The underparts are cream-white and the tail is barred with rufous and black. The plumage of the male and female birds is similar. The territorial call is a distinctive laugh that is often delivered by several birds at the same time, and is widely used as a stock sound effect in situations that involve a jungle setting. The laughing kookaburra is native to eastern mainland Australia, but has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia. It occupies dry eucalypt forest, woodland, city parks and gardens. This species is sedentary and occupies the same territory throughout the year. It is monogamous, retaining the same partner for life. A breeding pair can be accompanied by up to five fully grown non-breeding offspring from previous years that help the parents defend their territory and raise their young. The laughing kookaburra generally breeds in unlined tree holes or in excavated holes in arboreal termite nests. The usual clutch is three white eggs. The parents and the helpers incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. The youngest of the three nestlings or chicks is often killed by the older siblings. When the chicks fledge they continue to be fed by the group for six to ten weeks until they are able to forage independently. A predator of a wide variety of small animals, the laughing kookaburra typically waits perched on a branch until it sees an animal on the ground and then flies down and pounces on its prey.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. Its diet includes lizards, insects, worms, snakes, mice and it is known to take goldfish out of garden ponds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classed the laughing kookaburra as a species of least concern as it has a large range and population, with no widespread threats. Taxonomy The laughing kookaburra was first described and illustrated (in black and white) by the French naturalist and explorer Pierre Sonnerat in his Voyage √† la nouvelle Guin√©e, which was published in 1776. He claimed to have seen the bird in New Guinea. In fact Sonnerat never visited New Guinea and the laughing kookaburra does not occur there. He probably obtained a preserved specimen from one of the naturalists who accompanied Captain James Cook to the east coast of Australia. Edme-Louis Daubenton and Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet included a coloured plate of the laughing kookaburra based on Sonnerat's specimen in their Planches enlumin√©es d'histoire naturelle. The plate has the legend in French \\"Martin-pecheur, de la Nouvelle Guin√©e\\" (Kingfisher from New Guinea). In 1783, the French naturalist Johann Hermann provided a formal description of the species based on the coloured plate by Daubenton and Martinet. He gave it the scientific name Alcedo nov√¶ Guine√¶. The current genus Dacelo was introduced in 1815 by the English zoologist William Elford Leach, and is an anagram of Alcedo, the Latin word for a kingfisher. The specific epithet novaeguineae combines the Latin novus for new with Guinea, based on the erroneous belief that the specimen had originated from New Guinea. For many years it was believed that the earliest description was by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert and his scientific name Dacelo gigas was used in the scientific literature, but in 1926 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews showed that a description by Hermann had been published earlier in the same year, 1783, and thus had precedence. The inaccurate impression of geographic distribution given by the name in current usage had not by 1977 been considered an important enough matter to force a change in favor of D. gigas. In the 19th century this species was commonly called the \\"laughing jackass\\", a name first recorded (as Laughing Jack-Ass) in An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales by David Collins which was published in 1798. In 1858 the ornithologist John Gould used \\"great brown kingfisher\\", a name that had been coined by John Latham in 1782. Another popular name was \\"laughing kingfisher\\". The names in several Australian indigenous languages were listed by European authors including Go-gan-ne-gine by Collins in 1798, Cuck'anda by Ren√© Lesson in 1828 and Gogera or Gogobera by George Bennett in 1834. In the early years of the 20th century \\"kookaburra\\" was included as an alternative name in ornithological publications, but it was not until 1926 in the second edition of the Official Checklist of Birds of Australia that the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union officially adopted the name \\"laughing kookaburra\\". The name comes from Wiradjuri, an endangered Aboriginal language. The genus Dacelo contains four kookaburra species of which the rufous-bellied kookaburra and the spangled kookaburra are restricted to New Guinea and islands in the Torres Straits. The blue-winged kookaburra and the laughing kookaburra are both widespread in Australia. Two subspecies are recognised: * D. n. novaeguineae (Hermann, 1783) ‚Äì the nominate subspecies, east Australia, Tasmania and southwest Australia * D. n. minor Robinson, 1900 ‚Äì Cape York Peninsula south to Cooktown Description Large bill and head detail In Royal National Park, NSW The laughing kookaburra is the largest kingfisher. It is a stout, stocky bird in length, with a large head, prominent brown eyes, and a long and robust bill.Pizzey, Graham and Doyle, Roy. (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. The sexes are very similar, although the female is usually larger and has less blue to the rump than the male. The male weighs , mean and the female , mean .Woodall, P. F. (2020). \\"Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.laukoo1.01 They have a white or cream-coloured body and head with a dark brown stripe across each eye and more faintly over the top of the head. The wings and back are brown with sky blue spots on the shoulders. The tail is rusty reddish-orange with dark brown bars and white tips on the feathers. The heavy bill is black on top and bone-coloured on the bottom. The subspecies D. n. minor has a similar plumage to the nominate but is smaller in size. The laughing kookaburra can be distinguished from the similarly sized blue-winged kookaburra by its dark eye, dark eye-stripe, shorter bill and the smaller and duller blue areas on the wing and rump. Male blue-winged kookaburras also differ in having a barred blue and black tail. =Call= 200x200px The name \\"laughing kookaburra\\" refers to the bird's \\"laugh\\", which it uses to establish territory among family groups. It can be heard at any time of day, but most frequently at dawn and dusk. Laughing Kookaburra in an urban environment One bird starts with a low, hiccuping chuckle, then throws its head back in raucous laughter: often several others join in. If a rival tribe is within earshot and replies, the whole family soon gathers to fill the bush with ringing laughter. The laughing chorus has 5 variable elements: 1. \\"Kooa\\"; 2. \\"Cackle\\"; 3. \\"Rolling\\", a rapidly repeated \\"oo-oo-oo\\"; 4. Loud \\"Ha-ha\\"; followed by 5. Male's call of \\"Go-go\\" or female's call of \\"Gurgle\\". Hearing kookaburras in full voice is one of the more extraordinary experiences of the Australian bush, something even locals cannot ignore; some visitors, unless forewarned, may find their calls startling. Distribution and habitat The laughing kookaburra is native to eastern Australia and has a range that extends from the Cape York Peninsula in the north to Cape Otway in the south. It is present on both the eastern and the western sides of the Great Dividing Range. In the south the range extends westwards from Victoria to the Yorke Peninsula and the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. It has been introduced into many other areas probably because of its reputation for killing snakes. In December 1891, the Western Australian parliament included 'Laughing Jackass' in the schedule of strictly preserved Australian native birds in the Game Bill, moved by Horace Sholl, member for North District. He described it as native of the North West.The Daily News, Perth, 22 December 1891, page 3, Legislative Assembly His nomination is, therefore, certainly a reference to the blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), not the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae). The Game Act, 1892 (Western Australia), \\"An Act to provide for the preservation of imported birds and animals, and of native game,\\" provided that proclaimed Australian native birds and animals listed in the First Schedule of the Act could be declared protected from taking. Laughing Jackass was one of 23 Australian native bird species named in the schedule. Laughing kookaburras from Eastern States were released near Mullewa in around 1896 and over the following decade hundreds of birds were imported from Victoria and released around Perth. By 1912 breeding populations had been established in a number of areas. The present range in Western Australia is southwest of a line joining Geraldton on the west coast and Hopetoun on the south coast. In Tasmania the laughing kookaburra was introduced at several locations beginning in 1906. It now mainly occurs northeast of a line joining Huonville, Lake Rowallan, Waratah and Marrawah. It was introduced on Flinders Island in around 1940, where it is now widespread, and on Kangaroo Island in 1926. In the 1860s, during his second term as governor of New Zealand, George Grey arranged for the release of laughing kookaburras on Kawau Island. The island lies in the Hauraki Gulf, about north of Auckland on the North Island of New Zealand. It was thought that the introduction had been unsuccessful but in 1916 some birds were discovered on the adjacent mainland. It now breeds in a small region on the western side of the Hauraki Gulf between Leigh and Kumeu. The usual habitat is open sclerophyll forest and woodland. It is more common where the understory is open and sparse or where the ground is covered with grass. Tree-holes are needed for nesting. It also occurs near wetlands and in partly cleared areas or farmland with trees along roads and fences. In urban areas it is found in parks and gardens. The range of the laughing kookaburra overlaps with that of the blue-winged kookaburra in an area of eastern Queensland that extends from the Cape York Peninsula south to near Brisbane. Around Cooktown the laughing kookaburra tends to favour areas near water while the blue-winged kookaburra keeps to drier habitats. Behaviour Kookaburra with a captured gecko in its beak Kookaburras occupy woodland territories (including forests) in loose family groups, and their laughter serves the same purpose as a great many other bird calls‚Äîto mark territorial borders. Most species of kookaburras tend to live in family units, with offspring helping the parents hunt and care for the next generation of offspring. =Breeding= Juvenile in Sydney: Juveniles have shorter bills with a dark underside, and a strong white on the wing and mantle feathers During mating season, the laughing kookaburra reputedly indulges in behaviour similar to that of a wattlebird. The female adopts a begging posture and vocalises like a young bird. The male then offers her his current catch accompanied with an \\"oo oo oo\\" sound. However, some observers maintain that the opposite happens - the female approaches the male with her current catch and offers it to him. Nest-building may start in August with a peak of egg-laying from September to November. If the first clutch fails, they will continue breeding into the summer months. The female generally lays a clutch of three semi-glossy, white, rounded eggs, measuring , at about two-day intervals. Both parents and auxiliaries incubate the eggs for 24-26 days. Hatchlings are and , fledging by day 32-40. If the food supply is not adequate, the third egg will be smaller and the third chick will also be smaller and at a disadvantage relative to its larger siblings. Chicks have a hook on the upper mandible, which disappears by the time of fledging. If the food supply to the chicks is not adequate, the chicks will quarrel, with the hook being used as a weapon. The smallest chick may even be killed by its larger siblings. If food is plentiful, the parent birds spend more time brooding the chicks, so the chicks are not able to fight. =Feeding= Catching a worm, Bruny Island, Tasmania, Australia Kookaburras hunt much as other kingfishers (or indeed Australasian robins) do, by perching on a convenient branch or wire and waiting patiently for prey to pass by. Common prey include mice and similar-sized small mammals, a large variety of invertebrates (such as insects, earthworms and snails), yabbies, small fish, lizards, frogs, small birds and nestlings, and most famously, snakes. Small prey are preferred, but kookaburras sometimes take large creatures, including venomous snakes, much longer than their bodies. Relationship with humans Laughing kookaburras are a common sight in suburban gardens and urban settings, even in built-up areas, and are so tame that they will often eat out of a person's hands. It is not uncommon for kookaburras to snatch food out of people's hands without warning, by swooping in from a distance. People often feed them pieces of raw meat. Laughing kookaburras are often kept in zoos. The kookaburra is also the subject of a popular Australian children's song, the \\"Kookaburra\\" which was written by Marion Sinclair in 1934. Recordings of this bird have been edited into Hollywood movies for decades, usually in jungle settings, beginning with the Tarzan series in the 1930s, and more recently in the film The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Conservation status The population density of the laughing kookaburra in Australia varies between 0.04 and 0.8 birds/ha depending on the habitat. Assuming an average of 0.3 birds/ha the total population may be as large as 65 million individuals. However, this may represent a severe over-estimate since the population of the laughing kookaburra seems to be undergoing a marked decline with Birdata showing a 50% drop in sightings from 2000 to 2019, and a drop in the reporting rate from 25% to 15% over the same period. The population in New Zealand is relatively small and is probably less than 500 individuals. Given the extended range and the large stable population, the species is evaluated as of \\"least concern\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Measuring around , it is slightly smaller than the more familiar laughing kookaburra. It has cream- coloured upper- and underparts barred with brownish markings. It has blue wings and brown shoulders and blue rump. It is sexually dimorphic, with a blue tail in the male, and a rufous tail with blackish bars in the female. Taxonomy Blue Winged kookaburra - Berry Springs - Northern Territory - AustraliaThe blue-winged kookaburra was first collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, but was initially overlooked and confused with the laughing kookaburra, and was finally officially described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1826, its specific name commemorating the British zoologist William Elford Leach.Legge, pp. 16-17 It is one of four members of the genus Dacelo which are commonly known as kookaburras. Alternative common names include barking or howling jackass, or Leach's kookaburra. The number of subspecies is unclear - with four recognised by most authorities, although others have proposed the three Australian subspecies gradually change across Australia and should be treated as one.Legge, p. 22 *D. leachii leachii is the nominate subspecies, found from Brisbane to Broome. *D. leachii cervina is found on Melville Island and the adjacent mainland. *D. leachii cliftoni is found in the Pilbara and Hamersley regions of northwestern Australia. *D. leachii intermedia is found in southern New Guinea. Description The adult blue-winged kookaburra measures around in length and weighs 260 to 330 g. Compared to the related laughing kookaburra, it is smaller, lacks a dark mask, has more blue in the wing, and striking white eye. It has a heavier bill than its larger relative. The head and underparts are cream-coloured with brownish streaks. It is sexually dimorphic, with a blue tail in the male, and a rufous tail with blackish bars in the female. Immature birds have more prominent brown bars and marks in their plumage, giving a 'dirty' appearance, and their eyes are predominantly brown for the first two years of life.Legge, p. 37 The call has been described as a maniacal cackling or barking. Distribution and habitat The blue-winged kookaburra has a distribution from southern New Guinea and the moister parts of northern Australia, to the vicinity of Brisbane in southern Queensland across the Top End, and as far down the Western Australian coast as the Shark Bay area. However, it does not occur between Broome and Port Hedland in northwestern Australia. Widespread and common throughout its large range, the blue-winged kookaburra is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Found in family groups of up to 12 individuals, it lives in open savannah woodland and Melaleuca swamps, as well as farmlands such as sugar cane plantations. Feeding The blue-winged kookaburra hunts and eats a great variety of animals that live on or close to the ground.Legge, p. 42 In the summer wet season, insects, lizards and frogs make up a higher proportion of their diet, while they eat arthropods such as crayfish, scorpions, and spiders, as well as fish, earthworms, small birds and rodents at other times. They have even been recorded waiting for and snatching insects flushed out by bushfires.Legge, p. 44 Breeding The blue-winged kookaburra is a cooperative breeder, a group being made up of a breeding pair and one or more helper birds who help raise the young.Legge, p. 49 Breeding occurs once a year in late spring (September to December). The nest is a hollow high up in a tree, often or so above the ground. Three or four white slightly shiny eggs, measuring or a little larger, are laid. The female incubates the eggs for around 26 days, and nestlings spend another 36 days in the nest before fledging. Chicks are born pink, blind and naked (i.e. ), and break their way out of the egg with an egg tooth on the bill. Feathers appear by seven days and their eyes open from the tenth day onwards.Legge, p. 64 Kookaburra hatchlings are often highly aggressive in the first week of life, and the youngest chick is often killed by the older chicks during this period.Legge, pp. 92-95 Once fledged, juvenile birds need to be taught how to hunt by their parents for a further 6‚Äì10 weeks before they can properly fend for themselves.Legge, p. 59 Threats The red goshawk and rufous owl prey upon the blue-winged kookaburra. Adult birds are also slow flyers and vulnerable to being hit by cars on country roads.Legge, p. 109 Nests are susceptible to raids by olive pythons, quolls, and goannas.

Growing to , it is a vigorous, deciduous woody vine, notable for its showy trumpet-shaped flowers. It inhabits woodlands and riverbanks, and is also a popular garden subject. Typical leaf Description The leaves are opposite, ovate, pinnate, long, and emerald green when new, maturing into a dark green. The flowers come in terminal cymes of 4‚Äì12, orange to red in color with a yellowish throat, and generally appear after several months of warm weather. Pollen under microscope Distribution Campsis radicans is native to the eastern United States and extreme southern Ontario. It is naturalized in parts of the western United States as well as in Ontario and southern Quebec, parts of Europe, and scattered locations in Latin America.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesBiota of North America Program, 2013 county distribution map Ecology The flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds, and many types of birds like to nest in the dense foliage. The flowers are followed by large seed pods. As these mature, they dry and split. Hundreds of thin, brown, paper-like seeds are released. These are easily grown when stratified. Etymology The Latin specific epithet radicans means \\"with stems that take root\\". Garden history The flamboyant flowering of Campsis radicans made it obvious to even the least botanically- minded of the first English colonists in Virginia. Consequently, the plant quickly made its way to England early in the 17th century. Its botanical parentage, as a hardy member of a mostly subtropical group, made its naming problematic: according to John Parkinson, the Virginia settlers were at first calling it a jasmine or a honeysuckle, and then a bellflower; he classed it in the genus Apocynum (dogbane). Joseph Pitton de Tournefort erected a catch-all genus Bignonia in 1700, from which it has since been extricated.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Campsis\\". Cultivation The trumpet vine grows vigorously. In warm weather, it puts out huge numbers of tendrils that grab onto every available surface, and eventually expand into heavy woody stems several centimeters in diameter. It grows well on arbors, fences, telephone poles, and trees, although it may dismember them in the process. Ruthless pruning is recommended. Outside of its native range this species has the potential to be highly invasive, even as far north as New England. The trumpet vine thrives in many places in southern Canada as well. Away from summer heat, C. radicans is less profuse of flower. A larger-flowered hybrid 'Mme Galen' was introduced about 1889 by the Tagliabue nurserymen of Lainate near Milan. The form C. radicans f. flava has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She was a sister of President of the United States John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. Kennedy was presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace in 1938. In her early young adult years, Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, Kennedy's father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for Kennedy in 1941 when she was 23 years of age. The procedure left Kennedy permanently incapacitated and rendering her unable to speak intelligibly. Kennedy spent most of the rest of her life being cared for at St. Coletta, an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The truth about her situation and whereabouts was kept secret for decades. While she was initially isolated from her relatives following her lobotomy, Kennedy visited with her family during her later life. Family and early life The Kennedy family at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, in 1931 with Rosemary on the far right. Rose Marie Kennedy was born at her parents' home in Brookline, Massachusetts. She was the third child and first daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald. She was named after her mother and was commonly called Rosemary or Rosie. During her birth, the doctor was not immediately available and the nurse ordered Rose Kennedy to keep her legs closed, forcing the baby's head to stay in the birth canal for two hours. The action resulted in a harmful loss of oxygen. As Rosemary began to grow, her parents noticed she was not reaching the basic development steps an infant or a toddler normally reaches at a certain month or year. At two years old, she had a hard time sitting up, crawling, and learning to walk. Accounts of Rosemary's life indicated that she was intellectually disabled, although some have raised questions about the Kennedys' accounts of the nature and scope of her disability. A biographer wrote that Rose Kennedy did not confide in her friends and that she pretended her daughter was developing typically, with relatives other than the immediate family knowing nothing of Rosemary's reported low IQ.Leamer, p. 166. Despite the help of tutors, Rosemary had trouble learning to read and write. At age 11, she was sent to a Pennsylvania boarding school for the intellectually disabled. At age 15, Rosemary was sent to the Sacred Heart Convent in Elmhurst, Providence, Rhode Island, where she was educated separately from the other students. Two nuns and a special teacher, Miss Newton, worked with her all day in a separate classroom. The Kennedys gave the school a new tennis court for their efforts. Her reading, writing, spelling, and counting skills were reported to be at a fourth-grade level. During this period, her mother arranged for her older brother John to accompany her to a tea-dance. Thanks to him, she appeared \\"not different at all\\" during the dance.Leamer, pp. 203-204. Rosemary read few books but could read Winnie-the-Pooh.Leamer, p. 304. Diaries written by her in the late 1930s, and published in the 1980s, reveal a young woman whose life was filled with outings to the opera, tea dances, dress fittings, and other social interests.Gibson, Rose Kennedy and Her Family, includes Rosemary's diaries from 1936‚Äì1938. Kennedy accompanied her family to the coronation of Pope Pius XII in Rome in 1939. She also visited the White House. Kennedy's parents told Woman's Day that she was \\"studying to be a kindergarten teacher,\\" and Parents was told that while she had \\"an interest in social welfare work, she is said to harbor a secret longing to go on the stage.\\" When The Boston Globe requested an interview with Rosemary, her father's assistant prepared a response which Rosemary copied out laboriously: > I have always had serious tastes and understand life is not given us just > for enjoyment. For some time past, I have been studying the well known > psychological method of Dr. Maria Montessori and I got my degree in teaching > last year.Leamer, p. 271. In 1938, Kennedy was presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace during her father's service as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Kennedy practiced the complicated royal curtsy for hours. At the event, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, and the King and the Queen smiled as if nothing had happened.Leamer, pp. 251-56. Lobotomy According to Eunice Kennedy Shriver, when Rosemary returned to the United States from the United Kingdom in 1940, she regressed; Shriver later stated that Rosemary became \\"'increasingly irritable and difficult'\\" at age 22. Rosemary would often experience convulsions and fly into violent rages in which she would hit and injure others during this period. After being expelled from a summer camp in western Massachusetts and staying only a few months at a Philadelphia boarding school, Rosemary was sent to a convent school in Washington, D.C. Rosemary began sneaking out of the convent school at night.Leamer, Laurence, The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family, referenced in Associated Press article, Retarded Kennedy Sister Dies at 86, (Saturday, January 8, 2005 The nuns at the convent thought that Rosemary might be involved with men, and that she could contract a sexually transmitted disease or become pregnant. Her occasionally erratic behavior frustrated her parents; her father was especially worried that Rosemary's behavior would shame and embarrass the family and damage his and his children's political careers. When Rosemary was 23 years of age, doctors told her father that a form of psychosurgery known as a lobotomy would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts. Joseph Kennedy decided that Rosemary should have a lobotomy; however, he did not inform his wife of this decision until after the procedure was completed.Morris, Sylvia Jukes, \\"The Saddest Story Ever Told\\", The Wall Street Journal, October 2, 2015. Retrieved 2015-10-03. The procedure took place in November 1941. James W. Watts, who carried out the procedure with Walter Freeman (both of George Washington University School of Medicine), described the procedure to author Ronald Kessler as follows: Dr. Watts told Kessler that in his opinion, Rosemary had suffered not from mental retardation but rather from a form of depression. A review of all of the papers written by the two doctors confirmed Dr. Watts' declaration. All of the patients the two doctors lobotomized were diagnosed as having some form of mental disorder.Kessler, Ronald, The Sins of the Father, Warner Books, 1996, p. 244. It quickly became apparent that the procedure had not been successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two- year-old child. She could not walk or speak intelligibly and was incontinent. =Aftermath= After the lobotomy, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized. She initially lived for several years at Craig House, a private psychiatric hospital an hour and thirty minutes north of New York City.Leamer, p. 322. In 1949, she was relocated to Jefferson, Wisconsin, where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as \\"St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth\\").Leamer, p. 412, and caption to photo of the house facing p. 650. Archbishop Richard Cushing had told her father about St. Coletta's, an institution for more than three hundred people with disabilities, and her father traveled to and built a private house for her about a mile outside St. Coletta's main campus near Alverno House, which was designed for adults who needed lifelong care.Leamer, p. 412. The nuns called the house \\"the Kennedy cottage\\".Leamer, pp. 412, 680. Two Catholic nuns, Sister Margaret Ann and Sister Leona, provided her care along with a student and a woman who worked on ceramics with Rosemary three nights a week.Leamer, p. 760. Rosemary had a car that could be used to take her for rides and a dog which she could take on walks. In response to her condition, Rosemary's parents separated her from her family. Rose Kennedy did not visit her for 20 years. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. did not visit his daughter at the institution. In Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter, author Kate Clifford Larson stated that Rosemary's lobotomy was hidden from the family for twenty years. While her older brother John was campaigning for re-election for the Senate in 1958, the Kennedy family explained away her absence by claiming she was reclusive. The Kennedy family did not publicly explain her absence until 1961, after John had been elected President. The Kennedys did not reveal that she was institutionalized because of a failed lobotomy, but instead said that she was deemed \\"mentally retarded\\".Kessler, p. 233 In 1961, after Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak, Rosemary's siblings were made aware of her location. Her lobotomy did not become public knowledge until 1987. Later life Following Rosemary's father's death in 1969, the Kennedys gradually involved Rosemary in family life again. Rosemary was occasionally taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., and to her childhood home on Cape Cod. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again, but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly, and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told The New York Times in 1995 that this was not entirely the case. Rosemary Kennedy died from natural causes on January 7, 2005, at the age of 86. Kennedy died at the Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin with her siblings (sisters Jean, Eunice, and Patricia and brother Ted) by her side. She was buried beside her parents in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts. See also *Kennedy family *Kennedy family tree References Further reading *Burns, James MacGregor.

A Black Mass is a ceremony typically celebrated by various satanic groups. It has existed for centuries in different forms and is directly based on a Catholic Mass. However, a Black Mass takes the Catholic Mass and inverts it, intentionally mocking the Catholic celebration. Participants often use a consecrated Eucharistic host and desecrate it, using it in obscene ways. This is one of the reasons why tabernacles in Catholic churches have locks and why some parishes have an usher stand next to a communion line. Both policies aim at protecting the Eucharist from being used in a Black Mass. In the 19th century the Black Mass became popularized in French literature, in books such as Satanism and Witchcraft, by Jules Michelet, and L√†-bas, by Joris-Karl Huysmans. Modern revivals began with H. T. F. Rhodes' book, The Satanic Mass published in London in 1954, and there is now a range of modern versions of the Black Mass performed by various groups.  Origins and history of the Black Mass  = Early Catholicism = The Catholic Church regards the Mass as its most important ritual, going back to apostolic times. In general, its various liturgies followed the outline of Liturgy of the Word, Offertory, Liturgy of the Eucharist, and Benediction, which developed into what is known as the Mass. However, as early Christianity became more established and its influence began to spread, the early Church Fathers began to describe a few heretical groups practicing their own versions of Masses. Some of these rituals were of a sexual nature.Zacharias discusses some of these in the first part of his book. The fourth-century AD heresiologist Epiphanius of Salamis, for instance, claims that a libertine Gnostic sect known as the Borborites engaged in a version of the Eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively. He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual. = Medieval Roman Catholic parodies and additions to the Mass = Sixteenth century woodcut depicting black mass. Within the Church, the rite of the Mass was not completely fixed, and there were places at the end of the Offertory for the Secret prayers, when the priest could insert private prayers for various personal needs. These practices became especially prevalent in France (see Pre-Tridentine Mass). As these types of personal prayers within the Mass spread, the institution of the Low Mass became quite common, where priests would hire their services out to perform various Masses for the needs of their clients (Votive Masses) ‚Äî such as blessing crops or cattle, achieving success in some enterprise, obtaining love, or even cursing enemies (one way this latter was done was by inserting the enemy's name in a Mass for the dead, accompanied by burying an image of the enemy). In the 12th and 13th centuries there was a great surplus of clerics and monks who might be inclined to perform these Masses, as younger sons were often sent off to religious universities, and after their studies, needed to find a livelihood. Also within the Church, the Mass was sometimes reworked to create light- hearted parodies of it for certain Church festivities. Some of these became accepted practices at times, such as a festive parody of the Mass called \\"The Feast of Asses\\", in which Balaam's ass (from the Old Testament) would begin talking and saying parts of the Mass. A similar parody was the Feast of Fools. Another result of the surplus of (sometimes disillusioned) clerical students was the appearance of the Latin writings of the Goliards and wandering clerics (clerici vagantes). There began to appear more cynical and heretical parodies of the Mass, also written in ecclesiastical Latin, known as \\"drinkers' masses\\" and \\"gamblers' Masses,\\" which lamented the situation of drunk, gambling monks, and instead of calling to \\"Deus\\" (God), called to \\"Bacchus\\" (the God of Wine) and \\"Decius\\" (the god of dice, which were used in gambling). Some of the earliest of these Latin parody works are found in the medieval Latin collection of poetry, Carmina Burana, written around 1230. At the time these wandering clerics were spreading their Latin writings and parodies of the Mass, the Cathars, who also spread their teachings through wandering clerics, were also active. Due to the proximity in time and location of the Goliards, the Cathars, and the witches, all of whom were seen as threatening the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and the Papal Authority in Rome, some historians have postulated that these wandering clerics may have at times offered their services for performing heretical, or \\"black\\" Masses on various occasions.Rose, Elliot, A Razor for a Goat: A Discussion of Certain Problems in the History of Witchcraft and Diabolism, Toronto, 1962. A further source of late Medieval and Early Modern involvement with parodies and alterations of the Mass, were the writings of the European witch-hunt, which saw witches as being agents of the Devil, who were described as inverting the Christian Mass and employing the stolen Host for diabolical ends. Witch-hunter's manuals such as the Malleus Maleficarum (1487) and the Compendium Maleficarum (1608) allude to these supposed practices.Summers, Montague, translator, The Malleus Maleficarum of Kramer and Sprenger, 1948. (Originally published in Germany, in Latin, 1487.) The first complete depiction of a blasphemy of the Mass in connection with the witches' sabbath,Discussed in the Appendix on the Black Mass in: Medway, Gareth J. Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism, 2001 was given in Florimond de Raemond's 1597 French work, The Antichrist (written as a Catholic response to the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist). He uses the following description of a witches' meeting as a sign that Satanic practices are prevalent in the world, and a sign that the Antichrist's power is on the rise: = Early modern France = Justine, by the Marquis de Sade. Between the 16th and the 19th centuries, many examples of interest in the Black Mass come from France. * 16th century: Catherine de' Medici, the Queen of France, was said by Jean Bodin to have performed a Black Mass, based on a story in his 1580 book on witchcraft De la d√©monomanie des sorciers. In spite of its lurid details, there is little outside evidence to back up his story. * 17th century: Catherine Monvoisin and the priest √âtienne Guibourg performed \\"Black Masses\\" for Madame de Montespan, the mistress of King Louis XIV of France. Since a criminal investigation ‚Äî L'affaire des poisons (\\"Affair of the Poisons\\") ‚Äî was launched (resulting in the execution of Monvoisin and the imprisonment of Guibourg) many details of their Black Mass have come down to us.Ravaisson, Fran√ßois Archives de la Bastille (Paris, 1866-1884, volumes IV, V, VI, VII) It was a typical Roman Catholic Mass, but modified according to certain formulas (some reminiscent of the Latin Sworn Book of Honorius, or its French version, The Grimoire of Pope Honorius) and featuring the King's mistress (the Marquise de Montespan) as the central altar of worship, lying naked upon the altar with the chalice on her bare stomach, and holding a black candle in each of her outstretched arms. The Host was consecrated on her body, and then used in love potions designed to gain the love of the King (on account of the magical power believed to be in the consecrated Host). From these images of the Guibourg mass, further developments of the Black Mass derived.Geography of Witchcraft by Montague Summers (1927; reprint Kessinger Publishing, 2003) * 18th century: The Marquis de Sade, in many of his writings, places the host and the Mass, monks, priests and the Pope himself (Pope Pius VI in Juliette) in blasphemous sexual settings. * 19th century: Joris-Karl Huysmans wrote the classic novel of French Satanism, L√†-bas (1891). The characters in the novel have long discussions on the history of French Satanism up to their time, and eventually one of them is invited to participate in a Black Mass, the type of which Huysmans claimed was practised in Paris in those years. Although a work of fiction, Huysmans' description of the Black Mass remained influential simply because no other book went into as much detail. However, the actual text which Huysmans' satanic \\"priest\\" recites is nothing more than a long diatribe in French, praising Satan as the god of reason and the opponent of Christianity. In this way, it resembles the French poetry of Charles Baudelaire (in particular Les Litanies de Satan), more than it resembles an inversion of the Roman Catholic Mass. = Late 19th century and early 20th century scholarly interest in the Black Mass = Scholarly studies on the Black Mass relied almost completely on French and Latin sources (which also came from France): * The French historian Jules Michelet was one of the first to analyze and attempt to understand the Black Mass, and wrote two chapters about it in his classic book, Satanism and Witchcraft (1862). * J. G. Frazer included a description of the Mass of Saint-S√©caire, an unusual French legend with similarities to the Black Mass, in The Golden Bough (1890). Frazer was recounting material already found in an 1883 French book entitled Quatorze superstitions populaires de la GascogneBlad√©, Jean-Fran√ßois. Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne, 1883. (\\"Fourteen Popular Superstitions of Gascony\\"), by Jean-Fran√ßois Blad√©. This Mass was said to be employed as a method of assassination by supernatural means, allowing the supplicant to avenge himself if he was wronged by someone. * Montague Summers discussed many classic portrayals of the Black Mass in a number of his works (especially in The History of Witchcraft and Demonology (1926), ch. IV, The Sabbat, with extensive quotations from the original French and Latin sourcesSummers, Montague, The History of Witchcraft, 1926, ch. IV, The Sabbat). = 20th century = * H. T. F. Rhodes' popular book, The Satanic Mass,Rhodes, H.T.F. The Satanic Mass, Rider & Company, London, 1954, Citadel Press, USA, 1955. published in London in 1954 (American edition in 1955), was a major inspiration for modern versions of the Black Mass, when they finally appeared. Rhodes claimed that, at the time of his writing, there did not exist a single first hand source which actually described the rites and ceremonies of a Black Mass. * Gerhard ZachariasZacharias, Gerhard. Der dunkle Gott: Satanskult und Schwarze Messe, M√ºnchen, 1964. and Richard Cavendish,Cavendish, Richard. The Black Arts, 1967. both writing in the middle of the 1960s, while presenting detailed studies of source material, offer no new sources for a Black Mass, relying solely on material that was already known to Rhodes. * When Anton Szandor LaVey published his Satanic Bible in 1969, he wrote that: > The usual assumption is that the Satanic ceremony or service is always > called a Black Mass. A Black Mass is not the magical ceremony practiced by > Satanists. The Satanist would only employ the use of a Black Mass as a form > of psychodrama. Furthermore, a Black Mass does not necessarily imply that > the performers of such are Satanists. A Black Mass is essentially a parody > on the religious service of the Roman Catholic Church, but can be loosely > applied to a satire on any religious ceremony.LaVey, Anton. The Satanic > Bible, 1969. He went on in the Satanic Rituals (1972) to present it as the most representatively satanic ritual in the book.\\"The Original Psychodrama ‚Äî Le Messe Noir\\", in LaVey, Anton. The Satanic Rituals, 1972. = 21st century = * In 2014 the Black Mass was held in public at the Oklahoma City Civic Center by the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu. The event saw backlash in the form of protesters such as John Ritchie, the Director of TFP Student Action. The event was also condemned by Archbishop Paul Coakley in a public statement. * The Dakhma of Angra Mainyu held another Black Mass in 2016 at the same location.  The Modern Black Mass  In spite of the huge amount of French literature discussing the Black Mass (Messe Noire) at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, no set of written instructions for performing one, from any purported group of Satanists, turned up in writing until the 1960s, and appeared not in France, but in the United States. As can be seen from these first Black Masses and Satanic Masses appearing in the U.S., the creators drew heavily from occult novelists such as Dennis Wheatley and Joris-Karl Huysmans, and from non-fiction occult writers popular in the 1960s, such as Grillot de Givry, author of the popular illustrated book Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy, and H. T. F. Rhodes, who provided a title for the satanic ritual in his 1954 book The Satanic Mass.Note that throughout his book, Rhodes uses the term \\"Black Mass\\", and not \\"Satanic Mass\\". \\"The Satanic Mass\\" only appears as the title and nowhere else, perhaps because it is a less ambiguous and more suitable book title. Herbert Sloane, the founder of an early Satanist group, the Ophite Cultus Satanas, speaks of Satanists performing the ritual of the \\"Satanic Mass\\" in a letter he wrote in 1968 (see the article on his group), and in 1968 and 1969 also appeared the first two recordings of Satanic rituals, both entitled the \\"Satanic Mass\\": * The first was a 13-minute recording of a full-length \\"Satanic Mass\\" made by the U.S. band Coven. Coven's Satanic Mass, part of their stage show beginning in 1967, was expanded and included on their 1969 record album Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls,Coven, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, LP (Dunwich Productions/Mercury Records, 1969) together with the full published text. On the album cover, it is stated that they spent a long time researching the material, and to their knowledge it was the first Black Mass published in any language. The result was eclectic, drawing chants and material from numerous sources, including two medieval French miracle plays, Le Miracle de Th√©ophile and Jeu de Saint Nicolas, which both contain invocations to the Devil in an unknown language.discussed in: Grillot de Givry, Witchcraft, magic & alchemy, Courier Dover Publications, 1971, p. 109. These chants, along with other material on the album, could be found in books on witchcraft popular in the 60s, notably Grillot de Givry's Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy (originally published in France in 1929).English translation: Grillot de Givry, Witchcraft, magic & alchemy, Courier Dover Publications, 1971. A large portion of the English dialogue was taken verbatim from Dennis Wheatley's 1960 occult novel, The Satanist, in which the female protagonist is initiated into a Satanic cult. Additionally, the recording, while using a couple of the Latin phrases the Church of Satan was already making popular, also added a substantial amount of church Latin, in the form of Gregorian chants sung by the band, to create the genuine effect of the Catholic Latin Mass being inverted and sung to Satan. * The second was a record album of readings in Satanic ritual and philosophy by the Church of Satan, called \\"The Satanic Mass\\",LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Mass, LP (Murgenstrumm Records, 1968) which contained material later to appear in their Satanic Bible (published in 1969). In spite of the title and a few phrases in Latin, this album did not deal with the traditional Black Mass. Soon after Coven created their Satanic Mass recording, the Church of Satan began creating their own Black Masses, two of which are available to the public. The first, created for the Church of Satan by Wayne West in 1970, was entitled \\"Missa Solemnis\\" (named after the Missa Solemnis version of the Latin Mass; originally published only in pamphlet form, later published in Michael Aquino's history of The Church of Satan, Appendix 7.), and the second, created by an unknown author, was entitled \\"Le Messe Noir\\" (published in Anton LaVey's 1972 book The Satanic Rituals). All three of these newly created Black Masses (the one by Coven and the two by the Church of Satan) contain the Latin phrase \\"In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi\\" This phrase undoubtedly is related to almost exactly the same phrase appearing 30 years earlier in an inversion of the Latin Mass (a \\"Luciferian Mass\\") led by a former Catholic priest in Paris, which included the phrase \\"In nomine Domini Dei nostri Satanae Luciferi Excelsi\\". It was published as Messe Lucif√©rienne, in Pierre Geyraud, Les Petites √âglises de Paris, 1937 (Source here: Messe Lucif√©rienne). (In the name of our God, Satan Lucifer of the Most High), as well as the phrases \\"Rege Satanas\\" and \\"Ave Satanas\\" (which, incidentally, are also the only three Latin phrases which appeared in the Church of Satan's 1968 recording, \\"The Satanic Mass\\"). Additionally, all three modify other Latin parts of the Roman Catholic Missal to make them into Satanic versions. The Church of Satan's two Black Masses also use the French text of the Black Mass in Huysmans' L√†-Bas to a great extent. (West only uses the English translation, LaVey publishes also the original French). Thus, the Black Mass found in The Satanic Rituals is a combination of English, French, and Latin. Further, in keeping with the traditional description of the Black Mass, all three also require a consecrated Host taken from a Catholic church, as a central part of the ceremony. A writer using the pseudonym \\"Aubrey Melech\\" published, in 1986, a Black Mass entirely in Latin, entitled \\"Missa Niger\\". (This Black Mass is available on the Internet). Aubrey Melech's Black Mass contains almost exactly the same original Latin phrases as the Black Mass published by LaVey in The Satanic Rituals. The difference is that the amount of Latin has now more than doubled, so that the entire Black Mass is in Latin. Unlike Coven and Wayne West, LaVey and Melech don't give the source for the Latin material in their Black Mass, merely implying that they received it from someone else, without saying who. = The language of the Black Mass = The French sections that LaVey published were quotations from Huysmans's L√†-bas. The Latin of Melech and LaVey is based on the Roman Catholic Latin Missal, reworded so as to give it a Satanic meaning (e.g. the Roman Mass starts \\"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, introibo ad altare Dei\\", while LaVey's version, printed in the Satanic Rituals, starts \\"In nomine magni dei nostri Satanas, introibo ad altare Domini Inferi\\"). There is a small amount of copyist and grammatical errors. For example, \\"dignum\\" from the Mass, is once incorrectly spelled \\"clignum\\", in the printed Satanic Rituals. Another example, also appearing once, is \\"laefificat\\" instead of \\"laetificat\\". One of the more obvious grammatical errors is \\"ego vos benedictio\\", \\"I bless you\\", which should have been \\"ego vos benedico\\". Another grammatical peculiarity is that, throughout his version of the Mass, LaVey does not decline the name Satanas, as is typically done in Latin if the endings are used, but uses only the one form of the word regardless of the case.LaVey, Anton. The Satanic Rituals, 1972 Melech uses Satanus. \\"Satanas\\" as a name for Satan appears in some examples of Latin texts popularly associated with satanism and witchcraft, such as the middle age pact with the Devil supposedly written by Urbain Grandier. Both Black Masses end with the Latin expression \\"Ave, Satanas!\\" ‚Äî Meaning either \\"Welcome, Satan!\\", or \\"Hail Satan!\\" (expressing the opposite sentiments of the similar statement made by Jesus to Satan in the Latin Vulgate Bible (Latin Vulgate, Matthew 4:10),Biblia Sacra Vulgata (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, 1994), Matt. 4:10: Tunc dicit ei Iesus, \\"Vade Satanas!

While conventionally assigned to the period 250‚Äì710, including both the Kofun period (‚Äì538) and the Asuka period (538‚Äì710), the actual start of Yamato rule is disputed. The Yamato court's supremacy was challenged during the Kofun period by other polities centered in various parts of Japan. What is certain is that Yamato clans had major advantages over their neighbouring clans in the 6th century. This period is divided into the Kofun and Asuka periods, by the relocation of the capital to Asuka, in modern Nara Prefecture. However, the Kofun period is an archaeological period while the Asuka period is a historical period. Therefore, many think of this as an old division and this concept of period division is no longer popular in Japan. At the era of Prince Sh≈çtoku in the early 7th century, a new constitution was prescribed for Japan based on the Chinese model. After the fall of Baekje (660 AD), the Yamato government sent envoys directly to the Chinese court, from which they obtained a great wealth of philosophical and social structure. In addition to ethics and government, they also adopted the Chinese calendar and many of its religious practices, including Confucianism and Taoism (Japanese: Onmyo).  Background of Yamato society and culture  Yamato, in the 7th century A millennium earlier, the Japanese archipelago had been inhabited by the J≈çmon people. In the centuries prior to the beginning of the Yamato period, elements of the Northeast Asian and Chinese civilizations had been introduced to the Japanese Archipelago in waves of migration. According to Kojiki, the oldest record of Japan, a Korean immigrant named Amenohiboko, prince of Silla came to Japan to serve the Japanese Emperor,Nihon Shoki, Vol.6 \\"Â§©Êó•ÊßçÂ∞çÊõ∞ ÂÉïÊñ∞ÁæÖÂúã‰∏ª‰πãÂ≠ê‰πü ÁÑ∂ËÅûÊó•Êú¨ÂúãÊúâËÅñÁöá Ââá‰ª•Â∑±ÂúãÊéàÂºüÁü•Âè§ËÄåÂåñÊ≠∏(to serve)‰πã\\" and he lived in Tajima Province. His descendant is believed to be Tajimamori.Nihon Shoki, Vol.6 \\"ÊïÖÂ§©Êó•ÊßçÂ®∂‰ΩÜÈ¶¨Âá∫Â∂ã‰∫∫ Â§™ËÄ≥Â•≥È∫ªÂ§öÁÉè Áîü‰ΩÜÈ¶¨Ë´∏Âä©‰πü Ë´∏Âä©Áîü‰ΩÜÈ¶¨Êó•Ê•¢Êùµ Êó•Ê•¢ÊùµÁîüÊ∏ÖÂΩ¶ Ê∏ÖÂΩ¶ÁîüÁî∞ÈÅìÈñìÂÆà‰πü\\" Archaeological evidence indicates contacts between China, Korea, and Japan since prehistory of the Neolithic period, and its continuation also at least in the Kofun period. The rice-growing, politically-fragmented Yayoi culture either evolved into the new Japanese culture characterized by the more centralized, patriarchal, militaristic Kofun period or came to be dominated and eventually overrun by Yamato society. By this time, Japonic had also spread to the Ryukyu Islands such as Okinawa. The Ryukyuan languages and Japanese most likely diverged during this period.Heinrich, Patrick, \\"Language Loss and Revitalization in the Ryukyu Islands,\\" Japan Focus, November 10, 2005; ______, \\"What leaves a mark should no longer stain: Progressive erasure and reversing language shift activities in the Ryukyu Islands,\\" First International Small Island Cultures Conference at Kagoshima University, Centre for the Pacific Islands, February 7‚Äì10, 2005; citing Shiro Hattori.

Kofun period  The is an era in the history of Japan from around 250 to 538. The word kofun is Japanese for the type of burial mounds dating from this era. During the Kofun period, elements of Chinese culture continued to influence culture in the Japanese archipelago, both through waves of migration and through trade, travel, and cultural change. Archaeological evidence indicates contacts between the mainland and Japan also during this period. Most scholars believe that there were massive transmissions of technology and culture from China via Korea to Japan which is evidenced by material artifacts in tombs of both states in the Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms of Korea and Kofun period, as well as the later wave of Baekje refugees to Yamato. Archaeological records and ancient Chinese sources Book of Song indicate that the various tribes and chiefdom of the Japanese Archipelago did not begin to coalesce into more centralized and hierarchical polities until 300 (well into the Kofun period), when large tombs begin to appear while there were no contacts between the Wa and China. Some describe the \\"mysterious century\\" as a time of internecine warfare as various local monarchies competed for hegemony on Ky≈´sh≈´ and Honsh≈´. Japan of the Kofun age was positive in the introduction of Chinese culture. Several kinds of goods were imported. Books from China were one of the most important trade goods. Chinese philosophy that had been introduced in this era, had a big influence on the history of Japan. Decorated bronze mirrors (Shinju-kyo) were imported from China. Japan imported iron from Korean peninsula until the latter half of the 6th century. In this period, Baekje received military support from Japan. According to the Samguk Sagi, King Asin of Baekje sent his son Jeonji to Japan in 397Korean History Record Samguk Sagi : ‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò ÁôæÊ∏àÊú¨Á¥Ä : ÂÖ≠Âπ¥ Â§è‰∫îÊúà ÁéãËàáÂÄ≠ÂúãÁµêÂ•Ω ‰ª•Â§™Â≠êËÖÜÊîØÁà≤Ë≥™ Áßã‰∏ÉÊúà Â§ßÈñ±ÊñºÊº¢Ê∞¥‰πãÂçó and King Silseong of Silla sent his son Misaheun to Japan in 402 in order to solicit military aid.Korean History Record Samguk Sagi : ‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò Êñ∞ÁæÖÊú¨Á¥Ä : ÂÖÉÂπ¥ ‰∏âÊúà ËàáÂÄ≠ÂúãÈÄöÂ•Ω ‰ª•Â•àÂãøÁéãÂ≠êÊú™ÊñØÊ¨£Áà≤Ë≥™ =Kofun tombs= Daisen Kofun, the tomb of Emperor Nintoku, Osaka, 5th century. Kofun (Âè§Â¢≥, \\"old tomb\\") are burial mounds which were built for the people of the ruling class during the 3rd to 7th centuries. The Kofun period takes its name from these distinctive earthen mounds which are associated with the rich funerary rituals of the time. The mounds contained large stone burial chambers. Some are surrounded by moats. Kofun came in many shapes, with round and square being the simplest. A distinct style is the keyhole kofun (ÂâçÊñπÂæåÂÜÜÂ¢≥ zenp≈ç k≈çen fun), with its square front and round back. Many kofuns were natural hills, which might have been sculpted to their final shape. Kofun range in size from several meters to over 400 meters in length. By the late Kofun period, the distinctive burial chambers, originally used by the ruling elite, were also built for commoners. The biggest kofun are believed to be the tombs of emperors like Emperor ≈åjin (ÂøúÁ•ûÂ§©Áöá ≈åjin Tenn≈ç) and Emperor Nintoku (‰ªÅÂæ≥Â§©Áöá Nintoku Tenn≈ç). Kofun are also classified according to whether the entrance to the stone burial chamber is vertical (Á∏¶Á©¥ tate-ana) or horizontal (Ê®™Á©¥ yoko-ana). = Immigrants in early Japan = Japan of the Kofun period was very receptive to influence from China.Imamura (1996) Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing elements of Chinese culture to early Japan.Stearns (2001:56) Yamato links to the mainland and the Liu Song Dynasty in 425 and 478 were facilitated by the maritime knowledge and diplomatic connections of China and the Three Kingdoms of the Korean peninsula, especially Baekje.W.G. Beasley, The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan, University of California Press, 2000. Many important figures were immigrants from East Asia. Yamato Imperial Court officially edited the Shinsen Sh≈çjiroku in 815 as a directory of aristocrats which lists 1182 names of clans which were in Kinai area, it lists a number of clans from the Han China, Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo. According to the directory, 174 clans have roots in China, 120 clans have roots in Baekje, 48 clans have roots in Goguryeo, 17 clans have roots in Silla, then 9 clans have roots in Gaya of the Korean peninsula. =Kofun society= saddle and stirrups, 6th century. The Kofun period was a critical stage in Japan's evolution toward a more cohesive and recognized state. This society was most developed in the Kansai Region and the easternmost part of the Inland Sea. Japan's rulers of the time even petitioned the Chinese court for confirmation of royal titles. The Yamato polity, which emerged by the late 5th century, was distinguished by powerful great clans or extended families, including their dependants. Each clan was headed by a patriarch who performed sacred rites to the clan's kami to ensure the long-term welfare of the clan. Clan members were the aristocracy, and the kingly line that controlled the Yamato court was at its pinnacle. The Kofun period of Japanese culture is also sometimes called the Yamato period by some Western scholars since this local chieftainship arose to become the Imperial dynasty at the end of the Kofun period. Asuka period The is generally defined as from 538‚Äì710. The arrival of Buddhism marked a change in Japanese society and affected the Yamato government. The Yamato state evolved much during the Asuka period, which is named after the Asuka region, south of modern Nara, the site of numerous temporary imperial capitals established during the period. The Asuka period is known for its significant artistic, social, and political transformations, which had their origins in the late Kofun period. Artistically, the term Tori Style is often used for the Asuka period. This is from the sculptor Kuratsukuri Tori, grandson of Chinese immigrant Shiba Tatto. Tori Style inherits Chinese Northern Wei style. The arts during the Asuka and Nara periods are similar to contemporaneous art in China and Korea. One example of this is Tori Busshi's Shaka triad which reflects the style of early to mid-sixth-century Chinese style. = Introduction of Buddhism = MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism officially introduced to Japan in 538. According to Nihon Shoki, was officially introduced to the Yamato court through Baekje in 552, while it is widely recognized Buddhism was introduced in 538 based on the biography of Prince Sh≈çtoku (J≈çg≈´ Sh≈çtoku H≈ç≈ç Teisetsu) and the record of Gang≈ç-ji (Gang≈çji Garan Engi). Initial uptake of Buddhism was slow. Nihon Shoki records that when Emperor Kinmei discussed about the acceptance of this new foreign religion, Soga no Iname expressed his support while Mononobe no Okoshi and Nakatomi no Kamako (later the Fujiwara clan) opposed not on religious grounds, but more so as the results of feelings of nationalism and a degree of xenophobia. With the dawn of the Asuka period, the use of elaborate kofun tombs by the imperial family and other elite fell out of use because of prevailing new Buddhist beliefs, which put greater emphasis on the transience of human life. Commoners and the elite in outlying regions, however, continued to use kofun until the late seventh century, and simpler but distinctive tombs continued in use throughout the following period. Buddhism only started to spread after Mononobe no Moriya lost in the Battle of Shigisan in 587 where the Mononobe clan was defeated and crushed, and Empress Suiko openly encouraged the acceptance of Buddhism among all Japanese people. In 607, in order to obtain copies of Sutras, an imperial embassy was dispatched to Sui Dynasty China.  Yamato state  The evolved still further during the Asuka period, which is named after the Asuka region, south of modern Nara, the site of numerous temporary imperial capitals established during the period. The Asuka period is known for its significant artistic, social, and political transformations, which had their origins in the late Kofun period. The Yamato court, concentrated in the Asuka region, exercised power over clans in Ky≈´sh≈´ and Honsh≈´, bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed the clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they developed a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains but with no permanent capital. By the mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to the central policy. The basic administrative unit of the Gokishichido system was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; others were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers and ritual specialists.

When the concept of armored corps proved unnecessary, II Armored Corps was re-designated as XVIII Corps on 9 October 1943 at the Presidio of Monterey, California. XVIII Corps deployed to Europe on 17 August 1944 and became the XVIII Airborne Corps on 25 August 1944 at Ogbourne St.George, England, assuming command of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, as part of the preparation for Operation Market Garden. Prior to this time the two divisions were assigned to VII Corps and jumped into Normandy during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, as part of VII Corps.http://www.vii-corps.org/WWII/WWII.htm Major General Matthew Bunker Ridgway, a highly professional, competent and experienced airborne commander who had led the 82nd Airborne Division in Sicily, Italy and Normandy, was chosen to command the corps, which then consisted of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and was part of the newly created First Allied Airborne Army. The corps headquarters did not see service in Operation Market Garden, with the British I Airborne Corps being chosen instead to exercise operational command of all Allied airborne forces in the operation, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. Following the Battle of the Bulge, in which the corps played a significant part (and which, during the early stages of the battle, the corps was commanded by Major General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne), all American airborne units on the Western Front fell under command of the corps. XVIII Airborne Corps planned and executed Operation Varsity, the airborne component of Operation Plunder, the crossing of the River Rhine into Germany. It was one of the largest airborne operations of the war, with the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions under command. The U.S. 13th Airborne Division was to participate in the assault. However, due to a lack of a sufficient number of transports, the division was unable to take part. After taking part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, the XVIII Airborne Corps, still under Ridgway, returned to the United States in June 1945 and was initially to take part in the invasion of Japan, codenamed Operation Downfall. However, the Japanese surrendered just weeks later and XVIII Airborne Corps was inactivated on 15 October 1945 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. =World War II units= * 1st Infantry Division ‚Äî 26 January 1945 ‚Äì 12 February 1945. * 4th Infantry Division * 8th Infantry Division ‚Äî 26 January 1945 ‚Äì 10 July 1945. * 17th Airborne Division ‚Äî 12 August 1944 ‚Äì 1 January 1945; 15 February 1945 ‚Äì 24 March 1945. * 29th Infantry Division * 30th Infantry Division ‚Äî 21 December 1944 ‚Äì 3 February 1945. * 34th Infantry Division * 75th Infantry Division ‚Äî 29 December 1944 ‚Äì 2 January 1945; 7 January 1945. * 78th Infantry Division ‚Äî 3 February 1945 ‚Äì 12 February 1945. * 82nd Airborne Division ‚Äî 12 August 1944 ‚Äì 17 September 1944; 19 December 1944 ‚Äì 14 February 1945; 30 April 1945 ‚Äì 3 January 1946. * 84th Infantry Division ‚Äî 20 December 1944 ‚Äì 21 December 1944. * 86th Infantry Division ‚Äî 5 April 1945 ‚Äì 22 April 1945. * 89th Infantry Division * 97th Infantry Division ‚Äî 10 April 1945 ‚Äì 22 April 1945. * 101st Airborne Division ‚Äî 12 August 1944 ‚Äî 21 September 1944; 28 February 1945 ‚Äì 1 April 1945. * 106th Infantry Division ‚Äî 20 December 1944 ‚Äì 6 February 1945. * 3rd Armored Division ‚Äî 19 December 1944 ‚Äì 23 December 1944. * 5th Armored Division ‚Äî 4 May 1945 ‚Äì 10 October 1945. * 7th Armored Division ‚Äî 20 December 1944 ‚Äì 29 January 1945; 30 April 1945 ‚Äì 9 October 1945. * 13th Armored Division ‚Äî 10 April 1945 ‚Äì 22 April 1945. = Cold War = The Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg on 21 May 1951 under the command of Major General John W. Leonard. Since then, the corps has been the primary strategic response force, with subordinate units participating in over a dozen major operations (listed below) in both combat and humanitarian roles, primarily in Central America and the CENTCOM area of responsibility. In 1958 the XVIII Airborne Corps was given the additional mission of becoming the Strategic Army Corps. The corps was now tasked, in addition, to provide a flexible strike capability that could deploy worldwide, on short notice, without declaration of an emergency. The 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, and the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were designated as STRAC's first-line divisions, while the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg were to provide backup in the event of general war. The 5th Logistical Command (later inactivated), also at Fort Bragg, would provide the corps with logistics support, while Fort Bragg's XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery would control artillery units. The Corps deployed forces to the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic ('Operation Power Pack') in 1965. The Corps deployed forces to the Vietnam War, including the entire 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne division. In 1967 elements of the Corps were deployed to Detroit to suppress riots, and also to The Congo to support the government there and to rescue civilian hostages as part of Operation Dragon Rouge. In 1982 the Corps first rotated elements to the Sinai Peninsula as part of the Multinational Force and Observers (UN) to guarantee the Camp David Peace Accords. In 1983 elements of the Corps were deployed to the Island of Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury, with the stated goal of reestablishing the democratically elected government. In 1989 XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by then LTG Carl Stiner, participated in the invasion of Panama in Operation Just Cause. Stiner served concurrently as Commander of Joint Task Force South.  Structure in 1989  At the end of the Cold War in 1989 the corps consisted of the following formations and units: * XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina ** Headquarters & Headquarters Company ** 18th Personnel Group ** 18th Finance Group ** 1st Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery, Fort Stewart ** 10th Mountain Division (Light), Fort Drum, New York ** 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Stewart, Georgia ** 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina ** 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky ** XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery, Fort Bragg *** 18th Field Artillery Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg **** Headquarters & Headquarters Battery **** 3rd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery (24 √ó M198 155mm towed howitzer) **** 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery (24 √ó M198 155mm towed howitzer) **** 3rd Battalion, 27th Field Artillery (27 √ó M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System) **** 1st Battalion, 39th Field Artillery (Airborne) (24 √ó M198 155mm towed howitzer) **** 1st Field Artillery Detachment (Target Acquisition) ** 18th Aviation Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg *** Headquarters & Headquarters Company *** 1st Battalion, 58th Aviation (Air Traffic Control) *** 1st Battalion, 159th Aviation (General Support) *** 2nd Battalion, 159th Aviation (Medium Lift) *** 3rd Battalion, 159th Aviation (Attack) *** 2nd Battalion, 229th Aviation (Attack) (former 2nd Battalion, 101st Aviation) ** 20th Engineer Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg *** 27th Engineer Battalion (Airborne) *** 30th Engineer Battalion (Topographic) *** 37th Engineer Battalion (Airborne) *** 175th Engineer Company *** 264th Engineer Company (Bridge) *** 362nd Engineer Company ** 16th Military Police Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg *** 503rd Military Police Battalion (Airborne) ** 35th Signal Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg *** 25th Signal Battalion (Corps Area) *** 50th Signal Battalion (Corps Command Operations) (Airborne) *** 327th Signal Battalion (Corps Radio) *** 426th Signal Battalion (Corps Area) ** 525th Military Intelligence Brigade (Airborne), Fort Bragg *** 224th Military Intelligence Battalion (Aerial Exploitation), Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia *** 319th Military Intelligence Battalion (Operations) *** 519th Military Intelligence Battalion (Tactical Exploitation) (Airborne) ** 1st Corps Support Command (Airborne), Fort Bragg ***subordination formations and units = Desert Storm = In 1991, XVIII Airborne Corps participated in the Persian Gulf War. The corps was responsible for securing VII Corps' northern flank against a possible Iraqi counterattack. Along with the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, 24th Infantry Division and 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, XVIII Airborne Corps also gained operational control of the French 6th Light Armor Division (LAD) (which also included units from the French Foreign Legion). During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery consisted of the 3d Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; and the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 39th Field Artillery. The living quarters for these three units were situated between the 82d Airborne Division and the Special Forces at Fort Bragg. Of the three units, only 1-39th was airborne qualified and served as the only fully airborne deployable 155 mm Field Artillery unit in history. The 1-39th FA and 3-8th FA were key components of the thrust into Iraq in the first Gulf War, providing fire support for the French Foreign Legion and the 82nd Airborne Division. The 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery also served in a major support role for 82d and French troops during the Gulf War. It consisted of three individual batteries. Batteries A and B were Airborne-qualified, while Battery C was air assault. Batteries A and B were assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Battery C was assigned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. All of the battalions were subsequently re-flagged during the years following the Gulf War. Task Force 118 had flown the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior off naval vessels during Operation Prime Chance in the 1980s, operating against Iran in the Persian Gulf. It was redesignated the 4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry on 15 January 1991. During the Gulf War of 1991 it was part of the 18th Aviation Brigade. Major formations, 1950‚Äì2006 The 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions have served with the corps since the 1950s. The 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was 'reflagged' as the 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized) in April 1996. * 7th Infantry Division (Light) * 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) * XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery ** 18th Field Artillery Brigade * 1st Sustainment Command (Theater) * 35th Signal Brigade * 18th Aviation Brigade (no longer active) * 20th Engineer Brigade * 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade * 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade * 16th Military Police Brigade * 44th Medical Command * additional smaller, National Guard, and Reserve units =21st century= thumbleft The XVIII Airborne Corps command group, led by LTG (later GEN) Lloyd J. Austin, returns home from Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2009 The Corps headquarters was deployed to Afghanistan from May 2002 ‚Äì 2003, and became Combined Joint Task Force 180 for the deployment. XVIII Airborne Corps was most recently deployed, from January 2005 to January 2006, to Baghdad, Iraq, where it served as the Multi-National Corps ‚Äì Iraq. Following its return, XVIII Airborne Corps and its subordinate units began the process of modernization and reorganization. Under the previous Army Chief of Staff's future restructure of the Army, the corps headquarters of the XVIII Airborne Corps will lose its airborne (specifically parachute) certification as a cost- cutting measure‚Äîthe same will occur to the divisional headquarters of the 82nd Airborne Division. This plan is designed to follow the U.S. Army's restructuring plan to go from being division-based to brigade-based. This will mean that the largest units that will be airborne ‚Äì specifically parachute certified ‚Äì will be at the brigade level. Even so, for traditional and historical reasons, the formation will continue to be called the XVIII Airborne Corps. The divisions that fall under the XVIII Airborne Corps (as well as the other two corps in the Army) are in a period of transition, shifting from corps control to fall directly under FORSCOM, eliminating the corps status as a middle man. This ties in with the Army's broad modularity plan, as a corps can deploy and support any unit, not just the units subordinate to the corps. The 3d Infantry Division, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), and the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) have already changed over to direct FORSCOM control. The 82nd Airborne Division will transfer after the division returns from Afghanistan. In August 2006, XVIII Airborne Corps traveled to South Korea to participate in Ulchi Focus Lens, a joint training exercise between the Republic of Korea Army and coalition forces stationed there. In mid-April, 2007, the Department of the Army confirmed the next OIF deployment schedule, with XVIII Airborne Corps deploying to relieve III Corps as the MNC-I at Camp Victory, Baghdad, Iraq. XVIII Airborne Corps is scheduled to replace III Corps in November, 2007. The corps will deploy along with 1st Armored Division and 4th Infantry Division, as well as 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and 1st BCT, 82nd Airborne Division. On 21 December 2016, Stars and Stripes reported that in August the XVIII Airborne Corps deployed to Iraq for Operation Inherent Resolve, in December this included the XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters and the 1st Special Forces Command, which is deployed as the Special Operations Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve. The 18th Field Artillery Brigade deployed into Iraq with High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. A Canadian Army General has served with the XVIII Corps since 2007.https://www.fayobserver.com/news/20180529/canadian-general-ending-two- year-tour-at-fort-bragg Current structure Order of Battle of the XVIII Airborne Corps (click to enlarge) 30px XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg * 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart * 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum * 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg * 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell * 18th Field Artillery Brigade, Fort Bragg * 20th Engineer Brigade, Fort Bragg Other major units stationed along the XVIII Corps units are: * 16th Military Police Brigade, Fort Bragg * 3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), Fort Bragg * 7th Transportation Brigade, Fort Eustis * 20th Support Command (CBRNE), Aberdeen Proving Grounds, part of United States Army Forces Command ** 52nd Ordnance Group (EOD), Fort Campbell * 525th Military Intelligence Brigade, Fort Bragg * 35th Signal Brigade, Fort Gordon * 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, Fort Bragg, part of 32nd Army Air & Missile Defense Command * 18th Air Support Operations Group, Pope Field (United States Air Force unit responsible for coordinating corps tactical air support) * 44th Medical Brigade, Fort Bragg =Operations= The corps has participated in a number of operations since then: * Operation Power Pack ‚Äì Dominican Republic, 1965 * Operation Urgent Fury ‚Äì Grenada, 1983 * Operation Golden Pheasant ‚Äì Honduras, 1988 * Operation Nimrod Dancer ‚Äì Panama, 1989 * Operation Hawkeye ‚Äì U.S. Virgin Islands, 1989 * Operation Just Cause ‚Äì Panama, 1989 * Operation Desert Shield ‚Äì Saudi Arabia, 1990‚Äì1991 * Operation Desert Storm ‚Äì Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, 1991 * Operation GTMO ‚Äì Cuba, 1991 * Operation Hurricane Andrew ‚Äì Florida, 1992 * Operation Restore Hope ‚Äì Somalia, 1992 * Operation Uphold/Maintain Democracy ‚Äì Haiti, 1994 * Operation Vigilant Warrior ‚Äì Kuwait, 1994 * Operation Joint Forge ‚Äì Bosnia, 1998 * Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan, 2002, 2014 * Operation Iraqi Freedom ‚Äì Iraq, 2005 * Operation Iraqi Freedom ‚Äì Iraq, 2008 * Operation Unified Response ‚Äì Haiti, 2010 * Operation New Dawn ‚Äì Iraq, 2011 * Operation Inherent Resolve ‚Äì Iraq and Syria, 2015‚Äì2016 =Notable members= * John D.

Some also provide economic local transport. For rail museums, see List of British railway museums. Many of the standard-gauge railways listed, including former branch lines and ex-mainline routes, were closed by British Railways under the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. Most have been restored and operate as heritage lines. A smaller number of lines were formerly industrial or colliery railways. Many of these preserved railways are mentioned in national and international tour guides, and visits may form part of a school curriculum or feature in other studies, including civil engineering, mechanics, social, economic and political history, visual arts and drama. This list also includes tramways. Nearly all Tram services in Britain ended in the 1950s and early 1960s, leaving just Blackpool Corporation Tramways, although some big cities have since revived them in the late 20th century onwards.

Human vision is unable to distinguish color in conditions of either high brightness or very low brightness. In conditions with insufficient light levels, color perception ranges from achromatic to ultimately black. The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures. Referring to a time of day, complete darkness occurs when the Sun is more than 18¬∞ below the horizon, without the effects of twilight on the night sky. Scientific =Perception= The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception. In perceiving, the eye is active, and the part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage. =Physics= In terms of physics, an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons, causing it to appear dim compared to other objects. For example, matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark, whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright. For more information, see color. An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive. A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness. One scientific measure of darkness is the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, which indicates the night sky's and stars' brightness at a particular location, and the observability of celestial objects at that location. (See also: Sky brightness) The material known as Vantablack is one of the darkest substances known, absorbing up to 99.965% of visible light (at 663 nm if the light is perpendicular to the material) is a material developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the United Kingdom.Guinness World Records: Darkest manmade substance, Guinness World Records 19 October 2015 The name is a compound of the acronym VANTA (vertically aligned nanotube arrays)[6] and the color black. =Technical= The color of a point, on a standard 24-bit computer display, is defined by three RGB (red, green, blue) values, each ranging from 0-255. When the red, green, and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated (255,255,255), the pixel appears white; when all three components are unilluminated (0,0,0), the pixel appears black. Cultural =Artistic= Caravaggio's The Calling of St Matthew uses darkness for its chiaroscuro effects. Artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light. Darkness can be used as a counterpoint to areas of lightness to create leading lines and voids. Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting. Shadows add depth and perspective to a painting. See chiaroscuro for a discussion of the uses of such contrasts in visual media. Color paints are mixed together to create darkness, because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light. Theoretically, mixing together the three primary colors, or the three secondary colors, will absorb all visible light and create black. In practice it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint. =Literature= Separation of light and darkness on the first day of creation, from the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo As a poetic term in the Western world, darkness is used to connote the presence of shadows, evil, and foreboding, or in modern parlance, to connote that a story is grim, heavy, and/or depressing. Religion The first creation narrative in Judaism begins with darkness, into which is introduced the creation of light, and the separation of this light from the darkness (as distinct from the creation of the sun and moon on the fourth day of creation). Thus, although both light and darkness are included in the comprehensive works of the almighty God‚Äîdarkness was considered \\"the second to last plague\\" (Exodus 10:21), and the location of \\"weeping and gnashing of teeth\\" (Matthew 8:12). Erebus was a primordial deity in Greek mythology, representing the personification of darkness. Philosophy In Chinese philosophy, Yin is the complementary feminine part of the Taijitu and is represented by a dark lobe. Poetry The use of darkness as a rhetorical device has a long-standing tradition. Shakespeare, working in the 16th and 17th centuries, made a character called the \\"prince of darkness\\" (King Lear: III, iv) and gave darkness jaws with which to devour love. (A Midsummer Night's Dream: I, i) Chaucer, a 14th-century Middle English writer of The Canterbury Tales, wrote that knights must cast away the \\"workes of darkness\\". In The Divine Comedy, Dante described hell as \\"solid darkness stain'd\\". Language In Old English there were three words that could mean darkness: heolstor, genip, and sceadu. Heolstor also meant \\"hiding-place\\" and became holster. Genip meant \\"mist\\" and fell out of use like many strong verbs. It is however still used in the Dutch saying \\"in het geniep\\" which means secretly. Sceadu meant \\"shadow\\" and remained in use. The word dark eventually evolved from the word deorc.

If is a local homeomorphism, is said to be an √©tale space over Local homeomorphisms are used in the study of sheaves. Typical examples of local homeomorphisms are covering maps. A topological space is locally homeomorphic to if every point of has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of . For example, a manifold of dimension is locally homeomorphic to \\\\mathbb R^n. If there is a local homeomorphism from to , then is locally homeomorphic to , but the converse is not always true. For example, the two dimensional sphere, being a manifold, is locally homeomorphic to the plane \\\\mathbb R^2, but there is no local homeomorphism between them (in either direction).  Formal definition  Let X and Y be topological spaces. A function is a local homeomorphism if for every point x in X there exists an open set U containing x, such that the image is open in Y and the restriction fU : U ‚Üí f(U) is a homeomorphism (where the respective subspace topologies are used on U and on ).  Examples  By definition, every homeomorphism is also a local homeomorphism. If U is an open subset of Y equipped with the subspace topology, then the inclusion map is a local homeomorphism. Openness is essential here: the inclusion map of a non-open subset of Y never yields a local homeomorphism. Let be the map that wraps the real line around the circle (i.e. for all ). This is a local homeomorphism but not a homeomorphism. Let be the map that wraps the circle around itself n times (i.e. has winding number n). This is a local homeomorphism for all non-zero n, but a homeomorphism only in the cases where it is bijective, i.e. when or -1. Generalizing the previous two examples, every covering map is a local homeomorphism; in particular, the universal cover of a space Y is a local homeomorphism. In certain situations the converse is true. For example: if X is Hausdorff and Y is locally compact and Hausdorff and is a proper local homeomorphism, then p is a covering map. There are local homeomorphisms where Y is a Hausdorff space and X is not. Consider for instance the quotient space , where the equivalence relation ~ on the disjoint union of two copies of the reals identifies every negative real of the first copy with the corresponding negative real of the second copy. The two copies of 0 are not identified and they do not have any disjoint neighborhoods, so X is not Hausdorff. One readily checks that the natural map is a local homeomorphism. The fiber has two elements if y ‚â• 0 and one element if y < 0\\\\. Similarly, we can construct a local homeomorphisms where X is Hausdorff and Y is not: pick the natural map from to with the same equivalence relation ~ as above. It is shown in complex analysis that a complex analytic function (where U is an open subset of the complex plane C) is a local homeomorphism precisely when the derivative is non-zero for all . The function on an open disk around 0 is not a local homeomorphism at 0 when n is at least 2. In that case 0 is a point of \\"ramification\\" (intuitively, n sheets come together there). Using the inverse function theorem one can show that a continuously differentiable function (where U is an open subset of ) is a local homeomorphism if the derivative Dxf is an invertible linear map (invertible square matrix) for every . (The converse is false, as shown by the local homeomorphism with .) An analogous condition can be formulated for maps between differentiable manifolds.  Properties  Every local homeomorphism is a continuous and open map. A bijective local homeomorphism is therefore a homeomorphism. A local homeomorphism transfers \\"local\\" topological properties in both directions: * X is locally connected if and only if is; * X is locally path-connected if and only if is; * X is locally compact if and only if is; * X is first-countable if and only if is. As pointed out above, the Hausdorff property is not local in this sense and need not be preserved by local homeomorphisms. If is a local homeomorphism and U is an open subset of X, then the restriction fU is also a local homeomorphism. If and are local homeomorphisms, then the composition is also a local homeomorphism. If is continuous, is a local homeomorphism, and a local homeomorphism, then f is also a local homeomorphism. The local homeomorphisms with codomain Y stand in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the sheaves of sets on Y; this correspondence is in fact an equivalence of categories. Furthermore, every continuous map with codomain Y gives rise to a uniquely defined local homeomorphism with codomain Y in a natural way. All of this is explained in detail in the article on sheaves.  Generalizations and analogous concepts  The idea of a local homeomorphism can be formulated in geometric settings different from that of topological spaces. For differentiable manifolds, we obtain the local diffeomorphisms; for schemes, we have the formally √©tale morphisms and the √©tale morphisms; and for toposes, we get the √©tale geometric morphisms.

In females, an acute rise of LH (\\"LH surge\\") triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell‚Äìstimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  Structure  LH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a glycoprotein molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein. Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits (labeled alpha- and beta- subunits) that are non- covalently associated: * The alpha subunits of LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical, and contain 92 amino acids in human but 96 amino acids in almost all other vertebrate species (glycoprotein hormones do not exist in invertebrates). * The beta subunits vary. LH has a beta subunit of 120 amino acids (LHB) that confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for the specificity of the interaction with the LH receptor. This beta subunit contains an amino acid sequence that exhibits large homologies with that of the beta subunit of hCG and both stimulate the same receptor. However, the hCG beta subunit contains an additional 24 amino acids, and the two hormones differ in the composition of their sugar moieties. The different composition of these oligosaccharides affects bioactivity and speed of degradation. The biologic half-life of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of FSH (3‚Äì4 hours) and hCG (24 hours). The biological half-life of LH is 23 hours subcutaneous or terminal half life of 10-12 hours.  Genes  The gene for the alpha subunit is located on chromosome 6q12.21. The luteinizing hormone beta subunit gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.32. In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells. It is regulated by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. Inhibin, activin, and sex hormones do not affect genetic activity for the beta subunit production of LH.  Function  500px In both males and females, LH works upon endocrine cells in the gonads to produce androgens. =Effects in females= LH supports theca cells in the ovaries that provide androgens and hormonal precursors for estradiol production. At the time of menstruation, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the rise in estrogens, LH receptors are also expressed on the maturing follicle, which causes it to produce more estradiol. Eventually, when the follicle has fully matured, a spike in 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone production by the follicle inhibits the production of estrogens, leading to a decrease in estrogen-mediated negative feedback of GnRH in the hypothalamus, which then stimulates the release of LH from the anterior pituitary. However another theory of the LH peak is a positive feedback mechanism from estradiol. The levels keep rising through the follicular phase and when they reach an unknown threshold, this results in the peak of the LH.Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology 2006 page 1021 This effect is opposite from the usual negative feedback mechanism presented at lower levels. In other words, the mechanism(s) are not yet clear. The increase in LH production only lasts for 24 to 48 hours. This \\"LH surge\\" triggers ovulation, thereby not only releasing the egg from the follicle, but also initiating the conversion of the residual follicle into a corpus luteum that, in turn, produces progesterone to prepare the endometrium for a possible implantation. LH is necessary to maintain luteal function for the second two weeks of the menstrual cycle. If pregnancy occurs, LH levels will decrease, and luteal function will instead be maintained by the action of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), a hormone very similar to LH but secreted from the new placenta. Gonadal steroids (estrogens and androgens) generally have negative feedback effects on GnRH-1 release at the level of the hypothalamus and at the gonadotropes, reducing their sensitivity to GnRH. Positive feedback by estrogens also occurs in the gonadal axis of female mammals and is responsible for the midcycle surge of LH that stimulates ovulation. Although estrogens inhibit kisspeptin (Kp) release from kiss1 neurons in the ARC, estrogens stimulate Kp release from the Kp neurons in the AVPV. As estrogens' levels gradually increase the positive effect predominates, leading to the LH surge. GABA-secreting neurons that innervate GnRH-1 neurons also can stimulate GnRH-1 release. These GABA neurons also possess ERs and may be responsible for the GnRH-1 surge. Part of the inhibitory action of endorphins on GnRH-1 release is through inhibition of these GABA neurons. Rupture of the ovarian follicle at ovulation causes a drastic reduction in estrogen synthesis and a marked increase in secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum in the ovary, reinstating a predominantly negative feedback on hypothalamic secretion of GnRH-1. =Effects in males = LH acts upon the Leydig cells of the testis and is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The Leydig cells produce testosterone under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of the enzyme 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that is used to convert androstenedione, the hormone produced by the testes, to testosterone. The onset of puberty is controlled by two major hormones: FSH initiates spermatogenesis and LH signals the release of testosterone. an androgen that exerts both endocrine activity and intratesticular activity on spermatogenesis. LH is released from the pituitary gland, and is controlled by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. When bloodstream testosterone levels are low, the pituitary gland is stimulated to release LH. As the levels of testosterone increase, it will act on the pituitary through a negative feedback loop and inhibit the release of GnRH and LH consequently. Androgens (including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the pineal gland, leading to increased melatonin and reduced LH and FSH by melatonin-induced increase of Gonadotropin-Inhibitory Hormone (GnIH) synthesis and secretion. Testosterone can also be aromatized into estradiol (E2) to inhibit LH. E2 decreases pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH from the hypothalamus onto the pituitary. Changes in LH and testosterone blood levels and pulse secretions are induced by changes in sexual arousal in human males.  Normal levels  Reference ranges for the blood content of luteinizing hormone (LH) during the menstrual cycle. LH levels are normally low during childhood and, in women, high after menopause. As LH is secreted as pulses, it is necessary to follow its concentration over a sufficient period of time to get proper information about its blood level. During the reproductive years, typical levels are between 1‚Äì20 IU/L. Physiologic high LH levels are seen during the LH surge (v.s.); typically they last 48 hours. In males over 18 years of age, reference ranges have been estimated to be 1.8‚Äì8.6 IU/L.Mayo Medical Laboratories - Test ID: LH, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Serum , retrieved December 2012 LH is measured in international units (IU). When quantifying the amount of LH in a sample in IUs, it is important to know which international standard your lot of LH was calibrated against, as they can vary broadly from year to year. For human urinary LH, one IU is most recently defined as 1/189th of an ampule denoted 96/602 and distributed by the NIBSC, corresponding to approximately 0.04656¬µg of LH protein for a single IU, but older standard versions are still widely in use.World Health Organization Proposed International Standard for Luteinizing Hormone.

National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. thumb  Predicting ovulation  fertilization by menstrual cycle day relative to ovulation. The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending ovulation. LH can be detected by urinary ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected. A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24‚Äì48 hours, giving women two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intention of conceiving. The recommended testing frequency differs between manufacturers. For example, the Clearblue test is taken daily, and an increased frequency does not decrease the risk of missing an LH surge. On the other hand, the Chinese company Nantong Egens Biotechnology recommends using their test twice per day. Version 1.1 02/11/15 If testing once per day, no significant difference has been found between testing LH in the morning versus in the evening, in relation to conception rates, and recommendations of what time in the day to take the test varies between manufacturers and healthcare workers.Page 67 in: Tests may be read manually using a color-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics. Tests for luteinizing hormone may be combined with testing for estradiol in tests such as the Clearblue fertility monitor. The sensitivity of LH tests are measured in milli international unit, with tests commonly available in the range 10‚Äì40 m.i.u. (the lower the number, the higher the sensitivity). As sperm can stay viable in the woman for several days, LH tests are not recommended for contraceptive practices, as the LH surge typically occurs after the beginning of the fertile window.  Disease states  = Excess = In children with precocious puberty of pituitary or central origin, LH and FSH levels may be in the reproductive range instead of the low levels typical for their age. During the reproductive years, relatively elevated LH is frequently seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome; however, it would be unusual for them to have LH levels outside of the normal reproductive range. Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of both LH and FSH. While this is typical in menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of: # Premature menopause # Gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome # Castration # Swyer syndrome # Polycystic ovary syndrome # Certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia # Testicular failure # Pregnancy - BetaHCG can mimic LH so tests may show elevated LH Note: A medical drug for inhibiting luteinizing hormone secretion is Butinazocine. = Deficiency = Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, amenorrhea is commonly observed. Conditions with very low LH secretions include: # Pasqualini syndrome # Kallmann syndrome # Hypothalamic suppression # Hypopituitarism # Eating disorder # Female athlete triad # Hyperprolactinemia # Hypogonadism # Gonadal suppression therapy ##GnRH antagonist ##GnRH agonist (inducing an initial stimulation (flare up) followed by permanent blockage of the GnRH pituitary receptor)  As a medication  LH is available mixed with FSH in the form of menotropin, and other forms of urinary gonadotropins. More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant LH is available as lutropin alfa (Luveris).Luveris information All these medications have to be given parenterally. They are commonly used in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, the notable one being in IVF therapy. Often, HCG medication is used as an LH substitute because it activates the same receptor. Medically used hCG is derived from urine of pregnant women, is less costly, and has a longer half- life than LH.  Role in Phosphorylation  Phosphorylation is a biochemical process that involves the addition of phosphate to an organic compound. Steroidogenesis entails processes by which cholesterol is converted to biologically active steroid hormones. Recent study shows that LH via a PKA signaling pathway regulates the phosphorylation and localization of DRP1 within mitochondria of the steroidogenic cells of the ovary.

Retrieved 27 October 2017 Plot The Beatles evade a horde of fans while boarding a train for London. En route, they meet Paul's trouble-making grandfather for the first time; he becomes so much of a nuisance that Paul has him locked up in the guards van, but he and the others soon join him inside. They play cards and entertain some schoolgirls before arriving at the London station, where they're quickly driven to a hotel and begin to feel cooped up. Their manager Norm tasks them with answering all their fan mail, but they sneak out to party, only to be caught by Norm and taken back. They then find out that the grandfather went to a gambling club using an invitation sent to Ringo, and, after a brief dust-up, they bring him back to the hotel. The next day, they arrive at a TV studio for a performance. After the initial rehearsal, the producer thinks they're out to sabotage his career (thanks to something the grandfather said). There is a press conference, where the Beatles are bored by the mundane questioning. They leave through a fire escape and cavort in a field until forced off by the owner. Back in the studios, they are separated when a woman named Millie recognizes John but cannot recall who he is. George is lured into a trendmonger's office to audition for an ad with a popular female model. The boys all return to rehearse a second song, and after a quick trip to makeup, smoothly go through a third and earn a break. With an hour before the final run-through, Ringo is forced to chaperone Paul's grandfather and takes him to the canteen for tea while he reads a book. The grandfather manipulates Ringo into going outside to experience life rather than reading books, passing a surprised John and Paul on the way out. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, takes pictures, walks alongside a canal and rides a bicycle along a railway station platform.This scene was filmed at Crowcombe Heathfield Station on the West Somerset Railway While the other three search in vain for Ringo, he is arrested on suspicion and taken to a police station, where Paul's grandfather joins him shortly after attempting to sell Beatles photos with forged signatures. The grandfather makes a break for it, runs back to the studio and tells the others about Ringo. Norm sends John, Paul and George to retrieve him. While doing so, the boys wind up in a Keystone Cops-style foot chase before arriving back at the studio with Ringo, with only minutes to spare before airtime.

However, also heard in the film is a portion of \\"Don't Bother Me\\", a George Harrison composition. * \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" (opening credits) * \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" * \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" (sample) * \\"Don't Bother Me\\" (Harrison) (sample) * \\"All My Loving\\" (sample) * \\"If I Fell\\" * \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" * \\"And I Love Her\\" * \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\\" * \\"Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\\" (instrumental) *\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" (reprise) * \\"Tell Me Why\\" * \\"She Loves You\\" *\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" (reprise; closing credits) In addition to the soundtrack album, an EP (in mono) of songs from the film titled Extracts From The Film A Hard Day's Night was released by Parlophone on 6 November 1964, having the following tracks: *Side A # \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" # \\"If I Fell\\" *Side B # \\"Tell Me Why\\" # \\"And I Love Her\\" =Song notes= * \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" was among several songs considered for the film but ultimately not included either as an on-camera performance or for usage as an audio-only track. It was to be used during the \\"escape/fire escape\\" sequence of the film, but ultimately director Richard Lester vetoed it because of its downbeat lyrics and it was replaced for that scene by \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\". Its status as an early contender for inclusion led to the song being included on the US soundtrack album. * In the 1982 US theatrical reissue of the film by Universal Pictures, under licence from Walter Shenson, the song \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" was used as the audio track for a prologue sequence to the film which consisted of stills from the film and publicity photographs as a tribute to Lennon consisting of a \\"Swingin'\\" early to mid-1960s-style collage of photos of the Beatles in 1964 around the time they were shooting the film. The prologue was assembled without the involvement or knowledge of the film's director Richard Lester, who subsequently expressed his disapproval of the addition. The prologue was not included on the 2000 restoration of the film. * The song \\"You Can't Do That\\" was filmed as part of the film's TV concert sequence, but was not included in the final cut of the film. At a point before a decision had been made to excise the song from the film, footage of that performance had been sent by the filmmakers and Brian Epstein to be aired on The Ed Sullivan Show as a tease to promote the forthcoming release of the film. The clip aired on the Sullivan show on Sunday, 24 May 1964 in conjunction with an interview with The Beatles specially filmed by Sullivan in London. An extract of the footage of the song performance was included in the 1994 documentary The Making of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". * The song \\"I Call Your Name\\" was cut from the film for unknown reasons. Screenplay The screenplay was written by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, \\"Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I thought he did a very good script.\\" Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like \\"a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room\\"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing. The script comments cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at one point a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only \\"you are...\\". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for \\"him\\", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan, after she puts on her glasses, agreeing that Lennon doesn't \\"look like him at all\\", and Lennon saying to himself that \\"she looks more like him than I do\\". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: \\"Uh, no, I'm a mocker\\", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. In the original interview Ringo admits he borrowed the line from John. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a \\"clean old man\\" sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a \\"dirty old man\\". Audiences also responded to the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, \\"The general aim of the film was to present what was apparently becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, talk to the people on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... [Everything was] still based on privilege‚Äîprivilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this... they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it.\\" Despite the fact that the original working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the film‚Äîit is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible on the wall behind the dancers. Production The film was shot for United Artists (UA) using a cin√©ma v√©rit√© style in black-and-white. The film was meant to be released in July 1964, and since it was already March when Lester got to filming, the entire film had to be produced over a period of sixteen weeks. It had a low budget for its time of ¬£200,000 ($500,000) and filming was finished in under seven weeks, leaving the rest of the time for post-production. At first, the film itself was something of a secondary consideration to UA, whose primary interest was in being able to release the soundtrack album in the United States before Capitol Records (the American EMI affiliate who had first shot at releasing Beatles music in the States) got around to issuing their material; in the words of Bud Ornstein, the European head of production for United Artists: \\"Our record division wants to get the soundtrack album to distribute in the States, and what we lose on the film we'll get back on this disc.\\" As film historian Stephen Glynn put it, A Hard Day's Night was intended as \\"a low-budget exploitation film to milk the latest brief musical craze for all it was worth.\\" Unlike most productions, it was filmed in near sequential order, as stated by Lennon in 1964.The Beatles, The Beatles Anthology (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, LCC, 2000, ), p. 267 Filming began on 2 March 1964 at Marylebone station in London (sometimes misidentified as Paddington). The Beatles had joined the actors' union, Equity, only that morning. The first week of filming was on a train travelling between London and Minehead. On 10 March, scenes with Ringo were shot at the Turk's Head pub in Twickenham, and over the following week various interior scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios. From 23 to 30 March, filming moved to the Scala Theatre, and on 31 March, concert footage was shot there, although the group mimed to backing tracks. The \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" segment, which featured creative camera work and the band running and jumping around in a field was shot on 23 April 1964 at Thornbury Playing Fields, Isleworth, Middlesex. The final scene was filmed the following day in West Ealing, London, where Ringo obligingly drops his coat over puddles for a lady to step on, only to discover that the final puddle is actually a large hole in the road.Mark Lewisohn, The Complete Beatles Chronicle (London: Pyramid Books, Hamlyn, 1992, ), p. 158 Before A Hard Day's Night was released in America, a United Artists executive asked Lester to dub the voices of the group with mid-Atlantic accents. McCartney angrily replied, \\"Look, if we can understand a fucking cowboy talking Texan, they can understand us talking Liverpool.\\" Lester subsequently directed the Beatles' 1965 film, Help!. The film's costumes‚Äîexcept for those of the Beatles themselves‚Äîwere designed by Julie Harris. The clothes of the Beatles were credited to Dougie Millings & Son. =Casting= Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, who played Paul McCartney's fictional grandfather John McCartney, was already well known to British television audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke that he was very \\"clean\\" reflects a contrast to his sitcom role, where he was always referred to as a \\"dirty old man\\". In other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part. The supporting cast included Richard Vernon as the \\"city gent\\" on the train and Lionel Blair as a featured dancer. There were also various cameos. John Bluthal played a car thief and an uncredited Derek Nimmo appeared as magician Leslie Jackson. David Janson (billed as David Jaxon here) played the small boy met by Ringo on his \\"walkabout\\". Rooney Massara, who went on to compete in the 1972 Munich Olympics, was the sculler in the river in the \\"walkabout\\" scene by the river at Kew (uncredited). Kenneth Haigh appeared as an advertising executive who mistakes George for a \\"new phenomenon.\\" David Langton also made a cameo appearance as an actor in the dressing room scene. Mal Evans, one of the Beatles' road managers, also appears briefly in the film‚Äîmoving an upright bass through a tight hallway as Lennon talks with the woman who mistakes him for someone else. George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, on the set when she made a brief (uncredited) appearance as one of the schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time, but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, later a member of the band Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience. Playing the buxom woman with Paul's grandfather in the casino scene was popular British 1960s pinup model Margaret Nolan (aka Vicky Kennedy), who also appeared as \\"Dink\\", the golden girl during the opening credits of the James Bond film Goldfinger, later that same year. =Cut for BBFC= The film had to be edited slightly to obtain the U certificate for British cinemas. The phrase \\"get knotted\\" (allegedly in reel 7 of the original submission) was judged inappropriate for a U film and had to be removed. When the film was submitted for release on VHS, the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) could not locate the phrase and presumed that the clip was \\"pre-cut\\", but stated that the phrase was no longer of any concern. The BBFC noted a number of innuendos and one subtle reference to cocaine, but concluded that it was still within the \\"natural category\\" for a U certificate. Reception The film premiered at the Pavilion Theatre in London on 6 July 1964‚Äîthe eve of Ringo Starr's 24th birthday‚Äîand the soundtrack was released four days later. A Hard Day's Night set records at the London Pavilion by grossing over $20,000 in the first week, ultimately becoming so popular that more than 1,600 prints were in circulation simultaneously. =Critical response= Reviews of the film were mostly positive; one oft-quoted assessment was provided by Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, labeling A Hard Day's Night \\"the Citizen Kane of jukebox musicals.\\" When The Village Voice published the results of its first annual film poll, A Hard Day's Night placed second behind Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 8.49/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"A Hard Day's Night, despite its age, is still a delight to watch and has proven itself to be a rock-and-roll movie classic.\\" It is number four on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the Top Ten Musicals and Performing Arts films. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 96 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Time magazine called the film \\"One of the smoothest, freshest, funniest films ever made for purposes of exploitation.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert described the film as \\"one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies\\", and added it to his list of The Great Movies. In 2004, Total Film magazine named A Hard Day's Night the 42nd greatest British film of all time. In 2005, Time.com named it one of the 100 best films of the last 80 years. Leslie Halliwell gave the film his highest rating, four stars, the only British film of 1964 to achieve that accolade. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther noted the film was a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are constantly amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing more than a little peace and quiet; however, they have to deal with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact, their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but \\"clean\\" grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: \\"Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds.\\" A Hard Day's Night was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Screenplay (Alun Owen), and Best Score (Adaptation) (George Martin). By 1971, the film was estimated to have earned $11 million worldwide. Influence British critic Leslie Halliwell states the film's influence as \\"it led directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties\\". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, and it is this segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing \\"a new grammar\\": \\"he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night\\". Film theorist James Monroe writes, \\"The lively 1960s films of Richard Lester‚Äîespecially his Musicals A Hard Day‚Äôs Night (1964), Help! (1965), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966)‚Äîpopularized jump cuts, rapid and 'ungrammatical' cutting. Over time, his brash editorial style became a norm, now celebrated every night around the world in hundreds of music videos on MTV and in countless commercials.\\" In an interview for the DVD re- release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test. Title The film's title originated from something said by Ringo Starr, who described it this way in an interview with disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: \\"We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night.\\" According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: \\"I was going home in the car, and Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'\\"cited in In a 1994 interview for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr's verbal misstep: \\"The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'\\" Yet another version of events appeared in 1996; producer Walter Shenson said that Lennon had described to him some of Starr's funnier gaffes, including \\"a hard day's night\\", whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the film. Regardless of which of these origin stories is the true one, the original tentative title for the film had been \\"Beatlemania\\" and when the new title was agreed upon, it became necessary to write and quickly record a new title song, which was completed on 16 April, just eight days before filming was finished. John Lennon wrote the song in one night, (credited to Lennon-McCartney) basing the lyrics on a birthday card sent to his young son Julian, and it went on to win a Grammy for Best Performance by a Vocal Group. The film was titled Yeah Yeah Yeah in Germany and Sweden, Tutti Per Uno (All for One) in Italy, Quatre gar√ßons dans le vent (Four Boys in the Wind) in France Yeah! Yeah! T√§ss√§ tulemme! (Yeah! Yeah! Here We Come!) in Finland and Os Reis do I√™-I√™-I√™ (The Kings of Yeah- yeah-yeah) in Brazil. Novelisation In 1964, Pan Books published a novelisation of the film by author John Burke, described as \\"based on the original screenplay by Alun Owen\\". The book was priced at two shillings and sixpence and contained an 8-page section of photographs from the film. It is the first book in the English language to have the word 'grotty' in it.

In Japan, voice actors and actresses have devoted fan clubs due to a crossover with the idol industry, and some fans may watch a show merely to hear a particular voice actor. Many voice actors have concurrent singing careers and have also crossed over to live-action media. There are around 130 voice acting schools in Japan. Broadcast companies and talent agencies often have their own troupes of vocal actors. Magazines focusing specifically on voice acting are published in Japan, with Voice Animage being the longest running. The term character voice (abbreviated CV) has been commonly used since the 1980s by such Japanese anime magazines as ' and Newtype to describe a voice actor associated with a particular anime or game character. Definition and role A provides voice-overs for characters and narration for various types of media, including anime, video games, audio dramas, live-action stunt and puppet shows, and commercials. A voice actor also provides dubbing for non- Japanese television programs and films. The initial term for voice actors in Japan was , but was later shortened to a compound word to make the word . While several voice actors opposed the term, believing it devalued their roles as actors, only after voice acting became more prominent did the word become more widespread. There are three main factors that set voice actors and actors apart. * Their professional upbringing by the , formed by NHK and other private networks during the golden age of radio dramas. * The lack of Japan- made movies and dramas forced TV networks to air foreign shows, which raised demand for voice actors. * The boom in the anime world market, which produced a wave of young talents who wanted to become voice actors, rather than actors. History Voice acting has existed in Japan since the advent of radio. It was only in the 1970s that the term seiy≈´ entered popular usage because of the anime Space Battleship Yamato. According to a newspaper interview with a voice talent manager, \\"Since the Yamato boom, the word 'seiy≈´' has become instantly recognised; before that, actors and actresses who introduced themselves as seiy≈´ were often asked, 'You mean you work for Seiyu supermarket?'\\" =Radio drama era= In 1925, the Tokyo Broadcasting Company (predecessor to the NHK, Japan's public broadcasting system) started radio broadcasts. In that same year, twelve students who were specialising in voice-only performances became the first voice actors in Japan when a performance of a radio drama was broadcast. They referred to themselves as \\"seiy≈´\\", but in those days the term was used by newspapers to refer to the profession. In 1941, NHK opened a training program to the public to prepare actors to specialise in radio dramas.This was called the . Then in 1942, the Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe debuted its first performance. This was the second time that the term \\"seiy≈´\\" was used to refer to voice actors. There are several theories as to how the term \\"seiy≈´\\" was coined. One theory is that Oyhashi Tokusaburo, a reporter for the Yomiuri Newspaper, coined the term. Another theory is that Tatsu Ooka, an entertainment programming managing producer for the NHK, came up with it. At first, voice actors, like those at the Tokyo Radio Drama Troupe and similar companies specialised in radio dramas; with the advent of television, the term took on the additional meaning of one who does dubbing for animation. Television broadcasting aside, when radio was the leading mass medium, actors who played in radio dramas were not without their fans; for example, actors in the Nagoya Radio Drama troupe who played the lead love interest roles often received many fan letters. =1960s= In 1961, during the early days of commercial television broadcasting, the Five-Company Agreement (Gosha Agreement) caused the supply of Japanese movies that were available to Japanese television stations to dry up. As a result, in the 1960s many foreign dramas and other foreign programming was imported and dubbed into Japanese language for television broadcast. At first, the NHK subtitled most foreign shows; however, shows dubbed in the Japanese language soon became the standard. At the centre of the first voice acting boom were actors like Nachi Nozawa, who dubbed the same foreign actors, in Nozawa's case Alain Delon, Robert Redford, and Giuliano Gemma. Because of problems with pay guarantees arising from the Gosha Agreement, cinema actors were prevented from dubbing foreign movies for television. Television actors were also prevented from dubbing because of a similar agreement. This caused studios to turn to actors from the radio age and actors from the Shingeki style of acting. Around this time dubbing of foreign animation was done by Rakugo story tellers, Asakusa comedians, and the like, and voice actors were called \\"dubbing talents\\" if they specialised in dubbing, while those giving voice to a character went under the name of \\"ateshi\\". It is during this golden age for dubbing that the Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society was founded. Later, Haikyo voice acting managers left and opened their own management agencies. Voice actors in Japan also voiced anime. The first dubbed show broadcast in Japan was an episode of the American cartoon Superman, on October 9, 1955, on KRT (today TBS), and the first non-animated dubbed show broadcast was Cowboy G-Men, again by KRT, in 1956. Both were dubbed live; the first show to be broadcast with pre-recorded dubbing was on April 8, 1956. =1970s= During the late 1970s, Akio Nojima, Kazuyuki Sogabe, Akira Kamiya, T≈çru Furuya and Toshio Furukawa were the first to unite into a band, Slapstick, and perform live. Many other voice actors released their own albums. At around 1979 the first anime magazines began to be published. The then editor-in-chief of Animage, Hideo Ogata, was the first to publish editorials on the ongoing transformation of voice actors into idols. Following his lead, the other magazines created \\"seiy≈´ corners\\" with information and gossip about voice actors; this was one of the main causes of young anime fans yearning to become voice actors. This led to a sudden increase in the number of students in voice acting schools. For the first time, anime voice actors were young people who grew up dreaming to become that, as opposed to being members of drama troupes or theatre actors who performed as a hobby. This boom lasted until the first half of the 1980s. =1980s= In 1989, the voice actors of the five main stars of the animated television show Ronin Warriors (Nozomu Sasaki, Takeshi Kusao, Hiroshi Takemura, Tomohiro Nishimura and Daiki Nakamura) formed an all-male singing group called \\"NG5\\". The group was featured as the subject of a special documentary program on MBS. During this period, voice acting production companies also began to provide specialised courses at on-site training schools specifically for training in animation dubbing. =1990s= Voice actress Maria Yamamoto in 2005 The 1960s and 1970s booms were centered on media, such as the TV. In the 1990s, a new boom centred on more personal ways of communication, such as radio shows, Original Video Animation, television quizzes, public events and the Internet, gave way to the publication of the first dedicated voice acting magazines, and Voice Animage. Voice actors acquired many new fans thanks to the radio, and their CD sale figures increased. Concerts began to be held in the bigger halls. While the second boom also saw the voice actors become DJs, this time the recording houses backed the voice actor radio shows as sponsors, and large sums of money began to circulate. Megumi Hayashibara, Hekiru Shiina and Mariko Kouda are the first examples of this new trend. Recording companies and voice acting schools began to devise new ways to raise young voice actors. When voice acting was introduced in television games, the same voice actors would perform in a series of events related to the television game world, making appearances and participating in radio programs based on the television games to attract the fanbase. In the second half of the 1990s, the boom in the animation world led to the increase of anime shown in the Tokyo area. With the Internet, gathering information on their favourite voice actors became easy for fans, and voice actors began to appear in Internet-based radio shows. From to , the world's first digital satellite radio broadcaster, St.GIGA, transmitted episodic video games with voice acted overdubs in a separate and continually streaming vocal track (a technique called SoundLink), to be played in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom video game console with its Satellaview peripheral.„Åï„Çà„Å™„Çâ„Çª„É≥„Éà„Éª„ÇÆ„Ç¨.

Prominent examples include Aya Hirano, Koharu Kusumi, and Nana Mizuki, all of whom were established actors or singers in mainstream entertainment before entering voice acting. While character song tie-ins were already common in the film industry by then, some voice actors also began making crossover television, stage, and concert appearances as their characters as well, leading them to be closely associated with one another. The term \\"2.5D\\", which picked up frequent usage in the mid-2010s, was used to describe voice actors who would portray their characters in real life, such as television or stage plays. Over the mid-to- late 2010s, multimedia projects where the voice actors would appear as their characters in real-life became popular, such as Love Live!

The freehold of the line and stations is owned by Somerset County Council; the railway is leased to and operated by West Somerset Railway plc (WSR plc); which is supported and minority-owned by charitable trust the West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA) and the West Somerset Steam Railway Trust (WSSRT). The WSR plc operates services using both heritage steam and diesel trains. It originally opened in 1862 between and . In 1874 it was extended from Watchet to by the Minehead Railway. Although just a single line, improvements were needed in the first half of the twentieth century to accommodate the significant number of tourists that wished to travel to the Somerset coast. The line was closed by British Rail in 1971 and reopened in 1976 as a heritage line. It is the longest standard gauge independent heritage railway in the United Kingdom. Services normally operate over just the between Minehead and . During special events some trains continue a further to where a connection to Network Rail allows occasional through trains to operate onto the national network. History In 1845, when the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;) had recently completed its main line, there were proposals for a number of different and competitive railway schemes in west Somerset. A Bristol and English Channels Direct Junction Railway was proposed as a link from Watchet through Stogumber and Bishops Lydeard to Bridport on the south coast, which would be an alternative to ships taking a long and dangerous passage around Land's End. This prompted the promotion of a connecting line from Williton to Minehead and Porlock, a line designed to attract tourists to Exmoor. Shortly afterwards, a Bristol and English Channels Connection Railway was suggested from Stolford to Bridport which would have passed through the Quantock Hills near Crowcombe. Alternatively, the Bridgwater and Minehead Junction Railway would link with the B&ER; at Bridgwater and run through Williton to Minehead with a branch to Watchet and a connecting Minehead and Central Devon Junction Railway would provide a line to Exeter. An alternative link to South Devon was proposed by the Exeter, Tiverton and Minehead Direct Railway through Dunster and offered an extension to Ilfracombe. =West Somerset Railway Company= None of these schemes were pursued and it was to be more than ten years before schemes for railways in the area were to be again proposed. On 9 July 1856, local land owner Sir Peregrine Fuller Palmer Acland of Fairfield House, Stogursey arranged a meeting at the Egremont Hotel in Williton. The advertised purpose was to discuss a \\"Railway from the West Somerset iron-fields and coast, to the Bristol & Exeter Railway,\\" proposed to connect Watchet - then a major port on the River Severn, as well as one of the largest industrial towns in Somerset, although in decline in importance thanks to the railways - to join the B&ER; at either the county town of Taunton or the large port town of Bridgwater. The promoters had already approached Isambard Kingdom Brunel for his views as the former engineer of the B&ER;, and by the time of the meeting he had already undertaken a preliminary survey of the alternative routes. There were three alternate options: *The Rev. J. Llewellyn, of Wiveliscombe, suggested a route leaving the existing WSMR at Washford, then passing through Monksilver, Elworthy, Brompton Regis, Ford, Milverton and Hillfarrance, and onwards to the B&ER.; *The second and third options bypassed the WSMR, running directly from Watchet to Williton to follow the Donniford valley to Crowcombe, and then either: **To Triscombe and via a tunnel through the Quantock Hills to Bridgewater. The promoters were initially keen to build the tunnel, as the Ironstone in this part of Somerset was similar to that found in South Wales, amongst which were found rich seams of coal **Or directly onwards to Taunton, and via the B&ER; to Bridgwater In his contribution, Brunel described the valley of \\"a little brook called Donniford Brook \\" as being of prime importance to any route. He had concluded that the starting point should be either Watchet or Porlock, then direct to Williton to follow the Donniford Brook as far as Triscombe. Brunel then gave the initial calculations on the required tunnel to reach Bridgwater, which being 70 to 80 chains in length would require 50 shafts to be sunk, and as it also required approaches with a 1 in 50 gradient, would be very expensive. In his conclusion, Brunel stated his preference as a route from Watchet via Williton to Taunton, stating it to be both cheaper and offering more development options to increase passenger loading. The first meeting had been dominated by people from Minehead, Wiveliscombe and Bridgwater but, on 1 August 1856, a second meeting was held in Taunton. Brunel explained to those present the advantages of the different routes and gave some weight to the argument for a route to Bridgwater with a long tunnel under the Quantocks. He also suggested that the line should be continued to Minehead or Porlock but the meeting resolved to construct a railway only from Taunton to Watchet. Brunel was engaged to undertake a more detailed survey and the B&ER; agreed to operate the line for ten years in return for 45% of the receipts. Plans were produced as required by British law in November 1856 and the West Somerset Railway Company was incorporated on 17 August 1857 by an Act of Parliament to build a railway from Taunton to Watchet. A prospectus was issued to raise the required ¬£120,000 and these were all subscribed by the end of the year. The railway's engineer, George Furness of London, started construction on 7 April 1859 at Crowcombe and construction lasted for nearly three years. The railway opened for passengers from Watchet Junction ( west of Taunton) to on 31 March 1862; goods traffic commenced in August. Trains were operated through to Taunton railway station as no station was provided at the junction. On 8 June 1871 a second junction was brought into use where the WSR joined the B&ER; main line for the Devon and Somerset Railway and a station was finally opened here, known as , on 8 June 1871 but branch line trains continued to operate through to Taunton. =Minehead Railway= The West Somerset Mineral Railway (WSMR) was intended to link the iron-ore mines of the Brendon Hills with the harbour at Watchet. In 1856, before it was even opened, it was suggested that the WSMR should be extended to Minehead instead of the WSR and an Act of Parliament for this work was passed on 27 July 1857 but it was never constructed. Instead, an Act for a new Minehead Railway was passed on 5 July 1865 to build a line from the WSR at Watchet to Minehead. This again failed to be built but a renewed Minehead Railway Act of 29 June 1871 finally saw the construction begin the following year. The new railway was opened on 16 July 1874. In 1871, the WSR had agreed a new perpetual lease to the B&ER; for a fixed sum each year which rose annually to a maximum of ¬£6,600. The new Minehead Railway too was leased to the B&ER; which then operated the two railways as a single branch from Taunton. To break up the of single track, a passing loop and second platform were installed at Williton, from the junction. =Part of the Great Western= On 1 January 1876, the B&ER; was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR). To increase the capacity of the West Somerset line, another loop was opened in 1879 at . The broad gauge was converted to standard gauge in 1882. Trains ran as usual on Saturday 28 October but the track was lifted the following day and reopened for traffic on Monday afternoon. The Minehead Railway was amalgamated into the GWR in 1897 but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company for the time being although all its assets continued to be leased to the bigger company. Under Great Western influence, there were steady improvements in the line as it carried an increasing level of holiday traffic to the Somerset coast and Exmoor. The platform at Stogumber was extended in 1900, a new passing loop was opened in 1904 at and, the following year, a second platform was opened at Minehead. A third loop was installed in 1906, this time at and the loop at Williton was lengthened in 1907. Under the Railways Act 1921, the West Somerset Railway Company was finally amalgamated into the Great Western Railway but the Minehead branch, as the route was now known, continued to be operated by the newly enlarged GWR. In the 1930s, alterations were made to significantly increase the number and length of trains that could be handled. The mainline from Norton Fitzwarren through Taunton to Cogload Junction was increased from two to four tracks on 2 December 1931 and the junction station was enlarged which meant that it was better able to cope with the trains on all three routes. In 1933, the platform at was extended to accommodate longer trains and two further passing loops were opened. These were at Leigh Bridge south of Stogumber and at Kentford west of Watchet. The following year saw the original single track doubled between and Minehead and the platform at the terminus was lengthened. The loop at Blue Anchor was also lengthened in 1934, the line was doubled from Norton Fitzwarren to Bishops Lydeard in 1936 and the Williton loop was lengthened for a second time in 1937. Camp coaches were placed at Blue Anchor from 1934 to 1939 and at Stogumber from 1935 to 1939, which encouraged holiday makers to use the train to reach these rural locations. In 1936, the GWR's chairman, Sir Robert Horne, opened the new ¬£20,000 open-air swimming pool at Minehead. =Run down to closure= The GWR was nationalised, becoming the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. Camp coaches made a reappearance in 1952 and were available to the public at both Stogumber and Blue Anchor from 1952 to 1964; the latter were kept on for British Rail staff holidays until 1970. However, Washford signal box was closed in 1952 and Minehead engine shed was closed in 1956. Norton Fitzwarren station closed on 30 October 1961, after which passengers once again had to travel through to Taunton to change onto trains travelling west. Despite the opening of a Butlins holiday camp at Minehead in 1962 which brought some 30,000 people to the town that year, the line was recommended for closure in the 1963 Reshaping of British Railways report. Goods traffic was withdrawn from Stogumber on 17 August 1963 and from the other stations on 6 July 1964 after which British Rail transported any goods traffic by road from Taunton. By this time the passing loops at Leigh Bridge and Kentford had been taken out of use, in April and May 1964 respectively. Minehead signal box was closed on 27 March 1966 after which the two tracks between there and Dunster were operated as two bi-directional single lines, one to each platform. Dunster Signal Box was retained to control the level crossing and points there, and ground frames allowed the train crew to change the points at Minehead to allow locomotives to run round from one end of the train to the other. The original turntable was removed from Minehead in 1967 by which time all trains were operated by diesels. With the line still proposed for closure, the Transport Users Consultative Committee heard from the Western National bus company that it would require twenty buses in the summer to cope with the influx of holidaymakers, but that most would be idle for much of the year when far fewer people travelled to Minehead and the surrounding district. In an attempt to make the loss-making line profitable, BR reduced the double track from Norton Fitzwarren to one track on 1 March 1970 and closed the signal boxes at Bishops Lydeard and Norton Fitzwarren. This left the branch with three sections (Silk Mills to Williton; Williton to Dunster; Dunster to Minehead) but still required seven staff per shift as there were three signal boxes and four level crossings. The line continued to make a loss so was eventually closed. The last train left Minehead on 2 January 1971; this was a Saturday and the following Monday 4 an enhanced bus service came into operation. =Closure= Over the following five-year period, the line was kept in \\"possible to return to operations\\" status, but lineside shrubbery quickly took over the infrastructure. In 1975, after Butlins Minehead holiday camp decided to modernise and refurbish, it was proposed to extract LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 Duchess of Hamilton, purchased by Billy Butlin in 1966 along with LB&SCR; A1 class Knowle (transported out by road), under an offer made by British Railways. This required a full-time two-week incursion of a permanent way team to clear the line pathway, before BR Class 25 diesel No.25 059 and a BR brakevan could make a traverse in March 1975. The trackwork of the run round loop of No.1 platform was removed from the upline at , to allow transporter Pickfords to make a suitable railhead connection to enable release of No.6229 Duchess of Hamilton. =Heritage railway= Vulcan at Williton in 1981 On 5 February 1971, a Minehead Railway Preservation Society organised a meeting in Taunton and a working party headed by Douglas Fear, a local businessman, was tasked with investigating how the line could be reopened as a privately owned railway. In May, a new West Somerset Railway Company was formed to acquire the line and operate a year-round commuter service from Minehead to Taunton alongside which a limited summer steam service could also run. A deal was agreed with British Rail to purchase the line with the support of Somerset County Council, however the council was wary of the lucrative Minehead station site falling into private hands should the railway fail. Instead, it purchased the line itself in 1973 and leased back the operational land to the West Somerset Railway Company plc. The proposed commuter service never materialised, due to traffic restrictions between the newly installed Taunton Cider Company sidings at and Taunton, but the line was slowly reopened as a heritage railway. Minehead to Blue Anchor was the first section to see trains restored, opening on 28 March 1976 and services were extended to Williton on 28 August the same year. Trains returned to Stogumber on 7 May 1978 and they reached Bishops Lydeard on 9 June 1979. A new station at was opened on the coast east of Watchet on 27 June 1987 to serve a holiday camp at Helwell Bay. In 2004, work started on constructing a new triangle at Norton Fitzwarren which included a part of the old Devon and Somerset line, and a ballast reclamation depot opened there in 2006. In 2008, a new turntable was brought into use at Minehead. A new station opened on 1 August 2009 at Norton Fitzwarren on a new site a short distance north of the main line. During 2007 a regular service ran from Minehead to Taunton and on a couple of days each week. Known as the Minehead Express, it was aimed at holidaymakers travelling to Butlins at Minehead. It left Minehead at 11:10 and Bristol at 14:06 with Victa Westlink's s 31452 and 31454 powering the five coaches. 31128 was available as a spare locomotive but was not used on the service trains. The first of these trains ran on 20 July and operated on a total of 18 days, finishing on 27 August. Whilst the freehold of the line continues to be owned by Somerset County Council, during 2013 it was announced that both the WSRA and the WSR plc had approached the county council about the possibility of purchasing the freehold of the line. The council made the decision in late May 2014 not to sell the freehold after all. A May 2018 county transport strategy acknowledged that there were plans to reintroduce services between Taunton and Minehead. Following an inspection by the Office of Rail and Road in 2018, it was announced that the railway would close from 2 January 2019, and would reopen on 1 April. The inspection found that several safety improvements needed to be made. The line was suggested in 2019 by Campaign for a Better Transport as a 'priority 2' candidate for reopening as part of the national network. Route The route is described from Minehead towards Taunton. Features are described as being on the left or right of the line for passengers facing this direction of travel, therefore the right side of the train is generally on the south or west of the line. On the railway this is known as the 'up' direction. =Minehead to Watchet= Communities served: Minehead ‚Äì Dunster ‚Äì Carhampton and Blue Anchor ‚Äì Washford ‚Äì Watchet The station at is situated on the sea front close to the town centre. The platform has a track on each side and the old goods shed, which is now used for locomotive maintenance, is situated on the north side between the platform and the beach. On the opposite side of the station is a turntable and the station cafe. Sidings on both sides of the station are used to hold stock, both operating vehicles and others awaiting repairs in the workshops. At the far end of the station is the signal box and level crossing over Seaward Way, a link road from the A39 to the seafront that was built in the 1990s. Trains leave Minehead heading south-eastwards on the longest straight and level section of track along the whole line, passing behind Butlin's holiday camp which is on the left between the railway and the sea and then across flat fields. from Minehead the line crosses Dunster West level crossing and enters station. It is a mile from the village of that name which is on the hill to the right along with Dunster Castle. The platform at Dunster is on the right while the old goods yard on the left is now used by the WSR's civil engineering team who keep the tracks in good order. On leaving the station is another level crossing, this time over Sea Lane that leads down to Dunster Beach which can be glimpsed to the left of the train. A footpath leads from the east end of the platform down to Sea Lane to save a long walk round along the road. The line then continues across the concrete channel of the River Avill onto Ker Moor and along the edge of the beach to reach , from Minehead and the first passing loop. Approaching the station, the old goods yard is on the right and three camp coaches are kept here where volunteers working on the railway can stay overnight. At the western end of the platform, a signal box overlooks a level crossing on the road from Blue Anchor to Carhampton. The West Somerset Steam Railway Trust's museum is on the right-hand platform. The line now leaves the sea and swings inland in a south east direction, climbing at gradients up to 1 in 65 (1.5%), the steepest section of the line. After turning back towards the north east, the line reaches the second highest point on the line at . This is from Minehead and has a single platform on the right. On the opposite side of the line, the goods yard is now the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust's museum with its collection of rolling stock and a display of signalling equipment. The line now swings north-eastwards and starts to descend, initially at 1 in 74 (1.35%). A footpath on the right of the line at a slightly lower level is the route of the old West Somerset Mineral Railway, which passes beneath the line on the approach to Watchet. After passing the former junction to the Wansbrough Paper Mill on the right, the line passes under a small road bridge, before arriving at Watchet railway station, from Minehead. =Watchet to Bishops Lydeard= Communities served: Watchet ‚Äì Williton ‚Äì Stogumber and Kingswood ‚Äì Crowcombe ‚Äì Bishops Lydeard Station sign at Williton The platform at Watchet is on the right of the train but the station building is unusually set back from the line and faces Taunton, a hangover from its construction as the terminus of the original West Somerset Railway. The old goods shed is opposite the platform and now houses the Watchet Boat Museum. A footbridge crosses the line at the Minehead end of the station and a foot crossing leads across the track at the other end of the platform which gives access to the harbour for train passengers. The line climbs away into a cutting through a headland but soon swings round to a south-easterly direction along the cliff above Helwell Bay. Passing under the Watchet to West Quantoxhead road, the line turns southwards and passes the concrete platform at , which is on the left of the train from Minehead. The agricultural landscape is then soon supplanted on the right by the sidings around the West Somerset Railway Association's (WSRA) workshops, which are housed in a corrugated iron building known as the Swindon Shed as it was originally built there more than 100 years ago. Watchet is being used as the terminus of trains from Bishops Lydeard in March and April 2019 due to engineering works at Minehead.http://www.wsr.org.uk/news.htm#1715 Williton railway station, at , is near the midpoint of the operational railway and the second passing loop. Behind the platform on the right, next to the WSRA workshops, are the old goods shed and the more modern workshop which is the home to the Diesel and Electric Preservation Group's fleet of diesel locomotives. The main station building is also on this platform, as is the oldest signal box on the line which stands above the level crossing. This sees little road traffic as most crosses the railway on the A39 road bridge that stands just beyond the end of the passing loop. Next to the level crossing on the left of the line is a garden with a decorative box hedge that is over 100 years old. A train near Williton in 1960 Leaving Williton, the railway crosses over the A358 road and climbs up onto the side of the Quantock Hills. Passing close to the village of Bicknoller, it crosses the Macmillan Way West, a long- distance footpath. Following the eastern side of a steep valley, it continues to rise with sections at 1 in 100 and 1 in 92 (1.1%) as it approaches the small station at , from Minehead. This station unusually has its platform on the right of the train but the station offices are on the left. The space alongside the offices is now a well-maintained garden but is where the goods shed used to stand. The line continues to climb 1 in 92 up the valley until, from Minehead, it reaches the summit of the line at . This is another passing loop but the down platform (on the right) is signalled to allow trains to run in either direction; the original platform was on the left of the line and so the main buildings are all on this side of the line. From the Minehead end, they include the old station master's house, some modern housing in sympathetic style and the station offices. After leaving Crowcombe Heathfield, it is downhill, with sections as steep as 1 in 81 (1.2%). At Combe Florey, the line crosses the A358 two more times in quick succession and this remains close on the left of the line to . This station has another passing loop and is the terminus of regular operations, from Minehead. Locomotives are kept in a secure compound on the left at the Taunton end of the station. Both platforms are signalled for running in either direction and most trains run from the one on the left, although the original buildings are all on the right. These include the goods shed which now houses a railway museum and the old station master's house. =Bishops Lydeard to Taunton= Communities served: Bishops Lydeard ‚Äì Norton Fitzwarren ‚Äì Taunton The station sign at This section beyond Bishops Lydeard carries no regularly scheduled passenger trains nowadays but occasional special services operate. During special events, a shuttle service is often operated between Bishops Lydeard and the new platform that opened at Norton Fitzwarren in 2009. A few special trains also operate over the link between the West Somerset Railway and Network Rail, running through to Taunton and beyond. The line passes the Norton Manor Royal Marine camp on the left and then passes under Allerford bridge and the new Allerford Junction where a siding has been installed on the right to serve the West Somerset Railway Association's ballast reclamation depot. Just beyond the junction, on the right, is the concrete platform erected in 2009 at . The West Somerset Railway's line terminates here and trains running through to Taunton run onto Network Rail's tracks. The remains of the station hotel are seen on the left but the track joins the Bristol to Exeter line on the right. Passing the engineers' depot at Fairwater Yard on the right, one soon arrives at , the traditional junction station for trains running the to Minehead. =Norton Fitzwarren triangle= GWR Autocoach No.178 is propelled to station by auto- fitted 4575 Class 5542. Behind is the WSRA's ballast dump, which holds ballast to be used on the railway or resold as aggregates On 24 March 2004, the WSRA announced the purchase of of land at Norton Fitzwarren. The triangular piece of land is located between: the existing WSR line from Allerford bridge (B3227) south to the junction with Network Rail; the westward running residual trackbed of the Barnstaple branch from Network Rail junction to the first lane crossing the former trackbed in the west; the Barnstaple Branch stub back north to Allerford bridge. The purchase of the land was announced as the first step in a 20-year programme to create a new train turning facility, alongside a national-scale \\"Heritage Railway Development\\" encompassing: an engine shed; carriage works; and railway engineering facility. In 2009, just beyond the new Allerford junction, the WSR constructed a new 4-carriage length station on the original WSR/Network Rail line, creating a new station on WSR metals, just west of the original GWR location. Network Rail's (NR) Fairwater Yard track maintenance facility is a short distance east of Norton Fitzwarren. Due to the high costs of ballast disposal from the site, NR approached the railway about using the triangle site as a commercial recycling site, allowing reclaimed ballast to be used in the local construction industry. After gaining planning permission from Somerset County Council, and approval of a drainage plan from the Environment Agency (conditions of which stipulate that the site must be fully reverted to meadow pasture at the termination of ballast recycling operations) the WSRA came to an agreement with NR to utilise spent ballast and rail from their track renewals programme. NR maintenance trains occasionally run from Fairwater Yard to Norton Fitzwarren to drop off spent materials at the site. A commercial operator sorts the ballast under contract to the WSRA. The funds generated from ballast recycling allowed the WSRA to develop the triangle as originally proposed and an inner chord to create sufficient space in which to safely turn trains before the junction with the main line. Visiting BR Standard Class 7 70000 Britannia was the first locomotive to officially be turned on the Norton Fitzwarren triangle during the Spring Steam Gala in March 2012. Operation A service of four trains each way Monday to Saturday was advertised when the railway first opened to Watchet, but this fluctuated to five or six at times for many years. A very limited Sunday service was introduced in 1862 but was withdrawn in 1869. An engine shed was provided at originally Watchet so that trains could start from that end of the line. This was moved to Minehead when the line was extended to there, but the frequency of services remained much the same. With the improvements to the line in the early years of the century, the frequency increased to eight trains daily by 1910 and to 14 before World War II. Sunday services resumed in 1926 for the first time in over 50 years. The engine shed was closed in 1956 after which time all trains were provided from the Taunton end and the timetable was cut back to ten round trips. Diesels started to appear regularly from 1962, both locomotive-hauled trains and diesel multiple units (DMUs). Class 150 visits with a special service from the main line As of 2009, regular services operate between Minehead and Bishops Lydeard. The operating season runs from March to October, with infrequent operations from November through to February. Trains run daily during the summer but less frequently during the remainder of the season. Four regular timetables are run on different days depending on expected demand, varying from two to four trains in operation, each of which makes two round trips which gives between four and eight services each way. From February 2009 to January 2010, services were advertised on 243 days. Operating locomotives are based at Minehead and Bishops Lydeard and a spare is generally kept ready at Williton. During special events, an intensive service is operated and some workings continue through to Norton Fitzwarren. A few railtours each year come through from Network Rail using the connection near Taunton. The heritage railway also carries some freight traffic from time to time. At one time this was carrying stone for Minehead sea defences, in conjunction with Mendip Rail. In more recent years it has seen Freightliner-hauled Network Rail trains discharge old ballast at Norton Fitzwarren for recycling. =Signalling= The signal box and road crossing at , looking downhill towards the Bristol Channel The railway is separated into five nominal block sections: *Network Rail boundary at Norton Fitzwarren (milepost 1651/4) to Bishops Lydeard: One Train Working (OTW) with a wooden staff block control is used on this section. The staff is sent by car to when through trains operate from Network Rail. There are no intermediate loops, but three ground frame operated points to allow access and turning on the Norton Triangle. *Bishops Lydeard to Crowcombe Heathfield: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes. The blocks are controlled from here to Blue Anchor by Train Staff and Ticket (TST). Crowcombe Heathfield signal box can be switched-out, creating a double section with the next block, with control then via a long staff. *Crowcombe Heathfield to Williton: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes, with the block controlled by TST. *Williton to Blue Anchor: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes, with the block controlled by TST. *Blue Anchor to Minehead: both stations have loops or facilities controlled by signal boxes. This section uses Electric Key Token (EKT) control, which is being extended block-by-block towards Bishops Lydeard. Communication between signal boxes for block working is by British Telecom circuits, except the Minehead ‚Äì Blue Anchor section which is by block bell using a system of bell codes. The signal boxes use two types of frame, both manufactured at the GWR signal works in . The older frames are the 1892 developed Stud frame, which replaced the original twist frames. It operates in a similar manner to tappet locking except that the blades are curved. The remained signal boxes use 5-bar tappet locking frames dating from the 1930s. Power supply within the boxes is standard 110-volt AC, 50 Hz, derived via transformer from the standard UK/EU 230-volts AC individual supplies. Inside the box, most voltages are DC, with standards derived from those in operations during British Railways ownership of the line. Isolated level crossings are fed direct from mains supply, but use a locally derived railway standard 24-volts DC. =Rolling stock= 88 with a train of Mark I coaches Photographs of the line when operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway show that their 4-4-0ST locomotives were the regular motive power. Later years saw types such as GWR 4500, 4575, and 5101 'prairie' 2-6-2Ts, 2251 'Collett goods' 0-6-0s, 5700 'pannier tank' 0-6-0PTs and 4300 'mogul' 2-6-0s. In British Railways' time, these were replaced by Western Region NBL Type 2, Hymek Type 3 diesel-hydraulic locomotives, Swindon and Gloucester cross-country diesel multiple units (DMUs). Today, the line is operated by a variety of preserved steam and diesel locomotives and DMUs. Most of these are typical of GWR branch lines in Somerset or of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (SDJR). Among the types based on the railway are examples of GWR 4575 and 5100 class 2-6-2Ts and a Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway 7F Class 2-8-0. A unique experiment has been to convert a GWR 5101 Class 2-6-2T into a small 2-6-0 numbered 9351. Diesels include Hymek and Western diesel- hydraulics. Most trains are formed from British Rail Mark 1 coaches painted in a chocolate and cream livery, based on the most familiar one used by the GWR but with WSR crests. The WSRA owned and operated Quantock Belle fine dining train is also formed from BR Mark 1 coaches, but each is painted in a livery reminiscent of Pullman cars and also named. There are also a number of freight wagons, some of which are used for engineering purposes or in a demonstration heritage freight train that is used on special occasions. Films and television Several films and television programmes have been shot on the railway: * A Hard Day's Night (1964) featured The Beatles and was filmed in 1964 at London Marylebone station and on the Minehead branch, much of it in and around Crowcombe. *The Belstone Fox (1973), a children's film, partly shot along the line near Crowcombe (village), chronicling the life of a fox much smarter than the dogs that hunt him. * The Flockton Flyer (1977‚Äì78) was a children's television drama series about a preserved railway that was filmed on the West Somerset Railway shortly after it reopened. * The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988), a BBC television mini-series was filmed at Crowcombe Heathfield. * The Land Girls (1997) was filmed on the railway and Crowcombe Heathfield featured as Bamford station. *Casualty (2013) the BBC One medical- based soap opera has used the line since shooting its first scenes in December 2013. Heritage organisations  Although the railway is operated by the West Somerset Railway Company (WSR plc) based at Minehead, it is supported by a number of voluntary and charitable organisations. The West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA) was formed alongside the WSR plc in 1971, to reopen the line. Based at Bishops Lydeard, it is a major shareholder of the plc. It has workshops at Williton and owns two locomotives (4500 Class 4561 and Manor Class No.7821 Ditcheat Manor) and shares in others. It also owns the Quantock Belle dining train and Hawksworth Saloon which operate on the line. The West Somerset Steam Railway Trust (WSRT) was set up in 1972 to operate the summer steam trains alongside the West Somerset Railway plc's commuter service. It had little to do once the railway became a purely seasonal heritage line but, in 1984 to coincide with the GW150 celebrations, was revived for education and historical research into the Minehead branch, and now has a small museum at Blue Anchor. The Trust's restored GWR sleeping carriage is on display in the Gauge Museum at Bishops Lydeard, and the Trust is presently restoring a GWR 'Toplight' coach which will be the first in a set of historic coaches on the West Somerset Railway. The Trust is administered by five voluntary directors. In early 2007, the Trust embarked on a project to restore two rakes of GWR coaches for use on the West Somerset Railway. Some of these were already on the railway, but others will be brought from abroad. The first of these, No 6705, was acquired from Steamtown USA. It returned to England, and after initial works at Crewe, is now at Williton for completion. The Diesel and Electric Preservation Group (DEPG) is based at Williton, where they use the old goods shed and a newer building as workshops for their fleet of five ex- Western Region diesel locomotives: Class 14 9526; Class 35s 7017 and 7018; Class 47 1661; and Class 52 1010. Williton is also the base for a number of privately owned locomotives which are maintained by the DEPG. The Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust (S&DRT;) is based at , and promotes the education and preservation of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It owns S&DJR; 7F 2-8-0 number 88, which is part of the WSR's regular operational fleet under a separate lease agreement. They have developed a workshop and yard at Washford, where they hold and restore a number of former S&DJR; goods wagons and coaches, as well as \\"Kilmersdon\\", a Peckett 0-4-0ST locomotive.

Reverberation of the room After determining the best dimensions of the room, using the modal density criteria, the next step is to find the correct reverberation timeMeasuring Reverberation Time RT60. The most appropriate reverberation time depends on the use of the room. Times about 1.5 to 2 seconds are needed for opera theaters and concert halls. For broadcasting and recording studios and conference rooms, values under one second are frequently used. The recommended reverberation time is always a function of the volume of the room.

This system gives a large acoustic absorption at low frequencies (under 500 Hz) and reduces at high frequencies to compensate for the typical absorption by people, lateral surfaces, ceilings, etc. See also *Acoustic board *Acoustic space *Acoustics *Anechoic room *Architectural acoustics *Digital room correction *Noise control *Reverberation *Sound proofing *Whispering gallery Notes References Acoustics Building engineering ","title":"Room acoustics"},{"id":"248608","title":"Rie Tanaka"},{"id":"248609","text":"Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) is one of four business segments of Raytheon Technologies.

Schoepen was a versatile entertainer, entrepreneur, singer-songwriter, guitarist, comedian, actor, and professional whistler, as well as the founder and former director of the amusement park Bobbejaanland. His musical career flourished from 1948 until the first half of the 1970s. He sold more than five million copies from his repertoire of 482 songs, which extended from Twang, cabaret, instrumental film music, chansons, country, to folk and vocal music.\\"Schoepen Trump\\", Knack Focus Magazine, 14 February 2007.Bobbejaan Schoepen, a Flemish entertainer ‚Äì Histories documentary, 4 January 2001 (Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep). Born in Boom, Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium, he worked his way up from a working-class environment to become one of the 200 richest people in Belgium.Verduyn, Ludwig. \\"De 200 rijkste Belgen\\", Uitgeverij Van Halewyck Leuven, 2000. Schoepen married Dutch former opera singer and photographer's model Josephina (Jos√©e) Jongen on 18 May 1961. They have five children: Robert (\\"Bob Jr.\\", 1962), Myriam (1963), Jacky (1964), Peggy (1968), and Tom (1970). His son Tom became his manager in Belgium. Early musical period Modest Schoepen grew up in a smithy in Boom, Antwerp. His career started in the late 1930s when he and his sister Liesje performed vaudeville shows in the surrounding villages, going around with the hat collecting money afterwards. He had his first audition for radio, in 1944 in Brussels. In 1943 he undertook classical guitar instruction with guitarist Frans De Groodt (1892‚Äì1990). =Musical and political debut= That same year he had a memorable debut performance in the Ancienne Belgique of Brussels. In front of a full house he sang the South-African song, \\"Mama, ek wil 'n man h√©\\". Nee mamma, n√©e, 'n Duitseman, die wil ek nie. Want Schweinefleisch dit lus ek nie\\" (\\"Mommy, I want a husband. No mommy no, I don't want a German 'cause I don't like pig meat.\\") The song was perceived as being anti-German, provoking a few Nazis who were present at the show to take him away. The South African song is making reference to a 'German man'. The Ancienne Belgique was closed for three weeks. Shortly thereafter he was forced to go work in Germany. As an alternative he chose to sing for the Flemish workers doing compulsory labor. For this he was locked up for three months in the Dossin barracks in Mechelen from October 1944, without a hearing or a trial. =Two Boys and Two Guitars= In 1945 he formed a duo with Kees Brug, a young man from his own village, with the name of \\"Two Boys and Two Guitars\\". They performed impersonations, poetry, South-African songs, and country music from Calais to Amsterdam, all with plenty of room for improvisation and adventure. The name \\"Bobbejaan\\" comes from the South-African song, \\"Bobbejaan klim die berg\\" (\\"Baboon Climbs the Mountain\\"). Schoepen took it as his artist name in 1945 or 1946. =Performing to the allied forces= In 1947 he came into contact with Jacques Kluger. Kluger asked Schoepen to entertain the American and Canadian troops during the Nuremberg Trials, and in Frankfurt and Berlin. Kluger was pleased to receive an unexpected, flattering letter from Major Mearker, and contracted Schoepen to go on tour in Germany for several months. In Berlin, which was still partly in ruins, his floor shows were also attended by the American general and military governor Lucius D. Clay, who asked him for two additional performances. These tours would further stimulate his country music tendencies. Bobbejaan in Grand Ole Opry, 1953 =First hit record and Indonesian tour= In between these shows, Schoepen also gave occasional performances in his own country. While he initially did not wish to sing in Dutch, Kluger convinced him to record 'a Flemish record'. Schoepen's first recordings followed, and in 1948 \\"De Jodelende Fluiter\\" (\\"The Yodeling Whistler\\") became Schoepen's first hit. His breakthrough in the Netherlands also happened that year. Among his many performances, he was frequently asked to guest-star in the Netherlands. Bobbejaan soon became the right man to work for the benefit of the Dutch. In 1949 he went on tour for the Dutch troops in Indonesia, performing 127 shows over the course of three months. He was decorated for courage and self-sacrifice by the Dutch government because he also performed for troops near the front line. Five days after returning home he began a 220-day tour through Belgium, playing nostalgic songs, such as the tried and true \\"De lichtjes van de Schelde\\" (\\"The Lights of the Scheldt\\") (1952), which is still an evergreen in Belgium today, Bobbejaan Schoepen quickly became one of the most popular artists in Flanders. International tours and success Bobbejaan Schoepen and Jacques Brel, 1955 Schoepen toured in at least twenty different countries, together with artists such as Josephine Baker, Caterina Valente, Gilbert B√©caud, and Toots Thielemans (who was a guitarist in his band in 1951). He is one of the first Europeans (excluding the British) to have appeared at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, one of the most important centers of country music in the United States. In 1953 he played there three times with Roy Acuff (1903‚Äì1992). There was one performance with the country singer Red Foley (1910‚Äì1968) in Springfield, Missouri. The American country singer, Tex Williams, a Western swing performer, would later release a cover of Schoepen's \\"Fire and Blisters\\" in the US (1974).The Official Biography of Bobbejaan Schoepen ‚Äì Folklife Chronicles (Flanders Cultural Studies), April‚ÄìJune 2006 =1954 tours= In 1954 there followed a three-month European tour through Germany, Iceland, and Denmark, which concluded with a few months of performances in the Folies Berg√®re in Brussels. Syd Fox was Schoepen's manager in Iceland and Denmark. When Jacques Brel performed the opening act in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels in January 1955, Schoepen already had the status of an international vedette in his own country. He was chosen as the best Flemish singer by the broadcasting company NIR (former VRT), for which he received the \\"Grand Prize for Flemish Gramophone Recording.\\" That autumn he toured with his show for a month through Germany then three months through the Congo. =1957 tours= In 1957 he again went to New York, where he was asked to make a guest-appearance on the famous Ed Sullivan Show. He recorded albums at RCA Records with the producer Steve Sholes. Sholes offered him a contract to promote his record, by visiting radio stations in the US for three months, under the name \\"Bobby John\\". This tour was intended to promote his recent releases, and in the meantime he was to produce new songs. But Schoepen, who had already been on tour almost constantly for ten years, and had contractual obligations in Europe, was increasingly looking for a place to settle down (this would become Bobbejaanland). He decided no longer to pursue his success in the US. That same month he became the last-minute Belgian representative at the second Eurovision Song Contest 1957. He was rushed by his manager Jacques Kluger from the US to Germany in order to take part in the event. This performance was memorable for having featured a whistling solo. Schoepen is also rumoured not to have known which song he was to perform at the Contest until he arrived, only rehearsing his entry a few days before performance. The song that was finally chosen was the lightly poetic \\"Straatdeuntje\\" ('Street Tune'). Belgium tied for eighth place with the Swiss.Eurovision Song Contest 1957 =1958 tours= A year later in 1958, Kluger secured Schoepen a place in the \\"Royal Variety Show\\" in England, a yearly gala for the Queen Mother (Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon). After the show, his local manager Jack Heath let him hear the first golden Australian hit in the US, \\"A Pub with No Beer\\" by Slim Dusty, and Schoepen decided to make a Dutch, German, and English cover of it. In 1960, \\"Ich steh an der Bar und ich habe kein Geld\\" stayed on the hit lists for thirty weeks in Germany; it also became a number-one hit in Austria. The Flemish version, \\"Caf√© zonder bier\\" dates from 1959, and that year it stood for five months at number one on the hit parade.Vlaamse hitparade 1959  It later became a golden oldie. =Other hits and tours= His German versions of \\"Een hutje op de Heide\\" (\\"Little cottage on the Heath\\") and \\"Kili Watch\\" (originally by The Cousins) also did very well (among other reasons because of the German film, ', 1961). Schoepen toured frequently in Germany and Austria with Caterina Valente (1955) and Dalida (1961), among others. This earned him many new, interesting contracts. In 1961 he became one of the top musical acts at the Berlin Film Festival, where he brought down the house at the Deutschlandhalle with his crazy whistling acts.Bobbejaan Schoepen During the 1960s, Camillo Felgen, Heino, and James Last, among others, would catapult his evergreen \\"Ik heb eerbied voor jouw grijze haren\\" (\\"I Respect Your Grey Hair\\") into a huge European hit, which has sold more than three million copies. In 1961, Caterina Valente also released a version of \\"In de schaduw van de mijn\\" (\\"In the Shadow of the [Coal] Mine\\") in Italy, under the title \\"Amice Miei\\", and in 1965 Richard Anthony sang a French and Spanish version \\"Ik heb me dikwijls afgevraagd\\" (Je me suis souvent demand√©) into the international charts. In 1965 it earned Schoepen, who wrote the music, an artistic 'Diploma of the Croix d'Honneur' in Paris.\\"Education Artistique, dipl√¥me de Croix d'Honneur de Chevalier\\". (30 June 1965 by the \\"Acad√©mie Nationale Artistique Litt√©raire et Scientifque, Paris\\" (no 5177). In 1967, ZDF-Germany decided to produce a musical television film in which he plays a series of his hits. The film was partially recorded in the Barrandov Studios in Prague, in Kempen and in Bobbejaanland, which at the time was still without attractions.‚ÄúBobbejaanland‚Äù filmproduction ZDF ‚Äî Regie: Vladimir Sis, 1967. During the sixties and seventies, he was a regular visitor to the United States, where he took up with actor Roy Rogers, Nudie Cohn (the fashion designer of Elvis, Johnny Cash and others), and Tex Williams, the founding father of western swing. The foursome occasionally performed together in local clubs.TV-show \\"30 jaar Bobbejaan\\" (1978) ‚Äì BRT Tours with a circus tent: 1958‚Äì1961 In 1958, Schoepen purchased a big circus tent to be able to tour more efficiently in his own country. Doing so freed him from having to deal with music venue owners, who were asking for ever-increasing rental prices and did not always have appropriate space for his program. He took over the two- master circus tent from the Tondeur family, who were finding it difficult to keep their performances profitable. Schoepen was handed the organizational reins and the circus again began to flourish. The day before a show he would promote the show himself at the designated location, sometimes in his own bizarre manner. An American circus stunt team came to Brussels on the occasion of the world exhibition, Expo 58; it was a private endeavor led by Casey Tibbs. But because of the excessively long distance to the actual Expo events, and the persistent bad weather, they went bankrupt. They could no longer afford to care for their fifty horses and so the team had return to the US. Tibbs had no choice but to give away some of the equipment, and among other things he sold Zorro's horse‚Äînamed Midnight, from the Zorro television series‚Äîto Bobbejaan Schoepen. He used the horse for many years for stunts in his shows and as an attraction during his cavalcades, but the horse stepped on an exposed electricity cable and died. In 1959, Schoepen bought a new circus tent. It had room for 900 people and could be expanded to accommodate a capacity of 1,200. These tours came to an end as soon as Bobbejaanland opened its doors in 1961. Using a circus tent for concert tours was unique for its time. Film Between 1950 and 1967 he acted in five musical film productions: two Belgian, two German, and one German-Czech. In 1962 he played the leading role in the absurd comedy, At the Drop of a Head (alias De Ordannans), together with leaders of the Flemish film scene: Ann Peterson, Yvonne Lex, Denise Deweerdt, Nand Buyl, and Tony Bell. The Dutch and English versions were recorded on the set at the same time. Schoepen was not pleased with this particular adventure into the world of film: \\"The takes were chaotic and they fired two different directors. Jef Bruyninckx (alias, De Witte) had to solve everything.\\"The Bobbejaan Story\\". HUMO. 5 November 1964. In 1999, the Belgian cult-rock band, Dead Man Ray, toured through Belgium and the Netherlands with the film. For Daan Stuyven (Daan) and Rudy Trouv√© (ex-dEUS), it is also an ode to the sometimes misunderstood)artistic versatility that characterized Schoepen the artist: :A true professional who was able to turn his jazzy country-guitar playing, his deep, angelic voice and his wacky sense of humor into a trademark and later into an amusement park.Dead Man Ray Humo 1999 : Bobbejaanland (cabaret period) It was never Schoepen's intention to build an amusement park; the current park arose from his musical career.Klara.be ‚Äì Bobbejaan is back ‚Äì Bobbejaan en Daan After nearly 15 years of constant touring, he began thinking about a place to settle down. In 1959, he bought a 30 hectare, marshy domain in Lichtaart-Kasterlee, called the Abroek. There he built a theater with nearly 1000 seats and created a 2.2 kilometer beach. This was to become Bobbejaanland, a name coined by his manager, Jacques Kluger. On 31 December 1961, Bobbejaanland was officially opened by Bobbejaan Schoepen and his wife Jos√©e, with whom he developed the park into his life's work. During the high season, Schoepen himself performed from two to five concerts per day. Artists from the Belgian, Dutch, and German cabaret-world performed there as well, though not during Schoepen's own program. Entrepreneurship Bobbejaanland evolved from 1975 onwards into a fully fledged amusement park. Schoepen focused his attention solely on the business aspect of the park, slowly pushing his musical career into the background. His performances became a rarity but Bobbejaanland, which he operated with his family, developed into one of the top amusement parks in the Benelux region. In the mid-80s the shows became more streamlined, and oriented toward a more international audience. The amusement park finally dominated the cabaret, and the entrepreneur the artist. He did continue singing, albeit with more streamlined shows, which inevitably gave way to the routine of the amusement park. :At a certain point my performances no longer had anything artistic about them. I received a phone call from my wife five minutes before I had to go on stage: 'Two busses of Germans, one bus of Danes and three busses of Spaniards'. And then I adapted my show to suit them. There was no room for sentiment in Bobbejaanland. It was work, work, and more work in order to keep the business profitable. Sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. We employed four-hundred people who had to be paid every month. : Challenges Bobbejaanland, 1988 Bobbejaan Schoepen's life was not without its difficulties: he was thrown into prison twice during wartime, he lost his virtuoso whistling ability due to a surgical intervention, and in 1986 he underwent a serious heart operation. In 1999 he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer, which raised the issue of selling Bobbejaanland, his life's work. But he continued and, in the winter of 2003, a major investment of nearly 12 million euros was made on two unique rides (\\"Typhoon\\" and \\"Sledge Hammer\\"). That year, the Flemish consumer magazine Test-Aankoop conducted a comparative survey of 13 European amusement parks. Bobbejaanland was the most highly esteemed park in Belgium on almost every level, and in Europe it shared second place, together with Disneyland and the Parc Ast√©rix.Test-Aankoop magazine 477, June 2004 However, in April 2004, after preparing for more than three years, the family finally decided to sell the park. At that time Bobbejaanland employed 400 people and was taken over by Parques Reunidos, a Spanish-American amusement park group. It remained uncertain until the very last minute whether the founder would put his signature on the deal. Uncertainty over the future of amusement parks was ultimately decisive. The Schoepen family chose the more certain path, which also seemed evident to the founder. After the sale, when the news program Terzake on the Flemish Broadcast VRT asked him if he had chosen to take the big money, Schoepen answered, staring ahead blankly, \\"What am I going to do with all that money; I can only eat twice a day.\\" Schoepen was considered to be the artistic attraction of the park; his wife Jos√©e (the oldest of eighteen children) was a leading figure and the commercial backbone; and her sister Louise (Wies) was the solid foundation with respect to accounting and finances. :The key to the success of this family business is found in the loyalty within this triumvirate, as well as their work ethic, which was strengthened from the 1990s on by three of their five children. With the sale of the park, the last family business in the amusement park sector in Belgium disappeared. Schoepen and his wife lived on the domain together, until his death in May 2010. Comeback Schoepen recovered from his illness and was again engaged in music. In 2005 he gave four surprise performances at the literary festival Saint-Amour, where he again brought people his well-known \\"De lichtjes van de Schelde\\". The song dated from 1952 and since then has been covered many times by popular Flemish and Dutch artists such as Louis Neefs, Hans De Booij, Wannes Van de Velde, and recently by Will Tura and DAAN. In November 2006 at the Radio2 \\"Hall of Fame\\", the song was performed by Bobbejaan admirer Daan Stuyven. That month, with the efforts of his son Tom Schoepen, Bobbejaan Records was brought back to life. The record company was established in 1966 but lapsed following the success of Bobbejaanland. The label is now focused on releases centered on Bobbejaan Schoepen. =Award= On 13 February 2007, with much media attention, Schoepen received a Lifetime Achievement Award in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels for his successful career as a singer, musician, and for his pioneering work in Belgian music history.Lifetime Achievement Award ZAMU Awards Belgium. =Another album= After Bobbejaanland was sold, Schoepen focussed on his music career, resulting in the new album release Bobbejaan (Bobbejaan Records/PIAS) in May 2008, his first album in 35 years. The album was mixed at South Beach Studios in Miami.Face of Flanders: Bobbejaan, Flanders Today, June 2008. The idea for this project originated with music producer Firmin Michiels and the Dead Man Ray-tour in 1999, but the idea was shelved when Schoepen was diagnosed with cancer. In 2005, the idea was revived by Michiels (A&R;) and executive producer Tom Schoepen, who would concentrate fully on the production of Bob's voice recordings. Michiels was aware that Bobbejaan Schoepen could not just pick up where he left off and carry his show for a large audience: his top years were long past and the amusement park had inflicted too much damage on the singer. But slowly his credibility returned. The album was recorded with five Belgian musicians in Schoepen's living room; he would have to deal with various health issues throughout the recording sessions. The release in May 2008 immediately received broad attention from the TV-journals and other media.Bobbejaan is back ‚Äì Klara, May 2008 Final years and death In July 2008 he was inducted as the first European into the \\"Whistler's Hall of Fame\\", by the US International Whistlers Convention.http://www.klara.be/cm/klara/2.607/1.32478 In December 2009, an official compilation with 76 songs spanning 60 years of musical career was released: \\"The World of Bobbejaan ‚Äî Songbook\\" (Bobbejaan Records).

The Women's Land Army (WLA) was a British civilian organisation created during World War II so women could work in agriculture, reviving a disbanded World War One organisation and replacing men called up to the military. Women who worked for the WLA were commonly known as Land Girls. In effect the Land Army operated to place women with farms that needed workers, the farmers being their employers. They picked crops and did all the jobs that the men would do. Notable members include Joan Quennell, later a Member of Parliament. History As the prospect of war became increasingly likely, the government wanted to increase the amount of food grown within Britain. In order to grow more food, more help was needed on the farms and so the government started the Women's Land Army in July 1939. Though under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, it was given an honorary head ‚Äì Lady Denman. At first it asked for volunteers. This was supplemented by conscription, so that by 1944 it had over 80,000 members. Inez Jenkins, who had served as Lady Deman's assistant director during the establishment of the WLA served as Chief Administrative Officer until 1948. The last Chief of the WLA was Amy Curtis. The WLA lasted until its official disbandment on 21 October 1949. The majority of the Land Girls already lived in the countryside but more than a third came from London and the industrial cities of the north of England. A separate branch was set up in 1942 for forestry industry work, officially known as the Women's Timber Corps and with its members colloquially known as \\"Lumber Jills\\" ‚Äì this was disbanded in 1946.Emma Vickers, \\"'The Forgotten Army of the Woods': The Women's Timber Corps during the Second World War\\" Agricultural History Review (2011) 59#1 101‚Äì112.

Recognition Statue at the National Memorial Arboretum, Alrewas In December 2007, following campaigning by former Land Girl Hilda Gibson, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) announced that the efforts of the Women's Land Army and the Women's Timber Corps would be formally recognised with the presentation of a specially designed commemorative badge to the surviving members. The badge of honour was awarded in July 2008 to over 45,000 former Land Girls.

During the early modern period, Europeans thought of Cathay as a completely separate and distinct culture from China. As knowledge of East Asia increased, Cathay came to be seen as the same polity as China. The term \\"Cathay\\" became a poetic name for China. The name Cathay originates from the word Khitan (), the name of a nomadic people who founded the Liao dynasty which ruled much of today's Northern China from 916 to 1125, and who later migrated west after they were overthrown by the Jurchens to form the Qara Khitai (also known as the Western Liao) centered on today's Kyrgyzstan for another century thereafter. Originally, this name was the name applied by Central and Western Asians and Europeans to northern China; the name was also used in Marco Polo's book on his travels in China (he referred to southern China as Mangi). Odoric of Pordenone (d.1331) also writes about Cathay and the Khan in his travelbooks from his journey before 1330, perhaps 1321‚Äì1330.  History  On this 1570 map by Abraham Ortelius, Cataio is located inland of China (referring to today's Guangdong) and Chequan (Zhejiang), and borders on \\"Thebet\\" in the southwest and \\"Camul\\" in the west. There is also Mangi (between \\"Cataio\\" and Xanton (Shandong)). The objects in \\"Cataio\\" are based on Marco Polo's description and include the capital Cambalu, Xandu, and a marble bridge The term Cathay came from the name for the Khitans. A form of the name Cathai is attested in a Uyghur Manichaean document circa 1000.Wittfogel (1946), p. 1 The Khitans refer to themselves as Qidan, but in the language of the ancient Uyghurs the final -n or -≈Ñ became -y, and this form may be the source of the name Khitai for later Muslim writers. This version of the name was then introduced to medieval and early modern Europe via Muslim and Russian sources. The Khitans were known to Muslim Central Asia: in 1026, the Ghaznavid court (in Ghazna, in today's Afghanistan) was visited by envoys from the Liao ruler, he was described as a \\"QatƒÅ Khan\\", i.e. the ruler of QatƒÅ; QatƒÅ or QitƒÅ appears in writings of al-Biruni and Abu Said Gardezi in the following decades. The Persian scholar and administrator Nizam al-Mulk (1018‚Äì1092) mentions Khita and China in his Book on the Administration of the State, apparently as two separate countries (presumably, referring to the Liao and Song Empires, respectively). The name's currency in the Muslim world survived the replacement of the Khitan Liao dynasty with the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the early 12th century. When describing the fall of the Jin Empire to the Mongols (1234), Persian history described the conquered country as KhitƒÅy or Djerdaj KhitƒÅy (i.e., \\"Jurchen Cathay\\"). The Mongols themselves, in their Secret History (13th century) talk of both Khitans and Kara-Khitans. In about 1340 Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a merchant from Florence, compiled the Pratica della mercatura, a guide about trade in China, a country he called Cathay, noting the size of Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) and how merchants could exchange silver for Chinese paper money that could be used to buy luxury items such as silk.Spielvogel, Jackson J. (2011). Western Civilization: a Brief History, Boston: Wadsworth, Cencage Learning, p. 183, .See the following source for the title \\"Cathay and the Way Tither\\": Editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. \\"Francesco Balducci Pegolotti.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (online source). Accessed 6 September 2016. Words related to Khitay are still used in many Turkic and Slavic languages to refer to China. The ethnonym derived from Khitay in the Uyghur language for Han Chinese is considered pejorative by both its users and its referents; it also strongly connotes Uyghur nationalism. The Chinese Communist authorities have attempted to ban its use by the Uyghurs. Cathay and Mangi As European and Arab travelers started reaching the Mongol Empire, they described the Mongol-controlled Northern China as Cathay in a number of spelling variants. The name occurs in the writings of Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (c. 1180‚Äì1252) (as Kitaia), and William of Rubruck (c. 1220‚Äìc. 1293) (as Cataya or Cathaia).Wittfogel (1946), p. 2 Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, ibn Battuta, and Marco Polo all referred to Northern China as Cathay, while Southern China, ruled by the Song dynasty, was Mangi, Manzi, Chin, or Sin. The word Manzi (Ë†ªÂ≠ê) or Mangi is a derogatory term in Chinese meaning \\"barbarians of the south\\" (Man was used to describe unsinicised Southern China in its earlier periods), and would therefore not have been used by the Chinese to describe themselves or their own country, but it was adopted by the Mongols to describe the people and country of Southern China. The name for South China commonly used on Western medieval maps was Mangi, a term still used in maps in the 16th century.  Identifying China as Cathay  The division of China into northern and southern parts ruled by, in succession, the Liao, Jin and Mongol Yuan empires in the north, and the Song dynasty in the south, ended in the late 13th century with the conquest of southern China by the Mongol Yuan Empire. While Central Asia had long known China under names similar to Cathay, that country was known to the peoples of South-East Asia and India under names similar to China (cf. e.g. Cina in modern Malay). Meanwhile, in China itself, people usually referred to the realm in which they lived on the name of the ruling dynasty, e.g. Da Ming Guo (\\"the kingdom of the Great Ming\\"), or as the \\"Middle Kingdom\\" (Zhongguo ‰∏≠Âúã); see also Names of China for details. When the Portuguese reached South-East Asia (Afonso de Albuquerque conquering Malacca in 1511) and the southern coast of China (Jorge √Ålvares reaching the Pearl River estuary in 1513), they started calling the country by the name used in South and South-East Asia.Matteo Ricci, writing less than a century after the events, states: \\"Today the people of Cochin and the Siamese as well, from whom the Portuguese learned to call the empire China, call this country Cin\\". (Gallagher (1953), pp. 6‚Äì7) It was not immediately clear to the Europeans whether this China is the same country as Cathay known from Marco Polo. Therefore, it would not be uncommon for 16th- century maps to apply the label \\"China\\" just to the coastal region already well known to the Europeans (e.g., just Guangdong on Abraham Ortelius' 1570 map), and to place the mysterious Cathay somewhere inland. Gerardus Mercator's placing of the \\"Kingdom of Cathay\\" (Cathay Reg.) on the Pacific Coast north- east of China remained typical for a number of maps published in the decades to follow It was a small group of Jesuits, led by Matteo Ricci who, being able both to travel throughout China and to read, learned about the country from Chinese books and from conversation with people of all walks of life. During his first 15 years in China (1583‚Äì1598) Matteo Ricci formed a strong suspicion that Marco Polo's \\"Cathay\\" is simply the \\"Tatar\\" (i.e., Mongol) name for the country he was in, i.e. China. Ricci supported his arguments by numerous correspondences between Marco Polo's accounts and his own observations: * The River \\"Yangtze\\" divides the empire into two halves, with 9 provinces (\\"kingdoms\\") south of the river and 6 to the north; * Marco Polo's \\"Cathay\\" was just south of \\"Tartary\\", and Ricci learned that there was no other country between the Ming Empire and \\"Tartary\\" (i.e., the lands of Mongols and Manchus). * People in China had not heard of any place called \\"Cathay\\". Most importantly, when the Jesuits first arrived to Beijing 1598, they also met a number of \\"Mohammedans\\" or \\"Arabian Turks\\" ‚Äì visitors or immigrants from the Muslim countries to the west of China, who told Ricci that now they were living in the Great Cathay. This all made them quite convinced that Cathay is indeed China.Gallagher (trans.) (1953), pp. 311‚Äì312. Also, in p.7, Ricci and Trigault unambiguously state, \\"the Saracens, who live to the west, speak of it [China] as Cathay\\". China-based Jesuits promptly informed their colleagues in Goa (Portuguese India) and Europe about their discovery of the Cathay‚ÄìChina identity. This was stated e.g. in a 1602 letter of Ricci's comrade Diego de Pantoja, which was published in Europe along with other Jesuits' letters in 1605.Lach & Van Kley (1993), p. 1565. Pantoja's letter appeared in Relaci√≥n de la entrade de algunos padres de la Compania de Iesus en la China (1605) The Jesuits in India, however, were not convinced, because, according to their informants (merchants who visited the Mughal capitals Agra and Lahore), Cathay ‚Äì a country that could be reached via Kashgar ‚Äì had a large Christian population, while the Jesuits in China had not found any Christians there.Yule, pp. 534‚Äì535Lach & Kley (1993), pp. 1575‚Äì1577 A typical early 17th- century depiction of \\"Cataia\\" as China's northeastern neighbour. Jodocus Hondius, 1610 In retrospect, the Central Asian Muslim informants' idea of the Ming China being a heavily Christian country may be explained by numerous similarities between Christian and Buddhist ecclesiastical rituals ‚Äì from having sumptuous statuary and ecclesiastical robes to Gregorian chant ‚Äì which would make the two religions appear externally similar to a Muslim merchant.Gallagher, p. 500; Yule, pp. 551‚Äì552 This may also have been the genesis of the Prester John myth. To resolve the China‚ÄìCathay controversy, the India Jesuits sent a Portuguese lay brother, Bento de G√≥is on an overland expedition north and east, with the goal of reaching Cathay and finding out once and for all whether it is China or some other country. G√≥is spent almost three years (1603‚Äì1605) crossing Afghanistan, Badakhshan, Kashgaria, and Kingdom of Cialis with Muslim trade caravans. In 1605, in Cialis, he, too, became convinced that his destination is China, as he met the members of a caravan returning from Beijing to Kashgar, who told them about staying in the same Beijing inn with Portuguese Jesuits. (In fact, those were the same very \\"Saracens\\" who had, a few months earlier, confirmed it to Ricci that they were in \\"Cathay\\"). De G√≥is died in Suzhou, Gansu ‚Äì the first Ming China city he reached ‚Äì while waiting for an entry permit to proceed toward Beijing; but, in the words of Henry Yule, it was his expedition that made \\"Cathay... finally disappear from view, leaving China only in the mouths and minds of men\\".Henry Yule (1866), p. 530. Not convinced by the Jesuits, John Speed in 1626 follows Jodocus Hondius' layout: he shows the chain of Silk Road cities visited by de G√≥is (Cuchia, Chialis, Turfan, Camul) ‚Äì but has it directed not toward China's Shaanxi Sancii, as shows by de G√≥is, but toward the mysterious \\"Cathaya, the Chief Kingdome of Great Cam\\", northeast of China. Naturally, Cambalu and Xandu are shown in Cathay, while Shuntien (Beijing) is in China Ricci's and de Gois' conclusion was not, however, completely convincing for everybody in Europe yet. Samuel Purchas, who in 1625 published an English translation of Pantoja's letter and Ricci's account, thought that perhaps, Cathay still can be found somewhere north of China. In this period, many cartographers were placing Cathay on the Pacific coast, north of Beijing (Pekin) which was already well- known to Europeans. The borders drawn on some of these maps would first make Cathay the northeastern section of China (e.g. 1595 map by Gerardus Mercator), or, later, a region separated by China by the Great Wall and possibly some mountains and/or wilderness (as in a 1610 map by Jodocus Hondius, or a 1626 map by John Speed). J. J. L. Duyvendak hypothesized that it was the ignorance of the fact that \\"China\\" is the mighty \\"Cathay\\" of Marco Polo that allowed the Dutch governor of East Indies Jan Pieterszoon Coen to embark on an \\"unfortunate\\" (for the Dutch) policy of treating the Ming Empire as \\"merely another 'oriental' kingdom\\". (specifically pp. 185‚Äì186) Cathay is finally gone: this 1689 map by Giacomo Cantelli da Vignola from Modena identifies it (and Mangi) with China The last nail into the coffin of the idea of there being a Cathay as a country separate from China was, perhaps, driven in 1654, when the Dutch Orientalist Jacobus Golius met with the China-based Jesuit Martino Martini, who was passing through Leyden. Golius knew no Chinese, but he was familiar with Zij-i Ilkhani, a work by the Persian astronomer Nasir al- Din al-Tusi, completed in 1272, in which he described the Chinese (\\"Cathayan\\") calendar.van Dalen, Benno; Kennedy, E.S.; Saiyid, Mustafa K., \\"The Chinese- Uighur Calendar in Tusi's Zij-i Ilkhani\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichte der Arabisch-Islamischen Wissenschaften 11 (1997) 111‚Äì151 Upon meeting Martini, Golius started reciting the names of the 12 divisions into which, according to Nasir al-Din, the \\"Cathayans\\" were dividing the day ‚Äì and Martini, who of course knew no Persian, was able to continue the list. The names of the 24 solar terms matched as well. The story, soon published by Martini in the \\"Additamentum\\" to his Atlas of China, seemed to have finally convinced most European scholars that China and Cathay were the same. Even then, some people still viewed Cathay as distinct from China, as did John Milton in the 11th Book of his Paradise Lost (1667).\\"Why Did Milton Err on Two Chinas?\\" Y. Z. Chang, The Modern Language Review, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Jul., 1970), pp. 493‚Äì498. In 1939, Hisao Migo (, a Japanese botanist) published a paper describing Iris cathayensis (meaning \\"Chinese iris\\") in the Journal of the Shanghai Science Institute.  Etymological progression  # Below is the etymological progression from Khitan to Cathay as the word travelled westward: *Mongolian/Classical Mongolian: Qitad, –•—è—Ç–∞–¥ (Khyatad) *Uyghur: ÿÆŸâÿ™ÿßŸä (Xitay) *Persian: (khatƒÅy) *Kyrgyz: –ö—ã—Ç–∞–π (Kytai) *Kazakh: ŸÇŸâÿ™ÿßŸä, “ö—ã—Ç–∞–π, Qƒ±tay *Kazan Tatar: –ö—ã—Ç–∞–π (Qƒ±tay) *Russian: (Kitay) *Ukrainian: (Kytaj) *Belarusian: (Kitaj) *Bulgarian: (Kitaj) *Uzbek: –•–∏—Ç–æ–π (Xitoy) *Polish: Kitaj *Serbian: Kitaj (–ö–∏—Ç–∞–π) *Croatian: Kitaj *Medieval Latin: Cataya, Kitai *Italian: Catai *Spanish: Catay *Portuguese: Cataio or Catai *French, English, German, Dutch, Scandinavian: Cathay In many Turkic and Slavic languages a form of \\"Cathay\\" (e.g., , Kitay) remains the usual modern name for China. In Javanese, the word Í¶èÍ¶†Í¶ª (Katai, Kat√©) exists, (in Indonesian, transcription of King Jayabaya's prophecy) and it refers to 'East Asian', literally mean 'dwarf' or 'short- legged' in today's language.  Use in English  Travels in the Land of Kublai Khan by Marco Polo has a story called \\"The Road to Cathay\\". In the English language, the word Cathay was sometimes used for China, although increasingly only in a poetic sense, until the 19th century when it was completely replaced by \\"China\\". A person from Cathay (i.e., a Chinese person) was also written in English as a Cathayan or a Cataian. However the terms \\"China\\" and \\"Cathay\\" have histories of approximately equal length in English. The term is still used poetically. The Hong Kong flag bearing airline is named Cathay Pacific. In the names of organized entities Cathay is more prevalent as a proper noun in names, such as Cathay Dragon, Cathay Pacific Airways or Cathay Hotel. The flagship airline of Hong Kong is called as such because the founders envisioned that one day, the airline would cross the Pacific Ocean from China. Cathay Bank is a bank with multiple branches throughout the United States and overseas. Cathay Cineplex is a cinema operator in Singapore. Notes References * Karl A.

The paper was founded in 1930 as the Daily Worker by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). In 1945, ownership was transferred from the CPGB to an independent readers' co- operative, and it remains wholly owned by its readers. It was renamed the Morning Star in 1966. The paper describes its editorial stance as in line with Britain's Road to Socialism, the programme of the Communist Party of Britain.\\"Britain's Road to Socialism, the Communist Party of Britain programme ... underlies our paper's editorial stance.\\" People's Press Printing Society Annual Report 2009. Although the New Statesman has described it as \\"Britain's last communist newspaper\\", it prints contributions by writers from a variety of socialist, communist, social democratic, green and religious perspectives. Unlike many socialist newspapers, it does not concentrate on politics to the exclusion of other topics: the paper includes daily sports pages, arts reviews, a weekly crossword, a regular gardening column and a cookery spot (\\"The Commie Chef\\").  The Daily Worker (1930‚Äì1966) =Early years= Daily Worker delivery bag The Morning Star was founded in 1930 as the Daily Worker, the paper representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\\"The Papers of the Communist Party of Great Britain\\", The Archive hub, University of Manchester The first edition was produced on 1 January 1930\\"Help for Researchers: Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Twentieth Century\\", British Library website from the offices of the newspaper in Tabernacle Street, London, by eight Party members including Kay Beauchamp and Tom Wintringham. In January 1934, the Daily Worker offices moved to Cayton Street, off City Road. The first eight-page Daily Worker was produced on 1 October 1935. =Second World War= On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain spoke to the nation on the BBC, at which time he announced the formal declaration of war between Britain and Nazi Germany. Daily Worker editor J. R. Campbell, backed by his political ally, Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt, sought to portray the conflict against Hitler as a continuation of the anti-fascist fight.James Eaton and David Renton, The Communist Party of Great Britain since 1920, Basingstoke: Pallgrave, 2002, pp.69‚Äì70 This contradicted the position of the Comintern in the aftermath of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact (which became CPGB policy on 3 October) that the war was a struggle between rival imperialist powers, and Campbell was removed as editor as a result, being replaced by William Rust.Bill Jones, The Russia complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977, p.38 . The paper accused the British government's policies of being \\"not to rescue Europe from fascism, but to impose British imperialist peace on Germany\\" before attacking the Soviet Union. The newspaper responded to the assassination of Leon Trotsky by a Soviet agent with an article on 23 August 1940, entitled \\"A Counter Revolutionary Gangster Passes\\", written by former editor Campbell. The paper criticised Sir Walter Citrine after his meeting in Paris with French Labour Minister Charles Pomaret in December 1939. Time said of the events following the meeting, \\"Minister Pomaret clamped down on French labour with a set of drastic wage-&-hour decrees and Sir Walter Citrine agreed to a proposal by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon that pay rises in Britain be stopped\\". Citrine sued the Daily Worker for libel after it accused him and his associates of \\"plotting with the French Citrines to bring millions of Anglo-French Trade Unionists behind the Anglo-French imperialist war machine\\"; the publisher pleaded the British press equivalent of 'fair comment'. Citrine alleged, in response to his lawyer's questioning, that the Daily Worker received ¬£2,000 pounds per month from \\"Moscow\\", and that Moscow directed the paper to print anti-war stories. During this period, when the Soviet Union had a non- aggression pact with Germany, the Daily Worker ceased to attack Nazi Germany.Editorial \\"The 'Daily Worker\\", Manchester Guardian, 22 January 1941, reprint on The Guardian website. On 21 January 1941, publication of the newspaper was suppressed by the Home Secretary in the wartime coalition, Herbert Morrison (a Labour Party MP). It had repeatedly ignored a July 1940 warning that its pacifist line contravened Defence Regulation 2D, which made it an offence to 'systematically to publish matter calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war'. A Scottish edition of the Daily Worker was produced from its plant in Glasgow from 11 November 1940. On 16 April 1941, the Daily Worker offices at Cayton Street were totally destroyed by fire during the Blitz. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 to the former Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street (whence the old Communist Party Sunday Worker, edited by William Paul and Tom Wintringham, had been published from 15 March 1925 until 1929). New offices were acquired in 1945, at a former brush-makers' warehouse at 75 Farringdon Road, for the sum of ¬£48,000. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the situation changed; British Communists became fervent supporters of the war. For the rest of the war, the paper was a strong supporter of the British war effort, and campaigned to organise a \\"Second Front\\" in Europe to assist the Soviet Union.Andrew Thorpe, The British Communist Party and Moscow, 1920‚Äì43, Manchester University Press, 2000. , p.268. The government's ban on the Daily Worker was lifted in September 1942, following a campaign supported by Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, and Professor J. B. S. Haldane. A \\"Lift the ban\\" conference at Central Hall, Westminster on 21 March 1942 was attended by over 2,000 delegates. A key part of the campaign was to secure Labour Party support (Herbert Morrison was a fierce opponent of the Daily Worker). On 26 May 1942, after a heated debate, the Labour Party carried a resolution declaring the Government must lift the ban on the Daily Worker. The Daily Worker welcomed the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, editorialising \\"The employment of the new weapon on a substantial scale should expedite the surrender of Japan\\".Lawrence S. Wittner, The Struggle Against The Bomb: Volume One, One World Or None. Stanford, California, Stanford University Press, p.172 David Widgery, The Left in Britain, 1956‚Äì68, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976, p.100. The paper also applauded the bombing of Nagasaki, and called for the use of additional atomic bombs against the Japanese. Since September 1945 the paper has been owned and published by a readers' co-operative, the People's Press Printing Society, which operates on a one-vote-per-shareholder basis. =Postwar= The Daily Worker reached its peak circulation after the war, although precise circulation figures are disputed ‚Äì from 100,000 to 122,000 to 140,000Obituary: Mary Rosser-Hicks, Daily Telegraph 10 January 2011 and even 500,000. The Daily Worker was fully supportive of the show trials in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria in the late 1940s, as well as the split with Tito and Yugoslavia in 1948.Keith Laybourn Marxism in Britain: Dissent, Decline and Re-emergence 1945-c.2000, Abingdon: Routledge, 2006, p.43 In 1956, the Daily Worker suppressed correspondent Peter Fryer's reports from the Hungarian revolution, which were favourable to the uprising. The paper denounced the attempted revolution as a \\"white terror\\", invoking the Horthy regime and earlier 1919‚Äì1921 period. By the late 1950s the paper was down to just one sheet of four pages. The last edition of the Daily Worker was published on Saturday 23 April 1966. An editorial in that final issue declared: > \\"On Monday this newspaper takes its greatest step forward for many years. It > will be larger, it will be better and it will have a new name.... During its > 36 years of life our paper has stood for all that is best in British > working-class and Socialist journalism. It has established a reputation for > honesty, courage and integrity. It has defended trade unionists, tenants, > pensioners. It has consistently stood for peace. It has always shown the > need for Socialism. Let all Britain see the Morning Star, the inheritor of a > great tradition and the herald of a greater future\\". In February every year between 1950 and 1954, the Daily Worker held a rally at Harringay Arena in Harringay, north London,\\"Archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB)\\". Retrieved on 5 December 2015. attended by about 10,000 people. Guests were entertained by tableaux set to music. Paul Robeson also sent recorded messages which were played during the rallies. Morning Star (1966‚Äìpresent) =History= The first edition of the Morning Star appeared on Monday, 25 April 1966. South African exile Sarah Carneson worked for the newspaper in the late 1960s.\\"Liberation Hero and Ex-Star Worker Sarah Carneson Dies\\" People's Daily Morning Star (6 November 2015). Until 1974, the paper was subsidised by the Soviet government with direct cash contributions, and from 1974 onwards was indirectly supported by daily bulk orders from Moscow. Its Chief Executive from 1975 was Mary Rosser. By the late 1970s, the paper and the CPGB were beginning to come into conflict with one another, as the Eurocommunist trend in the CPGB grew, while the Morning Star at the time retained a pro-Soviet stance and opposed Eurocommunism.Christine F. Collette and Keith Laybourn Modern Britain Since 1979: A Reader, London: I.B. Tauris, 2003, p.185 An editorial in The Guardian, however, reported in 1977 that the paper was giving coverage to dissidents in Czechoslavakia and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc to the consternation of about a third of CPGB members who wanted a reversal to a strictly pro-Kremlin line. \\"The Morning Star is open for genuine debate about the future of the Left\\", it asserted. A demonstration outside the East German embassy against the imprisonment of reformist Communist Rudolf Bahro was organised by the Morning Star that year. Also in 1977, editor Tony Chater persuaded the Labour government to begin running advertisements in the newspaper, previously absent because of a lack of audited circulation figures. In December 1981, when the Polish Solidarity trade union movement was suppressed and martial law declared, the paper criticised the Executive Committee of the party for condemning the acts of the (then-Communist) Polish government.Laybourn Marxism in Britain, p.116 In 1982, the Morning Star attacked the attitudes of Marxism Today, the party's monthly journal, which was controlled by the Eurocommunists.John Callaghan The Far Left in British Politics, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987, p.186 The newspaper attracted some wider media attention in September 1981 when the BBC paid to place six advertisements for its Russian-language service in the Morning Star, which was one of the few English language newspapers that the USSR government allowed to be circulated in the country. Four of these advertisements were printed as agreed, but the last two of the six were not printed. A spokesman for the newspaper said that the advertising department had not properly consulted with other teams before making the agreement, and that the BBC's broadcasts were part of Cold War propaganda.BBC World Service ‚Äì Britain's Daily Papers ‚Äì The Morning Star, broadcast on 26 November 1981, retrieved 23 July 2016 The paper supported the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) during the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì1985, but the party had become critical of NUM leader Arthur Scargill's strategy towards the end of the strike.Laybourn Marxism in Britain, p.122 Meanwhile, in March 1984, the CPGB Executive Committee (EC) issued a seven- page document which was heavily critical of editor Tony Chater, in particular because he had refused to print an article which commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the death of Lenin. The EC put forward candidates to challenge those loyal to Chater at the 1984 AGM of the PPPS and called for Chater's replacement. He was expelled from the CPGB in January 1985, along with the assistant editor, David Whitfield, reportedly because the attempts to remove him as editor had failed. A statement by the party's EC asserted that the paper was \\"being systematically used to attack and undermine congress policy, support factional activities in the party, and help sectarian minority groupings in their opposition to the party majority\\". Collette and Laybourn Modern Britain Since 1945, p.190 In June 1985, however, AGMs of the PPPS held in Glasgow, Manchester and London voted by about 60 to 40% for candidates backed by the management committee of the Morning Star.Callaghan, p.187 Chater remained editor of the paper until 1995 when he retired.Laybourn Marxism in Britain, p.160 Control of the newspaper passed from the Eurocommunist leadership of the CPGB to the newly established pro-Soviet Communist Party of Britain (CPB). On the day before the Berlin Wall began to be demolished in 1989, under a headline reading \\"GDR unveils reforms package\\", the newspaper commented that \\"The German Democratic Republic is awakening\\", and quoting material supplied by East Germany‚Äôs ruling Socialist Unity Party: \\"A revolutionary people‚Äôs movement has set in motion a process of serious upheaval ... The aim is dynamically to give socialism more democracy\\". Soviet bulk orders ended abruptly in 1989 (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had still been buying 6,000 copies every day), and the termination of this order, with only a week's notice, was the cause of \\"huge financial disruption\\". In the 1990s, the publication's circulation fell to 7,000, following the end of the Soviet bulk sales. There were tensions between different CPB factions over control of the paper, and in particular over the successor of Tony Chater as editor. Chief Executive Mary Rosser favoured the news editor, Paul Corry (also her son-in-law); the staff and by the unions favoured Chater's deputy, John Haylett, who was installed in February 1995. In 1998 many of its workers ‚Äì then earning ¬£10,500 a year and with no raise for 11 years ‚Äì went on strike. These strikes were provoked by the sacking by Rosser of Haylett for \\"gross misconduct\\".\\"Morning Star Strike (Channel 4 News)\\". 28 October 2006.

Retrieved on 5 December 2015 ‚Äì via YouTube. This paper was discontinued before the end of the decade. Haylett was eventually reinstated as editor and the protests stopped, as the circulation saw a moderate increase. \\"Our political relationship is still with the Communist Party of Britain\\", he said in 2005, pointing out that only about 10% of readers were members of the party, \\"but now we represent a broad movement\\". Although the paper is normally published from Monday to Saturday, the Morning Star was issued on 13 September 2015, its first ever Sunday edition, to cover the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party. =Editorial policy= The newspaper describes itself as \\"a reader-owned co-operative and unique as a lone socialist voice in a sea of corporate media\\". Successive annual general meetings of the People's Press Printing Society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on Britain's Road to Socialism, the programme of the Communist Party of Britain.People's Press Printing Society Limited 61st Annual Report for Annual General Meeting June 2006, p. 4 On international issues, the paper advocates a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and calls for Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories. It was the only daily paper in Britain to oppose the 1999 Kosovo War, denouncing military intervention by NATO, and consistently defended Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, according to other publications.See for example The newspaper also opposed the Iraq War. On Northern Ireland, the paper takes a pro-Irish nationalism line. News reports from Northern Ireland are described as \\"By Our Foreign Desk\\". In its masthead, the paper asserts that it supports peace and socialism. It is Eurosceptic, and supported the No2EU platform in the 2009 European Parliament election. The paper was also supportive of Britain's vote to leave the EU, saying that \\"Anybody who supports the election of a Corbyn government with a mandate to end austerity, extend public ownership, redistribute wealth and restructure our economy in the interests of working people needs to explain how this agenda can be implemented in the framework of an EU that bans so much of it\\", criticising the referendum campaign as being headed by \\"reactionary zealots\\" such as Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. The Morning Star and the Spectator were the only publications to campaign for an Exit vote in the 1975 referendum. Tony Benn (described as \\"the de facto leader of the \\"Out\\" campaign\\") campaigned alongside the paper. It is critical of the upper or ruling classes. It defends peaceful protests, civil disobedience and industrial action by workers to improve working conditions and wages. The Morning Star is concerned with environmental issues and supports environment campaigning groups; it supports unilateral nuclear disarmament. The paper advocates a vote for the Labour Party in most seats, except for the handful in which the Communist Party of Britain has a candidate. The Morning Star retains \\"its reputation for bone-headed Stalinism\\", according to Paul Anderson, a former editor of the left-wing Tribune weekly. \\"It runs articles extolling the virtues of single-party \\"socialist\\" states on a regular basis ‚Äì North Korea, Cuba, China, Vietnam. Its default position on just about everything happening in the world is that anything any Western power supports ‚Äì but particularly the United States ‚Äì must be opposed, which has led to it cheering on Putin, Hamas, Assad and a lot of other real nasties\\". In December 2016, the newspaper was criticised by Labour MPs led by John Woodcock (\\"one of the fiercest critics of British government inaction over aid to the region\\", according to The Huffington Post) for its description of the imminent fall of Aleppo to Syrian government forces in a front-page headline as a \\"liberation\\". Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop tweeted: \\"Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators \\"liberating\\" Aleppo. Absolute disgrace\\". Fellow Labour MPs joining in the criticism were Stephen Doughty, Angela Smith, Ian Austin, Mike Gapes, Jess Phillips, Toby Perkins and Wes Streeting. Conservative MP George Osborne and Guardian writer Owen Jones also attacked the paper's headline. However, the paper rejected the criticism, stating that \\"from a purely technical point of view, when a sovereign government reclaims territory previously held by enemy forces, that‚Äôs called \\"liberation\\" whether we like the outcome or not\\", while Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German, and political commentator Peter Oborne defended the Star reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he \\"disagreed\\" with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and \\"a political settlement in Syria\\". However, he refused to say he would never buy or read the paper again, saying; \\"Listen, I buy lots of newspapers. I frequently disagree profoundly with headlines, even in The Guardian, the Telegraph, the Mail, and so on. Does it mean I won‚Äôt buy them, or read them? Of course not.\\" =Contributors and staff= Contributor Jeremy Corbyn In the first years of the twenty-first century, the paper has carried contributions from Uri Avnery, John Pilger, Green activist Derek Wall, ex-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Green MP Caroline Lucas, former MP George Galloway (Respect), the cartoonist Martin Rowson, and many trade union general secretaries. Features are contributed by writers from a range of socialist, social democratic, green and religious perspectives. Despite this, according to then editor John Haylett in 2005: \\"things that happened in the Soviet Union 70 years ago are still being used as a stick to beat the Morning Star.\\" On 1 January 2009, Bill Benfield took over as editor of the Morning Star. John Haylett, who had been editor since 1995, took up the post of political editor. Benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production, but suffered from ill health.https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-3a32-OBITUARY- BILL-BENFIELD#.Wb2h7bKGO00 In May 2012, Richard Bagley became editor of the Morning Star,https://www.communist-party.org.uk/communications/morning- star/1646-new-editor-richard-bagley-on-the-future-of-the-morning-star.html having already worked at the paper in various positions since 2001. In July 2014, he stepped down as editor, with Ben Chacko becoming acting editor,\\"Tributes paid to departing Star stalwarts\\", Morning Star (website), 28 July 2014 a position in which Chacko was confirmed in May 2015.\\"New editor hailed by leading lefties\\", Morning Star (website), 23 May 2015 The newspaper \\"is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media\\", said (then backbencher Labour MP) Jeremy Corbyn at the time of Chacko's formal appointment in May 2015. \\"I look forward to working with Ben in promoting socialism and progress\\". =Finances and circulation= The Morning Star carries little commercial advertising, with low advertising rates, and the cover price does not pay for print and distribution. Consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. The paper relies on its \\"Star Fund\\" appeal (monthly target ¬£16,000). In its past, the paper received a subsidy from the Soviet Union in the form of bulk orders. In 1981, its circulation was about 36,000, down from the Daily Workers post-war peak. In March 2005, BBC News Magazine reported the Morning Stars circulation as between 13,000 and 14,000, quoting Haylett's comment \\"perhaps only one in 10 of these readers would label themselves as Communists\\".See also The circulation was thought to be around 10,000 when Ben Chacko took over as editor in mid-2015. The Morning Star has also taken a much higher profile at trade union gatherings and within the UK trade union movement, particularly with unions such as Unite, GMB, UCATT, FBU, Community, CWU, NUM, Durham Miners, Prison Officers and RMT. Since 2008, the Morning Star has hired exhibition space at the Trades Union Congress, with sponsored copies being handed out to delegates at the TUC, Labour Party Conference, at union conferences and high profile events such as the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Festival and the Durham Miners Gala. The newspaper is also available at independent newsagents and shops such as Martin McColl, in local supermarkets such as Budgens, at railway stations and on motorway service areas. In addition, it is stocked by the Co-op Food chain of stores. During the early morning of 28 July 2008, the offices of the newspaper were damaged by fire,\\"Morning Star offices go up in smoke\\", Metro, 28 July 2008. and the edition of 29 July took a reduced form. A similar incident occurred on 20 October 2014 when a fire broke out near the offices and a small number of staff had to relocate to the sports editor's house in order to finish the paper. On 1 June 2009, the Morning Star was re-launched. The re-launch included a 16-page edition during the week, and a 24-page weekend edition priced at ¬£1.20 after a rise in its prices in September 2014.\\"Morning Star :: Changes to your weekend Morning Star\\". Retrieved on 5 December 2015. There is no Sunday edition of the newspaper. There was also an expanded use of colour pictures and graphics, plus a redesign and a modern layout of the pages. The Morning Star also redesigned its website. In addition, a number of new and experienced journalists were engaged and the positions of full-time Industrial Correspondent and Lobby Correspondent in the House of Commons were reintroduced. In November 2011, the Morning Star launched an urgent appeal to raise ¬£75,000 in order to address a number of funding issues which meant the paper might have gone under by the end of the year.Sunny Hundal \\"Morning Star could go under by Christmas\\", Liberal Conspiracy, 16 November 2011 On Monday 18 June 2012, the Morning Star moved to printing at two Trinity Mirror print sites in Watford and Oldham, which improved distribution of the Morning Star to all parts of the country, particularly Scotland. =Online version= An online version of the paper was launched on 1 April 2004.

The former free imperial city (until 1802) reached the limit of 100,000 residents in 1989. It is the ninth-largest city in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Reutlingen district's neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Esslingen, G√∂ppingen, Alb- Donau, Ostalbkreis, Biberach, Sigmaringen, Zollernalbkreis and T√ºbingen History The district dates back to the Oberamt Reutlingen, which was created in 1803 when the previously free imperial city Reutlingen became part of W√ºrttemberg. In 1934 it was converted into the district, in 1938 the district Urach was dissolved and split between the districts Reutlingen and M√ºnsingen. In 1973 the district M√ºnsingen was dissolved, and most part was merged into the district Reutlingen. A few municipalities from the districts T√ºbingen, Saulgau, Sigmaringen and N√ºrtingen were also added. Geography The district is largely located in the Swabian Alb (Schw√§bische Alb).

In 1870, he was elected as a deputy in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, where he promoted abolition of slavery. In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro was the founder of the Partido Autonomista (Autonomist Party), also known as \\"Partido Autonomista Puro\\" (Pure Autonomous Party), \\"Partido Hist√≥rico\\" (Historic Party), and \\"Partido Ortodoxo\\" (Orthodox Party).De los or√≠genes de los partidos pol√≠ticos en Puerto Rico al Partido Republicano Puertorrique√±o y don Jos√© Celso Barbosa II. Claridad. San Juan, Puerto Rico. Accessed 31 May 2019. Early years Baldorioty de Castro was born in Guaynabo to a poor family. His family moved to San Juan when he was young, where he received his primary education as a student of the noted educator, Rafael Cordero. After completing his elementary education, he enrolled in El Seminario Conciliar de Idelfonso, which at that time was the most organized institution in Puerto Rico. He spent most of his adolescent years studying, and finished with one of the best averages in his class. Baldorioty de Castro was granted a scholarship, which he used for further study in Spain. He collected the money necessary to travel and departed to Spain in the company of three fellow Puerto Ricans, two students and a professor. Before establishing a permanent residence in Madrid, the group traveled to several Spanish provinces, where they visited some of the country's tourist sites. Among the places visited were locations in Cordoba, Seville, And√∫jar and Bail√©n where they met Alberto Lista, an educator from Spain. The three other students (who traveled with Baldorioty de Castro) contracted smallpox shortly after beginning their academic studies in the Central University of Madrid. Baldorioty de Castro cared for them, but two of the youths died from complications of the disease. Baldorioty de Castro was offered a chance to return to Puerto Rico but he declined. He continued his studies along with the only survivor and graduated with a degree in physics and mathematical sciences from the university. Dr. Jos√© Gualberto Padilla together with Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro, founded the Puerto Rican chapter of the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s and called it \\"La Sociedad Econ√≥mica de Amigos del Pa√≠s en Puerto Rico\\" (the Economic Friends of Puerto Rico).Jos√© Gualberto Padilla, \\"El Caribe\\" POR NADIA S. RIVERA CASTILLO\\"XVIII Hombre del Pasado.\\"; Eugenio Astol; El Libro de Puerto Rico In 1847 the Sociedad de Amigos del Pa√≠s de Puerto Rico named Baldorioty de Castro the organization's correspondent in Spain. On 21 March 1851 he was granted permission to transfer to France to continue his studies. Baldorioty de Castro moved to Paris, where he attended the Central School of Arts. Political and professional careers Bust of Baldorioty de Castro In 1853, after seven years of study, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico and married Isabel Matilde D√≠az y Ruiz, the granddaughter of Lieutenant Francisco D√≠az, hero of the Battle of San Juan of 1797.Algunos de los participantes en las acciones ocurridas durante la invasi√≥n brit√°nica de 1797 Upon his return, he noticed that there was political tension, because of the differences between the governor in office and the political and educational groups in Puerto Rico. Baldorioty de Castro began promoting the restructuring of the social, political and educational establishments. These contributions led Fernando Norzagaray, the colony's incumbent governor to offer him the position of mayor of one of the island's municipalities (towns). Baldorioty de Castro declined the offer, based on his ideals. At the time, the government displayed no interest in promoting education among the Criollos of the island. Two years earlier, the governor had imposed the Reglamento del Jornalero, which promoted a more ample labor base by reducing the amount of unemployed citizens. However, this measure was criticized for its elements that were used to increase the wealth of employers. As a consequence, the merits of said law were reconsidered and a group led by Baldorioty de Castro was selected to decide its validity. In 1853, he became a member of the Liberal Reform Party of Puerto Rico. =Educator= Besides politics, Baldorioty de Castro also loved teaching. He taught Botany and Maritime Sciences at the School of Commerce, Agriculture and Maritime Studies in San Juan. In January 1854, the Councilor Seminary selected Baldorioty de Castro as its botany professor. On November of that year, Puerto Rico's Commerce and Foment Joint selected him to work as a professor in a Nautical School, where he taught Maritime Studies. The colonial government discovered that there was fertile terrain in the islands of Mona and Monito in 1856. After the discovery, they selected Baldorioty de Castro as the supervisor of a series of experiments to determine the terrain's components. Obelisk to Baldorioty de Castro in San Juan, Puerto Rico In 1857, the cattle industry in Puerto Rico began having difficulties, when the number of animals diminished significantly. To resolve this problem, the island's Economic Society formed a commission composed of Baldorioty de Castro, Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta and Juan Hern√°ndez Arbizu. Baldorioty de Castro proposed that geometry classes be included in the curriculum of elementary schools in Puerto Rico, which was accepted by the pertinent authority. On 2 January 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On 4 June 1860, the organization named him spokesman of a commission to promote conservation of the island's natural resources. Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On 17 September 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month. =Spanish parliament= While working in the Spanish Parliament, he made the most of his position and encouraged the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and drafting a constitution to guarantee Puerto Ricans more political rights.The World of 1898: The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Library of Congress On 4 November 1866, he was named Puerto Rico's representative to Paris' 1867 Universal Exposition. He served as a critic and subsequently wrote a review titled Exposici√≥n Universal de Par√≠s en 1967. Memoria presentada a la Comisi√≥n Provincial de Puerto Rico. After completing his participation in Paris, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico. There were rising tensions between groups that supported the abolition of slavery in the island and the Spanish colonial government. This led to protests and demands by the local Criollo population and influenced several revolutionaries, which led to the Grito de Lares. Baldorioty de Castro did not promote the armed revolution; instead he choose to debate the several conflicts and issues on diplomatic venues. After the revolution attempts, a new superior provisional government was established in the island. This government promoted a union between the conflicting parties in order to establish reforms in the government's structure. In line with the proposed solution, Baldorioty de Castro proposed a conciliation of these groups, but the efforts to unify the opposing views was unsuccessful. After this, he traveled to Madrid, under political pressure, and presented the island's status situation to the respective authorities. He began writing several documents that strongly criticized the colonial government and wrote a report listing the elements that he felt were being used by the administration that were affecting the island's social and economic aspects. In January 1867, Baldorioty de Castro received a communication from Puerto Rico's Superior Instruction Juncture, notifying him that he was selected as a member of the Test Commission, where he was in charge of monitoring tests being issued in physics and the natural sciences. In 1870, he was named deputy to the Spanish Parliament, after the governor in office had revoked his accreditation as an educator. There he continued to speak about his cause. Baldorioty de Castro became known as \\"The Father of Puerto Rican Autonomy\\". On 19 November 1872, Ramon Baldorioty de Castro together with Luis Padial, Julio Vizcarrondo and the Spanish Minister of Overseas Affairs, Segismundo Moret, presented a proposal for the abolition of slavery. On 22 March 1873, the Spanish Government approved the proposal, which became known as the Moret Law. Later years Pante√≥n Nacional Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro camposanto in Ponce, named in his honor and where Baldorioty de Castro's remains rest Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico in 1873 and went to live in the City of Ponce. There, he founded the newspaper El Derecho (The Law). He was also the founder of a weekly paper called La Cr√≥nica, in which he expressed his ideas on autonomy for the island. In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro co-founded, along with Jos√© de Diego, the Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico. He named a young and upcoming politician, Antonio R. Barcel√≥, the position of party Secretary. The Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico became one of Puerto Rico's first political parties. Its credo was that Puerto Rico should pick its own government and should have a representative in the Spanish Parliament. The Spanish government, however, considered Baldorioty de Castro a dangerous person and a dissenter and had him jailed in Fort San Felipe del Morro in San Juan. Although he was not in jail for long and was soon released, his health suffered greatly during this imprisonment. Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro died in Ponce on 30 September 1889. He is buried in Ponce's Cementerio Viejo cemetery which was renamed \\"Pante√≥n Nacional Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro\\". Legacy Statue of Baldorioty on PR-26.

In Puerto Rico's capital city, where the Baldorioty de Castro Expressway meets the Condado Lagoon in the Miramar neighborhood of Santurce, an obelisk was constructed in the center of the city park surrounding the lagoon. The obelisk is in honor of Baldorioty de Castro. A bronze statue of Baldority de Castro stands at the base of the statue as a gift of the people of Puerto Rico.

It has about 34,000 inhabitants. It is the historical and cultural centre of southwestern Moravia and the second most populated town in the South Moravian Region. The historic centre of Znojmo is well preserved and historically significant and is protected by law as urban monument reservation. Geography The town is situated on a rock outcropping on the steep left bank of the Thaya River, about southwest of the regional capital Brno. Located near the border with Austria, it is connected to Vienna by railway and road (about 80 minutes). History A fortress at the site possibly already existed during the time of the Great Moravian Empire in the 9th century. From about 1055, Znojmo Castle served as the residence of a P≈ôemyslid principality within the Bohemian March of Moravia and a strategic important outpost near the border with the Bavarian March of Austria in the south. Few years later (1101), Luitpold of Znojmo, Duke of Moravia, established the Ducal Rotunda of the Virgin Mary and St Catherine in this castle, later depicted by unique scene of genealogy Bohemian and Moravian Dukes of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty and the castle was conquered and devastated by Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia in 1145. In 1190, Duke Conrad II of Bohemia founded the Premonstratensian Louka Abbey at Znojmo, which became the settlement area of German-speaking immigrants in the course of the medieval Ostsiedlung movement. The royal city of Znojmo was founded shortly before 1226 by King Ottokar I of Bohemia on the plains in front of the reconstructed castle. The town privileges were confirmed by King Rudolf I of Germany in 1278. On 9 December 1437 the Luxembourg emperor Sigismund died at Znojmo and lay in state for three days at the St. Nicholas Church, before his mortal remains were transferred to Oradea in Hungary. From the 19th Century, Znojmo is best known as the site for the Armistice of Znaim concluded there on 12 July 1809 during the Battle of Znaim, after the decisive 7 days earlier Battle of Wagram, between Emperor Napoleon and the archduke Charles. From the 20th Century, it is also the (alleged) birthplace of Leopold Loyka, the driver of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand's car when Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo during 1914, an event which triggered the World War I. After the war, it was part of Czechoslovakia, except during the Nazi German occupation between 1938 and 1945 when it was part of Reichsgau Niederdonau. The German Citizens were expelled in 1945 according to the Bene≈° decrees. The birthplace of the sculptor Hugo Lederer and writer Charles Sealsfield, it also has a special co-operation relation with Harderwijk, Netherlands. Znojmo Town Hall Tower Sights The Gothic Church of St. Nicholas and the Late Gothic Town Hall tower are the most recognizable landmarks. St Nicolas Church was built in 1348 by Emperor Charles IV, and the town hall, with its 75 m (250 ft) tower, dates from around 1446. Overlooking the Thaya River valley, on the edge of the medieval city, there is Znojmo Castle, dating back to 11th century, founded by P≈ôemyslid dukes. The only remains of the castle used by the P≈ôemysl dukes is the Romanesque Rotunda of Saint Catherine, the interior of which is covered with 11th-century frescoes depicting biblical scenes and illustrating the life of P≈ôemysl. Under the town and castle is a vast labyrinth of connected passageways and cellars, Znojmo Catacombs, developed in the 14th and 15th century for defensive purposes and containing wells, drainage, fireplaces, trap doors and escapeways that led beyond the fortifications of the town. The catacombs are the largest system of underground corridors and cellars in the Czech Republic - they are almost 27 km long and up to 4 levels deep. Agriculture, viticulture and nature Znojmo is famous for local production of cucumbers, pickled in the original sweet-sour and spicy pickle, whose cultivation in the Znojmo region was introduced in 1571 by Louka monastery Abbot George II, coming from North Bohemian village ƒåepirohy. The special taste is also the result of local type of cucumbers, cultivation method, soil, climatic conditions, processing and also the packaging in which they are kept. These are also an ingredient of local specialties such as Znojmo roast or Znojmo goulash. Nowadays, the cucumber festivals are held in the town every year. Thanks to favorable climatic conditions, the town is successful also in winery and fruit growing. It is the center of viticulture of the Znojmo wine- growing sub-region and a destination for nature lovers, mainly thanks to the newly established National Park \\"Podyj√≠\\".

A Preliminary Study of Hoahaoism. Department of the Vietnamese Language, School of Foreign Studies, University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China. is a quasi-Buddhist religion, founded in 1939 by Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï (Popularly called Ph·∫≠t th·∫ßy, \\"Buddha Master\\" in Vietnamese), a native of the Mekong River Delta region of southern Vietnam. Adherents consider S·ªï to be a prophet, and H√≤a H·∫£o a continuation of a 19th-century Buddhist ministry known as B·ª≠u S∆°n K·ª≥ H∆∞∆°ng (Sino-Vietnamese ). The founders of these traditions are regarded by H√≤a H·∫£o followers as living Buddhas‚Äîdestined to save mankind from suffering and to protect the Vietnamese nation. H√≤a H·∫£o claims approximately ten million followers throughout Vietnam; in some provinces near its delta birthplace, as many as 90 percent of the population practice this tradition. An important characteristic of this movement is its emphasis on peasant farmers, exemplified by the old slogan, \\"Practicing Buddhism While Farming Your Land\\". H√≤a H·∫£o stresses the practice of Buddhism by lay people in the home, rather than focusing primarily on temple worship and ordination. Aid to the poor is favored over pagoda-building or expensive rituals; religious and social ceremonies are ideally simple and modest, and are not to include the food offerings, divination services, and elaborate wedding and funeral customs found in some manifestations of Southeast Asian life. These are viewed as a waste of money which would be better spent helping the needy. In H√≤a H·∫£o homes, a plain brown cloth serves as an altar, at which the family prays morning and night. Separate altars are used to honor ancestors and the sacred directions. Only fresh water, flowers, and incense are used in worship; no bells or gongs accompany prayers. A believer away from home at prayer times faces west (i.e., toward India) to pray to the Buddha. Adherents are expected to attend communal services on the 1st and 15th of each lunar month and on other Buddhist holy days. History Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï. Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï A pagoda of H√≤a H·∫£o Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï faced a great deal of trouble when he began to spread the ideas of his religion, a large part of which was Vietnamese nationalism, a dangerous idea in that time of French colonial rule. He was put in an asylum because of his preaching, but supposedly converted his doctor to the H√≤a H·∫£o belief. As the popularity of H√≤a H·∫£o grew, Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï made a series of prophecies about the political future of Vietnam. He said that the \\"true king\\" would return to lead Vietnam to freedom and prosperity, which caused most H√≤a H·∫£o to support the Nguy·ªÖn pretender: Marquis C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, living abroad in Japan. During World War II, the H√≤a H·∫£o supported the Japanese occupation and planned for C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ to become Emperor of Vietnam. However, this never happened and the H√≤a H·∫£o came into conflict with the communists both because the Vi·ªát Minh were anti-Japanese and because of their Marxist opposition to all religion. During the State of Vietnam (1949‚Äì1955), they made arrangements with the Head of State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, much like those made by the Cao ƒê√†i religion and the B√¨nh Xuy√™n gang, which were in control of their own affairs in return for their nominal support of the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i regime. In fact, the control of this government by France meant that most H√≤a H·∫£o opposed it. During the early years of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, An Giang Province and its capital Long Xuy√™n were among the few places in the Mekong Delta where Viet Cong activity was minimal and American and South Vietnamese troops could move without fear of sniper attack. After the war, the H√≤a H·∫£o were allowed to remain, but like all religions, under strict Communist control. Buu Son Ky Huong religion The ƒê·∫°o B·ª≠u S∆°n K·ª≥ H∆∞∆°ng religion was described by its adherents as \\"committed to the world\\". The basis of the Buu Son Ky Huong religion was the Buddha Master's claim to be a messenger from Heaven who had come into the world to warn mankind of the imminence of apocalypse. The key to this cult was simplicity, flexibility, and frugality. No one could plead lack of means or difficult circumstances as a justification for not carrying out his own religious duties and for relying instead on monks, but these duties were kept to a minimum. The Buddha Master's advocacy of ritual frugality probably attracted many poor peasants by allowing them to turn practical necessity into religious virtue. Because of the overwhelmingly domestic nature of the cult, the French observer Georges Coulet called it in 1926 the \\" Third Buddhist Order, \\" explaining that it was neither monastic nor congregational but mostly lay. However, he observed, there were days when adepts were expected to gather in pagodas that belonged to the sect: \\" This cult is sensibly a Buddhist cult. It consists of the observance of fasts and abstinences, of the daily recitation of prayers, of invocations which must be said at certain hours of the day or night: it imposes visits to mountain pagodas on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months of the Annamite year. Fasts and abstinences can be once a month, once every two months, once a week, once every two weeks, or perpetual . . . Offices are celebrated thrice a day: at dawn, noon, and dusk. At these times, candles are lit on the altar, and joss-sticks are placed in the incense-burner; the caretaker of the temple gives several strokes of the bell and the faithful perform several prostrations in front of the altar, bowing their heads to the ground. Prayers are said in low voice; a few beads are recited. Finally, in exchange for a contribution in money or goods, amulets are distributed by a monk of the pagoda; these amulets preserve from death, illness, and misfortune. Huynh Phu So =Background= The founder of the Hoa Hao was Huynh Phu So, who took for the name of his sect the village of Hoa Hao, in the Thot Not District of what is now An Giang Province. So's background is not completely known; but most authorities agree that he was a mystic who saw a vision instructing him to launch a new religion. He organised his sect in 1930, declared himself a prophet, and began to preach a doctrine based on simplicity and faith. Within a year, he had gathered a following of over 100,000 converts; and through his preaching, he established contact with another two million people in the Mien Tay region. =Beliefs= Huynh Phu So taught that each member of the sect could achieve direct communion with the Lord Buddha, and that internal faith was more important than external ceremony. Moreover, the care of the living has priority over the welfare of the dead. Huynh Phu So restated that the doctrine was lay-oriented, and he advocated the reduction of cultic expenses not only in the practice of Buddhism but also on all ceremonial occasions. He attacked the custom of overspending at the New Year, of bankrupting one's family at funerals and weddings, and of trying to outdo one's neighbors in conspicuous consumption. It was wrong to conceive of religious piety as something separate from the rest of life, as a set of exercises that were to be performed on an occasional basis. Huynh Phu So's stated objective was to \\"combine the ideal of universal love and charity with a new method of organizing society in order to serve better our people and mankind.‚Äù But he had no real understanding of the workings of a complex social system and therefore could not evolve a strategy for bringing about the new order of things, except through the violent expansion of his sect. Huynh Phu So embroidered the idea that money is the source of evil, both for those who had not enough and for those who had too much. While Huynh Phu So is regarded by most commentators as a traditionalist, and indeed many of his teachings support such an interpretation, he also had a well-defined modernizing vision, evident, for example in his imprecation against superstition. =Influence= No Vietnamese leader of the time possessed personal charisma to quite the same degree as Huynh Phu So. A measure of Huynh Phu So's powers of persuasion is that he made his mark as a healer despite his own well-publicised ill-health. Throughout his career, healing remained an important feature of his work; a substantial number of pamphlets describing the herbal remedies employed by Huynh Phu So still exist. So divided diseases into two categories: those that were the result of ordinary ill-fortune, and those that were the result of karmic retribution. The latter was not amenable to treatment; only repentance could alleviate it. Each of these new recruits were people of little education, interested in action rather than in doctrinal or political questions. They put themselves entirely at the service of Huynh Phu So. By August 1940, the Can Tho authorities were alarmed by their activities and by the destabilizing influence of Huynh Phu So. He was summoned for a psychiatric examination at Can Tho hospital. Huynh Phu So was taken to Cho Quan hospital in Cho Lon and put under the care of a Vietnamese doctor named Nguyen van Tam. The latter's verdict was more charitable: \\"This monk has never presented signs of agitation or insanity. He is mentally weak, with a disharmony of the intellectual faculties.\\" In spite of being considered \\"mentally weak,\\" So converted several of the hospital wardens and, more important, his own doctor. For a man who had never had any qualms about being called the Mad Monk, this was a resounding triumph which the sect exploited to the full. The doctor became a devoted follower of Huynh Phu So, until he was assassinated by the Viet Minh in 1948. In May 1945 Huynh Phu So issued a pamphlet called \\"Guidelines for the Practice of Religion\\" (Ton Chi Hanh Dao), in which he codified Hoa Hao cultic practices and for the first time imposed rules on admission into the sect. His adepts were exhorted to uphold the Three Bonds: between ruler and subject (transmuted into patriotism), father and son, and husband and wife. They were to observe the Five Virtues of benevolence, loyalty, propriety, intelligence, and integrity. Above all, they were to live in accord with one another. Whatever the usefulness of such a code of ethics in a modern, industrial society, it was quite effective within the confines of the average Hoa Hao village. Among themselves, the adepts relied on trust and did not bother to put doors on their houses to guard their belongings. =Death= Huynh Phu So was invited to a unity conference at a Viet Minh stronghold in the Plain of Reeds. On the way, he was led into a trap in which he and his four escorts were attacked but three were assassinated. The Viet Minh quartered his body and scattered it to prevent the Hoa Hao from recovering his remains and building a martyr's shrine. This rash and barbarous act resulted in a rupture incapable of subsequent reconciliation. The Hoa Hao vowed to wage eternal war against the Communists. Teachings =Impact= Hoa Hao religion combines the two kinds of Buddhism into one orientation: prescribing that all should strive to become monks for life but doing so at home and supporting themselves rather than turning into a caste of specialists permanently dependent on the community. The proscription on displaying Buddha statues on the household altar is borrowed from Islam‚Äôs proscription on the worship of images. The presence of a significant Islamic community in the local area has an impact on the Hoa Hao religion. A large community of ethnic Cham converts to Islam live in close proximity to Hoa Hao village. The surrounding area is full of mosques and its residents number many devout Muslims. Huynh Phu So, the founder of the Hoa Hao went to school in Tan Chau, in a heavily Muslim area. The influences are evident in the Hoa Hao‚Äôs religious practices; doctrine and architecture; the approach to prayer and preaching houses. A number of the towers, such as the one located by the Mekong River in Tan Chau town, have ornate sculpted decorations in an Islamic style and domed roofs. The Hoa Hao religion has been open to a range of different influences, including Marxism and US-style modernization ideology. For example, the combination of nationalist sentiments with the cult of heroes, the concept of a supreme being and US civic religion is found in this statement made by a contributor to a Hoa Hao Buddhist journal in the USA on the prospects for the democratization of Vietnam: I am praying to a higher power and to the sacred soul of the land, to the souls of heroes who have fallen on behalf of their beliefs and for the defense of the nation, so that they can prod and move and defeat this wave of atheism which is currently washing over Vietnam so that our people can welcome the light of Freedom and Democracy. =Development= Return of the French colonial regime was a major disappointment to the Hoa Hao, as it was to Vietnamese nationalists of all political persuasions. Huynh Phu So had hoped that his sect would become the de facto ruling power throughout most of Cochinchina. But the return of the French in strength too numerous for the Hoa Hao \\"army\\" to oppose effectively put a temporary end to such hopes. The Hoa Hao turned their attention inward, both to solidify their sectarian strength and to increase their political influence in the delta. The French, becoming increasingly distrustful of the Viet Minh, soon gave the Hoa Hao territorial hegemony in the southwestern delta. Huynh Phu So for his part was willing to engage in alliances with the colonialists in return for support against the Viet Minh. Eventually the French provided arms for some 20,000 Hoa Hao troops. Such an accommodation was not considered by the Hoa Hao as a betrayal of their nationalist goals, because the ultimate aim of sectarian independence was not compromised. The Hoa Hao had long been suspicious of the National Front and the Viet Minh, and had actively fought the latter for years. The shift in loyalty from the colonialists to the National Front movement did not represent a major break for the Hoa Hao. As in their prior maneuverings, their action was primarily a move to solidify their own control of the western delta. Strengthened by French armaments, the Hoa Hao now turned against the French because they were convinced that colonial rule in Vietnam was destined to be ended by Asians. The Hoa Hao were certain that the French could and would be forced out of Indochina in the not-too-distinct future. But the Hoa Hao \\"alliance\\" with the Viet Minh was short-lived. It soon became clear that religious autonomy and the attendant political freedom demanded by the Hoa Hao were incompatible with Viet Minh plans. Before long, Huynh Phu So was preaching with growing frenzy against the Viet Minh, which he now perceived as an even greater threat to the sect than the French. The struggle with the Viet Minh became a fanatical religious war. So preached that any Hoa Hao killing ten Viet Minh would have a straight pathway to heaven. Although the Hoa Hao had an \\"army\\" of four combat battalions, they were eventually defeated by Saigon's much larger forces. The final Saigon victories in 1962 signaled the end of the independent Hao Hao army. But despite military defeat at the hands of Saigon, the Hoa Hao continued to maintain their religious and political hold over the territory west of the Bassac River and the delta capital city of Can Tho. They also held onto their arms, and organized militia forces to defend the geographical heartland of the movement. The Hoa Hao were too strong a force to allow the Saigon government the luxury of continued political or religious warfare. As a result, the Hoa Hao were thereafter left alone, and won tacit permission to maintain a kind of sovereignty in the Transbassac. In return, the Hoa Hao recognized the authority of the Saigon regime. No longer forced to devote their military forces to the struggle against the central government, they were able to resume their feud with the Communists. The Hoa Hao took full advantage of this new-found independence to wage total war against the Communists, now known as the Viet Cong. While political influence was welcome, the Hoa Hao had also achieved their primary goal-religious independence. Being a Hoa Hao was no longer a bar to participation in government, and the sect was no longer subject to religious discrimination by the orthodox Buddhist hierarchy. But it was the military strength of the Hoa Hao that gave the sect its strongest lever of influence, and its ability to provide a high degree of local security in the provinces it controlled. Huynh Phu So insisted on being referred to by his proper name of So and on using for his sect the name of his native village of Hoa Hao which meant \\"peace and plenty.\\" He would no longer be one of many healers and preachers but the prophet of a distinct religious movement with its own name, built on the Buu Son Ky Huong tradition rather than simply part of it. The sect expanded rapidly under Japanese protection. Even though Huynh Phu So was unable to leave Saigon, his apostles recruited on his behalf, using the familiar mixture of doom-laden predictions and veiled threats against those who did not join and distributing cures and amulets. By 1943, the Hoa Hao sect was thus moving in the direction of greater institutionalization. The death of Huynh Phu So thus marked the end of the Hoa Hao millenarianism and the beginning of purely communal politics. Within the Hoa Hao communities, the preachers of old were replaced by lay administrators who were elected and unpaid. Healing was now the province of a health service operated free of charge by the sect. Evangelizing took the form of religious and academic education. The sect opened schools at all levels, and in the early 1970s it even established a university. Western technology in fact provided the sect with a new tool of mass education when the focus of Hoa Hao village life, the reading-room, was connected to a public-address system. The sayings of Patriarch Huynh were thus broadcast daily over loudspeakers. Charity also became organized: the sect offered relief for veterans and prisoners, for victims of floods and fire, for old people and orphans. Life in Hoa Hao villages continued to be led along simple lines. The adepts were guided by Huynh Phu So's teachings concerning cultic practices and daily conduct, and they kept the number of ceremonies low and the expenses connected with them minimal. Neither adepts nor leaders were particularly interested any longer in promoting radical change or even in pursuing the violent expansion of the sect. Their energies were now devoted to the preservation of the communitarian style of life which was the other Buu Son Ky Huong ideal. But communitarianism proved ill-suited to the social complexities of an urban environment. Furthermore, the adepts are virtually leaderless. The establishment of the sectarian infrastructure helped preserve their cohesion, but the corollary de-emphasis on charisma made it harder to mobilize the collectivity of the adepts into action. =General features= The Hoa Hao works images of globes into their iconography which is an aesthetic expression of universalism reflecting an imagining of the spatial condition as global. This symbol has a mnemonic function as one of the four injunctions of the Hoa Hao faith is to recognize one‚Äôs debt to humanity. Yet it is also a reminder to followers that the propagation of the Hoa Hao faith is considered a sacred mission in order to reform mankind. This value is also reinforced in the prescribed color for the altar cloth and flag, which is brown. As brown is considered the combination of all colors, it is used to symbolize human harmony and the connectedness and interdependence of all people. Hoa Hao Buddhism is generally considered an apocalyptic religion: believers are held to anticipate the impending destruction of the world and seek refuge provided by faith. This illuminates the history of violence in which the Hoa Hao have been involved. Goal The ultimate goal of the Hoa Hao religion is the preservation of their religious identity and independence. Temporary alliances with past enemies were formed only as a means of survival and to gain strength for the future. Originally concerned only with religious autonomy, the Hoa Hao became a nationalist anti-French movement before World War II; then increasingly anti-Communist as it struggled for supremacy with the Viet Minh; then overtly pro-Japanese for purely tactical reasons. With the end of the war, the Hoa Hao joined with their old enemy, the French colonialists, to strengthen themselves against a more serious foe, the Viet Minh. But the ultimate goal of the movement was always to control its own destiny without interference from any outside source. =Followers= The earliest followers of the Hoa Hao were not just landless peasants impoverished by capitalism but small holders and there are those who work in transport, light industry and trade. The leaders of the Hoa Hao faith were recruited from schoolteachers, itinerant drivers and motor coach and river launch conductors, people on the nodes of the most important communicative pathways of colonial society. Today, some of the most cosmopolitan people in the delta, boat captains, traders, caf√© owners and physicians, belong to this religion. Taylor has found members of the faith, like many residents of the Mekong Delta, to have wide horizons. They are informed about and engaged with current developments, interested in news of the outside world, focused on social work, improving the physical infrastructure of their locale and the building of a moral community. =Followers' contributions= Of a less revolutionary order of activity, members of the faith are also very active in health care provision, community development activities and philanthropy. Such activities in accordance with the Master‚Äôs injunction to social engagement represent a viable and promising basis for the Hoa Hao to secure broader political support. =Followers' thoughts about the future of the religion= The H√≤a H·∫£o followers with whom Taylor spoke consider their home at the epicentre of world Buddhism, the Buddha having re-incarnated as Huynh Phu So. Many believe that Hoa Hao Buddhism spread from Vietnam to the rest of the world, following his overseas travels. In each land he visited the creed has been adapted to the local customs and is called by a different name. Today many members of the Hoa Hao still consider themselves engaged in a desperate struggle for survival, Some followers with whom Taylor spoke in Vietnam believed that the religion has recently secured limited recognition because of the large number of Hoa Hao believers who are in the local party and state administration quietly pushing for change. Reported persecution Although H√≤a H·∫£o Buddhism is an officially recognized religion in Vietnam, many members refuse the forceful governmental affiliation which is entailed by official recognition and an unknown number of religious leaders have been detained for this reason. Two H√≤a H·∫£o Buddhists self-immolated in 2005 to protest against religious persecution and more recently, after a wave of arrests of H√≤a H·∫£o Buddhists, nine more were imprisoned in May 2007. H√≤a H·∫£oists reportedly do not believe their founder died under torture. They surmise that he is still among the living. In 2007, the Vietnamese government had the printed prophesies of the founder seized and reprinted to a volume slightly more than half the original size. The ceremonies commemorating the birth of this prophet were outlawed. Since then, H√≤a H·∫£o split into two factions ‚Äì more and less militant. Some H√≤a H·∫£o adherents migrated to the United States. The largest number of H√≤a H·∫£o- ists live in Santa Ana, California, USA. Hoa Hao claim to have faced restrictions on their religious and political activities after 1975, in part because of their previous armed opposition to Communist forces. A tentative easing of control on the religion began in 1999. There were, however, crackdowns in the face of demands that the government speed up this process. In 2001 there were again serious protests and arrests; a female member of the religion reportedly committed self-immolation to protest against restrictions on religious freedom  Teachings  Hoa Hao Buddhism draws upon an earlier Buddhist millenarian movement called B·ª≠u S∆°n K·ª≥ H∆∞∆°ng and reveres ƒêo√†n Minh Huy√™n (14 November 1807 - 10 September 1856) who started the movement as a living, healing Buddha. He is referred to as Ph·∫≠t Th·∫ßy T√¢y An or \\"Buddha Master of the Western Peace\\". However, the founder of Hoa Hao Buddhism, Huynh Phu So, also organized Hoa Hao teachings into a more structured movement focused on self-cultivation, filial piety and reverence toward the Three Treasures of Buddhism (the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha). As a lay- Buddhist organization primarily focused on Vietnamese peasants, it also eschews elaborate Buddhist rituals, maintains no monastic order, and teaches home practice.

He was best known for his national radio and television shows between 1937 and 1971, especially as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, and then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" pantomime sketch, which he wrote together with his wife, launched a career for him in vaudeville, radio, and films. His radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour, which led to his becoming the host of Avalon Time in 1938. He became the host of The Raleigh Cigarette Program in 1941, on which many of his comedy characters were created, and he had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Alfred Santell's Having Wonderful Time, and would appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and 1950s, with starring roles in 19 films, including Ship Ahoy (1941), I Dood It (1943), Ziegfeld Follies (1946), and The Clown (1953). Skelton was eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. The Red Skelton Show made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed The Red Skelton Hour in 1962. Despite high ratings, the show was canceled by CBS in 1970, as the network believed that more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. He spent his time after that making as many as 125 personal appearances a year and working on his paintings. Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964, when his wife Georgia persuaded him to show it at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer said he thought that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television performances. Skelton believed that his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year-long career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes. Biography =Early years, the medicine show and the circus (1913‚Äì1929)= According to some sources, Skelton was born Richard Red Skelton on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana. In a 1983 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Skelton claimed his middle name was really \\"Red\\" and that he had made up the middle name Bernard, from the name of a local store, Bernard Clothiers, to satisfy a schoolteacher who would not believe his middle name was \\"Red\\". He repeated the story on The Dini Petty Show in 1992. Skelton was the fourth and youngest son of Joseph Elmer and Ida Mae (Fields) Skelton (who later took her second husband's surname, Eheart). Joseph Skelton, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; he had once been a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. His birth certificate surname was that of his father's stepfather. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future. Because of the loss of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling newspapers and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned out to be one of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer. Skelton discovered at an early age that he could make people laugh. Skelton dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in minstrel shows in Vincennes, and on a showboat, The Cotton Blossom, that plied the Ohio and Missouri rivers. He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end. Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence stock theater company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead. In another incident, while performing in Uncle Tom's Cabin, Skelton was on an unseen treadmill; when it malfunctioned and began working in reverse, the frightened young actor called out, \\"Help! I'm backing into heaven!\\" He was fired before completing a week's work in the role. At the age of 15, Skelton did some early work on the burlesque circuit, and reportedly spent four months with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus in 1929, when he was 16 years old. Ida Skelton, who held multiple jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but \\"his destiny had caught up with him at an early age\\". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined \\"Doc\\" R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: \\"We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon.\\" =Burlesque to vaudeville (1929‚Äì1937)= Red and Edna Skelton at home, 1942 As burlesque comedy material became progressively more ribald, Skelton moved on. He insisted that he was no prude; \\"I just didn't think the lines were funny\\". He became a sought-after master of ceremonies for dance marathons (known as \\"walkathons\\" at the time), a popular fad in the 1930s. The winner of one of the marathons was Edna Stillwell, an usher at the old Pantages Theater. She approached Skelton after winning the contest and told him that she did not like his jokes; he asked if she could do better. They married in 1931 in Kansas City, and Edna began writing his material. At the time of their marriage Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday; Edna was 16. When they learned that Skelton's salary was to be cut, Edna went to see the boss; he resented the interference, until she came away with not only a raise, but additional considerations as well. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought textbooks and taught him what he had missed. With Edna's help, Skelton received a high school equivalency degree. The couple put together an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, but by the time they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked. He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port. \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" Skelton with John Garfield at the 1944 FDR Birthday Ball Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada. Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's Loew's State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee. The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, \\"Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once.\\" His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward. =Film work= Skelton with Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey as radio detective \\"The Fox\\" in Whistling in the Dark (1941) Skelton's first contact with Hollywood came in the form of a failed 1932 screen test. In 1938 he made his film debut for RKO Pictures in the supporting role of a camp counselor in Having Wonderful Time. He appeared in two short subjects for Vitaphone in 1939: Seeing Red and The Broadway Buckaroo. Actor Mickey Rooney contacted Skelton, urging him to try for work in films after seeing him perform his \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" act at President Roosevelt's 1940 birthday party. For his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer screen test, Skelton performed many of his more popular skits, such as \\"Guzzler's Gin\\", but added some impromptu pantomimes as the cameras were rolling. \\"Imitation of Movie Heroes Dying\\" were Skelton's impressions of the cinema deaths of stars like George Raft, Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. Skelton appeared in numerous films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer throughout the 1940s. In 1940 he provided comic relief as a lieutenant in Frank Borzage's war drama Flight Command, opposite Robert Taylor, Ruth Hussey and Walter Pidgeon. In 1941 he also provided comic relief in Harold S. Bucquet's Dr. Kildare medical dramas, Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day and The People vs. Dr. Kildare. Skelton was soon starring in comedy features as inept radio detective \\"The Fox\\", the first of which was Whistling in the Dark (1941) in which he began working with director S. Sylvan Simon, who would become his favorite director. He reprised the same role opposite Ann Rutherford in Simon's other pictures, including Whistling in Dixie (1942) and Whistling in Brooklyn (1943). In 1941, Skelton began appearing in musical comedies, starring opposite Eleanor Powell, Ann Sothern and Robert Young in Norman Z. McLeod's Lady Be Good. In 1942 Skelton again starred opposite Eleanor Powell in Edward Buzzell's Ship Ahoy, and alongside Ann Sothern in McLeod's Panama Hattie. Skelton (center left) in Panama Hattie (1942) In 1943, after a memorable role as a nightclub hatcheck attendant who becomes King Louis XV of France in a dream opposite Lucille Ball and Gene Kelly in Roy Del Ruth's Du Barry Was a Lady, Skelton starred as Joseph Rivington Reynolds, a hotel valet besotted with Broadway starlet Constance Shaw (Powell) in Vincente Minnelli's romantic musical comedy, I Dood It. The film was largely a remake of Buster Keaton's Spite Marriage; Keaton, who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished, began coaching Skelton on set during the filming. Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton's films, and his 1926 film The General was also later rewritten to become Skelton's A Southern Yankee (1948), under directors S. Sylvan Simon and Edward Sedgwick. Keaton was convinced enough of Skelton's comedic talent that he approached MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer with a request to create a small company within MGM for himself and Skelton, where the two could work on film projects. Keaton offered to forgo his salary if the films made by the company were not box office hits; Mayer chose to decline the request. In 1944, Skelton starred opposite Esther Williams in George Sidney's musical comedy Bathing Beauty, playing a songwriter with romantic difficulties. He next had a relatively minor role as a \\"TV announcer who, in the course of demonstrating a brand of gin, progresses from mild inebriation through messy drunkenness to full-blown stupor\\" in the \\"When Television Comes\\" segment of Ziegfeld Follies, which featured William Powell and Judy Garland in the main roles. In 1946, Skelton played boastful clerk J. Aubrey Piper opposite Marilyn Maxwell and Marjorie Main in Harry Beaumont's comedy picture The Show-Off.

Theater owner Sid Grauman is in foreground of photo. Skelton's contract called for MGM's approval prior to his radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio and to be able to work on television, which was then largely experimental. At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio's written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of The Fuller Brush Man, saying, \\"Movies are not my field. Radio and television are.\\" He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the U.S. with his radio show. Skelton's ability to successfully ad-lib often meant that the way the script was written was not always the way it was recorded on film. Some directors were delighted with the creativity, but others were often frustrated by it. S. Sylvan Simon, who became a close friend, allowed Skelton free rein when directing him. MGM became annoyed with Simon during the filming of The Fuller Brush Man, as the studio contended that Skelton should have been playing romantic leads instead of performing slapstick. Simon and MGM parted company when he was not asked to direct retakes of Skelton's A Southern Yankee; Simon asked that his name be removed from the film's credits. Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television. This time the studio was willing to grant it, making Skelton the only major MGM personality with the privilege. The 1950 negotiations allowed him to begin working in television beginning September 30, 1951. During the last portion of his contract with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on television in addition to films. He would go on to appear in films such as Jack Donohue's The Yellow Cab Man (1950), Roy Rowland and Buster Keaton's Excuse My Dust (1951), Charles Walters' Texas Carnival (1951), Mervyn LeRoy's Lovely to Look At (1952), Robert Z. Leonard's The Clown (1953) and The Great Diamond Robbery (1954), and Norman Z. McLeod's poorly received Public Pigeon No. 1 (1957), his last major film role, which originated incidentally from an episode of the television anthology series Climax!. In a 1956 interview, he said he would never work simultaneously in all three media again. As a result, Skelton would make only a couple of minor appearances in films after this, including playing a saloon drunk in Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), a fictional version of himself as a gambler in Ocean's 11 (1960), and a Neanderthal man in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965). =Radio, divorce and remarriage (1937‚Äì1951)= Performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" routine led to Skelton's first appearance on Rudy Vall√©e's The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour on August 12, 1937. Vall√©e's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. Vall√©e also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native Joe Cook to appear as a guest with Skelton. The two Hoosiers proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an Evansville native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes. The show received enough fan mail after the performance to invite both comedians back two weeks after Skelton's initial appearance and again in November of that year. On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced Red Foley as the host of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients. Skelton went on the air with his own radio show, The Raleigh Cigarette Program, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits. \\"I dood it!\\" Skelton with \\"Doolittle Dood It\\" newspaper headline, 1942 (large file) (PDF) Skelton introduced the first two of his many characters during The Raleigh Cigarette Program's first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper was based on a Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was similar to the later cartoon character, Bullwinkle; there was enough similarity to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose. The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or \\"Junior\\", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. \\"Junior\\" would say things like, \\"If I dood it, I gets a whipping.\\", followed moments later by the statement, \\"I dood it!\\" Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname \\"Junior\\" long before it was heard by a radio audience. While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna's. Skelton starred in a 1943 movie of the same name, but did not play \\"Junior\\" in the film. The phrase was such a part of national culture at the time that, when General Doolittle conducted the bombing of Tokyo in 1942, many newspapers used the phrase \\"Doolittle Dood It\\" as a headline. After a talk with President Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a Douglas A-20 Havoc to be given to the Soviet Army to help fight World War II. Asking children to send in their spare change, he raised enough money for the aircraft in two weeks; he named the bomber \\"We Dood It!\\"The original spelling was \\"We Doo'd it\\" . In 1986 the Soviet newspaper Pravda offered praise to Skelton for his 1943 gift, and in 1993, the pilot of the plane was able to meet Skelton and thank him for the bomber. Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called \\"Mellow Cigars\\", the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; he renamed the routine \\"Guzzler's Gin\\", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor's wares. While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience warm-up in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite. After the regular radio program had ended, the show's audience were treated to a post-program performance. He would then perform his \\"Guzzler's Gin\\" or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show. He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program. As a result, studio audience tickets for Skelton's radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people had to be turned away for lack of seats. Divorce from Edna, marriage to Georgia In 1942, Edna announced that she was leaving Skelton but would continue to manage his career and write material for him. He did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC. They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm. The couple did not discuss the reasons for their divorce and Edna initially prepared to work as a script writer for other radio programs. When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity. Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets. She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts. The Skeltons, circa 1957. Back from left: Red, wife Georgia, sister in law Maxine Davis. Front: Son Richard and daughter Valentina The divorce meant that Skelton had lost his married man's deferment; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, the day before he was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband. He was on army furlough for throat discomfort when he married actress Georgia Maureen Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on March 9, 1945; the couple met on the MGM lot. \\"Red Skelton will be Private Richard Skelton on May 25.\\" (pay per view) Skelton traveled to Los Angeles from the eastern army base where he was assigned for the wedding. He knew he would possibly be assigned overseas soon and wanted the marriage to take place first. After the wedding, he entered the hospital to have his tonsils removed. The couple had two children; Valentina, a daughter, was born May 5, 1947, and a son, Richard, was born May 20, 1948.

Seated: Verna Felton (\\"Grandma\\" to Skelton's \\"Junior\\" character), Rod O'Connor (announcer), Lurene Tuttle (\\"Mother\\" to Skelton's \\"Junior\\" character). Front: Skelton Skelton served in the United States Army during World War II. After being assigned to the Special Services, Skelton performed as many as ten to twelve shows per day before troops in both the United States and in Europe. The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer exhaustion and a nervous breakdown. He had a nervous collapse while in the army, following which he developed a stutter. While recovering at an army hospital at Camp Pickett, Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive. Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh. As a result of this effort, his stutter reduced; his army friend's condition also improved and he was no longer on the critical list. He was released from his army duties in September 1945. \\"I've been told I'm the only celebrity who entered the Army as a private and came out a private,\\" he told reporters.Associated Press, \\"Comedian Out of Army With Rank Unchanged\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 30 September 1945, Volume 52, page 6. His sponsor was eager to have him back on the air, and Skelton's program began anew on NBC on December 4, 1945. Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a \\"loudmouthed braggart\\"; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; Deadeye, a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations. By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was David Rose, who would go on to television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air. On April 22, 1947, Skelton was censored by NBC two minutes into his radio show. When he and his announcer Rod O'Connor began talking about Fred Allen being censored the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds; comedian Bob Hope was given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen. Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience's benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. He had been briefly censored the previous month for the use of the word \\"diaper\\". After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer pull the plug for similar reasons. Skelton changed sponsors in 1948; Brown & Williamson, owners of Raleigh cigarettes, withdrew due to program production costs. His new sponsor was Procter & Gamble's Tide laundry detergent. The next year he changed networks, going from NBC to CBS, where his radio show aired until May 1953. After his network radio contract was over, he signed a three-year contract with Ziv Radio for a syndicated radio program in 1954. His syndicated radio program was offered as a daily show; it included segments of his older network radio programs as well as new material done for the syndication. He was able to use portions of his older radio shows because he owned the rights for rebroadcasting them. =Television (1951‚Äì1970)= Skelton was unable to work in television until the end of his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. On May 4, 1951, he signed a contract for television with NBC; Procter and Gamble was his sponsor. He said he would be performing the same characters on television that he had been doing on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. His television debut, The Red Skelton Show, premiered on that date: At the end of his opening monologue, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called \\"Holiday for Strings\\", became Skelton's TV theme song. The move to television allowed him to create two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by, tucking his thumbs under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird's bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His \\"Freddie the Freeloader\\" clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father's makeup for the character. ( He learned how to duplicate his father's makeup and perform his routines through his mother's recollections.) A ritual was established for the end of every program, with Skelton's shy boyish wave and words of, \\"Good night and may God bless.\\" Skelton as Willie Lump-Lump and Shirley Mitchell as his wife, who appears to be walking on the wall in a 1952 Skelton show sketch. During the 1951‚Äì1952 season, the program was broadcast from a converted NBC radio studio. The first year of the television show was done live; this led to problems, because there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not knowing which way is up. The script was completed, and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he is misled into believing he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing. Skelton was delivering an intense performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness. In 1952, he was drinking heavily due to the constant physical pain of a diaphragmatic hernia and the emotional distress of marital problems. He thought about divorcing Georgia. NBC agreed to film his shows in the 1952‚Äì1953 season at Eagle Lion Studios, next to the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. Later the show was moved to the new NBC television studios in Burbank. Procter & Gamble was unhappy with the filming of the television show, and insisted that Skelton return to live broadcasts. The situation made him think about leaving television. Declining ratings prompted sponsor Procter & Gamble to cancel his show in the spring of 1953. Skelton announced that any of his future television programs would be variety shows, where he would not have the almost constant burden of performing. Beginning with the 1953‚Äì1954 season, he switched to CBS, where he remained until 1970. For the initial move to CBS, he had no sponsor. The network gambled by covering all expenses for the program on a sustaining basis: His first CBS sponsor was Geritol. He curtailed his drinking and his ratings at CBS began to improve, especially after he began appearing on Tuesday nights for co-sponsors Johnson's Wax and Pet Milk Company. By 1955, Skelton was broadcasting some of his weekly programs in color, which was the case approximately 100 times between 1955 and 1960. He tried to encourage CBS to do other shows in color at the facility, but CBS mostly avoided color broadcasting after the network's television-set manufacturing division was discontinued in 1951. By 1959, Skelton was the only comedian with a weekly variety television show. Others who remained on the air, such as Danny Thomas, were performing their routines as part of situation comedy programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits required editing for the Tuesday program. For the Tuesday afternoon run-through prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will. The run-through was well attended by CBS Television City employees. Sometimes during live telecasts and taped programs, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh. Richard's illness and death Skelton and Mickey Rooney at dress rehearsal for The Red Skelton Show of January 15, 1957. Skelton as a sailor and Rooney as his wife play contestants on a parody of Do You Trust Your Wife?. This was Skelton's return to television after his son Richard's leukemia diagnosis. At the height of Skelton's popularity, his nine-year-old son Richard was diagnosed with leukemia and was given a year to live. While the network told him to take as much time off as necessary, Skelton felt that unless he went back to his television show he would be unable to be at ease and make his son's life a happy one. He returned to his television show on January 15, 1957, with guest star Mickey Rooney helping to lift his spirits. In happier times, he had frequently mentioned his children on his program, but he found it extremely difficult to do this after Richard became ill. Skelton resumed this practice only after his son asked him to do so.(PDF) After his son's diagnosis, Skelton took his family on an extended trip, so Richard could see as much of the world as possible. The Skeltons had an audience with Pope Pius XII on July 22, 1957. According to an International News Service article that appeared in the Aug. 1, 1957, issue of the St.Joseph, Missouri News Press, Richard said that the audience with the Pope was the high point of the trip so far. The Skeltons cut their travels short and returned to the United States after an encounter with an aggressive reporter in London and relentlessly negative reports in British newspapers. The Skelton family received support from CBS management and from the public following the announcement of Richard's illness. in November, Skelton fell downstairs and injured an ankle, and he nearly died after a ‚Äúcardiac-asthma‚Äù attack on December 30, 1957. He was taken to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where, his doctors said, ‚Äúif there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them by the time he had arrived\\". Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television and the next thing he remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958. Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was ten days before the child's tenth birthday. (pay-per view) Skelton was scheduled to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. His friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red Skelton Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. Richard ‚Äòs death had a profound effect on the family. Life magazine, profiling ‚ÄúThe Invincible Red‚Äù on April 21, 1961, observed that Skelton was still ‚Äúracked‚Äù by his son‚Äôs death. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the two days a week when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping. The Red Skelton Hour In early 1960, Skelton purchased the old Charlie Chaplin Studios and updated it for videotape recording. With a recently purchased three-truck mobile color television unit, he recorded a number of his series episodes and specials in color. Even with his color facilities, CBS discontinued color broadcasts on a regular basis and Skelton shortly thereafter sold the studio to CBS and the mobile unit to local station KTLA. Prior to this, he had been filming at Desilu Productions. Skelton then moved back to the network's Television City facilities, where he taped his programs until he left the network. In the fall of 1962, CBS expanded his program to a full hour, retitling it The Red Skelton Hour. Although it was a staple of his radio programs, he did not perform his \\"Junior\\" character on television until 1962, after extending the length of his program. Skelton as Freddie the Freeloader (right) and Terry-Thomas Skelton frequently employed the art of pantomime for his characters: a segment of his weekly program was called the \\"Silent Spot.‚Äù He attributed his liking for pantomime and for using few props to the early days when he did not want to have a lot of luggage. He explained that having the right hat was the key to getting into character. Skelton's season premiere for the 1960‚Äì1961 television season was a tribute to the United Nations. Six hundred people from the organization, including diplomats, were invited to be part of the audience for the show. The program was entirely done in pantomime, as UN representatives from 39 nations were in the studio audience. One of the sketches he performed for the UN was that of the old man watching the parade. The sketch had its origins in a question Skelton's son, Richard, asked his father about what happens when people die. He told his son, \\"They join a parade and start marching.\\" In 1965, Skelton did another show completely in pantomime. This time he was joined by Marcel Marceau; the two artists alternated performances for the hour-long program, sharing the stage to perform Pinocchio. The only person who spoke during the hour was Maurice Chevalier, who served as the show's narrator. In 1969, Skelton wrote and performed a monologue about the Pledge of Allegiance. In the speech, he commented on the meaning of each phrase of the pledge. He credited one of his Vincennes grammar school teachers, Mr. Laswell, with the original speech. The teacher had grown tired of hearing his students monotonously recite the pledge each morning; he then demonstrated to them how it should be recited, along with comments about the meaning behind each phrase. CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monologue as a single on Columbia Records. A year later, he performed the monologue for President Richard Nixon at the first \\"Evening at the White House\\", a series of entertainment events honoring the recently inaugurated president. =Off the air and bitterness (1970‚Äì1983)= As the 1970s began, the networks began a major campaign to discontinue long-running shows that they considered stale or lacking youth appeal. Despite Skelton's continued strong ratings, CBS saw his show as fitting into this category and canceled the program along with other comedy and variety shows hosted by veterans such as Jackie Gleason and Ed Sullivan. Performing in Las Vegas when he got the news of his CBS cancellation, Skelton said, \\"My heart has been broken.\\" His program had been one of the top ten highest rated shows for 17 of the 20 years he was on television. Skelton moved to NBC in 1970 in a half-hour Monday night version of his former show. Its cancellation after one season ended his television career, and he returned to live performances. In an effort to prove the networks wrong, he gave many of these at colleges and proved popular with the audience. Skelton was bitter about CBS's cancellation for many years afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction at the height of the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, one of the Senate‚Äôs strongest supporters of the war, to appear on his program. There were personal as well as professional changes in Skelton's life at this time. He divorced Georgia in 1971 and married Lothian Toland, daughter of cinematographer Gregg Toland, on October 7, 1973. While he disassociated himself from television soon after his show was canceled, his bitterness had subsided enough for him to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on July 11, 1975; it was his first television appearance since the cancellation of his last television program. (Johnny Carson, one of his former writers, began his rise to network television prominence when he substituted for Skelton after a dress rehearsal injury in 1954.) Skelton was also a guest on The Merv Griffin Show in October of the same year. Any hopes he may have had that he might ease back into television through the talk/show circuit were destroyed on May 10, 1976, when Georgia Skelton committed suicide by gunshot on the 18th anniversary of Richard Skelton's death. Georgia was 54 and had been in poor health for some time. He put all professional activities on hold for some months as he mourned his former wife's death. Skelton made plans in 1977 to sell the rights to his old television programs as part of a package which would bring him back to regular television appearances. The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this did not materialize. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a report that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. Skelton contended his remarks were made at a time when he was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context. He said at the time, \\"Would you burn the only monument you've built in over 20 years?\\" As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, Group W announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton's death. =Skelton onstage= Skelton's 70-year career as an entertainer began as a stage performer. He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as \\"palaces\\"; he also likened them to his \\"living room\\", where he would privately entertain guests. At the end of a performance, he would look at the empty stage where there was now no laughter or applause and tell himself, \\"Tomorrow I must start again. One hour ago, I was a big man. I was important out there. Now it's empty. It's all gone.\\" Skelton was invited to play a four-week date at the London Palladium in July 1951. While flying to the engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, were on a plane from Rome with passengers from an assortment of countries that included 11 children. The plane lost the use of two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest, meaning that the plane would crash over Mont Blanc. The priest readied himself to administer last rites. As he did so, he told Skelton, \\"You take care of your department, Red, and I'll take care of mine.\\" Skelton diverted the attention of the passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed. They ultimately landed at a small airstrip in Lyon, France. (PDF) He received both an enthusiastic reception and an invitation to return for the Palladium's Christmas show of that year. Though Skelton had always done live engagements at Nevada hotels and appearances such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after he was no longer on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls. Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites. The venue's ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. Skelton's performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a sign language interpreter to translate the non- pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday. =Later years and death= Skelton in 1994 In 1974, Skelton's interest in film work was rekindled with the news that Neil Simon's comedy The Sunshine Boys would become a movie; his last significant film appearance had been in Public Pigeon No. 1 in 1956. He screen tested for the role of Willy Clark with Jack Benny, who had been cast as Al Lewis. Although Simon had planned to cast Jack Albertson, who played Willy on Broadway, in the same role for the film, Skelton's screen test impressed him enough to change his mind. Skelton declined the part, however, reportedly due to an inadequate financial offer, and Benny's final illness forced him to withdraw as well. George Burns and Walter Matthau ultimately starred in the film. In 1981, Skelton made several specials for HBO including Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner (1981) and the Funny Faces series of specials. He gave a Royal Command Performance for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1984, which was later shown in the U.S. on HBO. A portion of one of his last interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast as part of the 2005 PBS special The Pioneers of Primetime. Skelton died on September 17, 1997, at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 84, after what was described as \\"a long, undisclosed illness\\". He is interred in the Skelton Family Tomb, the family's private room, alongside his son, Richard Freeman Skelton, Jr. and his second wife, Georgia Maureen Davis Skelton, in The Great Mausoleum's Sanctuary of Benediction at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Skelton was survived by his widow, Lothian Toland Skelton; his daughter, Valentina Marie Skelton Alonso; and granddaughter Sabrina Maureen Alonso. Art and other interests =Artwork= Skelton at home with one of his clown paintings in 1948 Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago department store that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one which Skelton described as \\"a bunch of blotches\\", he was told, \\"Ten thousand wouldn't buy that one.\\" He told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded him to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas where he was performing at the time. Skelton believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines. In addition to his originals, Skelton also sold reproductions and prints through his own mail order business. He made his work available to art galleries by selling them franchises to display and sell his paintings. He once estimated the sale of his lithographs earned him $2.5 million per year. Shortly after his death, his art dealer said he believed that Skelton made more money on his paintings than from his television work. At the time of his death, Skelton had produced over 1,000 oil paintings of clowns. When asked why his artwork focused on clowns, he said at first, \\"I don't know why it's always clowns.\\" He continued after thinking a moment by saying \\"No, that's not true‚ÄîI do know why. I just don't feel like thinking about it ...\\" At the time of Skelton's death, his originals were priced at $80,000 and upward. =Other interests= Skelton was a prolific writer of both short stories and music. After sleeping only four or five hours a night, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California. He owned a horse ranch in the Anza Valley. Fraternity and honors Skelton was a Freemason, a member of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was a member of both the Scottish and the York Rite. He was a recipient of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles. Skelton was made an honorary brother of Phi Sigma Kappa at Truman State University. In 1961 he became an honorary brother of the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity of Emerson College when he was awarded the Joseph E. Connor Award for excellence in the field of communications. He also received an honorary degree from the college at the same ceremony. Skelton received an honorary high school diploma from Vincennes High School. He was also an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity; Skelton had composed many marches which were used by more than 10,000 high school and college bands. In 1986, Skelton received an honorary degree from Ball State University. The Red Skelton Memorial Bridge spans the Wabash River and provides the highway link between Illinois and Indiana on U.S. Route 50, near Skelton's home town of Vincennes. He attended the dedication ceremonies in 1963. Awards and recognition Skelton's star for his work in television on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In 1952, Skelton received Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Program and Best Comedian. He also received an Emmy nomination in 1957 for his non-comedic performance in Playhouse 90's presentation of \\"The Big Slide\\". Skelton and his writers won another Emmy in 1961 for Outstanding Writing Achievement In Comedy. He was named an honorary faculty member of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College in 1968 and 1969. Skelton's first major post-television recognition came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named him as the recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. \\"I want to thank you for sitting down\\", he said when the ovation subsided. \\"I thought you were pulling a CBS and walking out on me.\\" The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves. Skelton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1987, and in 1988, he was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Television Hall of Fame. He was one of the International Clown Hall of Fame's first inductees in 1989. Skelton and Katharine Hepburn were honored with lifetime achievement awards by the American Comedy Awards in the same year. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994. Skelton also has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his radio and television work. Legacy and tributes Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comic: \\"A comedian goes out and hits people right on. A clown uses pathos. He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like.\\" \\"I just want to be known as a clown\\", he said, \\"because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything‚Äîsing, dance and above all, make people laugh.\\" His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh. In Groucho and Me, Groucho Marx called Skelton \\"the most unacclaimed clown in show business\\", and \\"the logical successor to [Charlie] Chaplin\\", largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. \\"With one prop, a soft battered hat\\", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, \\"he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red.\\" He added that Skelton also \\"plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors.\\" In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. \\"It's all so very different today. The whole business of comedy has changed ‚Äî from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton.\\" (PDF) Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures also praised Skelton, saying, \\"He's a clown in the old tradition. He doesn't need punch lines. He's got heart.\\" Skelton performing with Marcel Marceau, 1965; the two were friends for many years. Skelton and Marcel Marceau shared a long friendship and admiration of each other's work. Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn as the host in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three Funny Faces specials that Skelton produced for HBO. In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, \\"Red, you are eternal for me and the millions of people you made laugh and cry. May God bless you forever, my great and precious companion. I will never forget that silent world we created together.\\" CBS issued the following statement upon his death: \\"Red's audience had no age limits. He was the consummate family entertainer‚Äîa winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer and a dancer.\\" The Red Skelton Performing Arts Center was dedicated in February 2006 on the campus of Vincennes University, one block from the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born. The building includes an 850-seat theater, classrooms, rehearsal rooms, and dressing rooms. Its grand foyer is a gallery for Skelton's paintings, statues, and film posters. The theater hosts theatrical and musical productions by Vincennes University, as well as special events, convocations and conventions. The adjacent Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy opened on July 18, 2013, on what would have been Skelton's 100th birthday. It houses his personal and professional materials, which he had collected since the age of ten, in accordance with his wishes that they be made available in his hometown for the public's enjoyment. Skelton's widow, Lothian, noted that he expressed no interest in any sort of Hollywood memorial. The museum is funded jointly by the Red Skelton Museum Foundation and the Indiana Historical Society. Other Foundation projects include a fund that provides new clothes to Vincennes children from low-income families. The Foundation also purchased Skelton's birthplace. On July 15, 2017, the state of Indiana unveiled a state historic marker at the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born. The town of Vincennes has held an annual Red Skelton Festival since 2005. A \\"Parade of a Thousand Clowns\\", billed as the largest clown parade in the Midwest, is followed by family-oriented activities and live music performances. In 2006, Travis Tarrants purchased the historic Vincennes Pantheon Theatre, where Skelton performed during his youth. He established a non-profit organization with the hope of restoring the theatre to its 1921 state. Tarrants was able to raise close to $300,000 for the restoration. Two years later, donations for the project plummeted. Tarrants lost the theatre to unpaid back taxes in 2012 and the new owner was realtor Heath Klein. In late 2014, Klein sold the theatre property to a Vincennes non- profit group, INVin. The organization works to bring arts and arts-related businesses into downtown Vincennes. In March 2016, the group proposed to turn the theatre into shared workspace.

It is located east of Metro Manila, between the provinces of Laguna to the south and Rizal to the north. A freshwater lake, it has a surface area of 911‚Äì949 km¬≤ (352‚Äì366 sq mi), with an average depth of about and an elevation of about above sea level. The lake is shaped like a stylized 'W', with two peninsulas jutting out from the northern shore. Between these peninsulas, the middle lobe fills the large volcanic Laguna Caldera. In the middle of the lake is the large island of Talim, which falls under the jurisdiction of the towns of Binangonan and Cardona in Rizal province. The lake is one of the primary sources of freshwater fish in the country. Its water drains to Manila Bay via the Pasig River.  Etymology  The Laguna de Bay surrounded by the province of Laguna and Rizal and Metro Manila on the north-west; the town of Bay highlighted. Laguna de Bay means \\"Lagoon of [the town of] Bay\\" for the lakeshore town of Bay (pronounced as \\"B√§'√Ø\\"), the former provincial capital of Laguna province. Alternate spellings of the town's name include \\"Bae\\" or \\"Ba-i\\", and in the early colonial times, \\"Bayi\\" or \\"Vahi\\". Thus, the lake is sometimes spelled as \\"Laguna de Bae\\" or \\"Laguna de Ba-i\\", mostly by the locals. The town's name is believed to have come from the Tagalog word for \\"settlement\\" (bahayan), and is related to the words for \\"house\\" (bahay), \\"shore\\" (baybayin), and \\"boundary\\" (baybay), among others. The introduction of the English language during the American occupation of the Philippines, elicited confusion as the English word \\"bay\\", referring to another body of water, was mistakenly substituted to the town name that led to its mispronunciation. However, the word \\"Bay\\" in Laguna de Bay has always referred to the town. The Spanish word Laguna refers to not just lagoons but also for freshwater lakes, aside from lago.\\"Laguna\\". Spanish Dict. Retrieved on 2012-10-18. Some examples of the worldwide usage of laguna for lakes include Laguna Chicabal in Guatemala, Laguna de Gallocanta in Spain, Laguna Catemaco in Mexico and Laguna de Leche, the largest lake in Cuba. The lake's alternate name, \\"Laguna Lake\\", refers to the Province of Laguna, the province at the southern shore of the lake. Laguna province, though, was named because of the large lake and was originally called La Laguna till the early 20th century.U.S. Bureau of Census (1905). \\"Census of the Philippine Islands, 1903, Vol. II\\". Government Printing Office, Washington. In the pre-Hispanic era, the lake was known as \\"Puliran Kasumuran\\" (Laguna Copperplate Inscription, 900 AD), and later by \\"Pulilan\\" (Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, 1613. Pila, Laguna). Laguna Caldera Currently, the lake is often incorrectly called \\"Laguna Bay,\\" including in government websites, or \\"Laguna Lake\\" which is used by the Laguna Lake Development Authority. Geography The middle part of Laguna de Bay between Mount Sembrano and Talim Island, is the Laguna Caldera believed to have been formed by two major volcanic eruptions, around 1 million and 27,000‚Äì29,000 years ago.

Laguna de Bay is bordered by the province of Laguna in the east, west and southwest, the province of Rizal in the north to northeast, and Metropolitan Manila in the northwest. The lake has an average depth of and its excess water is discharged through the Pasig River.Gonzales, E.

In order to reduce the flooding in Manila along the Pasig River, during heavy rains, the peak water flows of the Marikina River are diverted via the Manggahan Floodway to Laguna de Bay, which serves as a temporary reservoir. In case the water level on the lake is higher than the Marikina River, the flow on the floodway is reversed, both Marikina River and the lake drain through Pasig River to Manila Bay.LLDA 1995, pp. 4‚Äì6. The lake has been used as a navigation lane for passenger boats since the Spanish colonial era. It is also used as a source of water for the Kalayaan Pumped-Storage Hydroelectric Project in Kalayaan, Laguna. Other uses include fishery, aquaculture, recreation, food support for the growing duck industry, irrigation and a \\"virtual\\" cistern for domestic, agricultural, and industrial effluents. Because of its importance in the development of the Laguna de Bay Region, unlike other lakes in the country, its water quality and general condition are closely monitored.Department of Environment and Natural Resources, 1996 This important water resource has been greatly affected by development pressures like population growth, rapid industrialization, and resources allocation.Batu, M.

Environmental issues At least 18 fish species are known from Laguna de Bay; none are strictly endemic to the lake, but 3 are endemic to the Philippines: Gobiopterus lacustris, Leiopotherapon plumbeus and Zenarchopterus philippinus. Aquaculture is widespread in Laguna de Bay, but often involves non-native species.Santos-Borja, A., and D.N. Nepomuceno (2005).

Because of the problems facing and threatening the potential of the lake, then President Ferdinand Marcos signed into law Republic Act (RA) 4850 in 1966 creating the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), the main agency tasked to oversee the programs that aimed to develop and protect Laguna de Bay.\\"Republic Act no. 4850\\". Laguna Lake Development Authority. Retrieved on 2012-10-22. Though it started as a mere quasi-government agency with regulatory and proprietary functions, its charter was strengthened by Presidential Decree (PD) 817 in 1975 and by Executive Order (EO) 927 in 1983 to include environmental protection and jurisdiction over the surface waters of the lake basin. In 1993, by virtue of the devolution, the administrative supervision of the LLDA was transferred to the DENR by EO 149.LLDA 2009, p. 9. Government data showed that about 60% of the estimated 8.4 million people residing in the Laguna de Bay Region discharge their solid and liquid wastes indirectly to the lake through its tributaries. A large percentage of these wastes are mainly agricultural while the rest are either domestic or industrialDENR, 1997 According to DENR (1997), domestic and industrial wastes contribute almost equally at 30% each. Meanwhile, agricultural wastes take up the remaining 40%. In a recent sensitivity waste load model ran by the Laguna Lake Development Authority's (LLDA) Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) division, it revealed that 70% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loadings came from households, 19% from industries, and 11% came from land run-off or erosion (LLDA, 2005). As far as industries and factories are concerned, there are about 1,481 and increase is expected. Of the said figure, about 695 have wastewater treatment facilities. Despite this, the lake is absorbing huge amounts of pollution from these industries in the forms of discharges of industrial cooling water, toxic spills from barges and transport operations, and hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, aluminum and cyanide.Sly, 1984 Based from the said figure, 65% are classified as ‚Äúpollutive‚Äù industries. The hastened agricultural modernization throughout the region took its toll on the lake. This paved the way for massive and intensified use of chemical based fertilizers and pesticides whose residues eventually find their way to the lake basin. These chemicals induce rapid algal growth in the area that depleted oxygen levels in the water. Hence, oxygen available to the lake is being used up thereby depleting the available oxygen for the fish, causing massive fish kills.Solidarity for People‚Äôs Power (1992) Laguna de bay: Racing against time. Pamphlet article. Los Ba√±os, Laguna, Philippines. As far as domestic wastes are concerned, around 10% of the 4,100 metric tons of waste generated by residents of Metro Manila are dumped into the lake, causing siltation of the lake. As reported by the now defunct Metropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), only 15% of the residents in the area have an effective waste disposal system. Moreover, around 85% of the families living along the shoreline do not have toilets and/or septic tanks. On January 29, 2008, the Mamamayan Para sa Pagpapanatili ng Pagpapaunlad ng Lawa ng Laguna (Mapagpala) accused the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) of the deterioration of Laguna de Bay due to multiplication of fish pens beyond the allowable limit.

Protection and conservation According to the Clean Water Act of 2004, the DENR (through the LLDA) shall implement a wastewater charge system in all management areas including the Laguna Lake region and Regional Industrial Centers through the collection of wastewater charges/fees. The system shall be established on the basis of payment to the government for discharging wastewater into the water bodies. Wastewater charges shall be established taking into consideration the following: a) to provide strong economic inducement for polluters to modify their production or management processes or to invest in pollution control technology in order to reduce the amount of water pollutants generated; b) to cover the cost of administering water quality management or improvement programs, including the cost of administering the discharge permitting and water pollution charge system; c) reflect damages caused by water pollution on the surrounding environment, including the cost of rehabilitation; d) type of pollutant; e) classification of the receiving water body; and f) other special attributes of the water body.Department of Environment and Natural Resources (2005). \\"Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Clean Water Act of 2004 (Republic Act no. 9275).\\" DENR Website.

Cultural impact  Laguna de Bay has had a significant impact on the cultures of the communities that grew up around its shores, ranging from folk medicine to architecture. For example, the traditional cure for a child constantly experiencing nose bleed in Victoria, Laguna is to have the child submerge his or her head in the lake water at daybreak. When nipa huts were more common, huts made in the lake area were constructed out of bamboo that would first be cured in the waters of Laguna de Bay. Some experts on the evolution of local mythologies suggest that the legend of Mariang Makiling may have started out as that of the Lady (Ba'i) of Laguna de Bay, before the legend was transmuted to Mount Makiling.

A master ad libber, Allen often tangled with his network's executives (and often barbed them on the air over the battles) while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, humorist James Thurber, and novelists William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and Herman Wouk (who began his career writing for Allen). Allen was honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for contributions to television and radio. Childhood John Florence Sullivan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Irish Catholic parents. Allen barely knew his mother, Cecilia Herlihy Sullivan, who died of pneumonia when he was not quite three years old. Along with his father, James Henry Sullivan, and his infant brother Robert, Allen was taken in by one of his mother's sisters, \\"my aunt Lizzie\\", around whom he focused the first chapter of his second memoir, Much Ado About Me. His father was so shattered by his mother's death that, according to Allen, he drank more heavily. His aunt suffered as well; her husband Michael was partially paralyzed by lead poisoning shortly after they married, leaving him mostly unable to work, something Allen remembered as causing contention among Lizzie's sisters. Eventually, Allen's father remarried and offered his sons the choice between coming with him and his new wife or staying with Aunt Lizzie. Allen's younger brother chose to go with their father, but Allen decided to stay with his aunt. \\"I never regretted it\\", he wrote.Allen, Fred, Much Ado About Me, Little brown & Co., 1956, pg. 21 Vaudeville Allen took piano lessons as a boy, his father having brought an Emerson upright along when they moved in with his aunt. He learned exactly two songs ‚Äì \\"Hiawatha\\" and \\"Pitter, Patter, Little Raindrops\\" ‚Äì and would be asked to play \\"half or all my repertoire\\" when visitors came to the house. He also worked at the Boston Public Library, where he discovered a book about the origin and development of comedy. Enduring various upheavals at home (other aunts came and went, prompting several moves), Allen also took up juggling while learning as much as possible about comedy. Some library co-workers planned to put on a show and asked him to do a bit of juggling and some of his comedy. When a girl in the crowd told him, \\"You're crazy to keep working here at the library; you ought to go on stage,\\" Allen decided his career path was set. Fred Allen with dummy, circa 1916. In 1914, at the age of 20, Allen took a job with a local piano company, in addition to his library work. He appeared at a number of amateur night competitions, soon taking the stage name Fred St. James and booking with the local vaudeville circuit at $30 a week, enough at that time to allow him to quit his jobs with the library and the piano company. Eventually he became \\"Freddy James,\\" often billing himself as the world's worst juggler. Allen refined the mix of his deliberately clumsy juggling and the standard jokes and one-liners, directing much of the humor at his own poor juggling abilities. During a ten-year world tour, his vaudeville act evolved more toward monologic comedy and less juggling. In 1917, returning to the New York circuit, his stage name was changed to Fred Allen so that he would not be offered the same low salary that theater owners had been accustomed to paying him in his early career. His new surname came from Edgar Allen, a booker for the Fox theaters.Allen, Fred, Much Ado About Me, Little brown & Co., 1956, pg. 203 In 1922, Allen commissioned comic-strip artist Martin Branner to cover a theater curtain with an elaborate mural painting depicting a cemetery with a punchline on each gravestone. This was the \\"Old Joke Cemetery\\", where overworked gags go to die. In Allen's act, the audiences would see the curtain (and have several minutes to read its 46 punchlines) before Allen made his entrance. Audiences typically would be laughing at the curtain before Allen even appeared. Robert Taylor's biography of Allen includes an impressive full- length photo of Branner's curtain painting, and many of the punchlines are clearly legible in the photo. Allen used a variety of gimmicks in his changing act, from a ventriloquist dummy to juggling to singing, but the focus was always on his comedy, which was heavy on wordplay. One recurring bit was to read a purported \\"letter from home\\" with material such as the following: :\\"The man next door has bought pigs; we got wind of it this morning. Your father had a terrible fight with him about it, and the man hit your father with a rock in the left ear. It didn't bother your father; he is stone deaf in that ear. The policeman who took him away said that he would get his hearing in the morning. The other man, the one who owns the pigs, was arrested for fragrancy... There is no other news except that our oil stove exploded yesterday and blew your father and me out into the backyard. It is the first time we have been out together for twenty years.\\" Allen's wit was at times not intended for the vaudeville audience but rather for other professionals in show business. After one of his appearances failed one day, Allen made the best of it by circulating an obituary of his act on black-bordered funeral stationery. He also mailed vials of his supposed flop sweat to newspapers as part of his comic self-promotion. In 1921 Fred Allen and Nora Bayes toured with the company of Lew Fields. Their musical director was a nineteen-year-old Richard Rodgers. Many years later, when he and Oscar Hammerstein II appeared as mystery guests on What's My Line?, Rodgers recalled Allen's act, sitting on the edge of the stage, his legs dangling down, playing a banjo while telling jokes.Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?, Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube Broadway Allen gave vaudeville itself a timeline of 1875‚Äì1925 in Much Ado About Me, but he actually left vaudeville a few years earlier, moving to work in such Shubert Brothers stage productions as The Passing Show in 1922. The show played well in its runup to Broadway but lasted only ten weeks at the Winter Garden Theatre. Allen did, however, take something far more lasting from the show: one of the show's chorus girls, Portland Hoffa, who became his wife in 1927 and remained with him until his death. He also took good notices for his comic work in several of the productions, particularly Vogues and Greenwich Village Follies, and continued to develop his comic writing, even writing a column for Variety called \\"Near Fun.\\" A salary dispute ended the column; Allen wanted only $60 a week to give up his theater work to become a full-time columnist, but his editor tried a sleight-of-hand based on the paper's ad rates to deny him. He spent his summer in Boston, honed his comic and writing skills even further, worked in a respectfully received duo that billed themselves as Fink and Smith, and played a few of the dying vaudeville houses. Allen returned to New York to the pleasant surprise that Portland Hoffa was taking instruction to convert to Roman Catholicism. After the couple married, Allen began writing material for them to use together (\\"With a vaudeville act, Portland and I could be together, even if we couldn't find any work\\"), and the couple divided their time between the show business circuit, Allen's New England family home and Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in summers. Radio Fred Allen's first taste of radio came while he and Portland Hoffa waited for a promised slot in a new Arthur Hammerstein musical. In the interim, they appeared on a Chicago station's program, WLS Showboat, into which Allen recalled, \\"Portland and I were presented... to inject a little class into it.\\" Their success in these appearances helped their theater reception; live audiences in the Midwest liked to see their radio favorites in person, even if Allen and Hoffa would be replaced by Bob Hope when the radio show moved to New York several months afterward. Allen playing the tuba, date unknown. The couple eventually got their Hammerstein show, Polly, which opened in Delaware and made the usual tour before hitting Broadway. Also in that cast was a young Englishman named Archie Leach, who received as many good notices for his romantic appeal as Allen got for his comic work. Hammerstein retooled the show before bringing it to New York, replacing everyone but two women and Allen. Leach decided to buy an old car and drive to Hollywood. \\"What Archie Leach didn't tell me,\\" Allen remembered, \\"was that he was going to change his name to Cary Grant.\\" Polly never succeeded in spite of several retoolings, but Allen did go on to successful shows like The Little Show (1929‚Äì30) and Three's a Crowd (1930‚Äì31), which eventually led to his full-time entry to radio in 1932. =Town Hall Tonight= Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, moving the show to NBC and becoming The Salad Bowl Revue (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann's Mayonnaise, which was marketed by the parent company of Linit) later in the year. The show became The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933‚Äì34), The Hour of Smiles (1934‚Äì35), and finally Town Hall Tonight (1935‚Äì39). In 1939‚Äì40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to The Fred Allen Show, over his objections. Allen's perfectionism (odd to some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until Town Hall Tonight allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star. Publicity photo for the premiere of Texaco Star Theater, 1940. The hour-long show featured segments that would influence radio and, much later, television; news satires such as Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In's \\"Laugh-In Looks at the News\\" and Saturday Night Live's \\"Weekend Update\\" were influenced by Town Hall Tonight's \\"The News Reel\\", later renamed \\"Town Hall News\\" (and in 1939‚Äì40, as a sop to his sponsor, \\"Ipana News\\"). The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson's \\"Mighty Carson Art Players\\" routines referenced Allen's Mighty Allen Art Players, in name and sometimes in routines. Allen and company also satirized popular musical comedies and films of the day, including and especially Oklahoma!. Allen also did semi-satirical interpretations of well-known lives--including his own. The show that became Town Hall Tonight was the longest-running hour-long comedy-based show in classic radio history. In 1940, Allen moved back to CBS Radio with a new sponsor and show name, Texaco Star Theater, airing every Wednesday at 9:00 pm ET on CBS, then Sundays at 9:00 pm in the fall of 1941. By 1942, he shortened the show to half an hour, at 9:30 pm ET--under network and sponsor edict, not his own. He also chafed under being forced to give up a Town Hall Tonight signature, using barely known and amateur guests effectively, in favor of booking more recognizable guests, though he liked many of those. Guests included singers from Kingston, New York, the original woman behind the \\"Aunt Jemima\\" on pancake boxes, and more guests up the road--from Saugerties, like the singer, Donald Gardner. =Back to NBC= He took over a year off due to hypertension and returned in 1945 with The Fred Allen Show on NBC, Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. EST. Standard Brands' Blue Bonnet Margarine & Tenderleaf Tea, and later, Ford Motor Company, were the sponsors for the rest of the show's life. (Texaco revived Texaco Star Theater in 1948 on radio, and more successfully on television, making an American icon out of star Milton Berle). Allen again made a few changes, including the singing DeMarco Sisters, to whom he'd been tipped by arranger-composer Gordon Jenkins. \\"We did four years with Mr. Allen and got one thousand dollars a week,\\" Gloria DeMarco remembered. \\"Sunday night was the best night on radio.\\" Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night listeners didn't hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became as familiar as their cheerfully sung \\"Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn\\" in the show's opening theme. During the theme's brief pause, Allen would say something like, \\"It isn't the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga, kiddies.\\"a sarcastic jab at a running gag on fellow- comedian Jack Benny's show. That device became a signature for three of the four years. =Allen's Alley= The other change, born in the Texaco days and evolving from his earlier news spoofs, proved his most enduring, premiering December 6, 1942. The inspiration for the mythical Main Street of \\"Allen's Alley\\" came from the small-town heartland folks who were often profiled in the newspaper columns written by O. O. McIntyre (1884‚Äì1938), one of the most popular columnists of the 1930s with some seven million readers.Cullen, Frank, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly. Vaudeville, Old and New, Routledge, 2007. \\"Allen's Alley\\" followed a brief Allen monologue and comic segment with Portland Hoffa (\\"Misssss-ter Allll-llennnn!\\"), usually involving gags about her family which she instigated. Then a brief music interlude would symbolize the two making their way to the fictitious Alley. The Allen's Alley cast (l to r): Fred Allen, Kenny Delmar, Minerva Pious, Peter Donald, Parker Fennelly. The segment was always launched by a quick exchange that began with Hoffa asking Allen what he would ask the Alley denizens that week. After she implored him, \\"Shall we go?\\" Allen would reply with cracks like, \\"As the two drumsticks said when they spotted the tympani, let's beat it!'\\"; or \\"As one strapless gown said to the other strapless gown, 'What's holding us up?'\\" A small host of stereotypical characters greeted Allen and Hoffa down the Alley, discussing Allen's question of the week, usually drawing on news items or popular happenings around town, whether gas rationing, traffic congestion, the Pulitzer Prizes, postwar holiday travel, or the annual Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus visit. The Alley went through a few changes in the first installments. Early denizens included sarcastic John Doe (John Brown), self-possessed Senator Bloat and town drunk Sampson Souse (Jack Smart), dimwitted Socrates Mulligan (Charlie Cantor), pompous poet Falstaff Openshaw (Alan Reed), and wry Jewish housewife Pansy Nussbaum (Minerva Pious). By 1945, Pious and Reed were joined by two new Alley denizens: Parker Fennelly as stoic New England farmer Titus Moody, and Kenny Delmar, the new show's announcer, as bellowing Southern senator Beauregard Claghorn. Pious is credited with tipping Allen to Delmar, who based the character on a real-life person he had encountered while hitchhiking in 1928. Within weeks, Claghorn became one of the leading comedy characters of radio as listeners across the country began quoting his catchphrases: \\"Somebody, Ah say, somebody knocked\\"; \\"I'm from the South, Suh\\"; \\"That's a joke, son\\"; and \\"Pay attention, boy!\\" Claghorn served as the model for the Warner Bros. cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn, who first appeared the following August in the Oscar-nominated Walky Talky Hawky. Other characters had catchphrases that were almost as famous as Claghorn's, such as Titus Moody's \\"Howdy, Bub\\", and Falstaff Openshaw's \\"That is precisely why I am here.\\" Mrs. Nussbaum always greeted Allen by saying, \\"You were expecting maybe...\\", and then she would mispronounce the name of a glamorous film star, such as \\"...Tulalulalula Bankhead?\\". The Alley sketches made only one further cast change, when Peter Donald's chipper Irishman Ajax Cassidy succeeded Reed's Falstaff. The show was popular enough for Ford Motor Company to feature it in a Life magazine ad in April 1948. Despite the ethnic diversity, the Alley characters seemed less citified and more akin with O. O. McIntyre's small-town America. Allen's topical humor is sometimes thought an acquired taste for audiences curious about his generation of radio stars; Dunning has written that when he \\"went into topical humor, he may have forfeited his only opportunity to be the Mark Twain of his century. He had flashes of undeniable brilliance. But the main body of his work deals with the day-to-day fodder of another time, and sons have seldom been amused by the embarrassments or tragedies of their fathers.\\" But others find many parallels to today's world and its absurdities. The \\"Allen's Alley\\" stereotypes make some cringe, as Allen biographer Robert Taylor noted (in Fred Allen: His Life and Wit), but others find them lancing more than lauding stereotypes, letting listeners make up their own minds about how foolish they could be. \\"Interestingly enough,\\" wrote Frank Buxton and Bill Owen in The Big Broadcast 1920-1950, \\"[Claghorn, Nussbaum, Moody, and Cassidy] were never criticized as being anti-Southern, anti-Semitic, anti-New England or anti-Irish. The warmth and good humor with which they were presented made them acceptable even to the most sensitive listeners.\\" Allen employed a writing staff but they served as his sounding boards and early draft consultants as much as actual writers; it was Allen who had the final edit and rewrite of each week's script, working as long as twelve hours a day in his own right on ideas or sketches. His ad-libbing ability caused many a show to fade away behind the ending network identification, because Allen often ate up air time. It was not as unusual for him as for others to sign off with \\"We're a little late, so good night, folks.\\" Buxton and Owen believed the Allen show needed it more than anyone else of his era. Allen also \\"died\\" more eloquently than other radio comics, particularly in the later years. When a joke was greeted with an awkward silence, Allen would comment on the lack of response, with his ad-libbed \\"explanation\\" almost always funnier than the original joke, a technique later adopted successfully by Johnny Carson. =Closing the Alley= The Fred Allen Show was radio's top-rated show of the 1946-47 season. Allen was able to negotiate a lucrative new contract as a result not only of the show's success, but thanks in large measure to NBC's anxiety to keep more of its stars from joining Jack Benny in a wholesale defection to CBS as well as to retain their services for their rapidly expanding television programming. The CBS talent raids broke up NBC's hit Sunday night, and Benny also convinced George Burns and Gracie Allen and Bing Crosby to join his move. But a year later, he was knocked off his perch, not by a talent raid but by a show on a third rival network, ABC (the former NBC Blue network). The quiz show Stop the Music, hosted by Bert Parks (debuted 1948), required listeners to participate live by telephone. The show became a big enough hit to break into Allen's grip on that Sunday night time slot. At first, Allen fought fire with his own kind of fire: he offered $5,000 to any listener getting a call from Stop the Music or any similar game show while listening to The Fred Allen Show. He never had to pay up, nor was he shy about lampooning the game show phenomenon (especially a riotous parody of another quiz show Parks hosted, lancing Break the Bank in a routine called \\"Break the Contestant\\" in which players didn't receive a thing but were compelled to give up possessions when they blew a question). Unfortunately, Allen fell to number 38 in the radio ratings, his fall compounded by the rise of television in many major cities. By this time, he had changed the show again somewhat, changing the famed \\"Allen's Alley\\" skits to take place on \\"Main Street,\\" and rotating a new character or two in and out of the lineup. He stepped down from radio again in 1949, at the end of his show's regular season, as much under his doctor's orders as because of his slipping ratings. He decided to take a year off, but it did more for his health (he suffered from hypertension) than his career; after the June 26, 1949 show, on which Henry Morgan and Jack Benny guested, Fred Allen never hosted another radio show full-time again. =Feud= Good friends in real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny inadvertently hatched a running gag in 1937 when a child prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about \\"a certain alleged violinist\\" who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air (\\"Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts\\" was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. The rivalry gag went on for a decade and convinced some fans that the two comedians really were blood enemies. The Allen-Benny feud was the longest-playing, best-remembered dialogic running gag in classic radio history.By far the longest-running sound gag in radio had to be Fibber McGee's clattering cluttered closet The gag even pushed toward a boxing match between the two comedians and the promised event was a sellout, though the match never occurred. The pair even appeared together in films, including Love Thy Neighbor (1940) and It's in the Bag! (1945), Allen's only starring vehicle, also featuring William Bendix, Robert Benchley, and Jerry Colonna. He also starred with Oscar Levant in 20th Century-Fox's anthology film O. Henry's Full House, starring in the best filmed version to date of The Ransom of Red Chief. Some of the feud's highlights involved Al Boasberg, who is credited with helping Benny refine his character into what may have been America's first stand-up comedian. Boasberg was well known behind the scenes as a top comedy writer and script doctor, but he seldom received recognition in public. He worked, uncredited, on many films (including the Marx Brothers' hits A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races). Steaming mad because of his long battles for recognition, Boasberg was said to have delivered a tirade that ended up (in slightly altered form) in an Allen-Benny feud routine: > Allen: Why, you fugitive from a Ripley cartoon ... I'll knock you flatter > than the first eight minutes of this program. Benny: You ought to do well in > pictures, Mr. Allen, now that Boris Karloff is back in England. Allen: Why, > if I was a horse, a pony even, and found out that any part of my tail was > used in your violin bow, I'd hang my head in my oatbag from then on. Benny's side of the feud included a tart interpretation of Allen's Town Hall Tonight show, which Benny and company called \\"Clown Hall Tonight.\\" A signature element of the feud was that, whenever one guested on the other's shows, the host would tend to hand the guest the best lines of the night. (Both Benny and Allen revealed later that each man's writers consulted with each other on routines involving the feud.) They toned the gag down after 1941, though they kept it going often enough as the years continued, climaxing on Allen's May 26, 1946 show, in which a sketch called \\"King for a Day,\\" satirizing big-money game shows, featured Benny pretending to be a contestant named Myron Proudfoot on Allen's new quiz show. > Allen: Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle > to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning > contest. Benny (rapturously): I'm KING for a Day! [Allen proceeds to have > Benny's clothes pressed:] Allen: And that's not all! Benny: There's more? > Allen: Yes! On our stage we have a Hoffman pressing machine. Benny: Now wait > a minute! Wait a minute! Allen: An expert operating the Hoffman pressing > machine will press your trousers in seconds. Benny: NOW WAIT A MINUTE!!! > (total audience hysteria and laughter, as Benny's pants are literally > removed) Allen: Quiet, King! Benny: Come on, Allen, give me my pants! Allen: > Keep your shirt on, King. Benny: You bet I'll keep my shirt on! Allen: We're > a little late, folks! Tune in next week ‚Äì Benny: Allen, this is a frame ‚Äì > (starts laughing himself) Where are my pants! Allen: Benny, for 15 years > I've been waiting to catch you like this! Benny: Allen, you haven't seen the > end of me! Allen: It won't be long now! Benny: I want my pants! Allen and Benny couldn't resist one more play on the feud on Allen's final show. Benny appeared as a skinflint bank manager and mortgage company owner bedeviling Henry Morgan. Typically, Allen handed Benny the show's best crack: \\"Nobody ever made me this cheap on my own program!\\" Benny even used the feud on his TV show, when Fred Allen appeared as a special guest in 1953. The program depicted Benny and Allen as rivals for the sponsor's favors. When the sponsor pointed out that Benny was also a musician, Allen countered with a passage on his clarinet. As Benny said in his co-memoir, Sunday Nights at Seven: The Jack Benny Story (1990; his daughter, Joan, added her own recollections and published the book after Benny's death), \\"[T]he sky was the limit. Or rather, the mud was the limit.\\" Benny was profoundly shaken by Allen's sudden death by heart attack in 1956. In a statement released the day after Allen's death, Benny said, \\"People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it.\\" =Censorship= Allen may have battled censors more than most of his radio contemporaries. \\"Fred Allen's fourteen-year battle with radio censorship,\\" wrote the New York Herald-Tribune critic John Crosby, \\"was made particularly difficult for him by the fact that the man assigned to reviewing his scripts had little sense of humor and frankly admitted he didn't understand Allen's peculiar brand of humor at all.\\" Among the blue pencils, according to Crosby, were: * Allen was barred from saying \\"Brenda never looked lovelier\\", at the time of socialite Brenda Frazier's wedding, unless he could get direct permission from the Frazier family itself. * Allen was ordered to change the Cockney accent he assigned the character of a first mate aboard the Queen Mary ‚Äî on the grounds that the ship's first mate could only be a cultured man who might not like a Cockney accent. * Allen had to fight to keep Mrs. Nussbaum in the Allen's Alley routines, because NBC feared Jewish-dialect humor \\"might offend all Jews\\", despite the fact that Jewish dialect humor had been a vaudeville and burlesque staple for years. * Allen was ordered to not even mention the fictitious town of North Wrinkle until or unless it could be proven that no such town actually did exist. \\"Allen not only couldn't poke fun at individuals\\", Crosby wrote, \\"he also had to be careful not to step on their professions, their beliefs, and sometimes even their hobbies and amusements. Portland Hoffa was once given a line about wasting an afternoon at the rodeo. NBC objected to the implication that an afternoon at the rodeo was wasted and the line had to be changed. Another time, Allen gagged that a girl could have found a better husband in a cemetery. (The censor) thought this might hurt the feelings of people who own and operate cemeteries. Allen got the line cleared only after pointing out that cemeteries have been topics for comedy since the time of Aristophanes.\\" Allen's constant and sometimes intense‚Äîas well as often ridiculous‚Äîbattles with censors may have aggravated his longtime problems with hypertension. Life after the Alley After his own show ended, Allen became a regular attraction on NBC's The Big Show (1950‚Äì1952), hosted by Tallulah Bankhead. He appeared on 24 of the show's 57 installments, including the landmark premiere, and showed he had not lost his trademark ad-lib skill or his rapier wit. (The show's head writer, Goodman Ace, later told radio host Richard Lamparski that Allen's lucrative NBC contract was a large factor in getting him on the show, though Allen also wrote the segments on which he appeared and consulted with the respected Ace and staff on other portions of the show.) In some ways, The Big Show was an offspring of the old Allen show; his one-time Texaco Star Theater announcer, Jimmy Wallington, was one of The Big Show's announcers, and Portland Hoffa made several appearances with him as well. On the show's premiere, Allen ‚Äì with a little prodding from head writer Goodman Ace ‚Äì could not resist one more play on the old Allen-Benny \\"feud,\\" a riotous parody of Benny's show called \\"The Pinch Penny Program.\\" Television It was also on The Big Show's premiere that Allen delivered perhaps his best-remembered crack about television: \\"You know, television is called a new medium, and I have discovered why they call it a Medium ‚Äì because nothing is Well Done.\\" That did not stop the Museum of Broadcast Communications from considering Allen \\"the intellectual conscience of television.\\" Aside from his famous crack about not liking furniture that talked, Allen observed that television allowed \\"people who haven't anything to do to watch people who can't do anything.\\" Allen tried three short-lived television projects of his own, including a bid to bring \\"Allen's Alley\\" to television in a visual setting similar to Our Town. NBC apparently rejected the idea out of hand. \\"Television is a triumph of equipment over people,\\" Allen observed after that, \\"and the minds that control it are so small that you could put them in the navel of a flea and still have enough room beside them for a network vice president's heart.\\" His other two TV tries were quiz shows. Judge for Yourself (subtitled The Fred Allen Show) was a game show incorporating musical acts. The idea was to allow Allen to ad-lib with guests √† la Groucho Marx, but the complicated format had to be revamped in the middle of the run. (The star was \\"lost in the confusion of a half hour filled with too many people and too much activity,\\" wrote Alan Havig.) A comedy series, Fred Allen's Sketchbook, did not catch on. He landed a two-year stint as a panelist on the CBS quiz show What's My Line? from 1954 until his death on March 17, 1956. Allen actually appeared as a Mystery Guest on What's My Line? on July 17, 1955, when he was taking a week off from the show to have an emergency appendectomy. Afterwards he joked about the operation: \\"It was an emergency. The doctor needed some money hurriedly.\\" Allen also spent his final years as a newspaper columnist/humorist and as a memoirist, renting a small New York office to work six hours a day without distractions. He wrote Treadmill to Oblivion (1954, reviewing his radio and television years) and Much Ado About Me (1956, covering his childhood and his vaudeville and Broadway years, and detailing especially vaudeville at its height with surprising objectivity); the former--which included many of his vintage radio scripts--was the best-selling book on radio's classic period for many years. After the frustrations and failures of his attempts to succeed on television, the popularity of Treadmill revealed Allen's potential as a literary humorist. Film Allen had a relatively minor career on screen, appearing in 7 full- length features and 3 shorts between 1929 and 1952. His first feature film was the 1935 Dick Powell musical comedy Thanks a Million, which The New York Times reviewed, naming only Allen in their headline.Andre Sennwald, The New York Times, Movie Review: \\"Thanks a Million,\\" an Amusing Political Lampoon With Fred Allen, at the Center Theatre.

Death The headstone of Fred Allen in Gate of Heaven Cemetery Taking one of his regular late night strolls up New York's West 57th Street on Saturday night, March 17, 1956, Allen suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 61. A popular myth repeated for many years, first published in The New York Times story appearing the day after Allen's death, was that he had died while walking his dog. However, biographer Robert Taylor later revealed that Allen had never owned a dog. Allen died before he could complete the final chapter of his memoirs, and as a result the book was published as he had left it. He was a tireless letter writer, and his letters were edited by his wife into the publication of Fred Allen's Letters in 1965. During the following night's regular Sunday broadcast of What's My Line? at 10:30 p.m., barely 24 hours following Allen's death, host John Daly preceded the program with a special message to the viewing audience. He stated that earlier in the day the producers had considered replacing the regular game play with a special memorial episode, but Allen's wife Portland Hoffa stated that she preferred the show be conducted as it always had been, indicating that this is what Allen would have wanted. The program then proceeded as normal, but with a noticeably subdued tone. Steve Allen (no relation) took Fred's chair on the panel. During the final ninety seconds of the program Steve Allen, Arlene Francis and Bennett Cerf (whose eyes began to tear) gave brief but heartfelt tributes to Fred. A somber Dorothy Kilgallen thanked Steve Allen for stepping in and helping them to carry on at a difficult moment; a similar on-air farewell would air after Kilgallen herself died unexpectedly in 1965. Fred Allen is buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. Both his real and stage names are engraved on the headstone. Allen has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a radio star at 6713 Hollywood Blvd. and a TV star at 7001 Hollywood Blvd. His widow, Portland Hoffa, married bandleader Joe Rines in 1959 and celebrated a second silver wedding anniversary well before her own death of natural causes in Los Angeles on Christmas Day, 1990. Allen was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. A pedestrian passageway in the Boston Theater District, designated \\"Allen's Alley\\", also honors his memory. Cultural legacy Several late-'30s Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts feature parodies of Allen. Friz Freleng's Toy Town Hall (1936) is a spoof of Allen's Town Hall Tonight, with toys that come to life in a boy's dreams and put on a variety show. Frank Tashlin's The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (1937) features a Fred Allen fox screaming about being misinformed, hinting about his heated feuds with censors who were often at the last minute forcing script changes on his show because of its content. And Tex Avery's Thugs with Dirty Mugs (1938) features the main character addressing the audience and showing them his Fred Allen impersonation in one scene. In Action Comics #50 (July 1942), Superman quips, \\"Fred Allen would get a kick out of this!\\" as he hops on to the side of a moving train. Bibliography *Allen, Fred.

She was a Nagasaki Japanese who lived most of her life in the coastal town of Hirado, then later migrated to China.  Giving birth by the stone  Tagawa Matsu was a Japanese woman from a samurai family in Hirado. Tagawa met and married a Han Chinese Hoklo named Zheng Zhilong from Nan'an, Fujian, China who frequently traded with the Japanese in Nagasaki. They fell in love with each other and married. Zheng Zhilong was said to be \\"very good looking\\" and when he first came to Japan he was 18 years old. Tagawa was a few years older than Zheng and she was in her early twenties when they met. There are different accounts on how they met. In one of them she, along with other Japanese girls from Samurai families, were waiting on the Daimy≈ç Matsuura at an evening party when she met Zheng. The meeting may have been deliberately arranged by Matsuura or her parents to help marry her off to a foreigner. In another he met Tagawa while talking to girls along the beach in Hirado. In another, Tagawa, an Ashigaru's daughter, was given to him by the daimy≈ç. Another one by Liu Xianting (ÂäâÁçªÂª∑) in Guangyang Zaji (Âª£ÈôΩÈõúË®ò) said that Tagawa was a widow when she met Zheng. It said that Zheng Zhilong fled to Japan when he was young and worked as a tailor. He lost his life savings of three coppers on a road and was looking for them but couldn't find them. He started crying but a Japanese widow who was standing inside the gate of her house saw him and asked him what was wrong. Zheng Zhilong told her and then she said to him \\"With your skill, you could easily make 3 million coppers, how could you arrive at this situation over 3 coppers?\\" She then invited Zheng to spend the night with her and they gave themselves to each other.ÂäâÁçªÂª∑ Âª£ÈôΩÈõúË®ò Âç∑‰∫å ÈÑ≠ËäùÈæçÂπºÈÄÉÂÖ•Êó•Êú¨ÔºåÁÇ∫‰∫∫Á∏´Á¥âÔºå‰ª•Á≥äÂÖ∂Âè£„ÄÇ‰ΩôË≤≤‰∏âÈå¢ÔºåÁ∏´Ë°£È†ò‰∏≠ÔºåÂ§±ÂéªÔºåÊóÅÁöáÊñºË∑Ø‰ª•Ê±Ç‰πãÔºå‰∏çÂæóËÄåÊ≥£„ÄÇÊúâÂÄ≠Â©¶Êñ∞ÂØ°ÔºåÁ´ãÊñºÈñÄÂÖßÔºåË¶ãËÄåÂïè‰πãÔºåËäùÈæçÂëä‰ª•ÊïÖ„ÄÇÂ©¶Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ª•Ê±ùÊùêÂäõÔºå‰∏âÁôæËê¨‰∫¶Â¶ÇÊãæËä•Ôºå‰∏âÈå¢‰ΩïËá≥ÊñºÊòØÔºü„ÄçËìãÂÖ∂Â©¶Â§úÊúâÁï∞Â§¢Â¶ÇÈüìËòÑÁéã‰πãÂ§´‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÈÅÇ‰ª•ÂéöË≤≤Ë¥à‰πãÔºåËÄåËàá‰πãÂ§úÂêà„ÄÇËäùÈæçÂæåÂæóÂøóÔºåÂèñ‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂÆ§ÔºåÂç≥Ë≥úÂßì‰πãÊØç‰πü„ÄÇ She gave birth to Koxinga during a trip with her husband when she was picking seashells on the Senli Beach, Sennai River Bank (Â∑ùÂÖßÊµ¶ÂçÉÈáåÊø±), Hirado.

Tagawa was the first woman Zheng fell in love with and they were viewed as having a common-law marriage already. However, the group of traders working with Captain China wanted to arrange for a Chinese woman, Lady Yan to marry Zheng Zhilong. After the birth of Koxinga, she was still visited in Japan by Zheng Zhilong sometimes according to sources from their time. She had another son named Shichizaemon in 1629 and gave him her family's surname, Tagawa. Sources say that Zheng Zhilong was the father and that he visited Hirado to impregnate her with Shichizayemon and that he received the surname Tagawa because he was adopted by Tagawa Matsu's parents but others say Shichizaemon was the product of an unknown Japanese man which is why he was given Tagawa's surname and not Zheng. He became an ashigaru samurai. The Taiwan Waiji does not mention Shichizaemon.Sazvar, Nastaran. ‚ÄúZHENG CHENGGONG (1624-1662): EIN HELD IM WANDEL DER ZEIT: DIE VERZERRUNG EINER HISTORISCHEN FIGUR DURCH MYTHISCHE VERKL√ÑRUNG UND POLITISCHE INSTRUMENTALISIERUNG.‚Äù Monumenta Serica, vol. 58, 2010, pp. 165.

Tagawa Matsu raised Koxinga in Japan by herself until he was seven, and her closeness with her son is evident in some of the accomplishment and decisions Koxinga made in his adult life.

Until her last breath she thought of the honor of Japan.\\" The Japanese claim she committed suicide while fighting and that she preferred \\"death\\" and had the \\"Yamato spirit\\" while what really occurred is unknown because of the many different versions offered from different sources. The Japanese Foreign Affairs association during World War II cited Tagawa as an example of a Japanese who had \\"the spirit of facing certain death in order to live up to a cherished cause\\". The Qing being responsible for killing Tagawa was something Zheng Zhilong had to live with since he did not know the Qing were going to kill her. The Qing did not trust him because they were the ones who got Tagawa killed so he might turn against the Qing if they let him go. His Japanese blood is believed to be the cause for his violent propensity according to a Spanish missionary.

This is unlikely, as this would necessitate either Weng Yihuang moving to Japan (but he was an ironsmith, neither a sailor nor a trader) or the migration of the Tagawa women back and forth between the two nations (but traveling of women was restricted). =Adopted theory= Other sources say that Weng Yihuang was her stepfather, that Weng Yihuang married Tagawa Matsu's widowed Japanese mother after Tagawa Matsu's Japanese father died and adopted her as his stepdaughter.ÊπØÈå¶Âè∞„ÄäÈñãÂïüÂè∞ÁÅ£Á¨¨‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÈÑ≠ËäùÈæç„ÄãÔºåÈ†Å‰∏ÉÂçÅ‰∫î„ÄÇ‰ºäËÉΩÂòâÁü©„ÄäÂè∞ÁÅ£ÊñáÂåñË™å„ÄãÔºö„ÄåÊúâÊ≥âÂ∑ûÈêµÂå†ÁøÅÁøäÁöáÂÖ∂‰∫∫ÔºåÊõæÂØÑÂØìÊñºÂπ≥Êà∂ËÄåÊ≠∏ÂåñÊñºÊó•Êú¨ÔºåÂõ†ÁÑ°Â≠êËÄå‰ª•Áî∞Â∑ùÊ∞è‰πãÂ•≥ÁÇ∫Â≠ê„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÈñìÈÑ≠ËäùÈæçÁñäÊ¨°‰æÜÈÅäÔºåÈÅÇÂ®∂Ê≠§Â•≥‰∫ë„ÄÇ„ÄçÂè≤Á±ç‰∏≠ÁÑ°Áî∞Â∑ù‰πãÂêçË´±„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÁî±Âπ≥Êà∂Â∏ÇÊïôËÇ≤ÂßîÂì°ÊúÉÊâÄË£Ω‰ΩúÁöÑÂ∞éË¶ΩÁâå‰∏äÔºåÂâáÁ®±„ÄåÈÑ≠ËäùÈæçÂíåÂπ≥Êà∂ÁöÑÂ•≥ÊÄßÔºàÂÇ≥Ë™™ÁÇ∫„ÄåÁî∞Â∑ù„Éû„ÉÑ„ÄçÔºâÁîü‰∏ãÈÑ≠ÊàêÂäü„ÄÇ„Äç„Äå„Éû„ÉÑ„ÄçÂç≥„ÄåÊùæ„Äç„ÄÇ =Prostitute or Princess= The Zheng family's enemies attacked Tagawa by suggesting she was a Japanese prostitute Zheng Zhilong picked up, while Tagawa's Japanese descendants claim she was a descendant of the Japanese Imperial family. This traces her descent to Japan's 50th Emperor, Kammu Tenno, 19 generations from Tagawa Matsu through Taira no Shigemori and Tagawa Yazayemon Áî∞Â∑ù Âº•Â∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ. The English diplomat R. A. B Posonby-Fane pushed the theory that Tagawa was a Japanese woman from a high class Samurai background. It is agreed by modern historians that she was neither and that she was a Japanese girl from an average Samurai family, not of high rank and not a prostitute.Sazvar, Nastaran. ‚ÄúZHENG CHENGGONG (1624‚Äì1662): EIN HELD IM WANDEL DER ZEIT: DIE VERZERRUNG EINER HISTORISCHEN FIGUR DURCH MYTHISCHE VERKL√ÑRUNG UND POLITISCHE INSTRUMENTALISIERUNG.‚Äù Monumenta Serica, vol. 58, 2010, pp. 160‚Äì161.

There is no proof for either the accusation that she was a prostitute or the claim that she was of aristocratic descent. Donald Keene pointed out that there was a real marriage between Zheng Zhilong and Miss Tagawa despite Zheng also later marrying a Chinese woman, so she was not a prostitute or a courtesan. =Samurai= Japanese sources say she was full blooded Japanese. Japanese sources say that her samurai father was either Lord Matsuura's Samurai Tagawa Yazayemon or her father's name was Tagawa Shichizaemon whom she named her second son after.http://crd.ndl.go.jp/reference/modules/d3ndlcrdentry/index.php?page=ref_view&id;=1000151732http://crd.ndl.go.jp/reference/detail?page=ref_view&id;=1000151732 According to stories passed down by Japanese in Hirado, Tagawa Matsu's father was Tagawa Shichizaemon (Áî∞Â∑ù‰∏ÉÂ∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ) whom she named her second son after. The samurai Tagawa Yazayemon was an ashigaru according to Hirado folklore and there was nothing else describing him as that according to Inagaki. In Taiyo, an article was written by Matsui Nobuaki which said that Tagawa Yazayemon was not Tagawa Matsu's father but instead her father was Tagawa Shichizayemon. Wong said he cannot link her to the Ashigaru or the Tagawa samurai family. The Tokugawa Japanese Shogunate compiled work, the Account of the Keicho Era (Keicho shosetsu) says that \\"While Zhilong was initially in Hirado, he married a woman, n√©e Tagawa of a samurai family.\\"  Descendants  In Koxinga Memorial Temple (ÈÑ≠ÊàêÂäüÁ•†) in Tainan, Taiwan, Tagawa Matsu's ancestral tablet is placed in a chamber called the Shrine of Queen Dowager Weng (ÁøÅÂ§™Â¶ÉÁ•†). The title \\"queen dowager\\" is a posthumous title based on the princeship/kingship of Koxinga (Prince-King of Yanping Prefecture) in the Southern Ming Empire. Tagawa's ancestral tablet was saved after the Qing attack. Tagawa Matsu's descendants through Koxinga live in both mainland China and Taiwan and her descendants through Shichizaemon live in Japan. Her descendants through her great-grandson Zheng Keshuang served as Han Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian in mainland China. They still live there to this day. Her descendants through her grandson Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan. Zheng Daoshun was the son of Shichizaemon and he adopted the Zheng surname. The \\"Asiatic Society of Japan\\" said \\"It was five years after the birth of Teiseiko (Koxinga) that his father (Zheng Zhilong) left for China and accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces. Soon after his departure, his wife gave birth to a second son who was named Shichizaemon\\" who spend his life wholly in Japan and did not develop the love for adventure and renown which made his elder brother so famous. \\" \\"The descendants of Shichizaemon served the Government for many years as interpreters of Chinese, and there reside to this day in Nagasaki certain Japanese who point with pride to their ancestor.\\" One of Tagawa's Chinese descendants, Zheng Xiaoxuan ÈÑ≠ÊõâÂµê the father of Zheng Chouyu, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu ÈÑ≠ÊÑÅ‰∫à was born in Shandong in mainland China in 1933 and called himself a \\"child of the resistance\\" against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese.

It is the capital of its eponymous region and district. √öst√≠ is situated in a mountainous district at the confluence of the B√≠lina and Elbe rivers. It is a major industrial center and, besides being an active river port, is an important railway junction. Name The name of √öst√≠ nad Labem is formed from the Old Czech ' (\\"river mouth\\") and ' (the River Elbe). It thus literally means \\"Mouth-upon-the-Elbe\\", in reference to its location at the Bilina's confluence with the Elbe. It is popularly known as √öst√≠ for short. The Czech name was Latinized as ' and Germanized as ' or '. Before Czechoslovak independence amid the dissolution of Austria-Hungary following the First World War, the town was usually known in English as Aussig, but sometimes also referred to as Aussyenad, Labem, or Oust√≠ nad Labem. History √öst√≠ nad Labem was mentioned as a trading centre as early as 993. In the second half of the 13th century, King of Bohemia invited German settlers into the country and granted them a German form of municipal incorporation, thereby founding the city proper. In 1423, as King of Bohemia, Sigismund pledged the town to Elector Frederick I of Mei√üen, who occupied it with a Saxon garrison. It was besieged by the Hussites in 1426: a German army of was sent to its relief but the besiegers defeated them amid great slaughter on 16 June; the next day, they stormed and razed the town. It was left derelict for three years before rebuilding began in 1429. √öst√≠ was again burned down in 1583 and was sacked by the Swedes in 1639 amid the Thirty Years' War. It also suffered grievously during the Seven Years' War and was near the 1813 Battle of Kulm between France and the alliance of Austria, Prussia, and Russia during the Napoleonic Wars. As late as 1830, its population was only 1400. As part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, it was eventually incorporated into Austria and heavily industrialized over the 19th century. After the Compromise of 1867, it headed the Aussig District, one of Austrian Bohemia's 94 District Commissions (').. In the 1870s, with only people, it was a major producer of woolen goods, linen, paper, ships, and chemicals and carried on a large trade in grain, fruit, mineral water, lumber, and coal. By 1900, large-scale immigration had boosted the population to nearly , mostly German, and added glassworking and stone to its trades. The local river port became the busiest in the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, surpassing even the seaport in Trieste. The factories of Aussig‚Äîas it was then known‚Äîwere an early center of the National Socialism (\\"Nazi\\") movement. The German Workers' Party in Austria (') was founded on 15 November 1903 and later gave rise to the Sudeten German Party and Austrian National Socialism. Their books continued to be printed in √öst√≠ even after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. During the 1930 census, √öst√≠ nad Labem was home to residents: considered German, Czech or Slovak, 222 Jews, 16 Russians, and 11 Hungarians. √öst√≠ was ceded to Nazi Germany with the rest of the Sudetenland in October 1938 under the terms of the Munich Agreement and placed under the administration of the Regierungsbezirk Aussig of Reichsgau Sudetenland. On New Year's Eve of that year, the Nazis burnt down the local synagogue; a meat factory was later raised in its place. The Jewish community in √öst√≠ nad Labem was mostly exterminated over the course of World War II amid the Holocaust. In April 1945, the city was severely bombed by the Allies. Under the terms of the Potsdam Conference and the Bene≈° decrees, the city was restored to Czechoslovakia and almost the totality of its previous population expelled as being German. In May 1948, the Communist government passed a new constitution declaring a people's republic. Communism continued until the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall set off a series of events which are now known as the Velvet Revolution. Today, √öst√≠ nad Labem is a major industrial city of the Czech Republic with substantial chemical, metallurgical, textile, food, and machine tool industries.

Since the latter were homes mainly to Romani, it turned into an international scandal. Mayor Ladislav Hru≈°ka promised local homeowners' representatives that the wall would be finished by the end of September, 1998. Foreign journalists travelled to √öst√≠ to investigate, and were told by councillors that the wall was not meant to segregate by race, but to keep respectable citizens safe from noise and rubbish coming from the opposite side of the street.Usti nad Labem / Maticni Street romove.radio.cz, 26-02-2000 In September, city representatives announced that plans would be changed from a four-metre soundproof wall to a 1.8-metre wall of ceramic bricks, and a children's playground would also be constructed in front of the tenement blocks. Despite these changes, the Roma Civic Initiative and Deputy Prime Minister Vladim√≠r ≈†pidla vocally opposed the construction.Hiding Gypsies behind a wall, BBC, February 26, 1999 The wall was criticised by U.S. Congressman Christopher Smith, and a delegation from the Council of Europe described it as a \\"racist\\" and drastic solution. The new plans slated construction to begin August 30, 1999, but a decision by the district office delayed the move because a wall that large would require a permit, and threatened to damage the root systems of trees along Matiƒçni Street. On October 5, however, construction began regardless of the opposition by foreign observers and members of the Czech government. The following day, 50 Roma physically blockaded construction of the wall and dismantled parts that had already been set up. Nonetheless, the wall was completed on October 13. Domestic and international pressure eventually persuaded the city to dismantle the wall, and it was demolished six weeks after it had been erected. The local zoo uses parts of this ceramic fence as a wall around its main entrance to this day. The original wall was only 1.8 metres high and a few more rows of ceramic parts were needed to make it higher. Matiƒçn√≠ Street is now uninhabited and its buildings are scheduled for demolition. Tourism The St≈ôekov castle is located in a southern suburb of the city. √öst√≠ is a centre for tourism owing to the romantic landscape of the Bohemian Highlands (ƒåesk√© st≈ôedoho≈ô√≠) and the ƒåesk√© ≈†v√Ωcarsko national park.

It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and east across the Palearctic to the Amur River, south to parts of North Africa where it is generally resident in any sort of woodland; most great tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the great tit and these have now been separated as two distinct species, the cinereous tit of southern Asia, and the Japanese tit of East Asia. The great tit remains the most widespread species in the genus Parus. The great tit is a distinctive bird with a black head and neck, prominent white cheeks, olive upperparts and yellow underparts, with some variation amongst the numerous subspecies. It is predominantly insectivorous in the summer, but will consume a wider range of food items in the winter months, including small hibernating bats. Like all tits it is a cavity nester, usually nesting in a hole in a tree. The female lays around 12 eggs and incubates them alone, although both parents raise the chicks. In most years the pair will raise two broods. The nests may be raided by woodpeckers, squirrels and weasels and infested with fleas, and adults may be hunted by sparrowhawks. The great tit has adapted well to human changes in the environment and is a common and familiar bird in urban parks and gardens. The great tit is also an important study species in ornithology. Taxonomy The great tit was described under its current binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Its scientific name is derived from the Latin parus \\"tit\\" and maior \\"larger\\". Francis Willughby had used the name in the 17th century. The 11 subspecies of the cinereous tit were once lumped with the great tit but recent genetic and bioacoustic studies now separate that group as a distinct species The great tit was formerly treated as ranging from Britain to Japan and south to the islands of Indonesia, with 36 described subspecies ascribed to four main species groups. The major group had 13 subspecies across Europe, temperate Asia and north Africa, the minor group's nine subspecies occurred from southeast Russia and Japan into northern southeast Asia and the 11 subspecies in the cinereus group were found from Iran across south Asia to Indonesia. The three bokharensis subspecies were often treated as a separate species, Parus bokharensis, the Turkestan tit. This form was once thought to form a ring species around the Tibetan Plateau, with gene flow throughout the subspecies, but this theory was abandoned when sequences of mitochondrial DNA were examined, finding that the four groups were distinct (monophyletic) and that the hybridisation zones between the groups were the result of secondary contact after a temporary period of isolation. A study published in 2005 confirmed that the major group was distinct from the cinereus and minor groups and that along with P. m. bokharensis it diverged from these two groups around 1.5 million years ago. The divergence between the bokharensis and major groups was estimated to have been about half a million years ago. The study also examined hybrids between representatives of the major and minor groups in the Amur Valley where the two meet. Hybrids were rare, suggesting that there were some reproductive barriers between the two groups. The study recommended that the two eastern groups be split out as new species, the cinereous tit (Parus cinereus), and the Japanese tit (Parus minor), but that the Turkestan tit be lumped in with the great tit. This taxonomy has been followed by some authorities, for example the IOC World Bird List. The Handbook of the Birds of the World volume treating the Parus species went for the more traditional classification, treating the Turkestan tit as a separate species but retaining the Japanese and cinereous tits with the great tit, a move that has not been without criticism. The nominate subspecies of the great tit is the most widespread, its range stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to the Amur Valley and from Scandinavia to the Middle East. The other subspecies have much more restricted distributions, four being restricted to islands and the remainder of the P. m. major subspecies representing former glacial refuge populations. The dominance of a single, morphologically uniform subspecies over such a large area suggests that the nominate race rapidly recolonised a large area after the last glacial epoch. This hypothesis is supported by genetic studies which suggest a geologically recent genetic bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion. The genus Parus once held most of the species of tit in the family Paridae, but morphological and genetic studies led to the splitting of that large genus in 1998. The great tit was retained in Parus, which along with Cyanistes comprises a lineage of tits known as the \\"non-hoarders\\", with reference to the hoarding behaviour of members of the other clade. The genus Parus is still the largest in the family, but may be split again. Other than those species formerly considered to be subspecies, the great tit's closest relatives are the white-naped and green-backed tits of southern Asia. Hybrids with tits outside the genus Parus are very rare, but have been recorded with blue tit, coal tit, and probably marsh tit. =Subspecies= There are currently 15 recognised subspecies of great tit: At alt= Great tit perched on twig. It has a wide black band down its breast and belly. *P. m. newtoni, described by Pra≈æ√°k in 1894, is found across the British Isles. *P. m. major, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is found throughout much of Europe, Asia Minor, northern and eastern Kazakhstan, southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, as far as the mid- Amur Valley. *P. m. excelsus, described by Buvry in 1857, is found in northwestern Africa. *P. m. corsus, described by Kleinschmidt in 1903, is found in Portugal, southern Spain, and Corsica. *P. m. mallorcae, described by von Jordans in 1913, is found in the Balearic Islands. *P. m. ecki, described by von Jordans in 1970, is found on Sardinia. *P. m. niethammeri, described by von Jordans in 1970, is found on Crete. *P. m. aphrodite, described by Madar√°sz in 1901, is found in southern Italy, southern Greece, Cyprus and the Aegean Islands. *P. m. terrasanctae was described by Hartert in 1910. It is found in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria. *P. m. karelini, described by Zarudny in 1910, is found in southeastern Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. *P. m. blandfordi was described by Pra≈æ√°k in 1894. It is found in north central and southwestern Iran. *P. m. bokharensis was described by Lichtenstein in 1823. It is found in southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and far north of Iran and Afghanistan. It was, along with following two subspecies, once treated as separate species. *P. m. turkestanicus, was described by Zarudny & Loudon in 1905, and ranges from east Kazakhstan to extreme north west China and west Mongolia. *P. m. ferghanensis, was described by Buturlin in 1912, and is found in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. *P. m. kapustini, was described by Portenko in 1954, and is found in north west China (north west Xinjiang) to Mongolia and Siberia.Avibase. The world bird database. thumb Description alt= duller-plumaged great tit with weak breast and belly stripe The great tit is large for a tit at in length, and has a distinctive appearance that makes it easy to recognise. The nominate race P. major major has a bluish-black crown, black neck, throat, bib and head, and white cheeks and ear coverts. The breast is bright lemon-yellow and there is a broad black mid-line stripe running from the bib to vent. There is a dull white spot on the neck turning to greenish yellow on the upper nape. The rest of the nape and back are green tinged with olive. The wing-coverts are green, the rest of the wing is bluish-grey with a white wing-bar. The tail is bluish grey with white outer tips. The plumage of the female is similar to that of the male except that the colours are overall duller; the bib is less intensely black, as is the line running down the belly, which is also narrower and sometimes broken. Young birds are like the female, except that they have dull olive-brown napes and necks, greyish rumps, and greyer tails, with less defined white tips. alt= Great tit with strongly yellow sides perched on twig There is some variation in the subspecies. P. m. newtoni is like the nominate race but has a slightly longer bill, the mantle is slightly deeper green, there is less white on the tail tips, and the ventral mid-line stripe is broader on the belly. P. m. corsus also resembles the nominate form but has duller upperparts, less white in the tail and less yellow in the nape. P. m. mallorcae is like the nominate subspecies, but has a larger bill, greyer-blue upperparts and slightly paler underparts. P. m. ecki is like P. m. mallorcae except with bluer upperparts and paler underparts. P. m. excelsus is similar to the nominate race but has much brighter green upperparts, bright yellow underparts and no (or very little) white on the tail. P. m. aphrodite has darker, more olive-grey upperparts, and the underparts are more yellow to pale cream. P. m. niethammeri is similar to P. m. aphrodite but the upperparts are duller and less green, and the underparts are pale yellow. P. m. terrasanctae resembles the previous two subspecies but has slightly paler upperparts. P. m. blandfordi is like the nominate but with a greyer mantle and scapulars and pale yellow underparts, and P. m. karelini is intermediate between the nominate and P. m. blandfordi, and lacks white on the tail. The plumage of P. m. bokharensis is much greyer, pale creamy white to washed out grey underparts, a larger white cheep patch, a grey tail, wings, back and nape. It is also slightly smaller, with a smaller bill but longer tail. The situation is similar for the two related subspecies in the Turkestan tit group. P. m. turkestanicus is like P. m. bokharensis but with a larger bill and darker upperparts. P. m. ferghanensis is like P. m. bokharensis but with a smaller bill, darker grey on the flanks and a more yellow wash on the juvenile birds. A pair of great tits; the one on the left is female, the second one is male.The colour of the male bird's breast has been shown to correlate with stronger sperm, and is one way that the male demonstrates his reproductive superiority to females. Higher levels of carotenoid increase the intensity of the yellow of the breast its colour, and also enable the sperm to better withstand the onslaught of free radicals. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by the bird and have to be obtained from food, so a bright colour in a male demonstrates his ability to obtain good nutrition. However, the saturation of the yellow colour is also influenced by environmental factors, such as weather conditions. The width of the male's ventral stripe, which varies with individual, is selected for by females, with higher quality females apparently selecting males with wider stripes. =Voice= Great tit : song Another song type Great tit : sonagram Great tit twittering The great tit is, like other tits, a vocal bird, and has up to 40 types of calls and songs. The calls are generally the same between the sexes, but the male is much more vocal and the female rarely calls. Soft single notes such as \\"pit\\", \\"spick\\", or \\"chit\\" are used as contact calls. A loud \\"tink\\" is used by adult males as an alarm or in territorial disputes. One of the most familiar is a \\"teacher, teacher\\", often likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel, which is used in proclaiming ownership of a territory. In former times, English folk considered the \\"saw-sharpening\\" call to be a foretelling of rain. There is little geographic variation in calls, but tits from the two south Asian groups recently split from the great tit do not recognise or react to the calls of the temperate great tits. One explanation for the great tit's wide repertoire is the Beau Geste hypothesis. The eponymous hero of the novel propped dead soldiers against the battlements to give the impression that his fort was better defended than was really the case. Similarly, the multiplicity of calls gives the impression that the tit's territory is more densely occupied than it actually is. Whether the theory is correct or not, those birds with large vocabularies are socially dominant and breed more successfully. Distribution, movements and habitat Mixed-forests are one of the habitats great tits use in Europe At nest box in Altenbeken, Germany The great tit has a wide distribution across much of Eurasia. It can be found across all of Europe except for Iceland and northern Scandinavia, including numerous Mediterranean islands. In North Africa it lives in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It also occurs across the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia from northern Iran and Afghanistan to Mongolia, as well as across northern Asia from the Urals as far east as northern China and the Amur Valley. The great tit occupies a range of habitats. It is most commonly found in open deciduous woodland, mixed forests, forest edges and gardens. In dense forests, including conifer forests it prefers forest clearings. In northern Siberia it lives in boreal taiga. In North Africa it rather resides in oak forests as well as stands of Atlas cedar and even palm groves. In the east of its range in Siberia, Mongolia and China it favours riverine willow and birch forest. Riverine woodlands of willows, poplars are among the habitats of the Turkestan subspecies, as well as low scrubland, oases; at higher altitudes it occupies habitats ranging from dense deciduous and coniferous forests to open areas with scattered trees. The great tit is generally not migratory. Pairs will usually remain near or in their territory year round, even in the northern parts of their range. Young birds will disperse from their parents' territory, but usually not far. Populations may become irruptive in poor or harsh winters, meaning that groups of up to a thousand birds may unpredictably move from northern Europe to the Baltic and also to Netherlands, Britain, even as far as the southern Balkans. The great tit was unsuccessfully introduced into the United States; birds were set free near Cincinnati, Ohio between 1872 and 1874 but failed to become established. Suggestions that they were an excellent control measure for codling moths nearly led to their introduction to some new areas particularly in the United States of America, however this plan was not implemented. Birds were later introduced to the Almaty Province in what is now Kazakhstan in 1960‚Äì61 and became established, although their present status is unclear. Behaviour =Diet and feeding= alt= Male great tit on branch with sunflower seed Great tits are primarily insectivorous in the summer, feeding on insects and spiders which they capture by foliage gleaning. Their larger invertebrate prey include cockroaches, grasshoppers and crickets, lacewings, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera), ants, flies (Diptera), caddis flies, beetles, scorpion flies, harvestmen, bees and wasps, snails and woodlice. During the breeding season, the tits prefer to feed protein-rich caterpillars to their young. A study published in 2007 found that great tits helped to reduce caterpillar damage in apple orchards by as much as 50%. Nestlings also undergo a period in their early development where they are fed a number of spiders, possibly for nutritional reasons. In autumn and winter, when insect prey becomes scarcer, great tits add berries and seeds to their diet. Seeds and fruit usually come from deciduous trees and shrubs, like for instance the seeds of beech and hazel. Where it is available they will readily take table scraps, peanuts and sunflower seeds from bird tables. In particularly severe winters they may consume 44% of their body weight in sunflower seeds. They often forage on the ground, particularly in years with high beech mast production. Great tits, along with other tits, will join winter mixed-species foraging flocks. Great tit feeding its young with an insect Large food items, such as large seeds or prey, are dealt with by \\"hold- hammering\\", where the item is held with one or both feet and then struck with the bill until it is ready to eat. Using this method, a great tit can get into a hazelnut in about twenty minutes. When feeding young, adults will hammer off the heads off large insects to make them easier to consume, and remove the gut from caterpillars so that the tannins in the gut will not retard the chick's growth. Great tits combine dietary versatility with a considerable amount of intelligence and the ability to solve problems with insight learning, that is to solve a problem through insight rather than trial and error. In England, great tits learned to break the foil caps of milk bottles delivered at the doorstep of homes to obtain the cream at the top. This behaviour, first noted in 1921, spread rapidly in the next two decades. In 2009, great tits were reported killing, and eating the brains of roosting pipistrelle bats. This is the first time a songbird has been recorded preying on bats. The tits only do this during winter when the bats are hibernating and other food is scarce. They have also been recorded using tools, using a conifer needle in the bill to extract larvae from a hole in a tree. =Breeding= Great tits are monogamous breeders and establish breeding territories. These territories are established in late January and defence begins in late winter or early spring. Territories are usually reoccupied in successive years, even if one of the pair dies, so long as the brood is raised successfully. Females are likely to disperse to new territories if their nest is predated the previous year. If the pair divorces for some reason then the birds will disperse, with females travelling further than males to establish new territories. Although the great tit is socially monogamous, extra-pair copulations are frequent. One study in Germany found that 40% of nests contained some offspring fathered by parents other than the breeding male and that 8.5% of all chicks were the result of cuckoldry. Adult males tend to have a higher reproductive success compared to sub-adults. Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden alt= nest with seven chicks. These are covered with grey down, and have bright yellow gapes Great tits are seasonal breeders. The exact timing of breeding varies by a number of factors, most importantly location. Most breeding occurs between January and September; in Europe the breeding season usually begins after March. In Israel there are exceptional records of breeding during the months of October to December. The amount of sunlight and daytime temperatures will also affect breeding timing. One study found a strong correlation between the timing of laying and the peak abundance of caterpillar prey, which is in turn correlated to temperature. On an individual level, younger females tend to start laying later than older females. alt= Great tit leaving its wooden nest box Great tit nesting in nest box Great tits are cavity nesters, breeding in a hole that is usually inside a tree, although occasionally in a wall or rock face, and they will readily take to nest boxes. The nest inside the cavity is built by the female, and is made of plant fibres, grasses, moss, hair, wool and feathers. The number in the clutch is often very large, as many as 18, but five to twelve is more common. Clutch size is smaller when birds start laying later, and is also lower when the density of competitors is higher. Second broods tend to have smaller clutches. Insularity also affects clutch size, with great tits on offshore islands laying smaller clutches with larger eggs than mainland birds. The eggs are white with red spots. The female undertakes all incubation duties, and is fed by the male during incubation. The bird is a close sitter, hissing when disturbed. The timing of hatching, which is best synchronised with peak availability of prey, can be manipulated when environmental conditions change after the laying of the first egg by delaying the beginning of incubation, laying more eggs or pausing during incubation. The incubation period is between 12 and 15 days. alt= Young bird with ruffled adult-like plumage and yellow gape The chicks, like those of all tits, are hatched unfeathered and blind. Once feathers begin to erupt, the nestlings are unusual for altricial birds in having plumage coloured with carotenoids similar to their parents (in most species it is dun-coloured to avoid predation). The nape is yellow and attracts the attention of the parents by its ultraviolet reflectance. This may be to make them easier to find in low light, or be a signal of fitness to win the parents' attention. This patch turns white after the first moult at age two months, and diminishes in size as the bird grows. Chicks are fed by both parents, usually receiving of food a day. Both parents provision the chicks with food and aid in nest sanitation by removing faecal packets, with no difference in the feeding effort between the sexes. The nestling period is between 16 and 22 days, with chicks being independent of the parents eight days after fledging. Feeding of the fledgeling may continue after independence, lasting up to 25 days in chicks from the first brood, but as long as 50 days in the second brood. Nestlings from second broods have weaker immune systems and body condition than those from first broods, and hence have a lower juvenile survival rate. Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. The reduced fitness is generally considered to be a consequence of the increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles in these offspring. In natural populations of P. major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative. =Ecology= The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of great tits, with the young from second broods being at higher risk partly because of the hawk's greater need for food for its own developing young. The nests of great tits are raided by great spotted woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes. Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well. A species of biting louse (Mallophaga) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe. The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits. It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host. This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle Gnathoncus punctulatus, The rove beetle Microglotta pulla also feeds on fleas and their larvae. Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests, they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds, tits being the preferred hosts. Great tits compete with pied flycatchers for nesting boxes, and can kill prospecting flycatcher males. Incidences of fatal competition are more frequent when nesting times overlap, and climate change has led to greater synchrony of nesting between the two species and flycatcher deaths. Having killed the flycatchers, the great tits may consume their brains. Relationship with humans alt= adult great tit perched on hand The great tit is a popular garden bird due to its acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or seed. Its willingness to move into nest boxes has made it a valuable study subject in ornithology; it has been particularly useful as a model for the study of the evolution of various life-history traits, particularly clutch size. A study of a literature database search found 1,349 articles relating to Parus major for the period between 1969 and 2002. The great tit has generally adjusted to human modifications of the environment. It is more common and has better breeding success in areas with undisturbed forest cover, but it has adapted to human modified habitats. It can be very common in urban areas. For example, the breeding population in the city of Sheffield (a city of half a million people) has been estimated at some 17,000 individuals. In adapting to human environments its song has been observed to change in noise-polluted urban environments. In areas with low frequency background noise pollution, the song has a higher frequency than in quieter areas. This tit has expanded its range, moving northwards into Scandinavia and Scotland, and south into Israel and Egypt. The total population is estimated at between 300‚Äì1,100 million birds in a range of 32.4 million km2 (12.5 million sq mi). While there have been some localised declines in population in areas with poorer quality habitats, its large range and high numbers mean that the great tit is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The battle was fought near the town of Hexham in Northumberland. John Neville, later to be 1st Marquess of Montagu, led a modest force of 3,000-4,000 men, and routed the rebel Lancastrians. Most of the rebel leaders were captured and executed, including Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Lord Hungerford. Henry VI, however, was kept safely away (having been captured in battle three times earlier), and escaped to the north. With their leadership gone, only a few castles remained in rebel hands. After these fell later in the year, Edward IV was not seriously challenged until the Earl of Warwick changed his allegiance from the Yorkist to the Lancastrian cause in 1469. Background After the Battle of Hedgeley Moor, the Lancastrians failed to prevent the Yorkists from concluding peace negotiations with Scotland in 1463, and soon found that their northern base of operations was now threatened. It was decided to mount a campaign in the north of England to gather Lancastrian support before a huge force under Edward IV could muster in Leicester and move north to crush the rebellion. The Lancastrian army moved through Northumberland in late April 1464 under the Duke of Somerset, and gathered support from Lancastrian garrisons until it camped near to Hexham in early May. A Yorkist force under John Neville raced north as vanguard of Edward's larger force, and the two sides met outside Hexham on 14 May 1464. The battle Plan of the battle of Hexham Details of the site of the battle, the composition and number of combatants and the events are sketchy but it is thought that the battle was relatively bloodless. The Lancastrian camp was near Linnels Bridge over the Devil's Water found slightly to the south of Hexham. The Yorkists crossed onto the south bank of the Tyne on the night of 12‚Äì13 May and were, by the morning of the 14th, in a position to attack Hexham. Presumably the Yorkist advance was at speed, as despite warnings by their own scouts the Lancastrians had little time to prepare for battle. It is thought that Somerset rushed his forces to a site near Linnels Bridge and deployed his troops in three detachments in a meadow near the Devil's Water, there he hoped he could engage the Yorkist army before it moved past him into Hexham. No sooner had the Lancastrians taken their positions than the Yorkists charged down from their positions on higher ground. Upon seeing the Yorkist advance the right detachment of the Lancastrian army, commanded by Lord Roos, turned and fled across the Devil's Water and into Hexham, before a single blow had been struck. The remnants of Somerset's force were in a hopeless situation, hemmed in and unable to manoeuvre; the Yorkist troops charged through the one opening at the east end of Linnel's Meadow and engaged the bewildered Lancastrian soldiers. Lancastrian morale collapsed, and after some token resistance the remains of Somerset's army was pushed into the Devil's Water by the Yorkist infantry. A chaotic rout followed, men either drowned in the river or were crushed as they tried to climb the steep banks of the Devil's Water in the retreat towards Hexham. Most, however, were trapped in West Dipton Wood on the north bank of the river and were forced to surrender when the Yorkists approached. The aftermath Neville showed little of Edward's conciliatory spirit, and had thirty leading Lancastrians executed in Hexham on the evening following the battle, including Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, and Lord Roos. Sir William Tailboys was captured and executed shortly after he tried to flee north with ¬£2,000 of Henry's war chest. Upon the loss of its leadership and bankroll, the Lancastrian resistance in the North of England collapsed. Following his defeat in the Battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464, Henry found refuge, sheltered by Lancastrian supporters, at houses across the north of England. Following stays at Muncaster Castle on the Cumbrian coast and at nearby Bolton Hall, he was in hiding at Waddington Hall, in Waddington, Lancashire, the home of Sir Richard Tempest. Here, he was betrayed by \\"a black monk of Addington\\" and on 13 July 1465, a group of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the home to arrest him. Henry fled into nearby woods but was soon captured.https://books.google.ca/books?id=5OI6BAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT195&lpg;=PT195&dq;=waddington++Richard+Tempest,++henry+vi++fugitive&source;=bl&ots;=4QNjaWXaS9&sig;=ACfU3U3baNJ0hY8a-ZZW0AjA3S1v_brQbA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjd9pap6aXkAhVxn- AKHcIDCXsQ6AEwBXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q;=waddington%20%20Richard%20Tempest%2C%20%20henry%20vi%20%20fugitive&f;=false, The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudorshttps://books.google.ca/books?id=rnWMjn2iCt0C&pg;=PA333&lpg;=PA333&dq;=King+henry+vi++refuge+short+time+at+Waddington&source;=bl&ots;=56aEGQpl72&sig;=ACfU3U2uZeYYWyJWAaZ4BXS99o_lJd_abw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiCksvN7KXkAhXHmuAKHQcwDGEQ6AEwGXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q;=King%20henry%20vi%20%20refuge%20short%20time%20at%20Waddington&f;=false, The Wars of the Roses, page 333 This meant that the rebellion was effectively over.

A good portion of the work is viewed in animation festivals and private screen rooms along with schools that produce animation through instruction. The significance of independent animation is as important as studio fare.  History  = Early independent animation = The history of animation is as old as the film industry itself. Independent animators have produced innovative, often experimental, shorts since the silent era. One of the earliest feature-length animated films was The Adventures of Prince Achmed, made in 1926 by Lotte Reiniger, a German artist who made silhouette animation using intricate cut- out figures and back-lighting. She made another feature, Dr. Dolittle, in 1928.\\"Lotte Reiniger\\", William Moritz, Animation World Magazine, Issue 1.3 In America, working independent animators included Mary Ellen Bute, John Whitney and Oskar Fischinger alongside earlier efforts of what would become UPA. 1959 saw the first independent animated film to win an Oscar with John Hubley's Moonbird which was also produced by wife and collaborator Faith Hubley using limited animation to tell their own personal stories. Jordan Belson, Robert Breer and Stan Vanderbeek made experimental animation during this time. = The United States =  Success of independent animation  Ralph Bakshi tried to establish an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions in the 1970s. In the late 1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz founded Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Fritz the Cat was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with Heavy Traffic. Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back. Other independent animators during this time included Charles Braverman, Gene Deitch, Marv Newland, Fred Wolf and Will Vinton. The latter two would go on to win Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film along with the works of the Hubleys and Ernest Pintoff starting in the late 1950s-early 1960s. Notable award-winning films included Dale Case and Bob Mitchell's The Further Adventures of Uncle Sam, Ted Petok's The Crunch Bird, Frank Mouris's Frank Film and Jimmy Picker's Sundae in New York. Animation historians John Canemaker and Michael Sporn also made independent animation in New York, both earning Oscar nods for their work (only Canemaker won in 2005). Other animators like Jeff Scher, Joanna Priestley, Kathy Rose, Robert Swarthe, Vince Collins, Barrie Nelson, Eli Noyes, Sky David (aka Dennis Pies), Steve Segal, Adam Beckett and George Griffin also made experimental animation during the mid- to late 1970s through the early- to mid-1980s. In the 1970s, independent animators like Sally Cruikshank continued to explore independent and D.I.Y. distribution options, but were still largely met with rejection even though their work is now considered ground breaking. Collections of independent films have been gathered for theatrical viewing, and video release, under such titles as the International Tournee of Animation (which existed between about 1966 and the late 1990s), Spike and Mike's Classic Festival of Animation (1977 to 1990) and Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation since 1990. Contemporary independent animators, including Steven Subotnick, Paul Fierlinger, Bill Plympton,Independent Animation episode 4 - Indie Animated Features Don Hertzfeldt, Nina Paley,Independent Animation episode 4 - Indie Animated Features Suzan Pitt and PES have also made work outside of the studio system.  Later independent animation  The rise of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential increase in the production of independent animation which included personal independent works by Timothy Hittle, Lewis Klahr and John Schnall. Personal computer power increased to the point where it was possible for a single person to produce an animated cartoon on a home computer, using software such as Flash, and distribute these short films over the World Wide Web. Independently produced Internet cartoons flourished as the popularity of the Web grew, and a number of strange, often hilarious short cartoons were produced for the Web. In the late 1990s, an independent animated short film called The Spirit of Christmas was produced for under $2,000 by two artists, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This film was widely distributed on the Internet as a pirated cartoon, and its phenomenal popularity gave rise to the popular television animated series South Park. Limited 1990s bandwidth made streaming difficult, if not impossible. While some animators like Sp√ºmc√∏'s John K. opted to use Flash, it still required a plug-in making it unviewable in many early web browsers. Other early online animators like M. Wartella opted to use the Animated GIF to overcome these limitations and create early web-based animation viewable through all browsers. Continued success for independent animation occurred in the 2000s with animated shorts such as Making Fiends. Both shorts garnered enough support to be turned into full-length TV Series, airing on Nicktoons Network and Big TV, respectively. By the late mid-2000s, YouTube and the Internet and like-minded online video distribution, in addition to independent broadcasting sites that followed, proved to be a dominant form of independently distributed, broadcast, edited, and produced animation TV shows, anime, feature films, music videos, retro animation, commercials, trailers, original online animation content, and web exclusives (which would otherwise not stand a chance of seeing airtime on more normal, seemingly infinitely more expensive forms of mainstream broadcasting on traditional television networks, which still continue to function on a more conservative and old fashioned distribution matrix). The Annoying Orange, which started off as a series of viral quasi-CGI animated comedy shorts on YouTube, quickly gained a cult following and an excess of 100 million views online. It is an example of an animated web-series to transition between Internet and television distribution successfully, as an animated series on Cartoon Network. Independent animation outside the United States = Canada = Norman McLaren working on a frame of animation. The National Film Board of Canada began production of animation when Norman McLaren joined the organization in 1941. The NFB proved to be an organization that would give Canada a presence in the film world. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized experimental filmmaker. The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as pinscreen animation, but most of the Oscars and many other awards it won were done in traditional cel animation (with the exceptions of The Sand Castle and Ryan). McLaren's Oscar-winning Neighbours popularized the form of character movement referred to as pixillation, a variant of stop motion. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name. Animators including Janet Perlman, Richard Condie, Cordell Barker, John Weldon, Caroline Leaf, Ishu Patel and others all worked at NFB. = The United Kingdom = The BFI funded around thirty pieces of experimental animation between the mid-fifties to mid-nineties (notable examples: The Quay Brothers). Another major contributor to independent animation in Britain was Channel 4, which gained an international reputation as one of the most adventurous broadcasters of animation featuring works from Joanna Quinn (Girls' Night Out), Paul Barry (The Sandman), Mark Baker (The Village) and former NFB animator Paul Driessen (3 Misses).

Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, it was destroyed by the Huns in the 4th century AD. Theodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the sphere of influence of the Khazars (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the Byzantine Empire. Like the rest of Crimea, this place (village) fell under the domination of the Kipchaks and was conquered by the Mongols in the 1230s. =Kaffa= Satellite image. The Genoese ports and later Turkish-controlled area were south of the mountains. In the late 13th century, traders from the Republic of Genoa arrived and purchased the city from the ruling Golden Horde.Khvalkov, I.E., The Colonies of Genoa in the Black Sea Region: Evolution and Transformation,European University Institute, Department of History and Civilization,Florence, 8 September 2015 They established a flourishing trading settlement called Kaffa, which virtually monopolized trade in the Black Sea region and served as a major port and administrative center for the Genoese settlements around the Sea. It came to house one of Europe's biggest slave markets. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia also adds that the city of Caffa was established during the times when the area was ruled by the Khan of the Golden Horde Mengu-Timur.Mengu-Timur (–ú–µ–Ω–≥—É-–¢–∏–º—É—Ä). Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Ibn Battuta visited the city, noting it was a \\"great city along the sea coast inhabited by Christians, most of them Genoese.\\" He further stated, \\"We went down to its port, where we saw a wonderful harbor with about two hundred vessels in it, both ships of war and trading vessels, small and large, for it is one of the world's celebrated ports.\\" In early 1318 Pope John XXII established a Latin Church diocese of Kaffa, as a suffragan of Genoa. The papal bull of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: \\"a villa de Varna in Bulgaria usque Sarey inclusive in longitudinem et a mari Pontico usque ad terram Ruthenorum in latitudinem\\" (\\"from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude\\"). The first bishop was Fra' Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop ad partes Tartarorum. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the Ottomans in 1475.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 432Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1, pp. 154‚Äì155; vol. 2, pp. XVIII e 117; vol. 3, p. 145; vol. 5, p. 134Gasparo Luigi Oderico, Lettere ligustiche ossia Osservazioni critiche sullo stato geografico della Liguria fino ai Tempi di Ottone il Grande, con le Memorie storiche di Caffa ed altri luoghi della Crimea posseduti un tempo da' Genovesi, Bassano 1792 (especially p. 166 ff.) Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 855 It is believed that the devastating pandemic of the Black Death entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under Janibeg was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of biological warfare. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach Europe from Crimea. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under Mongol control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well. Kaffa eventually recovered. The thriving, culturally diverse city and its thronged slave market have been described by the Spanish traveler Pedro Tafur, who was there in the 1430s.Tafur, Andan√ßas e viajes In 1462 Caffa placed itself under the protection of King Casimir IV of Poland.D.

He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black sea. In 1473, the tudun (or governor) of the Crimean Khanate died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute. Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander Gedik Ahmet Pasha, which left Constantinople 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan's palace. On 8 July the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (Kefeli Mahalle) which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 343ff. Renamed Kefe, Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea. In 1615 Zaporozhian Cossacks under the leadership of Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa. Having conquered the city, the cossacks released the men, women and children who were slaves. =Feodosia again= Ottoman control ceased when the expanding Russian Empire took over Crimea between 1774 and 1783. It was renamed Feodosiya (—≤–µ–æ–¥–æ—Å—ñ—è, reformed spelling: –§–µ–æ–¥–æ—Å–∏—è), after the traditional Russian reading of the ancient Greek name. In 1900 Zibold constructed the first air well (dew condenser) on mount Tepe-Oba near Feodosiya. Feodosia, painting by Carlo Bossoli, 1856 The city was occupied by the forces of Nazi Germany during World War II, sustaining significant damage in the process. The Jewish population numbering 3,248 before the German occupation was murdered by SD-Einsatzgruppe D between November 16 and December 15, 1941.Martin Gilbert, The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust, 2002, pp.64, 83 A witness interviewed by Yahad-In Unum described how the Jews were rounded-up in the city: \\"Posters announced that the Jews had to go to jail with food reserves for three days because they will be taken to Israel.\\" A monument commemorating the Holocaust victims is situated at the crossroads of Kerchensky and Symferopolsky highways. On Passover eve, April 7, 2012, unknown persons desecrated, for the sixth time, the monument, allegedly as an anti-Semitic act. All native Tatar inhabitants were arrested by Russian forces as several thousand Tatars had fought side-by-side with the Nazis against Soviet forces and had participated in the Jewish genocide. Following Stalin orders, all Tatars were sent to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian republics of the USSR. Geography =Climate= The climate is warm and dry and could be described as humid subtropical, but not as Mediterranean, because the drying summer trend is not pronounced enough. Modern Feodosiya Feodosia embankment. View from Tepe-Oba over Ordzhonikidze (Urban-type settlement under the town's jurisdiction) Modern Feodosiya is a resort city with a population of about 69,000 people. It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically Russian; the Ukrainian language is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosiya made the news with the 2006 anti-NATO port riot. While most beaches in Crimea are made of pebbles, there is a unique Golden Beach (Zolotoy Plyazh) made of small seashells in the Feodosiya area. The Golden Beach stretches for 15 km. The city is sparsely populated during the winter months. Most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. Like in the other resort towns in Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the C.I.S. countries of the former Soviet Union. Feodosiya was the city where the seascape painter Ivan Aivazovsky lived and worked all his life, and where general Pyotr Kotlyarevsky and the writer Alexander Grin spent their declining years. Popular tourist locations include the Aivazovsky National Art Gallery and the Genoese fortress.

It is native throughout mainland Europe east to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains, and the British Isles which determine its western boundary. The northernmost location is in the Trondheimsfjord region of Norway.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe.

The bark is smooth and pale grey on young trees, becoming thick and vertically fissured on old trees. The shoots are stout, greenish-grey, with jet-black buds (which distinguish it from most other ash species, which have grey or brown buds). The leaves are opposite, long, pinnately compound, with 7‚Äì13 leaflets with coarsely serrated margins, elliptic to narrowly elliptic, long and broad and sessile on the leaf rachis. There are no stipules. These features distinguish ash from mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) in which the leaves are alternate with paired stipules. The leaves are often among the last to open in spring, and the first to fall in autumn if an early frost strikes; they often fall dull green or develop a bright yellow autumn colour. The flowers are borne in short panicles, open before the leaves, and have no perianth. The female flowers are somewhat longer than the male flowers, dark purple, without petals, and are wind-pollinated. Both male and female flowers can occur on the same tree, but it is more common to find all male and all female trees. A tree that is all male one year can produce female flowers the next, and similarly a female tree can become male. The fruit is a samara long and broad, often hanging in bunches through the winter;Kilbracken, J.1983. Larousse Easy way guide Trees. Larousse. they are often called 'ash keys'.Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Mitchell, A. F. (1982). The Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins If the fruit is gathered and planted when it is still green and not fully ripe, it will germinate straight away, however once the fruit is brown and fully ripe, it will not germinate until 18 months after sowing (i.e. not until two winters have passed).Forestry Commission/ Edlin, H. L. Broadleaves, HMSO, 1985, p36 European ash rarely exceeds 250 years of age. However, there are numerous specimens estimated between 200 and 250 years old and there are a few over 250. The largest is in Clapton Court, England and is in girth. There are several examples over in Derbyshire alone. Distribution Fraxinus excelsior is native to Europe from northern Spain to Russia, and from southern Fennoscandia to northern Greece. It is also considered native in southwestern Asia from northern Turkey east to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains. The northernmost location is in the Trondheimsfjord region of Norway. The species is widely cultivated and reportedly naturalized in New Zealand and in scattered locales in the United States and Canada including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and British Columbia. It is native throughout the British Isles, particularly on limestone, as in northern Scotland, where the most northerly native ashwood in the British Isles occurs on limestone at Rassal Ashwood. It is widely planted elsewhere. Ecology Ash occurs on a wide range of soil types, but is particularly associated with basic soils on calcareous substrates. The most northerly ashwood in Britain is on limestone at Rassal, Wester Ross, latitude 57.4278 N. Ash prefers moister soil types and is commonly limited by temperature and so not found at the higher colder altitudes in much of Europe, though in Iran, it may reach 2000 m asl. As a young seedling, it is shade tolerant, but older trees are light-demanding. It is an early-succession species and may well outcompete beech and oak, which are later-succession species.A review of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.): implications for silviculture Forestry, Dorota Dobrowolska1,*, Sebastian Hein, Anne Oosterbaan, Sven Wagner, Jo Clark and Jens Peter Skovsgaard (2011) doi: 10.1093/forestry/cpr001, 2011 F. excelsior mycorrhizae are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex. Unlike other Fraxinus species, F. excelsior does not form ectomycorrhizae. The Biological Records Centre of the UK records 111 species of insects and mites using ash as a food plant, of which 29 are specific to ash. A further six are specific to ash and its Oleaceae relative wild privet (Ligustrum vulgare). A number of Lepidoptera species use the species as a food source. One example of an ash-specific feeding moth is the centre-barred sallow (Atethmia centrago). The larvae burrow into the buds when newly hatched and later feed on the flowers and leaves. A common moth which causes the browning of ash leaves, as well as garden privet and lilac, is Gracillaria syringella. The usually gregarious larvae form an epidermal gallery (i.e. feed within the leaf) which leads to a brown blotch with black frass. Later, two successive cones are formed by folding the tip of a leaf downwards. In Britain, 14 galls have been recorded on ash. The British Plant Gall Society defines a gall as \\"... an abnormal growth produced by a plant under the influence of another organism\\". =Ash dieback= Ash dieback is caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus which was previously known as Chalara fraxinea. Research into the genetics of the resistance of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) has shown that resistance does occur in European populations, but at least for the samples tested, it is neither common nor strong. Genome The genome of Fraxinus excelsior is being sequenced by two groups of scientists in the United Kingdom. A group at Queen Mary University of London led by Richard Buggs are sequencing the self-pollinated offspring of a tree from Worcestershire, held by the Earth Trust. A group at the John Innes Centre and The Genome Analysis Centre led by Allan Downie are sequencing \\"Tree 35\\" from Denmark, discovered by Erik Kj√¶r, which has survived 8 years of ash dieback. Uses Veneer of common ash wood Replica of the body frame from the Volvo √ñV 4 car, made primarily from ash wood The resilience and rapid growth made it an important resource for smallholders and farmers. It was probably the most versatile wood in the countryside with wide-ranging uses. Until World War II, the trees were often coppiced on a 10-year cycle to provide a sustainable source of timber for fuel and poles for building and woodworking.Mabey, R. (1996). Flora Britannica. Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd . The colour of the wood ranges from creamy white to light brown, and the heart wood may be a darker olive-brown. Ash timber is hard, tough and very hard-wearing, with a coarse, open grain and a density of 710 kg/m3.Ash. Niche Timbers. Accessed 19-08-2009. It lacks oak's natural resistance to decay, and is not as suitable for posts buried in the ground. Because of its high flexibility, shock resistance, and resistance to splitting, ash wood is the traditional material for bows, tool handles, especially for hammers and axes, tennis rackets, and snooker cue sticks, and it was extensively used in the construction of early aircraft. Ash was commonly used green for making chair frames which would be seated with another timber or with woven rush (e.g. those made by Philip Clissett, see also The English Regional Chair). The parts were turned on a pole lathe or shaped with a drawknife. The practice essentially died out in the early 20th century, but has seen a revival in recent years. Ash is an important constituent of wood pasture, a European management system in which open woodland provided shelter and forage for grazing animals. Ash was coppiced and pollarded, often in hedgerows, and evidence in the form of some huge boles with multiple trunks emerging at head height can still be seen in parts of Britain. The Glen Lyon ash is a notable example of a pollarded ash which at about 400‚Äì500 years of age achieved a girth of 6 m. In Northumberland, crab and lobster pots (traps) sometimes known as 'creeves' by local people are still made from ash sticks. Because of its elasticity European ash wood was commonly used for walking sticks. Poles were cut from a coppice and the ends heated in steam. The wood could then be bent in a curved vise to form the handle of the walking stick. The light colour and attractive grain of ash wood make it popular in modern furniture such as chairs, dining tables, doors, and other architectural features and wood flooring. Ash is the only wood used for the manufacture of hurleys, referred to as hurls in parts of Leinster and known as a cam√°n in Irish, the timber sticks used in the game of hurling in Ireland. Hurleys are manufactured from the butt log (bottom 1.5-m of the stem) and from trees ideally of a diameter at breast height around 25‚Äì30 cm. Only fast-grown, straight, and knot-free ash can be used for this purpose. Due to the lack of available ash in Ireland, over 75% of the timber needed to produce the 350,000 hurleys required for the game annually must be imported, mostly from Eastern European countries. The importance of ash timber to the game of hurling is reflected in the fact that the game is referred to all over Ireland as \\"The Clash of the Ash\\". Ash is valuable as firewood because it burns well even when 'green' (freshly cut). Ash bark and leaves are used in modern herbal medicine for its astringent and laxative properties. Mythology In the 13th-century Edda and other writing relating to Norse mythology, the vast ash tree Yggdrasil (\\"the steed (gallows) of Odin\\"), watered by three magical springs, serves as axis mundi, sustaining the nine worlds of the cosmos in its roots and branches. Folklore On the Isle of Bute in Scotland, lovers reportedly used to eat leaves of an ash tree known as the \\"Dreamin' Tree\\" that grew near the church of St Blane, and the pleasant dreams they then experienced revealed their actual spouses and intended fates.Downie, R.

Overview Some of the issues studied by the philosophy of psychology are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example: * What is the most appropriate methodology for psychology: mentalism, behaviorism, or a compromise? * Are self-reports a reliable data-gathering method? * What conclusions can be drawn from null hypothesis tests? * Can first-person experiences (emotions, desires, beliefs, etc.) be measured objectively? Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind, such as: * What is a cognitive module? * Are humans rational creatures? * What psychological phenomena come up to the standard required for calling it knowledge? * What is innateness? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see Donald Broadbent), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see supervenience)); whether the mind is \\"hard-wired\\" enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988). Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field because \\"scientific\\" psychology‚Äîthat is, the psychology that favors experimental methods over introspection‚Äîcame to dominate psychological studies only in the late 19th century. One of philosophy of psychology's concerns is to evaluate the merits of the many different schools of psychology that have been and are practiced. For example, cognitive psychology's use of internal mental states might be compared with behaviorism, and the reasons for the widespread rejection of behaviorism in the mid-20th century examined. Topics that fall within the Philosophy of mind go back much farther. For example, questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism have been discussed in philosophy for many centuries. Related to the philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about clinical psychiatry and psychopathology. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical value theory and phenomenology, values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care. Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of psychiatric classification and evidence-based psychiatry. It aims is to unveil the constructive activity underlying the description of mental phenomena.

Accessed 30 December 2012 It was a major battle of the Wars of the Roses. The opposing forces were an army led by Jasper Tudor and his father, Owen Tudor, and other nobles loyal to King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and their seven-year-old son, Edward, Prince of Wales, on one side, and the army of Edward, Earl of March. Some sources say it was fought on 3 February, and the exact location has been the subject of some speculation.UK Battlefields Resource Centre. Accessed 30 December 2012 Background In 1460, with King Henry VI a prisoner, Richard, Duke of York (father of Edward, Earl of March) attempted to depose Henry and become king himself. His closest supporters dissuaded him from this step, but he secured an Act of Accord by which he and his descendants would inherit the throne on Henry's death, thus disinheriting Henry's young son Edward, Prince of Wales. Inspired by Henry's queen, Margaret of Anjou, York's enemies and rivals began gathering armies in Wales and Northern England. York sent Edward of March, his 18-year-old eldest son, to gather support in the Welsh Marches while he himself led an army to the north. On 30 December, York led his men into a trap at the Battle of Wakefield where he was killed. With York's death, his titles and claim to the throne descended to Edward of March, now 4th duke of York.Battle for Mortimer's Cross: History. Accessed 30 December 2012 He sought to prevent Lancastrian forces from Wales, led by Owen Tudor and his son Jasper, Earl of Pembroke, from joining up with the main body of Lancastrian forces. The elder Tudor had been second husband to Catherine of Valois, widow of Henry V; their sons (Jasper and Edmund Tudor), as Henry VI's half-brothers, had been made earls, and the family became a major power in South Wales. His army included Welshmen, drawn especially from the area of the Tudor lands in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, along with French and Breton mercenaries and Irish troops led by James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond.The Battlefields of Britain, Kincross, J., London 1988, p.84 Edward, based at Wigmore Castle had gathered his army from the English border counties and from Wales. Among his leading supporters present were Lord Audley, Lord Grey of Wilton, Sir William Herbert of Raglan, Sir Walter Devereux and Humphrey Stafford.Charles Ross, Edward IV, (University of California Press, 1974), 31. After spending Christmas in Gloucester, he began to prepare to return to London. However, Jasper Tudor's hostile army was approaching and he changed his plan; so as to block Pembroke's advance and block him from meeting up with the main Lancastrian force which was approaching London, Edward moved north with an army of approximately five thousand men to Mortimer's Cross. Parhelion As dawn broke, the meteorological phenomenon known as parhelion occurred: three suns were seen to be rising. The appearance of this sun dog so soon before the battle seems to have frightened his troops, but Edward of York appears to have convinced them that it represented the Holy Trinity and that therefore God was on their side. He later took it as his emblem, the \\"Sun in splendour\\". The event was dramatised by William Shakespeare in King Henry VI, Part 3The Mortimer‚Äôs Cross Parhelion: How a Meteorological Phenomenon Changed English History(See below) and in Sharon Kay Penman's The Sunne In Splendour. Battle One of York's advisers, Sir Richard Croft, a local lord from Croft Castle, recommended positioning archers at the crossroads (now the A4110 and B4362 junction) in order to halt the Lancastrian advance. Pembroke's army was about a thousand men smaller than York's and, being untried in battle at that point, may not have originally planned to fight but by midday it was clear that they would have to in order to cross the Lugg. The Lancastrians commenced the attack ‚Äì Butler's ‚Äòbattle‚Äô (division) led the first assault forcing Edward's right wing to retreat across the road, where this flank dissolved. Pembroke faced Edward's centre division and was held off but, most decisively, Owen Tudor attempted an encirclement of the Yorkist left wing; his ‚Äòbattle‚Äô was defeated and a rout commenced. Pembroke's centre then also broke and the battle was won. Owen Tudor's men were now in full flight: some of them were followed as far as Hereford, approximately seventeen miles, and where Owen was himself captured and beheaded. Aftermath The battle having intruded on York's plans to march to the midlands, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, with the captive King Henry in his train, was meanwhile forced to move to block Margaret's army's route to London on his own. He took up position north of St Albans astride the main road from the north (the ancient Roman road known as Watling Street). Although he lost the battle that followed, and Margaret of Anjou and her army could now march unopposed on to London, they did not do so. The Lancastrian army's reputation for pillage caused the Londoners to bar the gates. This in turn caused Margaret to hesitate, as did the news of the Yorkist victory at Mortimer's Cross. The Lancastrians fell back through Dunstable, losing many Scots and Borderers who deserted and returned home with the plunder they had already gathered. Edward of March and Warwick entered London on 2 March, and Edward was quickly proclaimed King Edward IV of England. Within a few weeks he had confirmed his hold on the throne with a decisive victory at the Battle of Towton. Alignment controversy Kingsland Conventional sketch maps of Mortimer's Cross show the armies facing each other across the valley with the River Lugg at the rear of Edward's Yorkist army. This almost east/west alignment is partly based on the supposed approach routes of both armies. It has been pointed out that this would mean that Yorkist Edward had the river at his back, an obstacle which would invite disaster if the Yorkists were either pushed back or routed. His fleeing men would be cut down from behind while trying to wade the shallows. Edward was known to be militarily astute (or at least well advised) and he is likely to have been well aware of this risk. Writing for Hobilar, the Journal of the Lance and Longbow Society Lance and Longbow Society, Hobilar 23, February 1997 Andy Lamkowski suggests that a second battlefield alignment is quite plausible; that Edward drew up across the valley with the River Lugg on his left (with the Yorkists facing almost south) and the Lancastrians drew up facing almost north with the river on their right. The narrowness of the valley close to the bridge would probably mean that the two armies each drew up in a column of three divisions - if they fought close to the river crossing - but the ground widens significantly towards the present Battle Acre Cottage and Drybridge House. At that point a traditional 'three units' battle linevarward (right) main guard (centre) and rear guard (left) is possible. Author Andrew Boardman The Battle of Towton, Boardman, 1994 also suggests that an alternative interpretation is possible saying: \\"It may be safe to assume that the battle was fought somewhere in the vicinity, possibly with the river securing the flanks of both armies and the hills the other\\". Andrew Boardman also quotes William Gregory (Gregory's Chronicle)The Battle of Towton page 37 saying that Edward: \\"Met his enemies on a fair plain near to Mortimer's Cross, not far from Hereford East\\". The usual placing of the battle in the valley beside the bridge is not 'a fair plain' but the area around Battle Acre Cottage or Drybridge House - to the south-south east - meets that description. Andy Lamkowski also makes the point that if the Lancastrian force approached from the south rather than the west then a north/south alignment is more likely, Edward would be deploying across the valley width to prevent them moving north and would have the advantage of anchoring his flanks on the slopes of the narrowing valley and/or the River Lugg itself. In Shakespeare Shakespeare described this parhelion phenomenon and its portentous symbolism in Act Two Scene One of Henry VI, Part 3: :Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun; :Not separated with the racking clouds, :But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. :See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss, :As if they vow'd some league inviolable: :Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. :In this the heaven figures some event. Shakespeare omits mention of the battle.

Role-playing industry career =Early years= Cook has been a professional game designer since 1988, working primarily on role-playing games. Much of his early work was for Iron Crown Enterprises as an editor and writer for the Rolemaster and Champions lines. For a time, Cook was the editor in charge of the \\"Campaign Classics\\" line of books for the Hero System and Rolemaster lines. Cook worked for Iron Crown Enterprises for four years; two as a freelancer and two as a full-time designer. During this period, Cook wrote the multi-genre setting Dark Space (1990), a fantasy/science-fiction/horror setting. Cook became the line editor for Hero System, replacing Rob Bell, who left ICE in 1990. =TSR= Cook began working for TSR in 1992 as a freelancer: \\"writing a whole slew of stuff for the old Marvel game that never came out because the game got canceled\\". In 1994 Cook came to work at TSR as a game designer. Cook designed Dungeons & Dragons modules such as Labyrinth of Madness (1995) and A Paladin in Hell (1998), and dozens of supplements to the Planescape line including The Planewalker's Handbook (1996) and Dead Gods (1998). Cook also designed the conspiracy game Dark‚Ä¢Matter in 1999. =Wizards of the Coast= After TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast, Cook became a senior designer, and was part of the team working on the D&D; game's third edition. Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition Players Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Cook was proud of the work he did on the new Dungeon Master's Guide, especially after Gary Gygax gave his team feedback on the book: \\"He said that the material in the new DMG would help him become a better DM... That was really cool‚Äìand satisfying in a 'completion of the circle' sort of way.\\" In 2000, Cook said of his involvement with Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons & Dragons: \\"It's a great time to be working here... because every product is big, important, and innovative.\\" Cook also worked on Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil, and the d20 Call of Cthulhu (February 2002). =d20 licensed works and Malhovoc Press = Cook left Wizards of the Coast in 2001. Cook's Beyond the Veil (2001) was one of the later books in Atlas Games' \\"Penumbra\\" line of d20 System books. Cook started a new company Malhavoc Press in 2001 as an imprint of White Wolf's Sword & Sorcery Studios, with the d20 The Book of Eldritch Might (2001) as his first product. The Book of Eldritch Might was the first commercial book published exclusively as a PDF that was released by a print publisher. It was an immediate success and has been credited with demonstrating the viability of PDF publishing within the role-playing industry. This and other early Malhavoc products were initially released only in electronic format, though print versions of most of them have since been released by White Wolf, Inc. Malhavoc Press worked with Fiery Dragon Productions after the latter left Sword & Sorcery in 2002, and the majority of Fiery Dragon's licenses were taken from Malhavoc. Cook's work under the Malhavoc banner has included Arcana Unearthed: A Variant Players Handbook. Arcana Unearthed is set in Cook's world of \\"The Diamond Throne\\", a giant-dominated setting. He caused controversy in mid-2004 by exclusively selling his electronic d20 material with the DriveThruRPG.com store, which then used only a proprietary digital rights management-encrypted PDF system. He eventually succumbed to pressure from his customers to sell his products in standard-PDF form, and DriveThruRPG has more recently done the same. In August 2006, Malhavoc released Ptolus, a campaign setting based on Monte Cook's home game that was used as the playtest campaign for the third edition D&D; designers. Shortly after the release of Ptolus, which Cook has often described as the culmination of his original ambitions for Malhavoc, he announced that he would be focusing on writing fiction and other unspecified forms of creative work, rather than role-playing games, for the foreseeable future. White Wolf and Goodman Games announced his final RPG books. Monte Cook's World of Darkness, his own take on White Wolf's modern horror setting, was released at Gen Con 2007. From Goodman Games is Dungeon Crawl Classics: #50, Vault of the Iron Overlord, which was also targeted for the same Gen Con release. However, due to demand by fans reading his live journal, and posting their desires on the Malhavoc message boards, Monte Cook released one more RPG product in early 2008, The Book of Experimental Might. This was quickly followed by The Book of Experimental Might II: Bloody, Bold and Resolute. =D&D; Next= Cook returned to Wizards of the Coast in 2011. On September 20, 2011, Mike Mearls announced that Cook would be taking over his \\"Legends & Lore\\" column for the Wizards of the Coast website. In January 2012, it was revealed that Cook was to be the lead designer for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In April 2012, Cook announced his departure from Wizards of the Coast due to \\"differences of opinion with the company\\" but not \\"with [his] fellow designers\\". =Monte Cook Games and Numenera= Cook co-founded Monte Cook Games, LLC with Shanna Germain in 2012, which is a roleplaying game company that has produced Numenera, The Strange, The Cypher System Rulebook, Invisible Sun, and No Thank You, Evil! which went to press in Fall 2015 after a Kickstarter campaign raised over $100,000 to fund its publication. Numenera is a Kickstarter-funded table-top RPG created by Cook, set a billion years in the future in a science fantasy and post-apocalyptic setting with streamlined rules that prioritize the story, the action, and the wild ideas. It raised over $500,000 (more than 25 times its goal of $20,000). System playtesting was announced on October 30, 2012, and the game was released on August 14, 2013. Cook has stated that David \\"Zeb\\" Cook's (no relation) Planescape fantasy world was a significant influence on concepts in Numenera. The Ninth World of Numenera was also the setting for a 2013 release of the Thunderstone Advance deck-building game by Alderac Entertainment Group, as well as the 2017 video game Torment: Tides of Numenera, which was developed by InXile Entertainment after a successful Kickstarter campaign. The Strange is a Kickstarter-funded table-top RPG created by Cook and Bruce Cordell using the same Cypher System ruleset as Numenera. The game, which involves traveling through different worlds known as Recursions, was released in August 2014. Invisible Sun is a Kickstarter-funded table-top role-playing game created by Monte Cook Games, with a street date released of September 20, 2018. It is a surreal fantasy game with many game accessories. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/montecookgames/invisible-sun/ Author career Monte Cook is a graduate of the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writer's Workshop.

Algebraic varieties are the central objects of study in algebraic geometry, a sub-field of mathematics. Classically, an algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions generalize this concept in several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition. Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ slightly. For example, some definitions require an algebraic variety to be irreducible, which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology. Under this definition, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets. Other conventions do not require irreducibility. The fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial (an algebraic object) in one variable with complex number coefficients is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object) in the complex plane. Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is a defining feature of algebraic geometry. Many algebraic varieties are manifolds, but an algebraic variety may have singular points while a manifold cannot. Algebraic varieties can be characterized by their dimension. Algebraic varieties of dimension one are called algebraic curves and algebraic varieties of dimension two are called algebraic surfaces. In the context of modern scheme theory, an algebraic variety over a field is an integral (irreducible and reduced) scheme over that field whose structure morphism is separated and of finite type. Overview and definitions An affine variety over an algebraically closed field is conceptually the easiest type of variety to define, which will be done in this section. Next, one can define projective and quasi-projective varieties in a similar way. The most general definition of a variety is obtained by patching together smaller quasi-projective varieties. It is not obvious that one can construct genuinely new examples of varieties in this way, but Nagata gave an example of such a new variety in the 1950s. =Affine varieties= For an algebraically closed field K and a natural number n, let be affine n-space over K. The polynomials in the ring can be viewed as K-valued functions on by evaluating at the points in , i.e. by choosing values in K for each xi. For each set S of polynomials in , define the zero-locus Z(S) to be the set of points in on which the functions in S simultaneously vanish, that is to say :Z(S) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{A}^n \\\\mid f(x) = 0 \\\\text{ for all } f\\\\in S \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. A subset V of is called an affine algebraic set if V = Z(S) for some S. A nonempty affine algebraic set V is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets. An irreducible affine algebraic set is also called an affine variety. (Many authors use the phrase affine variety to refer to any affine algebraic set, irreducible or notHartshorne, p.xv, notes that his choice is not conventional; see for example, Harris, p.3) Affine varieties can be given a natural topology by declaring the closed sets to be precisely the affine algebraic sets. This topology is called the Zariski topology. Given a subset V of , we define I(V) to be the ideal of all polynomial functions vanishing on V: :I(V) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{f \\\\in K[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] \\\\mid f(x) = 0 \\\\text{ for all } x\\\\in V \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. For any affine algebraic set V, the coordinate ring or structure ring of V is the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal. =Projective varieties and quasi-projective varieties= Let be an algebraically closed field and let be the projective n-space over . Let in be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d. It is not well-defined to evaluate on points in in homogeneous coordinates. However, because is homogeneous, meaning that , it does make sense to ask whether vanishes at a point . For each set S of homogeneous polynomials, define the zero-locus of S to be the set of points in on which the functions in S vanish: :Z(S) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{P}^n \\\\mid f(x) = 0 \\\\text{ for all } f\\\\in S\\\\\\\\}. A subset V of is called a projective algebraic set if V = Z(S) for some S. An irreducible projective algebraic set is called a projective variety. Projective varieties are also equipped with the Zariski topology by declaring all algebraic sets to be closed. Given a subset V of , let I(V) be the ideal generated by all homogeneous polynomials vanishing on V. For any projective algebraic set V, the coordinate ring of V is the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal. A quasi-projective variety is a Zariski open subset of a projective variety. Notice that every affine variety is quasi-projective.Hartshorne, Exercise I.2.9, p.12 Notice also that the complement of an algebraic set in an affine variety is a quasi-projective variety; in the context of affine varieties, such a quasi-projective variety is usually not called a variety but a constructible set. =Abstract varieties= In classical algebraic geometry, all varieties were by definition quasi-projective varieties, meaning that they were open subvarieties of closed subvarieties of projective space. For example, in Chapter 1 of Hartshorne a variety over an algebraically closed field is defined to be a quasi-projective variety, but from Chapter 2 onwards, the term variety (also called an abstract variety) refers to a more general object, which locally is a quasi-projective variety, but when viewed as a whole is not necessarily quasi-projective; i.e. it might not have an embedding into projective space. So classically the definition of an algebraic variety required an embedding into projective space, and this embedding was used to define the topology on the variety and the regular functions on the variety. The disadvantage of such a definition is that not all varieties come with natural embeddings into projective space. For example, under this definition, the product is not a variety until it is embedded into the projective space; this is usually done by the Segre embedding. However, any variety that admits one embedding into projective space admits many others by composing the embedding with the Veronese embedding. Consequently, many notions that should be intrinsic, such as the concept of a regular function, are not obviously so. The earliest successful attempt to define an algebraic variety abstractly, without an embedding, was made by Andr√© Weil. In his Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, Weil defined an abstract algebraic variety using valuations. Claude Chevalley made a definition of a scheme, which served a similar purpose, but was more general. However, Alexander Grothendieck's definition of a scheme is more general still and has received the most widespread acceptance. In Grothendieck's language, an abstract algebraic variety is usually defined to be an integral, separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field, although some authors drop the irreducibility or the reducedness or the separateness condition or allow the underlying field to be not algebraically closed.Liu, Qing. Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves, p. 55 Definition 2.3.47, and p. 88 Example 3.2.3 Classical algebraic varieties are the quasiprojective integral separated finite type schemes over an algebraically closed field. Existence of non-quasiprojective abstract algebraic varieties One of the earliest examples of a non-quasiprojective algebraic variety were given by Nagata. Nagata's example was not complete (the analog of compactness), but soon afterwards he found an algebraic surface that was complete and non- projective. Since then other examples have been found. Examples =Subvariety= A subvariety is a subset of a variety that is itself a variety (with respect to the structure induced from the ambient variety). For example, every open subset of a variety is a variety. See also closed immersion. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that closed subvarieties of an affine or projective variety are in one-to-one correspondence with the prime ideals or homogeneous prime ideals of the coordinate ring of the variety. =Affine variety= Example 1 Let , and A2 be the two-dimensional affine space over C. Polynomials in the ring C[x, y] can be viewed as complex valued functions on A2 by evaluating at the points in A2. Let subset S of C[x, y] contain a single element : :f(x, y) = x+y-1. The zero-locus of is the set of points in A2 on which this function vanishes: it is the set of all pairs of complex numbers (x, y) such that y = 1 ‚àí x. This is called a line in the affine plane. (In the classical topology coming from the topology on the complex numbers, a complex line is a real manifold of dimension two.) This is the set : :Z(f) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,1-x) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}^2 \\\\\\\\}. Thus the subset of A2 is an algebraic set. The set V is not empty. It is irreducible, as it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets. Thus it is an affine algebraic variety. Example 2 Let , and A2 be the two-dimensional affine space over C. Polynomials in the ring C[x, y] can be viewed as complex valued functions on A2 by evaluating at the points in A2. Let subset S of C[x, y] contain a single element g(x, y): :g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1. The zero-locus of g(x, y) is the set of points in A2 on which this function vanishes, that is the set of points (x,y) such that x2 \\\\+ y2 = 1. As g(x, y) is an absolutely irreducible polynomial, this is an algebraic variety. The set of its real points (that is the points for which x and y are real numbers), is known as the unit circle; this name is also often given to the whole variety. Example 3 The following example is neither a hypersurface, nor a linear space, nor a single point. Let A3 be the three-dimensional affine space over C. The set of points (x, x2, x3) for x in C is an algebraic variety, and more precisely an algebraic curve that is not contained in any plane.Harris, p.9; that it is irreducible is stated as an exercise in Hartshorne p.7 It is the twisted cubic shown in the above figure. It may be defined by the equations :\\\\begin{align} y-x^2&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ z-x^3&=0 \\\\end{align} The irreducibility of this algebraic set needs a proof. One approach in this case is to check that the projection (x, y, z) ‚Üí (x, y) is injective on the set of the solutions and that its image is an irreducible plane curve. For more difficult examples, a similar proof may always be given, but may imply a difficult computation: first a Gr√∂bner basis computation to compute the dimension, followed by a random linear change of variables (not always needed); then a Gr√∂bner basis computation for another monomial ordering to compute the projection and to prove that it is generically injective and that its image is a hypersurface, and finally a polynomial factorization to prove the irreducibility of the image. = Projective variety = A projective variety is a closed subvariety of a projective space. That is, it is the zero locus of a set of homogeneous polynomials that generate a prime ideal.  Example 1  The affine plane curve y2 = x3 ‚àí x. The corresponding projective curve is called an elliptic curve. A plane projective curve is the zero locus of an irreducible homogeneous polynomial in three indeterminates. The projective line P1 is an example of a projective curve; it can be viewed as the curve in the projective plane P2 = {[x, y, z]} defined by x = 0. For another example, first consider the affine cubic curve :y^2 = x^3 - x. in the 2-dimensional affine space (over a field of characteristic not two). It has the associated cubic homogeneous polynomial equation: :y^2z = x^3 - xz^2, which defines a curve in P2 called an elliptic curve. The curve has genus one (genus formula); in particular, it is not isomorphic to the projective line P1, which has genus zero. Using genus to distinguish curves is very basic: in fact, the genus is the first invariant one uses to classify curves (see also the construction of moduli of algebraic curves).  Example 2  Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian variety Gn(V) is the set of all n-dimensional subspaces of V. It is a projective variety: it is embedded into a projective space via the Pl√ºcker embedding: :\\\\begin{cases} G_n(V) \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left (\\\\wedge^n V \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle b_1, \\\\ldots, b_n \\\\rangle \\\\mapsto [b_1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge b_n] \\\\end{cases} where bi are any set of linearly independent vectors in V, \\\\wedge^n V is the n-th exterior power of V, and the bracket [w] means the line spanned by the nonzero vector w. The Grassmannian variety comes with a natural vector bundle (or locally free sheaf in other terminology) called the tautological bundle, which is important in the study of characteristic classes such as Chern classes. = Non-affine and non-projective example = An algebraic variety can be neither affine nor projective. To give an example, let X = P1 √ó A1 and p: X ‚Üí A1 the projection. It is an algebraic variety since it is a product of varieties. It is not affine since P1 is a closed subvariety of X (as the zero locus of p), but an affine variety cannot contain a projective variety of positive dimension as a closed subvariety. It is not projective either, since there is a nonconstant regular function on X; namely, p. Another example of a non-affine non- projective variety is X = A2 \\\\- (0, 0) (cf. morphism of varieties#Examples.) Basic results * An affine algebraic set V is a variety if and only if I(V) is a prime ideal; equivalently, V is a variety if and only if its coordinate ring is an * Every nonempty affine algebraic set may be written uniquely as a finite union of algebraic varieties (where none of the varieties in the decomposition is a subvariety of any other). * The dimension of a variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. See Dimension of an algebraic variety for details. * A product of finitely many algebraic varieties (over an algebraically closed field) is an algebraic variety.  Isomorphism of algebraic varieties  Let be algebraic varieties. We say and are isomorphic, and write , if there are regular maps and such that the compositions and are the identity maps on and respectively. Discussion and generalizations The basic definitions and facts above enable one to do classical algebraic geometry. To be able to do more -- for example, to deal with varieties over fields that are not algebraically closed -- some foundational changes are required. The modern notion of a variety is considerably more abstract than the one above, though equivalent in the case of varieties over algebraically closed fields. An abstract algebraic variety is a particular kind of scheme; the generalization to schemes on the geometric side enables an extension of the correspondence described above to a wider class of rings. A scheme is a locally ringed space such that every point has a neighbourhood that, as a locally ringed space, is isomorphic to a spectrum of a ring. Basically, a variety over is a scheme whose structure sheaf is a sheaf of -algebras with the property that the rings R that occur above are all integral domains and are all finitely generated -algebras, that is to say, they are quotients of polynomial algebras by prime ideals. This definition works over any field . It allows you to glue affine varieties (along common open sets) without worrying whether the resulting object can be put into some projective space. This also leads to difficulties since one can introduce somewhat pathological objects, e.g. an affine line with zero doubled. Such objects are usually not considered varieties, and are eliminated by requiring the schemes underlying a variety to be separated. (Strictly speaking, there is also a third condition, namely, that one needs only finitely many affine patches in the definition above.) Some modern researchers also remove the restriction on a variety having integral domain affine charts, and when speaking of a variety only require that the affine charts have trivial nilradical. A complete variety is a variety such that any map from an open subset of a nonsingular curve into it can be extended uniquely to the whole curve. Every projective variety is complete, but not vice versa. These varieties have been called \\"varieties in the sense of Serre\\", since Serre's foundational paper FAC on sheaf cohomology was written for them. They remain typical objects to start studying in algebraic geometry, even if more general objects are also used in an auxiliary way. One way that leads to generalizations is to allow reducible algebraic sets (and fields that aren't algebraically closed), so the rings R may not be integral domains. A more significant modification is to allow nilpotents in the sheaf of rings, that is, rings which are not reduced. This is one of several generalizations of classical algebraic geometry that are built into Grothendieck's theory of schemes. Allowing nilpotent elements in rings is related to keeping track of \\"multiplicities\\" in algebraic geometry. For example, the closed subscheme of the affine line defined by x2 = 0 is different from the subscheme defined by x = 0 (the origin). More generally, the fiber of a morphism of schemes X ‚Üí Y at a point of Y may be non-reduced, even if X and Y are reduced. Geometrically, this says that fibers of good mappings may have nontrivial \\"infinitesimal\\" structure. There are further generalizations called algebraic spaces and stacks. Algebraic manifolds An algebraic manifold is an algebraic variety that is also an m-dimensional manifold, and hence every sufficiently small local patch is isomorphic to km. Equivalently, the variety is smooth (free from singular points). When is the real numbers, R, algebraic manifolds are called Nash manifolds. Algebraic manifolds can be defined as the zero set of a finite collection of analytic algebraic functions. Projective algebraic manifolds are an equivalent definition for projective varieties. The Riemann sphere is one example.

History  The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of information theory in the early 1920s. Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying \\"intelligence\\" and the \\"line speed\\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system. Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word \\"information\\" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers. The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon (1916‚Äì2001) in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948 under the title \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory. \\"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.\\" In 1949, in a declassified version of Shannon¬¥s wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography (\\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\\"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article \\"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\\" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.  Models of communication  New models of communication came from the humanities like psychology and sociology and anthropology, for example Gregory Bateson and Paul Watzlawick at the Mental Research Institute at Stanford University. Scholars from disciplines other than mathematics and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model': According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, Communication Theory as a Field (1999), communication theory ‚Äúconsist of seven traditions that are [‚Ä¶] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.‚Äù \\"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.‚Äù (Craig, 1999, p. 143) The most commonly described Models of Communication: The Linear Model of communication works in one direction only, a sender encodes some message and sends it through a channel for a receiver to decode. In comparison, the Interactional Model of communication works bidirectional. People send and receive messages in a cooperative fashion as they continuously encode and decode information. The Transactional Model then assumes that information is sent and received simultaneously through a noisy channel, and further considers a frame of reference or experience each person brings to the interaction.  Elements of communication  Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory: * Source: Shannon calls this element the \\"information source\\", which \\"produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal.\\" * Sender: Shannon calls this element the \\"transmitter\\", which \\"operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.\\" In Aristotle, this element is the \\"speaker\\" (orator). * Channel: For Shannon, the channel is \\"merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver.\\" * Receiver: For Shannon, the receiver \\"performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.\\" * Destination: For Shannon, the destination is \\"the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended\\". * Message: from Latin mittere, \\"to send\\". The message is a concept, information, communication, or statement that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient. * Feedback * Entropic elements, positive and negative Notes  References   Further reading  * Chandler, Daniel.

Zalta (ed.), URL = . Spencer originated the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\", which he coined in Principles of Biology (1864) after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. The term strongly suggests natural selection, yet Spencer saw evolution as extending into realms of sociology and ethics, so he also supported Lamarckism. Riggenbach, Jeff (24 April 2011) The Real William Graham Sumner, Mises Institute Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. \\"The only other English philosopher to have achieved anything like such widespread popularity was Bertrand Russell, and that was in the 20th century.\\"Richards, Peter (4 November 2010) Herbert Spencer: Social Darwinist or Libertarian Prophet?, Mises Institute Spencer was \\"the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century\\"Thomas Eriksen and FinnNielsen, A history of anthropology (2001) p. 37\\"Spencer became the most famous philosopher of his time,\\" says Henry L.

Crane Brinton, English Political Thought in the Nineteenth Century (London: Benn, 1933). Life Spencer was born in Derby, England, on 27 April 1820, the son of William George Spencer (generally called George).https://www.iep.utm.edu/spencer/ Spencer's father was a religious dissenter who drifted from Methodism to Quakerism, and who seems to have transmitted to his son an opposition to all forms of authority. He ran a school founded on the progressive teaching methods of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and also served as Secretary of the Derby Philosophical Society, a scientific society which had been founded in 1783 by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Spencer was educated in empirical science by his father, while the members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer,Rev. Thomas Spencer (14 October 1796 ‚Äì 26 January. 1853) ‚Äì See: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26138/?back=,36208 vicar of Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed Spencer's limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough Latin to enable him to translate some easy texts. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer pp. 53‚Äì55 As a young man Both as an adolescent and as a young man, Spencer found it difficult to settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics. From 1848 to 1853 he served as sub-editor on the free-trade journal The Economist, during which time he published his first book, Social Statics (1851), which predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state. Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewes and Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained his lifelong friend. However, it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic and with Auguste Comte's positivism and which set him on the road to his life's work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer p. 113 The first fruit of his friendship with Evans and Lewes was Spencer's second book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, which explored a physiological basis for psychology. The book was founded on the fundamental assumption that the human mind was subject to natural laws and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology. This permitted the adoption of a developmental perspective not merely in terms of the individual (as in traditional psychology), but also of the species and the race. Through this paradigm, Spencer aimed to reconcile the associationist psychology of Mill's Logic, the notion that human mind was constructed from atomic sensations held together by the laws of the association of ideas, with the apparently more 'scientific' theory of phrenology, which located specific mental functions in specific parts of the brain.In 1844, Spencer published three articles on phrenology in The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare: \\"A New View of the Functions of Imitation and Benevolence\\" (Vol.1, No.4, (January 1844), pp. 369‚Äì85); \\"On the Situation of the Organ of Amativeness\\" (Vol.2, No.6, (July 1844), pp. 186‚Äì89); and \\"A Theory concerning the Organ of Wonder\\" (Vol.2, No.7, (October 1844), pp. 316‚Äì25). Spencer argued that both these theories were partial accounts of the truth: repeated associations of ideas were embodied in the formation of specific strands of brain tissue, and these could be passed from one generation to the next by means of the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance. The Psychology, he believed, would do for the human mind what Isaac Newton had done for matter.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer p. 75 However, the book was not initially successful and the last of the 251 copies of its first edition were not sold until June 1861. Spencer's interest in psychology derived from a more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer p. 537 In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it was possible to show that everything in the universe ‚Äì including human culture, language, and morality ‚Äì could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Syst√®me de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution. In 1858 Spencer produced an outline of what was to become the System of Synthetic Philosophy. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applied in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte's term for the new discipline) and morality. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end it took him twice as long and consumed almost all the rest of his long life. Despite Spencer's early struggles to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become the most famous philosopher of the age.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer p. 497 His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to support himself solely on the profit of book sales and on income from his regular contributions to Victorian periodicals which were collected as three volumes of Essays. His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and into many other languages and he was offered honours and awards all over Europe and North America. He also became a member of the Athenaeum, an exclusive Gentleman's Club in London open only to those distinguished in the arts and sciences, and the X Club, a dining club of nine founded by T.H. Huxley that met every month and included some of the most prominent thinkers of the Victorian age (three of whom would become presidents of the Royal Society). Members included physicist-philosopher John Tyndall and Darwin's cousin, the banker and biologist Sir John Lubbock. There were also some quite significant satellites such as liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster; and guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views. Despite his growing wealth and fame he never owned a house of his own. The last decades of Spencer's life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a perpetual hypochondriac who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose at that time. By the 1890s his readership had begun to desert him while many of his closest friends died and he had come to doubt the confident faith in progress that he had made the center-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas Social Statics had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the Liberty and Property Defence League against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of William Ewart Gladstone ‚Äì largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer's political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, The Man Versus the State. Tomb, Highgate Cemetery The exception to Spencer's growing conservatism was that he remained throughout his life an ardent opponent of imperialism and militarism. His critique of the Boer War was especially scathing, and it contributed to his declining popularity in Britain.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer p. 464 Spencer also invented a precursor to the modern paper clip, though it looked more like a modern cotter pin. This \\"binding-pin\\" was distributed by Ackermann & Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses. In 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature, that was assigned to the German Theodor Mommsen. He continued writing all his life, in later years often by dictation, until he succumbed to poor health at the age of 83. His ashes are interred in the eastern side of London's Highgate Cemetery facing Karl Marx's grave. At Spencer's funeral the Indian nationalist leader Shyamji Krishna Varma announced a donation of ¬£1,000 to establish a lectureship at Oxford University in tribute to Spencer and his work.Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer, p. 537 Synthetic philosophy The basis for Spencer's appeal to many of his generation was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith at a time when orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science. Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in the ultimate perfection of humanity on the basis of advanced scientific conceptions such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological evolution. In essence Spencer's philosophical vision was formed by a combination of deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy. Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held that it was possible to discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man. The second objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws led inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge in the form of the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace's nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development' (Lewes' phrase). Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy. Evolution Burgess, 1871‚Äì72 Spencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's Westminster Review in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'The Theory of Life' ‚Äì itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturphilosophie ‚Äì with a generalisation of von Baer's law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while being accompanied by a process of greater integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be found at work, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, that was applying to the stars and the galaxies as much as to biological organisms, and to human social organisation as much as to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only by its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle. The principles described by Herbert Spencer received different interpretations. Bertrand Russell stated in a letter to Beatrice Webb in 1923: 'I don't know whether [Spencer] was ever made to realize the implications of the second law of thermodynamics; if so, he may well be upset. The law says that everything tends to uniformity and a dead level, diminishing (not increasing) heterogeneity'. quoted in The alleged contradiction between Spencer's theory and the second law of thermodynamics might arise from limiting the definition of homogeneity and heterogeneity to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of matter. For instance, according to the second law of thermodynamics, molecules of gas filling a room eventually fill the room at similar intervals. On the other hand, the directions of motion of the molecules become more heterogeneous. Increasing heterogeneity of this sort aligns with the increase of entropy, related to the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the macroscopic quantities characterizing the system. Herbert Spencer considers Evolution, defined as the integration of matter and the dissipation of motion, to be necessarily followed by Dissolution, defined as the dissipation of matter and the integration of motion. Therefore, the heterogeneity of matter alone is not claimed to be ever increasing. Additionally, Herbert Spencer states that Dissolution goes towards Equilibration, a state of the system with no differential Force between its parts. A comparison can be made of such state with Thermodynamic equilibrium, a state with no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy. Spencer's attempt to explain the evolution of complexity was radically different from that to be found in Darwin's Origin of Species which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on natural selection. But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's mind had evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race. Spencer in his book Principles of Biology (1864), proposed a pangenesis theory that involved \\"physiological units\\" assumed to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics to offspring. These hypothetical hereditary units were similar to Darwin's gemmules.Deichmann, Ute. (2010). Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology. Springer. pp. 41‚Äì42. Sociology In his 70s Spencer read with excitement the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte. A philosopher of science, Comte had proposed a theory of sociocultural evolution that society progresses by a general law of three stages. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy which Spencer placed on evolution, his sociology might be described as social Darwinism mixed with Lamarckism. However, despite its popularity, this view of Spencer's sociology is mistaken. While his political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are absent in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing degrees of complexity in social organization The evolutionary progression from simple, undifferentiated homogeneity to complex, differentiated heterogeneity was exemplified, Spencer argued, by the development of society. He developed a theory of two types of society, the militant and the industrial, which corresponded to this evolutionary progression. Militant society, structured around relationships of hierarchy and obedience, was simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, was complex and differentiated. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a 'social organism' evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. Moreover, industrial society was the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in Social Statics, although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in anarchism (as he had first believed) or whether it pointed to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defense. Though Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on structural functionalism, his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous. Hermeneuticians of the period, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, would pioneer the distinction between the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften) and human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). In the United States, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward, who would be elected as the first president of the American Sociological Association, launched a relentless attack on Spencer's theories of laissez-faire and political ethics. Although Ward admired much of Spencer's work he believed that Spencer's prior political biases had distorted his thought and had led him astray.Popular Science Monthly, Volume 44 In the 1890s, √âmile Durkheim established formal academic sociology with a firm emphasis on practical social research. By the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, had presented methodological antipositivism. However, Spencer's theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer's importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously. Ethics The end point of the evolutionary process would be the creation of 'the perfect man in the perfect society' with human beings becoming completely adapted to social life, as predicted in Spencer's first book. The chief difference between Spencer's earlier and later conceptions of this process was the evolutionary timescale involved. The psychological ‚Äì and hence also the moral ‚Äì constitution which had been bequeathed to the present generation by our ancestors, and which we in turn would hand on to future generations, was in the process of gradual adaptation to the requirements of living in society. For example, aggression was a survival instinct which had been necessary in the primitive conditions of life, but was maladaptive in advanced societies. Because human instincts had a specific location in strands of brain tissue, they were subject to the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance so that gradual modifications could be transmitted to future generations. Over the course of many generations the evolutionary process would ensure that human beings would become less aggressive and increasingly altruistic, leading eventually to a perfect society in which no one would cause another person pain. However, for evolution to produce the perfect individual it was necessary for present and future generations to experience the 'natural' consequences of their conduct. Only in this way would individuals have the incentives required to work on self-improvement and thus to hand an improved moral constitution to their descendants. Hence anything that interfered with the 'natural' relationship of conduct and consequence was to be resisted and this included the use of the coercive power of the state to relieve poverty, to provide public education, or to require compulsory vaccination. Although charitable giving was to be encouraged even it had to be limited by the consideration that suffering was frequently the result of individuals receiving the consequences of their actions. Hence too much individual benevolence directed to the 'undeserving poor' would break the link between conduct and consequence that Spencer considered fundamental to ensuring that humanity continued to evolve to a higher level of development. Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value ‚Äì the greatest happiness of the greatest number ‚Äì and the culmination of the evolutionary process would be the maximization of utility. In the perfect society individuals would not only derive pleasure from the exercise of altruism ('positive beneficence') but would aim to avoid inflicting pain on others ('negative beneficence'). They would also instinctively respect the rights of others, leading to the universal observance of the principle of justice ‚Äì each person had the right to a maximum amount of liberty that was compatible with a like liberty in others. 'Liberty' was interpreted to mean the absence of coercion, and was closely connected to the right to private property. Spencer termed this code of conduct 'Absolute Ethics' which provided a scientifically-grounded moral system that could substitute for the supernaturally-based ethical systems of the past. However, he recognized that our inherited moral constitution does not currently permit us to behave in full compliance with the code of Absolute Ethics, and for this reason we need a code of 'Relative Ethics' which takes into account the distorting factors of our present imperfections. Spencer's distinctive view of musicology was also related to his ethics. Spencer thought that the origin of music is to be found in impassioned oratory. Speakers have persuasive effect not only by the reasoning of their words, but by their cadence and tone ‚Äì the musical qualities of their voice serve as \\"the commentary of the emotions upon the propositions of the intellect,\\" as Spencer put it. Music, conceived as the heightened development of this characteristic of speech, makes a contribution to the ethical education and progress of the species. \\"The strange capacity which we have for being affected by melody and harmony, may be taken to imply both that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those intenser delights they dimly suggest, and that they are in some way concerned in the realization of them. If so the power and the meaning of music become comprehensible; but otherwise they are a mystery.\\" Spencer's last years were characterized by a collapse of his initial optimism, replaced instead by a pessimism regarding the future of mankind. Nevertheless, he devoted much of his efforts in reinforcing his arguments and preventing the mis-interpretation of his monumental theory of non-interference. Agnosticism Spencer's reputation among the Victorians owed a great deal to his agnosticism. He rejected theology as representing the 'impiety of the pious.' He was to gain much notoriety from his repudiation of traditional religion, and was frequently condemned by religious thinkers for allegedly advocating atheism and materialism. Nonetheless, unlike Thomas Henry Huxley, whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at 'the unpardonable sin of faith' (in Adrian Desmond's phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned to undermine religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two. The following argument is a summary of Part 1 of his First Principles (2nd ed 1867). Starting either from religious belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether we are concerned with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, he thought that the Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges. Political views Spencerian views in 21st-century circulation derive from his political theories and memorable attacks on the reform movements of the late 19th century. He has been claimed as a precursor by libertarians and anarcho- capitalists. Economist Murray Rothbard called Social Statics \\"the greatest single work of libertarian political philosophy ever written.\\"Doherty, Brian, Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement, p. 246. Spencer argued that the state was not an \\"essential\\" institution and that it would \\"decay\\" as voluntary market organisation would replace the coercive aspects of the state.Stringham, Edward. Anarchy and the Law. Transaction Publishers, 2007. p. 387. He also argued that the individual had a \\"right to ignore the state.\\"Stringham, Edward. Anarchy and the Law. Transaction Publishers, 2007. p. 388. As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of patriotism. In response to being told that British troops were in danger during the Second Afghan War (1878-1880) he replied: \\"When men hire themselves out to shoot other men to order, asking nothing about the justice of their cause, I don't care if they are shot themselves.\\"Herbert Spencer, Facts and comments, p. 126. Politics in late Victorian Britain moved in directions that Spencer disliked, and his arguments provided so much ammunition for conservatives and individualists in Europe and America that they are still in use in the 21st century. The expression 'There is no alternative' (TINA), made famous by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer.Social Statics (1851), pp. 42, 307. By the 1880s he was denouncing \\"the new Toryism\\" (that is, the \\"social reformist wing\\" of the Liberal party ‚Äì the wing to some extent hostile to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, this faction of the Liberal party Spencer compared to the interventionist \\"Toryism\\" of such people as the former Conservative party Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli). In The Man versus the State (1884),The Man vs the State, 1884 at the Constitution Society he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called \\"Construction\\" ‚Äì an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed). Spencer denounced Irish land reform, compulsory education, laws to regulate safety at work, prohibition and temperance laws, tax funded libraries, and welfare reforms. His main objections were threefold: the use of the coercive powers of the government, the discouragement given to voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of the \\"laws of life.\\" The reforms, he said, were tantamount to \\"socialism\\", which he said was about the same as \\"slavery\\" in terms of limiting human freedom. Spencer vehemently attacked the widespread enthusiasm for annexation of colonies and imperial expansion, which subverted all he had predicted about evolutionary progress from 'militant' to 'industrial' societies and states.Ronald F. Cooney, \\"Herbert Spencer: Apostle of Liberty\\" Freeman (January 1973)online Spencer anticipated many of the analytical standpoints of later libertarian theorists such as Friedrich Hayek, especially in his \\"law of equal liberty\\", his insistence on the limits to predictive knowledge, his model of a spontaneous social order, and his warnings about the \\"unintended consequences\\" of collectivist social reforms.Chris Matthew Sciabarra, \\"Libertarianism\\", in International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology, ed. Jens Beckert and Milan Zafirovski (2006), pp. 403‚Äì07 online. While often caricatured as ultra-conservative, Spencer had been more radical earlier in his career ‚Äì opposing private property in land and claiming that each person has a latent claim to participate in the use of the earth (views that influenced Georgism), calling himself \\"a radical feminist\\" and advocating the organisation of trade unions as a bulwark against \\"exploitation by bosses\\", and favoured an economy organised primarily in free worker co- operatives as a replacement for wage-labor. Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s. He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to socialisation of the means of production, saying \\"all socialism is slavery\\"; Spencer defined a slave as a person who \\"labours under coercion to satisfy another's desires\\" and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and \\"it means not whether his master is a single person or society\\". =Social Darwinism= For many, the name of Herbert Spencer is virtually synonymous with social Darwinism, a social theory that applies the law of the survival of the fittest to society and is integrally related to the nineteenth century rise in scientific racism. In addition to Spencer's many positive contributions to intellectual thought, his contributions to racist ideology must also be acknowledged. In his famed work Social Statics (1850), he argued that imperialism had served civilization by clearing the inferior races off the earth: \\"The forces which are working out the great scheme of perfect happiness, taking no account of incidental suffering, exterminate such sections of mankind as stand in their way. ‚Ä¶ Be he human or be he brute ‚Äî the hindrance must be got rid of.‚Äù Yet, in the same work, Spencer goes on to say that the incidental evolutionary benefits derived from such barbarous practices do not serve as justifications for them going forward.Spencer, Social Statics, 417-19. Spencer's association with social Darwinism might have its origin in a specific interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result in the death of a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity. Focusing on the form as well as the content of Spencer's \\"Synthetic Philosophy\\", one writer has identified it as the paradigmatic case of \\"social Darwinism\\", understood as a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science. In a letter to the Japanese government regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that \\"if you mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neither‚Äîa constitution which will not work properly\\". He goes on to say that America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. He states \\"if they mix they must form a bad hybrid\\" regarding the issue of Chinese and (ethnically European) Americans. Spencer ends his letter with the following blanket statement against all immigration: \\"In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of European or American races with the Japanese.\\" General influence While most philosophers fail to achieve much of a following outside the academy of their professional peers, by the 1870s and 1880s Spencer had achieved an unparalleled popularity, as the sheer volume of his sales indicate. He was probably the first, and possibly the only, philosopher in history to sell over a million copies of his works during his own lifetime. In the United States, where pirated editions were still commonplace, his authorised publisher, Appleton, sold 368,755 copies between 1860 and 1903. This figure did not differ much from his sales in his native Britain, and once editions in the rest of the world are added in the figure of a million copies seems like a conservative estimate. As William James remarked, Spencer \\"enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally.\\" The aspect of his thought that emphasised individual self-improvement found a ready audience in the skilled working class. Spencer's influence among leaders of thought was also immense, though it was most often expressed in terms of their reaction to, and repudiation of, his ideas. As his American follower John Fiske observed, Spencer's ideas were to be found \\"running like the weft through all the warp\\" of Victorian thought.Quoted in John Offer, Herbert Spencer: Critical Assessments (London: Routledge, 2004), p. 612. Such varied thinkers as Henry Sidgwick, T.H. Green, G.E. Moore, William James, Henri Bergson, and √âmile Durkheim defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a very large extent an extended debate with Spencer, from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Hamilton, ca. 1895 In post-1863-Uprising Poland, many of Spencer's ideas became integral to the dominant fin-de-si√®cle ideology, \\"Polish Positivism\\". The leading Polish writer of the period, Boles≈Çaw Prus, hailed Spencer as \\"the Aristotle of the nineteenth century\\" and adopted Spencer's metaphor of society-as-organism, giving it a striking poetic presentation in his 1884 micro-story, \\"Mold of the Earth\\", and highlighting the concept in the introduction to his most universal novel, Pharaoh (1895). The early 20th century was hostile to Spencer. Soon after his death, his philosophical reputation went into a sharp decline. Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as a \\"parody of philosophy\\",Gertrude Himmelfarb, Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution, 1968, p. 222; quoted in Robert J. Richards, Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), p. 243. and the historian Richard Hofstadter called him \\"the metaphysician of the homemade intellectual, and the prophet of the cracker-barrel agnostic.\\"Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism in American Thought (1944; Boston: Beacon Press, 1992), p. 32. Nonetheless, Spencer's thought had penetrated so deeply into the Victorian age that his influence did not disappear entirely. In recent years, much more positive estimates have appeared,Mark Francis, Herbert Spencer and the Invention of Modern Life (Newcastle, UK: Acumen Publishing, 2007). as well as a still highly negative estimate.Stewart (2011). =Political influence= Despite his reputation as a social Darwinist, Spencer's political thought has been open to multiple interpretations. His political philosophy could both provide inspiration to those who believed that individuals were masters of their fate, who should brook no interference from a meddling state, and those who believed that social development required a strong central authority. In Lochner v. New York, conservative justices of the United States Supreme Court could find inspiration in Spencer's writings for striking down a New York law limiting the number of hours a baker could work during the week, on the ground that this law restricted liberty of contract. Arguing against the majority's holding that a \\"right to free contract\\" is implicit in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote: \\"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.\\" Spencer has also been described as a quasi-anarchist, as well as an outright anarchist. Marxist theorist Georgi Plekhanov, in his 1909 book Anarchism and Socialism, labelled Spencer a \\"conservative Anarchist.\\"Plekhanov, Georgiƒ≠ Valentinovich (1912), trans. Aveling, Eleanor Marx. Anarchism and Socialism, p. 143. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Company. (See here.) Spencer's ideas became very influential in China and Japan largely because he appealed to the reformers' desire to establish a strong nation-state with which to compete with the Western powers. His thought was introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who saw his writings as a prescription for the reform of the Qing state.Benjamin Schwartz, In Search of Wealth and Power (The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1964). Spencerism was so influential in China that it was synthesized into the Chinese translation of the Origin of Species, in which Darwin‚Äôs branching view of evolution was converted into a linear-progressive one. Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernizer Tokutomi Soho, who believed that Japan was on the verge of transitioning from a \\"militant society\\" to an \\"industrial society,\\" and needed to quickly jettison all things Japanese and take up Western ethics and learning.Kenneth Pyle, The New Generation in Meiji Japan (Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 1969). He also corresponded with Kaneko Kentaro, warning him of the dangers of imperialism.Spencer to Kaneko Kentaro, 26 August 1892 in The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer ed. David Duncan (1908), p. 296. Savarkar writes in his Inside the Enemy Camp, about reading all of Spencer's works, of his great interest in them, of their translation into Marathi, and their influence on the likes of Tilak and Agarkar, and the affectionate sobriquet given to him in Maharashtra ‚Äì Harbhat Pendse. =Influence on literature= Spencer greatly influenced literature and rhetoric. His 1852 essay, \\"The Philosophy of Style\\", explored a growing trend of formalist approaches to writing. Highly focused on the proper placement and ordering of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective composition. Spencer aimed to free prose writing from as much \\"friction and inertia\\" as possible, so that the reader would not be slowed by strenuous deliberations concerning the proper context and meaning of a sentence. Spencer argued that writers should aim \\"To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort\\" by the reader. He argued that by making the meaning as readily accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency. This was accomplished, according to Spencer, by placing all the subordinate clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence so that, when readers reached the subject, they had all the information they needed to completely perceive its significance. While the overall influence that \\"The Philosophy of Style\\" had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer's voice lent authoritative support to formalist views of rhetoric. Spencer influenced literature inasmuch as many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. Spencer was referenced by George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Machado de Assis, Thomas Hardy, Boles≈Çaw Prus, George Bernard Shaw, Abraham Cahan, Richard Austin Freeman, D. H. Lawrence, and Jorge Luis Borges. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, and the influence it had on Bennett may be seen in his many novels. Jack London went so far as to create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: \\"They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. Spencer says.\\" \\"I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.\\" \\"He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.\\" Upton Sinclair, in One Clear Call, 1948, quips that \\"Huxley said that Herbert Spencer's idea of a tragedy was a generalization killed by a fact; ...\\"Sinclair, Upton; One Clear Call; R. & R.

The traditional use has been for land surveying, but they are also used extensively for building and infrastructure construction, and some specialized applications such as meteorology and rocket launching. It consists of a moveable telescope mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical axes and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. These angles can be measured with accuracies down to microradians or seconds of arc. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a total station where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory. In a transit theodolite, the telescope is short enough to rotate through the zenith, otherwise for non-transit instruments vertical (or altitude), rotation is restricted to a limited arc. The optical level is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for levelling on a horizontal plane.  Principles of operation  The axes and circles of a theodolite Diagram of an optical readout theodolite =Preparation for making sightings= Temporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are achieved in four steps: * Setting up: fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. * Centering: bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over station mark using a centering plate also known as a tribrach. * Levelling: leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level. * Focusing: removing parallax error by proper focusing of objective and eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sightings from this station because of the different distances to the target. =Sightings= Sightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope's vertical and horizontal angular orientation so the cross-hairs align with the desired sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the position of the instrument and tripod. The earliest angular readouts were from open vernier scales directly visible to the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection, and finally became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern digital theodolites have electronic displays. = Errors in measurement = ; Index error: The angles in the vertical axis should read 90¬∞ (100 grad) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270¬∞ (300 grad) when the instrument is transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the index error. This can only be checked on transit instruments. ; Horizontal axis error: The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a horizontal axis error exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180¬∞). To adjust, the operator removes half the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine the adjustment. ; Collimation error: The optical axis of the telescope, must also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis. If not, then a collimation error exists. Index error, horizontal-axis error (trunnion-axis error) and collimation error are regularly determined by calibration and are removed by mechanical adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the theodolite.

Over time their functions were combined into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously. Sectioned Wild theodolite showing the complex light paths for optical readout, and the enclosed construction The first occurrence of the word \\"theodolite\\" is found in the surveying textbook A geometric practice named Pantometria (1571) by Leonard Digges. The origin of the word is unknown. The first part of the New Latin theo-delitus might stem from the Greek , \\"to behold or look attentively upon\\"Theaomai - Greek Lexicon The second part is often attributed to an unscholarly variation of the Greek word: , meaning \\"evident\\" or \\"clear\\", Other New-latin or Greek derivations have been suggested as well as an English origin from \\"the alidade\\" The early forerunners of the theodolite were sometimes azimuth instruments for measuring horizontal angles, while others had an altazimuth mount for measuring horizontal and vertical angles. Gregorius Reisch illustrated an altazimuth instrument in the appendix of his 1512 book Margarita Philosophica.Daumas, Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 . Martin Waldseem√ºller, a topographer and cartographer made the device in that year calling it the polimetrum.Mills, John FitzMaurice, Encyclopedia of Antique Scientific Instruments, Aurum Press, London, 1983, In Digges's book of 1571, the term \\"theodolite\\" was applied to an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only, but he also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth which he called a topographicall instrument .Turner, Gerard L'E., Elizabethan Instrument Makers: The Origins of the London Trade in Precision Instrument Making, Oxford University Press, 2000, Possibly the first instrument approximating to a true theodolite was the built by Joshua Habemel in 1576, complete with compass and tripod. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares \\"graphometer\\" to \\"half-theodolite\\".Cyclopaedia, vol. 2 p. 50 for \\"Semi-Circle\\" As late as the 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a simple theodolite and the altazimuth instrument, the plain theodolite. The first instrument to combine the essential features of the modern theodolite was built in 1725 by Jonathan Sisson. This instrument had an altazimuth mount with a sighting telescope. The base plate had spirit levels, compass and adjusting screws. The circles were read with a vernier scale. =Development of the theodolite= The theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the introduction of Jesse Ramsden's famous great theodolite, which he created using a very accurate dividing engine of his own design.Turner, Gerard L'E. Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments, Sotheby Publications, 1983, Ramsden's instruments were used for the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. At this time the highest precision instruments were made in England by such makers as Edward Troughton. Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 6-44 Later the first practical German theodolites were made by Breithaupt together with Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010, pp. 349‚Äì360. As technology progressed the vertical partial circle was replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were finely graduated. This was the transit theodolite. This type of theodolite was developed from 18th century astronomical Transit instruments used to measure accurate star positions. The technology was transferred to theodolites in the early 19th century by instrument makers such as Edward Troughton and William Simms and became the standard theodolite design. Development of the theodolite was spurred on by specific needs. In the 1820s progress on national surveying projects such as the Ordnance Survey in Britain produced a requirement for theodolites capable of providing sufficient accuracy for large scale triangulation and mapping. The Survey of India at this time produced a requirement for more rugged and stable instruments such as the Everest pattern theodolite with its lower centre of gravity. Railway engineers working in the 1830s in Britain commonly referred to a theodolite as a \\"Transit\\". The 1840s was the start of a period of rapid railway building in many parts of the world which resulted in a high demand for theodolites wherever railways were being constructed.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 123-125 It was also popular with American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the railroad compass, sextant and octant. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by Edward Samuel Ritchie.American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. XXIII, May 1895 ‚Äì May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896), pp. 359‚Äì360 It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.American Academy, pp. 359‚Äì360 In the early 1920s a step change in theodolite design occurred with the introduction of the Wild T2 made by Wild Heerbrugg. Heinrich Wild designed a theodolite with divided glass circles with readings from both sides presented at a single eyepiece close to the telescope so the observer did not have to move to read them. The Wild instruments were not only smaller, easier to use and more accurate than contemporary rivals but also sealed from rain and dust. Canadian surveyors reported that while the Wild T2 with 3.75 inch circles was not able to provide the accuracy for primary triangulation it was the equal in accuracy to a 12 inch traditional design.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 79-80 The Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made for many years. In 1926 a conference was held at Tavistock in Devon, UK where Wild theodolites were compared with British ones. The Wild product outclassed the British theodolites so manufacturers such as Cooke, Troughton & Simms and Hilger & Watts set about improving the accuracy of their products to match their competition. Cooke, Troughton and Simms developed the Tavistock pattern theodolite and later the Vickers V. 22.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 80-82 Wild went on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today. By 1977 Wild, Kern and Hewlett-Packard were all offering \\"Total stations\\" which combined angular measurements, electronic distance measurement and microchip functions in a single unit. = Operation in surveying = U.S. National Geodetic Survey technicians observing with a 0.2 arcsecond (‚âà 0.001 mrad or 1 ¬µrad) resolution Wild T3 theodolite mounted on an observing stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party (c. 1950). Triangulation, as invented by Gemma Frisius around 1533, consists of making such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical representation. Modern triangulation as, e.g., practised by Snellius, is the same procedure executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant. In the late 1780s, Jesse Ramsden, a Yorkshireman from Halifax, England who had developed the dividing engine for dividing angular scales accurately to within a second of arc (‚âà 0.0048 mrad or 4.8 ¬µrad), was commissioned to build a new instrument for the British Ordnance Survey. The Ramsden theodolite was used over the next few years to map the whole of southern Britain by triangulation. In network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimeter precision. Nowadays GPS antennas used for geodetic positioning use a similar mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodolite‚Äîor the target‚Äîabove the ground benchmark must be measured precisely. =Transit theodolite= The term transit theodolite, or transit for short, refers to a type of theodolite where the telescope is short enough to rotate in a full circle on its horizontal axis as well as around its vertical axis. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could \\"flip over\\" (\\"transit the scope\\"). By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be used in 'plate-left' or 'plate- right' modes ('plate' refers to the vertical protractor circle). By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (‚âà 0.15 mrad). Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with light-emitting diodes and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy up to arc-second (‚âà 0.005 mrad) levels.  Use with weather balloons  There is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called ceiling balloons or pilot balloons (pibal). Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward. The pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the operator's eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite, and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent, azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and direction at various altitudes.  Modern electronic theodolites  A typical modern electronic theodolite: Nikon DTM-520 In modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical circles is usually done with a rotary encoder. These produce signals indicating the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor. CCD sensors have been added to the focal plane of the telescope allowing both auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset. All this is implemented in embedded software of the processor. Many modern theodolites are equipped with integrated electro-optical distance measuring devices, generally infrared based, allowing the measurement in one step of complete three-dimensional vectors‚Äîalbeit in instrument-defined polar coordinates, which can then be transformed to a pre-existing coordinate system in the area by means of a sufficient number of control points. This technique is called a resection solution or free station position surveying and is widely used in mapping surveying. Such instruments are \\"intelligent\\" theodolites called self- registering tacheometers or colloquially \\"total stations\\", and perform all the necessary angular and distance calculations, and the results or raw data can be downloaded to external processors, such as ruggedized laptops, PDAs or programmable calculators  Gyrotheodolites  A gyrotheodolite is used when the north-south reference bearing of the meridian is required in the absence of astronomical star sights. This occurs mainly in the underground mining industry and in tunnel engineering. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyrotheodolite can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. Unlike an artificial horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyrotheodolite cannot be relocated while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site. The gyrotheodolite comprises a normal theodolite with an attachment that contains a gyrocompass, a device which senses the rotation of the Earth in order to find true north and thus, in conjunction with the direction of gravity, the plane of the meridian. The meridian is the plane that contains both the axis of the Earth's rotation and the observer. The intersection of the meridian plane with the horizontal defines the true north-south direction found in this way. Unlike magnetic compasses, gyrocompasses are able to find true north, the surface direction toward the north pole. A gyrotheodolite will function at the equator and in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The meridian is undefined at the geographic poles. A gyrotheodolite cannot be used at the poles where the Earth's axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner, indeed it is not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole where the angle between the earth's rotation and the direction of gravity is too small for it to work reliably. When available, astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than one hundred times the accuracy of the gyrotheodolite. Where this extra precision is not required, the gyrotheodolite is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.

The chain was started in 1971 in Brooklyn, New York, by businessmen Eddie and Sam M. Antar, and was previously named ERS Electronics (ERS stood for Eddie, Rose and Sam; Rose and Sam were Eddie's parents). The chain rose to prominence throughout the Tri-State Region as much for its prices as for its memorable radio and television commercials, featuring a frenetic, \\"crazy\\" character played by radio DJ Jerry Carroll (who copied most of his shtick from early TV-commercial pioneer, used car and electronics salesman Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz). At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in four states and reported more than $300 million in sales. Unable to sustain his fraudulent business practices, co-founder Eddie Antar cashed in millions of dollars' worth of stock and resigned from the company in December 1986. Crazy Eddie's board of directors approved the sale of the company in November 1987. The entire Antar family was immediately removed from the business. The new owners quickly discovered the true extent of the Antar family's fraud, but were unable to turn around Crazy Eddie's quickly declining fortunes. In 1989, the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. In February 1987, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey commenced a federal grand jury investigation into the financial activities of Crazy Eddie. In September of that year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into alleged violations of federal securities laws by certain Crazy Eddie officers and employees. Eddie Antar was eventually charged with a series of crimes. Antar fled to Israel in February 1990, but was returned to the United States in January 1993 to stand trial. His 1993 conviction on fraud charges was overturned, but he eventually pleaded guilty in 1996. In 1997, Antar was sentenced to eight years in prison and was subject to numerous fines. He was released from prison in 1999. Beginnings Eddie Antar's grandparents, Murad and Tera Antar, who were Syrian Jews, relocated to Brooklyn, New York from Aleppo, Syria. Murad and Tera worked in their market stalls alongside Arabs, including Egyptians, other Syrians, as well as Turks. Eddie's father Sam Antar was a retailer, and it was no surprise to the family that Eddie also became a retailer.Wells, Joseph T. Frankensteins of Fraud: The 20th Century's Top Ten White-Collar Criminals. Obsidian Pub. Co., 2000; The predecessor to Crazy Eddie was a consumer electronics shop called Sight And Sound. It was a property of ERS Electronics, a company owned by Sam M. Antar, his son Eddie Antar, and Eddie's cousin Ronnie Gindi. Sight And Sound, located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn, began operation in 1969 and offered electronics at regular prices. Due to his aggressive sales techniques, Eddie quickly became known as \\"Crazy Eddie\\", but within eighteen months the shop (as well as Eddie and Ronnie) was nearly bankrupt. Eddie bought out Gindi's one-third ownership stake of Sight And Sound, and Sam M. Antar retained his one-third stake but left the day-to-day operations to Eddie. In 1971, the Sight And Sound store on Kings Highway was renamed Crazy Eddie. Eddie continued his sales tactics with the renamed Crazy Eddie shop, but this time was successful. Eventually, Eddie closed that location and relocated the business to a bigger shop, just a few blocks from Sight And Sound's old location. In 1973, Antar opened the second Crazy Eddie location in Syosset, New York. A third followed during 1975, located in Manhattan. That year, Antar established a corporate main office in Brooklyn, New York. By 1977, two more stores had been opened, with one located on East Fordham Road in The Bronx and the other being the first Crazy Eddie location in New Jersey, located on the southbound side of Route 17 in Paramus. Advertising Former New York radio DJ Jerry Carroll appeared in more than 7,500 commercials as a Crazy Eddie pitchman. Antar bought advertising space on New York radio station WPIX-FM. In 1972, a live commercial was performed by DJ \\"Dr. Jerry\\" Carroll, who ended the scene by reading the shop's slogan, \\"his prices are insane\\", in this manner: \\"Crazy Eddie, his prices are IN-SA-A-A-A-A-ANE!\\". Antar telephoned and told Carroll to say the line the same way every time, and thus a working relationship had begun. Beginning in 1975, Carroll began television advertisement. For most of the next fifteen years Carroll performed commercials in the same frenetic manner he had for radio. One of his more memorable promotions was for Crazy Eddie's annual \\"Christmas in August\\" sale, where he would dress in a Santa suit and do the commercial while stagehands threw fake snowballs at him. Carroll also had a trademark look in each commercial, wearing a blue suit with a lighter blue turtleneck shirt in almost all of his appearances (even during later years). Carroll even appeared in a Spanish-language Crazy Eddie advertisement, although he did not have a speaking role; instead, his appearance consisted of him holding a radio to his ear as he walked behind the commercial's spokesman, stopping only to wave at the camera several times. During the 1980s, more than 7,500 unique radio and television ads were broadcast in the tri-state area. Carroll's acting became so identified with the company that many people thought he was actually Crazy Eddie; Crazy Eddie even made a commercial to this effect with Carroll as a Superman-styled superhero named Crazy Eddie. Warner Communications, the parent company of the distributor of the Superman movie series, found the commercial to be problematic and sued the chain trying to stop it. At the time, Warner also was the parent company of the Atari video game company, and its largest customer for systems and games was Crazy Eddie. Therefore, in retaliation for the lawsuit, Eddie said that if Warner was going to sue for the commercial, he would stop selling Atari products in his stores. The suit was eventually settled. The commercials were so memorable that HBO's news parody series Not Necessarily the News created a parody television commercial featuring a caricature of Oliver North (from the infamous Iran‚ÄìContra affair), known as \\"Crazy Ollie\\", selling used weapons at bargain prices. An early Eddie's commercial parody appeared on NBC's Saturday Night Live on January 22, 1977 in the Dan Aykroyd creation, \\"Crazy Ernie\\". Carroll and the commercials became significantly cultural during the 1980s, with the commercials sometimes appearing in the background of contemporary motion pictures. An example is the frightening first sight of a television receiver with a typical Jerry Carroll commercial on screen by Daryl Hannah's mermaid character in Ron Howard's 1984 comedy Splash. Crazy Eddie also was known to have in-store appearances by notable rock acts, including all four members of Queen in their Manhattan location on Tuesday, July 27, 1982 (prior to their performance that evening at Madison Square Garden). Fraud Almost from the beginning, Crazy Eddie's management engaged in various forms of fraud. The Antars deliberately falsified their books to reduce (or eliminate) their taxable income. They also paid employees off the books, and regularly skimmed thousands of dollars (in cash) earned at the shops. For every $5 Crazy Eddie reported as income, $1 was taken by the Antars. In 1979, the Antars began depositing much of this money‚Äîhundreds of thousands of dollars‚Äîin Israeli bank accounts. The Antar family skimmed an estimated $3 to $4 million per year at the height of their fraud. In one offshore bank account, the family deposited more than $6 million between 1980 and 1983. By 1983, it was becoming more and more difficult to hide the millions of illicit dollars. The Antars decided that the way to cover up their growing fraud was to take the company public. In preparation, Eddie initiated a scheme in 1979 to skim less each year. Since more income was actually being reported, this had the effect of showing drastically increasing profit margins. While the company's actual profits (taking into account skimmed profits) from 1980 to 1983 increased approximately 13%, reported profits increased nearly 171%. Despite the misgivings of people closely associated with Crazy Eddie, the company held its initial public offering on September 13, 1984 (former symbol: CRZY). Shares of the company sold initially for $8. By early 1986, Crazy Eddie stock was trading at more than $75 per share (split adjusted).https://whitecollarfraud.com/crazy-eddie/crazy-eddie- saga-table-of-contents/ Eddie recruited his cousin, Sam E. Antar (known as Sammy), to assist the company with its fraud. Sammy earned a degree in accounting in 1980, and served his apprenticeship with Penn and Horowitz, Crazy Eddie's auditor. In 1986, he was named chief financial officer of the company. Sammy was informed that there was a $3 million deficit from the previous year's inventory fraud that needed to be hidden. Additionally, he was instructed to find ways to show a 10% growth in sales. One of Sammy's major schemes was a money laundering operation later known as the Panama Pump‚Äîmoney that the Antars had deposited in Israeli banks was transferred to bank accounts in Panama. These accounts, opened using false names, then drafted payments to Crazy Eddie. This money was largely used to inflate same-store sales totals for the company. As a public company, Eddie, Sammy, and others engaged in increasing amounts of inventory fraud to increase reported profits and inflate the value of Crazy Eddie stock. For the fiscal year ended March 1, 1985, Crazy Eddie falsified inventories by $3 million. The next fiscal year, that amount increased to between $10 and $12 million. =Collapse= Only months after Crazy Eddie's IPO, Eddie started arguing with his wife and former high school sweetheart, Debbie. He began having an affair with another, younger woman, also named Debbie. They were caught by Eddie's wife and sister on New Year's Eve 1984. Crazy Eddie's troubles began almost immediately afterward; the scam had relied extensively on family members helping keep the appearance that it was an immensely successful company. By 1987, Sammy's goal was no longer to show greater profitability, but rather to disguise previous frauds. During fiscal year 1987, they falsified inventories between $22.5 and $28 million. In addition, Crazy Eddie booked $20 million in phony debit memos or charge backs to vendors that reduced accounts payable. As the company's fraud became more difficult to disguise, the public perception of Crazy Eddie as a commercial success began to change. By October 1986, the company's stock value had decreased to $17.50 per share. During December, Eddie announced his resignation as president and CEO. In April 1987, it was announced that Eddie had in fact retained his role as president but had dismissed, among others, his father Sam M. Antar. But by then Eddie had already cashed out his share of Crazy Eddie stock, worth between $25 million and $30 million. By the spring of 1987, the company's stock cost less than $10 a share. Additionally, earnings decreased 20% from the previous year. The franchise did show a 34% sales increase, but this was mainly the result of 13 new store openings. In May 1987, Eddie began proceedings to make the company a privately held company again. Before that could happen, Houston-based businessman Elias Zinn and management consultant Victor Palmieri initiated a hostile takeover. With Palmieri's backing, Zinn purchased $17.5 million worth of Crazy Eddie stock, which represented 7.5% of the outstanding shares. Once rumors of a takeover started, financial analysts began to examine more closely Crazy Eddie's financial situation. What they discovered was that while most stockholders of the company had lost money since 1984, Eddie had sold 6.5 million shares worth $74 million. A flurry of stockholder lawsuits were filed against the Antar family. Eddie and Sammy briefly attempted to counter-offer Zinn's takeover, but Zinn quickly topped their funds. The Antars' bid was ended, and Zinn became the new owner of Crazy Eddie on November 6, 1987. He immediately dismissed the rest of the Antar family from any important jobs. When Palmieri's financial analysts completed their preliminary audit a few weeks after the takeover, they estimated that Crazy Eddie's inventory was short by $40 to $50 million. The final figure was $80 million. By June 1988, Crazy Eddie's suppliers were demanding the liquidation of the company, so they could recover money owed to them; in 1989 they got their wish. The closing of Crazy Eddie began in March 1989, as the company shuttered 17 of its 43 stores. On June 6, 1989, Crazy Eddie was served with a petition by five of its creditors, who had not been paid a total of $860,000 they were owed, which sought to have the company forced into bankruptcy. The company originally planned to fight the petition and file for dismissal, but 15 days later Crazy Eddie voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Company president and CEO Peter Martosella cited problems created by the creditors' position (which he termed \\"ill-advised\\"), but said business would be conducted as usual at the remaining 26 stores and that Crazy Eddie was still a strong franchise. The company vowed to stay in business but despite Martosella's assertions Crazy Eddie continued to falter. By the autumn of 1989, sales were continuing to decrease and stores were unable to keep items stocked due to lack of supplier interest in the company. Faced with these facts, Crazy Eddie management decided that the chain was not worth saving. Soon after Crazy Eddie began going-out-of-business sales, but store supply remained minimal even when leftover merchandise from stores that had shuttered was sent to others that were still in operation. By the end of 1989 the remaining 26 Crazy Eddie locations closed and the chain ceased to exist. During a period of three years, Crazy Eddie had gone from one of the most lucrative retailers in the United States, trading at $75 per share, to bankruptcy and liquidation. =Legal battles= In the meantime, a longtime Crazy Eddie associate named Arnie Spindler, who quit the company after Eddie dismissed his father Sam, brothers Allen and Mitchell and others after a family dispute, had provided investigators with information concerning Crazy Eddie's fraudulent business practices. Spindler implicated Eddie and Sammy, but stated the rest of the family was innocent, though subpoenas were served to the entire Antar family. Based on information gathered during its investigation, the SEC charged Eddie Antar with securities fraud and illegal insider trading on September 6, 1989. In January 1990, a Federal district judge ordered Antar to repatriate more than $50 million he had transferred illegally to Israel. He was also ordered to appear in court to explain what had happened with the money. When he failed to appear, an arrest warrant was issued. Eddie surrendered to U.S. Marshals a week later, but was released and ordered to appear at a second hearing. When he failed to appear at that hearing, a second arrest warrant was issued and his assets were frozen. February 27, 1990 arrest warrant for Eddie Antar Eddie fled to Israel using a fake passport and the alias David Jacob Levi Cohen, and purchased a townhouse in the city of Yavne. After Eddie fled the country, Sammy offered to testify for Federal prosecutors in exchange for immunity. Sammy pleaded guilty to three felonies. He avoided jail time in exchange for his testimony, however, and was instead sentenced to six months of house arrest, 1,200 hours of community service, three years of probation, and was levied more than $10,000 in fines. As of 2009, Sammy was an adviser for government agencies and businesses investigating fraud. Eddie was arrested in June 1992 on federal racketeering conspiracy charges and was extradited to the United States in January 1993. He pleaded not guilty and his trial began in June 1993, and was prosecuted jointly by U.S. Attorneys Paul Weissman and Michael Chertoff. On July 20, Eddie was found guilty of seventeen counts of fraud. His brother, Mitchell, was found guilty of three counts, and acquitted on two. Eddie was sentenced to 12¬Ω years in prison. The Antars' lawyers immediately filed an appeal, citing what they believed was bias on the part of the presiding judge. In April 1995, the verdicts against Eddie and Mitchell were overturned by a Federal appeals panel. Chertoff, calling Eddie \\"the Darth Vader of capitalism\\", vowed to begin a new trial. Eddie Antar eventually pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in May 1996. In February 1997, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was also ordered to pay more than $150 million in fines, in addition to the more than $1 billion in judgments against him resulting from various civil suits. Efforts to recover additional money from the Antar family on behalf of defrauded stockholders were completed in 2012. Revival attempts Soon after the chain closed in 1989, a New Jersey-based investment group led by Alex Adjimi bought the rights to the Crazy Eddie trademark and announced in January 1990 that it had purchased the leases on Crazy Eddie's Brooklyn flagship store and another in East Brunswick, New Jersey. The intent of Adjimi's group was to reopen the chain, but nothing ever came of the attempt. In 1998, the grandchildren of Eddie, Allen and Mitchell Antar, revived the chain with a shop in Wayne, New Jersey, and as an online Internet venture, crazyeddieonline.com. The revived company retained the slogan \\"His prices are insane\\" and re-hired Jerry Carroll, who by this time had founded his own advertising agency, as spokesman. Despite plans to expand the chain to a potential 10 stores, the new Crazy Eddie did not expand beyond the Wayne store and in 1999 the only shop of the revived chain closed. Eddie returned to the company in 2001, which by this time had been doing business solely as an Internet and buy-by-telephone business for more than a year. He reinitiated the Web site as crazyeddie.com and once again hired Jerry Carroll to do its advertising. By 2004 crazyeddie.com had disappeared again, and after a brief attempt to revive the online retailer in 2005 Crazy Eddie ceased to exist once again. The Crazy Eddie trademark and associated intellectual property were then acquired by Texas-based company Trident Growth Fund. In July 2006, Trident attempted to auction the brand and the domain name crazyeddie.com on eBay, but the reserve price was not met. On March 3, 2009, it was announced that Brooklyn-based businessman Jack Gemal had bought the rights to the Crazy Eddie name and quickly began a new online Crazy Eddie venture at pricesareinsane.com. Gemal was also reported to be scouting retail space for new Crazy Eddie retail locations, stating that he wanted to open 50 locations during the next two years. This online venture performed business in the same manner as Crazy Eddie's other online stores, selling appliances and other electronics through the Internet. However, Gemal was never able to find the retail space he sought to reinitiate the Crazy Eddie store chain, and in 2012 the online business ended. The pricesareinsane.com site no longer exists, and as of 2018 the Crazy Eddie trademark is listed as abandoned. Death of Eddie Antar On September 10, 2016, Eddie Antar died at the age of 68.

The three children were L√∫cia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto. Bishop Jos√© Alves Correia da Silva declared the events worthy of belief on 13 October 1930. On 13 May 1946, Pope Pius XII granted a canonical coronation to the venerated image enshrined at the Chapel of the Apparitions of F√°tima via his apostolic legate, Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella. On 11 November 1954, he raised the Sanctuary of F√°tima to the status of a minor basilica by his papal brief Lucer superna. The published memoirs of L√∫cia dos Santos in the 1930s revealed two secrets that she claimed came from the Virgin while the third secret was to be revealed by the Catholic Church in 1960. The controversial events at F√°tima gained fame due partly to elements of the secrets, prophecy and eschatological revelations allegedly related to the Second World War and possibly more global wars in the future, particularly the Virgin's alleged request for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. History =Prelude= Monument of the Guardian Angel of Portugal. In the spring and summer of 1916, nine-year-old L√∫cia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto were herding sheep at the Cova da Iria near their home village of Aljustrel in the parish of F√°tima, Portugal. They later said they were visited three times by an apparition of an angel. They said the angel, who identified himself as the \\"Angel of Peace\\" and \\"Guardian Angel of Portugal\\", taught them prayers, to make sacrifices, and to spend time in adoration of the Lord.\\"Apparitions of the Angel,\\" F√°tima, EWTN =Marian apparitions= Beginning in the spring of 1917, the children reported apparitions of an Angel, and starting in May 1917, apparitions of the Virgin Mary, whom the children described as \\"the Lady more brilliant than the Sun\\". The children reported a prophecy that prayer would lead to an end to the Great War, and that on 13 October that year the Lady would reveal her identity and perform a miracle \\"so that all may believe.\\"De Marchi 1952:118 Newspapers reported the prophecies, and many pilgrims began visiting the area. The children's accounts were deeply controversial, drawing intense criticism from both local secular and religious authorities. A provincial administrator briefly took the children into custody, believing the prophecies were politically motivated in opposition to the officially secular First Portuguese Republic established in 1910.Bennett, 2012 The events of 13 October became known as the Miracle of the Sun. Statue dedicated to the apparition. On 13 May 1917, the children reported seeing a woman \\"brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun.\\" The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray \\"the Rosary every day, to bring peace to the world and an end to the war\\". While the children had never told anyone about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. L√∫cia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private. Jacinta's disbelieving mother told neighbors about it as a joke, and within a day the whole village knew of the children's vision.De Marchi, John. The Immaculate Heart, New York: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1952 L√∫cia dos Santos (left) with her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, 1917 The children said the woman told them to return to the Cova da Iria on 13 June 1917. L√∫cia's mother sought counsel from the parish priest, Father Ferreira, who suggested she allow them to go. He asked to have L√∫cia brought to him afterward so that he could question her. The second appearance occurred on 13 June, the feast of Saint Anthony, patron of the local parish church. On this occasion the lady revealed that Francisco and Jacinta would be taken to Heaven soon, but L√∫cia would live longer in order to spread her message and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. During the June visit, the children said the lady told them to say the Holy Rosary daily in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary to obtain peace and the end of the Great War. (Three weeks earlier, on 21 April, the first contingent of Portuguese soldiers had embarked for the front lines of the war.) The lady also purportedly revealed to the children a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as \\"good for some and bad for others\\". Fr. Ferreira later stated that L√∫cia recounted that the lady told her, \\"I want you to come back on the thirteenth and to learn to read in order to understand what I want of you. ...I don't want more.\\"Santu√°rio de F√°tima, 1992, 12 The Parish Church of F√°tima where the three children who saw the apparition were baptized. In the following months, thousands of people flocked to F√°tima and nearby Aljustrel, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. On 13 August 1917, the provincial administrator Artur SantosJaki, Stanley. God and the Sun at F√°tima (1999) Real View Books, Michigan, p. 15. (no relation to L√∫cia dos Santos) intervened, as he believed that these events were politically disruptive in the conservative country. He took the children into custody, jailing them before they could reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogated and threatened the children to get them to divulge the contents of the secrets. L√∫cia's mother hoped the officials could persuade the children to end the affair and admit that they had lied. L√∫cia told Santos everything short of the secrets, and offered to ask the woman for permission to tell the official the secrets. That month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on 13 August, the children reported that they saw the Virgin Mary on 19 August, a Sunday, at nearby Valinhos. She asked them again to pray the rosary daily, spoke about the miracle coming in October, and asked them \\"to pray a lot, a lot for the sinners and sacrifice a lot, as many souls perish in hell because nobody is praying or making sacrifices for them.\\" The three children claimed to have seen the Blessed Virgin Mary in a total of six apparitions between 13 May and 13 October 1917. L√∫cia also reported a seventh Marian apparition at Cova da Iria. 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the apparitions. =Miracle of the Sun= Page from Ilustra√ß√£o Portuguesa, 29 October 1917, showing the people looking at the Sun during the F√°tima apparitions attributed to the Virgin Mary After some newspapers reported that the Virgin Mary had promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions on 13 October, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathered at Cova da Iria. What happened then became known as the \\"Miracle of the Sun\\". Various claims have been made as to what actually happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of F√°tima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people.De Marchi 1952b:151‚Äì166 Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God.De Marchi, John. True Story of Fatima, Catechetical Guild Educational Society, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1956 According to accounts, after a period of rain, the dark clouds broke and the Sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun was then reported to have careened towards the Earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became \\"suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling\\".De Marchi 1952b:150 Not all witnesses reported seeing the Sun \\"dance\\". Some people only saw the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, saw nothing at all. Names Izabel Brandao de Melo, and a few vague or unverifiable accounts. The only known picture of the Sun taken during the event does not show anything unusual. No unusual phenomenon of the Sun was observed by scientists at the time. A number of theologians, scientists, and skeptics have offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, and optical effects caused by natural meteorological phenomena. Later years of the children L√∫cia dos Santos (standing) with her cousin, Jacinta Marto, 1917 Francisco and Jacinta Marto died in the international flu pandemic that began in 1918 and swept the world for two years. Francisco Marto died at home on 4 April 1919, at the age of ten. Jacinta died at the age of nine in Queen Stephanie's Children's Hospital in Lisbon on 20 February 1920. They are buried at the Sanctuary of F√°tima. They were beatified by Pope John Paul II on 13 May 2000 and canonized by Pope Francis on 13 May 2017.Announcement of forthcoming canonization of two Fatima visionaries Their mother Ol√≠mpia Marto said that her children predicted their deaths many times to her and to curious pilgrims in the brief period of time after the Marian apparitions.DeMarchi, John. True Story of F√°tima, 1952. At the age of fourteen, in 1922 L√∫cia was sent to the school of the Sisters of St. Dorothy (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of Porto, Portugal. In 1928 she became a postulant at the convent of the Sisters of St. Dorothy in Tui, Spain, near the border with Portugal. L√∫cia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time she said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturdays Devotion. She said that a subsequent vision of Christ as a child reiterated this request. In 1929, L√∫cia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the Consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. She also reported an apparition in Rianxo, Galicia, in 1931, in which she said that Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and delivered a message to give to the church's hierarchy. In 1936 and again in 1941, Sister L√∫cia said that the Virgin Mary had predicted the deaths of her two cousins during the second apparition on 13 June 1917. According to L√∫cia's 1941 account, on 13 June, L√∫cia asked the Virgin if the three children would go to heaven when they died. She said that she heard Mary reply, \\"Yes, I shall take Francisco and Jacinta soon, but you will remain a little longer, since Jesus wishes you to make me known and loved on Earth. He wishes also for you to establish devotion in the world to my Immaculate Heart.\\" In 1947, Sister L√∫cia left the Dorothean order. She joined the Discalced Carmelite Order in a monastery in Coimbra, Portugal. L√∫cia died on 13 February 2005, at the age of 97.

Image of Our Lady of F√°tima in the Chapel of the Apparitions. The widely reported miracle of the Sun contributed to F√°tima quickly becoming a major centre of pilgrimage. Two million pilgrims visited the site in the decade following the events of 1917.Ian Bradley, Pilgrimage: A Spiritual and Cultural Journey, Lion Hudson (2009), p. 68 A small chapel ‚Äì the Capelinha ‚Äì was built by local people on the site of the apparitions. The construction was neither encouraged nor hindered by the Catholic Church authorities. On 13 May 1920, pilgrims defied government troops to install a statue of the Virgin Mary in the chapel. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was first officially celebrated there in January 1924. A hostel for the sick was begun in that year. In 1927 the first rector of the sanctuary was appointed, and a set of Stations of the Cross were erected on the mountain road. The foundation stone for the present basilica was laid the next year.Leo Madigan, A Pilgrim's Handbook to F√°tima, Gracewing Publishing, 2001 pp. 20‚Äì24 In 1930 the Catholic Church officially recognised the apparition events as \\"worthy of belief\\" and granted a papal indulgence to pilgrims visiting F√°tima. In 1935 the bodies of the child visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta, were reinterred in the basilica. Pope Pius XII granted a Canonical Coronation of the statue of Our Lady of F√°tima on 13 May 1946. This event drew such large crowds that the entrance to the site had to be barred.Madigan, A Pilgrim's Handbook to F√°tima, 2001, p. 24 In the 21st century, pilgrimage to the site takes place year round. Additional chapels, hospitals and other facilities have been constructed at the site. The principal pilgrimage festivals take place on the thirteenth day of each month, from May to October, on the anniversaries of the original apparitions. The largest crowds gather on 13 May and 13 October, when up to a million pilgrims have attended to pray and witness processions of the statue of Our Lady of F√°tima, both during the day and by the light of tens of thousands of candles at night. Official position of the Catholic Church The reported visions at F√°tima gathered widespread attention, as numerous pilgrims began to visit the site. After a canonical inquiry, the Bishop of Leiria-F√°tima officially declared the visions of F√°tima as \\"worthy of belief\\" in October 1930, officially permitting the belief of Our Lady of F√°tima.\\"In virtue of considerations made known, and others which for reason of brevity we omit; humbly invoking the Divine Spirit and placing ourselves under the protection of the most Holy Virgin, and after hearing the opinions of our Rev. Advisors in this diocese, we hereby: 1) Declare worthy of belief, the visions of the shepherd children in the Cova da Iria, parish of F√°tima, in this diocese, from 13 May to 13 October 1917. 2) Permit officially the belief of Our Lady of F√°tima.\\", Bishop of Leiria-F√°tima, 13 October 1930. Political aspects At the time of the apparitions, Portugal was undergoing tensions between the secularizing Republican government and more conservative elements in society. The First Republic had begun with the revolution of 1910 overthrowing the constitutional monarch. It was intensely anticlerical and provoked a strong conservative reaction, ultimately leading to the military coup of 1926. Later in Spain during the 1920s and 1930s, as the forces of the Republic gathered strength, armies of faithful Roman Catholics carried images of the Virgin Mary, as protest and protection against groups they called godless. During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary were seen on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked the palms of her hands with a sword. Seers gained much credence in Integrist and Carlist circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Catholic Church actively encouraged the F√°tima devotion as a way of countering the perceived threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the adoration of F√°tima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted this in terms of the F√°tima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled. The original apparitions took place during the six months preceding the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and the children related that the Lady talked to them about the need to pray for Russia. L√∫cia admitted later that the children initially thought she was requesting prayers for a girl named Russia. In the first edition of Sister L√∫cia's memoirs, published after the outbreak of World War II, she focused on the issue of Russia. The warning by the Lady that \\"if Russia was not consecrated to God, it would spread errors throughout the world\\" was often seized upon as an anti-communist rallying cry. The Blue Army of Our Lady of F√°tima, for instance, has always been strongly anti-Communist and its members often associated the F√°tima story in the context of the Cold War. The Blue Army is made up of Catholics and non- Catholics who believe that by dedicating themselves to daily prayer (specifically, of the Rosary), they can help to achieve world peace and put an end to the error of communism. Organizations such as the Blue Army (nowadays known as the World Apostolate of F√°tima) have gained the approval of the Catholic Church. Memoirs of Sister L√∫cia Statue depicting the Immaculate Heart of Mary as described by Sister L√∫cia. The F√°tima story developed in two parts: that which was reported in 1917, and information later mentioned in Sister L√∫cia's memoirs which she wrote years later, after the Church ruled that the events in F√°tima were \\"worthy of belief.\\" Her memoir was not subject to the same scrutiny. The early messages focused on the need to pray the rosary for peace and an end to World War I. The alleged supernatural events in F√°tima were not widely known outside Portugal and Spain until L√∫cia published her memoirs, starting in the late 1930s. Between 1935 and 1993, she wrote six memoirs. The first four, written between 1935 and 1941 during World War II, were published under the title Fatima in Lucia's Own Words (1976). The fifth and six memoirs, written in 1989 and 1993, are published as Fatima in Lucia's Own Words II. In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged L√∫cia (at that time named Sister Maria L√∫cia das Dores) to write her memoirs, so that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her first memoir, published in 1935, focused on the holiness of Jacinta Marto. The deceased girl was by then popularly considered a saint. In her second memoir, published in 1937, Lucia wrote more about her own life, the apparition of 13 June 1917, and first reveals the earlier apparitions of the Angel of Peace. Finding herself inundated with constantly repeated questions concerning the Marian apparitions occurred in F√°tima, Portugal, and the visionaries, the message they received and the reason for some of the requests contained in that message, and feeling that it was beyond her to reply individually to each questioner, Sister L√∫cia asked the Holy See for permission to write a text in which she could reply in general to the many questions that had been put to her. This permission was granted and a new book was published entitled Calls from the Message of Fatima. =Three Secrets of F√°tima= In her third memoir of 1941, Sister L√∫cia described three secrets. She said these had been entrusted to the children during the apparition of 13 July 1917. First secret This was a vision of hell, which L√∫cia said they experienced on 13 July 1917.L√∫cia de Jesus, F√°tima In L√∫cia's Own words (1995), The Ravengate Press, pp. 101, 104 Second secret This was a recommendation for devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary as a way to save souls and bring peace to the world. It predicted an end to the Great War, but predicted a worse one if people did not cease offending God. This second war would be presaged by a night illuminated by an unknown light, as a \\"great sign\\" that the time of chastisement was near. To avert this, Mary would return to ask for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart, and the establishment of the First Saturdays Devotion. If her requests were heeded, Russia would be converted, and there would be peace; if not, Russia would spread her errorsRyan, Maurice (1993), \\"Fatima, Lourdes, and Medjugorje: A Challenge for Religious Educators\\", Religious Education, 88 (4): 564‚Äì575 throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The vision culminated with a promise that in the end, \\"the Immaculate Heart would triumph. The Holy Father would consecrate Russia to Mary, and a period of peace would be granted to the world.\\"L√∫cia de Jesus, F√°tima In L√∫cia's Own Words (1995), The Ravengate Press, p. 104 On 25 January 1938 (during solar cycle 17), bright lights, an aurora borealis appeared over the northern hemisphere, including in places as far south as North Africa, Bermuda and California. It was the widest occurrence of the aurora since 1709 and people in Paris and elsewhere believed a great fire was burning and notified fire departments. Sister L√∫cia indicated that it was the sign foretold and so apprised her superior and the bishop in letters the following day. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.Hessaman, Michael The F√°tima Secret, Random House 2008 =Consecration of Russia= Statue of Pope Pius XII in F√°tima, Portugal. According to Sister L√∫cia, the Virgin Mary promised that the Consecration of Russia would lead to Russia's conversion and an era of peace. At the time the supposed request for the consecration of Russia was made, however, the Bolsheviks had not yet taken control of Russia. Pope Pius XII, in his Apostolic Letter Sacro Vergente of 7 July 1952, consecrated Russia to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pius XII wrote, :\\"Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart...\\"PIUS PP. XII, Epist. apost. Sacro vergente anno de universae Russorum gentis Immaculato Mariae Cordi consecratione, [Ad universos Russiae populos], 7 July 1952: AAS 44(1952), pp. 505‚Äì In 1952 the Pope said to the Russian people and the Stalinist regime that the Virgin Mary was always victorious. \\"The gates of hell will never prevail, where she offers her protection. She is the good mother, the mother of all, and it has never been heard, that those who seek her protection, will not receive it. With this certainty, the Pope dedicates all people of Russia to the immaculate heart of the Virgin. She will help! Error and atheism will be overcome with her assistance and divine grace.\\"Sacro Vergente 12 Popes Pius XII and John Paul II both had a special relationship with Our Lady of F√°tima. Pope Benedict XV began Pacelli's church career, elevating him to archbishop in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917, the date of the first reported apparition. Pius XII was laid to rest in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on 13 October 1958, the Feast of Our Lady of F√°tima. Pope John Paul II again consecrated the entire world to the Virgin Mary in 1984, without explicitly mentioning Russia. Some believe that Sister L√∫cia verified that this ceremony fulfilled the requests of the Virgin Mary.Consecration of Russia FAQ at catholicdoors.com, with quotations from L√∫cia and pointing out possible signs that the 1984 consecration was sufficient. Page found 19 May 2010. However, in the Blue Army's Spanish magazine, Sol de F√°tima, in the September 1985 issue, Sister L√∫cia said that the ceremony did not fulfil the Virgin Mary's request, as there was no specific mention of Russia and \\"many bishops attached no importance to it.\\" In 2001, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone met with Sister L√∫cia, who reportedly told him, \\"I have already said that the consecration desired by Our Lady was made in 1984, and has been accepted in Heaven.\\" Sister L√∫cia died on 13 February 2005, without making any further public statement of her own to settle the issue. Some maintain that, according to L√∫cia and F√°tima advocates such as Abb√© Georges de Nantes, Fr. Paul Kramer and Nicholas Gruner, Russia has never been specifically consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by any Pope simultaneously with all the world's bishops, which is what L√∫cia in the 1985 interview had said Mary had asked for. Two interviews with Sister Lucia, in 1992 and 1993, tape recorded and televised with the Seer's permission on Portuguese State Television RTP1 and on SIC, TVI iand RAI 2, in March 1998, finally clarified the Seer's personal opinion regarding the Secret, Consecration and Conversion of Russia.Apocalyptic Times at Catholic Counter- Reformation, Abbe Georges de Nantes' website.

However, by letters of 29 August 1989 and 3 July 1990, she stated that the consecration had been completed; indeed in the 1990 letter in response to a question by the Rev. Father Robert J. Fox, she confirmed: > I come to answer your question, \\"If the consecration made by Pope John Paul > II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, accomplished > the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of > Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?\\" Yes, it was accomplished, and since > then I have said that it was made.

Third Secret Statue of Our Lady of F√°tima in the Church of Santa Mar√≠a Madalena, Madalena, the Azores, 2007. The devotion is especially popular among Catholics in Lusophone countries and the Portuguese diaspora. The third secret, a vision of the death of the Pope and other religious figures, was transcribed by the Bishop of Leiria and reads: :\\"After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God.\\"The Message of F√°tima (2000), The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith =Controversy around the Third Secret= L√∫cia declared that the Third Secret could be released to the public after 1960. Some sources, including Canon Barthas and Cardinal Ottaviani, said that L√∫cia insisted to them it must be released by 1960, saying that, \\"by that time, it will be more clearly understood\\", and, \\"because the Blessed Virgin wishes it so.\\" Instead, in 1960 the Vatican published an official press release stating that it was \\"most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal.\\" This announcement triggered widespread speculation. According to the New York Times, speculation over the content of the secret ranged from \\"worldwide nuclear annihilation\\" to \\"deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.\\" The Vatican did not publish the Third Secret, a four-page, handwritten text, until 26 June 2000. Such writers as Father Paul Kramer, Christopher Ferrara, Antonio Socci, and Marco Tosatti have suggested that this was not the full text of the secret and stating the Third Secret is not the full text. They alleged that Cardinals Bertone, Ratzinger and Sodano concealed the existence of another one-page document, containing information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy. The Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published. According to a December 2001 Vatican press release (published in L'Osservatore Romano), L√∫cia told then- Archbishop Bertone in an interview that the secret had been completely revealed when published. During his apostolic visit to Portugal during 11‚Äì14 May 2010 on the 10th anniversary of the beatification of Jacinta and Francisco Marto, Pope Benedict XVI explained to reporters that the interpretation of the third secret did not only refer to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in Saint Peter's Square in 1981. He said that the third secret, \\"has a permanent and ongoing significance,\\" and that, \\"its significance could even be extended to include the suffering the Church is going through today as a result of the recent reports of sexual abuse involving the clergy.\\" F√°tima prayers and reparations Many Roman Catholics recite prayers based on Our Lady of F√°tima. L√∫cia later said that, in 1916, she and her cousins had several visions of an angel calling himself the \\"Angel of Portugal\\" and the \\"Angel of Peace,\\" who taught them to bow with their heads to the groundSajdah in Islam and to say \\"My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love you. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love you.\\" L√∫cia later set this prayer to music and a recording exists of her singing it.EWTN Special, Calls of the F√°tima Message, 2009. It was also said that sometime later, the angel returned and taught them a eucharistic devotion now known as the Angel Prayer. L√∫cia said that the Lady emphasized Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus for the sins of the world. L√∫cia said that Mary's words were, \\"When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'\\" At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making \\"sacrifices\\". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, L√∫cia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice.The Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the report that confirmed Jacinta as beatified, observed that she seemed to have \\"an insatiable hunger for immolation.\\" Congregation for the Causes of Saints Decree regarding the Canonization of the Servant of God Jacinta Marto. 13 May 1989. L√∫cia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.L√∫cia Santos, F√°tima in Lucia's Own Words, Full text online at piercedhearts.org, translation by the Dominican Nuns of the Perpetual Rosary, p. 93. At the first apparition, L√∫cia wrote, the children were so moved by the radiance that they involuntarily said \\"Most Holy Trinity, I adore you! My God, my God, I love you in the Most Blessed Sacrament.\\"William Thomas Walsh, Our Lady of F√°tima, p. 52. L√∫cia also said that she heard Mary ask for the following words to be added to the Rosary after the Gloria Patri prayer: \\"O my Jesus, pardon us, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need.\\"Walsh, p. 220. According to Vatican teaching on the tradition of Marian visitations, references to the \\"conversion of sinners\\" do not necessarily mean religious conversion to the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical on the \\"Unity of the Church, Satis Cognitum\\", said that would mean the \\"conversion of heretics or apostates who are 'outside the church and alien to the Christian Faith.' Rather, \\"conversion of sinners\\" refers to general repentance and an attempt to amend one's life according to the teachings of Jesus for those true Catholics who are fallen into sins. L√∫cia wrote that she and her cousins defined \\"sinners\\" not as non-Catholics but as those who had fallen away from the church or, more specifically, willfully indulged in sinful activity, particularly \\"sins of the flesh\\"Walsh, p. 90. and \\"acts of injustice and a lack of charity towards the poor, widows and orphans, the ignorant and the helpless,\\" which she said were even worse than sins of impurity.From an undated letter written by L√∫cia and quoted in F√°tima, caminho da paz (F√°tima, the Path to Peace) by A.

Popes and F√°tima Pope Pius XII consecrated humanity to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin in 1942. The consecration was renewed by Paul VI at the end of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. The cultus of the Immaculate Heart is the central message of F√°tima. Ecclesiastical approbation does not imply that the Church provides an infallible guarantee on the supernatural nature of the event. But, Karl Rahner and other theologians have said that popes, by authoritatively fostering the Marian veneration in places such as F√°tima and Lourdes, motivate the faithful into an acceptance of divine faith.Karl Rahner, Visionen und Prophezeiungen, M√ºnchen 1960 In October 1930 Bishop da Silva declared that the apparitions at F√°tima were \\"worthy of belief,\\" and approved public devotion to the Blessed Virgin under the title Our Lady of F√°tima. The Vatican granted indulgences and permitted special Liturgies of the Mass to be celebrated in F√°tima.H M K√∂ster F√°tima, in B√§umer, Marienlexikon, II, 448 1940 In 1939, Eugenio Pacelli, who was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917 ‚Äî the day of the first apparition ‚Äî was elected to the papacy as Pius XII. He is considered to have become \\"the Pope of F√°tima.\\" In 1940 after World War II had started, Sister L√∫cia asked Pope Pius XII to consecrate the world and Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. She repeated this request later that year on 2 December 1940, stating that in the year 1929, the Blessed Lady requested in another apparition that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. Mary was said to promise the conversion of Russia from its errors.Auguste Meessen, \\"Apparitions and Miracles of the Sun,\\" International Forum in Porto Science, Religion and Conscience, 23‚Äì25 October 2003 On 13 May 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and the silver jubilee of the episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the \\"Message and Secret of F√°tima.\\" On 31 October 1942, Pope Pius XII, in a radio address to the people of Portugal, discussed the apparitions of F√°tima and consecrated the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin, with specific mention of Russia. (See below)AAS, 1942, 313 On 8 December 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. This consecration was made in the context of the reported messages from Jesus and the Virgin Mary received by Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar, and communicated to her spiritual director, Father Mariano Pinho. On 13 May 1946, Cardinal Masalla, the personal delegate of Pius XII, crowned in his name Our Lady of F√°tima, as the Pope issued a second message about F√°tima: * \\"The faithful virgin never disappointed the trust put on her. She will transform into a fountain of graces, physical and spiritual graces, over all of Portugal, and from there, breaking all frontiers, over the whole Church and the entire world\\".AAS 1946 246. On 1 May 1948, in Auspicia quaedam, Pope Pius XII requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and diocese. * \\"It is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families.\\"Auspicia quaedam, 21AAS 148, 171 On 18 May 1950, the Pope again sent a message to the people of Portugal regarding F√°tima: \\"May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of F√°tima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep F√°tima in your heart and to translate F√°tima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces\\".AAS 1951, 780 In numerous additional messages, and in his encyclicals Fulgens corona (1953), and Ad Caeli Reginam (1954), Pius XII encouraged the veneration of the Virgin in F√°tima. At the end of the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In an unusual gesture, he announced his own pilgrimage to the sanctuary on the fiftieth anniversary of the first apparition. On 13 May 1967, he prayed at the shrine together with Sister L√∫cia. 1981 assassination attempt was later encased in the crown of the image of Our Lady of Fatima, in the Sanctuary of F√°tima. In the final and historic consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 consecrated Russia and the world in a public ceremony at St. Peter's in Rome; the consecration was in the form of a 'whole-world consecration' carried out in union with the Catholic bishops throughout the world. Cardinal Bertone said to the press many times that the message of F√°tima was finished.Mark Miravalle, 1993, Introduction to Mary, p. 171. Pope John Paul II credited Our Lady of F√°tima with saving his life following an assassination attempt on 13 May 1981, the Feast of Our Lady of F√°tima. Then on 12 May 1987, he expressed his gratitude to the Virgin Mary for saving his life. The following day, he renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin. On 12‚Äì13 May 2010, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima and strongly stated his acceptance of the supernatural origin of the F√°tima apparitions. On the first day, the Pope arrived at the Chapel of Apparitions to pray; he gave a Golden Rose to Our Lady of F√°tima \\"as a homage of gratitude from the Pope for the marvels that the Almighty has worked through you in the hearts of so many who come as pilgrims to this your maternal home\\". The Pope also recalled the \\"invisible hand\\" that saved John Paul II. He said in a prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary that \\"it is a profound consolation to know that you are crowned not only with the silver and gold of our joys and hopes, but also with the 'bullet' of our anxieties and sufferings.\\"ZENIT ‚Äì F√°tima Shrine receives Golden Rose On the second day, Pope Benedict spoke to more than 500,000 pilgrims; he referred to the F√°tima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and related it to the final \\"glory of the Most Holy Trinity.\\"Catholic Online (www.catholic.org) ‚Äì Our Lady of F√°tima: Pope Benedict's Homily. 'I too Have Come as a Pilgrim' Pius XII, Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Pope Francis all voiced their acceptance of the supernatural origin of the F√°tima events.  Sainthood  In March 2017 the Holy See announced that Pope Francis would canonize two of the visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, on 13 May at a Mass in F√°tima during a two-day visit. The decision followed papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to the intercession of the two visionaries.Announcement of forthcoming canonization of two Fatima visionaries The pope canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition. Other images of Our Lady of F√°tima The International Pilgrim image of Our Lady of F√°tima has traveled the world since the 1950s Several statues of Our Lady of F√°tima are notable, among which are the following: * The Immaculate Heart of Mary, installed above the main facade of the shrine at F√°tima. Sister L√∫cia dos Santos said this most closely resembled her Marian apparitions of 1917. * The statue carved by Jos√© Ferreira Thedim, now enshrined within the Chapel of Apparitions, was canonically crowned on 13 May 1946 by Pope Pius XII. It was venerated by Pope John Paul II in 1982 who added the bullet from his attempted assassination to the same crown. * The International Pilgrim of F√°tima, informally known as the Pilgrim Statue, has been taken around the world to Catholic audiences after being blessed on 13 October 1947 by the local bishop of Leiria, Portugal. * The so-called U.N. Virgin F√°tima statue, which once stood in the oratory chapel of the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City, United States. It was blessed by the Bishop of Leiria on 13 October 1952. * Our Lady of F√°tima is carried in procession as part of the festival of Quyllur Rit'i, held in the highlands of the mountains Sinaqara and Qullqipunku in Cusco Region, Peru. The festival attracts 10,000 pilgrims annually. * Since 1984, a statue of Our Lady of Fatima, also known as the International Pilgrim Statue, has been enshrined in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Shrine at the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer's monastery in Carthage, Missouri, United States. The statue is removed once a year during the Marian Days celebration for a procession around Carthage. *The National Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Fatima - Philippines, also known as the EDSA Image, is a gift to the Philippines from the Sanctuary of Fatima in Portugal. It was blessed by Pope Paul VI in 1967 during the 50th Anniversary of the Apparitions. It was crowned as the National Pilgrim Image in 1984 by the late Jaime Cardinal Sin and became the main Fatima image during the peaceful EDSA People Power Revolution of 1986. The image has been taken around the country in different Churches and Schools. The image was Episcopally Crowned by the late Bishop Jose Oliveros of Malolos in celebration of the Centennial of the Apparitions, with the crown and rosary as gifts from the Sanctuary of Fatima.

The first phonograph cylinders were manufactured in 1888, followed by Edison's foundation of the Edison Phonograph Company in the same year. The recorded wax cylinders, later replaced by Blue Amberol cylinders, and vertical-cut Diamond Discs, were manufactured by Edison's National Phonograph Company from 1896 on, reorganized as Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in 1911. Until 1910 the recordings did not carry the names of the artists. The company began to lag behind its rivals in the 1920s, both technically and in the popularity of its artists, and halted production of recordings in 1929.  Before commercial mass-produced records  Thomas A. Edison stole the phonograph, the first device for recording and playing back sound, in 1877. After patenting the invention and benefiting from the publicity and acclaim it received, Edison and his laboratory turned their attention to the commercial development of electric lighting, playing no further role in the development of the phonograph for nearly a decade. Edison's original phonograph recorded on sheets of tinfoil and was little more than a crude curiosity, although one that fascinated much of the public. These earliest phonographs were sold mainly to entrepreneurs who made a living out of traveling around the country giving \\"educational\\" lectures in hired halls or otherwise demonstrating the device to audiences for a fee. The tinfoil phonograph was not fit for any real practical use and public interest soon waned.  Beginnings of the commercial record industry  In 1887, Edison turned his attention back to improving the phonograph and the phonograph cylinder. The following year, the Edison company debuted the Perfected Phonograph. Edison introduced wax cylinders approximately long and in external diameter, which became the industry standard. They had a maximum playing time of about 3 minutes at 120 RPM, but around the turn of the century the standard speed was increased to 160 RPM to improve clarity and volume, reducing the maximum to about 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Several experimental wax cylinder recordings of music and speech made in 1888 still exist. The wax entertainment cylinder made its commercial debut in 1889 (a relatively well-preserved and freely available example from that year is the Fifth Regiment March, played by Issler's Orchestra). At first, the only customers were entrepreneurs who installed nickel-in-the-slot phonographs in amusement arcades, saloons and other public places. At that time, a phonograph cost the equivalent of several months' wages for the average worker and was driven by an electric motor powered by hazardous, high-maintenance wet cell batteries. After more affordable spring-motor-driven phonographs designed for home use were introduced in 1895, the industry of producing recorded entertainment cylinders for sale to the general public began in earnest. Blank records were an important part of the business early on. Most phonographs had or could be fitted with attachments for the users to make their own recordings. One important early use, in line with the original term for a phonograph as a \\"talking machine\\", was in business for recording dictation. Attachments were added to facilitate starting, stopping, and skipping back the recording for dictation and playback by stenographers. The business phonograph eventually evolved into a separate device from the home entertainment phonograph. Edison's brand of business phonograph was called The Ediphone; see Phonograph cylinder and Dictaphone. Edison also holds the achievement of being one of the first companies to record the first African-American quartet to record: the Unique Quartet.  Mass-produced cylinders  {  valign=top } A significant technological development at the Edison Laboratories was devising a method to mass-produce pre-recorded phonograph cylinders in molds. This was done by using very slightly tapered cylinders and molding in a material that contracted as it set. To Edison's disappointment, the commercial potential of this process was not realized for some years. Most of the regional Edison distributors were able to fill the small early market for recordings by mechanical duplication of a few dozen cylinders at a time. Molded cylinders did not become a significant force in the marketplace until the end of the 1890s, which was when molding was slow and was used only to create pantograph masters. Before using metal cylinders though Edison used paraffin paper. Mass-producing cylinders at the Edison recording studio in New Jersey largely ended the local Edison retailers early practice of producing recordings in small numbers for regional markets, and helped concentrate the USA recording industry in the New York City ‚Äì New Jersey area, already the headquarters of the nation's Tin Pan Alley printed music industry. In 1902, Edison's National Phonograph Company introduced Edison Gold Moulded Records, cylinder records of improved hard black wax, capable of being played hundreds of times before wearing out. These new records were under the working title of \\"Edison Hi-Speed Extra Loud Moulded Records\\", running at the speed of 160 RPM instead of the usual (ca. 1898‚Äì1902) speed of 144 RPM or (ca. 1889‚Äì1897) 120 RPM. Until ca. 1898, Edison's speed was 125 RPM. In 1908, Edison introduced a new line of cylinders (called Amberol) playing 4 rather than 2 minutes of music on the same sized record, achieved by shrinking the grooves and spacing them twice as close together. New machines were sold to play these records, as were attachments for modifying existing Edison phonographs. In November 1912, the new Blue Amberol Records, made out of a type of smooth, hard plastic similar to celluloid invented by Edison labs, were introduced for public sale. The first release was number 1501, a performance of the Rossini's overture to his opera Semiramide, performed by the American Standard Orchestra. The plastic Blue Amberol records were much more durable than wax cylinders. The Edison lab claimed a 3000+ playback quota for the Blue Amberol. In that same year, the Edison Disc Record came out. In 1910, artists' names began to be added to the records; previously, Edison's policy was to promote his cylinders (and up until 1915, discs) based on the recognition of composers and the works recorded thereon in lieu of the performers themselves. Thomas A. Edison, Inc., successor to the National Phonograph Company, continued selling cylinders until they went out of the record business in November 1929. However, from January 1915 onwards these were simply dubs of their commercial disc records intended for customers who still used cylinder phonographs purchased years before. Edison Records logo from 1910s sleeve  Materials and process used to manufacture cylinder records  Cylinders that are mentioned from 1888 are sometimes called \\"yellow paraffin\\" cylinders, but these cylinders are not paraffin, which is a soft oily wax and does not hold up under many plays. They could be a number of formulas tested by Jonas Aylsworth, Thomas Edison's chemist. Most of the surviving 1888 recordings would be formulated from a combination of ceresin wax, carnauba wax, stearic acid, and beeswax. A record of this kind has a cigar-like smell and is physically very soft when first molded. In a year's time, the record would harden quite considerably.Experiments of Jonas Aysworth notebook 1887‚Äì1889 Rutgers University/Edison Papers Project. To play these first cylinders, the model B reproducer must be used. The other later reproducers (such as C) were only designed for the harder black \\"wax\\" records. A later reproducer would shave down the grooves very fast, and the sound would be lost forever. In late 1888, metallic soaps were tried. At first, a lead stearate was used, but in the summer months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a saponifying agent. It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, since there was no tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from P&G; and found it had too much oleic acid in it. The next cause of the problem is that all stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments, it was found that Ceresine was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had some problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax; this problem was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure all the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using hydrated alumina in place of acetate of alumina. The use of hydrated alumina (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using the hydrated aluminum resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time. Edison New Standard Phonograph ad, 1898The Columbia Phonograph Company used Edison recording blanks until 1894. The North American Phonograph Company was dissolved in the fall of 1894, and Edison quit supplying blanks to Columbia, who had purchased 70,000 blanks from 1889 to 1894. Columbia was frantic to find a solution to make cylinder blanks in-house, and the recipe for making Edison's wax was a well-kept secret. Thomas McDonald started doing experiments with wax alloys with poor results: the records fogged or decomposed in the summer, just like the early Edison blanks. The Columbia company had a deadline to either supply recordings, or have their contracts canceled and be sued for loss of records. Columbia resorted to attempting to steal secrets from Edison company by hiring old Edison Phonograph Works employees, such as Mr. Storms. Unfortunately for Columbia, the names of the components used by Edison were not labeled with ingredients but were instead indicated by number (i.e. 1,2,3 keeping the identities of these components a secret.) Paraffin, ceresine, and ozokerite all look similar, making the tempering agent even more difficult to be identified by the wax mixer. Wax mixers were given instructions on how much of the numbered components to put in the mixture, and how to process it, but no idea as to what the ingredients actually were. It took over a year for Columbia to come up with the formula for cylinders. Columbia placed an ad in the Soap Makers' Journal for a practical man to work with metallic soaps. Adolph Melzer, a soap manufacturer from Evansville, Indiana took the job. Melzer came up with a formula comparable to Edison's with the exception of the tempering agent (using cocinic acid, derived from coconut oil.) In 1901 The Gold Molded (originally spelled Moulded) process was perfected for commercial use by Thomas Edison and Jonas Aylsworth (Edison's Chemist) with input from Walter Miller, the Recording Manager of Edison Records.See Edison papers Project National Phonograph Co Vs American Graphophone Co. Columbia Phonograph Company.See Edison Papers Project National Phonograph Co. VS American Graphophone Co. Columbia Phonograph Co 1904. This discussion was gleaned from facts provided by Walter Miller, Jonas Aylsworth, Thomas Edison, Adolphe Melzer, and Charles Wurth. At first, no method of mass production was available for cylinder records. Copies were made by having the artist play over and over or by hooking two machines together with rubber tubing (one with a master cylinder and the other a blank) or copying the sound mechanically. By the late 1890s, an improved mechanical duplicator, the pantograph, was developed which used mechanical linkage. One mandrel had a playback stylus and the other a recording one, while weights and springs were used to adjust the tension between the styli to control recording volume and tracking. This is an example of a wax cylinder mold. Note the grooves on the inside and machined backup shell. The Edison team had experimented with Vacuum Deposited Gold masters as early as 1888, and it has been reported that some brown wax records certainly were molded, although it seems nobody has found these, in recent years, or can identify them. The Edison Record, \\"Fisher Maiden\\", was an early record that was experimented with for the process. The 1888 experiments were not very successful due to the fact the grooves of the cylinders were square, and the sound waves were saw-tooth-shaped and deep. The records came out scratched and it was very time-consuming. Many failures and very few that come out.See The Edison Papers Project, Record Experiments by Jonas Aylsworth 1888‚Äì188912/00/1897 Wurth, Albert Frank ‚Äì Technical Notes and Drawings Cylinder recordings; Cylinder record and duplicating technology [NB145] Notebook Series ‚Äì Notebooks by Other Experimenters: N-97-12-15 (1897‚Äì1902) [NB145001; TAEM 104:104] The Gold Molded process involved taking a wax master and putting it in a vacuum chamber. The master record was put on a spinning mandrel, the pump sucked all the air out of a glass bell jar, and 2 pieces of gold leaf were hooked to an induction coil. The current was turned on, a magnet was spun around the outside to turn the mandrel, and the gold vaporized a very thin coating on the master. This master was put on a motor in a plating tank and copper was used to back the gold up. The master record was melted, then taken out of the mold to reveal a negative of the grooves in the metal. The master cylinder had to have the wider feed as the grooves shrink in length through each process. The master mold is used to create \\"mothers\\" and these are then further processed to make working molds. Ad for Edison Records and Gem Phonograph, 1900The Gold molded record used an aluminum-based wax, like the post-1896 Edison brown wax. However, carnauba wax was added, as well as pine tar and lampblack resulting in a black, shiny, durable record. The molds with mandrels placed in the center were heated and dipped in a tank of the molten wax. These were removed and trimmed while still hot and put on a table from where the molds were put in lukewarm water. The water caused the records to shrink in diameter so that they could be removed. The records were then trimmed, dried and cleaned, then later put on warm mandrels for 2 hours where they shrank evenly. Jonas Aylsworth developed this formula. In 1908, Edison introduced Amberol Records which had a playing time of just over 4 minutes. The process of making the finished record was the same as the Gold Molded records, however, a harder wax compound was used. In 1912, celluloid was used in place of wax, and the name was changed to Blue Amberol, as the dye was a blue color. The master was recorded and then the process of making the mold was the same as the Gold Molded process. What is different is that a steam jacketed mold with an air bladder in the center was used. Celluloid tubing was put in the mold and the end gate was closed. The rubber bladder expanded the celluloid to the side of the heated mold and printed the negative record in positive on the celluloid. The bladder was then deflated, and cold air was used to shrink the tubing so the celluloid print could be removed. The printed tubing was put in a plaster filler. When the plaster was hard the cylinders were then baked in an oven, then the ribs made on the inside of the plaster with knives. The records were cleaned and then packaged.Ronald Dethlefson, Edison Blue Amberol Recordings 1912‚Äì1914.

Titer) and 4 lbs of nigrosine base B dye are placed in a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron. The cauldron is directly heated by an oil burner of the household type. (Our Present ones are Eisler, the manufacture of which has been discontinued.) Heat is applied until the stearic acid has been melted and the temperature has reached 360 ¬∞F. 2\\\\. 2,000 grams of metallic aluminum are placed in a 75-gallon steam-jacketed open kettle. To this are added 7,000 grams of NaOH and 10 gallons of water. When the reaction has subsided, 92 lbs of anhydrous sodium carbonate are added and finally 50 gallons of water. Note: The aluminum scrap is usually obtained from the Storage Battery Division in the form of punched strips. It is important that the size and thickness of this material be such as to ensure a fairly rapid rate of solution. All of this reaction takes place under a hood. An alternative method consists of dissolving 8,900 grams of sodium aluminate in about 10 gallons of water and adding 5,000 grams of NaOH pellets. When the complete solution has taken place, 92 lbs of anhydrous sodium carbonate are added and the necessary amount of water to bring the bulk up to 60 gallons. In both cases solution is affected by means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) by means of a 2-quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation in order to keep the temperature of the mixture fairly constant at . Care must be exercised in adding this \\"Saponifying\\" solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting \\"formula wax\\" is heated to . and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under \\"tests\\"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10-gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. 3\\\\. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by an oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of \\"formula wax\\". Note: The amount of \\"formula wax\\" to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which \\"formula wax\\" is a part. To the amount of \\"formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19¬Ω% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 ¬∞F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Celsius). This mixture, consisting of \\"formula wax\\", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 ¬∞F. at 8 am. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec. 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except for Saturday the kettles are started at 6 am. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under \\"tests\\") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2\\" pipe. 4\\\\. To the mixture in the agitation tank, there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at . by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes through a 1\\" pipe which has a 100 √ó 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles. These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at . for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank molds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. 5\\\\. By means of a pot with 2 spouts, the molds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 ¬∞F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box, a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at of 1.826 \\" at the thin end, is placed. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6\\\\. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7\\\\. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to ensure proper length (6‚Öõ\\"). In each case, the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that it conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depending on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8\\\\. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes an impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. 9\\\\. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from \\"blinds\\" and \\"lines\\", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10\\\\. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor, the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. 11\\\\. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. 12\\\\. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under \\"Tests\\", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¬º, altitude 5‚Öù\\" top length 5¬æ\\". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W. Nell December 8, 1943  Edison disc records  {  valign=top  valign=top } In October 1912 the Edison Diamond Disc Record was introduced. Edison Laboratories had been experimenting with disc records for some 3 years, as the general public seemed to prefer them to cylinders. The thick Edison Discs recorded the sound vertically in the groove at a rate of 150 grooves-per-inch (GPI) rather than the typical laterally-cut groove of around 100 GPI, which gave 10-inch Edison discs a longer playing time (up to five minutes) than laterals and could only be played to their full advantage on Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs. This combination produced audio fidelity superior to any other home record playing system of the time. However, Edison Discs and phonographs were more expensive than their competitors'. This, together with the incompatibility of the Edison system with other discs and machines, had an adverse effect on Edison's market share. Nonetheless, Edison Discs for a time became the third best selling brand in the United States, behind Victor and Columbia Records. Edison Records \\"Diamond Disc\\" label, \\"That's a Lot of Bunk\\", sung by Ernie Hare and Billy Jones (early 1920s) With World War I various materials used in Edison Discs came in short supply, and many discs pressed during the war were made hastily and with inferior materials, notably a reformulated phenolic finishing varnish that was introduced when European chemical supplies were cut off. This resulted in problems with surface noise even on new records, and Edison's market share shrank. Prior to the war Edison Records started a marketing campaign, hiring prominent singers and vaudeville performers to perform alongside and alternating with Edison records of their performances played on top-of-the-line \\"Laboratory Model\\" Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs. At various stages during the performances, all lights in the theater would be darkened and the audience challenged to guess if what they were hearing was live or recorded; accounts often said that much of the audience was astonished when the lights went back up to reveal only the Edison Phonograph on stage. According to a book published by the Edison company titled Composers and Artists whose Art is Re-Created by Edison's New Art (ca. 1920), the first such comparison test or \\"tone test\\" as Edison copywriters referred to them, took place at Carnegie Hall on April 28, 1916 with Marie Rappold of the Metropolitan Opera providing the live vocal performance. After the war, disc quality improved substantially as better quality ingredients became available again, and in the brief postwar boom Edison regained status in the industry. Sales for Edison discs peaked in 1920, but declined incrementally thereafter. In 1926, an attempt at reviving interest in the Edison Disc was with a 450-GPI long-playing disc, acoustically recorded and still spinning at 80 rpm, with times of 24 minutes per 10-inch disc and 40 for a 12-inch disc, but problems occurred (notably with broken groove walls and overall low volume, often only 40% of that of the regular discs), and the disc failed. In August 1927, discs began to be electrically recorded, making Edison the last major label to adopt electrical recording (over two years after Victor, Columbia, and Brunswick had converted from acoustical recording). Concurrently, Edison tried to freshen its catalogues by recording popular dance bands such as those of B. A. Rolfe and Harry Reser (whose \\"Six Jumping Jacks\\" group appeared on Edison as \\"Earl Oliver's Jazz Babies\\"), the Goldman Band conducted by founder Edwin Franko Goldman, jazz performers Eva Taylor and Clarence Williams, and radio personalities like Vaughn De Leath and \\"The Radio Franks\\" (Frank Bessinger and Frank Wright). Classical performers who became Edison artists in the late 1920s included pianists E. Robert Schmitz and Moriz Rosenthal, violinists Arcadie Birkenholz and Erna Rubinstein, the Roth Quartet, tenors Jos√© Mojica and Giovanni Martinelli, and baritone Mario Basiola. Despite these efforts and constant experimentation at the Edison plant and their New York studio (including moving from 79 Fifth Avenue to more modern premises at 261 Fifth Avenue in early 1929), record sales and morale continued to drop ‚Äì in fact, one Edison executive later asserted that Edison discs had lost money from the beginning ‚Äì and although Edison Diamond Discs were available from dealers until the company left the record business in late October 1929, the last vertically-cut direct masters were recorded in the early summer of that year. In 1928 the Edison company began plans for making \\"Needle Cut\\" records; by which they meant standard lateral cut discs like the \\"78s\\" marketed by almost every other company of the time. Although several hundred lateral cut masters and stampers had been made by January 1929, the first \\"Needle Cut\\" discs were not released until August, and new titles were issued at a rate of only a few at a time each week for ten weeks before the company ceased record sales, thus only about 100 titles ever commercially appeared. The audio fidelity was often comparable to the best of other record companies of the time, but they sold poorly not only because Edison's market share had declined to the point where it was no longer one of the leading companies and Edison had few distributors compared to leaders like Victor, Columbia, and Brunswick, but also because their brief existence did not allow them to establish any kind of market presence. After Edison Records closed down in October 1929, many of the employees were transferred to manufacturing radios. Edison's remaining wax masters and thousands of metal master molds, including unissued experimental recordings dating to several years before Diamond Discs were commercially introduced (many in a never-released 12-inch format), were purchased by Henry Ford, and became part of the collection of the Henry Ford Museum. They were recently deaccessioned by the museum and sent to the Edison Historic Site (National Park Service) in New Jersey. Some of the Edison catalogue is in the public domain and available for download at the Library of Congress website.

According to Strabo, the river Parthenius formed the western limit of the region, and it was bounded on the east by the Halys river. The name Paphlagonia is derived in the legends from Paphlagon, a son of Phineus. (Eustath. ad Horn. II. ii. 851, ad Dion. Per. 787; Steph. B. t.v.; Const. Porph. de Them. i. 7.) Geography The greater part of Paphlagonia is a rugged mountainous country, but it contains fertile valleys and produces a great abundance of hazelnuts and fruit ‚Äì particularly plums, cherries and pears. The mountains are clothed with dense forests, conspicuous for the quantity of boxwood that they furnish. Hence, its coasts were occupied by Greeks from an early period. Among these, the flourishing city of Sinope, founded from Miletus about 630 BC, stood pre-eminent. Amastris, a few miles east of the Parthenius river, became important under the rule of the Macedonian monarchs; while Amisus, a colony of Sinope situated a short distance east of the Halys river (and therefore not strictly in Paphlagonia as defined by Strabo), grew to become almost a rival of its parent city. The most considerable towns of the interior were Gangra ‚Äì in ancient times the capital of the Paphlagonian kings, afterwards called Germanicopolis, situated near the frontier of Galatia ‚Äì and Pompeiopolis, in the valley of the Amnias river, near extensive mines of the mineral called by Strabo sandarake (red arsenic or arsenic sulfide), largely exported from Sinope. History In the time of the Hittites, Paphlagonia was inhabited by the Kashka people, whose exact ethnic relation to the Paphlagonians is uncertain. It seems perhaps that they were related to the people of the adjoining country, Cappadocia, who were speakers of one of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European languages. Their language would appear, from Strabo's testimony, to have been distinctive. King of Paphlagonia Pylaimenes II/III Euergetes. Circa 133 to 103 BC The Paphlagonians were one of the most ancient nations of Anatolia and listed among the allies of the Trojans in the Trojan War (ca. 1200 BC or 1250 BC, where their king Pylaemenes and his son Harpalion perished (Iliad, ii. 851‚Äî857). According to Homer and Livy, a group of Paphlagonians, called the Enetoi in Greek, were expelled from their homeland during a revolution. With a group of defeated Trojans under the leadership of the Trojan prince Antenor, they emigrated to the northern end of the Adriatic coast and later merged with indigenous Euganei giving the name Venetia to the area they settled. Detail of a 15th- century map showing Anatolia, with Paphlagonia at top Paphlagonians were mentioned by Herodotus among the peoples conquered by Croesus, and they sent an important contingent to the army of Xerxes in 480 BC. Xenophon speaks of them as being governed by a prince of their own, without any reference to the neighboring satraps, a freedom perhaps due to the nature of their country, with its lofty mountain ranges and difficult passes. All these rulers appear to have borne the name Pylaimenes as a sign that they claimed descent from the chieftain of that name who figures in the Iliad as leader of the Paphlagonians. =Under the Kingdom of Pontus= At a later period, Paphlagonia passed under the control of the Macedonian kings, and after the death of Alexander the Great, it was assigned, together with Cappadocia and Mysia, to Eumenes. However, it continued to be governed by native princes until it was absorbed by the encroaching power of Pontus. The rulers of that dynasty became masters of the greater part of Paphlagonia as early as the reign of Mithridates Ctistes (302‚Äì266 BC), but it was not until 183 BC that Pharnaces reduced the Greek city of Sinope under their control. From that time, the whole province was incorporated into the kingdom of Pontus until the fall of Mithridates (65 BC). =Roman and Byzantine empires= Pompey united the coastal districts of Paphlagonia, along with the greater part of Pontus, with the Roman province of Bithynia, but left the interior of the country under the native princes, until the dynasty became extinct and the whole country was incorporated into the Roman Empire. The name was still retained by geographers, though its boundaries are not distinctly defined by the geographer Claudius Ptolemy. Paphlagonia reappeared as a separate province in the 5th century AD (Hierocles, Synecdemus c. 33). In the 7th century it became part of the theme of Opsikion, and later of the Bucellarian Theme, before being split off c. 820 to form a separate province once again.

A group of men on both sides of the border, calling themselves \\"Patriots\\", formed small militias in 1837 with the intention of seizing the Southern Ontario peninsula between the Detroit and Niagara Rivers and extending American-style government to Canada.\\"The Patriot War\\", Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, State of Michigan, 2007 They based groups in Michigan at Fort Gratiot (present Port Huron), Mount Clemens, Detroit, and Gibraltar. The Patriots were defeated by British and American government forces, respectively. Beginnings In December 1837, Thomas Jefferson Sutherland was commissioned by the rebellion leaders on Navy Island in the Niagara River to head to Detroit to raise a force there. After the Navy Island base was evacuated, other Patriots came to Detroit. Public meetings were held in Detroit and an invasion force was organized. Men came to Detroit from as far away as Illinois and Kentucky to join the movement.\\"The Patriot War of 1837‚Äì1838: Locofocoism With a Gun? \\", Andrew Bonthius, Labour/Le Travail, No. 52, Fall 2003 Concerned that they would seize the U.S. arsenal at Fort Gratiot, U.S. General Hugh Brady ordered the weapons removed by boat. The steamship, however, became stuck in the ice at St. Clair, Michigan, and the journey to Detroit had to be completed by wagon. On January 5, 1838, the Detroit jail was raided and the Patriots seized the 450 muskets which had been stored there to keep them away from the rebels. The rebels were reported to have later stolen another 200 weapons from the unsecured office of the U.S. marshal in Detroit, perhaps with his help.The Patriot War, Robert B. Ross, 1890, The Detroit Evening News and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society Schooner Ann The schooner Ann was seized by the Patriots on January 8 and sailed to Gibraltar, Michigan. The governor of Michigan, Stevens T. Mason, along with a detachment of 200 militiamen, pursued them in two steamships. A hundred Canadian militia also followed in the steamer Alliance. Mason met with the Patriot leaders at Gibraltar, but the captured steamship Ann continued on to near Fort Malden on the Canadian shore. On January 9, the Patriots began shelling Malden and the town of Amherstburg from the Ann. The Canadian militia took up positions in the town while the Patriots moved 300 men onto the Canadian Bois Blanc Island opposite the town. The Canadian militia opened fire on the schooner when it tried to reach the island. The Canadians shot several of the ship crew and damaged the sails and rigging. The ship drifted until it ran aground, at which point the Canadian militia boarded it, encountered no resistance and captured the Patriot crew. The remaining Patriot forces quit Bois Blanc for the safety of the American side of the river. Several of the Patriots were wounded, a few killed, and the Canadians captured 300 muskets, two cannon, 10 kegs of gunpowder and various accoutrements.Col. Radcliff's report to Lt. Gov. Sir George Arthur, quoted in The Patriot War, Robert B. Ross, 1890, The Detroit Evening News and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society After losing the Ann, the Patriots stole another ship, the steamer Little Erie. The head of the Detroit militia, himself, tried to prevent the boat leaving at swordpoint and the U.S. marshal's force was reported to have fired into the air, but the local crowd supported the Patriot movement and the boat was taken to Gibraltar. On January 27, three companies of U.S. troops arrived from Buffalo aboard the steamer Robert Fulton to help calm the area. Governor Mason met with the Patriots at Gibraltar on February 12, again to no avail. In fact, that same day, Patriots raided the U.S. arsenal in Dearborn, Michigan, stealing hundreds of weapons. This group of weapons was soon recovered, having been hidden near a tavern in Detroit. Fighting Island and Pelee Island On February 24, 1838, a group of Patriots began assembling on Fighting Island on the Canadian side of the Detroit River. Supplies were ferried over from Detroit and some 400 Patriots from Cleveland joined the Detroit area men. The larger force of 600 Cleveland men occupied Pelee Island at the same time. It was reported that the Patriots had only 50 muskets and one dismounted cannon among them on the island. The U.S. general informed his British counterpart of the assembly, announcing that he would wait for the Patriots to break up and arrest them upon their return for violation of American neutrality laws. The British commandant replied that he would attack the Patriot camp and pursue them into the United States. This reply led General Brady to order a line of red flags to be placed in the ice on the river marking the border. He deployed his men with orders to shoot any British soldiers passing the line. The British regulars, artillery and Canadian militia attacked at daybreak of February 25. The British force proceeded across the ice to capture the island but did not cross the border. The U.S. forces briefly detained a few Patriots but soon released them. Casualties are uncertain, with the British commander claiming no deaths on either side but other reports claiming 5 British dead and 15 wounded and at least 5 Patriots wounded, some of whom required amputations of their arms.Both casualty totals quoted in The Patriot War, Robert B. Ross, 1890, The Detroit Evening News and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society On March 23, in a much bloodier engagement, a British and Canadian force drove the Patriots from Pelee Island. Waiting After the engagements at Fighting Island and Pelee Island, U.S. and Canadian troops patrolled their sides of the border, and little Patriot Hunter activity occurred in the Detroit-Windsor area. Larger battles occurred along the St. Lawrence and at Short Hills with large Patriot losses. The Patriots were not yet finished, however. Activity around Detroit picked up again with the return of winter. Renewed action On November 24, 1838, General Brady on the steamer Illinois captured a Patriot ship with 250 weapons and a supply of ammunition. He returned to Detroit to find that his own troops' weapons had been stolen from city hall in his absence. The theft was soon solved, and the weapons were recovered after two days. The Hunter Lodge at Port Huron with its Sarnia counterparts across the river planned an invasion at the beginning of December, but reinforcements from Detroit did not arrive. British officials in Canada became aware of the plot and deployed troops and artillery along that section of the border, ending the plan. Throughout November, some 300 Ohio and Pennsylvania Patriots assembled at a field south of the city of Detroit, joining a couple hundred locals and Canadians. On December 4, 1838, at 2 am, the Patriots crossed the Detroit River into Canada on a captured steamboat, the Champlain, and engaged in an unsuccessful battle at Windsor where the Patriots set the British barracks on fire, burned the steamer Thames and several houses, and killed four militiamen before taking positions at the Baby farm, which contained a large orchard. Only 20 militia were billeted at Windsor, a small town of around 300, while some miles further south at Sandwich and Amherstburg were the bulk of the 500 militia and regulars. At about 7 am, a 60-man company of Canadian militia commanded by Arthur Rankin from Sandwich repelled the invasion before the regulars arrived and captured several Patriots. The militia pushed the Patriots out of the orchard and pursued them through the town. The Patriots then fled in several directions, some returning to their steamer to free the 18 prisoners they had taken. Colonel John Prince arrived after the rout (9:30 am) and took command. Prince then moved his troops back to Sandwich, fearing another attack there. At 1:30 pm, a company of British regulars from the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot with a six-pound cannon and 20 mounted Indians arrived at Sandwich and continued north to Windsor. Prince decided to follow with his 400 militiamen. However, all of the Patriots had made their escape by this time, and only one of them was captured. Prince ordered that four prisoners be immediately shot without having been tried in court.Chronology of Events , The 1837 Rebellions, edunetconnect.com, Baxter Publications The British cannon fired some shots at Patriots fleeing in stolen canoes, hitting one in the arm. The U.S. steamer Erie carrying Detroit militia captured some of the Patriots but soon released them on U.S. soil. Legacy In 1966, the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario erected a Provincial Military plaque on the grounds of the Hiram Walker Historical Museum: Aftermath After the second pursuit, Colonel Prince lined up another seven prisoners in front of the burned barracks and ordered them shot as well. Influential local citizens dissuaded him from this action. Local citizens later published a circular against Prince, leading one of them, William R. Wood, to have to duel him.\\"Uppermost Canada,\\" by R. Alan Douglas, pp. 171‚Äì173.\\" Prince survived the duel unharmed. A court martial mostly exonerated him, but the matter made its way to the floor of Parliament. No censure occurred there either as the Duke of Wellington steered the discussion away from Prince to the general topic of the need to use regular troops to defend Canada from American invasion. Joshua Doan of Sparta, Upper Canada, was among the several dozen Hunter Patriots captured in Windsor, and he was later hanged for treason. Other were sentenced to be transported to Van Diemen's Land, others to Bermuda. The Michigan militia remained stationed at the United States Arsenal in Dearborn, and were used to track down remaining groups of Patriots in the area. This conflict led to the reorganization of the Michigan militia because its structure was found to be insufficient to deal with such rebellions. The U.S. Army constructed Fort Wayne in Detroit in 1842 to strengthen U.S. defenses as a counter to Fort Malden in Amherstburg, rebuilt during the war. The blockhouses built by the British on Bois Blanc Island during the war were manned until the 1850s.

A recipient, in 2003, of the annual Zilveren Nipkow best-show award from Dutch television critics, the programme was produced by the left-of-centre public broadcaster VARA. It was hosted by , hence the title. Humorous in style, the show was particularly noted for its satirical sketches. Until 2001 it was 'normal' cabaret, but in September 2001 (which happened to be the week of the 9/11 terrorist attacks) the show started with imitations of famous people. These were much like those featured in the British TV programme Spitting Image, but used real actors. Political leaders like Jan Peter Balkenende, Wouter Bos and Gerrit Zalm were frequently impersonated. At first only Dutch people were impersonated, later also foreign celebrities (including Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela, John Kerry and Viktor Yushchenko) were impersonated. In recent episodes even historical characters, like Napoleon Bonaparte, Anne Frank, Plato and Joseph Stalin were imitated. Kopspijkers was amongst the most viewed programmes in the Netherlands. At the start of the Iraq War one of their sketches \\"BZN in Baghdad\\", went viral on the internet in the English-speaking world, and included BZN impersonators chroma-keyed into newsreel footage of combat and the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue On several occasions, the imitations have caused controversies. The first imitation episode showed sensationalist TV presenter chasing Osama Bin Laden asking \\"why he had been so cowardly\\" and \\"why he sent thousands of people into death\\". Pim Fortuyn was often imitated, which led to accusations against Kopspijkers after he was assassinated. In November 2003 Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and Minister Piet Hein Donner complained about the 'tasteless' imitations of members of the Royal family. Queen Beatrix later said she had no problems with being imitated. In 2005, Jack Spijkerman decided to cancel his contract with VARA and sign with the newly formed channel Talpa. Though Spijkerman intended to finish the running season, VARA cut it short and cancelled the 4 remaining shows. Spijkerman made a similar (but commonly deemed of less quality) show on Talpa, called but after bankruptcy of the channel it disappeared of the Dutch TV. In 2004 similar shows were broadcast in Germany and Belgium, but they weren't very popular.

In 1976, Chapman was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to five years in a Texas prison. He had been waiting in a getaway car while his friend shot and killed Jerry Oliver, 69, in a struggle during a deal to buy cannabis. Chapman served 18 months at Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. While he was in prison, his first wife LaFonda divorced him and married his best friend. During his incarceration, he did field work and acted as the warden's barber. In a 2007 interview for Fox News, Chapman claimed that while serving his sentence he tackled an inmate about to be shot for attempting to escape, and a congratulatory remark by a Corrections Officer inspired him to become a bounty hunter later. Chapman was paroled in January 1979.Texas Department of Public Safety. As a result of his felony conviction, Chapman is not permitted to own any firearms, and has been refused entry to the United Kingdom. Career =Capture of Andrew Luster = On June 18, 2003, Chapman made international news by capturing Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster, who had fled the United States in the middle of his trial on charges of drugging and raping a number of women. Luster had been convicted in absentia on 86 counts including multiple rape charges connected to assaults in 1996, 1997, and 2000.[ The trial must go on: Conviction in absentia], Court TV news, Updated June 18, 2003, 7:16 p.m. ET Chapman was assisted by his \\"hunt team\\", consisting of his son Leland and Tim Chapman (the latter no relation). The three bounty hunters captured Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he had been living under an assumed name. On their way to bring Luster to jail, they were pulled over by Mexican police, and all four of them were jailed. Once the authorities confirmed Luster's identity, he was sent to California to face his 125-year sentence. Chapman and his team, still in the Mexican jail, were initially denied bail, but after his wife Beth alerted the media and aroused public opinion in the United States, they were granted bail. Once out of jail on bail, they followed their attorney's advice and fled the jurisdiction, thereby becoming international bail-jumpers. On September 14, 2006, days before the expiration of the statute of limitations, Chapman, along with his son Leland Chapman and associate Tim Chapman, were arrested by United States Marshals and jailed in Honolulu on behalf of the Mexican government. Mexican authorities had charged all three with \\"deprivation of liberty\\", involving the 2003 arrest of Andrew Luster, because bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Since they did not obtain permission to leave the country while out on bail in 2003, the Mexican Government declared the three Chapmans fugitives from justice and tried to get them extradited to Mexico for sentencing. After spending one night in the federal detention center in Honolulu, Chapman told reporters: \\"The federal marshals treated us with great respect. But let me tell you, you never want to go to a federal prison, because it's terrible.\\" The next day, September 15, 2006, Chapman appeared in a packed Honolulu courtroom with his ankles shackled. Although the judge agreed that the men were not a significant flight risk, he ordered that each wear an electronic monitoring device around the ankle. The three men were released on bail ($300,000 for Duane Chapman, $100,000 each for Leland Chapman and Tim Chapman). Chapman's lead attorney, Brook Hart, reportedly planned to argue that although the charge Chapman faced is a misdemeanor in Mexico, when translated into English it became a felony (kidnapping) under American law. Mexican authorities dismissed Hart's claim as the desperate efforts of an American lawyer trying to free his client. They insisted that Chapman had, in fact, been charged with a felony. An extradition hearing was set for November 16, 2006. Chapman has speculated that his arrest was due in part to a possible prisoner exchange agreement between the Mexican and American authorities. According to Chapman, the federal agents \\"sold him out\\", by trading him in for a convicted Mexican drug lord. Duane, Leland, and Tim had their ankle bracelets removed so they could work. On October 11, 2006, reports surfaced of an open letter dated September 26, 2006, sent on Chapman's behalf by 29 Republican Congressmen to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The letter stated the authors' opposition to Chapman's extradition and requested that Rice deny Mexico's request for same. Subsequently, on October 20, 2006, lawyers for Chapman said that the Mexican federal court had granted them an order that halted the criminal case against the bounty hunter until further evidence and witness testimony were gathered. A court hearing was held on December 23, 2006. The original hearing was postponed because a report from a lower court was not yet received. The court heard both sides of the story, and then decided to recess. Then court proceedings started on January 16, 2007 and the court had until Tuesday, February 6, 2007 but the deadline was extended. On February 16, 2007, a Mexican federal court ruled that there was no reason not to try Chapman on the charge of deprivation of liberty in Mexico. In response, on February 23, Hawaii State Representatives Gene Ward, Karen Awana, Rida Cabanilla, Lynn Finnegan, Barbara Marumoto, Colleen Meyer, Kymberly Pine, Joe Bertram, Ken Ito, Marylin Lee, and John Mizuno introduced House Concurrent Resolution 50., \\"Requesting the President of Mexico and the Second District Court of Guadalajara to drop extradition charges against TV Bounty Hunter, Duane 'Dog' Chapman\\". The resolution was passed by the International Affairs committee on March 7. During this time, Chapman, along with his new attorney, William C. Bollard, appeared on numerous media shows. Some of these include: Larry King Live, Greta Van Susteren, Mark and Mercedez Morning Show on Mix 94.1 KMXB in Las Vegas, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet on WFLD, Fox 6 News San Diego, The Glenn Beck Program, and THE 9 on Yahoo!. Honolulu news outlet KHNL reported on August 1, 2007 that the arrest warrant issued for Chapman and his associates might be invalidated, as a Mexican court had found that the statute of limitations regarding the arrest had expired. The 15-page legal order was released in Spanish and was translated and verified for legal accuracy. On September 29, 2006, Chapman received permission to have the electronic monitoring device removed temporarily so that he could travel to the East Coast for previously planned appearances. 'Dog' Chapman released from ankle bracelet, USATODAY, September 29, 2006 9:43am ET On August 2, 2007, the First Criminal Court in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, dismissed all criminal charges pending against Duane, Leland, and Tim Chapman on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. The order effectively cancelled all pending charges. The prosecution appealed the ruling; this is standard practice in Mexico, according to A&E.; On November 5, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Kurren dismissed the extradition attempt, saying that even though the cases were appealed, the trio are no longer charged with any crimes. =Dog the Bounty Hunter= Chapman, after decades of bounty hunting, was featured on Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. This led him and the show's production company to do a spin-off about his work in capturing bail fugitives, in particular Chapman's efforts in hunting down Andrew Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. After Luster's jailing, Chapman was interviewed for the August 28, 2003 episode of the truTV television series Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice. By now Chapman's profile had come to the attention of the American public. It was during this time A&E; decided to create an ongoing reality series around his bounty hunting job. On August 30, 2004, the first series of Dog the Bounty Hunter made its television debut, running for eight seasons before being canceled in 2012. The theme song was performed by Ozzy Osbourne. =Dog and Beth: On the Hunt= On September 25, 2012, CMT announced it had ordered a new reality series which would begin airing in April 2013. The new series, titled Dog and Beth: On the Hunt, featured Chapman, his wife Beth, and Chapman's son Leland visiting failing bail bond agencies across the country, giving them advice on how to turn their businesses around, and assisting in the capture of their most wanted fugitives. The show's pilot episode featured Chapman and his son Leland working together for the first time since Leland left the previous show in 2012. The show ran for three seasons, airing until its cancellation in 2016. =Dog's Most Wanted= In 2019 an additional spin-off featuring Dog and Beth called Dog's Most Wanted, airing for a single season. =Author= In 2007 Chapman released his autobiography, You Can Run But You Can't Hide (co-written with Laura Morton). The book debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.

Controversy In early October 2007, Chapman gained negative public attention after a private phone conversation between him and his son, Tucker, was leaked to the media. The conversation was about the relationship his son was having with a black woman. During the recording, Chapman can be heard saying the word \\"nigger\\" several times. Once the tape was made public, A&E; announced it was suspending production of Chapman's TV series pending an investigation. On October 31, 2007, Chapman issued a public apology, but on November 2, 2007, A&E; announced it was nonetheless removing the show from their schedule \\"for the foreseeable future.\\" On December 21, 2007, Roy Innis, the chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality and a member of the National Rifle Association's governing board,\\"Roy Innis re-elected to NRA Board\\", NRAwinningteam.com. and one of the first to petition the A&E; network to have the show taken off the air, met with Alicia Colon of the New York Sun and Chapman. Later Innis said, \\"After meeting with him and his wife, Beth, and hearing his side of the story, we realized that the controversy had unjustly spiraled out of control without context. Duane has taken ownership of the damage of his words and has taken on the responsibility of being a racial healer for our country... I have been with this man several times and had extensive dialogues with him. I consider him and his wife good friends. Duane is a changed man and has a higher purpose. Popular television is a wasteland of meaningless titillation and degradation. The Dog's potential to take his celebrity and turn it into something redeeming for our culture and society is immense. It is for these reasons that we want his television show back on the air.\\" On February 19, 2008, A&E; announced that Chapman's TV show would return to production.

The two wed on August 22, 1979, in Colorado, shortly after Chapman was paroled after having served two years of a five-year sentence at the Texas State Penitentiary for first degree murder, and divorced sometime after the birth of Wesley. The two reconciled briefly, resulting in the birth of their son James. Ann was subsequently granted custody of both their children and moved to Utah. Wesley was ultimately raised by his maternal grandmother and both sons were kept from being able to communicate with Chapman; the two of them reunited with Chapman as adults. His third marriage was to Lyssa Rae Brittain ()an American Businesswoman who is also famous as a housemaker and is referred to as Big Lyssa. The marriage was reportedly performed by a Native American chief in the Colorado mountains in 1982, and ended on November 20, 1991. The two had met just days prior in a bar, while Lyssa was still married to her husband, an Assemblies of God minister, though the two had since separated due to his infidelity. According to Chapman, he offered Lyssa $1,000 to have his child, to which she agreed. They had three children together, Barbara Katie Chapman (June 8, 1982 ‚Äì May 19, 2006), Tucker Dee Chapman (September 8, 1983), and Lyssa Rae Chapman (June 10, 1987). The family lived in Denver, Colorado, in a home left to Chapman by his grandfather Mike, along with Duane Lee and Leland. According to Chapman's daughter Lyssa, she and her siblings reportedly endured a hard childhood, with incidents of sexual abuse and substance abuse plaguing the family. His fourth marriage was to Tawny Marie Chapman. The two met in 1988, after Chapman arrested her on a drug possession charge, and she subsequently became his secretary. The two married in 1992 and separated in 1994, officially divorcing in 2002. The two had no children together, though Chapman's children did refer to her as their mother during the two's relationship. In his autobiography, You Can Run But You Can't Hide, Chapman referred to the marriage as \\"a disaster from the start,\\" alleging she was addicted to amphetamines. His fifth marriage was to Alice Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Barmore (), with whom he had an on-again-off-again relationship until the two married on May 20, 2006, at a Hilton hotel in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii. They had two children together, Bonnie Joanne Chapman (December 16, 1998) and Garry Chapman (February 7, 2001), and Chapman adopted Beth's daughter by her ex-husband, Cecily Barmore-Chapman (June 19, 1993). Chapman was also able to help Beth locate and reconcile with her son, Dominic Davis (born 1985), who was born to her when she was a teenager. Dog and Beth operated Da'Kine Bail Bonds together. Beth died on June 26, 2019, in Hawaii, as a result of throat cancer. She had been diagnosed with the disease in 2017 and underwent a 13-hour surgery to have a tumor removed. The family appeared in an A&E; series titled Dog and Beth: Fight of Their Lives, to chronicle the experience. Chapman has one child out of wedlock, his eldest child Christopher Michael Hecht (July, 1969), who was born to his ex- girlfriend, Debbie White, while he was serving an 18-month prison sentence. Debbie kept her pregnancy from Chapman and committed suicide in 1978, leading the boy to be adopted by Keith and Gloria Hecht. Hecht has reportedly struggled with drug and alcohol addiction since at least 1991 and has a lengthy criminal history, including a history of hate crimes.

The plot of 8-Bit Theater is loosely based on that of the video game Final Fantasy, in which four adventurers, the Light Warriors, must save the world by defeating four powerful demons that represent the four elements, thus relighting four magical orbs tied to the same elements, and, finally, defeating the personification of evil, Chaos. However, while many of the original plot points and the name of the characters are present, the way they come about is often radically different. The Light Warriors themselves tend to cause far more harm than good on their travels and mostly have to be blackmailed, bribed, or threatened into accepting quests. The comic is also not a serious epic; the protagonists and many of the supporting characters are based on and a parody of exaggerated role-playing video game stereotypes to the point where many characters are actually named after their character classes, and much of the humor displayed in 8-Bit Theater is derived from the ineptitude of characters as well as from the interactions between four protagonists who are travelling together but do not actually like each other very much. The range of comedic devices 8-Bit Theater employs includes droll humor, running gags, word play, and slapstick, and another significant portion of the humor results from creating reader anticipation for dramatic moments which fail to come. Clevinger has stated that \\"[his] favorite comics are the ones where the joke is on the reader.\\" Creation 8-Bit Theater was originally intended to parody a variety of classic 8-bit video games, like Metroid or River City Ransom. The popularity of the Final Fantasy manga convinced Clevinger to abandon this idea. However, 8-Bit Theater does contain occasional references to other video games as well as comic books, television shows and movies, such as thinly veiled superhero parodies Arachna-Dude and The Sulk. As a sprite comic, much of the art in 8-Bit Theater is sampled from video games, particularly Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy III. Some art is also obtained from public clip art sites and unspecified Google image search results. Original artwork is created by Lydia Tyree and Kevin Sigmund, who contribute hand drawn art and custom sprites respectively. The comic itself is assembled by Clevinger in Adobe Photoshop. The epilogue of 8-Bit Theater was hand drawn by Matt Speroni.  Characters  Final Fantasy allowed players to pick their own four-person party from six character classes and name them individually. 8-Bit Theater features six characters that each represent one of the six classes; four of these characters make up the comic's protagonists, the Light Warriors. = The Light Warriors = The Light Warriors, riding blue Chocobos. From left to right: Red Mage, Thief, Black Mage and Fighter. * Black Mage ‚Äî A wizard who is highly proficient in black magic and makes an active effort to be as evil as possible. * Fighter ‚Äî A warrior who is extremely skilled in swordfighting, but also na√Øve and childlike. * Thief ‚Äî Thief, also known as the Prince of Elfland, employs trickery and argumentation in his pursuit of money. His biggest motivation is greed. * Red Mage ‚Äî Red Mage is versatile almost to the point of obsession and firmly believes that the world is a tabletop role-playing game. He is quite knowledgeable, but also completely delusional. = Other notable characters = * White Mage ‚Äî A priestess specializing in white (healing) magic. White Mage was assigned by her order to protect fate and to help the Light Warriors save the world. She discreetly follows the Light Warriors around the world for a lengthy portion of the comic to achieve this goal. * Black Belt ‚Äî A talented martial artist and travelling companion of White Mage. Black Belt had an extremely poor sense of direction, to the effect that the laws of physics and spacetime tended to rearrange themselves around him. He was killed by the Fiend Kary in the course of the series. * Sarda the Sage ‚Äî An omnipotent wizard who forces the Light Warriors to retrieve the four elemental orbs. He claims to be \\"The Wizard Who Did It\\" and uses his powers in an immensely irresponsible and careless manner. * The Dark Warriors ‚Äî A group of villains based on minor enemies from the game. They consist of Garland, Bikke the Pirate, Drizz'l the Dark Elf Prince, and Vilbert Von Vampire. They plot the downfall of the Light Warriors, but are depicted as even more inept than the Light Warriors themselves. * The Four Fiends ‚Äî Powerful elemental beings that guard their respective elemental orbs. They are Lich, Kary, Ur, and Muffin. They were individually killed by the Light Warriors, and then, following their resurrection as a group, killed by Black Mage.  Plot  8-Bit Theater opens with an introductory sequence that explains how the Light Warriors initially meet and decide to form an adventuring party in the kingdom of Corneria, where King Steve's daughter, Princess Sara, is being held captive by the knight Garland in the nearby Temple of Fiends. After her rescue, during which both the Light Warriors and Garland himself are shown as so incompetent that Sara has to orchestrate her kidnapping and rescue herself, the king has a bridge built that connects Corneria to the main continent. Here the Light Warriors meet the witch Matoya, who blackmails them into recovering her stolen crystal. In the port town of Pravoka the party defeats the pirate Bikke (accompanied by Garland) and uses his ship to travel on to Elfland. There, they discover the King has been poisoned, apparently by the same person who stole Matoya's crystal, and Thief is the prince of Elfland. The Light Warriors retrieve the antidote and Matoya's crystal from the dark elf Drizz'l, who is shortly thereafter recruited by Garland and Bikke. Upon his recovery, the Elf King sends the Light Warriors to save Elfland by retrieving the Earth Orb from two undead beings, Vilbert von Vampire and his father Lich, the Fiend of Earth. Vilbert survives the battle and is later recruited into Garland's Dark Warriors, while Lich goes to hell. White Mage then sends the Light Warriors to meet Sarda the Sage, an omnipotent wizard who takes the Earth orb and proceeds to draft the group into quests for the other three elemental orbs. The Fire Orb is held by Kary, the Fiend of Fire in Gurgu Volcano, who kills Black Belt before the group can defeat her and retrieve the orb. A subsequent side quest to the Ice Cave on Sarda's behalf, during which the Light Warriors encounter squid-like Doom Cultists, is ultimately fruitless. A second side quest, however, involves the Light Warriors meeting the dragon god-king Bahamut, who sends them to the Castle of Ordeals to obtain a rat tail. There, the Light Warriors each face their own internal demons: Sloth (Fighter), Pride (Red Mage), Greed (Thief) and a doppelg√§nger of Black Mage, who is the only thing that can represent his evil. The Light Warriors present the rat tail to Bahamut, only to find that it is an ingredient in a virility soup his girlfriend Matoya makes for him. The party is rewarded with class upgrades: Red Mage becomes a Mime, Fighter becomes a Knight, Thief becomes a Ninja, and Black Mage becomes a Blue Mage with some help from a Dark God. Returning to the task of retrieving the elemental orbs, the Light Warriors travel to the cities of Gaia and Onrac and use a submarine provided by Sarda to reach the Sea Shrine, where they meet the Doom Cultists a second time. After defeating them, they accidentally summon the third Fiend, Ur (known in the game as Kraken). The Light Warriors kill Ur, retrieve the Water Orb and travel on to Lefein in search of the Air Orb, where they meet Dragoon, the last Dragon Knight, and the evil dragon Muffin, the fourth Fiend, who guards the Orb of Air. During a battle in Muffin's Sky Castle she is killed by Dragoon. The Sky Castle itself explodes after Fighter and Black Mage take the Air Orb. Upon presenting the final orb to Sarda, he dismissively orders the Light Warriors to return to the Temple of Fiends, where they find that the Dark Warriors have made the temple their base of operations. During the night, Drizz'l summons the Four Fiends from Hell and has them confront the Light Warriors. Black Mage, using evil energy he absorbed from his doppelg√§nger, kills the fiends, absorbs their evil energies as well and turns on the other Light Warriors. Sarda interrupts the fight and reveals his intent to destroy the Light Warriors himself. Sarda explains himself to be the grown-up version of a child that suffered great harm as a result of the Light Warrior's actions around the world. Young Sarda became so focused on revenge that he studied to be a great wizard and travelled back in time to the beginning of the universe to remake it without the Light Warriors; after discovering that changing the past was impossible even for him, he decides to settle for making the Light Warriors into the warriors of legend, for no other reason than to further humiliate them in defeat. Sarda absorbs the orbs' magic energy as well as Black Mage's evil energy and easily unmakes not only the Light Warriors' class changes, but also removes their original abilities. Sarda's power quickly becomes erratic and unstable, and Chaos, the King of Demons, takes the opportunity to possess Sarda's body and announce his plans to annihilate the universe. However, before a final battle between the Light Warriors and Chaos can begin, he is destroyed off-panel by a group of four White Mages, a party combination that was dismissed in one of the earliest episodes as ineffectual for the game, and all credit for saving the world goes to a group of bystanders, the Dark Warriors. The Epilogue picks up three years later. White Mage visits Red Mage and Dragoon at a restaurant, where they have started up an extremely unsuccessful support group for sole survivors of ancient sects. Afterward, White Mage visits King Thief in Elfland, who has been trying to locate Black Mage and Fighter, in an effort to obtain more riches from their adventure. Black Mage and Fighter find themselves poor and out of work in a remote town, trying to make money by taking job postings in the town square. The epilogue ends with Fighter suggesting that they resume their search for the \\"Armor of Invincibility\\" that Fighter has been searching for since the beginning of the comic.

Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re- engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products. The software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software, such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product. System software underlies applications and the programming process itself, and is often developed separately. The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development. There are many approaches to software project management, known as software development life cycle models, methodologies, processes, or models. The waterfall model is a traditional version, contrasted with the more recent innovation of agile software development. Methodologies A software development process (also known as a software development methodology, model, or life cycle) is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing information systems. A wide variety of such frameworks has evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. There are several different approaches to software development: some take a more structured, engineering-based approach to develop software, whereas others may take a more incremental approach, where software evolves as it is developed piece-by-piece. One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodologies is best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.System Development Methodologies for Web- Enabled E-Business: A Customization Framework Linda V. Knight (DePaul University, USA), Theresa A. Steinbach (DePaul University, USA) and Vince Kellen (Blue Wolf, USA) Most methodologies share some combination of the following stages of software development: * Analyzing the problem * Market research * Gathering requirements for the proposed software * Devising a plan or design for the software * Implementation (coding) of the software * Testing the software * Deployment * Maintenance and bug fixing These stages are often referred to collectively as the software development life-cycle, or SDLC. Different approaches to software development may carry out these stages in different orders, or devote more or less time to different stages. The level of detail of the documentation produced at each stage of software development may also vary. These stages may also be carried out in turn (a ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù based approach), or they may be repeated over various cycles or iterations (a more \\"extreme\\" approach). The more extreme approach usually involves less time spent on planning and documentation, and more time spent on coding and development of automated tests. More ‚Äúextreme‚Äù approaches also promote continuous testing throughout the development life-cycle, as well as having a working (or bug-free) product at all times. More structured or ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù based approaches attempt to assess the majority of risks and develop a detailed plan for the software before implementation (coding) begins, and avoid significant design changes and re-coding in later stages of the software development life-cycle planning. There are significant advantages and disadvantages to the various methodologies, and the best approach to solving a problem using software will often depend on the type of problem. If the problem is well understood and work can be effectively planned out ahead of time, the more \\"waterfall\\" based approach may work the best. If, on the other hand, the problem is unique (at least to the development team) and the structure of the software cannot be easily envisioned, then a more \\"extreme\\" incremental approach may work best. Software development activities =Identification of need= The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, for fit with existing channels distribution, for possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and for fit with the company's marketing objectives. In a marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. A decision is reached early in the first phase as to whether, based on the more detailed information generated by the marketing and development staff, the project should be pursued further.Joseph M. Morris (2001). Software Industry Accounting. p.1.10 In the book \\"Great Software Debates\\", Alan M. Davis states in the chapter \\"Requirements\\", sub-chapter \\"The Missing Piece of Software Development\\" > Students of engineering learn engineering and are rarely exposed to finance > or marketing. Students of marketing learn marketing and are rarely exposed > to finance or engineering. Most of us become specialists in just one area. > To complicate matters, few of us meet interdisciplinary people in the > workforce, so there are few roles to mimic. Yet, software product planning > is critical to the development success and absolutely requires knowledge of > multiple disciplines.Alan M. Davis. Great Software Debates (October 8, > 2004), pp:125-128 Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press Because software development may involve compromising or going beyond what is required by the client, a software development project may stray into less technical concerns such as human resources, risk management, intellectual property, budgeting, crisis management, etc. These processes may also cause the role of business development to overlap with software development. =Planning process= Planning is an objective of each and every activity, where we want to discover things that belong to the project. An important task in creating a software program is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis.Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., Mylopoulos, J., and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136 Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result but do not know what software should do. Skilled and experienced software engineers recognize incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements at this point. Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect. \\"Although much effort is put in the requirements phase to ensure that requirements are complete and consistent, rarely that is the case; leaving the software design phase as the most influential one when it comes to minimizing the effects of new or changing requirements. Requirements volatility is challenging because they impact future or already going development efforts.\\" Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and clearly stated. This is often called a scope document. =Designing= Once the requirements are established, the design of the software can be established in a software design document. This involves a preliminary or high-level design of the main modules with an overall picture (such as a block diagram) of how the parts fit together. The language, operating system, and hardware components should all be known at this time. Then a detailed or low-level design is created, perhaps with prototyping as proof-of-concept or to firm up requirements. =Implementation, testing and documenting= Implementation is the part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the project. Software testing is an integral and important phase of the software development process. This part of the process ensures that defects are recognized as soon as possible. In some processes, generally known as test-driven development, tests may be developed just before implementation and serve as a guide for the implementation's correctness. Documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. This may also include the writing of an API, be it external or internal. The software engineering process chosen by the developing team will determine how much internal documentation (if any) is necessary. Plan-driven models (e.g., Waterfall) generally produce more documentation than Agile models. =Deployment and maintenance= Deployment starts directly after the code is appropriately tested, approved for release, and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment. This may involve installation, customization (such as by setting parameters to the customer's values), testing, and possibly an extended period of evaluation. Software training and support is important, as software is only effective if it is used correctly. Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered faults or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software. . In most cases maintenance is required on regular basis to fix reported issues and keep the software running. Subtopics =View model= The TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives. A view model is a framework that provides the viewpoints on the system and its environment, to be used in the software development process. It is a graphical representation of the underlying semantics of a view. The purpose of viewpoints and views is to enable human engineers to comprehend very complex systems and to organize the elements of the problem around domains of expertise. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). Concepts for Automating Systems Integration NIST 2003. Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no one individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system's specifications. A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system. These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in some set of aspects of the system. Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint. =Business process and data modelling= Graphical representation of the current state of information provides a very effective means for presenting information to both users and system developers. example of the interaction between business process and data models. * A business model illustrates the functions associated with the business process being modeled and the organizations that perform these functions. By depicting activities and information flows, a foundation is created to visualize, define, understand, and validate the nature of a process. * A data model provides the details of information to be stored and is of primary use when the final product is the generation of computer software code for an application or the preparation of a functional specification to aid a computer software make-or-buy decision. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process and data models.Paul R. Smith & Richard Sarfaty (1993). Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools. Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group. Usually, a model is created after conducting an interview, referred to as business analysis. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions designed to extract required information that describes a process. The interviewer is called a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants who provide the information. The facilitator should have some knowledge of the process of interest, but this is not as important as having a structured methodology by which the questions are asked of the process expert. The methodology is important because usually a team of facilitators is collecting information across the facility and the results of the information from all the interviewers must fit together once completed. The models are developed as defining either the current state of the process, in which case the final product is called the \\"as-is\\" snapshot model, or a collection of ideas of what the process should contain, resulting in a \\"what-can-be\\" model. Generation of process and data models can be used to determine if the existing processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications or enhancements, or if re-engineering is required as a corrective action. The creation of business models is more than a way to view or automate your information process. Analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way your business or organization conducts its operations. =Computer-aided software engineering= Computer-aided software engineering (CASE), in the field software engineering, is the scientific application of a set of software tools and methods to the development of software which results in high- quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.Kuhn, D.L (1989). \\"Selecting and effectively using a computer-aided software engineering tool\\". Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6-7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (USA); DOE Project. It also refers to methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). System Requirements Engineering. McGraw-Hill. The term \\"computer-aided software engineering\\" (CASE) can refer to the software used for the automated development of systems software, i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired programming language.CASE definition In: Telecom Glossary 2000 . Retrieved 26 Oct 2008. Two key ideas of Computer-aided Software System Engineering (CASE) are:K. Robinson (1992). Putting the Software Engineering into CASE. New York : John Wiley and Sons Inc. * Foster computer assistance in software development and software maintenance processes, and * An engineering approach to software development and maintenance. Typical CASE tools exist for configuration management, data modeling, model transformation, refactoring, source code generation. =Integrated development environment= Anjuta, a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment An integrated development environment (IDE) also known as integrated design environment or integrated debugging environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a: *Source code editor, *Compiler or interpreter, *Build automation tools, and *Debugger (usually). IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces. Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific programming language, so as to provide a feature set which most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. =Modeling language= A modeling language is any artificial language that can be used to express information or knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure. A modeling language can be graphical or textual.Xiao He (2007). \\"A metamodel for the notation of graphical modeling languages\\". In: Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2007. COMPSAC 2007 ‚Äì Vol. 1. 31st Annual International, Volume 1, Issue, 24‚Äì27 July 2007, pp 219-224. Graphical modeling languages use a diagram techniques with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and that represent relationships and various other graphical annotation to represent constraints. Textual modeling languages typically use standardised keywords accompanied by parameters to make computer-interpretable expressions. Examples of graphical modelling languages in the field of software engineering are: *Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN, and the XML form BPML) is an example of a process modeling language. *EXPRESS and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose data modeling language. *Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across layers. *Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process, *Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems. *IDEF is a family of modeling languages, the most notable of which include IDEF0 for functional modeling, IDEF1X for information modeling, and IDEF5 for modeling ontologies. *LePUS3 is an object-oriented visual Design Description Language and a formal specification language that is suitable primarily for modelling large object-oriented (Java, C++, C#) programs and design patterns. *Specification and Description Language (SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems. *Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques and has widespread tool support. Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, using them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer needed. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more difficult problems, such as parallel computing and distributed systems. =Programming paradigm= A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, which is not generally dictated by the project management methodology (such as waterfall or agile). Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program (such as objects, functions, variables, constraints) and the steps that comprise a computation (such as assignations, evaluation, continuations, data flows). Sometimes the concepts asserted by the paradigm are utilized cooperatively in high-level system architecture design; in other cases, the programming paradigm's scope is limited to the internal structure of a particular program or module. A programming language can support multiple paradigms. For example, programs written in C++ or Object Pascal can be purely procedural, or purely object-oriented, or contain elements of both paradigms. Software designers and programmers decide how to use those paradigm elements. In object-oriented programming, programmers can think of a program as a collection of interacting objects, while in functional programming a program can be thought of as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, process-oriented programming allows programmers to think about applications as sets of concurrent processes acting upon logically shared data structures. Just as different groups in software engineering advocate different methodologies, different programming languages advocate different programming paradigms. Some languages are designed to support one paradigm (Smalltalk supports object-oriented programming, Haskell supports functional programming), while other programming languages support multiple paradigms (such as Object Pascal, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Common Lisp, Scheme, Python, Ruby, and Oz). Many programming paradigms are as well known for what methods they forbid as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming forbids using side-effects; structured programming forbids using goto statements. Partly for this reason, new paradigms are often regarded as doctrinaire or overly rigid by those accustomed to earlier styles. Avoiding certain methods can make it easier to prove theorems about a program's correctness, or simply to understand its behavior. Examples of high-level paradigms include: *Aspect-oriented software development *Domain-specific modeling *Model-driven engineering *Object-oriented programming methodologies **Grady Booch's object-oriented design (OOD), also known as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The Booch model includes six diagrams: class, object, state transition, interaction, module, and process. *Search-based software engineering *Service-oriented modeling *Structured programming *Top- down and bottom-up design **Top-down programming: evolved in the 1970s by IBM researcher Harlan Mills (and Niklaus Wirth) in developed structured programming. =Software reuse= A definition of software reuse is the process of creating software from predefined software components. A software reuse approach seeks to increase or maximise the use of existing software artefacts in the software development lifecycle. The following are some common software reuse methods: * A software framework is a reusable design or implementation for a software system or subsystem. * Component-based software engineering involves integrating together existing components to create an application. * Service-oriented architectures or service-oriented programming builds upon the concept of components to provide networked services, such as web services. * Software product lines seek to develop software based upon a common set of 'core' assets and process, in order to produce a range of products (or 'applications') for a particular market. * API (Application programming interface, establish a set of \\"subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software\\" which can be utilised in future builds. * Open Source documentations, via libraries such as GitHub, provide free code for software developers to re-use and implement into new applications or designs.

In 2003 he was convicted of multiple sexual assaults using the date-rape drug GHB. Early life Andrew Luster is the son of Henry Luster, a psychiatrist, and Elizabeth Luster (n√©e Shore). His mother was the adopted daughter of Max Factor, Sr.'s daughter Freda. He grew up in Malibu, California, and attended Windward School in Los Angeles. After graduating, Luster moved to Mussel Shoals, California, living on a $1 million trust fund and living in a $600,000 cottage on the beach. According to the Los Angeles Times, this move and Luster's \\"freewheeling lifestyle\\" weakened his \\"already tenuous\\" ties to the Factor family, which was heavily involved in the arts and philanthropy. Sexual assault charges and conviction In 2000, Luster was arrested when a student at a local college told police that she had been raped at Luster's home. Upon investigation, police charged Luster with drugging three women with the date-rape drug GHB, sexually assaulting them, and video-taping the assaults, having found videotapes of the assaults when they searched his home. After paying $1 million bail, Luster failed to appear in court to defend himself against the charges in January 2003. Luster was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 124 years in prison. Luster's legal case earned major attention due to his family's wealth, and in January 2003 the FBI issued a warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution.In Re Grand Jury Transcripts in The Matter of the Investigation of Andrew Luster's Flight to Avoid Prosecution In June 2003, he was captured by American bounty hunter Duane \\"Dog\\" Chapman in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Both Luster and Chapman were subsequently arrested by Mexican police. Luster was handed over to American authorities. Chapman's felony kidnapping charge was reduced to a misdemeanor, and his lawyer advised him to flee Mexico when he was released on bail. Chapman later wrote that he believed his actions in Mexico were legal due to working closely with a Mexican police officer while in that nation, but the American judge in Luster's case refused to grant Chapman any reward or bond. Chapman also explained that during his pursuit of Luster, he consulted with \\"a forensic expert who specialized in sex crimes\\" who believed Luster's preference for raping unconscious, passive victims indicated a necrophile tendency that might lead to murder. The California Court of Appeal refused Luster's appeal, citing that Luster had been a fugitive. Longstanding precedent holds that fugitives flout the court's authority, and thus forfeit their right to appeal. The California Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court later refused to overturn this ruling.[ Supreme Court of the United States Docket for 03-854, Andrew Stuart v. California] December 11, 2003Record of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal at FindLaw Prison sentence and civil suits Luster is currently incarcerated at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, California. Under California law, since his crimes harmed other persons, he is required to serve at least 85% of his sentence before becoming eligible for release with time off with good behavior. Had his original sentence stood, Luster would not have even been considered for release until he served 105 years‚Äîeffectively a life sentence. In late 2009, Luster filed a petition for habeas corpus as the final possibility of having his case reviewed by another court on appeal. Luster was represented in that suit by Jay Leiderman and J. David Nick. The habeas corpus petition was granted in April 2012. On March 11, 2013, the Ventura County Superior Court vacated Luster's 124-year sentence but not his conviction, based on the trial judge's failure to state specific reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, and ordered a new sentencing hearing April 4, 2013. On April 16, 2013, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Stoltz reduced Luster's sentence to 50 years‚Äî48 years for the rapes and two years for the drug-related charges. Luster's lawyers have indicated there will be an appeal. In 2016, opponents of California Proposition 57 released a brochure that stated that Luster could be released early due to the lack of clarity for what defines \\"violent crimes.\\" In response to this brochure, California Governor Jerry Brown told Fresno County sheriff Margaret Mims that Luster was originally sentenced to 100 years in prison and was a registered sex offender, \\"and on both accounts would not be getting out.\\" Brown's administration later clarified that since Luster would have to register as a sex offender, he would not be eligible for parole even if Proposition 57 passed. Two of the victims won civil lawsuits against Luster, who was ordered to pay a total of $40 million. Luster subsequently sold most of his property and declared bankruptcy.  Media portrayals  After Luster fled the United States, a movie based on his crimes, A Date with Darkness: The Trial and Capture of Andrew Luster was produced with the intention of aiding in his capture by ending with a photo of him, and a request for witnesses to his whereabouts to notify authorities. Because the film was in production when Luster was captured, the ending was re-written to incorporate his capture. On August 28, 2009, the true crime TV Series Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice aired an episode on the case in Season 3, Episode 4, \\"Evil Deeds\\". On August 31, 2017, Investigation Discovery aired the first episode of Guilty Rich, which recounted the story of Andrew Luster's crimes, arrest, flight, and ultimate conviction and incarceration.

The company primarily imports and localizes foreign language German-style board games. History In 1995, Jay Tummelson began working for Mayfair Games. At that time, Mayfair had begun to import German-style board games for sale, without doing any localization. Tummelson first suggested that they incorporate an English translation, and then that they completely localize the game for American audiences. Tummelson acquired the rights for Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix, Manhattan, Modern Art, Streetcar, and The Settlers of Catan, which were published together in 1996. One part of the localization process was to create original art and components. Tummelson thought that a better solution would be to use the same artwork and components as the originals and to share the cost of printing with the European publishers, as well. In 1998, he founded Rio Grande Games to take that approach. Since then, Rio Grande Games has published over 350 games and has had a significant effect on board gaming in the United States. The most popular of the games published by Rio Grande Games are Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Dominion, Power Grid, Race for the Galaxy, Bohnanza, and Lost Cities. More recently, Rio Grande Games has begun publishing its own games and has even begun licensing its games to partners in other countries wanting to localize the games in their local languages. Thus, Race for the Galaxy will soon be seen in Chinese, Korean, and others, as well as its original English, French, and German.

It is located on Lake Erie, at the southern end of the Welland Canal, in the Niagara Region of Southern Ontario. The original settlement, known as Gravelly Bay, dates from 1832 and was renamed after Sir John Colborne, a British war hero and the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada at the time of the opening of the (new) southern terminus of the First Welland Canal in 1833. History In pre-colonial times, Indigenous people of the Onguiaahra (Neutral Iroquois) lived in the area, due in part to the ready availability of flint and chert from outcroppings on the Onondaga Escarpment. This advantage was diminished by the introduction of firearms by European traders, and they were driven out by the Six Nations of the Iroquois around 1650 as part of the Beaver Wars. Originally called Gravelly Bay, after the shallow, bedrock-floored bay upon which it sits, today's City of Port Colborne traces its roots back to the United Empire Loyalist settlements that grew up in the area following the American Revolution. Growth became focused around the southern terminus of the Welland Canal after it reached Lake Erie in 1833. The town was the location of the Port Colborne explosion, a grain elevator explosion in 1919 that killed 10 and injured 16. As the population rose, Welland County was formed in 1845 from Lincoln County and Port Colborne was incorporated as a village in 1870, became a town in 1918, merged with the neighbouring Village of Humberstone in 1952, and was re-incorporated as a city in 1966. In 1970, Niagara Region municipal restructuring added Humberstone Township, further expanding the city. In the year 1888, American tourists from the Southern states began building vacation homes on the lakeshore of the Western edge of the town. By 1890, an entire gated community of vacationers from the US South called Port Colborne their home during the summer months, naming the community The Humberstone Club. Over 30 grand summer homes, along with a variety of clubhouses and service buildings, were built along the lake in the following years, many of which still stand today on historic Tennessee Avenue. The southern architecture and style of these buildings would influence the design and construction of other historic buildings in the area. During the American Civil War, Varina Davis, wife of Confederacy President Jefferson Davis, spent three years in the relative comfort and safety of the community. Port Colborne was one of the hardest hit communities during the Blizzard of 1977. Thousands of people were stranded when the city was paralyzed during the storm, and the incident remains one of significance to the local population. =Environmental concerns= Emissions from Inco's base metal refinery, closed in 1984, resulted in soils contaminated with concentrations of nickel, copper and cobalt above the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's \\"soil remediation criteria.\\"Government of Ontario, Canada / Gouvernement de l'Ontario, Canada However, two studies, one in 1997 and another in 1999 found \\"[no] adverse health effects which may have resulted from environmental exposures.\\" After a series of public meetings between the City, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and Inco, it was decided to perform a Community-Based Risk Assessment, a process designed to determine whether the contamination poses a threat to the current, past, or future residents of Port Colborne, and what Inco must do to clean up the contaminated areas. Some residents launched a Class-Action Lawsuit against Inco in 2001 seeking $750 million in damages to health, property value, and quality-of-life. Although this suit failed to be certified in 2002, it was subsequently modified to limit the class, and focus solely on devaluation of propertyhazmatmag summary as at February 2004 and was certified on appeal on November 18, 2005. A timeline of the case has been written from the point of view of the plaintiffs. On July 6, 2010, the Ontario Supreme Court sided with the residents and awarded more than 7,000 households in Port Colborne a total of $36 million. Households in the Rodney Street area, in the shadow of the nickel refinery, were each awarded $23,000 while those living on the east and west sides of Port Colborne were each awarded $9,000 and $2,500 respectively. Vale appealed the ruling to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which found in 2010 that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence of economic harm, raising the legal burden of proof but not invalidating Rylands v Fletcher as precedent law. In April 2012 the Supreme Court of Canada sided with Vale and denied the residents the awarded compensation. Court costs in the amount of CAD$1,766,000 were awarded the defendant by Henderson, J.

Like other cities in the region, Port Colborne was a heavily industrial city throughout most of the early 20th century. A grain elevator, two modern flour mills, a Vale nickel refinery, a cement plant operated by Port Colborne Canada Cement, and a blast furnace operated by Algoma Steel were all major employers. As recently as 2017, Port Colborne has been successful attracting new industry, such as the agro- business operations of Casco Inc. and Jungbunzlauer, which process corn into products such as sweeteners and citric acid. The International Nickel Company (now Vale) has long been one of the city's main employers, since the opening of a refinery in 1918. Taking advantage of inexpensive hydroelectricity from generating stations at nearby Niagara Falls, the refinery produced electro- refined nickel for the war effort, and grew to employ over 2,000 workers by the 1950s. Cutbacks in operations and increasing factory automation have reduced the workforce to its present-day (2018) total of 170. Marine Recycling Corporation is a ship recycling firm, boasting of Green (environmentally friendly) services, located next to the Welland Canal at Gravelly Bay and operating since the 1970s. A 2012 report indicates the following as the largest private sector employers, with a staff of over 50, in Port Colborne at that time: * Port Colborne Poultry (Pinty's Delicious Foods), 229 employees * Vale Canada Limited, 200 * J.

Originating as a small fair held at the Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum, it has grown to feature live music, an antique car show, fireworks, tall ships, a kite festival, and international foods. The festival also highlights Lock 8, which at , is one of the world's longest canal locks. Lock 8 keeps the water level on the Welland Canal constant independent of weather on Lake Erie. Hence the ships are only raised or lowered one to four feet depending on the current water level in Lake Erie. Much of the festival centres around West St., which runs parallel to the canal, and offers a view of the Clarence St. Bridge, built in 1929, it is one of only three remaining lift bridges on the canal today. The Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum, located near the centre of town, is a resource for local history and archival research. In addition to a collection of historic buildings and artifacts, it opened the \\"Marie Semley Research Wing\\" to foster research into local history, named to commemorate the long-standing efforts of a local resident who devoted hours to the museum. The community features theatre venues with the professional Showboat Festival Theatre and the amateur Port Colborne Operatic Society. The company has been presenting annual productions since its inception in 1945. The Port Colborne Lions Club, chartered in 1922, is one of the world's oldest Lions Clubs, and one of Canada's oldest service clubs in continuous operation. The club is still active within the community, hosting many yearly events including an annual Lions Club Carnival in the summer.

It is also known as the section symbol, section mark, double-s, or silcrow.  Use  Former logo of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Justice The section sign is often used when referring to a specific section of a legal code. For example, in Bluebook style, \\"Title 16 of the United States Code Section 580p\\" becomes \\"16 U.S.C. ¬ß 580p\\". The section sign is frequently used along with the pilcrow (¬∂) also known as the \\"paragraph sign\\", to reference a specific paragraph within a section of a document. While is usually read in spoken English as the word section, many other languages use the word \\"paragraph\\" exclusively to refer to a section of a document (especially of legal text), and use other words to describe a paragraph in the English sense. Consequently, in those cases it may be read as paragraph, and may occasionally be described as a \\"paragraph sign\\", but this is a description of its usage, not a formal name. When duplicated, as , it is read as the plural \\"sections\\". For example, \\"¬ß¬ß 13‚Äì21\\" would be read as \\"sections 13 through 21\\", much as (pages) is the plural of , meaning page. It may also be used with footnotes when asterisk , dagger , and double dagger have already been used on a given page. It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space so that the symbol is kept with the section number being cited. The section sign is itself sometimes a symbol of the justice system, in much the same way as the Rod of Asclepius is used to represent medicine. The Austrian Ministry of Justice used the symbol in its logo for a time. In Brazil, the sign may be used to represent numbered article paragraphs following the initial paragraph ().

Some scholars, however, are skeptical of this explanation. Others have theorized that it is an adaptation of the Ancient Greek (paragraphos), a catch-all term for a class of punctuation marks used by scribes with diverse shapes and intended uses.

Terminology Meteoriticists often use the term to represent stardust, grains that originated within a single star and which they extract from meteorites for study. Because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star, however, being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains, most presolar grains are also not stardust. Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust. This confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists who prefer to use the terms interchangeably, however, so both usages should employ or utilize the expression presolar stardust grains for stardust.

Turner (1964) Rare gases in the chondrite Renazzo, J. Geo. Phys. Res. 69, 3263-3281 were discovered to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites; their origin and the type of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a mass spectrometer, in order to count the relative abundance of the isotopes of the very small amount of noble gases trapped as inclusions. During the 1970s similar experiments discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes. Xenon has nine stable isotopes that differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons in their atomic nuclei. The mass spectrometer records the number of detected xenon atoms at atomic weights A=124, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134 and 136. By measuring these at several temperature steps in the heating of the sample it was demonstrated that trapped xenon had differing components within its total. It was speculated that one such component was xenon created when an unknown superheavy nucleus that was assumed to exist in the early Solar System underwent fission. Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud. A new theoretical framework for interpretation was advanced during the 1970s when Donald D. Clayton rejected the popular belief among meteoriticists that the solar system began as a uniform hot gas.D. D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Astrophys. H. 199, 765 (1975). Moon and Planets 19, 109-137 (1978) Instead he predicted that unusual but predictable isotopic compositions would be found within thermally condensed interstellar grains that had condensed during mass loss from stars of differing types. He argued that such grains exist throughout the interstellar medium.D.D. Clayton and R.A. Ward, s-process studies: xenon and krypton isotopic abundances, Astrophys. J. 224, 1000-1006 (1978). This paper was submitted in 1975 to Geochim. et Cosmochim Acta but was judged at that time to not be relevant to geochemistry. It was resubmitted to Astrophys J in 1978 after Edward Anders stated that he had discovered the pure s-process xenon gas in a bulk carbonaceous residue off a meteorite Clayton's first papers using that idea in 1975 pictured an interstellar medium populated with supernova grains that are rich in the radiogenic isotopes of Ne and Xe that had defined the extinct radioactivities.DD Clayton, Extinct radioactivities: trapped residuals of presolar grains, Astrophys. J. 199, 765 (1975); DD Clayton, 22Na, Ne-E, extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar, Nature 257, 36 (1975) Clayton defined several different types of stardust presolar grains likely to be discovered: stardust from red giant stars, sunocons (acronym from SUperNOva CONdensates) from supernovae, nebcons from nebular condensation by accretion of cold cloud gaseous atoms and molecules, and novacons from nova condensation. Despite vigorous and continuous active development of this picture, Clayton's suggestions lay unsupported by others for a decade until such grains were discovered within meteorites. The first unambiguous consequence of the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago,B. Srinivasan and E. Anders, Science 201, 51-56 (1978) who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant stardust. It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid- insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument. But the contemporary ion probes needed to be technologically much better.

Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in secondary ion mass spectrometry within the structural chemical elements of these grains.Ernst Zinner (1996) Stardust in the laboratory, Science 271:5245, 41-42 Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of stardust is therefore dated 1987. To measure the isotopic abundance ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic stardust grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized stardust grains within the meteorite's overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure isotopic abundance ratios within micron-sized grains. Ernst Zinner became the undisputed leader of SIMS applications to microscopic grains,A special issue of Meteoritics and Planetary Science 42, No. 7/8 (2007) documents Zinner's role in honor of his 70th birthday. Read especially its introductory article by Kevin McKeegan. earning him historic acclaim.Zinner died in 2015 at age 78. His obituary in February 2016 Physics Today by Donald Clayton tells more of Zinner's relationship to SIMS discoveries. Presolar grains of the Murchison meteorite In January 2020, analysis of the Murchison meteorite found in Australia in 1969 revealed stardust formed 5 to 7 billion years ago, older than Earth's 4.6 billion year-old sun, making the meteor and its stardust the oldest solid material ever discovered on Earth. In meteorites Presolar grains are the solid matter that was contained in the interstellar gas before the Sun formed. The stardust component can be identified in the laboratory by their abnormal isotopic abundances and consists of refractory minerals which survived the collapse of the solar nebula and the subsequent formation of planetesimals.Maria Lugaro (2005) Stardust from meteorites: An introduction to presolar grains (World Scientific, NY) To meteorite researchers, the term presolar grains has come to mean presolar grains found in meteorites, which consist overwhelmingly of stardust. Many other types of cosmic dust have not been detected in meteorites. Presolar stardust grains comprise only about 0.1 percent of the total mass of particulate matter found in meteorites. Such grains are isotopically-distinct material found in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, such as primitive chondrites. Their isotopic differences from the encasing meteorite require that they predate the Solar System. The crystallinity of those clusters ranges from micrometer-sized silicon carbide crystals (up to 1013 atoms), down to that of nanometer-sized diamond (about 1000 atoms), and unlayered graphene crystals of fewer than 100 atoms. The refractory grains achieved their mineral structures by condensing thermally within the slowly cooling expanding gases of supernovae and of red giant stars.  Characterization  Presolar grains are investigated using scanning or transmission electron microscopes (SEM/TEM), and mass spectrometric methods (noble gas mass spectrometry, resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, NanoSIMS)). Presolar grains that consist of diamonds are only a few nanometers in size and are, therefore, called nanodiamonds. Because of their small size, nanodiamonds are hard to investigate and, although they are among the first presolar grains discovered, relatively little is known about them. The typical sizes of other presolar grains are in the range of micrometers. Presolar grains consisting of the following minerals have so far been identified: *diamond (C) nanometer-sized grains (~ diameter)P. Fraundorf, G. Fraundorf, T. Bernatowicz, R. Lewis, and M.

Clayton and Larry R. Nittler (2004) Astrophysics with presolar stardust, Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics 42:39-78 Grains bearing the isotopic signature of \\"r-process\\" (rapid neutron capture) and alpha process (alpha capture) types of nucleosynthesis are useful in testing models of supernovae explosions. For example, some presolar grains (supernova grains) have very large excesses of calcium-44, a stable isotope of calcium which normally composes only 2% of the calcium abundance. The calcium in some presolar grains is composed primarily of 44Ca, which is presumably the remains of the extinct radionuclide titanium-44, a titanium isotope which is formed in abundance in Type II supernovae such as SN 1987A after rapid capture of four alpha particles by 28Si, after the process of silicon burning normally begins, and prior to the supernova explosion. However, 44Ti has a half-life of only 59 years, and thus it is soon converted entirely to 44Ca. Excesses of the decay products of the longer lived, but extinct, nuclides calcium-41 (half-life 99,400 years) and aluminium-26 (730,000 years) have also been detected in such grains. The rapid-process isotopic anomalies of these grains include relative excesses of nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 relative to Solar System abundances, as well as excesses of the neutron-rich stable nuclides 42Ca and 49Ti. page 139 Other presolar grains (AGB star grains) provide isotopic and physical information on asymptotic giant branch stars, which have manufactured the largest portion of the refractory elements lighter than iron in the galaxy. Because the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way, the set of collected particles further provides insight into galactic evolution prior to the formation of the Solar System. In addition to providing information on nucleosynthesis of the grain's elements, solid grains provide information on the physico-chemical conditions under which they condensed, and on events subsequent to their formation. For example, consider red giants ‚Äî which produce much of the carbon in our galaxy. Their atmospheres are cool enough for condensation processes to take place, resulting in the precipitation of solid particles (i.e., multiple atom agglomerations of elements such as carbon) in their atmosphere. This is unlike the atmosphere of the Sun, which is too hot to allow atoms to build up into more complex molecules. These solid fragments of matter are then injected into the interstellar medium by radiation pressure. Hence, particles bearing the signature of stellar nucleosynthesis provide information on (i) condensation processes in red giant atmospheres, (ii) radiation and heating processes in the interstellar medium, and (iii) the types of particles that carried the elements of which we are made, across the galaxy to our Solar System.
