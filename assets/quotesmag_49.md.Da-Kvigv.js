Boon participated on the writing of several Buzzcocks songs, using the pen name Alan Dial. Seeking to release the band's music, Boon started the New Hormones label. The label released the Spiral Scratch EP in January 1977, and began releasing records by other artists regularly from 1979 to 1982.

It aims to provide a cutting-edge lineup of eclectic and international films, many of which have appeared on the international film festival circuit and been championed in the magazine but have yet to gain distribution. The program first appeared as a one-off event in March 2000, organized by editor Richard T. Jameson and showcasing the most significant films and filmmakers of the past decade. Gavin Smith and Kent Jones added three New York premieres to the roster (Lars von Trier‚Äôs The Idiots, Manoel de Oliveira‚Äôs Inqui√©tude, Abbas Kiarostami‚Äôs The Wind Will Carry Us), and based on its success, it was revived in 2002, remaining an annual event at the Film Society of Lincoln Center ever since. In recent years, the program has extended its focus on little-seen international discoveries to also include avant-garde selections, retrospectives of overlooked or underrated artists, previews of films that are soon to be released, and conversations with directors and actors.

It is founded on the World Health Organization holistic definition of health, which says health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. America's Health Rankings is a partnership of the United Health Foundation, and the American Public Health Association. America's Health Rankings releases two yearly reports, one on the health of the general population in the 50 US states plus a senior report on the population aged 65 and older in each state. Both reports include some health metrics that are stratified by race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, place of residence, and economic status. State rankings are based on a methodology approved by a Scientific Advisory Committee. This methodology balances the contributions of health determinants‚Äîincluding 1) Behaviors; 2) Community and Environment; 3) Policy pertaining to our health care system, government, and numerous prevention programs; and 4) Clinical Care received‚Äîand Outcomes such as diabetes and deaths from cardiovascular disease. Purpose The ultimate purpose of the two reports is to improve the health of the US population by providing information that stimulates individuals, elected officials, health care professionals, public health professionals, employers, educators, and communities to act and create change. The publication of the rankings stimulates conversations concerning health in each state and across the nation. The fundamental conviction of America's Health Rankings is that each person in his or her capacity as an employee, employer, educator, student, voter, community volunteer, health care professional, public health professional, or elected official can contribute to the advancement of the health of his or her state. History America's Health Rankings was first published in 1990 and ranked the 50 US states using 16 health measures. The 2014 25th anniversary edition of the report used 27 Core Measures and 22 Supplemental Measures to evaluate the health of each state and the nation. America's Health Rankings Senior Report started in 2013 and used 34 Core Measures as well as five Supplemental Measures. =Scientific Advisory Committee= In 2002 United Health Foundation and the American Public Health Association commissioned the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health to do an ongoing review of America's Health Rankings. The Scientific Advisory Committee, currently led by Anna Schenck, PhD, MSPH, formed as a result and was charged with recommending improvements that maintain the value of the comparative, longitudinal information. Improvements also reflect the evolving role and science of public health as well as include adding and refining health measures as they become available and acceptable. The Scientific Advisory Committee includes representatives from local health departments, the American Public Health Association, current and former state health officers, and experts from many academic disciplines. =Measure selection= Four primary considerations drive the design of America's Health Rankings and the selection of each measure: # The overall rankings must represent a broad range of issues that affect a population's health. # Individual measures need to use common health-measurement criteria. # Data have to be available at a state level. # Data must be current and updated periodically. Components of health Americas Health Rankings includes in its model of health four groups of Determinants: # _Behaviors:_ Everyday activities that affect personal health habits as well as practices by individuals and families that affect personal health and the use of health resources. Behaviors can be modified especially when individuals are supported by the three other groups of Determinants below. # _Community and Environment:_ Daily conditions for living, working, shopping, exercising, etc., that affect achieving optimal health. # _Policy:_ Availability of resources to encourage and maintain health. Policy also influences the extent that public and health programs penetrate the general population. Policy measures can have a wide reach throughout a state, and they promote healthy living and judicious consumption of health care resources. # _Clinical Care:_ Access to as well as quality, appropriateness, and cost of care received at doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals. These four groups of measures influence health Outcomes of a state's population, and improving these Determinants will improve Outcomes. Most measures are a combination of activities in all four groups. For example, the prevalence of smoking is one of the Behaviors strongly influenced by the Community and Environment, by public Policy including taxation and restrictions on smoking in public places, and by Clinical Care received to treat the chemical and behavioral addictions associated with tobacco. Methodology America's Health Rankings employs a unique methodology developed and annually reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Committee, a panel of leading public health scholars. This methodology weighs and balances the contributions of factors such as smoking, obesity, binge drinking, high school graduation rates, children in poverty, access to care, and incidence of preventable disease to evaluate the health of a state's population. The report is based on data from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education and Labor; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the American Medical Association; the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Project; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Administration on Aging; the National Center for Health Statistics; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; National Federation to End Senior Hunger; the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; the Kaiser Family Foundation; Brown University; the American Geriatrics Society; the Commonwealth Fund; and the Trust for America's Health. The overall score for each state is calculated by adding the z scores of each measure multiplied by its percentage of total overall ranking (weight) and the effect (positively or negatively correlated) it has on health. Weights for individual metrics vary from 7.5% to 2.5%. The ranking is the ordering of each state according to value. Description of measures =2014 America‚Äôs Health Rankings= The measures used in the 2014 America's Health Rankings are in two subgroups: Core Measures and Supplemental Measures. Core Measures consist of health Determinants (risk factors), and health Outcomes. Determinants are actions that affect the population's future health, while Outcomes represent what has already occurred through death, disease, or missed days due to illness. There are four groups of Determinants: Behaviors, Community and Environment, Policy, and Clinical Care. The measures in these four groups influence a state's health Outcomes, and improving the Determinants over time will improve Outcomes. Supplemental Measures provide additional perspective on the health in a state. Supplemental Measures do not factor into a state's overall score and ranking, but they are useful in forming a fuller understanding of the health of a state.

Biography  Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Basia has said she was singing before she could speak. Music was always a passion for her throughout her childhood and teens, and she was always active in the art in whatever capacity she could be, in and out of school. After graduating from secondary school, Basia auditioned for an all- girl group called \\"Aphrodisia,\\" put together by Sky (Canadian band) founders, James Renald and Antoine Sicotte. She and three other girls were picked out of thousands of applicants, and went on to be briefly managed by the duo in Montreal, until management changed hands. The group were then flown to New York to record a 5-song demo, produced by The Berman Bros. of EuroSyndicate Productions. and it was around this time that Basia branched out on her own and began to pursue a career as a solo artist. =\\"Basia Lyjak\\"= After leaving Aphrodisia, Basia began to apply what she had learned from the experience to her songwriting and began collaboration and pre-production on her self-titled first album. The 6-song EP was released in 2002. Despite being proud of the milestone of her first album, Basia still wasn't certain that the songs represented where she wanted to be as an artist and songwriter. At this time she took a break from her solo project and joined a cover band called Wednesday Adams, where she continued to hone her voice by performing songs by artists like No Doubt, Veruca Salt (band), Tracy Bonham, Pat Benatar and Guns N' Roses, to name a few. =Writings on the Wall= In 2005, Basia began jamming and collaborating with just about anyone who was up for it, and the seeds for Writings on the Wall were planted. Pre-production began at Studio8 in Toronto, with longtime friend Jeff Iantorno, and eventually moved to DC Music, where the songs were recorded and produced by Bombay Doors bassist Andrew Lauzon. The EP was released on February 2, 2007, at Toronto's ElMocambo Tavern, at Basia's first headlining show since her Wednesday Adams days. =Don't Talk single= Basia released the single Don't Talk in 2008 as a follow-up to Writings on the Wall. The song, co-written with Kyle Riabko (currently starring in Spring Awakening), was recorded with producer Brian Moncarz, who has worked with artists like The Junction, Pilot Speed, .moneen. and more, and currently co-owns Rattlebox Studios with producer David Bottrill, whose credits include Tool, Silverchair and Mudvayne. A video was released for the song on March 14, 2009 during Basia's Canadian Music Week showcase. It was directed by Ryan M. Andrews of Blackguardism Creations, filmed by cinematographer Carl Elster of Forever Epic Films, visually designed by Stacey Laureyessens of theOriginalFace.ca and costumed by Mila Starr at Metal Star Fashion. =2009= Basia announced in April 2009 that she was awarded a FACTOR demo grant, resulting in the June 2009 single \\"What It Feels Like,\\" again co-written with her Don't Talk collaborator Kyle Riabko. In November 2009, she released another single, \\"Never Wanted Anything,\\" co- written with Norm Sabourin of Aqua Sound Studios. The track features a guitar solo by Sabourin, who also served as producer, and backing vocals by Toronto R&B;/soul star Kim Davis. In addition to these releases and gigging in Ontario, 2009 also saw Basi\\"a branch out into scoring for TV and video games. She, Ron and Dave can be heard on the theme song for the Down Under travel show, Jill & Stacey Do The Roo,\\" as well as the trailer for \\"The Game Cartel\\" video game. In December 2009, CanClone.ca released a rock mix of their Christmas song (originally recorded, but not released, in 2008), with Basia singing the track. =2010= While Basia released solo material at the tail end of 2009, she did not release any solo material in 2010. Instead, she lent her voice to a few other artists' projects. Basia can be heard on \\"Waiting,\\" a song for the troops written by Peter Haley. Two mixes of the song were released, with proceeds dedicated to the Wounded Warriors Fund. The track showcases a mournful, country side of Basia's range and timbre not widely heard in her own solo material. Following \\"Waiting,\\" Basia teamed up with R&B; artist Spoila Ranks for his track \\"Where Is The Love,\\" which also featured a slew of fellow Toronto talent. According to her website, Basia also spent several months away from her home in Toronto - she lived briefly in Calgary, Alberta to check out the west coast music scene, with support from Calgary Motor Coach, who supply tour buses to many major acts passing through Canada. In the fall of 2010, Basia received her second FACTOR grant. =2011= Over the course of the end of 2010 and until the early spring of 2011, Basia was recording with producer Steve Major at Wellesley Sound Studios, recording three tracks (\\"Sunshine,\\" \\"Hero\\" and \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah\\") made possible because of FACTOR's contribution. Basia also completed a fourth track called \\"Sick N' Tired\\" with former Nelly Furtado and Klooch member, Yurko Mychaluk. \\"Sunshine\\" was released in May 2011 and \\"Sick N' Tired\\" in August 2011. A video for \\"Hero\\" was shot with Karma Pictures and director of photography John Holosko in May 2011 for a winter 2011 release. Basia, as a solo artist, is backed by a series of leading Canadian musicians, including Ron Bechard (of Sin Dealer, Crash Karma, formerly of Edwin (musician) and Edwin & the Pressure, briefly of Three Days Grace) on guitars, Dave Carreiro (of Nigel's 11 with Chris Kirkpatrick) on bass, Dale Harrison (Headstones (band), Alannah Myles) on drums and multi-instrumentalist Pat Kelly on backing vocals and keyboards. Other present and past musicians who play for Lyjak include bassists and guitarists Darryl \\"Daz\\" Coppins, Andrew Lauzon, James Naro and Deacon Day and drummers Glenn Nash, Jeff Zurba, Chris Lesso.

Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra. Sergiev Posad, Russia. Among Eastern Orthodox and Eastern- Rite Catholic Christians, holy water is used frequently in rites of blessing and exorcism, and the water for baptism is always sanctified with a special blessing. Throughout the centuries, there have been many springs of water that have been believed by members of the Orthodox Church to be miraculous. Some still flow to this day, such as the one at Pochaev Lavra in Ukraine, and the Life-Giving Spring of the Theotokos in Constantinople (commemorated annually with the blessing of holy water on Bright Friday). Although Eastern Orthodox do not normally bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church like Catholics do, a quantity of holy water is typically kept in a font placed in the narthex (entrance) of the church, where it is available for anyone who would like to take some of it home with them. It is customary for Orthodox to drink holy water, to use it in their cooking and to sprinkle their houses with it. Often, when objects are blessed in the church (such as the palms on Palm Sunday, Icons or sacred vessels) the blessing is completed by a triple sprinkling with holy water using the words, \\"This (name of item) is blessed by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\\" Holy water is sometimes sprinkled on items or people when they are blessed outside the church building, as part of the prayers of blessing. In Russia, it is common for Orthodox Christians to bring newly bought cars to the church for blessing. Holy water is sprinkled inside and out, as well as under the hood. Similarly, in Alaska, the fishing boats are sprinkled with holy water at the start of the fishing season as the priest prays for the crews' safety and success. Some Catholics also have a priest bless their cars or homes with holy water as a way of invoking God's blessing and protection. Blessings Great Blessing of Waters (painting by Boris Kustodiev). Orthodox Christians most often bless themselves with holy water by drinking it. It is traditional to keep a quantity of it at home, and many Orthodox Christians will drink a small amount daily with their morning prayers. It may also be used for informal blessings when no clergy are present. For example, parents might bless their children with holy water before they leave the house for school or play. It is not unusual for pious Orthodox Christians to put a little holy water in their food as they cook their meals. It is also often taken with prayer in times of distress or temptation. There are two rites for blessing holy water: the Great Blessing of Waters which is held on the Feast of Theophany, and the Lesser Blessing of Waters which is conducted according to need during the rest of the year. Both forms are based upon the Rite of Baptism. Certain feast days call for the blessing of Holy Water as part of their liturgical observance. The use of holy water is based on the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist in the River Jordan, and the Orthodox interpretation of this event. In their view, John's baptism was a baptism of repentance, and the people came to have their sins washed away by the water. Since Jesus had no sin, but was God incarnate, his baptism had the effect not of washing away Jesus' sins, but of blessing the water, making it holy--and with it all of creation, so that it may be used fully for its original created purpose to be an instrument of life. Jesus' baptism is commemorated in the Eastern Orthodox churches at the Feast of Theophany (literally \\"manifestation of God\\") on January 6 (for those Orthodox Christians who use the Julian Calendar, January 6 falls on the Gregorian Calendar date of January 19). At the Vespers of this feast, a font of holy water is typically blessed in the church, to provide holy water for the parish's use in the coming year. The next morning, after the Divine Liturgy a procession goes from the church to a nearby river, lake or other body of water, to bless that water as well. This represents the redemption of all creation as part of humanity's salvation. In the following weeks, the priest typically visits the homes of the members of the parish and leads prayers of blessing for their families, homes (and even pets), sprinkling them with holy water. Again, this practice is meant to visibly represent God's sanctifying work in all parts of the people's lives.

Blessing the Waters of the Neva on Theophany (Today's Russia, Lankenau and Oelsnitz, Leipzig, 1876). Great Blessing of Waters on the Sanok river on the Day of Theophany. On the Great Feast of Theophany, holy water is blessed twice: at the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy on the eve of the feast, and on morning of the feast itself. After processing to the place where the vessel of water is prepared, to the singing of appropriate troparia (hymns) of the Theophany, there are a group of Scripture readings (, , , and ), culminating in the baptism account from the Gospel of Saint Mark () followed by the Great Litany. This is sung just as at the beginning of the Divine Liturgy, but with the following additional petitions which make clear what is being asked of God and what the use, purpose, and blessing of the water is believed to entail. > :That these waters may be sanctified by the power, and effectual operation, > and descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord. :That there may > descend upon these waters the cleansing operation of the super-substantial > Trinity, let us pray to the Lord. :That he will endue them with the grace of > redemption, the blessing of Jordan, the might, and operation, and descent of > the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord. :That Satan may speedily be > crushed under our feet, and that every evil counsel directed against us may > be brought to naught, let us pray to the Lord. :That the Lord our God will > free us from every attack and temptation of the enemy, and make us worthy of > the good things which he hath promised, let us pray to the Lord. :That he > will illumine us with the light of understanding and of piety, and with the > descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord. :That the Lord our God > will send down the blessing of Jordan, and sanctify these waters, let us > pray to the Lord. :That this water may be unto the bestowing of > sanctification; unto the remission of sins; unto the healing of soul and > body; and unto every expedient service, let us pray to the Lord. :That this > water may be a fountain welling forth unto life eternal, let us pray to the > Lord. :That it may manifest itself effectual unto the averting of every > machination of our foes, whether visible or invisible, let us pray to the > Lord. :For those who shall draw of it and take of it unto the sanctification > of their homes, let us pray to the Lord. :That it may be for the > purification of the souls and bodies of all those who, with faith, shall > draw and partake of it, let us pray to the Lord. :That he will graciously > enable us to perfect sanctification by participation in these waters, > through the invisible manifestation of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the > Lord. Then, following a lengthy set of didactic prayers that expound on the nature of the feast and summarize salvation history, praising God's creation of and mastery over the elements, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over the water with his hand and prays specifically for the blessing to be invoked upon it. At the climax of the service, he immerses the hand cross into the water three times in imitation of Christ's baptism to the singing of the festal troparion: > :When Thou wast baptized in the Jordan, O Lord, ::The worship of the Trinity > was made manifest. :For the voice of the Father bore witness to Thee, ::And > called Thee His beloved Son. :And the Spirit, in the form of a dove, > ::Confirmed the truthfulness of His word. :O Christ God, Who hast revealed > Thyself, ::And hast enlightened the world, glory be to Thee!

All come forward to be sprinkled over the head with the Theophany Water as they kiss the hand cross, and to drink some of it. The priest will then set out to bless the homes of all of the faithful with Theophany Water. In large parishes, this process will take some time. However, the priest must bless all of the houses of the faithful before the beginning of Great Lent. In monasteries the Hegumen (Superior) will bless the cells of all of the monks. Orthodox Christianity teaches that the Great Blessing of Waters actually changes the nature of the water, and that water so blessed is no longer corruptible, but remains fresh for many years. The Great Blessing of Waters is normally only blessed at this one time of the year; however, at the Consecration of a church, a Great Blessing of Waters will often precede the service.

The Lesser Blessing is called \\"lesser\\" not because it is shorter (in fact, it isn't), but because it does not have the same solemnity as the Great Blessing, and does not necessarily change the nature of the water. While much is the same, the rite begins with Psalm 142 (LXX) and the hymns to the Theophany of the Great Blessing are replaced in the Lesser Blessing with hymns to the Theotokos. The scriptural readings are different (, ), and the special petitions at the Great Litany are different: :That these waters may be sanctified by the power, and effectual operation, and descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord. :That there may descend upon these waters the cleansing operation of the super-substantial Trinity, let us pray to the Lord. :That this water may be unto the healing of souls and bodies, and unto the banishing of every hostile power, let us pray to the Lord. :That the Lord our God will send down the blessing of Jordan, and sanctify these waters, let us pray to the Lord. :For all those who entreat of God's aid and protection, let us pray to the Lord. :That he will illumine us with the light of understanding, with the consubstantial Trinity, let us pray to the Lord. :That the Lord our God will show us forth sons and heirs of his kingdom, through partaking of and sprinkling with these waters, let us pray to the Lord.

Metropolitan Korniliy, the head of Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church consecrating a well. Then the priest says a prayer very similar to the one used at Theophany, but when he immerses the hand cross into the water three times, instead of singing the troparion of Theophany, he sings the troparion of the Cross: > Save, O Lord, Thy people and bless Thine inheritance, granting unto the > faithful victory over enemies. And by the power of Thy Cross, do Thou > preserve Thy commonwealth. The Lesser Blessing of Waters may be performed according to need. It is specifically called for on August 1 (the feast of the Procession of the Cross); on Bright Friday (Friday in Easter Week) which is the feast of the Theotokos of the \\"Life-giving Spring\\"; and on the Feast of Mid-Pentecost, when all of the fields are blessed. There is also a tradition of blessing Holy Water on the first day of each month. Though there is no special blessing said over it, the water used for the Washing of Feet on Maundy Thursday could be considered a form of holy water, in that the Bishop or Hegumen will bless the faithful with it at the end of the ceremony. Among the Coptics, this water is blessed with the cross before the Washing of Feet. The Coptics also sprinkle the faithful with holy water on Palm Sunday, and at the end of every Divine Liturgy.

It was written by co-executive producer Ron Weiner and directed by co- executive producer John Riggi. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 12, 2009. Guest stars in the episode include Josh Fadem, Cheyenne Jackson, Padma Lakshmi, and Shawn Levy. In the episode, the new cast member for the fictional sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), Jack \\"Danny\\" Baker (Jackson) arrives on set and learns the intricacies of the show. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) offers Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) a chance to create a television pilot based on her \\"Dealbreakers\\" sketch but Liz decides to search for other offers. In addition, after offering some advice Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decide to solve other problems of the cast and crew. Finally, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) grows annoyed as the cast members begin to ask less of him. \\"The Problem Solvers\\" received generally positive reception from television critics, although some expressed disappointment in the tone. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 5.8 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot This episode opens with Liz Lemon, Jack Donaghy, and the rest of the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff welcoming Jack Baker, the new cast member, to the show. After realizing that Baker has the same first name as him, Jack quickly decides to rename him Danny. In the previous episode, Danny was hired by Jack from his work as a street performer who dressed up like a robot and had very limited recent experience with \\"real acting\\". Meanwhile, Jack offers Liz the chance to star in a new television pilot based on her \\"Dealbreakers\\" sketch. She is initially excited, but Tracy Jordan and Jenna Maroney convince her to test the market and search for other offers before agreeing to work with Jack. Liz signs with a talent agent (Josh Fadem) to explore other options, but later learns he is a low-level agent. Jack cannot stand Liz's dismissal of him, and as a result, he announces through the media that NBC is moving forward with the pilot's production and calls in Padma Lakshmi as a potential new host in place of Liz. Liz threatens to sue Jack and NBC for the rights to \\"Dealbreakers\\", but Jack informs her that NBC owns the rights to it. Liz takes a meeting with Sports Shouting producer, Scottie Shofar (Shawn Levy), and Jack meets with Padma. During their respective meetings, however, the two realize that they should work with one another. They shake hands at the end of the episode, agreeing to create the pilot together. After giving advice to Liz, Tracy and Jenna spend the episode calling themselves \\"The Problem Solvers\\" giving the TGS crew advice on their lives. From the moment he arrives, Danny treats NBC page Kenneth Parcell politely and does not ask him to run any errands for him, a break from how Tracy and Jenna treat him. Danny explains to the two that lower-level people such as pages often rise up to positions where they would be the boss of actors such as themselves, and as a result, he is polite to avoid building bad relationships with potential future bosses. Danny even speculates that Kenneth could be running the network someday. Jenna initially dismisses the idea out- of-hand, but Tracy becomes concerned, and tells Kenneth that he doesn't want him to perform any more menial tasks for him; Jenna soon joins him. Meanwhile, Kenneth lets slip that he may have been alive forever. Kenneth becomes upset that he is losing his responsibilities and confronts Danny, driving him to yell at Kenneth. Danny, who is Canadian, has had a hard time pronouncing the word \\"about\\", but after yelling at Kenneth, and saying \\"about\\" without his Canadian accent, thanks Kenneth for helping him. Production Cheyenne Jackson made his 30 Rock debut as Danny Baker in \\"The Problem Solvers\\". \\"The Problem Solvers\\" was written by Ron Weiner and directed by John Riggi, both co-executive producers on 30 Rock. This episode was Weiner's fifth writing credit, having penned \\"Secrets and Lies\\", \\"Se√±or Macho Solo\\", \\"Goodbye, My Friend\\", and \\"Mamma Mia\\", and was Riggi's second directed episode, having helmed \\"Goodbye My Friend\\" in the show's third season. \\"The Problem Solvers\\" originally aired in the United States on November 12, 2009, on NBC as the fifth episode of the show's fourth season and the 63rd overall episode of the series. \\"The Problem Solvers\\" was filmed on October 23, Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken October 28, Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken and October 29, 2009.

In this episode, the robot street performer is introduced to the TGS crew as Danny Baker, and was played by actor Cheyenne Jackson, who made his 30 Rock debut with this episode. Series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers. In \\"Audition Day\\", Jackson did not play the robot, instead actor Daniel Genalo played the character. The actor Josh Fadem played an inexperienced agent that Liz signs with in the episode. In a November 2009 interview with Tulsa World, Fadem admitted to \\"[flubbing] a couple lines\\" during filming, but that no one on the set \\"made me feel bad.\\" Director Shawn Levy guest starred in the episode as Scottie Shofar, a producer for the show Sports Shouting, and who Liz has a meeting with in regards to her \\"Dealbreakers\\" talk show. Levy directed Fey in the 2010 comedy film Date Night. Padma Lakshmi, the host of the reality show Top Chef, played herself in this 30 Rock episode in which she is a potential new host for the \\"Dealbreakers\\" talk show. Cultural references Padma Lakshmi, host of Top Chef, made a cameo as a potential replacement for Liz Lemon on a \\"Dealbreakers\\" pilot During Danny's rallying speech in a football movie flashback, he makes several references to Canadian culture such as Boxing Day and the different rules used between Canadian and American football (e.g. 3 downs instead of 4, 12 men per side instead of 11, though incorrectly uses meters while Canadian football uses yards). The episode twice refers to a fictional show Sports Shouting which features four panelists yelling at each other about sports. Some reviewers noted the similarity to the real show Around the Horn, an ESPN program which also features four panelists discussing sports in a competitive setting. J. A. Adande, a frequent panelist on Around the Horn, said through his Twitter page \\"Sports Shouting now tops 'Werewolf Bar Mitzvah' as my favorite 30 Rock gag.\\" When Jack tells Liz that Padma Lakshmi is coming in for the pilot she says \\"Then who's going to host Top Chef? You're ruining my life!\\" referring to a cooking reality television show Lakshmi hosts which Liz had previously shown a taste for in the season two episode \\"Cougars\\". Tracy reveals that early in his career he signed a very badly structured contract which requires he publicize \\"Wade Boggs Carpet World\\" five times whenever he appears on camera, a reference to the baseball player Wade Boggs. Later, Jenna reveals that Scottie Shofar was her assistant in Trivial Pursuit: The Movie. The latter is a board game in which progress is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. As Danny grew angry he described Kenneth as having a \\"weird Don Knotts face\\" and a \\"Hitler Youth haircut.\\" This was the fourth time the show referenced Liz's \\"Dealbreakers\\" story arc. This first began in the third season episode \\"Mamma Mia\\", in which Liz had written a comedy sketch titled \\"Dealbreakers\\", and in the sketch, Jenna doled out comedic catchphrases as relationship advice to other women such as \\"If he wears an Atlanta Falcons jersey to your sister's wedding? That's a Dealbreaker, ladies!\\" Liz tried gaining attention for writing the sketch, but Jenna took all the credit for it, thus making Liz jealous. Liz dispensed more \\"Dealbreaker\\"-style romantic advice in a talk show appearance in the episode \\"Kidney Now!\\" and at the end of the episode Liz told Jack that she had signed a book deal based on the sketch. In the episode \\"Into the Crevasse\\", Liz's book is published, but receives backlash from men close to her, as they believe her advice damaged their relationships. In this 30 Rock episode, Jack offers Liz a chance to create a television pilot based on her \\"Dealbreakers\\" sketch and although Liz decides to search for other offers she ultimately decides to work on the pilot with Jack. Reception Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly enjoyed Jack McBrayer's (pictured) performance. In its original American broadcast, \\"The Problem Solvers\\" was watched by 5.8 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 2.9 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, that is 2.9 percent of all people in that group, and 7 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Audition Day\\", which was watched by 5.9 million American viewers. \\"The Problem Solvers\\" received generally positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN reviewed the episode, giving it a 7.4 out of 10 rating and opining the episode had \\"a few audible chuckles and several silent smiles\\", and that the tone of it \\"was just off.\\" He cited that the Liz and Jack characters on opposing sides \\"was not as much fun as seeing them working together\\", and that Jenna and Tracy's antics throughout the series have been \\"funny most of the time\\", though \\"very little clicked in this episode.\\" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star- Ledger said that the Tracy and Jenna team \\"often seems too far out of the realm of reality ... to enjoy them.\\" Sepinwall was positive about Cheyenne Jackson's debut, noting he \\"fit in well his first time out.\\" Sean Gandert of Paste magazine called the episode the \\"best so far in the season\\" but admitted he was \\"disappointed in it\\" for not coming \\"close to greatness and we all know [30 Rock's] done it before and can do it again.\\" Gandert, who has not been a fan of Liz's \\"Dealbreakers\\" storyline, commented her plot here was \\"somewhat annoying, generally not that interesting\\", and concluded \\"it's hard to really care\\" that Liz get her talk show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad noted that he liked how Jack and Liz interacted throughout the episode, and enjoyed their meeting at the Rockefeller Center at the end. The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin was complimentary towards \\"The Problem Solvers\\", reporting it was better than the past four episodes, and writing it had \\"alternating currents of competition and collaboration, hostility and affection and love and hate\\" that, according to Rabin, define Jack and Liz's relationship. Rabin gave the episode a B grade rating. Entertainment Weekly contributor Margaret Lyons deemed this 30 Rock episode as the best work from Jack McBrayer's Kenneth. \\"If there's been a better episode for Kenneth in 30 Rock history, I'd love to know: From the backwards-talking to the bizarre fury, this was Jack McBrayer's finest (half) hour.\\" Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that this was a \\"fine\\" episode \\"with Jenna and Tracy in classic dopey-duo form and a couple of great fantasy bits ... But the Jack, Liz, and Jenna triangle felt like the funniest-ever Three's Company episode squeezed into a couple of minutes.\\" Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, said that she was looking forward to Lakshmi's cameo, but after the airing, \\"her scene fell a little flat.\\" In regards to the episode, itself, Blake said it was \\"a solid if not mind-blowing episode, even with the presence of [Lakshmi].\\" References External links 30 Rock (season 4) episodes 2009 American television episodes ","title":"The Problem Solvers"},{"id":"25071879","text":"Roll with It was a British music-themed quiz show that aired on The Family Channel in 1995.

He served as Bishop of Fort Wayne from 1900 until his death in 1924. Biography Herman Alerding was born in Westphalia and, during his infancy, came with his parents to the United States, where they settled in Newport, Kentucky. He received his early education at the parochial school of Corpus Christi Church. His local bishop, George Aloysius Carrell, did not accept him as a seminarian for the Diocese of Covington because he was unable to provide for his seminary expenses, and Alerding was instead accepted by Bishop Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais of the Diocese of Vincennes. He attended St. Charles Borromeo Seminary near Vincennes from 1858 until 1859, when the seminary was closed. He then studied at St. Thomas Seminary in Bardstown, Kentucky, for a year before returning to Indiana in 1860 and entering St. Meinrad Seminary in Spencer County. At the seminary he mentored student Paul Dresser and taught him to play a variety of musical instruments. Dresser later became among the most popular composers in the United States and authored the state song of Indiana. After receiving the tonsure and minor orders in September 1865, Alerding was ordained to the subdiaconate on June 18, 1867, and to the diaconate on the following June 21. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Saint Palais on September 22, 1869. He then served as a curate at St. Joseph Church in Terre Haute, while also attending to several missions throughout Parke and Sullivan Counties. From 1871 to 1874, he was pastor of St. Elizabeth Church in Cambridge City. While at Cambridge City, Alerding calmed a turbulent congregation which had been under interdict for several months, liquidated the parish debt, and purchased a site for a new church. He was transferred to St. Joseph Church in Indianapolis in 1874, there overseeing the construction of a church, rectory, and parochial school. He briefly served as procurator of the adjoining St. Joseph Seminary until it was closed the following year. In 1883, he published A History of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Vincennes. He was stricken by typhoid fever and took a trip to Europe in 1884. On August 30, 1900, Alerding was appointed the fourth Bishop of Fort Wayne by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 30 from Archbishop William Henry Elder, with Bishops Denis O'Donaghue and Henry K. Moeller serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He presided over a diocesan synod in November 1903. His pew-rent policy was expressly opposed by Archbishop Diomede Falconio, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States. During World War I, he established the Fort Wayne Diocesan War Council. In a pastoral letter issued in December 1918, Alerding declared, \\"We deserved the infliction of this terrible war and its awful consequences.\\" Under Alerding's administration, the number of diocesan priests nearly doubled from 109 in 1900 to 210 in 1925. In 1900, the diocese had 102 churches with resident pastors, 39 mission churches, and 73 parochial schools; in 1924, there were 148 churches with resident pastors, 31 mission churches, and 106 parochial schools. Alerding died at age 79. He had been in critical condition since he was injured in an automobile accident on Thanksgiving Day.

The courthouse, the first permanent one in the county, was built in 1935, replacing a temporary courthouse built in 1931. Loving County was organized in 1931 following an oil boom in the area; it reached a peak population of 600 shortly thereafter in 1933, though its population has since fallen to 82. Architect Evan J. Wood designed the building in the Moderne style; he was paid $2684.60 for his efforts. The two-story courthouse is the tallest building in Loving County and the only symbol of county government in the county. As Loving County is the second-least populous county in the United States, few court proceedings have taken place at the courthouse. Only 726 civil cases were filed at the courthouse between 1931 and 2004, most of them involving car accidents or business disputes among the county's oil and gas producers. The county convicted its first felon in 1936, when it sentenced oilman Norman C. Hill to four years in prison for stealing $4,000 worth of piping. Two jury trials in 2003 were the first in the county since its district court was established in 1955; the county's entire adult population was called for the 60-person jury panel, and establishing a jury was nearly impossible due to a Texas law prohibiting relatives from serving on the same jury, as only two potential jurors were unrelated to another potential juror. Nonetheless, the courthouse plays an important role in Loving County, as nearly a third of its population is employed by the county government. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 2006. As of summer 2011, a new courthouse annex was nearing completion across Collins Street to the northwest. It is expected to house the offices of the sheriff and the county clerk. The new single-story building of Southwestern style architecture will roughly equal the main courthouse in area of floor space.

It is a brick Classical Revival building with Romanesque Revival elements, such as the entrance arch, and is currently home to the non-profit Armory Foundation, National Track and Field Hall of Fame, New Balance Track and Field Center, and other organizations including the Police Athletic League of New York City. When built in the early 20th century it was one of the first armories in New York City in the Neoclassical style, instead of the Gothic Revival mode favored during the 19th century. It was home to the 22nd Regiment of the Army Corps of Engineers, was used to give licensing exams for those who wished to become architects, engineers, nurses and so on, and was later used as a homeless shelter. In 1995 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today the building is home to \\"The Fastest Track in the World\\" as more records have been set on The Armory's track than any other facility in the world. The Armory is host to 100+ track meets annually and is one of only four World Athletics Certified Indoor Facilities in the United States. https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=b0dab191-8a14-45bb-85cb-3105a172628f.pdf&urlslug;=CERTIFICATES%20-%20Certified%20Athletics%20Facilities Building Three stories high, the Armory is constructed of brick on a raised foundation with limestone and terra cotta trim. The administration building is on a fully exposed basement; the drill shed only partially. Iron bars protect the windows on the basement and first floor. The roofline is marked by a corbeled cornice and parapet with terra cotta trim. The west (front) facade features a three-part projecting entrance pavilion flanked by four-bay sides. At the corners are square bastions with crenelated parapets in terra cotta. The entrance pavilion has octagonal bastions flanking smooth rusticated limestone voussoirs around a large sally port. Both side elevations have nine asymmetrical bays, with round-arched windows in the second and third stories and double-hung casement windows at street level. Some on both sets have been filled in. Behind a wooden portcullis at the rear of the sally port is the entrance, three wooden doors inside a segmentally arched stone architrave capped with a console-style keystone. It is inscribed with the words 22ND REGIMENT CORPS OF ENGINEERS NGNY. Above it is a multi-pane transom. The interior retains much of its original finish. Rooms have terrazzo floors, glazed brick walls trimmed in terracotta. The cross-vaulted ceilings are sheathed in tiles laid in chevron patterns and have glazed terra cotta architraves at their entrances. There are bronze sconces throughout the building. A double-width staircase in fireproof steel and concrete has a curving rail. Its hallway is encircled with a wide frieze on which there are two remaining Works Progress Administration (WPA) murals. At the north and south ends of the administration building are two large company meeting rooms. The south one features a paneled dado, beamed ceilings, hardwood floors and an intricately carved mantel flanked by two Doric columns. The north meeting room features paneled mahogany wainscoting, built-in trophy cases and a glazed brick fireplace with wooden overmantel. The drill shed is a large barrel vaulted space with balcony on all sides allowing seating for 2,300. It has massive arched trusses and is lit and ventilated via a clerestory. History The west facade of the building (2014) The 22nd Regiment traces its origins to the Union Grays, who stayed behind in Manhattan when the city's other units left for the Civil War. They helped suppress the New York City draft riots in 1863 and later saw some action on the front lines. They were one of the first units to have their own armory devoted solely to military purposes. It was located originally on West 14th Street near Sixth Avenue. In 1890, the regiment moved to another armory on Broadway at Columbus Street on the Upper West Side. It was designed by one of the unit's members, Capt. John Leo. In 1907 the city's Armory Board held a competition for another new armory for the 22nd, to be located in the growing Washington Heights section of the city. The firm of Richard Walker and Charles Morris, whose works also included the South Ferry Building and several branch libraries in Brooklyn, won. The building was completed four years later, in 1911, at a cost of $1.16 million ($ in contemporary dollars). The Armory building is visible behind left field and across 168th Street in later photos of Hilltop Park, the original home of the New York Yankees. Sometime after World War II the 22nd was merged into the 42nd Division as the 102nd Engineering Battalion. It was moved around and downsized within the city's National Guard units several times until it was disbanded sometime in the late 20th century. Only two of the units survive; both are now attached to the 369th Regiment and based at its armory in Harlem. The armory remained under the jurisdiction of the New York State Division of Military & Naval Affairs. It was used as a homeless shelter late in the 20th century, housing more than 1,000 people. A plan was developed to modify and expand it for that purpose that would have compromised its historical integrity, but these plans gave way in the mid-1980s, when the Armory became New York's premiere indoor track and field facility. At , it was almost double the size of Madison Square Garden. In 1992, a campaign began to refurbish and modernize The Armory into a state-of-the-art facility. Norbert W. Sander Jr., who spearheaded the campaign, was the only New Yorker to have won the New York City Marathon, and a longtime member of the board of New York Road Runners. He raised $25 million and convinced elected officials, governmental agencies and corporate sponsors to allow him to take over the Armory. As part of the renovation, a banked track was installed.Belson, Ken (March 17, 2017) \\"Norbert W. Sander Jr., Champion of New York Running, Dies at 74\\" The New York Times In 2002, the armory was chosen as the permanent home of the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and it is now the largest site of indoor college and high school invitationals in the world. Since 2012, it has been the location for the New York Road Runners Millrose Games.  Track & Field Center  The spacious third floor is home to the New Balance Track and Field Center, a 200-meter, six-lane banked mondo track, two large runways and sand pits, a pole vault pit, and a throws cage. The Center is widely regarded as one of the premier indoor track and field facilities in the United States and is one of only four World Athletics certified facilities in the United States.https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=b0dab191-8a14-45bb-85cb-3105a172628f.pdf&urlslug;=CERTIFICATES%20-%20Certified%20Athletics%20Facilities The Center plays host to a number of meets at the high school, college, and professional/open/masters level each year, including the NYRR Millrose Games, New Balance Nationals Indoor, The Dr. Sander Invitational/Columbia Challenge and several of the largest high school meets in the country. The Armory is also home to the Colgate Women's Games Championship, which is the largest track & field series for women in the nation. The Public School Athletic League (PSAL), the largest high school athletic league in the country, also makes their home at The Armory. A number of college programs - such as Columbia University, New York University, Saint John's University, St. Francis College, City College of New York and Iona College - utilize it as their home indoor track. First held in 1908, the NYRR Millrose Games is the centerpiece of The Armory‚Äôs track and field calendar, and is arguably the most prestigious indoor meet in the world. The event formerly took place at Madison Square Garden before moving to The Armory in 2012. Millrose features elite competition at every level, with youth, high school, collegiate, professional, and masters races. Millrose traditionally concludes with the NYRR Wanamaker Mile, which has featured many icons of the sport, including Eamonn Coghlan and Bernard Lagat. At the 2020 event, Donavan Brazier, Aje√© Wilson, and Elinor Purrier each set new American records.  The Armory Foundation  The Armory Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving youth by promoting fitness and education through a broad range of athletic, educational, and community programs and strives to \\"Keep Kids on Track.\\" https://www.armory.nyc/about Part of the foundation is The Armory College Prep (ACP) that helps in ‚ÄúKeeping Kids on Track.‚Äù Only 72 percent of New York City high school students go on to attend college after graduation, a number that is significantly lower in the underserved, largely black and Latino communities that ACP draws from. For the fourth year in a row, 100 percent of the program's graduating seniors have been accepted to a four-year college. Students from the classes of 2018 and 2019 have gone on to attend Cornell, Amherst, Haverford, Williams, Washington & Lee, and many other competitive institutions. Unlike other programs that only accept students with top grades or test scores, ACP is unscreened. All students who sign up are accepted into the program, and the full-time staff works around the clock to fill in the educational gaps. Students are given an assessment at the start of the program that helps identify strengths and weaknesses. The tutors take this data and create lesson plans for each student to help them achieve their potential. ACP works to close the opportunity gap for the students by providing one-on-one tutoring in a variety of subjects, focusing on Math and English. It provides test prep for the SAT and other standardized tests, along with personalized college counseling that helps each student create a list of target schools and develop a personal narrative that is compelling to admissions officers. Through theater and literature programs, ACP also encourages students to find their own voice in the creative arts. Several years ago, ACP added a middle school program, which helps prepare younger students for the rigors of high school, along with providing curriculum depth in areas such as computer science and math. https://www.armory.nyc/armory-college-prep See also * List of armories and arsenals in New York City and surrounding counties * National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 110th Street.

PSG mainly played their home league games at the Stade de Paris in Saint-Ouen-sur- Seine, but occasionally at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes as well, registering an average attendance of 10,030 spectators per match. Guy Crescent presided the club until December 1971, when Henri Patrelle replaced him. The team was coached by Pierre Phelipon, this time exclusively as manager. Jean Djorkaeff was the team captain. PSG ended their inaugural season in the top flight with a safe 16th place, meaning they would continue in Division 1 next year, but the club was in a delicate financial situation. The Paris City Council offered 850,000 francs to pay the club's debt and save its place in the elite, but in return demanded PSG to adopt the more Parisian name \\"Paris Football Club.\\" Henri Patrelle refused the name change and the club split on June 1, 1972. Backed by the council, Guy Crescent and Pierre-√âtienne Guyot re-formed Paris FC. Consequently, Paris FC remained in Division 1, while Patrelle's Paris Saint-Germain kept their name but were administratively relegated to Division 3, thus losing professional status. Logically, most of the club's stars, including team captain Jean Djorkaeff, preferred to play elite football with Paris FC. Since only top-tier pro clubs could have a reserve team, PSG took the spot of their development side in the third tier and rebuilt their squad with many of those upcoming youth academy players.

When administered to humans intravenously, it is capable of inhibiting the plasma cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme. The dibucaine number is used to differentiate individuals who have substitution mutations (point mutations) of the enzyme's gene, resulting in decreased enzyme function. Metabolism Plasma cholinesterase is also known as butyrylcholinesterase, in part because once an individual is given butyrylcholine intravenously, the enzyme converts it to the products butyric acid and choline. This tetrameric enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of a number of substances, including amino ester local anesthetics and succinylcholine, which it hydrolyses in two stages to succinyl monocholine and choline, then to succinic acid and a second molecule of choline. Dibucaine inhibits normal butyrylcholinesterase activity, reducing the ability to convert butyrylcholine to its byproducts. The extent of the catalysis can be determined by measuring the percentage of butyrylcholine that remains unchanged in the blood of individuals administered a standard dose after dibucaine inhibition challenge in what has been established as the dibucaine number test. Kalow and Genest first described this means of determining butyrylcholinestersase activity in 1957. Typical measurement of dibucaine number in the United States yields values of 80 and above for wild type homozygotes (normal), 40‚Äì60 for heterozygotes (atypical), and 20 or less for atypical homozygotes. Dibucaine number The Dibucaine number is used to differentiate individuals who have substitution mutations of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme resulting in decreased enzyme function. At least one substitution mutation has been characterized that is capable of altering the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis. Reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity may occur as a result of inherited or acquired causes. Inherited reductions in butyrylcholinesterase activity occur because of mutations at a single autosomal location on the long arm of chromosome 3. Physiologic reductions may occur with extremes of age and during pregnancy. Other acquired causes of decreased activity include kidney and liver disease, malignancy (cancer), malnutrition, and burns. In the inherited type, an individual receives a gene from each parent, one of which may be the wild type butyrylcholinesterase, or the mutant. Thus, there may be individuals who are homozygous for the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (normal) or the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (incidence 1/3200), and there is the group of heterozygotes with one of each (incidence 1/480). Point mutation Miller's Anesthesia notes that a point mutation in the gene for human serum cholinesterase has been identified that changes Asp-70 to Gly in the atypical form of serum cholinesterase. The mutation in nucleotide 209, which changes codon 70 from GAT to GGT, was found by sequencing a genomic clone and sequencing selected regions of DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. McGuire et al. compared the entire coding sequences for usual and atypical cholinesterases, and found no other consistent base differences. They described a polymorphic site near the C terminus of the coded region, but neither allele at this locus segregated consistently with the atypical trait. They conclude that the Asp-70 to Gly mutation (acidic to neutral amino acid substitution) accounts for reduced affinity of atypical cholinesterase for choline esters and that Asp-70 must be an important component of the anionic site. Heterogeneity in atypical alleles may exist, but the Asp-70 point mutation may represent an appreciable portion of the atypical gene pool. More recently, Gaffney and Campbell have described a PCR-based method to identify the Kalow allele for butyrylcholinesterase. A quantitative variant of the usual gene and was shown to result from a single base pair change in the DNA as described above. A new method based on the polymerase chain reaction to distinguish Kalow alleles of the cholinesterase gene was developed. Using the amplification refractory mutagenesis system, two different reactions distinguished the presence of a guanine (normal E1u allele) from that of an adenine (Kalow E1k allele) at nucleotide 1615 within the coding sequences of the gene. The frequency of the Kalow allele in their sample of 51 individuals was determined to be 20%. The mean total cholinesterase activity in heterozygotes was 90% of that in persons who typed as E1uE1u homozygotes. Two E1kE1k homozygotes were identified and their cholinesterase activities were the two lowest measured. Distinction The distinctive quality of dibucaine is that its enzyme inhibition of the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (Typical) is substantially greater than that of the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (Atypical). Thus, the atypical enzyme is said to be resistant to dibucaine inhibition. This can be used to distinguish individuals in the aforementioned genetic classes. Lockridge and La Du measured atypical and usual human serum cholinesterases with the fluorescent probe, N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. Four active sites per tetramer were found in each enzyme. The turnover numbers of usual and atypical cholinesterases were the same: 15,000 mumol of benzoylcholine hydrolyzed/min/mumol of active site; 48,000 min-1 for o-nitrophenylbutyrate; and 0.0025 min-1 for N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. They had identical rate constants for carbamylation, (5.0 min-1) and for decarbamylation (0.15 h-1). The major difference between the two genetically determined forms of the enzyme was substrate affinity, KD being 0.16 mM for usual and 5.4 mM for atypical cholinesterase, for the fluorescent probe substrate. Km for the uncharged ester, o-nitrophenylbutyrate, was 0.14 mM for both enzymes, whereas Km for benzoylcholine was 0.005 mM for usual and 0.024 mM for atypical cholinesterase. We interpret these data to mean that the two enzymes differ only in the structure of their anionic site. Neuromuscular blocking When given succinylcholine, a commonly used neuromuscular-blocking drug administered for general anesthesia during surgery, the heterozygous and mutant homozygous individual will experience a prolonged duration of action of neuromuscular blockade. This results in unexpected and unwanted postoperative respiratory muscle paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation in such patients. The duration of such paralysis may last from hours to days. To identify susceptible individuals, the dibucaine number can be determined so as to alert the care team to the risks of use of butyrylcholinesterase substrates. Pestel et al. measured 24,830 Dibucaine numbers over a period of 4 years in a European trial. Numbers below 30 (atypical homozygous) were found in 0.07% (n=18) giving an incidence of 1:1,400. Dibucaine numbers from 30 to 70 (atypical heterozygous) were found in 1.23% ( n=306). On the basis of identification of the Dibucaine numbers we could avoid the administration of succinylcholine resulting in a cost reduction of 12,280 Euro offset against the total laboratory costs amounting to 10,470 Euro. Cost effect This incidence is higher than documented in the literature. Pestel et al. conclude that routine measurement of dibucaine number is a cost-effective method of identifying patients at increased risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade due to atypical cholinesterase. It is currently not standard practice to obtain such testing prior to surgery. Today, dibucaine number is typically determined after an episode of prolonged paralysis following administration of succinylcholine in order to explain the cause of the incident. Succinylcholine duration is usually on the order of 7‚Äì15 minutes and the extent of blockade is monitored with a neuromuscular stimulator. If activity at the motor endplate is not reestablished, as determined by nerve stimulator testing, an anesthesiologist will grow concerned that the patient may have a mutant form of the plasma cholinesterase enzyme, and will withhold subsequent dosing of neuromuscular blocking agents until return of function.

Kagame was also active in the political field, and was seen by some European scholars as the intellectual leader of Tutsi culture and rights under the colonial system starting in the 1940s.Dictionary of African Christian Biography \\"Kagame, Alexis \\" by Elijah Olu Akinwumi. Accessed 25 March 2010. Life Kagame was born in Nyanza, Rwanda, to a long line of court historians. His family had high status in the kingdom of Rwanda, being of the ruling Tutsi class, and also belonging to a group called Abiru, the traditional ministers in the court of the Mwami. At the time of his birth, Rwanda was a German colony, but the Mwami still had considerable power as the colonial authorities ruled indirectly through him. When the area passed to Belgium, some in his family converted to Catholicism. After attending a missionary school, he studied at Nyakibanda Regional Seminary and was ordained a priest in 1941. During this time, he was also the editor of an important Catholic newspaper, Kinyamateka, in the 1940s and 1950s (The National University of Rwanda has a nearly complete run of Kinyamateka). In 1950, he became the first African to gain membership in the Institut Royal Colonial Belge. A turning point came in 1952, when he wrote Le Code des Institutions Politiques de Rwanda (in support of his friend King Mutara III Rudahigwa), which was a defense of the Rwandan system of rule by clientage. The colonial regime, which was trying to break up Rwandans' linkages through clientage, found this threatening to their efforts to control the kingdom and pressured his bishop into reposting him to Rome. While there, he studied at the Gregorian University and took his doctoral degree in philosophy. He also became a member of \\"Les Pr√™tres Noirs\\", a group of African Theology students who wanted to employ Christianity as a basis for African nationalist aspirations.\\"Dictionary of African Christian Biography\\" After returning to Rwanda in 1958 he became a teacher at the Catholic seminary and a prominent member of the independence movement which, despite his identification with the Tutsi monarchy, may have saved him during the Belgian-led Hutu uprising in 1959. He later became one of the first professors at the new National University of Rwanda (1963) and visiting professor at the University of Lubumbashi. Kagame collected a large number of very important oral documents from high Rwandan functionaries of the pre-colonial Rwandan administration, but he published only summaries and interpretations of them, not the full accounts, because he'd promised his informants to wait to do that until they died. The European Catholic clergy and the Belgian colonial administration heartily disliked his research, writing, and politics because they seemed at odds with their post-war project to end the Rwandan royal system in favor of a modern republican system that they could, they hoped, influence more readily. As a result, the church and state at various times censored his publications either by stopping publication or cutting sections out of publications.Honore Vinck, Alexis Kagame and Aequatoria: Contribution to the biography of Alexis Kagame (1912-1981, Annales Aequatoria 1995, 16:467-586 Ten numbered paragraphs are missing from Alexis Kagame, Un Abr√©g√©, 2:335-336. Furthermore, his 1945 transcript of the Rwandan kings esoteric code was felt so dangerous to Belgian interests that the colonial military confiscated it, and it was only published in 1964 by Belgian scholars who at the time denied it was Kagame's, though they later admitted it was.M.

Kagame was put under house arrest at times by the colonial military administration to limit his political influence.e.g., Jean- Pierre Harroy, Rwanda: De la f√©odalit√© √† la d√©mocratie 1955-1962, Hayez, 1984:145, note 1. Following Rwandan independence, he became a strong advocate for the Africanization of Christianity, maintaining that missionary attitudes were still prevalent. Alexis Kagame is a first cousin once removed of Landoald Ndasingwa and his sister Louise Mushikiwabo who describes him as a very tall, massive jolly man with a big sense of humor, despite his critical inclinations. Mgr. Kagame died unexpectedly in 1981, while on a visit to Nairobi.L. Mushikiwabo and J. Kramer, Rwanda means the Universe: A natives memoir of blood and bloodlines. St. Martins Press, NY, 2006:146-147.  Work  = Political= According to Claudine Vidal, Kagame's overarching goal was the creation of a constitutional monarchy.Vidal, Claudine (1969) Sociologie des Pasions: C√¥te de Ivoire, Rwanda. Paris: Editions Karthala in Pottier 204 Kagame studies portrayed a pre-colonial Rwandese society in which ubuhake cattle clientship created a harmonious society that allows easy social mobility. He eventually partnered with Belgian anthropologist , who reworked Kagame's thesis into highly influential academic works. Subsequent academic research largely disproved the Kagame-Maquet depiction of an idyllic pre- colonial society by taking into account the degrading uburetwa land contract. Uburetwa was largely ignored by Maquet, whose research relied upon Kagame's manuscripts.Pottier 110-111, 204 Kagame's depiction of a stable, socially progressive nation, as well as his maps showing expansive territorial influence, were used by the Rwandan Patriotic Front in the late 1990s to justify their rule and invasion of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.Pottier 46 =Linguistic = His international linguistic reputation rests mainly on two works: * La Philosophie Bantu-Rwandaise de l'√ätre (1956): an analysis of the Kinyarwanda language and culture as it relates to their concept of \\"Being\\". and, * La Philosophie Bantu Compar√©e (1976): A broader study including all the Bantu languages. In these works, Kagame attempts to demonstrate that the structure of the Bantu languages reveals a complex ontology that is uniquely African in nature. Critics charge that he is imposing Aristotelian concepts on something that is non-logical. In other words, that language structure was not consciously designed but, rather, developed randomly over a long period and therefore is the cause, not the effect, of the way people think.African Philosophy in Search of Identity, by D. A. Masolo, Chapter 4: \\"Language and Reality\\", Indiana University Press, 1994 Nonetheless, Kinyarwanda is generally accepted to be one of the most orderly, complex, and difficult languages in the world. * Un Abr√©g√© de l‚ÄôEthno-histoire du Rwanda.

Built in 1823, it was where United States President and American Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant (1822-85) lived from 1823 until 1839, when he left for the United States Military Academy at West Point. In 1976, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nine years later, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. It is now owned by a local nonprofit organization as part of a suite of Grant-related museum properties in Georgetown. Description and history The Grant Boyhood Home is located northeast of the center of Georgetown, at the northwest corner of East Grant Avenue and North Water Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick house, with a side-gable roof and a three-bay front facade. The main entrance is in the leftmost bay, and all of the window and door openings are topped by stone lintels. A two-story brick ell extends to the rear, as do a pair of single- story wood frame ells; all of these are either 19th-century additions made by Jesse Grant, or are reconstructions. The interior of the house retains original flooring and woodwork. The house, along with a number of its additions, was built in 1823 by Jesse and Hannah Grant, the parents of Ulysses S. Grant. The family moved into this house when Ulysses was 16 months old, and it is where he grew up. Grant left for West Point in 1839, but was a frequent visitor over the next few years, and this house is the home he lived in the longest. Grant is known to have spent substantial time at his father's tannery, located just across the street. By the 1970s, the house had deteriorated in condition and was at threat of demolition. It was rescued from that fate, and the nonprofit US Grant Homestead Association was formed to restore and maintain it. The organization now owns the house, a schoolhouse attended by Grant, and the tannery building. See also *Grant Birthplace, Point Pleasant, Ohio *Ulysses S.

Ottoman Socialist Party (1910‚Äì1913) Refik Nevzat, socialist politician during the Second Constitutional Era. Avnullah K√¢zƒ±m√Æ, one of the early socialists. Before the formation of the party, socialist parties or groupings only existed among the Ottoman Empire's minorities, the Selanik predominantly Jewish Socialist Workers' Federation and Bulgarian left-wing party called People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section), as well as to some Bulgarian narrow socialists, who worked there.Mark Mazower, Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430-1950, 2004, p. 287. On the other hand, there were the Istanbul Greek Socialist Center, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. As Ezel Kural Shaw has written in her History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, the Ottoman Socialist Party \\"gained its main support from the Armenian and Bulgarian groups in the Parliament\\". The Ottoman Socialist Party was actually not a real political party in the modern sense, but rather a group of intellectuals. After the Young Turks had taken stringent measures against the opposition, the party began to support the opposition. In September 1911, an international organization of the party, led by Dr. Refik Nevzat, was founded in Paris, which should establish contacts with the international workers' movement. Although the activities of this group have remained limited, H√ºseyin Hilmi succeeded, however, in having a correspondence with Jean Jaur√®s. But the party failed to be admitted to the Second International. After the 1913 military coup of the Young Turks, the opposition began to be massively repressed, difficult times began for the Ottoman Socialist Party. H√ºseyin Hilmi was arrested the same year and remained until 1918, either in prison or in exile. This amounted practically to the end of the party. Turkish Socialist Party (1919‚Äì1922) Baha Tevfik Seal of the Socialist Party of Turkey (1919) Its chairman was the journalist H√ºseyin Hilmi, founder on 26 February 1919 of the socialist weekly ƒ∞≈ütirak.born in Izmir, deceased on November 15, 1922 in Istanbul, he was nicknamed \\"ƒ∞≈ütirak√ßƒ± Hilmi\\", \\"Socialist Hilmi\\", \\"ƒ∞≈ütirak\\" was the Ottoman Turkish language term for socialist, as in Arabic ÿ•ÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÉŸä ishtirƒÅkiyy Other leading members were Avnullah K√¢zƒ±m√Æ, Namƒ±k Hasan, Pertev, Tevfik, ƒ∞bnil Tahir, ƒ∞smail Faik, Baha Tevfik, Hamid Suphi. After the fall of the Young Turks regime, the party was reactivated in 1919 under the leadership of H√ºseyin Hilmi and Mustafa Fazƒ±l under the name Socialist Party of Turkey (, TSF). The party had contact from the beginning with the Second International, it was also represented at its congresses in Bern, Amsterdam and Geneva. There was also a Workers' International Association in Istanbul, mainly made up of minorities, Greeks, Bulgarians and Jews. Although the founding in September 1919 by Dr. ≈ûefik H√ºsn√º (Deymer) of the Turkish Workers and Peasants Socialist Party (), leaning towards the Third International, led many members to leave the TSF, it successfully led the great strikes' wave of 1920. In a short time the party, which basically organized trade union activities, won a lot of popularity among the workers. On the other hand, H√ºseyin Hilmi successfully exploited the conflicts between the British garrison headquarters in Istanbul and the French firms. Therefore, he could get the support from British authorities in Istanbul. After the conflicts between the French and English had been mitigated and the party had become a threat to international firms, the TSF lost its power. The firms founded and supported competing labor organizations such as Amele Siyanet Cemiyeti and forced the workers to become affiliated to these organizations. The compulsory membership in 1922 was one of the main reasons for the great defeat of the strike of streetcar workers. After this defeat, H√ºseyin Hilmi was arrested and the party was dissolved. Splinter party Independent Socialist Party () reported no success. The Socialist Party of Turkey was organized almost only in Istanbul. It maintained distance from the Kemalists who led a national movement against the occupation of Anatolia, and the Communists who tried to unite the workers organizations. The TSF was more a trade union than a political party.

It forms part of a wider territory called Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha which includes Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Location and description Tristan da Cunha island This archipelago, 1500 miles (2500 km) from the continents of Africa and South America, is one of the most remote inhabited places on earth. It consists of the following islands: * the main island Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands  Tristan da Cunha, the main island and largest () area:  Inaccessible Island area:  Nightingale Islands area: * Nightingale Island area: * Middle Island area: * Stoltenhoff Island area: * Gough Island (Diego Alvarez) area: important as the largest undisturbed cool-temperate island habitat in the South Atlantic Ocean. The main island is quite mountainous; the only flat area is the location of the capital, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, on the northwest coast. The highest point is a volcano called Queen Mary's Peak reaching ; it is covered by snow in winter and is listed as an ultra prominent peak. Tristan da Cunha is thought to have been formed by a long-lived centre of upwelling magma called the Tristan hotspot. The climate is marine cool-temperate with small temperature differences between summer and winter () and between day and night. Sandy Point on the east coast is reputed to be the warmest and driest place on the island, being in the lee of the prevailing winds. Flora Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha Even the smaller islands have some plant cover, with the larger ones dominated by ferns and moss. Flora on the archiplego includes many endemic species and many that have a broad circumpolar distribution in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. Thus many of the species that occur in Tristan da Cunha occur as far away as New Zealand. For example, the species Nertera depressa was first collected in Tristan da Cunha,Linnean Society of London. 1906. The journal of the Linnean Society of London, Published by Academic Press for the Linnean Society of London., v. 37 but has since been recorded in occurrence as far distant as New Zealand.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Fauna Tristan da Cunha is home to ocean-going species including subantarctic fur seal, the southern elephant seal and birds such as northern rockhopper penguins and macaroni penguins. The islands are important for their bird life both those established on the islands and breeding seabirds, of which twenty species nest on Gough Island alone. Important species include Tristan albatross, Tristan thrush, Tristan bunting, Gough bunting, Gough moorhen, Atlantic petrel, and the Inaccessible Island rail. There are no native reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fish, or land mammals. Human settlement Apart from Tristan da Cunha, which was settled as a base for whaling and sealing in the 18th century, the islands of the group are uninhabited except for a weather station on Gough Island belonging to South Africa. Fishing is still an important economic activity especially for crayfish and octopus but also the Tristan rock lobster (Jasus tristani). Gough Island has also been used as base for whaling and sealing but only ever temporarily. The islands do receive a small number of tourists. Threats and preservation Sheep and cattle have been introduced on Tristan da Cunha and their grazing, along with other human activity has caused damage to the island's ecosystems. Night fishing has caused the deaths of many seabirds as they crash into ships' lights.Ryan, P. G. 1991.

Aged 21 when the essay was published, it established his reputation. It later appeared in his first book, The Works of Max Beerbohm (1896) as The Pervasion of Rouge. Written while still an undergraduate at Merton College, Oxford, Beerbohm intended that his essay A Peep into the Past, a satire on Oscar Wilde, should be published in the first number of The Yellow Book, but it was held over to make way for another essay, A Defence of Cosmetics, which appeared in that journal in April 1894. A Peep into the Past was possibly withheld because of the impending Wilde scandal. When it was published, A Defence of Cosmetics was singled out for vilification as \\"decadent\\", and subsequent issues of The Yellow Book containing his work were condemned by the establishment. Beerbohm contended that the use of make-up by women, and some men, was becoming the norm in the 1890s, and that the mask was becoming more important than the face. His essay claimed that \\"most women are not as young as they are painted... Cosmetics are not going to be a mere prosaic remedy for age or plainness, but all ladies and girls will come to love them...the season of the unsophisticated is gone by, and the young girl's final extinction beneath the rising tides of cosmetics will leave no gap in life and will rob art of nothing... Artifice, sweetest exile, is come into her kingdom.\\"The Yellow Book April 1894 Sun-tan make-up was being used by \\"countless gentlemen who walk about town in the time of its desertion from August to October, artificially bronzed, as though they were fresh from the moors or the Solent. This, I conceive, is done for purely social reasons.\\" Alison Gernsheim, Victorian & Edwardian Fashion: A Photographic Survey pg 82The Yellow Book April 1894 The essay, an ironic defence of Decadence, created a sensation when it appeared in 1894. Delighted with the essay, William Rothenstein wrote to Beerbohm, \\"...all my friends chuckled over your dear cosmetics as they read & reread them. Oscar, solitary exception, was moved to a torrent of tears, so strong was his emotion\\". To Lord Alfred Douglas, Oscar Wilde wrote: \\"Max on Cosmetics in the Yellow Book is wonderful: enough style for a large school, and all very precious and thought-out: quite delightfully wrong and fascinating\\". Wilde, appreciating Beerbohm's wise but ironic manner, commented that \\"The gods bestowed on Max the gift of perpetual old age\\".Beerbohm on the 'Mr Oscar Wilde' website References External links *Turning the pages of A Defence of Cosmetics *A Defence of Cosmetics on Victorian Web *Mocking the Victorian Sages: Beerbohm's \\"A Defence of Cosmetics\\" 1894 essays Works by Max Beerbohm Essays by Max Beerbohm Works originally published in The Yellow Book ","title":"A Defence of Cosmetics"},{"id":"25072456","text":"Geestland is a town in the district of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

He earned both a BFA and an MFA at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, where he studied with, among others, Dan Graham. He emerged in the 1970s as a postconceptual artist who explored and tested the boundaries of traditional photography. Welling lives and works in Los Angeles.James Welling Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Life and work During his career, Welling has experimented with different photographic mediums, including Polaroids, gelatin silver prints, photograms, and digital prints. Having studied under John Baldessari at CalArts and exhibited with Sherrie Levine at Metro Pictures, Welling began his career in the so-called Pictures Generation. His self- education in photography began in 1976 with the series Los Angeles Architecture & Portraits. In 1977 his second series, Diary/Landscape, matched the handwriting of his great-grandparents' letters with winter landscapes in Connecticut. Another well-known 2009 series by Welling is a meditation over a period of three years on Philip Johnson‚Äôs Glass House, shot in situ using colored filters.Ken Johnson (January 30, 2014), Digital, Analog and Waterlogged New York Times.Sharon Mizota (October 18, 2013), Review: James Welling searches for beauty Los Angeles Times. By contrast, his images of the Maison de Verre, are digitally manipulated. The rooms are lightened and brightened so that in some cases they glow unnaturally like a magazine spread. Yet another series consists of rectangles of pure color, made in the darkroom using colored filters. For his photogram series Torsos (2005‚Äì08), Welling cut screening, of the same type used for windows, to follow bodily contours and placed them on chromogenic paper before exposing them.Whitney Biennial 2008: James Welling Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Welling has held various teaching positions at universities since 1995. He is currently Area Head of Photography at UCLA. In the fall of 2014, he will serve as Visiting Professor of Photography at Princeton University, where he previously held the position in 2012. Welling was the photographer of the cover art for Sonic Youth's 1985 album Bad Moon Rising.Geffen Records, Sonic Youth ad, Spin, April 1995: 38. He collaborated with U.S. poet Susan Howe, providing six black-and- white photograms to accompany the text of That This, published in 2010. In 2009 he designed a hand-knotted rug for BravinLee programs. For the spring collection of Italian fashion label Brioni, Welling collaborated with the brand's creative director Brendan Mullane on a triple exposed floral print that was showered over zip front collared jackets, short sleeved silk shirts and Prince of Wales check suits.JJ Martin (June 24, 2014), Brioni S/S 2015 Wallpaper.

Notable work includes his recordings with many widely known musical acts including: Temptations, Commodores, Bonnie Pointer, Chairmen of the Board, Lionel Richie, Freda Payne, Smokey Robinson and members of Funkadelic, as well as record producers Holland-Dozier-Holland and Jeffrey Bowen. Early life Multi- instrumentalist, arranger, performer and composer, Donald Charles Baldwin was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. During his school years, Baldwin learned to play the clarinet, bass clarinet, saxophone, oboe, English horn and bassoon, while studying composition. After writing his first Concerto for Strings and Horns in 1969, Donald formed a contemporary style band, Jasmine, in which he composed the music, played the piano and sang. Jasmine performed locally in and around the Detroit area, including performances held at Wayne State University as part of the nationwide Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Career Jasmine was discovered by Jeffrey Bowen, the Vice- President of Holland-Dozier-Holland's Invictus/Hot Wax records. Like H-D-H, Bowen had been with Motown Records in the mid-1960s where he was an assistant to A&R; chief Mickey Stevenson, the co-producer of the Temptations‚Äô 1967 LP In a Mellow Mood (#1 R&B;, #13 Pop)Whitburn, Joel (1999) Top R&B; Albums 1965-1998 and the co-writer of ‚ÄúYou‚Äù a 1968 hit for Marvin Gaye (#7 R&B;, #34 Pop).Whitburn, Joel (1996) Top R&B; Singles 1942-1995 Not long after the legendary H-D-H team left Motown, they were joined by Bowen at their new company. Bowen discovered Jasmine through the drummer's father, the Detroit Symphony's 1st violinist - Felix Resnick, who at the time contracted and lead many of string sessions for Motown and Invictus. Bowen was impressed enough by Baldwin's band to arrange for Jasmine to rehearse with Ruth Copeland, a British singer/songwriter who was signed to Invictus. In June 1970, Donald and Ruth co-wrote ‚ÄúThe Medal‚Äù,BMI Repertoire: Songwriter/Composer: Baldwin, Donald C CAE/IPI#86581050 the opening cut from Copeland's second Invictus LP, I Am What I Am,Liner notes to Ruth Copeland featuring Parliament's Self Portrait/I Am What I Am CD by Howard Priestly (1997) a recording that features Ruth, backed by the members of Funkadelic along with guitarist Ray Monette of Rare Earth. Within a few months, Donald Baldwin signed a contract with Invictus Records and Gold Forever Music as an Artist-Songwriter-Arranger. After several rehearsals, the original members of Funkadelic (Billy Bass Nelson, Eddie Hazel and Tiki Fulwood), along with current band member Bernie Worrell and future Funkadelic Ron Bykowski, began to gradually replace all of the members of Donald's band, Jasmine, except for Donald Baldwin. Soon after, this lineup started touring as Ruth Copeland's band. Funkadelic, were also backing up Parliament, another Invictus act at the time. In between Ruth's tour dates, Donald and the rest of the band would back up other Invictus acts, locally, such as 100 Proof Aged in Soul, The Jones Girls and Honey Cone. In late 1970, the group began backing Ruth exclusively, as they became the opening act for Sly and the Family Stone throughout 1971-1972,Rolling Stone Dec 23, 1971 - Ruth Copeland by Timothy Ferres including a couple of gigs at Madison Square Garden and a couple of others where Sly pulled his infamous no-show act. In 1972, Baldwin wrote and conducted the rhythm, string, and horn arrangements for three tracks produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland on Freda Payne for her Reaching Out LP.Album jacket credits for Freda Payne‚Äôs Reaching Out LP (1973), One of the three, \\"Mother Misery's Favorite Child\\", was included on the Invictus Club Classics Vol II compilation CD; While another, ‚ÄúTwo Wrongs Don‚Äôt Make a Right‚Äù, became a minor R&B; hit in the summer of 1973, peaking at #75.Whitburn, Joel (1996) Top R&B; Singles 1942-1995 During the 2nd half of 1972, Ruth & her band opened several shows for Three Dog Night, as well as David Bowie, on the US leg of his Ziggy Stardust Tour, including the tour's initial gig in ClevelandFusion Magazine; January 1973 - David Bowie Gimme Your Hands by Tim Jurgens and a well publicized show at Carnegie Hall in NYC.Time Magazine 7 Oct 1972 Ziggy Stardust Outshines Bolan by Linda Solomon It was around this time that Ruth Copeland split from her manager Jeffrey Bowen and began working with a new manager Jeffrey Tofler. Soon after, Ruth & Co were once again opening gigs for Sly & the Family Stone. However, this new arrangement was quickly shut down, promptly Ruth to leave Invictus. Copeland eventually signed with RCA Records, working on material for a new album with Daryl Hall, once she had been released from her H-D-H contract. As a result, the band suddenly found themselves recording and touring with the Chairman of the Board, another Holland-Dozier-Holland/Invictus act. Late in 1972, Jeffrey Bowen began producing the Skin I'm In album Liner notes to the Chairmen of the Board‚Äôs Bittersweet and Skin I‚Äôm In CD by Howard Priestly (1998) on the Chairmen of the Board in NYC, using Donald and the previously mentioned members of Funkadelic on the sessions.

By the time the group left the UK, ‚ÄúFinders Keepers‚Äù was England's #1 hit. In 1974, Donald was signed to Motown Records and Jobete/Stone Diamond Music as an Artist, Songwriter, Composer, and Arranger. While in transition between HDH and Motown, Donald and Jeffery Bowen, as ghost writers, co-wrote and arranged ‚ÄúI Feel Sanctified‚Äù for the Commodores debut album, Machine Gun.

Life and work Born in Homs in 1912, al-Shaghouri was soon orphaned and moved to Damascus with his brother. As a child, he worked as an errand boy and later as a weaver. He attended the lessons of the major scholars of Damascus: Husni al-Baghghal, Muhammad Barakat, 'Ali al-Daqar, Ismail al-Tibi, and Lutfi al-Hanafi. However, his most important teacher was Muhammad al-Hashimi, an Algerian Sufi from Tlemcen who had already been living in Syria for twenty years before becoming the representative of Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi, spiritual master of the Shadhili tariqa. Al-Shaghouri himself met al-Alawi in 1932 in Damascus, but it was al-Hashimi who served as his spiritual guide. Finding that al-Shaghouri was already suitable, al-Hashimi placed him in a spiritual retreat. On the first day, al-Shaghouri pledged himself to al-Hashimi's guidance, an unusual occurrence in Sufi instruction and discipleship. Al-Shaghouri soon became an important figure within al- Hashimi's tariqa, serving as the lead singer for his session of sacred dance (Ha·∏çra). Before his death in 1961, al-Hashimi had also given al-Shaghouri permission to transmit the general litany of the tariqa, a daily formula of meditations and prayers that typically serves to signal a disciple's commitment to his tariqa. Although he had received authorization as a full spiritual guide by Muhammad Sa'id al-Hamzawi of Syria and Ali al- Budlaymi of Algeria, he did not take any disciples until he was also authorised by his friend and companion, Muhammad Sa'id al-Kurdi from Irbid (Jordan). Despite al- Kurdi himself being renowned as one of the great spiritual guides of his time, particularly in Jordan, he only gave his authorization to al-Shaghouri to be a spiritual guide and his successor upon his death. Despite his commitment to his spiritual order, al-Shaghouri always maintained an occupation until his illnesses made him unable to work. He was a textile worker and Syria's representative in the United Arab Workers Union. He was forced to resign for refusing to comply with the nationalization of factories in Syria, and he later became a teacher in many religious institutes in Damascus. He was also a representative of workers in the Syrian Parliament. For years he also gave sermons at the al-Khayyat mosque in Damascus, until 1999 when a stroke resulted in a long coma and left him severely weakened. As a singer in al- Hashimi's choir for the hadra, al-Shaghouri memorised vast amounts of mystical poetry, which served as the basis for much his teaching and instruction. He was himself a poet, and his poetry was often sung in the hadra, and continues to be sung today. Al-Shaghouri's poetry draws on Arabic and Islamic literary tradition, and combines a genuine spiritual experience with a great mastery of poetical techniques. His poetry is, both in content and in form, akin to that of Ibn al-Farid, Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi and Ahmad al-Alawi. He published his poems in a diwan which he edited towards the end of his life, titled \\"Al- hada‚Äôiq al-nadiyya fƒ´ al-nasamat al-ruhiyya\\" (\\"The dewy gardens in the spiritual breezes\\").Damascus, DƒÅr fajr al-‚Äòur≈´ba, 2nd ed., 1998. Some poems have been published separately in many collections.  Weakness and death  Despite his later physical weakness, he never stopped receiving visitors or attending the weekly hadra at the Nur al-Din al-Shahid mosque, in the old quarter of Damascus. He died on 8 June 2004. A great crowd gathered to attend his funeral at the mosque dedicated to Shaykh Muhy al-Din Ibn Arabi. The funeral prayer was led by Habib Ali al-Jifri, from Yemen, a well-known representative of traditional scholarship and Sufism in Arab media. His death was widely mourned by scholars and laymen alike, and he was widely recognized as one of the most important revivers of the Shadhili tariqa and Sufism in general, particularly in Syria. His legacy and renown has also become widespread (particularly in the English-speaking world) through two American students whom he authorized in the Shadhili tariqa, Nuh Ha Mim Keller and Zaid Shakir.

Both the drawing style and the content are purposely made naive and amateuristic and the situations are surreal and violent. There is also a lot of insulting and toilet humour in the series. Concept Wesley is a gnome wearing a red hat and suit. He is typically cranky and short-tempered. He often has surreal adventures which are told in one-page gag-a-day stories, where he encounters various people, other gnomes and anthropomorphic characters who either confuse him and/or annoy him. As a result, he often gets angry and violent. Both the comic strip as well as the animated TV spin-off are drawn in a simple, na√Øve style. History Jonas Geirnaert Geirnaert invented Wesley the Gnome while creating his short animation film Flatlife (winner of the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival) in 2004. As this film required him to be very perfectionistic and thorough, he drew Wesley the Gnome as a side project and intentionally spent no time on good graphics, interesting plotlines or other recurring characters. In 2008 the comics were published in the magazine HUMO. Despite their popularity Geirnaert decided to terminate the series after only 27 episodes. In the autumn of 2009 Wesley the Gnome was granted new life through a series of animated shorts, broadcast once a week in the human interest TV series Man Bijt Hond. Originally all the shorts were based on the comics Geirnaert drew earlier, but as this material ran short he created several more episodes, which were once again pre- published in Humo. When the TV episodes were uploaded on YouTube as well the cartoons gained an even broader audience, especially in The Netherlands. Due to the cult appeal Geirnaert appeared in several Flemish and Dutch media. Geirnaert provides Wesley's voice in all the cartoons, typically after roughing up his vocal cords in warming-up sessions. His Jelle De Beule, who also collaborates with him in their comedy group Neveneffecten, does the other voices. The animation is made by the Volstok Telefunken studios. The background music is Hammond organ music by Klaus Wunderlich. Other numbers used include La Felicidad from the album The Golden Sound of Hammond (aka Hammond F√ºr Millionen),Klaus Wunderlich - La felicidad, muziek van Kabouter Wesley Hasta La Vista, from the album Hammond Pops 10Klaus Wunderlich - Hasta la vista, muziek van Kabouter Wesley and the single Tico Tico.Klaus Wunderlich - Tico Tico, muziek van Kabouter Wesley Besides of Klaus Wunderlich's music, also Coconut from The Electronic SystemThe Electronic System - Coconut was used. The comics and cartoons quickly became popular with audiences, albeit somewhat polarizing with others who didn't enjoy the intentional silliness and vulgarity. In 2010 a radio commercial for Humo, where Geirnaert provided the voice of Wesley caused controversy due to a joke where Wesley threatens some children with sending them to a \\"special education\\" school if they don't obey him. Pedagogues and teachers from schools for mentally challenged children felt the joke was offensive and stigmatized them.http://www.4teensonline.be/Pub/4teensonline/4teens_new- Nieuwsartikels/Life/Kabouter-Wesley-beledigt-buitengewoon- onderwijs.htmlhttp://www.taalblad.be/e-zine/kort-en-klein/kaftpapier-kabouter- wesley-veroorzaakt-fikse-ruzie/659.html Wesley was soon used in all kinds of merchandising, including on the streetcars who drive to the Belgian coast.http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid954452/kabouter-wesley-prijkt-op-nieuwe- kusttram A video game spin-off was also created, in collaboration with Geirnaert.https://www.creativeskills.be/user/bramvd/het-kabouter-wesley- computerspel/ In 2010 Geirnaert once again terminated his series because he ran out of ideas.http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/948/Kunst- Literatuur/article/detail/1152911/2010/09/03/Kabouter-Wesley-The-end.dhtml The same year a huge comic book collecting all the Kabouter Wesley cartoons was published by Borgerhoff & Lamberigts.http://www.borgerhoff- lamberigts.be/boeken/p/detail/het-kleine-kabouter-wesley- boekhttp://www.stripweb.be/S-stripverhaal-het-grote-kabouter-wesley-boek- bestellen-11977.asp It was later also released in a smaller format.http://stripgids.org/2011/09/het-grote-kabouter-wesley-boek-nu-ook-in- het-klein/ The animated shorts are not available on video, though they have been collected on video as a one-shot gift with one 2010 issue of Humo.http://www.humo.be/extras-bij-humo/28814/deze-week-bij-humo-alle- filmpjes-van-kabouter-wesley Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:98%;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\" # !! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\"Original title (top) English title (bottom) !! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\"Directed by !! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\"Written by !! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\"Original airdate !! style=\\"background-color: #DEDDE2;\\"Prod. code } References External links * Kabouter Wesley on the website of HUMO * Interview with Jonas Geirnaert on humortv.vara.nl 2008 comics debuts 2010 comics endings Comics characters introduced in 2008 Film franchises introduced in 2009 2009 Belgian television series debuts 2010 Belgian television series endings 2000s Belgian television series Belgian adult animated comedy television series Belgian comic strips Belgian comics titles Gag-a-day comics Black comedy comics Self-reflexive comics Metafictional comics Metafictional characters Surreal comedy Male characters in comics Fictional gnomes Fictional Belgian people Belgian comics characters Comics adapted into television series Comics adapted into animated series Television series based on Belgian comics Animated film series ","title":"Kabouter Wesley"},{"id":"25072687","text":"Preetinder Singh Bharara (; born October 13, 1968) is an American lawyer, author, and former federal prosecutor who served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for five years prior to leading the Southern District. According to The New York Times, Bharara was one of the \\"nation's most aggressive and outspoken prosecutors of public corruption and Wall Street crime\\" during his tenure.Benjamin Weiser & William K. Rashbaum, With Preet Bharara‚Äôs Dismissal, Storied Office Loses Its Top Fighter, The New York Times (March 10, 2017). Born in Firozpur, India, his family immigrated to New Jersey in 1970. Bharara graduated from Harvard College in 1990 and attended Columbia Law School before joining Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher as a litigation associate in 1993. Three years later he moved to Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman & Goodman, where he did white-collar defense work. Bharara first entered the public sector as chief counsel to Senator Chuck Schumer, charged with investigating the 2006 presidential dismissal of U.S. attorneys. He transferred to the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004 as an assistant U.S. Attorney, launching his career as a federal prosecutor. The Italian mafia was heavily prosecuted by his office, convicting four out of the Five Families of drug trafficking, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit murder. Bharara similarly headed various counter-terrorism cases, particularly against Al-Qaeda. His office used a variety of unconventional tactics to close cases such as wiretapping and asset seizure. He prosecuted nearly 100 Wall Street executives for insider trading and securities fraud using these methods. Bharara closed multi-million dollar settlements with the four largest banks in the country, and most notably, shut down multiple high-profile hedge funds. Known for his technocratic approach to prosecution, he routinely convicted both Democratic and Republican politicians on public corruption violations. Bharara occasionally pursued criminals extraterritorially, which after a 2013 Russian money laundering investigation, had him permanently banned from entering Russia. He also strained India‚ÄìUnited States diplomatic relations by prosecuting prominent members of the Indian and Indian-American community, most notably high-profile diplomats, chief executives, businessmen, and hedge fund managers. Upon the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bharara was dismissed after refusing to submit his resignation as part of the 2017 dismissal of U.S. attorneys. After leaving government, he launched a series of podcasts including Stay Tuned with Preet, and went into academia by joining New York University School of Law's criminal justice faculty. He authored his first book, Doing Justice: A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law, in 2019. Early life and career Bharara was born in 1968 in Firozpur, Punjab, India, to a Sikh father and Hindu mother. His parents immigrated to the United States in 1970 and Bharara became a U.S. citizen aged 12. He grew up in Eatontown in suburban Monmouth County, New JerseyLattman, Peter. \\"The Fabulous Bharara Boys\\", The New York Times, June 9, 2011. Accessed August 9, 2012. \\"He told the audience that he and his brother who grew up in Eatontown, N.J., carved similar paths. Preet, 46, graduated from Harvard College, and Vinnie, 39, from the University of Pennsylvania.\\" and attended Ranney School in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1986. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1990 and a Juris Doctor degree from Columbia Law School in 1993 where he was a member of the Columbia Law Review. In 1993, Bharara joined the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher as a litigation associate. In 1996, Bharara joined the firm of Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman & Goodman, where he did white-collar defense work.Lizz Riggs, Preet Bharara and Mindy Kaling are Harvard Law School's 2014 Class Day Speakers, Harvard Law Today (March 5, 2014). Bharara served as the chief counsel to Senator Chuck Schumer and played a leading role in the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary investigation into the firings of United States attorneys. He was an assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan for five years, from 2004 to 2009, bringing criminal cases against the bosses of the Gambino crime family, Colombo crime family and Asian gangs in New York City. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Bharara was nominated to become U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York by President Barack Obama on May 15, 2009, and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He was sworn into the position on August 13, 2009. In September 2014, when Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, Bharara was speculated as being a potential candidate as the next United States Attorney General. =International investigations= Bharara (right) waits with Attorney General Eric Holder to announce charges related to the 2011 alleged Iran assassination plot. Bharara's office sent out agents to more than 25 countries to investigate suspects of arms and narcotics trafficking and terrorists, and bring them to Manhattan to face charges. One case involved Viktor Bout, an arms trafficker, who lived in Moscow and had a deal involving selling arms to Colombian terrorists. Bharara argued that this aggressive approach is necessary in post 9/11 era. Defense lawyers criticized the stings, calling Bharara's office \\"the Southern District of the World.\\" They also argued that American citizens would not appreciate other countries' treating them in these ways. Countries have not always rushed to cooperate, according to a review of secret State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. On April 13, 2013, Bharara was on a list released by the Russian Federation of Americans banned from entering the country over their alleged human rights violations. The list was a direct response to the so-called Magnitsky list revealed by the United States the day before. =Actions against financial crime= Insider trading In 2012, Bharara was featured on a cover of Time magazine entitled \\"This Man is Busting Wall Street\\" for his office's prosecutions of insider trading and other financial fraud on Wall Street. From 2009 to 2012 (and ongoing), Bharara's office oversaw the Galleon Group insider trading investigation against Raj Rajaratnam, Rajat Gupta, Anil Kumar and more than 60 others. Rajaratnam was convicted at trial on 14 counts related to insider trading. Bharara is said to have \\"reaffirmed his office‚Äôs leading role in pursuing corporate crime with this landmark insider trading case, which relied on aggressive prosecutorial methods and unprecedented tactics.\\" In 2011 when hedge fund portfolio manager Chip Skowron pleaded guilty to insider trading, Bharara said: \\"Chip Skowron is the latest example of a portfolio manager willing to pay for proprietary, non-public information that gave him an illegal trading edge over the average investor. The integrity of our market is damaged by people who engage in insider trading....\\" Skowron was sent to prison for five years. Bharara has often spoken publicly and written an op-ed about the culture surrounding corporate crime and its effect on market confidence and business risk. After 85 straight convictions for insider- trading cases, he finally lost one on July 17, 2014, when a jury acquitted Rajaratnam's younger brother, Rengan, of such charges.\\"The Limits of the Law in Insider Trading\\". The New York Times (July 18, 2014). Retrieved March 18, 2015. On October 22, 2015, Bharara dropped seven insider-trading cases two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to a review a lower court decision that would make it harder to pursue wrongful-trading cases. The conviction of Michael S. Steinberg was dropped; Steinberg was the highest-ranking officer of SAC Capital Advisors who had previously been convicted of insider trading. In 2013, Bharara announced criminal and civil charges against one of the largest and most successful hedge-fund firms in the United States, SAC Capital Advisors LP, and its founder Steven A. Cohen. At USD$1.8 billion, it was the largest settlement ever for insider trading, and the firm also agreed to close down. Citibank Citibank was charged numerous times by Bharara's office and other federal prosecutors. In 2012, the bank reached a settlement with Bharara's office to pay $158 million for misleading the government into insuring risky loans. Bharara also made a criminal inquiry into Citbank's Mexican Unit. In 2014, Citi settled with federal prosecutors for $7 billion for ignoring warnings on risky loans. JPMorgan Chase Almost as soon as he took office, Bharara began investigating the role of Bernie Madoff's primary banker, JPMorgan Chase, in the fraud. Eventually Bharara and JPMorgan reached a deferred prosecution agreement that called for JPMorgan to forfeit $1.7 billion, the largest forfeiture ever demanded from a bank in American history‚Äîto settle charges that it and its predecessors violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to alert authorities about Madoff's actions.JP Morgan to pay $1.7bn to victims of the Madoff fraud BBC January 7, 2014Text of deferred prosecution agreement in Madoff caseProtess, Ben; Silver-Greenberg, Jessica. JPMorgan Faces Possible Penalty in Madoff Case. The New York Times, October 23, 2013. His office also handled the criminal prosecutions of several employees at Madoff‚Äôs firm and their associates, who were convicted by a jury on March 24, 2014. Bank of America In 2012, federal prosecutors under Bharara sued Bank of America for $1 billion, accusing the bank of carrying out a mortgage scheme that defrauded the government during the depths of the financial crisis. In 2013, the jury found Bank of America liable for selling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac thousands of defective loans in the first mortgage- fraud case brought by the U.S. government to go to trial. The civil verdict also found the bank‚Äôs Countrywide Financial unit and former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone liable. However, in 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the finding of fact by the jury that low- quality mortgages were supplied by Countrywide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac supported only \\"intentional breach of contract,\\" not fraud. The action, for civil fraud, relied on provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The decision turned on lack of intent to defraud at the time the contract to supply mortgages was made.  Russian money laundering fraud  In 2013, Bharara began investigating a money laundering fraud scheme in New York City operated by a Russian criminal organization. The alleged fraud links a $230 million Russian tax refund fraud scheme from 2008 to eleven U.S. real estate corporations. The underlying tax refund fraud was first discovered by whistleblower and Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who was arrested under tax evasion charges, and within a year he was found dead in his prison cell‚Äîa suspicious circumstance. Bharara and his office stated that some of the illicit proceeds were laundered in the U.S. by purchasing luxury Manhattan and Brooklyn real estate, including a 35-story block that has a pool, roof terrace, Turkish bath and indoor golf course. One of the companies named in the complaint, Prevezon, at the time had assets that included four condo units in the Financial District, each valued close to or in excess of $1 million, a $4.4-million condo at 250 East 49th Street in Turtle Bay, and an unknown amount of funds on deposit in eight separate Bank of America accounts in the name of different limited-liability companies registered in New York. In April 2013, Bharara gave the authorization to the FBI for the raid on Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov's apartment in Trump Tower. In April 2013, the case was personal for Bharara after Russia included him on the list 18 U.S. individuals banned from entering Russia in retaliation to the Magnitsky act. On September 10, 2013, with help from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement‚Äôs Homeland Security Investigations and Cyrus Vance Jr., the District Attorney for New York County, Bharara's office announced that they had filed a civil forfeiture complaint, freezing $24 million in assets. If the court upholds the complaint, the government will seize the assets. Holocaust survivor fund fraud During his first year in office, Bharara charged 17 managers and employees of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims for defrauding Germany $42.5 million by creating thousands of false benefit applications for people who did not suffer in the Holocaust. The fraud, which had been going on for 16 years, was related to the $400 million which Germany pays out each year to Holocaust survivors. Art fraud During his time in office, Bharara oversaw multiple notable art-fraud cases including the $80-million Knoedler Gallery case which was the largest art-fraud scheme in American history involving forged masterworks of artists Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell and others. Bharara brought charges in the $2.5-million case of John Re, a man from East Hampton, New York, who sold forged artwork by Jackson Pollock and othersEmma G. Fitzsimmons, \\"Seller of Art Fakes Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud,\\" New York Times, Dec. 1, 2014 and was sentenced to five years in federal prison.T.E. McMorrow, \\"Sentenced in Fake-Pollock Scam; John D. Re gets five years from federal judge for bilking unwary buyers,\\" East Hampton Star, May 14, 2015 Also Bharara charged Eric Spoutz, an American art dealer, with selling hundreds of fake paintings falsely attributed to American masters. Spoutz was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to forfeit the $1.45 million he made from the scheme and to pay $154,100 in restitution.\\"Forging Papers to Sell Fake Art,\\" Federal Bureau of Investigation (press release), April 6, 2017 Toyota deferred prosecution In March 2014, the U.S. Attorney's Office charged Toyota by information with one count of wire fraud for lying to consumers about two safety-related issues in the company‚Äôs cars, each of which caused unintended acceleration. Under the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that Toyota entered into the same day the information was filed, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2-billion financial penalty, the largest criminal penalty ever imposed on an auto manufacturer. The company also admitted the truth of a detailed statement of facts accompanying the DPA, and agreed to submit to a three-year monitorship. =Public corruption= Bharara has said that \\"there is no prosecutor‚Äôs office in the state that takes more seriously the responsibility to root out public corruption in Albany and anywhere else that we might find it, and I think our record speaks for itself.\\" During his tenure, Bharara has charged several current and former elected officials in public corruption cases, including Senator Vincent Leibell, Senator Hiram Monserrate, NYC Councilman Larry Seabrook, and Yonkers City Councilwoman Sandy Annabi. Bharara‚Äôs office uncovered an alleged corruption ring involving New York State Senator Carl Kruger. In April 2012, Kruger was sentenced to seven years in prison. In February 2011, Bharara announced the indictment of five consultants working on New York City‚Äôs electronic payroll and timekeeping project, CityTime, for misappropriating more than $80 million from the project. The investigation has expanded with five additional defendants being charged, including a consultant who allegedly received more than $5 million in illegal kickbacks on the projects. In early 2013, Bharara oversaw the conviction of New York City Police Department officer Gilberto Valle, who was part of an alleged plot to rape and then cook and eat (cannibalize) women. Bharara and his team argued that Valle had done more than hypothesize, think, or speculate (in online networks where such fantasies are discussed), but had moved on from being a possible danger to others to the criminal planning phase and had even visited the street where one of the women lived, at the behest of another defendant. However, the defense and others who objected to the verdict argued that all he had done was fantasize, not plan, and that such thoughts or online posts, however twisted, were still protected. The defense team (Robert Baum and Julia L. Gatto) may ask the judge to set aside the verdict, or may appeal. If he does keep the felony conviction and is sentenced, Valle would automatically no longer serve in law enforcement.NYC policeman convicted in plot to kidnap, cook women ‚Äì News ‚Äì Journal Star ‚Äì Peoria, IL. Pjstar.com (March 12, 2013). Retrieved on December 26, 2013. On April 2, 2013, Bharara unsealed federal corruption charges against New York State Senator Malcolm A. Smith, New York City Councilman Dan Halloran and several other Republican party officials. The federal complaint alleged that Smith attempted to secure a spot on the Republican ballot in the 2013 New York City mayoral election through bribery. New York Moreland Commission In 2014, Bharara's office began an inquiry into Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to end the work of the Moreland Commission, an anticorruption panel. After a New York Times report documenting Cuomo's staff's involvement with the commission and subsequent statements by commissioners defending the Governor, Bharara warned of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver Bharara made national headlines after investigating 11-term Speaker of the New York State Assembly Sheldon Silver for taking millions of dollars in payoffs, leading to Silver's arrest in January 2015. Silver was subsequently convicted on all counts, triggering his automatic expulsion from the Assembly. Silver was replaced by the first African-American speaker Carl Heastie. During the Silver prosecution, Judge Valerie Caproni criticized Bharara's public statements, writing that \\"while castigating politicians in Albany for playing fast and loose with the ethical rules that govern their conduct, Bharara strayed so close to the edge of the rules governing his own conduct.\\" =Gang crimes and organized crime= From 2009 to 2014, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has convicted more than 1,000 of approximately 1,300 people charged in 52 large-scale takedowns of street drug and drug trafficking organizations. On lowering violent crime rates, Bharara has said, \\"You can measure the number of people arrested and the number of shootings, but success is when you lift the sense of intimidation and fear.\\" Bharara also oversaw the largest criminal sweep of gangs in Newburgh, New York, working with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement agencies to bring charges against members of the Newburgh Bloods and Newburgh Latin Kings gangs, among others. In 2010, Bharara oversaw the prosecution of eight longshoremen on charges of participation in a multimillion-dollar cocaine trafficking enterprise along the Waterfront, operated by a Panamanian drug organization.John Eligon, 8 Longshoremen Charged With Smuggling Cocaine, New York Times (October 5, 2010).Scott Shifrel, Longshoremen busted for helping push a ton of Panamanian cocaine through NY, NJ port, New York Times (October 5, 2010). In January 2011, Bharara's office participated in a multi-state organized crime takedown, charging 26 members of the Gambino crime family with racketeering and murder, as well as narcotics and firearms charges. This action was part of a coordinated effort that also involved arrests in Brooklyn; Newark, New Jersey, and Providence, Rhode Island; according to the FBI, this was the largest single-day operation against the Mafia in U.S. history. *91 Leaders, Members and Associates of La Cosa Nostra Families in Four Districts Charged with Racketeering and Related Crimes, Including Murder and Extortion, United States Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs (January 20, 2011). *William K.

At a news conference on September 7, 2016 following the arrests of Shimen Liebowitz and Aharon Goldberg, 2 rabbis implicated in the Kiryas Joel murder conspiracy, Bharara called it a \\"chilling plot,\\" wherein the plotters \\"met repeatedly to plan the kidnapping and to pay more than $55,000 to an individual they believed would carry it out.\\"Gajanan, Mahita (September 7, 2016). \\"Rabbi and Orthodox Jewish Man Plotted to Kidnap and Murder Husband to Get Divorce for his Wife, Officials Say\\", Time(September 7, 2016). \\"Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Arrest of Rabbi and Member of Satmar Community for Conspiring to Kidnap and Murder\\", United States Department of Justice The rabbis were convicted and sentenced to prison in 2017.Eberhart, Christopher J.

In a 2014 interview, Bharara said the historical record would show that \\"greater transparency and openness and legitimacy\\" leads to \\"more serious and appropriate punishment.\\" Citing his success in terrorism trials, Bharara stated: \\"These trials have been difficult, but they have been fair and open and prompt...in an American civilian courtroom, the American people and all the victims of terrorism can be vindicated without sacrificing our principles.\\"Benjamin Wesier, Life Sentence for British Cleric Who Helped Plan 1998 Kidnappings in Yemen, New York Times (January 9, 2015).

Bharara also won a conviction and 25-year sentence for international arms smuggler Viktor Bout. =Cybercrime= In June 2012, The New York Times published an op-ed written by Bharara about the threat posed to private industry by cybercrime and encouraged corporate leaders to take preventive measures and create contingency plans. Bharara's tenure saw a number of notable prosecutions for computer hacking: *Bharara's office worked with Hector Xavier Monsegur (\\"Sabu\\"), a computer hacker who later became a federal informant. Because Monsegur's cooperation \\"helped the authorities infiltrate the shadowy world of computer hacking and disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks on targets that included the United States military,\\" Bharara's office recommended a greatly reduced sentence to the judge, and in 2014 Monsegur was freed with time served.Benjamin Weiser, Hacker Who Helped Disrupt Cyberattacks Is Allowed to Walk Free, New York Times (May 27, 2014). *In May 2014, Bharara's office was part of an international crackdown, led by the FBI and authorities in 19 countries, on the \\"Blackshades\\" creepware hacking, in which hackers illicitly access users' systems remotely to steal information.Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz & Tom Cohen, More than 90 people nabbed in global hacker crackdown, CNN (May 19, 2014). *In November 2015, Bharara's office charged three Israeli men in a 23-count indictment that alleged that they ran an extensive computer hacking and fraud scheme that targeted JPMorgan Chase, The Wall Street Journal, and ten other companies.

Bharara moved to shut down several of the world's largest Internet poker companies.Nathan Vardi, U.S. Government Moves To Shut Down World's Biggest Online Poker Companies, Forbes (April 15, 2011). He prosecuted several payment processors for Internet poker companies, securing guilty pleas for money laundering.Payment Processor for Internet Poker Companies Pleads Guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to Bank Fraud, Money Laundering, and Gambling Offenses (press release), U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (February 28, 2012)Payment Processor for Online Poker Companies Pleads Guilty to Laundering Internet Poker Funds (press release), U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (January 12, 2012) In April 2011, Bharara charged 11 founding members of internet gambling companies and their associates involved with pay processing with bank fraud, money laundering and illegal gambling under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). The case is United States v. Scheinberg. =Devyani Khobragade incident= Bharara and his office came to the limelight again in December 2013 with the arrest of Devyani Khobragade, the Deputy Consul General of India in New York, who was accused by prosecutors of submitting false work visa documents for her housekeeper and paying the housekeeper \\"far less than the minimum legal wage.\\" The ensuing incident caused protests from the Indian government and a rift in India‚ÄìUnited States relations; Indians expressed outrage that Khobragade was strip-searched (a routine practice for all U.S. Marshals Service arrestees) and held in the general inmate population. The Indian government retaliated for what it viewed as the mistreatment of its consular official by revoking the ID cards and other privileges of U.S. consular personnel and their families in India and removing security barriers in front of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. Khobragade was subject to prosecution at the time of her arrest because she had only consular immunity (which gives one immunity from prosecution only for acts committed in connection with official duties) and not the more extensive diplomatic immunity.Tara McKelvey, Who, What, Why: Does Devyani Khobragade have diplomatic immunity?, BBC News (December 19, 2013).

Forrest of the Southern District of New York like \\"Its [sic] judges like these that should be taken out back and shot\\" and \\"Why waste ammunition? Wood chippers get the message across clearly.\\" (The comments were made under an article in the magazine of Forrest's sentencing of Silk Road owner Ross William Ulbricht to life in prison without parole.) In June 2015, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena to the libertarian magazine, demanding that it provide identifying information for the commenters. Following the issuance of the subpoena, federal prosecutors applied for an order from a U.S. magistrate judge forbidding the magazine from disclosing the existence of the subpoena to the commenters. The subpoena became public after being obtained by Popehat's Ken White. The nondisclosure order caused controversy, with critics saying that it infringed the constitutional right to free speechStephanie Clifford, Prosecutors' Secrecy Orders on Subpoenas Stir Constitutional Questions, New York Times (January 1, 2016). and questioning whether the comments were actually serious threats or merely hyperbolic \\"trolling.\\"  Federal prosecutors dropped the matter as moot.

Its alteration into a poncho-like clothing item is more recent. The sarape or jorongo is a long blanket-like shawl, often brightly colored and fringed at the ends, worn in Mexico, especially by men. The spelling of the word sarape Real Academia Espa√±ola (or infrequently, zarape) is the accepted form in Mexico and in other Spanish-speaking countries. The term sarape is for the rectangular woven blanket (no openings), though in more recent years it can also be used to refer to a very soft rectangular blanket with an opening in the middle for one's head, similar to a poncho called gab√°n, or jorongo in Mexico. Modern variations of some serapes are made with matching hoods for head covering. The length varies, but front and back normally reach knee height on an average person. Available in various colors and design patterns, the typical colors of serapes from the highland regions are two-tone combinations of black, grey, brown, or tan depending on the natural color of the sheep flocks grown in the area, with large design patterns utilizing traditional indigenous motifs. On the other hand, the traditional serape as made in the Mexican state of Coahuila in north-eastern Mexico near the city of Saltillo often consists of a dark base color with bands of yellow, orange, red, blue, green, purple or other bright colors. The ends are usually fringed. History The sarape is thought to have its forebears in garments worn in the region near Chiautempan and Contla, Tlaxcala. During the Colonial period, it was taken to northern New Spain where it was adapted to the climate and the motifs changed. The city of Saltillo is strongly linked to the development of the sarape, although it was widespread throughout the area then known as Nueva Vizcaya. Guatemalan serape The serape is not a typical garment for the Maya highland people, who wear different clothing in cold regions. The serape is more of an imitation of the Mexican serape with a Maya twist, and their production is specifically for sales to foreigners or city dwellers who feel attracted to the garment. The sale of sarapes goes through a broker process, where the Maya families, who depend mostly upon agricultural work, manufacture small quantities for additional income. The brokers display the sarapes at a higher price on local markets or the sides of highland roads in improvised huts. The brokers are typically Maya. The appeal of the sarape may consist in the fact that these are woven by Maya families, normally women, in their traditional house looms, giving the sarape a \\"handmade\\" look.

There are two basic types of wine auctions: first hand wine auctions, where wineries sell their own wines, and second hand wine auctions, arranged by auction houses or other auctioneers to make it possible for any owners of wine to trade it. In most cases, the wines traded at wine auctions are collectible wine, so-called \\"fine wine\\". These are wines which are typically suitable for extended cellaring, and where some of the buyers are looking for mature wines which are no longer available through first-hand retail channels. First hand auctions First hand wine auctions are usually arranged by wine industry organisations, and fill promotional or charitable purposes, or are used to gauge the market. The wines sold at such auctions are usually special lot wines, or back vintages stored by the producers. An example of such auctions is the annual wine auction held by Hospices de Beaune in Burgundy, where Burgundy wines from vineyards donated to the Hospices de Beaune are auctioned off by the barrel, and often bought by n√©gociants who bottle and sell the wines to the consumer market. Another example are the German wine auctions where mostly special lot wines are sold, and are bought by a combination of private wine collectors and wine dealers. Second hand auctions Second hand wine auctions are arranged by many major auction houses, such as Christie's and Sotheby's. Prices for many wines at these auctions are used as a price indication for collectible wine when traded through other channels, such as First Growth Bordeaux wines sold by rare wine dealers, or when n√©gociants sell mature wines from their stock to restaurants. Online wine auctions Online wine auctions have existed since the 1990s. Online wine auctions generally sell fine wines, or collectible wines, that are consigned by private individuals. Like traditional auction houses, online wine auctions make money by charging commissions to both the buyers and sellers of wine. In 2018 the total sales for online wine auctions was $74.9 million. In 2018 the total sales for all auctions of collectible wines, including online and traditional auctions, was $479.1 million. Ranked by 2018 sales, the leading online wine auctions are: WineBid, $31 million; Spectrum, $10 million; Acker Merrall & Condit, $9.3 million; Zachy‚Äôs, $9.3 million; and Hart Davis Hart, $9.2 million.

Prom Night in Mississippi is a 2009 Canadian-American documentary film written and directed by Paul Saltzman. The documentary follows a group of 2008 Charleston High School high school seniors in Charleston, Mississippi as they prepare for their senior prom, the first racially integrated prom in Charleston history. Background and production The prom was funded by Morgan Freeman, a Charleston resident, and exposed racial tension in the town, mainly among administrators and parents of the students of the high school. Filmed on location in Mississippi, Prom Night in Mississippi was directed by Canadian director Paul Saltzman with his wife Patricia Aquino acting as producer. It was filmed over a four-month period on a budget of $750,000 of the director's own money. The crew shot over 165 hours of footage, 89 minutes of which were used in the final version. It was shown on HBO, premiered in Toronto on November 12, 2009, and had its theatrical release on December 11, 2009. Documentary The documentary is about the senior prom in Charleston, Mississippi. The high school in Charleston (a community of 2,100 residents) has an average of 80 graduates per year, and up until 2008 had separate, segregated proms for black students and white students, despite Mississippi fully integrating their schools in 1970. In 1997 Morgan Freeman (a resident of Charleston since 1991) approached the school and offered to pay for the prom, provided it be racially integrated. The school declined Freeman's offer. In 2008 Freeman offered again, and the school agreed to move forward with an integrated prom. Saltzman follows a group of students, both black and white, over four months as they prepare for their senior prom. The students discuss segregation in Charleston and how they feel about it. The documentary also explores issues such as interracial relationships, and what the parents think about an integrated prom. The integrated prom is successful despite some parents' forbidding their children to attend it. The film brought some racial tension to the town of Charleston, mostly from the parents and school authorities concerned with \\"tradition and security issues\\", with a group of parents planning a separate prom for white students only.

Instead, the judge sentenced him to four or five years in jail.Allison says, \\"four,\\" and Minter says, \\"five.\\" When the sentence was given, Turner responded by knocking down the bailiff and running away. He was caught when he fell into an open coal pit, and when brought back to court, he was sentenced to the chain gang. In his first of nine escapes, Turner used a razor blade and black shoe polish to make a fake pistol out of orange crate wood. Another time, after he escaped, he came back, posing as an attorney, and led the entire population of inmates in a mass escape. In 1938, the State of Georgia dedicated Tattnal Prison in Reidsville, an \\"escape-proof\\" facility, and placed Turner there. Turner spent months using automobile valve-grinding compound and piano wire to cut through the bars of his cell. Once out, he released two other prisoners, and the three of them took over the prison switchboard, from which they sent guards to various locations in the prison, ambushed them, and tied them up. Finally, they took a truck and left with 43 prisoners. When he was recaptured, his combined sentences totaled 125 years. He was assigned to the \\"eight-ball squad,\\" prisoners who performed hard labor while chained to iron balls. Then, a new director of the State Department of Corrections, Wiley L. Moore, abolished the \\"eight-ball squad,\\" and offered Turner a prison job in the dental laboratory. In 1946, Turner was transferred from the state system to the Fulton County Prison, where he became assistant to Chaplain Bill Allison. The publicity surrounding Turner led the parole board and the governor to reexamine his case, determining that he had never committed a serious crime, if any crime. In March, 1949, Georgia Governor Ellis Arnall commuted his sentence, and he was released. Life as a community citizen Turner opened a dental laboratory business in Jonesboro (Clayton County), Georgia, and gained a reputation for providing dentures free or \\"at cost\\" for people who could not afford them. He also signed personal custody for \\"hundreds of parolees, of whom only a handful had to go back to jail.\\" When a detective who had arrested him several times died, Turner served as a pallbearer. In 1970, Turner was arrested for practicing dentistry without a license, and the case concluded in January 1971 with a guilty verdict, fining him $500., and restricting him from doing dental work for a year.\\"Forrest Turner found guilty in dental case,\\" Atlanta Constitution, Jan. 29, 1971, p. 1-A., Later, Turner gave his explanation of the case to a friendly newspaper columnist. Regarding the license issue, he told the columnist that he, himself, had advocated licensing of dental laboratories \\"so old people and poor people can get their false teeth made less expensively,\\" but because of his advocacy, dentists were \\"out to get him.\\" He was arrested after had made teeth for a man who turned out to be a Georgia Bureau of Investigation informant. There were also claims that investigators had found drugs. Regarding this, he told the columnist, \\"It's been embarrassing. One of the papers said I was arrested with some drugs. It was some old Novocain that came in a dentist's bag a friend gave me some time ago. But it sounded like I was a pusher or something, and I've felt bad because I do a lot of work with young kids and I keep expecting one of them to come up with something like, 'Daddy-o, what are you on?'\\"Sibley, Celestine, \\"Forrest Turner Is Different,\\" The Atlanta Constitution, February 24, 1971, p. 5-A.

He lost both times.\\"Turner pays fee to run for house,\\" Atlanta Constitution, Oct. 8, 1971, p. 8-A.Atlanta Constitution, June 30, 1975, p. 7-A.

Jacob states the allegory was one of the teachings of Zenos found in the brass plates, a lost record. Latter Day Saints suggest that it is possible that Paul in his Epistle to the Romans is referencing a similar parable. The Parable The master of a vineyard grew a tame olive tree, but in time it grew old and began to decay. In hopes of saving it he pruned it, dug the ground and nourished it. In time some new branches appeared, but the top of the tree began to perish. So the master of the vineyard instructed his servant to cut off the decayed branches, and replace them with grafts of wild olives. Meanwhile, natural branches of the tree were transplanted to other parts of the vineyard. In time the original tree, now with wild olive branches grafted onto it, grew to give good fruit. Those natural branches of the original tree that were transplanted into poor soil also grew to give good fruit. However, a natural branch of the original tree that was transplanted into good soil grew to give a mix of good and poor fruit. The master of the vineyard instructed his servant to cut off the branches of this tree that gave poor fruit, and burn them. However, the servant suggested to that master that with further care this tree too might bring forth good fruit. And so the master and his servant worked diligently at nourishing all the trees. After a long time the master and servant returned to the vineyard, and found that all trees, both the original and the transplants, had failed, and had all grown only poor fruit. Bitterly disappointed, \\"the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?\\" (Jacob 5:41). The master determined to burn all the trees in the vineyard, since all had given only evil fruit. Again the servant begged for clemency, and the master was persuaded, being reluctant to lose the vineyard he loved so much. The master decided to cut out those branches of wild olives that he had grafted onto the original tree that gave the most bitter fruit, and replace them with branches from the daughter trees that had grown from the previously transplanted cuttings. The master hoped that by bringing the branches and roots of the original tree back together, they would grow good fruit. The master and his servants worked hard in the vineyard. They cut out the branches that brought forth evil fruit and burnt them, and pruned and nourished the trees, and dug the ground. After much hard work, there was no longer any bad fruit in the vineyard. \\"And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning. And blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.\\" () The parable ends with a warning from the master of the vineyard that the next time the vineyard grows poor fruit, he will simply gather in the good fruit, throw away the poor fruit, and set the vineyard to flames. This is in the come follow me manual. Jacob 5-7. Interpretation of the Parable As with many other stories and parables, the parable of the olive tree can be interpreted as a commentary on life in general. However, in context, the parable is an allegory of Israel's relationship with Jesus over thousands of years of history. The lord of the vineyard is Jesus, the vineyard is the world, the olive branches are groups or families of people, and the olive fruits are the lives and works of men. The original tree appears to represent the nation of Israel and its roots the pure Gospel. The wild olive branches grafted in to the original tree represent the preaching of the Gospel of Christ to Gentile nations and their conversion or baptism into the Church of Christ. The transplanted branches represent scattered Israel including the House of Lehi in the New World giving rise to both good and bad fruits. The good fruits might refer to the Nephites and poor fruits to the Lamanites considering that the Nephites were typically followers of Christ and the Lamanites typically not. Although notice that the bad fruits are burned in the end, which might correspond to the destruction of the Nephite nation. (The Lamanite nation was not destroyed.) The bringing of the branches and roots back together represent the gathering of all the scattered tribes of Israel back into fellowship in Israel or Christ's church.

The nvcc compiler translates code written in CUDA, a C++-like language, into PTX instructions, and the graphics driver contains a compiler which translates the PTX instructions into a binary code which can be run on the processing cores of Nvidia GPUs. The GNU Compiler Collection also has basic ability for PTX generation in the context of OpenMP offloading. Inline PTX assembly can be used in CUDA.  Registers  PTX uses an arbitrarily large register set; the output from the compiler is almost pure single-assignment form, with consecutive lines generally referring to consecutive registers. Programs start with declarations of the form .reg .u32 %r<335>; // declare 335 registers %r0, %r1, ..., %r334 of type unsigned 32-bit integer It is a three-argument assembly language, and almost all instructions explicitly list the data type (in terms of sign and width) on which they operate. Register names are preceded with a % character and constants are literal, e.g.: shr.u64 %rd14, %rd12, 32; // shift right an unsigned 64-bit integer from %rd12 by 32 positions, result in %rd14 cvt.u64.u32 %rd142, %r112; // convert an unsigned 32-bit integer to 64-bit There are predicate registers, but compiled code in shader model 1.0 uses these only in conjunction with branch commands; the conditional branch is @%p14 bra $label; // branch to $label The \`setp.cc.type\` instruction sets a predicate register to the result of comparing two registers of appropriate type, there is also a \`set\` instruction, where set.le.u32.u64 %r101, %rd12, %rd28 sets the 32-bit register \`%r101\` to \`0xffffffff\` if the 64-bit register \`%rd12\` is less than or equal to the 64-bit register \`%rd28\`. Otherwise \`%r101\` is set to \`0x00000000\`. There are a few predefined identifiers that denote pseudoregisters. Among others, \`%tid, %ntid, %ctaid\`, and \`%nctaid\` contain, respectively, thread indices, block dimensions, block indices, and grid dimensions.  State spaces  Load (\`ld\`) and store (\`st\`) commands refer to one of several distinct state spaces (memory banks), e.g. \`ld.param\`. There are eight state spaces: * \`.reg\` : registers * \`.sreg\` : special, read-only, platform-specific registers * \`.const\` : shared, read-only memory * \`.global\` : global memory, shared by all threads * \`.local\` : local memory, private to each thread * \`.param\` : parameters passed to the kernel * \`.shared\` : memory shared between threads in a block * \`.tex\` : global texture memory (deprecated) Shared memory is declared in the PTX file via lines at the start of the form: .shared .align 8 .b8 pbatch_cache[15744]; // define 15,744 bytes, aligned to an 8-byte boundary Writing kernels in PTX requires explicitly registering PTX modules via the CUDA Driver API, typically more cumbersome than using the CUDA Runtime API and NVIDIA's CUDA compiler, nvcc. The GPU Ocelot project provided an API to register PTX modules alongside CUDA Runtime API kernel invocations, though the GPU Ocelot is no longer actively maintained.

Affected by the style naive art he worked particularly as a graphic artist and as an Illustrator of children's books. Besides this he painted pictures in the style of naive art. Referred to as a \\"na√Øve\\" painter, his works exhibit a dry wit and refreshingly candid, satirical view of life.  Life  = Childhood = Balet was son of German/Dutch parents. 1916 after the divorce of his parents he and his mother moved to live with his mother's parents Langenargen at Lake Constance in Germany. His grandfather was the senior judicial counsellor in the areaEduard Eggert and his uncle was the famous painter and illustrator Benno Eggert. Many well-known personalities of the time were friends of his grandfather, i.e. the painters Hans Purrmann, Karl Caspar, Maria Caspar-Filser (cousin of his mother), the writer Martin Andersen Nexo, the Swabian poet Wilhelm Schussen as well as the poet and writer Oskar W√∂hrle, Balets godfather. 1920 his grandfather sold the house in Langenargen and the family moved to Friedrichshafen at Lake Constance. = School time = In 1920 Balet started school. Because his mother and his grandmother had difficulties bringing him up after the death of his grandfather in 1926 Balet was sent to boarding school in GermanySchule Schloss Salem. In 1927 Balet moved to Hansa Home, a strictly catholic institution in Munich and attended grammar school. In order to take up an apprenticeship with a painter shop Balet left school before finishing sixth class. He cut the apprenticeship short, leaving before the end of the second year. = Studies = In 1929, at the age of 17, he moved to Berlin at the invitation of his father and studied Drawing at the college of Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbeschule Ost am Schlesischen Bahnhof). A year later, he went to live with his mother and his grandmother, in Munich. Balet transferred his studies to the Munich College of Arts but was dismissed in 1932. He went on to study with Professor Ege, at a private school for commercial art. During this time he also worked at an institute for lithography and for the art gallery Wallach. Balet rented his first small studio at the age of nineteen, where he manufactured and sold hand colored Bavarian woodcuts. 1934 he passed the entrance examination to the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen and undertook further studies with Olaf Gulbransson. = Emigration to the USA = In early 1938 Balet was recruited by the German military and because his ancestor's passport was not complete, he was forbidden to associate further with the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen. Later that year Balet emigrated to the USA, settled in New York and painted rustic furniture for a living. One winter he jobbed as a skiing teacher in Vermont and occasionally jobbed as an advertising commercial artist. Among other projects, he painted the cafeteria of the largest of New York's department stores R.H. Macy. He married a young woman named Bertha Quinn and in 1940 his son Peter was born. From time to time Balet's designs appeared in the fashion magazine Mademoiselle and in 1943 he became Art Director at the magazine. Balet became so successful as a commercial artist that he was able to give up paid employment and start his own business. He worked for the radio station CBS, magazines such as Vogue, House and Garden, House Beautiful, The Saturday Evening Post, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, This week. After the war ended in 1945 he acquired U.S. citizenship. In 1945 Balet and his wife divorced and Peter and his mother went to live with her parents in Ballston Spa, NY. Balet commuted between his studio in New York and an old, boat house in the dunes of Montauk, Long Island, which he had converted to a studio where he painted and drew. His first children's book Amos and the Moon was published in 1948. Soon after he travelled to Europe to visit his mother and his grandmother in Munich and then spent two months in Paris, which provided great inspiration for his future work. His grandmother died in 1949 at the age of 93 years and Balet said she had been \\"the most important and dearest person\\" in his life. Around this time Balet began a relationship with American photo model Lisa Tallal, whom he married a few years later. Balet sold his boat house and purchased his dream house, also on Long Island. Balet and his wife enjoyed an expensive lifestyle which required him to focus on commercial art. During travels to Europe and Mexico Balet took many photographs, since there was insufficient time for drawing. Despite what was regarded in the USA as fashionable art Abstract, Op-art and Popart Balet continued to paint in his own style. His mother died in 1963 and he inherited the house in Munich. As a former pupil of Olaf Gulbransson, Balet was invited, in 1964, to present an exhibition in the Pavillon Alter Botanischer Garten Munich. Many of his children's books and illustrations were included in the exhibition as well as a variety of his commercial artwork. This encouraged Balet to keep on painting in his special style. = Return to Europe = 1965 Balet and his wife Lisa divorced and he returned to Munich where he started to illustrate children's books again, to paint his impressions of his various journeys and to hold exhibitions of his work. In 1973 he settled in the countryside with Claudia (Gerda) C. Foth, in La Landelle in France. Balet enjoyed increasing success with painting and stopped working as a commercial artist. In 1976 Balet received an order from an art dealer to make a number of lithographs annually in Switzerland. Circle Fine Art arranged several exhibitions of these in many different countries. Baletand his wife, Claudia, moved to Estavayer le Lac on Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland in 1978 so he would not have to travel so far to Zurch to work on his lithographs. Coincidentally his father's family originally came from this area where Balet is a common family name.

He was sentenced to death for the murder of a labourer called John Spicer from Kent. The Recorder of London, James Adair, described it as a \\"robbery with violence\\" that involved \\"cutting and wounding [...] in a cruel manner.\\" This hanging would mark the end of Tyburn, a village then in the county of Middlesex, being a place of executions for almost 600 years. Austin was brought from Newgate prison in the City of London by cart to the gallows. The 2¬Ω mile journey along Tyburn Road would have taken up to three hours. Standing shackled in the cart, he would have been accompanied by two guards and a chaplain. They would traditionally stop on the way at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate and two public houses where drinks would be served. On arrival at Tyburn, Austin's cart would have been positioned under a beam and a noose attached around his head. He would then be permitted to address the crowd, his last words were: :\\"Good people, I request your prayers for the salvation of my departing soul. Let my example teach you to shun the bad ways I have followed. Keep good company, and mind the word of God. Lord have mercy on me. Jesus look down with pity on me. Christ have mercy on my poor soul!\\" However, for Austin the noose slipped up the back of his neck, and as the cart was taken from under him the slackness in the rope prevented rapid asphyxiation. It was said it took 10 minutes for him to choke to death. As Austin was a murderer, his body was cut down and sent for formal dissection by The Company of Surgeons at the Surgeon's Hall in the Old Bailey. The gallows were dismantled after the execution. Future public hangings were now conducted on a scaffold named the \\"new drop\\" outside the Newgate.

It is considered to be one of the most difficult and dangerous contortion positions, and is usually the climax during a contortion performance. Etymology This name comes from the contortionist and international theatrical agent H.B. Marinelli (1864-1924).https://travsd.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/stars-of- vaudeville-624-h-b-marinelli/ Retrieved on Apr 1, 2015. Double Marinelli bend  This is a Marinelli bend in which the contortionist performs a Marinelli position with another contortionist doing a handstand on their top so that the former is holding the weight of two persons only by their mouth. This is considered to be an extremely difficult contortion act, and is exclusively performed by Mongolian or sometimes Chinese contortionists. The bend normally lasts for 5‚Äì6 seconds from the moment the Marinelli bend contortionist releases their hands from the floor. Triple Marinelli bend  This is a Marinelli bend in which the contortionist performs a Marinelli position with two other contortionists on their top so that the one in Marinelli bend is holding the weight of three persons only by their mouth. From all available documented records only one trio of contortionists have managed to do achieve it.  Spinning Marinelli bend  This is a Marinelli bend in which the contortionist performs a Marinelli position on specially built equipment that can slowly spin 360 degrees.

Often, these overall declines in the population are influenced by low fertility rates. When fertility is lower than the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman and there is a longer life expectancy, this changes the age structure over time. United Nations. Department of Economic and Social Affairs.Population Division. Replacement Migration: Is it a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations? vol. no. 206., United Nations, New York, 2001. Overall, the population will start to decline as there will not be enough children born to replace the population of people lost and the proportion of older individuals composing the population will continue to increase. One concern from this is that the age-dependency ratio will be affected, as the working-age population will have more dependents in older age to support. Therefore, replacement migration has been a proposed mechanism to try and combat declining population size, aging populations and help replenish the number of people in the working age groups. Projections calculating migration replacement are primarily demographics and theoretical exercises and not forecasts or recommendations. However, this demographic information can help prompt governments to facilitate replacement migration by making policy changes. Bijak, Jakub, et al. ‚ÄúReplacement Migration Revisited: Simulations of the Effects of Selected Population and Labor Market Strategies for the Aging Europe, 2002-2052.‚Äù Population Research and Policy Review, vol. 27, no. 3, 2008, pp. 321‚Äì342. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41217953. The concept of replacement migration may vary according to the study and depending on the context in which it applies. It may be a number of annual immigrants, a net migration,https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/ReplMigED/migration.htm an additional number of immigrants compared to a reference scenario, etc.  Types of replacement migration  Replacement migration may take several forms because several scenarios of projections population can achieve the same aim. However, two forms predominate: minimal replacement migration and constant replacement migration. = Minimal replacement migration = Replacement migration is a minimum migration without surplus to achieve a chosen objective. This form of replacement migration may results in large fluctuations between periods. Its calculation will obviously depend on the chosen objective. For example, Marois (2008) calculates the gross number of immigrants needed to prevent total population decline in Quebec. The formula is then the following: R_{(t)}\\\\ '=\\\\frac{-\\\\Delta P_{(t,t+1)} }{A_{(t)} } Where: *R(t)' = Replacement Migration avoiding the decline of population in year t *A(t) = retention rate of immigrants year t, defined by (1 - instantaneous departure rate) *‚àÜP(t,t+1) = change in the total population in the time interval t, t+1 =Constant replacement migration= The constant replacement migration does not fluctuate and remains the same throughout the projection. For example, it will be calculated with a projection providing a migration of X throughout the temporal horizon.  Results  The raw results of replacement migration are not necessarily comparable depending on the type of replacement migration used by the author. Nevertheless, major demographics conclusions are recurrent: * The replacement migration reached impossible levels in practice to avoid aging the population, to maintain dependency ratio or influence significantly the age structure of a region. * For regions with a relatively high fertility rate, replacement migration avoiding a decline in the total population or the working age is not excessively high. However, for regions with very low fertility rate, migration replacement is very high and unrealistic. * The level of fertility is a much more important than the Immigration on aging and age structure. * The principal effect of immigration is on population effective without substantially modifying the structure. =Examples of results= Replacement migration to prevent the total population decline (annual average): * Germany: (net) * Canada: (number of immigrants) * United States: (net) * Europe: (net) * Japan: (net) * Quebec: (number of immigrants) * Russia (net) * Slovenia: (additional immigrants relative to the reference) Replacement migration to prevent the decline of population of working age (annual average) * Germany: (net) * Canada: (number of immigrants) * United States: (net) * Europe: (net) * Japan: (net) * Quebec: (number of immigrants) * Russia: (net) * Slovenia: (additional immigrants relative to the reference) = Criticism = Replacement migration as presented by the United Nations Population Division in 2000 is largely perceived as unrealistic as a singular way of fighting population ageing.http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/laborsupply_prospects_McDonald.pdf One reason being that replacement migration tends to only to be a temporary fix to aging populations. Instead of using replacement migration to combat declining and aging populations, government policy and social changes could be implemented. Therefore, replacement migration is said to be more useful as an analytical or hypothetical tool.http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/laborsupply_prospects_McDonald.pdf Increased migration could decrease the old age dependency ratio, which is expected to grow considerably in the next decades.http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/laborsupply_prospects_McDonald.pdf However, the immigration need to effectively counter the greying of many industrialised economies is unrealistically high.http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/pdr/PDR301Bongaarts.pdf Replacement migration is also feared to negatively impact the environment. Declining and aging populations are typically seen in more developed countries, as more developed countries have better health care infrastructure and access to education that both decreases mortality rates and subsequently fertility rates in the population. Immigrants are typically moving from areas that have less resources or economic opportunities, as access to more resources and economic prosperity can be pull factor for this migrants to move to a new country. A large influx of immigrants from an area that is low or lacks resources to a country that has more resources may change the availability of resources since there will be more people. Resources could be food, water, land, energy etc. Certain countries may be opposed to international immigration. Reasons such as xenophobia can subject new immigrants to discrimination, thus, the immigrants may have trouble assimilating to their new country. The native population of said countries may also resent and oppose the loss of national identity, homogeneous national culture, and the loss of advantages for native people that replacement immigration leads to. Advances in robotics and AI could diminish the need for migrant workers, especially in low-skilled jobs.Robots could replace migrant workers, says think-tank, Delphine Strauss, Financial Times, 4 July 2016 A 2019 paper reasserted the conclusions of the 2000 UN Population Division paper, arguing that while immigration could play a role in moderating the effects of an ageing population, the number of immigrants required to actually halt the ageing of the population (expressed in terms of maintaining the potential support ratio) was too high to be realistic.Craveiro, Daniela, Isabel Tiago de Oliveira, Maria Sousa Gomes, Jorge Malheiros, Maria Jo√£o Guardado Moreira, and Jo√£o Peixoto. \\"Back to replacement migration.\\" Demographic Research 40 (2019): 1323-1344.

Evans. The film stars Louis Gossett, Jr., Michael Higgenbottom and Michael Joiner. It was released on February 25, 2011 to 363 theaters, grossing $1 million in its opening weekend. Plot When Mac McDonald (Michael Joiner) loses his son in an accident, the ensuing 17 years of bitterness and pain erodes his love for his family and leaves him angry with almost everyone, including God. Mac's rage damages his career in the police department, and his household is as frightening as anything he encounters on the streets of Memphis. Money is tight, arguments with his wife are common, and his surviving son Blake is hanging with the wrong crowd and in danger of failing school. Things become heated when Mac is partnered with Sam Wright (Mike Higgenbottom), a rising star on the force who happens to be a part-time pastor and a family man. Sam never expected to be a police officer. He feels called to be a minister like his grandfather. In addition to leading a small, start-up church, Sam works as a police officer to provide for his family. When he gets promoted to Sergeant, however, Sam starts questioning if his true calling might be police work. Can Sam and Mac somehow join forces or is it nearly impossible for either of them to look past their differences, especially their race? Production Filming for The Grace Card began in Memphis, Tennessee on October 14, 2009. The climax of the film was shot at Messiah Missionary Baptist Church on Chelsea. Other locations included St. Francis Hospital and the downtown banks of the Mississippi River. Screenwriter Howard Klausner explained, \\"We look at this project as Fireproof 2.0. The Sherwood Baptist guys have opened up a door for all of us, proving that faith-based features can stand up in the marketplace... Maybe it‚Äôs just because so few films coming out of Hollywood reflect the values we [Christians] hold dear.\\" The Calvary Church of the Nazarene in Cordova was the film's \\"sponsoring church.\\" Church volunteers worked in the catering, wardrobe, hair and makeup departments, in addition to the professional filmmakers who handled the film's technical aspects. Director David Evans said about 90 percent of the 40 full-time crew members were mid- Southerners, as were almost all the 100-plus supporting actors and extras. They volunteered more than 10,000 hours, and the film was shot in 28 days. Release On its opening day of wide release, The Grace Card grossed $360,000, and its opening weekend was $1,010,299. It was released to 352 theaters, with a $2,870 per-theater average. =Reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Tailored for a very specific audience, The Grace Card delivers its noble religious message via implausible plot twists and preachy dialogue.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\" Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times said in a positive review, \\"This is a solid, sincere affirmation of faith and forgiveness.

The structure must be strong enough to withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a deflector, jet blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.Morrison, Rowena. ASRS Directline, Issue Number 6, August 1993. \\"Ground Jet Blast Hazard.\\" Retrieved on November 13, 2009. Jet blast deflectors range in complexity from stationary concrete, metal or fiberglass fences to heavy panels that are raised and lowered by hydraulic arms and actively cooled. Blast deflectors can be used as protection from helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft propwash. At airports and jet engine service centers, jet blast deflectors can be combined with sound-deadening walls to form a ground run-up enclosure within which a jet aircraft engine can safely and more quietly be tested at full thrust. Purpose High energy jet engine exhaust can cause injury and damage. Jet blast has been known to uproot trees, shatter windows, overturn automobiles and trucks, flatten poorly made structures and injure people. Other aircraft in the jet blast, especially lightweight ones, have been blown around and damaged by jet exhaust.

To prevent these problems, jet blast deflectors redirect the air stream in a non-dangerous direction, frequently upward. =Airports= Christmas tree at Glasgow Air Force Base, showing the positioning of the jet blast deflectors Jet blast deflectors began to appear at airports in the 1950s.Brown, Edward L.

Airports often place their deflectors at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have deflectors between taxiways and airport borders. Jet blast deflectors usually direct exhaust gases upward.Campion, Gordon Pearson. Blast deflector. issued October 12, 2004. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the blast fence. Jet blast deflectors have been designed to counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using slotted panel surfaces. Ground run-up enclosure After a jet engine has been overhauled or has undergone the replacement of parts, it is normal to run the engine up to full thrust to test it.Stanley, Lynn B. Blast deflecting fence. , issued September 18, 1984. Rural airports rarely provide more than a distant portion of the airfield within which to test engines at full thrust, but urban airports surrounded by residential areas often specify that engine tests be conducted within a ground run-up enclosure (\\"hush house\\"), so that the engine noise can be reduced for residents. =Aircraft carriers= Sukhoi Su-33 preparing for take-off on Admiral Kuznetsov, on the Barents Sea, using jet blast deflector In 2003 aboard the , a jet blast deflector is raised hydraulically to protect an F/A-18 Hornet from the exhaust of another Aircraft carriers use jet blast deflectors at the rear of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it on the way to the catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.Federation of American Scientists. \\"CV-9 Essex Class: Overview.\\" USS Oriskany (CV-34) began a major refit in October 1947 and was returned to service in August 1951 with a number of modernizations including jet blast deflectors. Jet blast deflectors aboard aircraft carriers are placed in very close proximity to the temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The non- skid decking surface of the deflector suffers heat damage and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel.Fischer, Eugene C. and Dale A. Sowell, John Wehrle, Peter O. Cervenka. Cooled jet blast deflectors for aircraft carrier flight decks. , issued June 10, 2003. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat- dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily‚Äîthe ship carries a large replacement supply. Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.GlobalSecurity.org. \\"CVN-77 - George H.W. Bush.\\" July 10, 2006.

Written in rhyme royal, it is about the conversion of Paul the Apostle. It is part of a collection of mystery plays that was bequeathed to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby in 1634. The Play The action is in three well-defined parts, often, following medieval practice, referred to as \\"stations\\". Each of these stations is introduced and concluded by \\"Poeta\\" (Latin for poet). The first station represents Jerusalem. After the prologue there follows a dance, the direction for which has been added in by a later hand, seemingly in an attempt to make the piece more exciting.Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas edited by Joseph Quincy Adams, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1924 The play proper begins with Saul, dressed in rich apparel, boasting of his power and of the fear which he inspires, doing so \\"a little in the Herod style\\".Ancient Mysteries from the Digby Manuscripts edited by Thomas Sharp, printed for the Abbotsford Club by the Edinburgh Printing Company, 1835 The priests Caypha and Anna give him letters to take to Damascus, where he is to suppress heresy (i.e. the worship of Jesus). Saul then gathers together his knights and servants, who agree to follow him. There follows a comic scene, not present in other versions of the Conversion, between one of Saul's servants and an hostler, who ready a horse which Saul then rides off on. Poeta re-enters to \\"mak a conclusyon\\" of this first station, and again the stage direction \\"daunce\\" has been written in a later hand. In the next station, on the road to Damascus, God, amidst thunder and lightning, visits Saul and rebukes him for persecuting His followers and tells him to enter Damascus. When the visitation is over Saul finds that he is blind and lame. God also visits Ananias, an inhabitant of Damascus, and tells him to go and cure Saul, assuring him that from now on Saul will advance, rather than persecute, Christianity. As Ananias visits Saul the Holy Spirit appears above them, and Saul is healed and baptised. In the third station Saul's knights have returned to Jerusalem, where they tell an angry Caypha and Anna of Paul's conversion to and preaching of Christianity. At this point three leaves have been inserted in a different hand. They make up a comic scene between the demon Belial (whose first line is \\"the usual Satanic exclamation of the mystery writers 'Ho ho'\\") and his messenger, named Mercury. Again, Joseph Quincy Adams believes this has been included to make the play more exciting. The choice of Belial as the chief demon seems to have been influenced by Saul's swearing \\"By the god Bellyall\\" in his first scene. The interpolated text also contains material that could be seen as anti- Semitic and which is not mirrored in the main text ‚Äì Belial claims that he is worshipped \\"In the temples and synogoges\\" and that Caypha and Anna are his \\"prelates\\" and are planning to persecute Saul on his suggestion. Heather Hill- V√°squez, however, interprets Caypha and Anna (in the 16th-century version) as standing for Catholic bishops and their link to Belial as a Protestant Reformation attack on the old religion in a play that is an appropriation of one of its forms of dissemination, the (processional) Saint play.Sacred Players: The Politics of Response in the Middle English Religious Drama by Heather Hill-V√°squez, Catholic University of America Press, 2007 The play proper resumes with Saul (the play does not include his renaming as Paul), now dressed as a disciple of Jesus, delivering to the audience a rather lengthy sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Saul is taken to Caypha and Anna, who order the gates of the city to be locked that they might kill him shortly. However, an angel appears and tells Saul that he will not die yet, and that a place for him in heaven is assured. Saul's escape from the city in a basket is described, not staged. The play ends with Poeta inviting the audience to sing the hymn Exultet caelum laudibus. While Scherb praises the swift ending and finds its reliance on words rather than images appropriate to the play's thematic focus on faith and the movement from iconography to rhetoric, Coldewey simply finds it abrupt. Scholarship The text of The Conversion of Saint Paul is one of five plays (one a fragment) bound together in MS Digby 133, which is preserved in the Bodleian Library, having been bequeathed to it by Sir Kenelm Digby in 1634. Though critics sometimes write of a \\"Digby playwright\\" (particularly when examining the Conversion alongside the Mary Magdalene, the other surviving English Saint play derived from the New Testament), the pieces are in fact independent;Early English Drama: an anthology edited by John C. Coldewey, Routledge, 1993, though the plays' first modern editor, Thomas Sharp, sees in the Conversion \\"a considerable resemblance in general structure and composition to [The Digby Massacre of the Innocents]\\" The plays date from the late fifteenth century and have a transcription date of 1512 on the first page.Medi√¶val Drama by A. M. Kinghorn, Evans Brothers, London 1968The Digby Mysteries edited by F. J. Furnivall, New Shakspere Society/N. Tr√ºbner & Co., 1882 As well as the Conversion and The Digby play of Mary Magdalene there are plays on the Massacre of the Innocents and the resurrection of Jesus, and an incomplete version of the morality play Wisdom entitled Wisdom, Who is Christ. Adams believed the play to have been written by an author from the East Midlands, to be performed at stations in a small village on 25 January, that being the Festival of the Conversion of St. Paul. And while A. M. Kinghorn has it that the play was performed in a fixed locality and was the responsibility, not of the town's guilds, but of the church; Glynne Wickham, citing the text's many apologies for its \\"simpleness\\", argued that the play, in its final form at any rate, belonged \\"to a Guild of artisans who were willing to travel and to adapt their script and presentation to the environment offered by their sponsors and hosts in exchange for hospitality and a small fee\\" and thus, while the Digby plays may have originated, like the so-called Macro plays ‚Äì The Castle of Perseverance, Mankind, and Wisdom ‚Äì, in or near Bury St Edmunds in East Anglia,English Moral Interludes edited by Glynne Wickham, Everyman's Library, 1976 they were able to migrate to Chelmsford in the 16th century.The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre edited by Richard Beadle and Alan J. Fletcher, Cambridge University Press Furnivall could see little in the play that pointed to a specific dialect, other than a few instances that inclined him more to a Midlands dialect than anything else. A later editor, Coldewey, described the dialect as East Anglian, though note that the East Midlands border on East Anglia. Sarah Salih has speculated that The Book of Margery Kempe, written in East Anglia, could have provided inspiration for the Digby plays of conversion, that is the Conversion of Paul and the Mary Magdalene.Gender and Holiness: Men, Women, and Saints in Late Medieval Europe edited by Samantha Riches and Sarah Salih, Routledge, 2002 The interpolations to the original text (the marginal \\"daunce\\" stage directions and the three leaves containing the scene between the devils) seem to come from an early sixteenth-century revival of the piece, and were possibly the work of a man named Myles Blomfylde (whose exact identity is unclear), who may have played the role of Poeta. The play was not much admired by its 19th- and early 20th-century editors: Furnivall wrote that it (and the Digby mysteries as a whole) pointed to \\"the decay of the old religious Drama in England\\" and Manly found it \\"uninteresting\\" and of only historical value.Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama, Vol. 1 edited by John Matthews Manly, Ginn and Company, Boston, 1897 Adams has sympathy with the later author's attempt to introduce more excitement to the piece and goes so far as to omit almost entirely Saul's long sermon on the Seven Deadly Scenes on the grounds of its having \\"no dramatic value\\". For Chester N. Scoville, however, it is just this sermon, rather than Saul's actual conversion, that is at the heart of the play.Saints and the Audience in Middle English Biblical Drama by Chester Norman Scoville, University of Toronto Press, 2004 In this Scoville is typical of late 20th- and 21st-century critics, who have found richness in the play and, in its unclear staging, strategies for interpretation. Staging The play's earliest editors all agreed the original production would have been of the processional sort, with a wagon travelling between three different stations to perform the three scenes of the play, and the audience following, rather as they would performing the Stations of the Cross. The need to accommodate a horse must have meant that the wagon would be fairly large, and with an upper story in order for the Holy Spirit to appear above and from which thunderbolts could be thrown. Lines in Saul's sermon ‚Äì \\"thys semely [assembly] that here syttyth or stonde\\" ‚Äì led scholars to conjecture that a scaffold may have been erected for this and perhaps other stations. It was not until the 1970s that Glynne Wickham, first in an essay and then in his edition of the play, challenged this conception, arguing that the three stations had taken the form either of mobile \\"pageants\\" or fixed \\"mansions\\" grouped together on a single acting area, or \\"platea\\". As William Tydeman points out, much hinges on how one interprets \\"processyon\\" in line 157 ‚Äì as referring to a physical procession, or to the procession of the stage action.The Theatre in the Middle Ages: Western European Stage Conditions, c. 800‚Äì1576 by William Tydeman, Cambridge University Press, 1979 As this line is part of a passage marked \\"si placet\\" (i.e. optional) in the text, Wickham believes it hardly likely to have been a direction to the audience, and that it should be interpreted, along with \\"proces\\" in line 9 and 14, as signifying the thrust of an argument, and not physical movement. In his edition of 1993, Coldewey takes up a revisionist stance, believing that the play was processional in nature and clearly unconvinced by Wickham's argument. Victor I. Scherb, taking the processional staging as read, builds from it an interpretation that sees the play as a theatrical triptych that uses framing devices which serve to draw the audience's focus on the central scene, that of Saul's conversion. This station is framed spatially not only by the procession, but also in terms of \\"high\\" and \\"low\\", thanks to scenes involving God, devils and ostlers. Indeed, the ostler with ideas above his station being seen thrown in dung is taken as a reflection of Saul's own pride, for which he is cast down on the road to Damascus. The purpose of these devices is to provide the audience ‚Äì turned, thanks to the amount of direct address in the play, into a congregation ‚Äì with a spiritual model of the turning away from worldliness. Performances For the 1982 production at Winchester Cathedral the stage direction \\"daunce\\" was interpreted as a means of moving the audience across stations.Staging Faith: East Anglian Drama in the Later Middle Ages by Victor I. Scherb, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001 The Digby Conversion of St. Paul was also performed in 1994 by Poculi Ludique Societas in Toronto.Past productions In November 2000, The Marlowe Project, a production company devoted to early theatre, performed The Conversion of Saint Paul at the Church for All Nations in New York City. The text was modernised and slightly adapted by director Jeff Dailey, who also wrote about the problems performing the play in his article, \\"Saint Paul's Horse and Related Problems\\" in the 2001 edition of Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama.

In 1961, the Atlas was the only rocket in the United States' inventory with sufficient thrust to launch a manned Mercury space capsule into orbit, and Convair was contracted to adapt it for this purpose. After two failed launches of the Atlas carrying an unmanned Mercury capsule, O'Malley was given the task of preparing the Atlas for orbital spaceflight before the end of 1961, because the Soviet Union had already carried out manned orbital missions that year. On September 13, 1961, five months after the last failed launch, the Atlas boosted an unmanned Mercury capsule on an orbital flight. LC-14 On the morning of February 20, 1962, O'Malley was directing the General Dynamics launch team from the windowless blockhouse just a few hundred yards from Pad 14 at Cape Canaveral where John Glenn sat atop the Atlas rocket in Friendship 7. O'Malley methodically worked through the checklist, finally announcing over the intercom, \\"T-minus 18 seconds and counting, engine start\\", as he pressed the black button on his console that began the firing sequence of the Atlas rocket. In response, his boss, astronautics base manager Byron MacNabb, seated in Mercury Control, said, \\"May the wee ones be with you, Thomas\\", a good luck reference to the leprechauns of Irish mythology. O'Malley made the Sign of the Cross, and said, \\"Good Lord ride all the way\\", just before backup astronaut Scott Carpenter, also seated in the blockhouse, made his iconic remark, \\"Godspeed, John Glenn!\\" As the countdown clock reached zero, the Mercury-Atlas rocket lifted off at 9:47 a.m. EST, carrying the first American astronaut into orbit. O'Malley had that black button mounted on a piece of varnished wood as a souvenir, which he continued to proudly display into retirement. On March 4, 1962, O'Malley appeared on the CBS-TV game show, What's My Line?. During the Gemini program, O'Malley remained with General Dynamics working on the Atlas-Agena. O'Malley often went to work at Launch Complex 14 while it was still dark. The road along the launch pads had no street lights so O'Malley complained that it was hard to find the turn to Pad 14 in the dark. A streetlight was installed for him at the entrance to Pad 14, which illuminated continually until his death. It was named \\"O'Malley's Guiding Light\\".Space.com A promotion to senior manager in the Electric Boat division took him away from the space program in 1966. On January 27, 1967, the Apollo 1 command module fire at Launch Complex 34 killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee. North American Aviation built the command module, and had to make organizational changes as well as design modifications as a result of the fatal accident. By May 1967, a new management team was taking shape, and Bastian \\"Buzz\\" Hello, who took over operations at then-Cape Kennedy for North American, hired O'Malley as director of command module launch operations. =Later years= In 1970, O‚ÄôMalley became vice president and general manager of launch operations for North American Rockwell, where he was responsible for Rockwell's work on Skylab and the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project. He subsequently worked on the Space Shuttle program, leading up to its first launch in April 1981, a few months before his retirement. O'Malley died of pneumonia in a Cocoa Beach, Florida hospital on November 6, 2009 at the age of 94.

It is indigenous to the Monti della Tolfa range of hills which lie within the Maremma Laziale, and which give the breed its name. The harsh terrain and limited resources of the area are thought to have contributed to the resistant and frugal nature of the breed. The Tolfetano is one of the fifteen indigenous horse \\"breeds of limited distribution\\" recognised by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. At the end of 2008 it was present in 15 Italian provinces, with a total registered population of 1085. History The horse is thought to represent the original version of the better known \\"Maremmano\\", before the introduction of Thoroughbred blood in the Maremmano breed. According to some the Tolfetano derives from Mongolian horses that found their way into Italy following the hordes of Bulgarian invaders who accompanied the Lombards in their conquest of the northern half of Italy. According to others it originated as a mixture of indigenous horses, barb horses and Spanish horses.

The original breeding herd was dispersed, but was later reconstituted by crossbreeding the horses still available with Purosangue Orientale, Thoroughbred and a new group of stallions freshly imported from Syria. The process was driven by the needs of the Italian Cavalry. After the second world war the breed was reduced to only about 50 heads, most of which were transferred to the Grosseto Army Remount Station.

He served as president of Southwestern University before becoming the first president of Southern Methodist University. Hyer Elementary School in University Park, Texas is named in his honor.  Biography  =Education= Robert Stewart Hyer was born in Oxford, Georgia in 1860. He attended elementary school in Atlanta before receiving a bachelor's and master's degree at Emory College in 1881 and 1882 where he was a Member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He later received honorary degrees from Central Methodist University and Baylor University. =Hyer at Southwestern= Hyer followed fellow Emory graduates Claude C. Cody and Morgan Callaway, Jr. to Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas where he served as a physics professor from 1882 to 1911. In 1894, Hyer built and tested a device that transmitted wireless messages from his laboratory to the city jail. (This early work on the wireless telegraph was contemporaneous with and independent of Guglielmo Marconi's work in Italy and Nikola Tesla's work in New York). He also experimented with X-ray technology and demonstrated it to scientific and medical conferences across Texas in 1896 and 1897. Hyer became university president in 1897 and oversaw a major construction campaign, the university's move to its current location east of Maple Street, increases in the endowment and student population, and the establishment of a fine arts school and medical college. When the Methodist Episcopal Church, South approached Southwestern with a proposal to relocate the university to Dallas, Texas in the early 1910s, Hyer strongly supported relocating the university, even as trustees and faculty grew hostile to the proposal. When Southwestern rejected relocation, Hyer resigned as president in 1911 and moved to Dallas to work toward establishing a new university. =Founding of Southern Methodist= Serving as one of the founders of Southern Methodist University, Hyer set to work planning the campus, selecting the school colors, and directing the architectural design of the university's first building, Dallas Hall. He served as university president from 1911 until 1920 when he was asked to resign amid financial uncertainties. He continued teaching physics at SMU until his death in 1929. Before his death, Hyer applied for a patent for the \\"resistograph\\" he invented to locate oil in West Texas and was elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Emory University in recognition of his scientific achievements.

The official application with which the part is asking from the Greek court authority for recognition in 1916. The Socialist Workers' Federation (, , ), was a socialist organisation in the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Thessaloniki), led by Avraam Benaroya. It was an attempt at union of different nationalities' workers in Salonica within a single labor movement. The Federation in the Ottoman Empire Avraam Benaroya Jewish workers march, 1908 - 1909 Idealistic and pragmatist at the same time, Avraam Benaroya, a Jew from Bulgaria, played a leading role in the creation of the mainly Jewish F√©d√©ration Socialiste Ouvri√®re in Thessaloniki, in May‚ÄìJune 1909.Nar, Alberto: \\"The Jew of Thessaloniki March through Time\\" , in Justice. The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, special issue: Remember Salonika (Spring 1999). ISSN 0793-176X. pp. 9-13. His main associates were militant Sephardic Jews, Alberto Arditti, David Recanati and Joseph Hazan, as well Bulgarians like Angel Tomov and Dimitar Vlahov. The organization took this name because, built on the federative model of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, it was conceived as a federation of separate sections, each representing the four main ethnic groups of the city: Jews, Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks. It initially published its literature in the languages of these four groups (i.e. Ladino, Bulgarian, Greek and Turkish, respectively) but in practice the two latter sections were under-represented if not nonexistent. The publication's title was Journal del Labourador (Ladino) - Amele Gazetesi (Ottoman Turkish). The democratic F√©d√©ration soon became, under Benaroya's leadership, the strongest socialist party in the Ottoman Empire, while the \\"Ottoman Socialist Party\\" was essentially an intellectual club, and the other socialist parties were at the same time national parties, like the Istanbul Greek Socialist Center, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party or the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. It created combative trade unions, attracted important intellectuals and gained a solid base of support among Macedonian workers. By 1910, the F√©d√©ration comprised fourteen syndicates, and in 1912 it mobilized about 12,000 workers in various demonstrations. From 1910 to 1911 Benaroya edited its influential newspaper, the Solidaridad Ovradera, printed in Ladino. F√©d√©ration cultivated strong links with the Second International and had its own representative, Saul Nahum, in the International Socialist Bureau. Unlike other parties which were organised on ethnic lines, as a cross- community group the F√©d√©ration was tolerated by the Ottoman authorities. A prominent Bulgarian member, Dimitar Vlahov, was a socialist MP in the new Ottoman parliament, which was dominated by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) party until 1912. Indeed, its leaders initially supported the Young Turks, and Benaroya participated in the \\"Action Army\\" march on Istanbul to help put down the Countercoup of 1909. Alarmed by the growing power of socialist groups, the CUP subsequently launched a crackdown, during which Benaroya was jailed.Mark Mazower, Salonica city of ghosts, Vintage Books, New York, 2005. pp. 288f. In their reference book over the Balkan Jews, Esther Benbassa and Aron Rodrigues show that the internationalist socialists of the F√©d√©ration defended the Ladino language against the Zionists, favouring Hebrew, and the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, who favoured French, thus remaining in some way close to the traditional Jewish world, they represented a form of westernization without assimilation., L√∂wy Michael, Benbassa (Esther) Rodrigue (Aron) Juifs des Balkans.

The official application with which the party is asking for recognition of the socialist youth in 1915. In the aftermath of the incorporation of Thessaloniki into the Greek state during the Balkan Wars, Benaroya resisted the attempts to impose ethnic divisions in the city. Opposed to the First World War, Benaroya and another Jewish socialist were exiled for two and a half years at the island of Naxos. In contrast to most of the prominent socialists in the pre-1913 Greece who followed Eleftherios Venizelos, Benaroya and the F√©d√©ration, adhering to its internationalist ideals, mobilized for neutrality. As this happened to the same policy as pursued by King Constantine I of Greece and his militaristic entourage (see National Schism), this led to the loss of support for F√©d√©ration in Macedonia. After the departure of its Slavic element, the F√©d√©ration was numerically dominated by Jews.Benbassa, Esther: \\"Le sionisme dans l'Empire ottoman √† l'aube du XXe si√®cle\\", in: XXe Si√®cle., n¬∞24, oct. 1989, p. 74 From 1915 onwards the F√©d√©ration was buoyed by the popular reaction to the war. Both monarchist and Venizelist policy actually assisted the emancipation and the radicalization of the left, and Benaroya, keeping equal distance from both established political groups, was quick to turn the situation to advantage. In the May 1915 general elections the F√©d√©ration sent two deputies representing Thessaloniki to the Greek Parliament, while it lost by only a few votes for a third seat. It already had strong links with internationalist groups and organizations all over Greece and abroad; from them the Socialist Workers' Party was to spring up in due time.Benbassa, Esther, and Rodrigue, Aaron: Historia de los jud√≠os sefard√≠es. De Toledo a Sal√≥nica. Abada, Madrid, 2004 , pp. 308-310. However, another socialist faction, headed by the future Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou, who sided with Venizelos in foreign affairs, also had deputies elected in the same election. Papanastasiou and other reform-minded socialists strongly supported Venizelos' liberal brand of nationalism. Benaroya and the F√©d√©ration, on the other hand, were influenced by Austromarxists such as Victor Adler, Otto Bauer and Karl Renner, who, sensitive to matters national, searched ways to utilize socialism as a cohesive force for the decrepit Habsburg Monarchy; they elaborated the principle of personal autonomy, according to which national consciousness should be depoliticized and become a personal matter. Modern states should be based on free association and allow self-definition and self-organization of ethnicities in cultural affairs, while a mixed parliament, proportionally representing all nations of the realm, should decide on economic and political questions. The F√©d√©ration traced the origins of its federative position in Balkan authors of the Enlightenment like Rigas Velestinlis, and stressed that the forthcoming peace should exclude any change of borders or transfer of populations. The Socialist Labour Party of Greece (later renamed as Communist Party of Greece, KKE), created by Benaroya's initiative near the end of the First World War, followed closely the F√©d√©ration's theses on national self- determination, and wanted to transform the Greek state into a federation of autonomous provinces that would safeguard the rights of minorities and participate in a federative Republic of the Balkan peoples.

Both shows were considered major events in Japan and had involvement from virtually every major wrestling promotion at the time. The first show was held in Yokohama, Japan at the Yokohama Arena on June 30, 1996, with 16,000 in attendance. The show featured interpromotional matches of wrestlers from All Japan Pro Wrestling, Big Japan Pro Wrestling, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, IWA Kakutoshijuku, International Wrestling Association, Japan Pro Shooting, Kitao Dojo, Michinoku Pro, New Japan Pro Wrestling, Professional Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi, Samurai Project, UWFi, Wrestle Association R and joshi promotions GAEA Japan, JWP Joshi Puroresu and Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling. In the main event, Genichiro Tenryu and Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Koki Kitihara and Riki Choshu in a tag team match. On the undercard, Keiji Mutoh & Kensuke Sasaki defeated Shinya Hashimoto & Junji Hirata and a \\"PWFG vs. UWFI\\" match between Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Yoji Anjoh resulted in a double-countout. One of the largest wrestling events of the decade, the first show received some criticism for restricting FMW wrestlers to traditional puroresu as \\"garbage wrestling\\" was prohibited. Of the 15 promotions that participated, a noticeable gap between mainstream and independent promotions was also apparent. A second show was held four years later on March 11, 2000, again held in the Yokohama Arena, and attended by between 13,000 and 9,000 fans. The promotions involved included Battlarts, Big Japan Pro Wrestling, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, Go Gudan, Michinoku Pro, New Japan Pro Wrestling, Pancrase, Takada Dojo, Toryumon, Universal Fighting Arts Organization, WAR and joshi promotions All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling, JWP Project and Neo Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling. Genichiro Tenryu & BB Jones defeated Shinya Hashimoto & Naoya Ogawa in the main event. The undercard matches included Yoji Anjoh defeating Tarzan Goto as well as a tag team match which saw Team Big Japan (Ryuji Yamikawa & Tomoaki Honma) defeat Team FMW (Naoki Yamazaki & H). Also on the card was a celebrity \\"exhibition\\" match which saw Japanese pop star Hideaki Takizawa pin Antonio Inoki. Both the first and second memorial shows were released on VHS in 2000 and on DVD in 2004, the latter as part of a 6-part collection entitled Rikidozan - Puro Founder. A third show was held by Mitsuharu Misawa and Pro Wrestling Noah at Korakuen Hall on December 11, 2003. The event was headlined by Rikidozan's son, Mitsuo Momota, who teamed with Tsuyoshi Kikuchi against KENTA and Naomichi Marufuji for the Global Honoured Champions Tag Team Championship.

The Report of the Committee \\"appointed to investigate safety precautions for Scuba Divers in Fresh Water Sink Holes and Underwater Caves\\" which was presented to the Government in January 1974 essentially recommended non-legislative response to the problem. The subsequent voluntary program of regulation via diver training and certification has been carried out by the Cave Divers Association of Australia. The success of the program is evident with nearly four decades of low fatality cave diving following the implementation of the Report's recommendations.

History For many months, starting in 1883, pressure was placed on the British Government to do something in Bechuanaland because of unrest in the area. On 29 October 1884 the British Government appointed Sir Charles Warren as Special Commissioner of Bechuanaland. On 13 November 1884 Parliament voted a sum of ¬£675,000 (this is equivalent to over ¬£32 million today) for military operations in Bechuanaland. Sir Charles Warren was authorised to recruit an irregular force of 1,500 in South Africa in addition to the regular troops that would be provided. A force of 4,000 troops, under Sir Charles Warren, set off to annex Stellaland and Goshen. On 7 February 1885 the force reached Vryburg, the principal town in Stellaland, then continued to Mafeking, the principal town in Goshen. By 8 April 1885 Sir Charles Warren sent a despatch to notify the British Government that he had occupied Bechuanaland and had entirely restored order. The two Boer republics had collapsed without any bloodshed. On 30 September 1885 Stellaland, Goshen and other territories to the south of the Molopo River were constituted as the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland. Stamps Stellaland stamps, which had been issued in 1884, continued to be used until 2 December 1885.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 1 British Commonwealth Any external mail had to be franked with both Stellaland stamps and Cape of Good Hope stamps. The cancellations on these stamps was by pen and ink. Stellaland stamps are known used by Warren‚Äôs Force at Kimberley. These stamps were withdrawn from use on 2 December 1885.

Eight different values from ¬Ωd to 1s were overprinted by W A Richards & Son of Cape Town. On 1 November 1887 a supply of stamps from Great Britain was issued. The ¬Ωd stamp was a Great Britain stamp overprinted 'BRITISH BECHUANLAND', by De La Rue. Twelve other value ranging in value from 1d to ¬£5 were produced by De La Rue using blank ‚ÄòUnappropriated Die‚Äô designs for British fiscal stamps and overprinting them with 'British Bechuanaland Postage and Revenue'. The stamps produced using the ‚ÄòUnappropriated Die‚Äô designs had values in text. On 7 August 1888 the five low values were overprinted locally in Vryburg, by P Townshend & Co, to show the value in numbers; 1d, 2d, 4d, 6d and 1s. In December 1888 3d stamps of the 1887 issue were overprinted 'One Half-Penny' and in January 1889 Cape of Good Hope ¬Ωd stamps were overprinted 'British Bechuanaland' by the local printer in Vryburg. In 1893 responsibility for the postal services was transferred from the Postmaster-General of British Bechuanaland to the Postmaster-General of the Cape of Good Hope. A further seven stamps were produced by overprinting either Cape Colony stamps or British stamps before British Bechuanaland was annexed by the Cape of Good Hope on 16 November 1895 and ceased to issue stamps.

The film is an adaptation of the 1924 novel of the same name by Edgar Wallace. The film is about a scientist named Dr. Orloff who commits a series of murders for insurance money, while periodically disguising himself as the blind manager of a charity to further his scheme. It was released in November 1939 in Britain, where it became the first British film to receive the \\"H\\" rating meaning \\"Horrific for Public Exhibition\\" (persons aged 16 or above will only be admitted). It was released in the United States in 1940 by Monogram Pictures under the title The Human Monster. Plot In London, Dr. Orloff (Bela Lugosi) runs a life insurance agency where he loans money on his customers' policies. Scotland Yard begins finding bodies in the Thames River, all of them insured by Orloff with the Dearborn Home for the Blind as their sole beneficiary. This charity Home, which Orloff sponsors and serves as its medical advisor, is located in a dilapidated former warehouse abutting the Thames. One of the dead men has a daughter named Diane (Greta Gynt) for whom Orloff obtains employment at the Home as seeing-person secretary to the soft- spoken, also blind, Dearborn. Suspicions begin to arise surrounding Dearborn and Orloff in relation to the dead bodies, and it becomes clear to the audience that Dearborn is really Orloff, disguised as to both face and voice. After Diane finds one of her father's cufflinks at the Home, Orloff sends his henchman Jake (Wilfred Walter), a deformed blind resident of the Home, to kill Diane who has found out too much about them but she eludes him with the help of the young police inspector on the case. Confronted by Diane, Dearborn removes his disguise to show himself as Orloff, carries her to the warehouse's loft where he has been killing his victims by dumping them into a vat of river water charged with electricity, puts her in a straight-jacket and calls for Jake to finish the job of killing her in like manner. Jake refuses as he has found out that Orloff has sadistically deafened his one friend, also blind, before killing him. Jake turns on Orloff, Orloff shoots Jake, but Jake perseveres, captures Orloff and throws him out of a loading door, to sink into the river mud-flats below. The inspector breaks in and frees Diane as Jake dies of his wounds. Cast Production O. B. Clarence dubbed the voice of Professor Dearborn Production began on The Dark Eyes of London in 1938. Actor Bela Lugosi sailed to England to star in the film's dual role of Dr. Orloff and Professor Dearborn (the original novel has two Orloff characters but the film's script combined them into one). When portraying the role of Dearborn, Lugosi's voice is dubbed by O. B. Clarence. It was made at Welwyn Studios with sets designed by the art director Duncan Sutherland. The day after Lugosi arrived on set, shooting began and lasted 11 days.Lennig, 2003. p.270 Production ended on the film in 1939. The final scene involving Orloff's demise was difficult to film.

This form of utility function was first conceptualized by Wassily Leontief.  Examples  Leontief utility functions represent complementary goods. For example: * Suppose x_1 is the number of left shoes and x_2 the number of right shoes. A consumer can only use pairs of shoes. Hence, his utility is \\\\min(x_1,x_2). * In a cloud computing environment, there is a large server that runs many different tasks. Suppose a certain type of a task requires 2 CPUs, 3 gigabytes of memory and 4 gigabytes of disk-space to complete. The utility of the user is equal to the number of completed tasks. Hence, it can be represented by: \\\\min({x_{\\\\mathrm{CPU}}\\\\over 2}, {x_{\\\\mathrm{MEM}}\\\\over 3}, {x_{\\\\mathrm{DISK}}\\\\over 4}).  Properties  A consumer with a Leontief utility function has the following properties: * The preferences are weakly monotone but not strongly monotone: having a larger quantity of a single good does not increase utility, but having a larger quantity of all goods does. * The preferences are weakly convex, but not strictly convex: a mix of two equivalent bundles may be either equivalent to or better than the original bundles. * The indifference curves are L-shaped and their corners are determined by the weights. E.g., for the function \\\\min(x_1/2, x_2/3), the corners of the indifferent curves are at (2t,3t) where t\\\\in[0,\\\\infty). * The consumer's demand is always to get the goods in constant ratios determined by the weights, i.e. the consumer demands a bundle (w_1 t,\\\\ldots,w_m t) where t is determined by the income: t = Income / (p_1 w_1 + \\\\ldots + p_m w_m). Since the Marshallian demand function of every good is increasing in income, all goods are normal goods.  Competitive equilibrium  Since Leontief utilities are not strictly convex, they do not satisfy the requirements of the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu model for existence of a competitive equilibrium. Indeed, a Leontief economy is not guaranteed to have a competitive equilibrium. There are restricted families of Leontief economies that do have a competitive equilibrium. There is a reduction from the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a bimatrix game to the problem of finding a competitive equilibrium in a Leontief economy. This has several implications: * It is NP- hard to say whether a particular family of Leontief exchange economies, that is guaranteed to have at least one equilibrium, has more than one equilibrium. * It is NP-hard to decide whether a Leontief economy has an equilibrium. Moreover, the Leontief market exchange problem does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, unless PPAD ‚äÜ P. On the other hand, there are algorithms for finding an approximate equilibrium for some special Leontief economies.

He is worshipped in this name at South India in an ancient temple. This ancient shiva temple dates back to 6600 years approximately. The exact age of the temple cannot be determined. The temple is located in South India in a small village called Thiruthalayur. The village located en route of Pulivalam to Musri is in Thurayur taluk of Tiruchy district in Tamil Nadu. History states the temple was erected by emperor PURAR approximately 6600 years back. The intention of erecting the temple was to ward of the Brahmahati Dosha, the emperor had. The temple is located in the river bed of Ayyaru, but the river has vanished long back and the lands around are cultivated lands now. There are 2 shivalingas in the temple. The Shivalinga in the main altar was worshiped by the saptha rishis. The other liga was erected by King Ravana and worshiped by him on the way from Kailash back to Lanka after obtaining a boon from lord Shiva for 35 million years of life. King Ravana on his way back from Kailash saw this temple from his Viman and came down and made a linga and started worshipping it. The seven saints, Saptha Rishis on seeing Ravana hid in a tree behind the temple. A tree present behind the temple called Marutha Maram in native language exists. There are multiple knots on the tree and 7 prominent ones which are believed to be the rishis in the tree. Since Ravana had 35 million years to live, Lord Vishnu wanted it to be shortened. So he assumed the form of an old brahman at a place called Kathri Medu approximately 1 km from Thiruthlayaur to tackle Ravana. As Ravana was passing by he saw the old man watering a Thulasi plant in pot with a pitcher with holes in it. King Ravana addressed the old man and the old man being pleased blessed him and told him to request more years of life from Lord Shiva. King Ravana took to the suggestion and started severe prayers to Lord Shiva. Ravana started cutting his ow head one by one as he had 10 heads. When he was about to cut his 10th and last head, pleased with his worship Lord Shiva appeared in front of him and granted a boon. Ravana asked for 5 million years of life. The Lord granted him and vanished. Then Ravana realised he was tricked as he failed to mention that this 5 million years was to be in addition to the 35 million years he already had. But it was late and his life span was reduced from 35 million years to 5 million years. Other interesting facts about the temple are a Ruthra Pasupathi Nayanar, one of the 64 Nayanmars, lived here and worshiped Lord Shiva. Also it i noted that for a period of 6 months the light from the sun in the morning falls on the feet or the base of the Shiva Linga for about 15 minutes during the day. A pond that adorns the front of the temple has water in it based on the monsoon that year. The pond had intricate canals constructed which lead water to the base of the shiva linga. But over the years the canal seems to have given way and water does not flow down to the linga as described in literature. Also noted according to folklore is the pond does not have any frogs in it. It is said Mandothari who was Ravana's wife assumed the form of a frog and guarded the temple when Ravana was in prayer and did not let anyone into the temple. There is not much history about Kungumabal. Such a great temple now stands in almost desolate ruins. It needs to be revived by proper construction.

It was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, and directed by B. J. Novak, marking his directorial debut on the network series. It aired in the United States on NBC on December 3, 2009. Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg submitted this episode for the 2010 Emmys. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, it is revealed that ten years ago, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) heedlessly promised to pay for the college tuition of an entire local third grade class. Now, lacking the personal wealth necessary to fulfill his promise, he and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) must go tell the students, who are now high school seniors, that they will not be receiving the money. Meanwhile, in Michael's absence, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to start an employee-of-the-month program with the intention of getting Jim into trouble. The episode received critical acclaim, with many recognizing it as a classic Office episode. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) realizes he cannot keep a promise he made to a group of underprivileged children ten years ago: that he would pay for their college tuition provided they graduated from high school. He reluctantly visits their high school with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to break the bad news. Michael's promise encouraged the students to excel academically, and they greet Michael with standing applause. When Michael addresses them, he congratulates everyone for being able to graduate from high school, before admitting that he does not have the money to pay for college. Everyone is upset, and Michael fruitlessly attempts to calm them by offering them laptop batteries. One of the students follows Michael outside to tell him what he did was ‚Äúmessed up,‚Äù and Michael offers to at least pay for his books if he attends college. In the car on the way back to the office, Michael continues to lament his promise, but Erin comforts him by pointing out that this group of students have a much higher graduation rate, and that, at the very least, will help them significantly. Michael then warms up to Erin, telling her she is doing a good job and asking about her future plans. He then relates to her that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) was originally going to be hired to work in the warehouse, but Michael saw \\"something\\" in him and made him their new accountant instead; the two drive on singing happily. Meanwhile, on a suggestion from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) starts an employee of the month program to increase office morale. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, schemes to get Jim fired. He gives Jim a performance sheet to determine the employee of the month, using complete anonymity to ensure a fair and unbiased assessment. Dwight also collects money from each of the employees as part of a cash prize, even though Jim did not authorize this. At the conclusion of the day, Jim announces the employee of the month, and it is revealed that he apparently picked himself by accident. Everyone starts blaming Jim for using this gimmick as a ploy to take money away from the office. Jim tries to pin part of the failure on Dwight, but since he has taken numerous precautions to protect himself from direct blame, he passively fires back. Jim decides to forgo the award and give it to the next best employee, but things are only made worse when that person is revealed to be his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer). Everyone reaches their breaking point when a cake is delivered to the office with Jim's face on it, and with the words \\"It Could Only Be You.\\" With the primary part of his plan a success, having manipulated the assessment and ordered the cake, Dwight initiates the second part of his plan by calling CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) multiple times, each time pretending to be a different employee complaining about Jim's failed program. An angry David calls Jim back and chews him out for the mishap. Almost assured that this will get Jim fired, Dwight listens in to the phone conversation from the pen recorder he had left in Jim's office in a previous episode (\\"The Lover\\"). But instead of firing Jim, David apologizes to him for losing his temper and praises Jim, adding that David and his wife are \\"still on\\" to go out with Jim and Pam. Angry that his plan has not worked, Dwight returns to the drawing board. At the end of the episode, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) confronts Dwight with Dwight's \\"Diabolical Plan\\" document he found, but expresses his desire to also get Jim fired. The two form an alliance. Reception \\"Scott's Tots\\" first aired on NBC on December 3, 2009. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an estimated 8.055 million viewers and received a 4.1 rating/11 percent share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 4.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In addition, the episode ranked first in its half-hour timeslot and was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode a 9.4 out of 10 rating, denoting an \\"amazing\\" episode. It was also the highest score given to any sixth-season episode by the site. Phillips called the episode \\"an instant classic and another phenomenal installment of this season, which hit some rough patches but seems to have recovered brilliantly\\", especially pointing out the scene between Michael and the irate students. Phillips felt that the main scene between Michael and the children was pivotal and that it \\"might just rank atop The Offices long list and rich history of uncomfortable yet hilarious moments\\".Phillips, Dan (December 4, 2009). \\"The Office: \\"Scott's Tots\\" Review ‚Äì Michael Scott Crushes the Dreams of Under-Privileged Teens\\".

[...] The pain on Michael's face was palpable. I had the same expression.\\" He, however, was more critical of the episode's subplot, noting that he was \\"getting tired of Dwight's diabolical plans\\". He felt that Jim should have caught onto Dwight's plan, rather than fall for it. Keller ultimately concluded that the episode was \\"a solid job this week.

Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the episode \\"kick-ass\\" and awarded it an \\"A‚àí\\". Rabin commended the fact that Michael's bad-idea-for-the-right- reason made him likable. Furthermore, he noted that both Michael and the kids engaged in \\"mutually beneficial self-deception\\"; the former thought he could save those in need, and the latter had something to look forward to. Rabin also enjoyed the subplot involving Jim and Dwight, noting that it \\"afforded [actor Rainn Wilson] an opportunity to do surprisingly accurate, unconscionably mean impersonations of Stanley and Toby\\". Several critics, on the other hand, felt that the main plot was too mean to be humorous. Gage Henry of Paste felt that the episode was weak because \\"one [of its storylines was] rather flimsy and the other ending up too atrocious to watch.\\" He noted that the formula of \\"Jim tries to conduct one normal day at the office while Michael is out making an ass of himself somewhere\\" was \\"becoming bland\\". Ultimately, however, he could not decide if the episode \\"was commendably funny, or if it was as humorous as a child realizing that Santa Claus doesn‚Äôt exist.\\" Henry graded the episode a 6 out of 10.Henry, Gage (December 4, 2009). \\"The Office Review: 'Scott's Tots' (Episode 6.12).

Directed by David DeCoteau, the film was also released under the titles I Was a Teenage Sex Maniac and I Was a Teenage Sex Mutant. The alternative titles explain the movie's plot. The film's plot centers on an unpopular honors student named Wesley Littlejohn (Billy Jacoby), who becomes involved in an experiment headed by his new, sexy biology teacher, Ms. Xenobia (Judy Landers). As part of the experiment, Wesley becomes a chick magnet whenever a phallic stalk emerges from his head. However, this threatens to alienate the girl he really cares about, Leanne (Oliva Barash), and Wesley begins to suspect Xenobia's motives, which may have something to do with the fact that she isn't from Earth. Plot Dr. Ackerman (Troy Donahue) is the high school biology teacher. Leaving school one night he crashes his car after encountering a UFO. Wesley Littlejohn is a nerd who is in Dr. Ackerman's class, along with his opportunistic friend Marvin (Stuart Fratkin). Wesley is the stereotypical nerd who is bullied at school and relies on Marvin to defuse situations with the bullies. He is also in love with a girl named Leanne, but is too shy to make any kind of approach to her. Instead of Dr. Ackerman teaching biology that day, a sexy, blond substitute teacher named Ms. Xenobia arrives and informs the class she will be teaching for the time being. All the boys in the class are stunned at having such a sexy woman as a teacher, apart from Wesley. Looking for a participant in an experiment, all the boys in class volunteer but Ms. Xenobia selects Wesley and asks him to attend after school has finished. Wesley goes back to the class after school, where he encounters Drax, Ms. Xenobia's assistant (Raymond O'Connor). Ms. Xenobia arrives and explains that the experiment involves being injected with a vitamin supplement and observing Wesley's reaction. Wesley does not want to participate and Ms. Xenobia agrees, before injecting him with the \\"supplement\\" when his back is turned. A phallic stalk starts to emerge from Wesley's head as a result. Becoming sexually excited by the sight of the stalk, Ms. Xenobia proceeds to remove her lab coat, revealing white lingerie underneath. She then has sex with Wesley (who is oblivious to his surroundings) with Drax recording the findings. After the \\"experiment\\" Wesley is sent home. At home Wesley's parents and brother start to see changes in him; he becomes more confident and assured, which allows him to get closer to Leeane. After the experiment, however, there is a tendency for the stalk to emerge at the most inconvenient times, usually when there are women around. This leads to several sexual encounters with them, notably with a former bully's girlfriend and the gym teacher Miss Buckmeister (Edy Williams). Each time these encounters happen, Wesley is left with amnesia, and he starts to suspect Ms. Xenobia has given him something more than a vitamin supplement. Challenging Ms. Xenobia on the experiments, he is injected again with the serum by Drax and again has sex with Ms. Xenobia. Away from school, Wesley becomes the singer of a heavy metal band called the Sex Mutants (prior to this, he played classical piano). He also goes on a date with Leanne, although it is interrupted by the stalk which leads Leanne to become passionate with him before \\"waking up\\" and accusing Wesley of trying to take things too fast. Wesley protests his innocence later on and invites her to a gig that the Sex Mutants are playing. The Sex Mutants play their gig, along with support from the Poon Tangs (an all-girl group featuring Ginger Lynn Allen, Linnea Quigley & Laura Albert). After the show has finished, Wesley is backstage with the Poon Tangs when Leanne arrives. Shocked that Wesley appears to be flirting with the girls, she runs off and Wesley follows her. Outside the venue, Wesley encounters Ms. Xenobia, who is wearing a silver spacesuit. Ms. Xenobia informs Wesley that she and Drax are aliens from the planet Alterion who had been experimenting on him to help their race, as the males of their species lost the ability to procreate and Ms. Xenobia was tasked with finding a cure. With humans having a similar biology to her species, she and Drax landed on Earth (inadvertently causing the demise of Dr. Ackerman) and began their experiments with Wesley. When a skeptical Wesley does not believe this, Ms. Xenobia then proceeds to peel off her face, revealing that she is a blue-skinned alien with a large head rather than a sexy woman. This causes Wesley to panic, throw Ms. Xenobia into a garbage can, and flee. Wesley returns to the school (encountering Drax) where he blows up the biology lab, destroying Ms. Xenobia's serum. Meanwhile, Ms. Xenobia starts to shoot up the music venue with a ray gun. Wesley arrives with the last batch of serum and threatens to drop it unless Ms. Xenobia stops her violent spree. When Ms. Xenobia refuses, Wesley destroys the serum, shocking her enough that she stops shooting. Despondent that the chances of saving her race are over, Drax appears with a stalk growing from his head; he had taken some of the serum because he was in love with Ms. Xenobia. This allows Ms. Xenobia to have a change of heart and she apologizes for all the hassle she caused Wesley. The film ends as Ms. Xenobia and Drax head home to their planet, while Wesley continues his new career with the Sex Mutants and his relationship with Leeane.

Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) comes into the office as Santa and is outraged that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had already allowed Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to be Santa at the office Christmas party this year. Everyone seems to enjoy having Phyllis as Santa, but Michael continues to try to steal her thunder, prompting Jim to tell him to cease and desist. Michael then rearranges his costume into a Jesus outfit and starts heckling and interrupting Phyllis while she's giving out the Secret Santa gifts. When Jim stops Michael again, Michael calls CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to complain. David asks not to be bothered as someone made an agreement to buy the company, and David and presumably everyone else will lose their jobs after the fact. Michael calls a conference meeting to try to keep up everyone's spirits but reveals that the company is going out of business, which puts everyone into shock. When Jim asks for confirmation, Michael says that David told him that the company is being sold. Jim notes that being sold could be different than going out of business, so Michael calls back David with everyone listening. David explains that he meant that only he, CEO Alan Brand, and a few other executives at corporate will lose their jobs, but the branches will stay as they are the only successful aspect of the company. The office then cheers and goes back to the party, where everyone receives their Secret Santa gifts and Michael apologizes to Phyllis for trying to overshadow her. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) has a secret crush on Matt (Sam Daly), one of the new warehouse workers. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) tries to play matchmaker and introduces Matt to Oscar. After conversing a while, Matt leaves and Oscar asks Pam to let him pursue Matt by himself. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) explains that his present has been delivered to him in pieces over the course of several weeks. After his first attempt to assemble it, he believes it is a gun. However, after a hint from Michael, he rebuilds it and realizes it is in fact a nutcracker. He is pleased, exclaiming \\"Oh man! I can use this for so many nuts!\\" Additionally, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) had asked to have Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) as his recipient for Secret Santa and decides to give her the Twelve Days of Christmas as his gift to her. However, the gifts, most of which are actual live birds, are causing her physical harm, prompting her to publicly ask her Secret Santa to discontinue. Andy asks Phyllis not to reveal him as Erin's Secret Santa, but Michael reveals that Andy had Erin for Secret Santa and she becomes upset with Andy. At the end of the episode, as the office leaves for the night, they are greeted by the \\"twelve drummers\\" in the parking lot. Andy joins them and wishes Erin a Merry Christmas, completing his Secret Santa gift to her. They start drumming and Erin is visibly pleased by the gesture.

The episode sees stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb going to an Egyptian-themed theater where they become inspired to befriend a mummy they believe is being kept in the theater basement. They confuse the mummy for their sister Candace, who was accidentally wrapped up in toilet paper. Meanwhile, Dr. Doofenshmirtz tries to blow up a beaver dam in order to make his property beachfront. \\"Are You My Mummy?\\" was written by series co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, along with Bobby Gaylor and Martin Olson, and directed by Povenmire. It originally aired on Disney Channel in the United States on February 15, 2008, as part of the month-long marathon event \\"Phineas and Ferb-urary.\\" Critical reception for the episode was generally favorable. The featured song, \\"My Undead Mummy and Me,\\" was also well received and became available on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack in 2009. Plot summary Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, along with their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who discover an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired to find their own mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her. Meanwhile, Perry, the boys' pet platypus who leads a double life as a secret agent, goes off to a lake near a beaver dam which his nemesis Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz plans on destroying. Once Perry arrives, Doofenshmirtz traps him an indestructible bubble made of \\"pure evil\\" and space age polymers and explains that he hopes to disassemble the dam using the Woodenator (described as operating like a magnet, except that it attracts wood), in order to raise water levels, making his estate beachfront property. Perry eventually destroys the bubble and begins to fight Doofenshmirtz, until the dam is destroyed and they are sent with the water as it washes into the pipe system. Doofenshmirtz, Perry, and the lake water reach the pipe lines next to the theater's basement where the boys and Candace are. Perry defeats Doofenshmirtz without catching the attention of the three and the water washes away Candace's toilet paper. When they get outside to meet up with their father, Phineas is dumbfounded as to where their mummy went, but Lawrence thinks he is simply referring to their mother and they get into the car. As they ride off, Ferb explains the process of mummification and Candace says that only the \\"lucky [mummies]\\" get the full process. Production alt=A Caucasian male sits at a desk, wearing a black shirt with a microphones in front of him. \\"Are You My Mummy?\\" was written by Phineas and Ferb co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, along with Bobby Gaylor and Martin Olson. It was storyboarded by artists Kyle Baker and Mike Roth, and directed by Povenmire. It was originally broadcast in the United States on Disney Channel on February 15, 2008 as part of the special month-long marathon event \\"Phineas and Ferb-urary.\\" Plot elements for the episode date back to the original pitch to The Walt Disney Company for the series produced by Povenmire and Marsh. The pitch was constructed of storyboard reels which were recorded and dubbed over by Povenmire for voices, narration, and sound effects. The initial theme song featured an illustration of Phineas and Ferb, wearing their archeologist hats, discovering Candace, dressed in raggy toilet paper. \\"Are You My Mummy\\" is available on the 2008 DVD compilation Phineas and Ferb: The Fast and the Phineas, along with fellow first season episodes of the series \\"One Good Scare Ought to Do It!\\" \\"The Fast and the Phineas,\\" \\"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror,\\" \\"Flop Starz,\\" \\"Raging Bully,\\" \\"Lights!

Reception \\"Are You My Mummy?\\" received generally favorable reviews from television critics. Reviewers particularly praised the musical number \\"My Undead Mummy and Me.\\" DVD Verdict reviewer Jim Thomas called it \\"truly twisted\\" in his review of The Fast and Phineas.

Their debut album titled \\"Afloat\\" was released in January 2009. Both graduated from the University of Oregon's Lundquist College of Business before pursuing a music career together. Both played American football and were track and field athletes at the University of Oregon prior to focusing on music.  Personal  Caleb and Sol Rexius were born January 18, 1985 to Alan and Jenny Rexius. Sol was born 15 minutes prior to Caleb, and they weighed 8 lbs. 1 oz., and 8 lbs. respectively. Other than their mother playing the piano for church on Sundays, music was never a part of their upbringing. At a young age, they began to excel in athletics, and focused on Football and Track and Field. Competing in National Junior Olympics competitions, they both achieved all-American status in their respective events, and then transferred that speed to the football field during the fall time. In high school, they were league MVP's and combined for over 2,500 yards and 40 touchdowns in their senior year. In track and field, Sol was a state champion in both the 110 meter hurdles and the 300 intermediate hurdles. Caleb was all-state in all 4 of his events, 100m, 200m, Long Jump, and the 4x100 meter relay. They were then both invited to play football and run track for the University of Oregon. In their freshman redshirt year, together they were awarded scout team player of the week a total of 8 times throughout the 2003 season. During winter training, Caleb was awarded the ironman award calculated by strength to bodyweight ratios. In the spring of 2004, they decided to walk away from football and focus on Track and Field for the 2005 season before ending their athletic careers. Caleb was married in August 2006 to Elizabeth Gerot, long-time friend since high school. Before pursuing a music career, Caleb and Betsie worked for Young Life at the Washington Family Ranch (formally known as Wildhorse Canyon) Sol was married in 2010 and has 3 children. Caleb has one child. Sol started the UFC Good Fight Ministry for college students on the University of Oregon Campus. History After walking away from collegiate athletics at age 20, they jointly decided to pursue music. Caleb was accepted on to the University of Oregon's a cappella group \\"On the Rocks\\", while Sol sung with the University's highly esteemed Gospel Choir led by Cedric Weary. With the exception of occasional singing duet requests, Caleb and Sol did not perform consistently until 2009. =Composition= Caleb met Scott and Marisa Frantz while attending Calvary Fellowship Church in Eugene. After playing on the worship team for nearly a year together, Caleb approached Scott about recording an album in Scott's converted garage studio. After hearing some rough cuts of their songs, he agreed to take on the project. Throughout the 3-month recording process, Scott naturally became a part of the band and collaborated with Caleb and Sol in shaping the 14 tracks on their debut album, in addition to recording his own electric guitar parts. Scott's wife, Marisa, also contributed to the album with violin. Hunter Gray, the drummer, was a long-time friend of Sol's and former student in the Youth Group where Sol led at First Baptist Church in Eugene. The 5-member band was officially composed in January 2009. On occasion, Dennis Hvass, who is a lifelong friend of both Caleb and Sol, will play harmonica at live shows. Dennis also completes the third harmony when they perform the national anthem at events like the NCAA Championships, USA Track and Field National Championships, University of Oregon athletic events, and OSAA state championships. Mike Heater occasionally plays the cajon for added percussion, typically at Caleb and Sol's acoustic shows.

He persevered in the face of persecution for the sake of the correct teaching, and finally attained Buddhahood. Bodhisattva Never Disparaging was Shakyamuni Buddha in one of his past lifetimes. Etymology The name of SadƒÅparibh≈´ta is thought to mean never despising (Skt. sadƒÅ-aparibh≈´ta: always, not despising). However it can also be translated as sadƒÅ-paribh≈´ta: always despised. According to Hurvitz, \\"It is possible that the name is a false sankritization of a Prakrit form going back to sadƒÅparibhavitƒÅ, nom. s. of sadƒÅparibhavitr, hence ever disgracing or never disgracing, of which, of course, the former is not possible.\\" Anesaki attributes this more popular choice of translation to KumƒÅrajƒ´va. The story of SadƒÅparibh≈´ta In chapter 20 of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha explains that those who despise or abuse the followers of the Lotus Sutra's teaching, will have to face negative karmic consequences. People who preserve the Lotus teaching will however be able to purify their faculty of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. In order to explain this again, the Buddha tells a story about a previous life (avadana) when he was a Bodhisattva called SadƒÅparibh≈´ta. SadƒÅparibh≈´ta did not study or explain sutras but he paid homage to all Buddhist monks, nuns or lay followers he met and predicted that they all would become Buddhas. Some Buddhists questioned SadƒÅparibh≈´ta's authority to make such a prediction of future Buddhahood and got angry. When they attacked him with sticks or stones he shouted from a distance, \\"I do not despise you. You are not despised, for you all perform bodhisattva practice and you are to become buddhas.\\" Before he died he heard the Lotus Sutra and was able to purify the six senses. After an inconceivable number of rebirths he had accumulated great merit and attained the perfect enlightenment of a Buddha.

It was the first release in a planned multimedia franchise to be marketed to the American youth demographic. After reaching 2 million \\"splatters\\" the game was shut down, but later had a release on iOS devices .http://pc.ign.com/articles/101/1010231p1.html  Gameplay  The game is played with 2-4 players, where a player uses their Nanovor teams (called Swarms) to battle the other swarms by using three attacks (Or in rare cases, four) unique to each Nanovor to deal damage and lower values. Each Nanovor has 4 value types: power (how much damage an attack does), armor (the amount of damage reduced), speed (decider on who attacks first) and health (the life gauge) plus the attacks require energy to play, where energy is increased by 2 after each round. You can also swap in other Nanovor to fit your strategy. Players can also use various hacks and mods to change up the game in various ways like swap-blocking an opponent and using things called spikes to upgrade an attack. When a Nanovor gets down to health level 0, it gets \\"splattered\\" and thus, is removed from the game. The first one to splatter all the opposing swarms wins. = Power mechanics = The amount of damage of an attack is based on the power of the attacking nanovor and how the actual attack changes the amount of damage done. For example, a nanovor with 100 strength and uses an attack that has damage equal to half its strength will do 50 damage. The damage is always rounded to the nearest whole number. = Armor Mechanics = The armor stat on a nanovor affects how much damage is taken off attacks that hit it. It takes off as much damage as a total of how much armor it currently has. For example, a nanovor with 5 armor will only take 45 damage from a normally 50 damage attack. = Speed Mechanics = The nanovor that goes first in a battle is determined based on every nanovor in the battle's speed. It works like a raffle. For example, in a battle between a 50 speed nanovor and a 20 speed nanovor, the first will have 50/70 chances of going first, and the second 20/70 chances of going first.  Story  The nanovor thrived and fought for dominance and glory during the formation of earth. When the Earth formed its oxygen-based atmosphere the nanovor became extinct, turning them into grains of sand, pieces of crystal and the element silicon. In 1961, when the first silicon chip was activated, a Nanovor was inside it, thus reactivating the species. It wasn't until the present that humanity became known through high school student Lucas Nelson who built a mini equivalent of an electron microscope (which he called a Nanoscope) to try to study dust mites but found the nanovor instead. Now he, his science teacher Mr.Sapphire (nicknamed Doc Zap) and Lucas' friends Drew, Monty and Nathan, along with other kids, formed the Lab Rats, a special group designed to study the Nanovor in greater detail by playing the game. Lucas also has a Nanovor Sensei named Taslos to learn more about the history of the Nanovor. However they had to keep the discovery a secret. One day, a group of students found out about the Nanovor and so these kids ( a bully named Ben, his friend Sam Bramage(aka Bulk Damage), Dana Diamondback of the cheerleading squad and her father Richard, who wants revenge on the company S.K.Y. Labs) formed the Snake Pit, an evil force to try to prove they are the better players. The full story can be viewed on the website through videos which are being constantly updated every Friday.  Game-related information  As of December 13, 2010, the online game was scheduled to be discontinued on Dec. 31, 2010. The game can be played in 3 formats: on the computer and through the single-player and multi-player games on the Nanoscope game attachment (looking like the one used by the Lab Rats in the series). The program needed to play the game can be downloaded from the site or a DVD-Rom disk found in various items. When you open the game you can get a battle going or you can manage your Nanovor and profile through various ways:make it = Collection tab = You can view your collection of Nanovor through here. Each Nanovor is divided into 3 family types: Magnamods(Red) who have high armor always, Velocitrons(Yellow) who have lots of Hacks and Mods and Hexites(Blue) which have attacks that ignore armor. Each Nanovor also gets a swarm value to rate how powerful it is (when making a swarm you can only have up to 1000 points worth of value). If you have a Nanoscope, you can also increase how powerful a Nanovor is by playing minigames to earn Jolts which add to any values except swarm values. You can even see the badges the Nanovor has.  = Profile tab = You can see your statistics and badges plus change your avatar. The Badges show accomplishments you have done. Some badges give you rewards while others are needed to change specific Nanovor. Some are needed to evolve some nanovor. = Get Nanovor tab = This page can let you purchase Booster packs to get new Nanovor and EMs. Getting these packs require Nanocash that you can get from the site or from Game cards at specific retailers. More Booster packs will be coming soon. There will be a pack at the top of the list.

Design Roberto Longhi, one of the most prominent Reggiane aircraft designers, in a letter to the Italian aviation magazine JP4, dated May 1976, stated that Regia Aeronautica Major Antonio Ferri asked him to study an engine option for the Reggiane Re.2005. The requirement was to install a supplemental Fiat A.20 engine behind the cockpit, driving a compressor, in order to improve the Daimler-Benz DB 605 main engine output, giving the airplane a speed of above . It was also planned to use a tail exhaust to achieve more thrust, effectively creating a Motorjet The proposal was filed as \\"Re.2005 R\\" by Regia Aeronautica Stato Maggiore (HQ), but remained only a paper project, as, according to Longhi, the aircraft would have had problems with its center of gravity. One possible alternative method of propulsion to the motorjet to was to obtain turbojet engines from Germany, but despite requests from Antonio Alessio and Count Giovanni Battista Caproni, the Germans delivered only a wooden mock-up for dimensional tests to Reggiane. After the war, Longhi tried to conduct experiments with two Junkers Jumo 004 engines that were left in Udine airport after the German defeat. These extremely valuable jet engines were delivered to Italy in 1945 as spare parts for a Luftwaffe high speed reconnaissance flight, equipped with three Arado Ar 234 Blitz, when the nearly impossible to intercept German twin-jet planes participated to the Italian Campaign. Unfortunately for Reggiane's designers, the engines were purchased by Angelo Ambrosini, another Italian aircraft manufacturer. Some Re.2007 drawings were made after the war by airplane designer Pellizzola. These drawings were speculative reconstructions derived from a Reggiane engineer's description. The drawings portrayed the aircraft as an advanced jet fighter, complete with futuristic (for 1943) swept wings, which only became common on fighter planes in the 1950s, although the Germans had used them on both the Me262 jet and Me163 rocket fighters. Rumours about a partially built airframe with technical sketches, both sent to the United Kingdom and the United States for studies, were published in some Italian books and magazines, but are now considered highly improbable. Most modern scholars now consider the Re.2007 to not have been a real design; instead being merely a \\"phantom\\" of sorts, cobbled together from various projects by faulty recollection.

Its principal corporate offices are located in Reno, Nevada and has operations throughout the Americas. It merged with Dayton Mining Corporation in 2002. In 2013, Pacific Rim became a wholly owned subsidiary of OceanaGold. Projects As the company's projects were still in development, Pacific Rim had no income in 2009. At the end of 2009, the company's total assets were valued at $8.2 million.Pacific Rim Mining Corp. 2009 Annual Report El Dorado mine in El Salvador The proposed El Dorado mine project is Pacific Rim's largest project. The company gained the mine property, of 144 square kilometres, from its merger with Dayton Mining Corporation in 2002, and claims to have invested approximately $77 million to discover and prepare to begin mining gold deposits in Caba√±as department. The company estimates that it can extract 1.4 million gold-equivalent troy ounces. =Controversy= According to US think tank Public Citizen Pacific Rim did not complete a feasibility study required for a mining permit, and in July 2008 ceased exploratory drilling. Expatriate Salvadorans and local activists connected with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) political party campaigned for the project to be discontinued over human rights issues, and concerns of pollution arising from the extraction of gold and silver. As of December 2008, 24 mining projects were waiting for new mining laws introduced by the National Coalition Party (PCN) to be finalized. However, environmentalists warned of negative environmental and social impacts if mining went ahead. On June 16, 2009, FMLN lawmakers demanded a permanent ban on gold and silver mining in El Salvador, whose requirements meant that \\"companies involved in mining activities in El Salvador would have 180 days to abort operations and leave the country.\\" However, the proposal did not become law. Pacific Rim claimed that the mine would be environmentally responsible, provide jobs and spur economic development. The company also claimed that dewatering activities in the mine would produce substantial amounts of water, and that it would collect runoff rain water.[Pacific Rim Social and Environmental Responsibility] However, some organizations and the Salvadorian government questioned these claims. In 2008, tensions in Caba√±as rose as three prominent anti-mining activists were murdered. In June 2009‚Äîafter the murder of a local pro-mining businessman, Horacio Menjivar, two months earlier‚Äîenvironmental campaigner Marcelo Rivera Moreno was kidnapped, tortured and murdered. In August, Menjivar's son, Oscar, was arrested for the attempted murder of another anti-mining activist, Ramiro Rivera Gomez (no relation to Marcelo Rivera Moreno). In October, Esperanza Menjivar, the widow of Horacio and mother of Oscar, was murdered. On December 20, 2009, Ramiro Rivera Gomez was murdered, followed by another anti-mining activist, Dora Alicia Recinos Sorto, on December 26. Recinos Sorto was eight months pregnant when she was shot dead, and her two-year-old son was also wounded in the attack. While some anti-mining activists suggested the murders were connected to Pacific Rim, local police and other investigators believed that they were connected to a series of murders (six in total) between two neighborhood groups. In June 2010, Pacific Rim CEO Thomas Shrake testified before the Canadian parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, stating that suggestions that the company had been involved in the murder of anti- mining activists were \\"simply outrageous\\" and that they would be \\"contrary to everything we believe and practice.\\" He also noted that the mine operation and employees had been victims of attacks, including \\"mobs\\" that damaged their property and hacked down trees planted as part of the company's reforestation program. =International arbitration= In response to President Antonio Saca's refusal to allow a mining permit, Pacific Rim Mining Corp. invoked a provision of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in 2009 to place the matter in the hands of an international arbitration court. As Canada is not a party to CAFTA, the company declared ad hoc a subsidiary in Nevada as the base for the claim. The company sought over $300 million in damages, asserting that the government \\"changed the rules of the game\\" laid out in the nation's mining laws. The administration of Saca's successor Mauricio Funes later said in 2009 that it would be willing to negotiate with Pacific Rim concerning its arbitration claims, while Funes' chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, \\"acknowledged that the merits of the Pacific Rim case were strong.\\" When Pacific Rim invoked the CAFTA international arbitration provision in 2009, initially seeking $77 million in damages, the Salvadoran government called the action \\"an attack\\" on its national sovereignty.Randal C. Archibold, \\"First a Gold Rush, Then the Lawyers,\\" New York Times, 25 June 2011 . Other gold mining companies with operations in Central America, such as Goldcorp, said they may use the Pacific Rim case to adjudicate disputes of their own.James Fredrick, \\"CAFTA Weakens Central America's Hand In Mining Conflicts,\\" World Politics Review, 7 May 2012 . In October 2012, Pacific Rim signed a deal with Crowell & Moring to represent their case in the final phase of arbitration, which was being handled by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). In October 2016, the ICSID dismissed Pacific Rim's claim for an eventual amount of $250 million, ruling that their case was \\"without merit.\\" Pacific Rim was also ordered to pay the Salvadoran government $8 million in legal fees.

Gerard Hobbs, \\"Is Abbot Isidore also among the prophets?: Protestant influences upon the annotated Bible of Isidore Clarius\\", in: Renaissance and Reformation vol. 17, no. 1 (1973), pp. 53-71. and an editor of an edition of the Vulgate. Born Taddeo Cucchi in Chiari, Brescia in 1495, of modest ancestry. He had a brother, Basilio, who died in 1531. His boyhood teacher was Angelo Claretto, who enjoyed some poetical gifts. Around the age of fifteen, he fell in love with a girl, but she died.Gussago, p. 8-9. Monk, Prior, and Abbot He took the name Isidorus Clarius at his profession as a Benedictine on 24 June 1517 at the abbey of Saint John in Parma.Gussago, pp. 12-13. Giordano, p. 647. He made rapid progress in both sacred and secular literature. During his years in Parma, he appears to have suffered from continual intestinal problems. In 1527, he wrote to his friend Leander at Modena that it felt like the cave of the winds. In the autumn when he was in Brescia, he consulted a physician, who prescribed asses' milk.Gussago, pp. 15-22: \\"Semper tamen eccipio familiarem meum antrum Aeoli, et interiorem illum tortorem, qui mihi perpetuus comes fuit.... Sed hisce diebus veni in aliquam spem, aut sublatum iri hunc morbum, aut esse magna ex parte leniendum, atque de hoc postremo quidem bene speramus, nam illa altera spes non parum anceps est, et incerta, cum plerique omnem hujus generis malo curationem, desperent.\\" In 1528 he travelled with some brothers to the monastery of Torchiara (Turres Claras), on orders of Pope Clement VII who had assigned the monastery in Parma to other occupants. But the size of Torchiara was such that it could not hold all the brothers, and therefore, after complaints to Rome, with papal permission they returned to Parma.Gussago, pp. 23-24. A letter was written by Isidore from Torchiara dated 31 October 1528: Gussago, p. 34. In 1534 he was at Montecassino,Gussago, pp. 26-28. Isidore wrote to Abbot Ambrogio of Florence on 15 August 1534 from Rome that he had been to Montecassino, where he greatly enjoyed their collection of books. and in c. 1535 he and his mentor (praeceptor) Gregory Cortese were transferred to Rome. Corteste had been appointed to Pope Paul III's Concilium delectorum cardinalium et aliorum praelatorum de emendanda Ecclesia.Gussago, pp. 24-25. Giordano, p. 647, places the date c. 1536-1537. Ludwig von Pastor, The History of the Popes Volume XI (London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner 1912), pp. 154-155, places the official summons in the second half of July 1536, and remarks that most of those summoned were already in Rome in the last week of October 1536. Esteemed as well for his purity, charity, and eloquence, he was appointed prior of the monastery of St Peter in Modena in 1537.Isidore wrote to Cardinal Pole from the monastery of S. Pietro in Modena on 7 October 1537. Gussano, p. 36. His mentor, Gregory Cortese, wrote to Cardinal Gasparo Contarini, expressing the hope that Chiari would be consoled by the pleasing conversation. Gussago, pp. 30-31: \\"E perch√® penso, V. S. Reverendissima acer√† grato intendere nuova del nostro P. D. Isidoro, la sapr√†, come essendo gi√† da molti anni affezionato alli genii, ed ingegni Modenesi, ora si √® ridutto ad abitare con loro fatto Priore di quel monastero, dove per la bella, e grata con versazione, non dubito sar√† consolatissimo.\\" In 1540 he was summoned to Mantua to attend the General Chapter of the Benedictine Order, where he presented a public oration. He was elected abbot of the monastery of Pontida in the diocese of Brescia, then of S. Maria di Cesena. He was still abbot of S. Maria when he appeared at the opening of the Council of Trent.Gussago, p. 31-32. Scholar Chiari's edition of the Vulgate (1542) In 1540 he published his Adhortatio ad Concordiam, already written by 1538 and dedicated to his friend Cardinal Gasparo Contarini. It was a plea to Lutherans and Catholics to focus on common grounds, rather than seek points of difference. Massimo Zaggia, \\"Culture in Lombardy, 1535‚Äì1706, in: In 1541 he published an edition of the New Testament in Latin which was followed one year later by the whole Vulgate Bible in Venice by Peter Sch√∂ffer. Most notable is his revision following the Hebrew text of the Song of Songs with extensive commentary; it became the text for ten motets by Gioseffo Zarlino. His efforts on behalf of the Bible and the Song of Songs were part of a larger spiritual movement among the Cassinese Congregations emphasizing the restoration of the Imago Dei in man as the primary significance of justification. He was granted the privilege of being a mitred abbot by Pope Paul III In June 1545, the General Council of the Congregatio Cassinense of the Order of Saint Benedict met in Mantua in anticipation of the opening of the Council of Trent. They elected three of their abbots to represent them at the council, one of whom was Isidore of S. Maria (Cesena). At the opening, the issue was raised as to whether abbots had votes in the council sessions, and it was finally decided on 4 January 1546 that the three Benedictine abbots would share one vote.Giordano, p. 648. At the council in February and May of 1546, he successfully argued for an honored place for the Latin Vulgate along with the tradition of the Church. His own edition of the Vulgate was put on the Index in 1559, and a new edition of it was authorized in 1564, but \\"deprived of the preface and of the prolegomenas, because those were manifestly sympathizing with the Lutheran heresy\\" Bishop of Foligno Following the council, on 24 January 1547, he was appointed bishop of Foligno Cf.: on the recommendation of Cardinals Reginald Pole, Giovanni Andrea Cortese, and Jacopo Sadoleto. Giordano, p. 648. At the beginning of his tenure, Bishop Isidoro summoned and presided over a diocesan synod, which met on 14 November 1547.First Synod: Gussago, pp. 45-49. He held a second synod on 22 October 1548.Second Synod: Gussago, pp. 49-52. A third synod took place on 14 October 1549,Third Synod: Gussago, pp. 52-53. and a fourth on 15 October 1550.Fourth Synod: Gussago, pp. 54-59. In his diocese Bishop Chiari gained a reputation for his instruction of the poor; in 1547 he organized the \\"Society of Saint Martin\\", composed of twelve prominent men of the diocese to deal with the shameful condition of the poor.Giordano, p. 648. He encouraged the promotion of literature, and especially the Greek language, through an academy which he founded. In 1548 he invited into his diocese the Jesuit Silvestro Landini, who helped organize confraternities for the youth to encourage frequent confession.Gussago, pp. 61-62. In 1551, Bishop Chiari began to preach a series of sermons in the Cathedral on the subject of the Gospel of Saint Luke. His view, expressed in his synods, was that preaching was a prime duty of the clergy, and at the same time he wanted his people to hear the word of God. He therefore preached on a chapter of the Gospel of Luke each week, following successively in order. His series of sermons was interrupted by his death. He was stricken by a fever, and died on 18 March 1555.Eubel, p. 199. His remains were displayed in the cathedral of Foligno, where he was buried in an emotional funeral service. He and his edition of the Vulgate are mentioned by name in the preface of the King James Bible.

Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was founded on 12 August 1970 after the merger of Paris Football Club and Stade Saint- Germain. PSG made an immediate impact, winning promotion to Ligue 1 and claiming the Ligue 2 title in their first season. Their momentum was soon checked, however, and the club split in 1972. Paris FC remained in Ligue 1, while PSG were administratively relegated to Division 3. PSG got their revenge in 1974 when they returned to Ligue 1 and Paris FC slipped into the division below. The club also moved into Parc des Princes that same year. The club's trophy cabinet welcomed its first major silverware in the shape of the Coupe de France in 1982, during a decade marked by players such as Safet Su≈°iƒá, Luis Fern√°ndez and Dominique Rocheteau. PSG then claimed its maiden league title in 1986, after which they went into decline. But a takeover by television giants Canal+ revitalised the club and PSG entered their golden era. Led by David Ginola, George Weah and Ra√≠, the club won nine trophies during the 1990s. Most notably, the Parisians claimed a second league title in 1994 and their crowning glory, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. At the start of the 21st century, PSG struggled to rescale the heights despite the magic of Ronaldinho and the goals of Pauleta. Five more trophies arrived in the form of three Coupe de France, one Coupe de la Ligue and one UEFA Intertoto Cup, but the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another. Indeed, Paris Saint-Germain spent two seasons staving off relegations that were only very narrowly avoided. This changed in 2011 with the arrival of new majority shareholders Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). Since the buyout, PSG have signed several stars like Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, Thiago Silva, Edinson Cavani, Neymar and Kylian Mbapp√©, and have dominated French football, winning seven of the last eight Ligue 1 titles. Despite this, the UEFA Champions League has proven to be a trophy beyond their reach. Since 2012, they have reached the quarter-finals on five occasions, as well as exited the competition in the round of 16 three times. PSG reached the semi-finals of the 2019‚Äì20 Champions League for the first time since 1995. Afterwards, the team defeated RB Leipzig and reached the UCL final for the first time in their history. Early years (1970‚Äì1972) =Creation and Real Madrid link= In the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital. Guy Crescent and Pierre-√âtienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris Football Club (PFC), with Stade Saint- Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15km west of Paris, won promotion to Ligue 2. PFC was created a in 1969, while Stade Saint-Germain was founded in 1904. Real Madrid played a big role in the foundation of Paris Saint-Germain. Developing football in Paris was a great ambition in 1969, since the City of Lights didn't have an elite football team. PSG's future board of directors Crescent, Guyot and Patrelle were stuck with a problem related to the financing of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernab√©u. Bernab√©u told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team. After a petition was signed by 20,000 people, the merger went through and Paris Saint-Germain Football Club were formed on 17 June 1970. For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a football club. Guy Crescent founded Paris Saint-Germain on 12 August 1970, alongside Pierre-√âtienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle. The merger was made official following the creation of the Association Paris Saint-Germain Football, Association loi 1901 on 12 August 1970. PSG retains this day as their foundation date, despite the club playing its first match ever earlier that month; it was a friendly against Quevilly (1‚Äì3 defeat) on 1 August. The French Football Federation ratified the merger on 27 August. The PFC Association contributed with the financial backing, while Stade Saint-Germain provided their Division 2 status, Camp des Loges training centre, coach Pierre Phelipon and star players Bernard Guignedoux, Michel Prost and Camille Choquier. Red, blue and white were adopted as the traditional colours of PSG. The red and blue represent the city of Paris, while the white is a symbol of French royalty and stands for the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the birthplace of French King Louis XIV. =Division 2 title and split= The new capital club built a substantial fanbase thanks to the merger and benefited hugely from an improved squad. PSG, however, strengthened its squad with the signing of France's national team captain Jean Djorkaeff, the club's first star. Paris played their first official game on 23 August 1970, away to Poitiers (1‚Äì1). Led by Djorkaeff, the club won promotion to Division 1 and claimed the 1970‚Äì71 French Division 2 title in its first season. The 1971‚Äì72 French Division 1 campaign would be less illustrious. Paris Saint-Germain ended its inaugural season in the top flight with a safe 16th place, meaning they would continue in Division 1 next year, but the club was in a delicate financial situation. The Paris City Council offered 850,000 francs to pay the club's debt and save its place in Division 1 but in return demanded the club to adopt the more Parisian name of \\"Paris Football Club.\\" PSG president Henri Patrelle refused the name change and financial support was withdrawn. This forced the club to split on 20 June 1972. A faction of directors, led by Guy Crescent and Pierre-√âtienne Guyot, who backed the local authorities re-formed Paris FC. The latter remained in Division 1 and at Parc des Princes, while the Paris Saint-Germain of Patrelle kept their name but assumed amateur status and were administratively relegated to Division 3. Return to Ligue 1 (1972‚Äì1978) =Back-to-back promotions= Most of the club's stars, including team captain Jean Djorkaeff, preferred to stay in Ligue 1 with Paris FC. As a result, PSG began life in Division 3 with a young but talented squad that would star in the club's forthcoming back-to-back promotions. Some of these gifted youngsters included Christian Andr√©, √âric Renaut, Othniel Dossevi, Michel Marella and Jacques Laposte. Paris would finish second in Group West of the 1972‚Äì73 French Division 3, six points behind Quevilly, missing out on promotion by little. Fortunately, Quevilly had to dissolve due to financial problems shortly after the end of the season and PSG took their place in Ligue 2 by default. PSG really took flight when fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over. Shortly before the start of the 1973‚Äì74 campaign, he replaced Henri Patrelle as president and named Francis Borelli as vice- president. Besides offering his financial support to the club, Hechter also designed PSG's classic home outfit. He then shocked the national game as he appointed French legend Just Fontaine as coach and signed several prestigious players like Jean-Pierre Dogliani, Jean Deloffre and Louis Cardiet. Just Fontaine took PSG back to Ligue 1 in 1974. The Parisians finished second in Group B of the 1973‚Äì74 French Division 2, four points behind Red Star, qualifying for the Ligue 1 playoffs against Valenciennes. The winner of this double-legged match would be promoted to the top flight. Valenciennes won 2‚Äì1 at home, but PSG recorded an incredible 4‚Äì2 comeback in the second game, thus winning promotion to the 1974‚Äì75 French Division 1 and regaining its professional status abandoned two years earlier. Overwhelmed by emotion, Fontaine collapsed on the lawn, victim of a heart attack. Fortunately, he recovered and was carried by the players in celebration. Since then, PSG have always played in Ligue 1. =PSG moves into Parc des Princes= Ironically, Paris FC were relegated to Ligue 2 that same year and Paris Saint-Germain moved into Parc des Princes, which up until that point had been the home stadium of PFC. Before that, PSG had been playing at several grounds including Stade Municipal Georges Lef√®vre, Stade Jean-Bouin, Stade Bauer, and even Parc des Princes a few times that season despite the reluctance of PFC. Indeed, PSG played their first game at Parc des Princes against Red Star on 10 November 1973, as a curtain-raiser for that season's opening Ligue 1 match between Paris FC and Sochaux. PSG won 3‚Äì1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club's first goal at the stadium. PSG's tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs also started in the 1973‚Äì74 edition. The Parisians reached the quarterfinals after beating Metz at Parc des Princes in front of 25,000 spectators, before being ousted by Stade de Reims. Though failing to challenge for the domestic title in the 1970s, the club narrowly bowed out in the semifinals of the 1974‚Äì75 Coupe de France to Lens and slowly began attracting several stars. The first of them was Mustapha Dahleb, who signed from Sedan for 1.3m francs in 1974, a then French transfer record. Up next was Carlos Bianchi in June 1977. The Argentine striker, who scored 37 goals in 38 matches in his first season, was the last big signing of Daniel Hechter. In January 1978, Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation for running a corruption scheme involving ticket sales at Parc des Princes. In his final match at the stadium as club president, PSG beat Olympique de Marseille 5‚Äì1 as Mustapha Dahleb offered him the match ball after the final whistle. Hechter was then carried in triumph by the players while the whole stadium chanted his name. Francis Borelli, who had been vice-president until then, became the new boss of the √éle-de-France club. Francis Borelli years (1978‚Äì1991) =First major trophy= Despite the departure of Daniel Hechter, the stars kept coming to Parc des Princes under the 13-year-tenure of Francis Borelli. Dominique Bathenay left Saint-√âtienne for the capital in 1978, followed by ¬´The Green Angel¬ª, Dominique Rocheteau, two years later. Led by coach Georges Peyroche since 1979, the Parisians established themselves as a top-half team in Ligue 1 and reached their first Coupe de France final in the 1981‚Äì82 edition. There were nearly 150,000 requests for only 46,160 seats available at Parc des Princes to see PSG go up against the great Saint-√âtienne of Michel Platini, who was playing his last match in France before leaving for Juventus. Nabatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG in the 58th minute following a good cross from Ivica ≈†urjak. However, Saint-√âtienne reacted and Platini equalized in the 78th minute to send the game to extra-time. Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead in the 99th minute. Parc des Princes no longer believed in their team when Rocheteau, after yet another assist from ≈†urjak, scored an unexpected equalizer against his former team in the last seconds of the match. Dominique Rocheteau scored one of the club's most iconic goals ever. PSG fans then invaded the field in joy, while their president, Francis Borelli, famously kneeled and kissed the lawn of Parc des Princes. After 30 minutes of interruption, the penalty shootout sealed PSG's coronation. Parisian goalkeeper Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-√âtienne's last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for PSG. Barely 12 years after their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain had won their first major title in their home stadium. =European debut= This success opened PSG the doors to Europe for the first time in their history. It was also a first for a Parisian club since the 1960s, when Racing Paris and Stade Fran√ßais participated in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. PSG made their European debut in a 1982‚Äì83 European Cup Winners' Cup first round tie against Lokomotiv Sofia in Bulgaria. They lost 1‚Äì0 in Sofia, but played champagne football at home to win 5‚Äì1 with Nabatingue Toko scoring a superb half volley that sealed PSG's qualification to the quarterfinals. Waterschei appeared to be the perfect draw as PSG avoided top teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or Inter Milan. The first leg against the Belgian Cup winners was played in Paris. This match was PSG's first major European meeting, reflected in the 49,575 spectators at Parc des Princes, the club's all-time attendance record. PSG largely dominated and won 2‚Äì0 in a great match from Luis Fern√°ndez. The score could have been larger though, a fact the Parisians would regret. In the return leg, PSG lost 3‚Äì0 after extra time and were knocked out from the competition in a very tense and controversial match that saw the capital side finish with nine men. Paris would have to wait until 1993 to reach a European quarterfinal again. =Maiden league crown= Paris SG repeated the feat in the 1982‚Äì83 Coupe de France, this time against Nantes. Recently crowned French champions, the Canaries were headed for the league-cup double, leading 1‚Äì2 at the break. However, PSG's star signing of the summer, Safet Su≈°iƒá, equalized in the second half, before assisting Toko for the winning goal. Once again, PSG had qualified for the 1982‚Äì83 European Cup Winners' Cup, where the club faced a big European club for the first time in the form of the Juventus of Michel Platini. It would be the first of several memorable games against the Italian team. PSG rose to the occasion, drawing both matches and only bowing out on away goal rule despite being really close to winning the tie in Italy. The capital side then reached the 1984‚Äì85 Coupe de France final, its third in four years. This time, however, the Parisians lost to Monaco after an already difficult season which saw them finish the league in 13th place. They were also shocked by surprise finalists Videoton in the second round of the 1984‚Äì85 UEFA Cup. PSG lost both matches, the first of them a blushing 4‚Äì2 defeat at Parc des Princes. It was a little over a year after the cup loss to the principality side that Paris conquered France. Under the guidance of G√©rard Houllier, who had replaced Georges Peyroche as team coach at the start of the season, PSG were crowned 1985‚Äì86 French Division 1 champions for the first time in their history. Led by Su≈°iƒá, Jo√´l Bats, Luis Fern√°ndez and Dominique Rocheteau, the Red and Blues dominated the championship from start to finish, going a memorable 26 matches without defeat towards the title. =Decline and Canal+ takeover= The follow-up to the league title wasn't as glorious though. PSG finished seventh in the 1986‚Äì87 French Division 1 and their first UEFA Champions League appearance that season was a complete failure. They were knocked out by minnows V√≠tkovice in the first round of the 1986‚Äì87 European Cup. A year later, the club avoided relegation from the 1987‚Äì88 French Division 1 on the final match after a 4‚Äì1 win over Lens at Parc des Princes. PSG then briefly bounced back, fighting for the 1988‚Äì89 French Division 1 title with Olympique de Marseille. In May 1989, the two sides met for the title decider at Stade V√©lodrome in a match that would set the tone for the years that followed. PSG president Francis Borelli and his Marseille counterpart Bernard Tapie cranked up the temperature by exchanging provocations before the game. The championship looked to be heading to Paris with the score tied at 0‚Äì0 and only a few seconds remaining. Played out amid a tense, frenzied atmosphere, the match was settled in the 90th minute when Franck Sauz√©e drilled a shot past PSG goalkeeper Jo√´l Bats from 25 yards, effectively sealing OM's first title in 17 years. PSG quickly returned to their disappointing trend though, with below par results in the league as well as another European elimination to Juventus in the 1989‚Äì90 UEFA Cup despite a close tie. Between 1984 and 1989, the club's budget also skyrocketed to compete with Racing Paris for recognition as the capital's top team. As a result, PSG's debts kept rising and, eventually, the club went into decline. In April 1991, after yet another defeat, PSG supporters demanded the resignation of Francis Borelli. The club was in great danger of bankruptcy as well and poor results had translated into low attendance levels. A month later, Borelli accepted to sell the club to French television giants Canal+. Golden era (1991‚Äì1998) =Real Madrid comeback and third cup title= George Weah after scoring for PSG away to Napoli in the 1992‚Äì93 UEFA Cup. The takeover by French TV channel Canal+ revitalised Paris Saint-Germain, whose 40% of its income came from televised games, allowing them to become one of the richest clubs in France. They wiped out PSG's huge 50 million francs debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli. Now enjoying serious investment, PSG were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years. In consequence, Canal+ increased the club's budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991‚Äì92 season. The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986‚Äì87 European Cup trophy, and the departure of eleven players including PSG legend Safet Su≈°iƒá. The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier and Patrick Colleter. Despite criticism over Artur Jorge's solid but unpleasant playing style, PSG managed to attain the objectives in his first season in charge, reviving the enthusiasm among Parisian fans and average attendance soaring to more than 25,000 spectators at Parc des Princes. Paris finished third in the 1991‚Äì92 French Division 1 and qualified for the 1992‚Äì93 UEFA Cup, reaching a European semifinal for the first time in its history. After an easy first round against PAOK, PSG defeated Napoli and Anderlecht ‚Äî two resounding European names but whose best days had already passed ‚Äî and qualified for the quarterfinals where they were paired with the great Real Madrid. The Parisians fell to a 3‚Äì1 defeat in the first leg at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium, seriously complicating their chances of qualification. PSG learned their lesson, though, and managed the club's biggest comeback in the second leg. They were 3‚Äì0 up in added time with goals from George Weah, David Ginola and Valdo, when the Spanish side pulled one back, momentarily forcing extra time. Paris were given a free kick near Real's area in the final seconds of regular time and Antoine Kombouar√©, just like against Anderlecht in the previous round, rose higher than anyone else to send his team to the semifinals with a fantastic header that made him a club legend. PSG supporters nicknamed him \\"Gold Helmet\\" after this goal. Unfortunately, PSG's fairy tale was cut short by their b√™te noire, Juventus, in the last four. In France, the capital club defeated the Nantes of future Parisian players Claude Mak√©l√©l√© and Patrice Loko in the final to claim the 1992‚Äì93 Coupe de France, its third title overall, without conceding a single goal throughout the entire competition, a record only matched by PSG itself in the 2016‚Äì17 Coupe de France. Coincidentally, the 3‚Äì0 rout over Nantes came almost exactly ten years after their last French Cup win in 1983 and against the same team. It was the first title of the Canal+ era as well as PSG's first since 1986. =The French cl√°sico is born= 2006 and 2016 French Cup titles. The 1992‚Äì93 season also marked the beginning of Le Classique, the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille, as both teams battled each other on the field for the 1992‚Äì93 French Division 1 crown. PSG finished runners-up after losing both games against Marseille. The first match, played at Parc des Princes on 18 December 1992, was so brutal that earned itself the nickname \\"The Butchery of 1992.\\" It was on this day that the French cl√°sico was born. PSG coach Artur Jorge announced his side would crush Marseille, while Parisian player David Ginola promised war upon them. To motivate his players, l'OM president Bernard Tapie stuck the newspaper articles with PSG's provocations in the dressing room. Marseille would not disappoint him, walking away with the victory thanks to a strike from Alen Bok≈°iƒá in what was an extremely violent match with more than 50 fouls. In the second match, only three days after winning the 1992‚Äì93 UEFA Champions League, league leaders Marseille welcomed closest challengers PSG in a match that would determine the title. l'OM quickly fell behind, only to hit back with three goals, including one of the fixture's best goals: a team effort finished by an 18-yard header from Basile Boli. This would have been Marseille's fifth consecutive championship. Shortly after, however, Tapie and l'OM were found guilty of match-fixing in what became known as the French football bribery scandal. The French Football Federation stripped l'OM of their title and offered it to second-placed PSG, who refused it because club owners Canal+ thought that claiming the trophy would anger their subscribers back in Marseille. As a result, the 1992‚Äì93 title remains unattributed. Canal+ even refused letting the capital club participate in next year's Champions League after UEFA excluded l'OM from the competition. Third-placed Monaco took the spot instead. l'OM were then forcibly relegated to Ligue 2 in 1994 for lacking the necessary funds to continue among the elite. Marseille and their fans have since accused PSG of plotting against them to become the new kings of French football. =Second league title and cup double= That defeat notwithstanding, the club were on the move and between 1993 and 1997 they contested two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals (in 1996 and 1997), reached the UEFA Champions League semi-finals once and twice advanced to the same stage of the UEFA Cup. PSG's crowning glory came with triumph in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, Bruno N'Gotty hitting the only goal as Rapid Wien were defeated 1‚Äì0. A year later, the Parisians finished runners-up to Barcelona in the same competition. On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying, with PSG celebrating another Ligue 1 title, three French Cups, two French League Cups and just as many French Trophy of Champions wins. At the time, the players lighting up Parc des Princes were also mainstays of their national sides. Bernard Lama, Alain Roche, Paul Le Guen, Vincent Gu√©rin, David Ginola and Youri Djorkaeff all enjoyed stints with France, while Ricardo, Valdo, Ra√≠ and Leonardo were regulars for Brazil. But perhaps the greatest talent of all was prolific Liberian marksman George Weah, who followed in the footsteps of PSG's many fine strikers by firing 55 goals in 137 games. Decline and revival (1998‚Äì2011) PSG's team during the 2008‚Äì09 season. PSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement. The club's form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable. After years of underachievement, Canal+ sold the club to Colony Capital, Butler Capital Partners and Morgan Stanley in 2006. Colony Capital eventually bought out Morgan Stanley's shares in the club to become 95% owners. Five more trophies arrived (three French Cups, one League Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup) and Parc des Princes faithful also got to marvel at the likes of Marco Simone, Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka, Ronaldinho, Gabriel Heinze, Juan Pablo Sor√≠n, Mario Yepes and Pauleta. However, the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another. Indeed, PSG spent the 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 seasons staving off relegations that were only very narrowly avoided. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, the club only avoided relegation on the final day. PSG struggled throughout the campaign and spent many games in the relegation zone. After a difficult season on and off the pitch, marked by poor results and violence between some fans, PSG avoided relegation to Ligue 2 on the final match after a 2‚Äì1 win at Sochaux. The savior was Ivorian striker Amara Dian√© who scored both PSG goals that night. Today, Dian√© is still a hero for most Parisian fans. Domestic hegemony (2011‚Äìpresent) =Third league title= Paris Saint-Germain were transformed into a top team in 2011, when the club was purchased by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) after two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouar√© and president Robin Leproux. The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world. QSI and new club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's biggest name. PSG returned to the UEFA Champions League in 2012‚Äì13. Club legend Leonardo was brought back in a sporting director capacity and oversaw a spending spree in summer 2011 that has so far been unprecedented in Ligue 1 history. Despite finishing behind Montpellier in 2011‚Äì12, the elusive league crown was finally brought back to Paris in 2012‚Äì13 driven by star player Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, team captain Thiago Silva and famous manager Carlo Ancelotti. Zlatan's 30-goal haul almost single-handedly led the capital side to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years, and third overall. However, PSG were unlucky to be eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on away goals Barcelona in the quarter-finals after drawing both games. =National quadruples and European breakthrough= Big money signings continued with the arrivals of Edinson Cavani in 2013 and David Luiz in 2014. Despite the departure of Carlo Ancelotti, PSG kept its winning ways under Laurent Blanc. The club secured a maiden domestic treble (Ligue 1, Coupe de la Ligue and Troph√©e des Champions) in the 2013‚Äì14 season, before claiming an unprecedented national quadruple (Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Troph√©e des Champions) twice in a row in 2014‚Äì15 and 2015‚Äì16. However, Blanc's teams were never able to advance past the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League, a goal that president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and ownership group QSI made clear was the ultimate benchmark for the club's success. Fresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla, Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree. But with star player Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá gone, the club endured a disappointing 2016‚Äì17 season. Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco, missing out on top spot for the first time in five years. Additionally, PSG surrendered a 4‚Äì0 first-leg lead over Barcelona with a historic 6‚Äì1 thrashing at Camp Nou in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League. Nevertheless, they secured another domestic cup treble, claiming the Troph√©e des Champions, the Coupe de la Ligue and the Coupe de France. In response, PSG assembled a fearsome attacking trio composed of Edinson Cavani and world-record signings Neymar and Kylian Mbapp√© in the 2017‚Äì18 campaign. The capital club reclaimed the Ligue 1 title and successfully defended the three cups, clinching the domestic quadruple for the third time in four seasons. But, with Parisian fans promised European glory in light of their massive expenditure, these victories on the national stage were not enough after their UEFA Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid in the round of 16. As a result, Unai Emery left the club at the end of the season. Paris Saint-Germain again fell in the Champions League round of 16 in 2018‚Äì19, suffering a shock 1‚Äì3 defeat at home to Manchester United after winning the first leg 0‚Äì2 at Old Trafford. This season, they won the Ligue 1 for the 8th time in their history, but lost in the Coupe de France final against Rennes. PSG were eliminated from the Coupe de la Ligue in embarrassing fashion, as they lost 1‚Äì2 at home to EA Guingamp in the quarterfinals. However, the team defeated the same opposition by a margin of 9‚Äì0 ten days later in the league.https://www.goal.com/en/news/paris-saint-germain-equal-club-record-in- guingamp-demolition/1wx9o0d9mwq461thr92osscbpf In 2019‚Äì20, PSG won the Ligue 1 for the 9th time in their history, following the title being awarded to them based on PPG ratio as the season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the lockdown ended, they also reclaimed the Coupe de France after defeating Saint-√âtienne in the final, and the last-ever Coupe de la Ligue with a penalty shootout win over Lyon in the final on 31 July. In the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Champions League, PSG reached the semi-finals for the second time since 1995, after a 2‚Äì1 win over Atalanta, and then reached its first-ever final by defeating RB Leipzig 3‚Äì0. In a tightly contested final PSG lost to Bayern Munich 0‚Äì1.

The case applied the Baker framework for analysing the duty of fairness owed by an administrative decision-maker to a zoning request made to a municipality and found that the municipal government owed a duty of procedural fairness to the applicant in the way that it assessed and responded to their rezoning application. Facts The Congr√©gation des t√©moins de J√©hovah de St-J√©r√¥me-Lafontaine (\\"the congregation\\") desired to build a place of worship in the village of Lafontaine, Quebec. According to the Act respecting land use planning and development, such a religious establishment must be on land with a \\"P-3\\" zoning designation. The congregation was not able to locate any suitable land for sale with such a designation. Consequently, the congregation entered into an agreement to purchase a plot of land with a different zoning, the sale being conditional on the municipality authorizing the re-zoning of the land. The municipality refused the request to re-zone the land after conducting an extensive study and providing detailed reasons for the decision, which primarily related to residential tax rates.Congr√©gation des t√©moins de J√©hovah de St-J√©r√¥me-Lafontaine v. Lafontaine (Village), 2004 SCC 48, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 650, para. 19. The congregation responded to the municipality's decision by finding a different piece of land and again applied for rezoning of that land. The municipality then summarily denied that rezoning application, noting only that P-3 land was available elsewhere. When the congregation was again unable to find suitable land zoned P-3, after a four-year-long search, they applied for a third time to the municipality to rezone a piece of land which they could purchase. The municipality again summarily denied their application without providing reasons. At this point, the congregation turned to the courts to challenge the fairness of the municipality's decision. Decisiont =Duty of municipality= In order to determine the duty that the municipality owed to the congregation, the court applied the five-part test from Baker. The court concluded that the municipality owed a duty of fairness to the congregation after assessing the five factors: # The nature of the decision and the decision-making process employed by the public organ # The nature of the statutory scheme and the precise statutory provisions pursuant to which the public body operates # The importance of the decision to the individuals affected # The legitimate expectations of the party challenging the decision # The nature of the deference accorded to the body Specifically, the court ruled that the content of the duty of procedural fairness owed the congregation was that the municipality was required to carefully evaluate the congregation's applications for a zoning variance and to give reasons for refusing the applications.Congr√©gation des t√©moins de J√©hovah de St-J√©r√¥me- Lafontaine v.

Lafontaine (Village), 2004 SCC 48, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 650, para. 30. Accordingly, the court set aside the second and third rezoning refusals as they did not comply with the law. The court ordered the municipality to reconsider the congregation's application. The congregation had argued that such as a remedy was inadequate because it argued that the municipality was likely to again refuse the application though with proper reasons. However, the court rejected that argument because it implies that the congregation was entitled to a particular substantive decision, instead of merely to a fair process. Additionally, the court was unable to conclude on the facts whether or not the municipality was acting in bad faith in denying the congregation's second and third rezoning applications.Congr√©gation des t√©moins de J√©hovah de St-J√©r√¥me- Lafontaine v.

Galouye, published in April 1963 by Bantam Books. The Library of Congress Catalog Card Number is 63009177. Daniel Galouye wrote this story in 1963. It was his second novel, following the successful Dark Universe, and reflects his interest in worlds where one's perception of reality is the key factor affecting that reality and the most important element of it. Setting The novel is set 15 years after the devastation of earth. A band of holdout soldiers remain steadfast to their military/defensive duty, and are based in a deserted junior college in the shadow of a strange, towering, alien City of Force. Wherever the aliens have established themselves, they have raised up great walled cities comprising huge buildings shaped like cylinders, pyramids, cubes, rhombohedrons, semi-transparent prisms, and balls. Electric equipment all over the earth has been shut down by the aliens, and all of human civilization has been driven back to a coal and steam-based technology. The Cities of Force are the home of the ‚ÄúSpheres‚Äù. They are large floating aliens that generally ignore humans except when they decide to ‚Äúselect‚Äù someone. Then they hover and float through the air, crackling with static electricity and hunting the selected person apparently for sport. Spheres can travel right through walls and hillsides in their pursuit of the selected people. When they finally run down the prey, they throw lightning bolts to kill the human. The Spheres also get active around the time of Horror Day, an annual event when a grid of energy forms over the earth and somehow inflicts incredible physical and mental torture on the earthlings, which takes months for the populace to recover from. Plot synopsis The novels starts on September 24, 1993 (at the time of writing, thirty years in the future) and Captain Geoffery Maddox, U.S. Army is leading a detail from the headquarters of the Third Army against a target. The detail consists of a retired U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer, a Marine Corporal, a Marine Private, an Army Private, and a civilian scout. They are the members of the only known military force left on Earth, and they try to smuggle the last known atomic bomb into one of the mysterious alien structures that now dot the surface of the Earth. They desperately hope that setting off a fifty kiloton nuclear explosion can disrupt the operation of the structure and thereby lessen the effects of what is known as \\"Horror Day,\\" or \\"H-Day\\". Their plan backfires, and the city completely absorbs the fifty-kiloton explosion. The following H-Day is exceptionally bad. After a recovery period lasting a few months, the people in the nearby villages are angry at the Third Army. They believe that the alien city should be left alone, and then the aliens might leave the villagers alone. They start launching small scale attacks against the base and sniping at the soldiers. At about the same time, a stranger shows up at the military base. He has stolen something from a distant City of Force. There are many such Cities of Force scattered around the world, and together they create and support the grid that causes Horror Day. The stranger presents two glowing rings, one green and one yellow. They seem weightless and can be stretched to any size and broken to form more rings just like the original. When they are held with the green ring within the yellow one, they spew forth glowing plasma which is the basis of the alien cities. When the positions are reversed and the yellow is put inside the green, the rings re-absorb the plasma. The plasma can take any shape or color, can be accommodating or hostile, and is very hard for the soldiers to figure out. One old soldier, who used to be a scientist and is now the base's doctor, spends weeks trying to understand the rings. He makes some progress, but the scientific method can't shed too much light on how the plasma works because it takes on whatever properties the doctor wants. If he thinks it should be hard, it becomes hard. If he thinks it should be a liquid, it becomes a liquid. Later, the doctor is found dead in his lab, hanging from a rope of plasma. Maddox thinks that while he was drunk, his subconscious mind took control of the plasma and gave him the peace he so desperately wanted for years. Apparently, the plasma can be controlled by the conscious and unconscious mind. Maddox comes up with a solution; he takes the rings away from the base, and while completely alone, works with them trying to find out how to control the plasma. During his time away he meets a young lady named Edie, who for some time has been harboring a baby sphere. This is very surprising to Maddox, as the spheres are feared. However, this one has taken to Edie and continually follows her around. Maddox, helped by the girl's uncle, is able to observe and learn about the nature of spheres. Maddox comes up with the theory that the plasma responds to both the conscious and the subconscious contents of the minds of those who are around it. Maddox decides that he is going to have to find a way to control his subconscious if he wants to learn to control the plasma. He works with the rings and the plasma while going through a kind of ‚Äúhouse cleaning‚Äù of his subconscious mind and becomes better able to control the mysterious plasma. He feels that controlling the plasma is the key to destroying the Cities of Force. As he progresses in his work with the plasma, he becomes telepathic, and can telepathically communicate with Edie. They work out a plan to abandon the baby Sphere, as it has been getting bigger and more dangerous, by going to the nearby City of Force. When they get to the city they discover that they are able to affect the city with their newly concentrated minds. They can create walls, doors, and structures. Maddox isn't perfect in his control; he makes some mistakes, especially while unsuccessfully trying to protect a pregnant woman who is close to giving birth. The spheres do not allow new babies to live, and there haven't been a birth since the Spheres conquered the earth. Maddox and Edie go back to the garrison and convince several of the soldiers to learn how to control the rings because the next Horror Day is soon to arrive. Maddox and Edie train the men, and soon there have a group who are telepathic, can share each other's visual impressions, and can control the plasma to some extent. Their control is imperfect, but they learn to control it enough to build an elaborate plasma structure inside their encampment. Almost a year passes, with another H-Day is coming. During the last year, Maddox has come to the conclusion that H-day happens because the Spheres are trying to move Earth into a different dimension‚Äìreality, and the terrible effects felt on H-day are caused by being in this different place. So far the Spheres have failed to transfer the planet, but they are getting closer each year. That means that when the Spheres succeed, the effects of H-day will never end. Maddox also believes that the Spheres will succeed this year unless he and the other members of his band can do something to disrupt H-day. The people in the surrounding villages are frightened, believing the soldiers experiments with the plasma will upset the Spheres and make H-day even worse than it was the year before. Therefore villagers organize an attack on the base, where at the same time, a band of religious fanatics also decide to attack. The soldiers can't hold their structure up against the mental hysteria of the mobs, and the Spheres join in the attack. As their plasma city of force starts to crumble, Maddox manages to use his new mental powers to transport 18 soldiers who have learned to control the plasma to 18 alien Cities of Force just as the villagers overrun their camp. H-Day commences at that very moment. Maddox can't do any more and can only hope the men he sent out will be able to disrupt the Cities of Force and keep H-day from happening. While experimenting with the rings Maddox found that anything put through a ring will travel in time. The distance traveled in time is controlled by how big the rings are made. Maddox and Edie decide to stretch a ring out to a large size, jump through the ring, and travel through time to the future. They end up at the same site years later where they see a statue depicting their feat and how it freed the earth from domination of the Spheres. Influence Galouye's second novel, Lords of the Psychon, is an expanded and rethought prequel to his earlier novelette, \\"The City of Force\\" (Galaxy: Apr 1959). \\"The City of Force\\" is a much shorter story in which enigmatic aliens consisting of spheres of force have conquered the Earth and set up cities in which humans live essentially like rats in the walls, a theme that was done later in novels by Ken Bulmer, Rob Chilson and William Tenn. The novelette concerns a young man who travels to one of the cities in an effort to communicate with the aliens and convince them humans are intelligent. He does so, but that only makes the invaders more determined than ever to exterminate them. Lords of the Psychon takes place much earlier and rethinks some of the background material.

Ryder helped pioneer Army airborne training, equipment and tactics alongside men like Jim Gavin, William Yarborough, Bill Lee, Art Gorham and Bud Miley. He was an aide to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur from 1944 until 1951. In the early 1960s he was a top Army expert in guided missile systems, retiring as a brigadier general in 1966. First American paratrooper Ryder graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1936. Among his classmates were: Creighton Abrams, Charles Billingslea, William P. Yarborough and William Westmoreland. More than 200 soldiers volunteered to make up the first platoon of paratroopers. Ryder was selected through a competitive written exam that was scheduled to take two hours. He finished it in 45 minutes while still earning the top score. The second highest scorer was Lt. James A. Bassett who thus became the assistant platoon leader.Bassett rose to be a Colonel but was killed in the crash of an Army helicopter in November 1954. The platoon billeted at Lawson Army Air Field near Ft. Benning. Ryder is credited with creating \\"Ryder's Death Ride\\" a 34-foot tower from which trainees practiced jumping. After completing a rigorous conditioning and training program that Ryder had devised, on August 16, 1940, Ryder and ten members of his platoon made their first jump from a Douglas C-33. Ryder was the first man to exit the aircraft. The first enlisted man to jump was Pvt. William N. \\"Red\\" King. The platoon conducted its first mass jump on August 29, 1940.To Be a Paratrooper, by Gregory Mast, Hans Halberstadt, p. 14. Available at Google Books SearchDifferent sources list different dates for this first jump. The August 13, 1940 date was the date given by Brig Gen Ryder in his article, \\"The Parachute Test Platoon,\\" published in USA Airborne, 50th Anniversary, available at Google Books SearchLTC John T. Ellis, Jr. in his 1946 paper, \\"The Army Ground Forces\\" lists the date as August 16th. See page 11 of the document at Dtic.mil In April 1943 while assigned as parachute training officer of the Airborne Command at Camp Mackall, Ryder was temporarily assigned as liaison officer to the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing at Pope Air Force Base. On July 13, 1943, Ryder jumped into Sicily with Colonel James Gavin, commander of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.\\"Recollections of the 542nd Parachute Infantry Regiment,\\" by Brig Gen William T. Ryder, published in USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary, available at Google Books Search After hostilities had ceased in Sicily, Gavin tasked Ryder with returning the personal effects of 1st Battalion commander Arthur F. Gorham to his widow. Gorham was killed during the first few days of the assault and was credited by Gavin with accomplishing all of the Regiment's objectives.A copy of Gavin's letter to Gorham's widow is posted at Letter to Corrine Gorham He is also reported in at least one source to have jumped with the 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment in North Africa as part of Operation Torch in October 1942.The general's obituary posted on the website ArlingtonCemetery.net states that he jumped in North Africa, but there is no mention of this in other sources, and the dates do not appear to verify this fact. See Arlingtoncemetery.net. The general's obituary from the Washington Post (October 20, 1992), only mentions the combat jump in Sicily. Upon his return from Sicily, Ryder was assigned as the regimental commander of the newly formed 542nd Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia. Expecting to be deployed to Europe, Ryder was instead ordered in December 1943 to provide roughly 100 replacements for the Pacific theater. As was customary, Ryder escorted the men by train to the west coast. Upon his arrival at Ft. Ord he was ordered to Ft. Benning \\"first priority.\\" When he returned he received the disheartening news that he was to dispatch 1,000 of his remaining troops to serve as replacements to airborne units in England preparing for the invasion of Europe. The regiment was deactivated on March 17, 1944.\\"William T. Ryder, Army General,\\" Washington Post, October 20, 1992. War and occupation in the Pacific Following promotion to full colonel, in mid-February 1944 Ryder was dispatched to Brisbane, Australia to advise General Douglas MacArthur on airborne operations. He remained a member of MacArthur's staff until President Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951. During the occupation and rebuilding of Japan, Ryder was effectively the chief of staff to MG William F. Marquat.\\"The allied occupation and Japan's economic miracle,\\" by Bowen Causey Deesh, available at Google Books Search During his time in the Pacific, Ryder met his future wife, Muriel, who was serving with the Red Cross there. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Ryder was the deputy chief of the public information division in Paris. By 1963 he was the director of special weapons in the office of the chief of research and development at the Pentagon. In this last post, he was an expert in guided missile systems. The general retired from active duty in 1966 moving to Pinehurst, North Carolina with his wife Muriel. Honors The award given to the most outstanding graduate of the Airborne course at Ft. Benning is named for the general. 1990, General Ryder represented the Airborne to receive a proclamation by North Carolina Governor Jim Martin honoring the 50th anniversary of his first jump. In 1995, the officer's golf course at Ft. Bragg was named for General Ryder. In addition to the Master Parachutist Badge, Ryder's military decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with three Oak Leaf Clusters and the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. General Ryder died due to cancer in 1992 and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

It was signed by Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement. Preferring to keep Guadeloupe, France gave up Canada and all of its claims to territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. With France out of North America this dramatically changed the European political scene on the continent. At first only the imperial powers of Europe had the resources to support and expand settlements in North America. As time went on the colonies became more powerful and sought independence from the Old World. These demands for more autonomy sparked several wars, including the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) and the Mexican War of Independence (1810‚Äì1821). The last major colonial power on the continent, the United Kingdom, granted dominion status to Canada in 1867 and slowly turned over its remaining land to that country over the next 100 years, with the last land transfer being the Dominion of Newfoundland in 1949. Throughout this period, France maintained the small North American territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of the island of Newfoundland. From independence, the United States expanded rapidly to the west, acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803 and fighting a war with Mexico to push west to the Pacific. At the same time, British settlement in Canada increased. US expansion was complicated by the division between \\"free\\" and \\"slave\\" states, which led to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Likewise, Canada faced tensions between settlers, including French and English communities, and the colonial administration that led to the outbreak of civil strife in 1837. Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Texas, which declared itself the Republic of Texas in 1836. In 1845, Texas joined the United States and in 1867 the United States acquired Alaska from Russia. The last major territorial change occurred when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, but there have been a number of small adjustments like the Boundary Treaty of 1970 where the city of Rio Rico, Texas, was ceded to Mexico.

The Kingdom of Great Britain recognized the territory south of what is now Canada, east of the Mississippi and north of Florida as American property. Vermont remained independent until 1791. France regained Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1783 after the Peace of Paris and some residents returned to the islands. 1784 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1784 In 1784, Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov, who later set up the Russian-Alaska Company that colonized early Alaska, arrived in Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island with two ships, the Three Saints and the St. Simon. The indigenous Koniag harassed the Russian party and Shelikhov responded by killing hundreds and taking hostages to enforce the obedience of the rest. Having established his authority on Kodiak Island, Shelikhov founded the second permanent Russian settlement in Alaska (after Unalaska) on the island's Three Saints Bay. ;August 23, 1784 Delegates from the North Carolina counties of Washington, Sullivan, Spencer (now Hawkins) and Greene ‚Äî all in present-day Tennessee ‚Äî convened in the town of Jonesborough and declared the lands the State of Frankland, independent of North Carolina. A constitution modeled on that of North Carolina was adopted with few changes, and the state name was changed to \\"Franklin\\".

This action sparked an international incident that resulted in the Nootka Convention which was signed on October 28, 1790. The conventions stated that the English had the right to found settlements anywhere on the Pacific claimed by Spain but never settled by Spain. As a result claims of sovereignty on the Pacific were determined by settlement or feet on the ground as opposed to claims based on prior discovery.Chiorazzi-Most 2005, p. 958. 1791 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1791 ;March 4, 1791 The Vermont Republic, which included land claimed by New York and New Hampshire and, while unrecognized by the United States, was a de facto independent country, was admitted to the US as the 14th state, Vermont. ;December 26, 1791 The Province of Quebec was divided into two parts, Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The Province of Upper Canada (French: province du Haut-Canada) was a British colony located in what is now the southern portion of the Province of Ontario in Canada. Upper Canada officially existed from 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841. Its name reflected its position higher up the river or closer to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River than that of Lower Canada, present-day southern Quebec. The division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. 1792 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1792 ;March 3, 1792 The US federal government sold the Erie Triangle to Pennsylvania. ;June 1, 1792 The western counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains were split off and admitted to the US as the 15th state, Kentucky. 1793 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1793 Saint Pierre and Miquelon saw action during the French Revolution when France had declared war on the United Kingdom as part of the War of the First Coalition.

It corresponded to present-day Illinois, Indiana, northeastern Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as the western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and all but the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula. Northwest Territory was left with only most of Ohio and the rest of Michigan. ;October 1, 1800 In the secretly negotiated Third Treaty of San Ildefonso (formally titled the Preliminary and Secret Treaty between the French Republic and His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, Concerning the Aggrandizement of His Royal Highness the Infant Duke of Parma in Italy and the Retrocession of Louisiana), Spain returned the colonial territory of Louisiana to France. January 1, 1801 The Kingdom of Great Britain or Great Britain changed its name to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or United Kingdom on January 1, 1801 due to the Act of Union 1800. 1802 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1802 Amiens Treaty of 1802 specified that Saint Pierre and Miquelon would again be returned to France.

The remainder of Northwest Territory was transferred to Indiana Territory. ;April 30, 1803 The Louisiana Purchase was made, expanding the United States west of the Mississippi River. There was a dispute with West Florida over how much land east of the Mississippi River it included. The purchase extended slightly north of the modern borders, as it was defined only as the watershed of the Mississippi River. The purchase consisted of the whole of present-day Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, and portions of Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. It also included the southernmost portions of the present-day Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The cost was 60 million francs ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ($3,750,000). Including interest, the U.S. finally paid $23,213,568 (US$ in ) for the Louisiana territory. ;September 1803 The North West Company organized an overland expedition from Montreal to James Bay and a second expedition by sea. In September 1803, the overland party met the company's ship at Charlton Island in what is now Nunavut. There, they lay claim to the territory that drained into the Arctic in the name of the North West Company.Knafla-Swainger 2005, p. 73. 1805 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1805 ;January 11, 1805 Michigan Territory was split from Indiana Territory, including the whole of the lower peninsula of present-day Michigan but only that eastern tip of the upper peninsula which was held by the Northwest Territory after Indiana Territory had been split from it. ;July 4, 1805 The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana Territory. March 1, 1809 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim_over NAFTA countries c. 1809 Illinois Territory was split from Indiana Territory. Illinois Territory included present-day Illinois, northeastern Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Indiana Territory included the present-day borders of Indiana, with its western and eastern borders continuing northward; thus, it also included the central portion of the upper peninsula of Michigan, as well as Door Peninsula of present-day Wisconsin. 1810 alt=Map showing Non- Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1810 ;September 23, 1810 The short-lived Republic of West Florida declared its independence from Spain. ;October 27, 1810 US President James Madison proclaimed the annexation of the Baton Rouge and Mobile Districts of West Florida, declaring them part of the Louisiana Purchase. The US Army occupied the capital, St. Francisville, on December 6 and Baton Rouge on December 10, bringing an end to the Republic of West Florida after 90 days. 1812 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1812 *April 30.

Oregon Country consisted of most of present- day Idaho and Oregon, all of Washington, and a portion of Montana, as well as the southern part of the unorganized British territory which became British Columbia. The treaty transferred the Red River Basin to the United States, consisting of northwestern Minnesota, northeastern North Dakota, and the northeastern tip of South Dakota. ;December 3, 1818 The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as the 21st state, Illinois. The remainder was reassigned to Michigan Territory. The unorganized lands which had been a part of Indiana Territory prior to the admission of Indiana as a state were also assigned to Michigan Territory. 1819 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1819 ;February 22, 1819 The Adams-On√≠s Treaty or Transcontinental Treaty was signed in Washington, establishing a defined border between the United States and New Spain. The treaty ceded Spain's claims to Oregon Country to the United States and American claims to Texas to Spain; moved portions of present-day Colorado, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, and all of New Mexico and Texas, to New Spain; and all of Spanish Florida as well as a small portion of modern day Colorado to the United States. The new borders intruded on Arkansaw Territory's Miller County, created on April 1, 1820, which dipped below the Red River and into land ceded to Spain. However, the remoteness of the region caused no serious conflict with Spain. ;March 2, 1819 The southern part of Missouri Territory was organized as Arkansaw Territory, consisting of present-day Arkansas as well as part of Oklahoma. It was not officially spelled Arkansas until later. ;December 14, 1819 Alabama Territory was admitted to the US as the 22nd state, Alabama. 1820 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1820 ;March 16, 1820 The Maine District of Massachusetts was split off and admitted to the US as the 23rd state, Maine, as part of the Missouri Compromise. 1821 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1821 ;July 1821 In 1821, the North West Company of Montreal and the Hudson's Bay Company merged, with a combined territory that was further extended by a license to the watershed of the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Pacific Ocean on the west. ;August 10, 1821 The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted to the US as the 24th state, Missouri. The remainder became unorganized. Missouri did not include its northwestern triangle at this point, that being added later in the Platte Purchase. 1824 alt=Map showing Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries c. 1824 ;October 4, 1824 The 1824 Constitution of Mexico was enacted, creating the United Mexican States and replacing the Mexican Empire, which had collapsed on March 19, 1823. The constitution organized the country into 19 states and four territories. In the aftermath of the end of the empire, Central American regions mostly voted not to stay a part of Mexico, with Chiapas, formerly part of Guatemala, being the only area that favored remaining in Mexico. However, rebels in one part of Chiapas, Soconusco, proclaimed its separation from Mexico on July 24, 1824, and it was formally annexed by the Federal Republic of Central America on August 18, 1824. ;November 15, 1824 Arkansas Territory was shrunk, the western portion becoming unorganized. February 28, 1825 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1825 The Treaty of Saint Petersburg of 1825, also known as the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825, defined the boundaries between Russian America and British claims and possessions in the Pacific Northwest of North America at 54 degrees 40 minutes north latitude. 1828 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1828 ;May 6, 1828 Arkansas Territory was shrunk further, attaining the present-day borders of Arkansas, with the remainder again becoming unorganized, excepting the land it still claimed as Miller County. September 30, 1830 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1830 The state of Sonora y Sinaloa was split into two states, Sinaloa and Sonora. 1835 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1835 ;May 23, 1835 The territory of Aguascalientes was split from the state of Zacatecas. ;June 30, 1834 A large portion of unorganized land was added to Michigan Territory, corresponding to present-day Iowa, western Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota and South Dakota. 1836 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1836 ;June 15, 1836 Arkansas Territory was admitted to the US as the 25th state, Arkansas. It continued to claim Miller County, with increasing irrelevance. ;March 2, 1836 Due to disapproval of the government of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, the Tejas region of the state of Coahuila y Tejas declared independence. The remainder was renamed simply Coahuila. The Treaties of Velasco signified the end of the Texas Revolution on May 14, 1836, creating the Republic of Texas. ;July 4, 1836 Wisconsin Territory was split off from Michigan Territory, consisting of present-day Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and eastern North and South Dakota. As an inducement to give up its claim over the Toledo Strip to Ohio, the whole of the present-day upper peninsula was assigned to Michigan Territory, giving it the present-day borders of Michigan. January 26, 1837 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1837 Michigan Territory was admitted to the US as the 26th state, Michigan. ;March 28, 1837 The Platte Purchase added a small area of land to Missouri, giving it its present-day boundaries. July 4, 1838 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1838 Iowa Territory was split off from Wisconsin Territory, consisting of present-day Iowa, western Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota and South Dakota, leaving Wisconsin Territory with northeastern Minnesota and Wisconsin. January 17, 1840 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1840 Voicing the same concerns as Texas, the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas declared independence from Mexico as the Republic of the Rio Grande; since the border of Texas was never conclusively decided, they claim a northern border of the Nueces River, while Texas claims a southern border of the Rio Grande.Mireles- Cotera 2006, p. 53. The rebellion lasted until November 6, 1840. The nation was never fully established, and only existed in the minds of a few. 1841 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1841 ;February 10, 1841 The Province of Canada or the United Province of Canada was created by combining Lower Canada and Upper Canada. It was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867. Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837. The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, when it was redivided into the modern Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Russians were forced to sell Fort Ross due to its economic failure. A private investor, John Sutter, agreed to pay $30,000 (US$ in ) over a three-year period.Kalani- Sweedler 2004, pp. 33-34. 1842 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1842 ;September 11, 1842 The district of Soconusco rejoined Mexico as part of the state of Chiapas. ;November 10, 1842 The Webster-Ashburton Treaty settled the border between the United States and lands held by the United Kingdom east of the Rocky Mountains, ending the disputes over the northern border of the state of Maine and northeastern border of Wisconsin Territory, which today resides in present day Minnesota. 1845 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1845 ;March 3, 1845 Florida Territory was admitted to the US as the 27th state, Florida. ;December 29, 1845 The Republic of Texas was admitted to the US as the 28th state, Texas. The United States Congress passed the joint resolution of annexation on March 1, 1845, but Texas did not agree to join the union for some time after. Although the annexation resolution avoided specifying Texas's boundaries, the U.S. inherited Texas's unenforced claims to South Texas, West Texas, over half of New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and small parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Wyoming. With Texas joining the union, Arkansas finally gave up its claim on Miller County. 1846 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1846 ;January 1, 1846 The state of Yucat√°n declares independence, for the same reasons as the Republic of Texas and Republic of the Rio Grande, forming the Republic of Yucat√°n. ;June 14, 1846 The California Republic, also called the Bear Flag Republic, was proclaimed by settlers in Sonoma in the then-Mexican province of California. Declared during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the republic lasted less than a month. ;June 18, 1846 The Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the Woods as the continental border (so it did not include Vancouver Island) with the lands held by the United Kingdom. The sharing of Oregon Country ended, and the American portion becomes unorganized territory. ;December 28, 1846 The southeast portion of Iowa Territory was admitted to the US as the 29th state, Iowa. The remainder became unorganized. 1848 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1848 ;February 2, 1848 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Mexico ceded the Texas-claimed areas as well as a large area of land consisting of all of present-day California, Nevada, and Utah, most of Arizona, and portions of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. ;August 17, 1848 The Republic of Yucat√°n rejoined Mexico after the Caste War of Yucat√°n forced them to seek outside help. ;May 29, 1848 The southeastern portion of Wisconsin Territory was admitted to the US as the 30th state, Wisconsin. The remainder became unorganized. ;August 14, 1848 Oregon Territory was organized, including present-day Idaho, northwestern Montana, Oregon, Washington, and western Wyoming. 1849 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1849 ;January 13, 1849 Colony of Vancouver Island is formed as a British crown colony. ;March 3, 1849 Minnesota Territory was organized, consisting of present-day Minnesota, and eastern portions of North Dakota and South Dakota. 1850 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1850 ;September 9, 1850 The Compromise of 1850 divided the Mexican Cession and land claimed by Texas but ceded to the federal government in exchange for taking on its debts. The western portion was admitted to the US as the 31st state, California, most of the rest was organized as Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory, and a small portion became unorganized land. New Mexico Territory consisted of most of present-day Arizona and New Mexico, as well as a southern portion of Colorado and the southern tip of Nevada. Utah Territory consisted of present-day Utah, most of Nevada, and portions of Colorado and Wyoming. 1853 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1853 ;March 2, 1853 Washington Territory was split from Oregon Territory, consisting of present-day Washington, northern Idaho, and the western tip of Montana, leaving Oregon Territory with all of Oregon, southern Idaho and a portion of Wyoming. ;December 30, 1853 The Gadsden Purchase added some land to New Mexico Territory, corresponding to the southernmost areas of present-day Arizona and New Mexico. May 30, 1854 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1854 Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory were organized; the remaining unorganized land colloquially became known as Indian Territory. Kansas Territory consisted of present-day Kansas and eastern Colorado. Nebraska Territory consisted of present-day Nebraska, and parts of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Indian Territory corresponds to eastern Oklahoma. A peculiarity appeared at this time, when a small strip of land north of Texas was not officially assigned by any state or territory; this came to be called the Neutral Strip or \\"No Man's Land\\", which corresponds to the present-day panhandle of Oklahoma. February 12, 1857 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1857 The 1857 Constitution of Mexico was adopted, reorganizing some states. Nuevo Le√≥n is merged into Coahuila; Aguascalientes, Colima, and Tlaxcala all had their status changed from territory to state; and the state of Guerrero was created from portions of M√©xico and Puebla. 1858 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1858 ;August 2, 1858 The Colony of British Columbia was a crown colony in British North America from 1858 until 1871. ;May 11, 1858 The eastern portion of Minnesota Territory was admitted to the US as the 32nd state, Minnesota. The remainder became unorganized. 1859 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1859 ;February 14, 1859 The western portion of Oregon Territory was admitted to the US as the 33rd state, Oregon. The remainder was assigned to Washington Territory. ;1859 A boundary commission was set up to delineate the border between Vancouver Island and the Washington State coast. The commission could not come to agreement on where the middle of the Strait was so in 1859 things came to a head during the bloodless Pig War. 1861 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1861 ;January 29, 1861 The eastern portion of Kansas Territory was admitted as the 34th state, Kansas. The western portion was added to Colorado Territory on February 28, 1861, but for the month between statehood for Kansas and the formation of Colorado Territory, it appears to have had no official status. ;March 4, 1861 The Confederate States of America (CSA) was formed. The Southern states seceded at different dates and joined the CSA at different dates; to simplify the map, only the final form of the CSA is shown here. There were rebel governments as well as Union governments in Kentucky and Missouri, and the CSA had full control over Indian Territory. To view a detailed animated map depicting the various state secessions see CSA states evolution. ;February 28, 1861 Colorado Territory was organized, with land from Utah, New Mexico, and Nebraska Territories, as well as the land left over from Kansas Territory; it corresponded already to present-day Colorado. Also, the eastern tip of Washington Territory was transferred to Nebraska Territory. July 14, 1862 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1862 Due to its nature as a mining and grazing area, land started to be added to Nevada Territory to accommodate these activities. Its eastern border was moved eastward from the 39th meridian west from Washington, to the 38th meridian west from Washington, transferring the land from Utah Territory. 1863 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1863 ;April 29, 1863 The Mexican state of Campeche was split from Yucat√°n. ;February 24, 1863 The Union created its own Arizona Territory, splitting it off from New Mexico Territory, making both territories correspond to their present-day states, except for Arizona Territory including the southern tip of present-day Nevada. ;March 4, 1863 Idaho Territory was created from portions of Washington, Dakota, and Nebraska Territories, consisting of present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming. Nebraska and Washington Territories were left corresponding to their present-day counterparts. ;June 20, 1863 Several counties of northwestern Virginia who did not want to be part of the Confederacy split off and were admitted to the US as the 35th state, West Virginia. 1864 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1864 ;February 26, 1864 The Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n was re- split from Coahuila. ;May 26, 1864 Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, which also had some land transferred to Dakota Territory. Montana Territory corresponded to present-day Montana, Idaho Territory consisted of Idaho and western Wyoming, and Dakota Territory included both North and South Dakota, and most of Wyoming. ;October 31, 1864 Nevada Territory was admitted to the US as the 36th state, Nevada; it was a bit smaller than it is today, lacking area in both the east and south. 1865 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1865 ;April 9, 1865 The Confederate States of America surrendered. The process of Reconstruction and readmission to the union would take several years; to simplify the map, they are shown as already readmitted.

Also, the northwestern corner of Arizona Territory was transferred to the state of Nevada, giving it its present-day borders. ;March 1, 1867 Nebraska Territory was admitted to the US as the 37th state, Nebraska. ;July 1, 1867 Canada was formed from three provinces of British North America: the Province of Canada, which was split into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and the colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. At this time, though, Canada did not become independent according to the modern meaning of the word. The Statute of Westminster 1931 made Canada much closer to being independent, but not completely. ;October 11, 1867 The United States purchased Alaska from Russia; it was designated the Department of Alaska, and corresponds, except for a boundary dispute, to present-day Alaska. The United States Senate approved the purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7,200,000 (US$ in ) on April 9, 1867. 1868 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1868 ;July 25, 1868 Wyoming Territory was formed from portions of Dakota, Idaho, and Utah Territories, corresponding to the present-day borders of Wyoming. Idaho Territory then corresponds to present day Idaho, and Utah Territory to present-day Utah. 1869 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1869 ;January 15, 1869 The Mexican state of Hidalgo was split from the state of M√©xico. ;April 16, 1869 The Mexican state of Morelos was split from the state of M√©xico. July 15, 1870 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1870 The United Kingdom ceded most of its remaining land in North America to Canada, with Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory becoming the North-West Territories. The Rupert's Land Act 1868 transferred the region to Canada as of 1869, but it was only consummated in 1870 when ¬£300,000 were paid to the Hudson's Bay Company. At this time, the Manitoba Act took effect, and a small square of the newly acquired region surrounding the city of Winnipeg was made the province of Manitoba. Unlike what this map shows, the actual border between Newfoundland & Quebec is still unknown. Mapmakers have mostly made their own guesses until 1927, pretending that the border was more known than it really was. The problem didn't stop in 1927 (see 1927). July 20, 1871 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1871 The British colony of British Columbia joined Canada as the sixth province. British Columbia joined the Canadian confederation following The Great Confederation Debates in the spring of 1870 and the Confederation Negotiations of the following summer and winter. October 21, 1872 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1872 The San Juan Islands were awarded to the US, formally ending the Pig War with Britain. July 1, 1873 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1873 The British colony of Prince Edward Island joined Canada as the seventh province by an Act of Parliament (and, as part of the terms of union, was guaranteed a ferry link, a term which was deleted upon completion of the Confederation Bridge in 1997). July 26, 1874 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1874 The borders of Ontario were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed to eventually reach all the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas it was interested in were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north. 1876 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1876 ;April 12, 1876 The District of Keewatin was created by the passage of the Keewatin Act on April 12, 1876 in a central separate strip from the North-West Territories, in order to provide government for the growing area north of Manitoba and west of Ontario.Manitoba 1876, p. 3.Manitoba 1876, p. 1. ;August 1, 1876 Colorado Territory was admitted to the US as the 38th state, Colorado.

July 1, 1881 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1881 Manitoba's borders were expanded to a larger postage stamp province taking land easterly from the District of Keewatin to the western boundary of Ontario. Since the province's eastern border was defined as the \\"western boundary of Ontario\\", the exact definition of which was still unclear, Ontario disputed a portion of the new region. March 28, 1882 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America March 28, 1882 The part of Dakota Territory south of 43¬∞ north and north of the Keya Paha and Niobrara Rivers was transferred to Nebraska. 1884 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1884 ;June 21, 1884 The Islands of Perez Chica and Pajora of the Alacrene Islands in the bay of Campeche are claimed for the United States under the Guano Islands Act. ;December 12, 1884 The Mexican territory of Tepic was split from the state of Jalisco. May 7, 1886 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1886 The southwestern border of the District of Keewatin was adjusted to conform to the boundaries of the new provisional districts of the North-West Territories created in 1882, returning some land to the North-West Territories. The provisional districts were the District of Alberta, the District of Athabasca, District of Assiniboia and the District of Saskatchewan, which all remained administrative areas of the North-West Territories, unlike the District of Keewatin. 1889 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1889 ;November 2, 1889 Dakota Territory was split in two, and it was admitted to the US as the 39th state, North Dakota, and 40th state, South Dakota. ;November 8, 1889 Montana Territory was admitted to the US as the 41st state, Montana. ;November 11, 1889 Washington Territory was admitted to the US as the 42nd state, Washington. ;August 12, 1889 The dispute between Manitoba and Ontario ended as Ontario's borders were finalized in accordance with the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889, which extended the province west to the Lake of the Woods and north to the Albany River. 1890 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1890 ;May 2, 1890 Oklahoma Territory was organized from the western portion of Indian Territory, and included the Neutral Strip, corresponding to the western half of present-day Oklahoma. ;July 3, 1890 Idaho Territory was admitted to the US as the 43rd state, Idaho. ;July 10, 1890 Wyoming Territory was admitted to the US as the 44th state, Wyoming. November 24, 1894 The American claims over the Western Triangle, Areaas, Perez, Chica, Pajoras, and Arenas Keys are all waived by the American government in favor of Mexico.

The portion between the District of Keewatin, Ontario, and Hudson Bay was not in a district, and was assigned to the District of Keewatin by an Order of Council. Four additional provisional districts of the North-West Territories were formed, the District of Yukon, the District of Ungava, the District of Mackenzie, and the District of Franklin.Martin 1899, p. 223. 1896 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1896 ;January 4, 1896 Utah Territory was admitted to the US as the 45th state, Utah. ;May 4, 1896 A Supreme Court ruling officially assigns Greer County to Oklahoma Territory. 1897 The borders of the District of Keewatin were adjusted. Southampton Island, Coats Island, Mansel Island, Akimiski Island, and other islands were transferred to Keewatin. June 13, 1898 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1898 Yukon Territory was created from the District of Yukon in the northwestern part of the North-West Territories, and the Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898 expanded the borders of Quebec north to the Eastmain River. May 23, 1901 alt=Map showing Non- Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1901 The eastern border of Yukon Territory was adjusted to the eastern edge of the Peel River watershed, and also to include some more islands. November 24, 1902 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1902 The Mexican territory of Quintana Roo was split from the state of Yucat√°n. 1903 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1903 The Alaska Boundary Dispute was a territorial dispute between the United States and Canada (then a British Dominion with its foreign affairs controlled from London), and at a subnational level between Alaska on the US side and British Columbia and the Yukon on the Canadian side. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903, generally favoring the American claim. September 1, 1905 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1905 The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created from the North-West Territories. Saskatchewan's western border and Alberta's eastern border run concurrent with the 4th meridian or the 110¬∞W longitude. Saskatchewan's eastern border is not a meridian, but instead follows a staircase-shaped Dominion Land Survey range line. Alberta's southern and northern borders are the same as Saskatchewan's: the southern border is the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border or the 49th parallel and the northern border is the 60th parallel. Alberta's western border runs along peaks of the Rocky Mountain ridge and then extends north to the 60th parallel. The District of Keewatin became an administrative unit of the Northwest Territories. 1906 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1906 In 1906, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company performed an unauthorized diversion of the Rio Grande, which moved a tract of land, including the American village of Rio Rico, south of the river. Since the 1845 Border Treaty all land south of the Rio Grande was Mexican. Mexican authorities unknowingly assumed control of the area, which became known as the Horc√≥n Tract. 1907 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1907 ;September 26, 1907 The Dominion of Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907 (before which the territory had the status of a British colony, self- governing from 1855) to 1949. The Dominion of Newfoundland was situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast and comprised the island of Newfoundland and Labrador on the mainland. Newfoundland never became independent according to the modern meaning of the word. The Statute of Westminster 1931 would have made Newfoundland much closer to being independent, but not completely. However, the government of Newfoundland did not ratify it, and furthermore, abolished itself in 1934 because of bankruptcy. ;November 16, 1907 Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were combined and admitted to the US as the 46th state, Oklahoma. 1912 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1912 ;January 6, 1912 New Mexico Territory was admitted to the US as the 47th state, New Mexico. ;February 14, 1912 Arizona Territory was admitted to the US as the 48th state, Arizona. ;May 15, 1912 Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec were all expanded into their present-day boundaries. The Northwest Territories is now only situated north of the 60th parallel (except Hudson Bay and James Bay islands) with three districts, Keewatin, Mackenzie and Franklin. February 5, 1917 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1917 With the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico, the territory of Tepic had its name and status changed to the state of Nayarit. March 28, 1921 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America March 28, 1921 The dispute over a square mile between Delaware and Pennsylvania, The Wedge, is finally resolved in favor of Delaware. March 11, 1927 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1927 A decision of the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council of 1927 decided the issue of the border between the Dominion of Newfoundland and Canada in favour of Newfoundland. The issue had been the precise boundary between the Canadian province of Quebec and Labrador, part of Newfoundland. The boundary ruling clarified that a large area of the disputed land belonged to Newfoundland, not to Canada.Labrador Boundary Dispute Maps prior to 1927 wildly disagreed on the actual position of the border, instead of agreeing upon marking the area as being disputed. Maps after 1927 tended to agree with the decision, but due to protests, some mapmakers in Quebec still disagreed. In the 1960s, logos of the two biggest political parties of Quebec (PLQ & UN) both included the shape of the province as including all of Labrador. Disagreements persist even today (to a lesser extent), as Quebec insists on including the rest of the gulf's basin in its maps, separated with a dotted line saying 1927 border, non- final.http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/images/carte-2011/circonscriptions/745.gif Newfoundland complains in 2014, even though older electoral maps showed the same. 1928 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1928 Norway asserted its claim of sovereignty over the Sverdrup Islands. The islands are named after Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup, who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel Fram, although some were previously inhabited by Inuit people. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government showed no interest in pursuing the claim until 1928. At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the United Kingdom over the status of the Arctic island Jan Mayen and the Antarctic Bouvet Island. November 11, 1930 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1930 Sverdrup Islands are ceded to Canada by Norway, in exchange for British recognition of Norway's sovereignty over Jan Mayen. February 7, 1931 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1931 The Mexican Baja California Territory was split into North Territory of Baja California and South Territory of Baja California. Statute of Westminster 1931 allows dominions to become independent. Dominion of Canada decides to become almost independent, whereas Newfoundland does not sign (see 1934). 1934 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1934 The Dominion of Newfoundland, because of financial difficulties, was obliged to give up its self-governing status and the Commission of Government took its place. 1948 Air Force Island, Prince Charles Island, and Foley Island are discovered and added to Northwest Territories. March 31, 1949 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1949 The Dominion of Newfoundland and its dependency of Labrador joined Canada as the tenth province, named Newfoundland as proclaimed by the British North America Act 1949. November 21, 1952 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1952 The North Territory of Baja California changed its status and became the state of Baja California. 1959 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1959 ;January 3, 1959 Alaska Territory was admitted to the US as the 49th state, Alaska. 1970 alt=Map showing Non-Native American Nations Control over N America c. 1970 The city of Rio Rico, Texas, was ceded to Mexico in the Boundary Treaty of 1970.

The basic concept on which this approach rests is the idea that an important part of learning a language consists of being able to understand and produce lexical phrases as chunks. Students are taught to be able to perceive patterns of language (grammar) as well as have meaningful set uses of words at their disposal when they are taught in this way. In 2000, Norbert Schmitt, an American linguist and a Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, contributed to a learning theory supporting the lexical approach he stated that \\"the mind stores and processes these [lexical] chunks as individual wholes.\\" The short- term capacity of the brain is much more limited than long-term and so it is much more efficient for our brain to pull up a lexical chunk as if it were one piece of information as opposed to pulling up each word as separate pieces of information. In the lexical approach, instruction focuses on fixed expressions that occur frequently in dialogues, which Lewis claims make up a larger part of discourse than unique phrases and sentences. Vocabulary is prized over grammar per se in this approach. The teaching of chunks and set phrases has become common in English as a foreign or second language, though this is not necessarily primarily due to the Lexical Approach. This is because anywhere from 55-80% of native speakers' speech are derived from prefabricated phrases. Fluency could be considered unachievable if one did not learn prefabricated chunks or expressions. Common lexical chunks include: Have you ever ... been / seen / had / heard / tried Most language learners are accustomed to learning basic conversation starts, which are lexical chunks, including: \\"Good morning,\\" \\"How are you?\\" \\"Where is the restroom?\\" \\"Thank you,\\" \\"How much does this cost?\\" Language learners also use lexical chunks as templates or formulas to create new phrases: What are you doing? What are you saying? What are you cooking? What are you looking for? Syllabus The lexical syllabus is a form of the propositional paradigm that takes 'word' as the unit of analysis and content for syllabus design. Various vocabulary selection studies can be traced back to the 1920s and 1930s (West 1926; Ogden 1930; Faucet et al. 1936), and recent advances in techniques for the computer analysis of large databases of authentic text have helped to resuscitate this line of work. The modern lexical syllabus is discussed in Sinclair & Renouf (1988), who state that the main benefit of a lexical syllabus is that it emphasizes utility - the student learns that which is most valuable because it is most frequent. Related work on collocation is reported by Sinclair (1987) and Kennedy (1989), and the Collins COBUILD English Course (Willis & Willis 1988) is cited as an exemplary pedagogic implementation of the work, though \\"in fact, however, the COBUILD textbooks utilize one of the more complex hybrid syllabi in current ESL texts\\" (Long & Crookes 1993:23). Sinclair & Renouf (1988:155) find that (as with other synthetic syllabi), claims made for the lexical syllabus are not supported by evidence, and the assertion that the lexical syllabus is \\"an independent syllabus, unrelated by any principles to any methodology\\" (Sinclair et al. 1988:155) is subject to the criticism levelled by Brumfit against notional functional syllabi, i.e. that it (in this case, deliberately) takes no cognisance of how a second language is learned. Since these observations were made, however, Willis (1990) and Lewis (1993) have gone some way to provide such a theoretical justification.

With this book, Restrepo won the prestigious Premio Alfaguara de Novela in 2004. Natasha Wimmer's English translation was published in 2007. Plot summary Plot overview Delirium opens when its main protagonist, an ex-English professor turned traveling Purina salesman named Aguilar, discovers that while away on a four-day business trip his wife Agustina endured an experience that provoked a severe dissolution of her sanity. The book chronicles Aguilar's search for answers and his efforts to rehabilitate his young, beautiful and admittedly singular wife through the use of alternating narrative styles that, as the novel progresses, shed further light on the mysterious events that took place during Aguilar's absence as well as the nature of Agustina's family and childhood, both of which precipitated Agustina's struggle with mental illness. Delirium is organized and constructed through the utilization of a narrative pattern that proceeds in the following order: Aguilar, Midas (Agustina's ex- lover), Agustina, Aguilar, third-person narration of Nicholas and Blanca Portulinus (Agustina's grandparents). This pattern is repeated throughout the majority of the novel and helps to streamline and isolate the progression of several distinctly different, albeit entirely connected, storylines that are never eager to lend the reader immediate access to their secrets. Plot: in depth Delirium begins when Aguilar returns home from a weekend business trip to find several messages on his answering machine asking him to come pick his wife up at a hotel in downtown Bogot√°. Upon arriving at the hotel Aguilar finds Agustina in her room with a strange man, existing only as a bombed out shell of her former self. Once home Agustina remains incredibly distant, sometimes even hostile, too preoccupied with abnormal purification rituals and rantings about her dead father's impending visit, to the leave the apartment or even get dressed. Driven by his love for his wife, and aided by the unexpected arrival of Agustina's Aunt Sofi, Aguilar refuses to give up, however, and sets out to discover exactly what happened to Agustina. Aguilar cannot unravel the events of that weekend or resuscitate Agustina's sanity without help and thus he enlists the aid of an alluring hotel employee, named Anita, who lets Aguilar know that whoever his wife was with that weekend their behavior was in no way romantic and provides Aguilar with some of Agustina's belongings that she had left at the hotel. Even more integral to the success of Aguilar's investigation, however, is Aunt Sofi, who, in conjunction with Agustina's narratives about her childhood and the narrative depicting Nicholas Portulinus' own struggles with insanity, helps Aguilar to better understand Agustina's past, which helps to better explain her present behavior. The reader comes to discover Agustina's childhood was not a typical one. She grew up as the sole, attention-deprived daughter in an extremely wealthy Colombian family, the Londo√±os, and exhibited signs of mental instability (perhaps inherited from her grandfather who one night, when under the supervision of Agustina's mother, Eugenia, wandered off and drowned in a nearby river) even as a child. Agustina believed that she possessed visionary powers, powers that allowed her to see the future, and in her youth Agustina and her little brother, Bichi, would often perform rituals, often in an attempt to spare her brother from the wrath of her father who would physically and emotionally harass Bichi for his effeminate tendencies. The source of Agustina's power, as she believed, were several photographs that Bichi and her used secretly during their rituals; photographs that would later come to tear her family apart. Running parallel to the rest of the novel Midas' rags to riches to rags storyline tells the tale of Midas, a high class Aerobics Center owner and money launderer for Pablo Escobar, and his equally well to do and similarly employed friends (one of which happens to be Agustina's brother Joaco). Midas' story initially focuses upon a friendly, albeit high stakes, bet that Midas could organize a sexual situation to arouse his newly paralyzed and consequently impotent friend, Spider. Midas' story soon takes a turn for worse when Spider's thugs, while in the process of attempting to arouse Spider via the means of sadomasochism, inadvertently kill a prostitute (Sara Luz) in Midas' gym. The authorities are soon called into investigate and although they find nothing, Midas has covered his tracks well, he nonetheless feels the need to get away for a relaxing weekend, accepting an invitation from Joaco to come spend the weekend with the Londo√±o family (minus Carlos Vincente Sr. who has since died) at their estate in Sasaima. Once there, however, Midas realizes that, due in large part to her mother's insistence on skirting the truth, Agustina has begun to slip precariously towards her madness, a madness that Midas, being Agustina's former lover, knows all too well. Before the delirium is able to fully set in, however, Midas puts Agustina on the back of his motorcycle and rushes her away from both her family and her own deteriorating mind. Midas' heroism does not last long, though, for he soon hatches a plan to save his reputation that inadvertently plunges Agustina into her debilitating dementia. Soon, however, it becomes clear (due to the information that the other narratives grant) that Agustina is already well on her way to recovery. The novel concludes positively when Aguilar returns home one night to find a note written by Agustina. \\"Professor Aguilar\\", it reads \\"if you still love me despite everything, wear a red tie tomorrow.\\" Aguilar then, with a certain degree of romanticism, wakes up the next morning and dons the reddest tie he could find before heading down the stairs to breakfast. Characters *Aguilar: An ex-professor of literature and current Purina dog food salesman who is sixteen years older than his wife Agustina. *Agustina Londo√±o: A beautiful but unstable woman with a troubled, albeit, privileged past. *Nicholas Portulinus: Agustina¬¥s grandfather who, like Agustina, exhibited extensive symptoms of severe mental illness. Nicholas was a German transplant and a talented composer who perished in a drowning accident/suicide. *Blanca Portulinus: Nicholas' wife and Agustina's grandmother. Blanca was significantly younger than Nicholas when their relationship began via piano lessons and after his death developed denial skills that were inevitably transferred to her daughter Eugenia. *Carlos Vicente Londo√±o Sr.: Agustina's distant father and the uncontested ruler of the Londono household. Carlos had an affair with Aunt Sofi that eventually tore the Londo√±o family apart and precipitated the deterioration of Agustina's sanity. *Eugenia Londo√±o: Agustina's stoic mother whose inherited ability, and unwavering tendency, to manipulate the truth helps to exasperate Agustina's already fragile condition. *Joaco Londo√±o: Agustina's talented and masculine older brother who, like his mother, also possesses the innate ability to modify actuality in the name of convenience. *Carlos Vicente \\"Bichi\\" Londo√±o Jr: Agustina's younger brother who was subjected to the abuse of his father due to his homosexual tendencies. After a particularly brutal instance of this abuse Bichi, in an act of defiance, exposes the Londo√±o family‚Äôs darkest secret and leaves for Mexico with Aunt Sofi. *Aunt Sofi: Agustina's mysteriously pariah aunt who arrives unannounced to help Aguilar cope with Agustina's mental state. Aunt Sofi eventually proves invaluable in helping Aguilar to understand the nature of Agustina's trying past. *Midas McAlister: Agustina's ex lover and an expert money launderer, Midas worked his way up from very humble beginnings to become incredibly, if only temporarily, wealthy. Embroiled in a murder investigation crafts a plan to prove his innocence through the use Agustina's visionary powers which goes horribly awry. *Spider Salazar: Midas newly paralyzed friend who becomes the subject of a sexual bet that results in the death of a prostitute in Midas' gym. *Anita \\"The Fearless Girl\\": An alluring and somewhat rogue employee at the hotel where Aguilar found Agustina after her disastrous weekend. Aguilar later enlists her help to uncover some of the details of Agustina's mysterious stay at the hotel.  Historical Context  Delirium is set in Colombia's capital city of Bogota during the mid-1980s. This historical period was a turbulent one for Colombia seeing as its government, economy and people, had fallen under the influence of the Medellin Cartel who used murder and intimidation to control law enforcement officials, politicians and citizens. Led by Pablo Escobar and specializing in international drug trafficking the cartel helped Colombia to rise to the top of the world murder rate by 1985, which in turn prompted the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to commit nearly 362.4 million dollars a year to the eradication of the Medellin Cartel. Laura Restrepo sheds further light on this cultural instability when, in Delirium Aguilar and Anita hear and feel the bombing of a police station in downtown Bogot√° and later when Aguilar discusses how the road to Sasaima, where Agustina's family has a second home, cannot be driven in the late afternoon because at that point the army abandons their patrols and the guerillas come down from the mountains and assume control. Because of instances like this, as well as the novels preoccupation with the behavior and influence of Pablo Escobar, many have come to view Delirium as an illustration of Colombia's fragile, corrupted and war torn society and a commentary on the strain that an unstable culture can inflict on the sanity of its citizens.http://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm?book_number=1998 Major themes *Delirium *Pablo Escobar *Colombia *Illegal drug trade in Colombia *Colombia in popular culture *Homosexuality Critical reception Delirium, since its inception and eventual translation into English, has been reviewed and received quite well, although, not without fault. The following are excerpts taken from several reviews of Deliriumand a list of the awards it has earned. =Reviews= *\\"Delirium is a disconcertingly lovely book, and its depiction of Colombian society at an awful moment in its history (and a few awful times before) is sharp, vivid, utterly persuasive...But by the end it seems a fair description of Delirium which is both sweeter than you'd expect and less nourishing than you'd hope.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/books/review/Rafferty.t.html -The New York Times, Terrance Rafferty *\\"Saying that Laura Restrepo's writing is beautiful is kind of like saying that the Eiffel Tower is in Europe. Every word in Delirium is perfectly chosen, painfully honest, and brutally effective. Restrepo chooses her words like a poet, with infinite care. Even without her superb writing, though, Restrepo's novel would be excellent, her story intriguing and engrossing.\\"http://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm?book_number=1998 -The Philadelphia Inquirer *\\"Laura Restrepo breathes life into a singular amalgam of journalistic investigation and literary creation. Her fascination with popular culture and the play of her impeccable humor save her novels from any temptation toward pathos or melodrama, and infuse them with unmistakable reading pleasures.\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385519908 -Gabriel Garcia Marquez *\\"Laura Restrepo's Delirium is a book-and-a-half: stunning, dense, complex, mind-blowing. This novel goes far above politics, right up into high art.\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385519908 -The Washington Post *\\"Delirium is one of the finest novels written in recent memory. Restrepo has a total mastery over what she writes, an astonishing but absolute mastery. Yes, there‚Äôs violence, narcotraffic, madness, perhaps even love itself as a form of total madness. The important thing is that we‚Äôre talking about a truly great novel, of a kind that you seldom encounter anymore.\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385519908 -Jose Saramago =Awards= *Alfaguara Prize (2004)http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385519908 *Grinzane Cavour Prize (2006)http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385519908 References Colombian novels ","title":"Delirium (Restrepo novel)"},{"id":"25074947","text":"Ulpian Fulwell (1545/6 ‚Äì before 1586) was an English Renaissance theatre playwright, satirist and poet. Later as a Gloucestershire parish priest, he appears to have neglected his duties. Church, stage and satire Born one of the two sons of a linen draper in Wells, Somerset, Thomas Fulwell (died 1563), and his wife Christabel (n√©e James, died 1584), he was ordained priest in 1566. In 1572 he married Eleanor Warde, who died in 1577. In 1578 he was remarried to Marie Whorwood, by whom he had six children. Only in 1578 did he manage to matriculate at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he apparently graduated, as he was termed a master of arts in 1584. Fulwell became Rector of Naunton, near Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, in 1570, but appears to have been lax. It was noted at an episcopal visitation in 1572 that the church was in decay. Four years later he was fined because his clerk was found to be illiterate and local parents had ceased to send their children to catechism classes. All of Fulwell's own six children were baptised in Naunton, one of whom died in 1585. Fulwell himself was probably dead by 1586, when another man, Joseph Hanxman, was recorded as Rector of Naunton.Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 22 November 2017. Fulwell's neglect of his parish and education may have been due to the attention he paid to his literary work. His first, Like Will to Like, Quod the Devil to the Collier (after 1566, first printed 1568), was one of several morality plays reliant on proverbs that appeared at that time. This play has been analysed in a study as exploring the themes of morality and vices in relation to the devil. It has also been credited with influencing a later play, Grim the Collier of Croydon, acted by Pembroke's Men at Henslowe's Rose Theatre on 28 October 1600.E. K. Chambers: The Elizabethan Stage (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923) Vol. 3, p. 317. The Fulwell play was revived in 1968 and 1988 by the Poculi Ludique Societas of Toronto, Canada.Retrieved 4 October 2017. In 1575 Fulwell published a pro-Tudor piece of writing, The Flower of Fame dedicated to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. This was followed in 1576 by Ars adulandi, or, The Art of Flattery, a group of eight satires dedicated to Mildred, Lady Burghley. The criticisms were stringent enough for him to be ordered by the courts to make a recantation on 7 July 1576 before Gilbert Berkeley, Bishop of Bath and Wells. A revised edition appeared in 1579.

First formed in 1919 during the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force, the battalion was an amalgamation of two other units, the 55th and 53rd Battalions. It was disbanded shortly afterwards and remained off the order of battle until 1937 when it was raised as a part-time unit of the Militia, based in Sydney. In 1941, with the expansion of the Australian Army in response to the growing threat of war in the Pacific, the battalion was split and the 55th and 53rd Battalions reformed separately. In late 1942, however, they were amalgamated once more and together went on to participate in the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea and on Bougainville. History The 55th/53rd Battalion was formed briefly in 1919 in Belgium following the cessation of hostilities through the amalgamation of the 55th and 53rd Battalions as men were transferred out of these units as part of the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force. As this process reached completion, however, the battalion was disbanded shortly afterwards. In 1921, both the 55th and 53rd Battalions were re-raised as part of the Citizen Forces, in the Sydney, region part of a reorganisation of Australia's part-time military forces. The economic hardships of the 1930s and the suspension of the compulsory training scheme meant that training opportunities were limited during this time and there were few volunteers. As a result, a number of battalions were amalgamated as numbers dropped.. The 55th and 53rd remained on the order of battle as separate units until 1937 when they were amalgamated once more, adopting the combined territorial designation of the \\"New South Wales Rifle/West Sydney Regiment\\". Following the outbreak of World War II, they remained in existence until October 1941 when the 55th and 53rd were delinked once more and the two battalions took part in the Kokoda Track campaign separately. During this time the 55th had developed a good reputation for itself, however, the 53rd had been poorly prepared for the desperate situation that the Australians were facing around Kokoda and it had not performed so well. In October 1942 it was decided to re-amalgamate the 55th and 53rd and the 55th/53rd was reformed. Attached to the 30th Brigade, it went on to successfully take part in the fighting around Sanananda in 1942‚Äì43. In early December 1942, the 55th/53rd were sent to the Sanananda Track, having marched from Popondetta. On 7 December the battalion dispatched a single company, 'B' Company, to launch a diversionary attack, while the rest of the battalion supported the 49th Battalion's attack at Sanananda. Coming up against strong defensive positions, the Australians were beaten back and the 55th/53rd suffered 130 casualties. For the next week they probed the Japanese perimeter before launching a second attack on 19 December, which saw them suffer a further 108 casualties. Further probes were undertaken until 26 December when the 55th/53rd - now a part of the 14th Brigade. - followed up an unsuccessful attack by the 36th Battalion. Early the following month, the battalion was moved back to Gona, where they remained until they were returned to Australia in March 1943 on the troopship Duntroon. Landing in Cairns, Queensland, the battalion was sent to Ravenshoe for leave before reforming around Townsville in April. While there, the 55th/53rd were transferred first to the 12th and then the 3rd Brigade, with whom it undertook garrison duty around Townsville. It was later transferred to the 11th Brigade and, despite being a Militia battalion, it eventually achieved AIF status, which meant that it could be deployed to fight in any theatre of war.. In December 1944, the battalion was sent to Boungainville where it took part in the fighting throughout 1945 as part of the 11th Brigade. During this time it undertook patrol operations in the Central and Northern Sectors of the island and although it experienced several contacts with the Japanese, it fought no major battles against them before it was withdrawn to the main Australian base around Torokina in May, where it remained until the war came to an end. It was during the period of demobilisation that Francis Donovan served as the battalion's adjutant. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945 they undertook garrison duties in Rabaul until mid-1946, when the battalion was repatriated to Australia and disbanded. During its involvement in the war, the battalion lost 135 men killed or died of wounds, and 197 wounded. Men from the 55th/53rd received the following decorations: one Military Cross, one Distinguished Conduct Medal, four Military Medals and 12 Mentions in Despatches.

It was introduced in 1998 by the World Kindness Movement, a coalition of nations' kindness NGOs. It is observed in many countries, including Canada, Australia, Nigeria and United Arab Emirates. Singapore observed the day for the first time in 2009. Italy and India also observed the day. In the UK, it is fronted by David Jamilly, who co-founded Kindness Day UK with Louise Burfitt-Dons. In 2010, at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012, at the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon Peter Garrett provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and Life Vest Inside In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, Marie Bashir, Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at Government House to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3 & 4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by Orly Wahba from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in New York City. Canada celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow flowers were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in Slovenia, organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarƒçek as part of their project Randomised Kindness. Objective World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the human condition which bridges the divides of race, religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the United Nations by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

Test procedure To perform the test, the examiner grasps the wrist with their thumb over the scaphoid tubercle (volar aspect of the palm) in order to prevent the scaphoid from moving into its more vertically oriented position in radial deviation. For the test, the wrist needs to be in slight extension. The patient's wrist is then moved from ulnar to radial deviation. The examiner will feel a significant 'clunk' and the patient will experience pain if the test is positive. For completeness, the test must be performed on both wrists for comparison. If the scapholunate ligament is disrupted, the scaphoid will subluxate over the dorsal lip of the distal radius. Original Description by Watson: > \\"The patient is approached by the examiner as if to engage in arm wrestling, > face to face across a table with diagonally opposed hands raised (right to > right or left to left) and elbows resting on the surface in between. With > the patient's forearm slightly pronated, the examiner grasps the wrist from > the radial side, placing his thumb on the scaphoid tuberosity (as if pushing > a button to open a car door) and wrapping his fingers around the distal > radius. The examiner's other hand grasps at the metacarpal level, > controlling the wrist position. Starting in ulnar deviation and slight > extension, the wrist is moved radially and slightly flexed with constant > thumb pressure on the scaphoid. This radial deviation causes the scaphoid to > flex. The examiners thumb pressure opposes this normal rotation, causing the > scaphoid to shift in relation to the other bones of the carpus. This > scaphoid shift may be subtle or dramatic. A truly positive test requires > both pain on the back of the wrist (not just where you are pressing on the > scaphoid tuberosity), and comparison with the opposite wrist is essential.\\" Uses Watson's test is used by physicians to diagnose scapholunate instability. This test has a low specificity and sometimes is positive for capito-lunate instability. As many as 20% of normal wrists will also have a 'clunk'.

It fought mostly in the mountainous area that today encompasses the border regions of Virginia and West Virginia, and was part of Jubal Early's Army of the Valley during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Companies and formation Companies of militia in southwest Virginia began to form as soon as secession occurred on April 17, 1861. Ex-governor John B. Floyd was made a brigadier general and asked to organize these militia into a fighting force. Floyd called the militia to assemble at the central railroad hub of Wytheville and appointed West Point graduate Henry Heth to drill and organize the volunteers. By May 29, Heth had formed ten companies of roughly 900 men into a fighting unit and it was mustered in as the 45th Virginia. The original ten companies were:Scott, pp. 2‚Äì3 # Company A ‚Äì Floyd Guard (Tazewell Co.), under Captain Joseph Harrison # Company B ‚Äì Mount Airy Rough and Readys (Wythe Co.), under Captain John Buchanan # Company C ‚Äì Grayson Rifles (Grayson Co.), under Captain Alexander M. Davis # Company D ‚Äì Minute Men (Wythe Co.), under Captain Robert H. Gleaves # Company E ‚Äì Rough and Readys (Carroll Co.), under Captain William Lundy # Company F ‚Äì Sharpshooters (Bland Co.), under Captain Andrew J. Grayson # Company G ‚Äì West Augusta Rifles (Tazewell Co.), under Captain William H. Browne # Company H ‚Äì Tazewell Rangers (Tazewell Co.), under Captain Edwin H. Harman # Company I ‚Äì Reed Island Rifles (Carroll Co.), under Captain Thomas D. Bolt # Company K ‚Äì Tazewell Boys(Tazewell Co.), under Captain Titus V. Williams On June 17, Heth was promoted to colonel and made commander of the regiment. Born in Tidewater Virginia, Heth was unpopular with the mountain farmers and was known as a strict disciplinarian. In turn, Heth was frustrated by the illiteracy and lack of discipline of his men, as well as General Floyd's actions as commanding officer. He wrote of Floyd, \\"I soon discovered that my chief was as incapacitated for the work he had undertaken as I would have been to lead an Italian opera.\\"Heth, p. 152 The regiment also elected Gabriel Colvin Wharton, a Virginia Military Institute graduate from Culpeper as major, but within a month he was made a colonel, in command of the 51st Virginia Infantry. Western Virginia Campaign of 1861 In August, Floyd decided to move his brigade (the 45th Virginia and the 50th Virginia) into the Kanawha Valley in present-day West Virginia, possibly because of the recent retreat of his political rival, former governor and Confederate brigadier general Henry A. Wise from the same territory. Throughout the month he moved his two regiments north slowly, until they were eventually joined by two more from Wise's brigade, the 22nd and 36th Virginia.Scott, pp. 6‚Äì7 On August 25, scouts reported the 7th Ohio Infantry in camp at Cross Lanes https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/wv004.htm and Floyd, after asking Heth's advice, ordered an attack. The 45th Virginia lost its first man killed in battle, but the brigade easily routed the Ohio soldiers. Floyd made camp at Carnifex Ferry and remained there until September 10, when a Union brigade under Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans arrived and drove off Floyd's brigade in the Battle of Carnifex Ferry.Heth, p. xxxiv During the battle, Floyd was wounded in the arm and treated by a surgeon of the regiment. The 45th Virginia lost no men in the battle, but suffered three casualties while retreating towards Dogwood Gap.Scott, p. 8 Floyd and Wise met up at Dogwood Gap and together withdrew to Sewell Mountain in Fayette County, where the 45th Virginia received a new company out of Tazewell County, Company L. Floyd decided to fall back about 40 miles southeast to what he believed was a more defensible positionO.R. Volume V, Chapter XIV pp. 900‚Äì902 and ordered Wise to do so as well, but Wise refused and mocked Floyd as he had been mocked in August. On September 21, Gen. Robert E. Lee arrived at the orders of President Jefferson Davis to take command of forces in the Kanawha Valley region. Lee determined that Wise had been correct, and ordered Floyd's brigade back to Sewell Mountain, but also unified the command under Floyd and sent Wise to Richmond for assignment.Scott, p. 10 Throughout September and October, the brigade maneuvered around the area in several abortive attempts at an attack on Rosecrans' retreating men. Lee was recalled east October 30, leaving sole command to Floyd, who was becoming more unpopular. Several officers of the 45th Virginia resigned over harsh treatment of their men, and Floyd angrily replaced them, including Captains Joseph Harrison, Alexander Davis, and George Gose. In November, Floyd began shelling Rosecrans' position, but did not order an attack and, when Rosecrans began an offensive of his own on November 10 was forced to retreat on roads made miserable by bad weather. He retreated all the way to Dublin in by December 9 before halting and entering winter quarters.Scott, p. 12 In December, the 45th Virginia became part of a new brigade that was placed under Heth, who was based in Lewisburg and Lt. Col. William E. Peters took charge of the regiment. January was the end of the regiment's enlistment, and the men were promised $500 and a chance to elect new officers if they signed on for another three-year term. Despite only suffering 4 killed in battle and 70 killed by disease, there was much less enthusiasm than in the previous year. Campaigns of 1862 In January, most of the regiment re-enlisted, and Company L was transferred to the 23rd Virginia Infantry. Floyd and most of his command was transferred to Tennessee to support the activities of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, and the 45th Virginia spent the next several months maneuvering. In April, Lee, now special military adviser to the President, ordered the regiment to Knoxville, but Brig. Gen. Heth convinced him that it was more vital to guard rail lines in southwest Virginia. On April 30, the 45th Virginia was asked to quickly counter Union movements by Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox in Giles County. On May 10, Heth led a small brigade, including the 45th Virginia, against the 23rd Ohio, now under the command of Lt. Col. Rutherford B. Hayes at Giles Court House, driving them out of their position. Heth praised the leadership of Peters, but when the regiment was finally reorganized four days later, Peters was not elected and left the regiment.Scott, pp. 15‚Äì19 Tazewell native William Browne, a West Point graduate and commander of Company G, was elected colonel, and another Tazewell native, Edwin Houston Harman, was elected lieutenant colonel. Alexander Davis became the new major, and the men also took the opportunity to replace five of the ten company commanders, plus the two who had been promoted, as well as many of the lieutenants.Scott, pp. 19‚Äì20 Heth received word that Col. George Crook had occupied Lewisburg and took the 45th and 22nd Virginia and Finney's Battalion to drive them off. Heth mismanaged his affair, and Crook easily defeated the attack, with only the 45th Virginia maintaining some order. He spent the rest of the summer withdrawing, much to the anger of local residents, until he was transferred to Tennessee and replaced by Brig. Gen. John Echols, a Virginia Military Institute graduate. Maj. Gen. William W. Loring, who had command of the Department of Southwestern Virginia that the 45th Virginia was operating within, decided to unite his forces in order to drive the Union troops from the Kanawha Valley. At 5 am on September 10, Loring deployed his forces on the approach to the Union camp at Fayetteville, with the 45th Virginia on the left reassigned to the brigade of Brig. Gen. John S. Williams. They advanced through heavy fire, Browne writing, ‚Äúthe enemy threw grape and minie-balls thick as hail around us,‚Äù until nightfall stopped the brigade. The Union withdrew during the night and began a nearly week-long pursuit to Charleston. The Confederates reached the city in the midst of a Union retreat.O.R. Volume XIX, Chapter XXXI, Part I, pp. 1085‚Äì1086 Lt. James Hackler and three other men from Company C crossed the river while the town was still half-occupied and hauled down the garrison‚Äôs colors, returning with them over the river safely.O.R. Volume XIX, Chapter XXXI, Part I, p. 1084 With the conclusion of the Battle of Charleston, Loring had effectively cleared all Union troops from the Kanawha Valley and issued a proclamation saying, \\"The army of the Confederate states has come upon you to expel the enemy, to rescue the people from despotism of the counterfeit State government imposed on you by Northern bayonets, and to restore the country once more to its natural allegiance to the State.\\" Loring also called on the western counties to cease all cooperation with the Northern armies and to send men for new regiments for his own.O.R. Volume XIX, Chapter XXXI, Part I, p. 1072 The occupation of Charleston was short-lived, though. Lee's defeat at the Battle of Antietam led him to order Loring to the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce him in case Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan pursued the Army of Northern Virginia across the Potomac River. Loring chose to remain in Charleston instead and was summoned to Richmond, where he began marching with his entire army. On October 16, he was summoned again, but this time was also relieved of command, with Echols replacing him temporarily. Echols tried to move the army back to Charleston, but Union forces had already made the position untenable, so he placed the army into winter quarters on a line from Lewisburg to Princeton.Scott, p. 25 In November, the 45th Virginia's brigade commander, John S. Williams, was made the new head of the Department of Southwestern Virginia to replace Loring, and it was subordinated to the new Trans-Allegheny Department covering all of western Virginia to the Kentucky border, which Williams also commanded temporarily, until Davis settled on Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones.Eicher, pp. 882‚Äì884. 1863: Defending the Railroad and the Salt Mines By the winter of 1863, the salt mines of Saltville, Virginia, had become of vital importance to Confederate forces in Virginia. Most of the salt used in preserving meat for the armies came from southwestern Virginia and the Department of the Trans- Allegheny generally, and the 45th Virginia specifically, were charged with protecting the supply. Throughout the winter, the regiment engaged in a series of periodic maneuvers designed to support an offensive that never occurred. Mostly, the regiment moved from town to town, even taking the time to rebuild the home of a local man whose house was destroyed by a windstorm.Scott, p. 26. Summer brought the admission of the state of West Virginia into the Union, as well as Brig. Gen. William W. Averell to southwestern Virginia and a renewed Union offensive. Averell launched another offensive towards Lewisburg and the Confederate government became concerned about the law library containing the deeds to all the land in western counties of Virginia, recently declared as a new state of West Virginia. Troops from the Trans-Allegheny Department, now under Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones, were asked to protect Lewisburg. A brigade under Col. William L. Jackson attempted to slow Averell and the 45th Virginia, camped in Lewisburg, attempted to come up on his rear. When Jackson was forced to fall back, Jones sent the 22nd Virginia under Col. George S. Patton and the 26th Virginia Battalion and together, with a handful of other troops, they confronted Averell at White Sulphur Springs on August 26. Two companies detached from the 45th Virginia under Lt. Col. Harman entered the fight on the left \\"fighting like demons,\\" in his words. As Averell added troops against them Col. Browne sent companies to reinforce and, finally, Maj. Davis brought the rest of the regiment.Scott, p. 30 After Averell's troops had made four charges on his men, Harman wrote: > After they had charged our regt four different times ‚Äì and had been repulsed > ‚Äì the next time they came through the brush and go up to within 20 paces > before we saw them ‚Äì and the officers hollowed to us ‚Äì damn you ‚Äì aint you > Rebels going to run ‚Äì one of my fellows ‚Äì replied ‚Äì no damn you we aint and > then we give them such a terrific fire they could not withstand it and ran > themselves. Our regt repulsed eight heavy and furious charges.Scott, p. 30 The fighting continued until nightfall, when both armies slept on the field. The next morning, Averell ordered one more charge and was again repulsed. For their stand at White Sulphur Springs, the men of the 45th Virginia won praise from Jones, who wrote in his report that they had \\"inscribed their names high on the roll of those who in this war have illustrated the valor of our troops.\\"O.R., Volume XXIX, Chapter XLI, p. 46 Col Browne also commented that \\"notwithstanding long marches my men had made (having marched about 100 miles during the four days preceding this engagement), I had no stragglers or skulkers. I have never on any battle-field seen men act cooler or braver; they fought with a determination to do or die.\\"O.R., Volume XXIX, Chapter XLI, p. 62-64 With the Confederate forces in Tennessee under heavy pressure as the Union approached Chickamauga during September, the 45th Virginia and much of Jones' command was transferred to East Tennessee. Initially, the regiment was ordered to remain to defend Saltville and the mines while its division went west, but on September 19 the battle at Chickamauga spurred Confederate war planners to order them to Tennessee as well.Scott, p. 31 Jones began a series of maneuvers and skirmishes around the Wautauga River against the Army of the Ohio under Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. But when Burnside fell back on Knoxville by mid-October, Jones decided to return the 45th Virginia to Saltville, while the rest of the command joined in the campaign of James Longstreet to lay siege to the Army of the Ohio.Scott, pp. 31‚Äì32 The regiment had already settled into winter quarters when a raid by Averell into the New River Valley threatened the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad again. December 16, the 45th Virginia set out for New River Bridge, then spent Christmas Day in the town of Salem, before the threat was ended and it returned to Saltville and winter quarters. On the final day of 1863, 918 men were listed on the roll as members of the regiment, 702 of whom were present, the rest presumably on sick leave or furlough.Scott, p.33 The 1864 Campaign in the Shenandoah Valley See: Valley Campaigns of 1864 =Crook and Averell's Raids= The regiment remained around Saltville through the winter, with many of the men reenlisting for the duration of the war. By early March, there was a debate as to whether the regiment belonged to Longstreet's command in East Tennessee with the rest of its brigade, or remained in the Department of Trans-Allegheny under its new head, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge. It was decided for the latter. On the final day of April, roll shows that the regiment had 840 present.Scott, 35. By spring, the Union's new General-in-chief Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant launched a new strategy for the war that coordinated action in all theaters. In southwestern Virginia and West Virginia, this meant Averell would move against Saltville and Wytheville, where substantial lead mines existed, and Brig. Gen. George Crook would cut the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad in New River Gorge. Then they would meet up with Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel, who was advancing on the Shenandoah Valley, at Lynchburg and march on to Richmond. While John Hunt Morgan dealt with Averell, the 45th Virginia was hurried west to confront Crook. Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins brigade of cavalry had halted Crook at Cloyd's Mountain and the 45th Virginia joined them there. Col. Browne spread out his companies on the Confederate left and faced the brunt of Crook's infantry, a brigade of Ohioans under the regiment's old opponent Rutherford B. Hayes, including the 23rd Ohio. Lt. Col. Harman, in command of that portion of the line, sent Major Davis for reinforcements from the 60th Virginia, who sent two companies, but while he was placing them he was struck by a musket ball and mortally wounded. The Union soldiers were pushed back, but when the Confederates pursued them, they turned the tables and the Confederates began to run. Davis tried to stabilize the line, but intense hand-to-hand combat broke out and the flank as turned. Jenkins himself was hit in the arm while at the head of the 45th Virginia and carried form the battle field, mortally wounded, and cavalry Col. John McCausland assumed command. He ordered a full retreat that left much of the regiment's supply train on the field, along with 46 of its men that were captured, along with 96 wounded, and 26 killed, its worst casualties so far.O.R., Volume XXXVII, Chapter XLIX, pp. 52‚Äì53 Crook, however, did not pursue, having heard of the heavy losses taken by the Army of the Potomac in the Wilderness north of Richmond, as well as the defeat of Sigel at the New Market. McCausland moved his army back into the territory, and a number of the men of the 45th Virginia became responsible for burying the dead on the Cloyd's Mountain battlefield on May 18. As the campaign north of Richmond became bloodier, Breckinridge was called to Richmond with a division of his command, and Brig. Gen. William \\"Grumble\\" Jones took over the remainder of the department. Sigel was replaced by Maj. Gen. David Hunter, with instructions to destroy Confederate property in the Shenandoah Valley, in order to deprive Lee's Army of Northern Virginia of supplies, particularly food.Scott, p. 40 =The Lynchburg Campaign= Jones brought his troops north, into the Valley to stop Hunter, who had already burned Lexington. The 45th Virginia and the rest of Jones' men were transported by rail to Port Republic, but when Hunter did not appear began marching towards Staunton. On June 5, the two armies encountered each other at the village of Piedmont. The 45th Virginia took up position behind rail pens and endured a heavy Union artillery barrage. Hunter moved several regiments around the Confederate right flank under cover of woods, which Jones discovered too late. While trying to rally his men, he was struck in the head and killed.Scott, pp. 40‚Äì41 The Confederates were routed, with heavy losses. The 45th Virginia suffered at least 325 men captured, dozens wounded, and six killed, though the poorly kept records almost certainly underestimate losses for the battle. Col. Browne was wounded and captured. A West Point classmate, Capt. Henry A. du Pont visited him in the hospital and loaned him some money for his imprisonment, but three days later his wounds took a bad turn and he died suddenly. Alexander Davis was also captured, along with three company commanders and two more were seriously wounded. The regiment also lost its colors, when they were seized by Pvt Thomas Evans, a Welsh immigrant in the 54th Pennsylvania, who would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The men slowly regrouped at Waynesboro with fewer than 300 remaining.Scott, p. 45 The regiment fell back to Lynchburg, now being led by the commander of Company E, the recently promoted Major Francis Miller, a Prussian immigrant who began the war as the regiment's commissary sergeant. In Lynchburg, they joined with Breckinridge, who had been returned to western Virginia to fight Hunter, who was advancing on Lynchburg with a sizable army. McCausland's cavalry managed to delay Hunter long enough for reinforcements to arrive from Lee under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, who moved box cars back and forth loudly and successfully fooled Hunter into retreating.Scott, pp. 42‚Äì43 =Marching with Early= Early quickly reformed the troops at Lynchburg into the Army of the Valley and planned an offensive campaign to take pressure off of Lee. The 45th Virginia was placed in the brigade of their former major, Gabriel Wharton, now a brigadier general. The regiments march with Early down the Valley to Shepherdstown was its first with a unit larger than a brigade, and it crossed the Potomac River on July 5. Four days later, on July 9, Early fought a battle against a hodge-podge force of Union defenders under Lew Wallace at Monocacy Junction, but Wharton's brigade was held in reserve and saw no action.Scott, p. 44 By July 11, the men of the 45th Virginia could see the recently completed dome of the United States Capitol building from their position in Silver Spring. It was not involved in the fighting near Fort Stevens, though, and on July 13, Wharton's brigade began clearing Union troops to the army's rear as it fell back to the Potomac, including at Heaton's Crossroads and Cool Spring.Scott, p. 45 Throughout the retreat, Crook had been shadowing Early's movement to the west, but on July 24, Early suddenly attacked him at Kernstown. As part of Wharton's brigade, the 45th Virginia turned Crook's left flank and routed his army. The move freed John McCausland's cavalry to return Maryland, where he attempted to hold the city of Chambersburg ransom. When his price of $500,000 was not met, he ordered Col. William Peters ‚Äì erstwhile commander of the 45th Virginia, now leading the 21st Virginia Cavalry ‚Äì to burn the city. When he refused, he was arrested and McCausland set the city ablaze. \\"Remember Chambersburg\\" became a rallying cry for Northern troops. Early remained in the lower Valley into August, when Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan was put in command of all Union forces with orders to eliminate Early. Breckinridge had been transferred out of the theater again and Wharton assumed command of the division, with his brigade led by Col. Augustus Forsberg of the 51st Virginia. Over the next two weeks, Early and Sheridan took turns pursuing each other up and down the Valley, and the Confederates were reinforced by a division under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson. Wharton's division led the pursuit of the Union back to Winchester, capturing about 200.Scott, pp. 46‚Äì47 The 45th Virginia was held in reserve with the rest of Wharton's Division during the Battle of Summit Point on August 21. The pursuit and counter-pursuit continued. On September 4, Wharton was ordered to Berryville and found Anderson's men engaged with the division of Joseph Thoburn of Sheridan's army. The 45th Virginia and the rest of the division took up a position on Anderson's left flank and secured it, while the Confederates drove off Thoburn's men. But during the battle, Sheridan had been able to draw up the rest of his army, so Early ordered the Southerners to take up a position on Opequon Creek south of Winchester.Scott, pp. 47‚Äì48 During August, Lee had lost control of the Weldon Railroad south of Petersburg as Grant extended his lines to the west. Anderson was ordered back to Petersburg with his men and Wharton's division was moved north of Winchester to defend the battery that would cover the movement on September 16. Sheridan ordered an all-out assault and caught Wharton's division well north of the town at 8:00 am. Around 11:00, cavalry under Brig. Gen. George A. Custer penetrated the line, but the Confederates eventually drove him back.Scott, p. 48 The division was withdrawn to about a mile north of Winchester, to link up with the rest of Early's line, with the 45th Virginia's brigade on the extreme left flank. Wharton's division was the focal point of a charge by Thoburn's division of Crook's army, which the 45th Virginia and its division turned back with heavy casualties. Thoburn reorganized and kept up the assaults and was joined by Averell's cavalry, who managed to get behind Forsberg's brigade. The division broke, followed by the army, and the men of the 45th Virginia ran back through town while Averell's cavalry rounded up prisoners. At least five members of the regiment were killed and 79 were captured.Scott, pp. 49‚Äì50 Early drew a new battle line a few miles south at Fisher's Hill, with Wharton's division entrenched at the top, Forsberg's brigade connecting to the division of John B. Gordon. The division held off the larger Union division attacking it, but once again Thoburn's division along with the division of Rutherford Hayes turned the Confederate left flank and the army was routed. Wharton's men were able to form a rear guard and most of the army escaped up the Valley. Sheridan began a campaign to destroy everything that could be of use to the Confederate army.Scott, p. 50 Early took the opportunity to advance back down the Valley. By October 1, the army had reached Mount Sidney. In Forsberg's Brigade, only 417 men were listed present for duty, with probably fewer than 200 in the 45th Virginia. Sheridan, thinking that the Confederates in the Valley were no longer a threat, began withdrawing towards Winchester. The Confederates surprised Union troops camped near Hupp's Hill on October 13, and then took up defensive positions on Fisher's Hill, alerting Sheridan to the danger and leading him to order his full army of 30,000 to Cedar Creek.Scott, pp. 50‚Äì51 Before dawn on October 19, Early put his small army into position to attack, surprising the sleeping Union army, with Sheridan not present. The 45th Virginia, their brigade now being led by Captain R.H. Logan, advanced on the extreme left with the division and swept the Union men in front of them from the field. Wharton's division was moved to the right, with the 45th Virginia's brigade again on the extreme flank. The starving division became caught up gorging themselves on Union supplies captured in Middleburg and soon the looting spread to the whole army. But the Union army was not yet routed, and Sheridan arrived on the battlefield, reorganizing his army. The Union crashed into Early's left, and the whole Southern army took flight, leaving the captured supplies and many of their own, too.Scott, p. 51 The army camped for several weeks at New Market and the 45th Virginia received 44 new conscripts from Richmond, mostly over the age of 45. Again, Sheridan withdrew north, and again Early followed him, but the army was too weakened to directly challenge the Union army and eventually returned to New Market. With the arrival of cold weather and no winter clothes or shoes, the 45th Virginia refused to drill in the snow on December 6 and was placed under arrest by the 51st Virginia at Wharton's orders with Captain Rufus Wainwright temporarily taking command of the regiment. By December 16, Wharton's Division was all that remained of Early's command, the rest having been returned to Lee's army in Petersburg. Over the final weeks of the year, they were marched out of camp in heavy snow to meet several Union advances, but no fighting took place.Scott, p.53 The End of the War and Disbandment The first two months of 1865 passed without incident and on March 2, Wharton's Division and some remaining troops in southwestern Virginia now under Early's command was ordered to move east to support Lee's army. They got as far as Waynesboro, trailed by Custer's cavalry, before forming a line of battle to repulse the Union. Wharton's 800 men were quickly surrounded by the 7,500 Union cavalry and surrendered, though Wharton and Early both escaped. Some of the men of the 45th Virginia managed to escape as well, but Major Miller and 119 of the men were captured. Those that got away regrouped at Charlottesville and were soon transferred back to Dublin by rail, and marched form there to Christiansburg, where, upon hearing the news of Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, they decided to disband.Scott, pp. 53‚Äì54 Over the course of the war 1,947 men were listed as members of the 45th Virginia at some point during the war, though most of the regiment's records were poorly kept or not preserved, so it is unclear how many were considered true members of the regiment. Union prisoner of war records shows 600 members of the regiment as having been captured, 104 of whom died in captivity. The regiment's records show 65 deaths in battle and 143 deaths from disease or other reasons, some of which may be from wounds.Scott, p. 54 See also *List of Virginia Civil War units Notes References * Eicher, John H. and David J.

International Campaign for Human Rights In Iran 15 October 2008 The Supreme Court of Iran confirmed his death sentence on July 17, 2007, but it was reversed by the Head of the Judiciary on 3 September 2008 who sent it back to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj for review. According to his lawyer, Sirvan Houshmand, \\"the legal case against Hassanpour rests purely on evidence from interrogation reports obtained during his detention,\\" lacking any other corroborating evidence, and interrogators in Iranian prisons, (according to human rights groups), \\"routinely subject detainees to physical and psychological ill-treatment to obtain coerced confessions.\\"  Early life  Adnan Hassanpour was born to a Kurdish family in Mariwan, Iranian Kurdistan. He has one sister, Leili Hassanpour. Hassanpour is the cousin of Abdolvahed \\"Hiwa\\" Botimar, a journalist and environmental activist who was also tried in secret and accused of being an ‚Äúenemy of God‚Äù.  Political Views  Iran follows the Sharia Law, which the governing officials in most Islamic Republics interpret as the inequality of rights between genders, religions, sexual orientation, as well as any other practices that go against Islam. Hassanpour disagrees with this and was an advocate of cultural rights for Iranian Kurds.  Career  Before he was arrested, Hassanpour worked for several publications where he emerged as a great defender of rights to expression. He was managing director of the Marivan Literary Association from 2001-2004 and edited the association's literacy magazine, Rawat. He also worked for foreign media such as Voice of America and Radio Farda, which broadcasts in Persian to Iran. Among the many publications he worked with, Aso was the most infamous. Hassanpour is the former editor of the journal, which was banned in Iran in August, 2005. This publication was critical of the establishment and how it violated the cultural rights of citizens.  Adnan Hassanpour Arrested  In 2005, Hassanpour was summoned to shed light on the way the magazine covered protests in Iran. These summonses led to his subsequent trial and sentencing, as well as the demise of Aso. He was unexpectedly arrested on January 25, 2007, two weeks before his scheduled trial. In April 2007, after being held for four months in detention, without access to a lawyer, Hassanpour was charged by Revolutionary Court prosecutors with ‚Äúespionage,‚Äù ‚Äúacting against national security,‚Äù and ‚Äúactive armed resistance against the state‚Äù (moharebeh), which is punishable by death under Iran‚Äôs penal code. The revolutionary court in the city of Marivan condemned Hassanpour to execution solely based on interrogation reports produced by the Ministry of Intelligence. He was sentenced to death after he was convicted of spying and being a threat to national security. Adnan Hassanpour deprived of his legal right to furlough Adnan Hassanpour has spent 7 years in prison, making him the longest standing prisoner among journalists. He is serving his sentence behind bars in Sanandaj prison, deprived of his legal right to furlough, without a single hour of release during these years.Committee of Human Rights Reporters 2 February 2013 Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International have spoken out on behalf of Hassanpour.https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/017/2007/en  Legacy  Adnan Hassanpour, a journalist and advocate of cultural rights for Iranian Kurds, is a member of the Kurdish Writer's Association.

The area surrounding the pass is mostly forest, with the San Isabel National Forest to the east and the Gunnison National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide is marked at the saddle point of Cottonwood Pass. It is also the highest pass with an improved road in the state, the third-highest paved road in the state, and the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. The pass is closed seasonally due to heavy snowfall, typically from around October until sometime in May. When open, the pass can be accessed from Buena Vista to the east by following Chaffee County Road 306. Near the summit, the road name changes to Gunnison County Road 209 as it continues to the west, passing near Taylor Park Reservoir and continuing down into the town of Almont. The road is fully paved on both sides. When open, the pass is one of the few routes through the Sawatch Range accessible in a standard two-wheel drive passenger vehicle. Independence Pass is another such seasonal route through this mountain range, while efforts are made to ensure that U.S. 50 at Monarch Pass remains open year-round for all vehicles, barring extreme weather conditions.

History It was in 1878 that a manufacturing site was first opened to produce lenses and frames in Calalzo di Cadore, in the Venetian Alps. The Safilo name dates back to 1934, when Guglielmo Tabacchi bought this first Italian production site and founded a new eyewear company, making it the oldest player in the Italian eyewear industry. In the 1930s, exports expanded to many European countries, North Africa, the Middle East and South America. During the second world war, Safilo was forced to produce only one type of eyewear, a celluloid frame in two colours, amber and reddish Havana brown, that were all sent to Germany. After the war, exports to other European nations resumed and operations expanded to Rome and Milan with exports beginning in the United States. In 1974, the founder of Safilo died and his sons took over running the business. In the 1970s, Safilo opened sales offices in various European nations, patented the Elasta hinge, and introduced a popular UFO model of sunglasses. In the 1980s, Safilo developed designer collections and gained full control of American eyewear company Starline Optical Corp. He subsequently acquired then sunglass-maker Friuli-based Oxsol and listed Safilo on the Milan Stock Exchange. In the 1990s, Safilo entered the Asian market in Hong Kong, opened branches in more European nations, South Africa, Japan and Brazil, acquired American sports eyewear maker Smith Sports Optics, Inc, and Austria's Carrera Optyl. In May 2001, Safilo Chairman Vittorio Tabacchi began a takeover bid in which he acquired full ownership of Safilo. The company returned to the Milan Stock Exchange in December 2005. Also in 2001, the company inaugurated its new centralized warehouse at its Padua headquarters, a state-of-the-art structure with highly automated facilities. At this point, the distribution platform consisted of three main centres, located in Padua; Denver, Colorado; and Hong Kong. In 2002, Safilo acquired the Solstice Sunglasses chain in US. In 2008 and 2009, Hal Holding NV increased its ownership to 37.23% of the company. In January 2018, Safilo Group launched luxury eyewear collections along with Elie Saab Couture and Oxydo brands.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on November 12, 2009. In the episode, Leslie and the parks department bicker as they work on a proposal for a new town hall mural, while Ron and Andy share an awkward moment at Andy's new shoe-shine job. The episode was written by Rachel Axler and was directed by Millicent Shelton. The title refers to the figure of speech that a camel is a \\"horse made by a committee\\", and refers to the final mural proposed by the parks department. \\"The Camel\\" included references to several Indiana celebrities, including Greg Kinnear, John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson and David Letterman, all of whom have a place in the mural representing Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Stand-up comedian Kirk Fox made a guest appearance as Joe, from the Pawnee sewage department. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"The Camel\\" was seen by 4.67 million viewers, a drop from the previous week. The episode received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for the Ron and Andy subplot, and the jokes involving Jerry's \\"murinal\\". Plot The Pawnee council decides it will replace the town hall's \\"Spirit of Pawnee\\" mural, which has been repeatedly vandalized because of its racist overtones. When each Pawnee department is asked to propose a new mural, Leslie (Amy Poehler) becomes determined for the parks department to win, especially after she is taunted by \\"Sewage\\" Joe (Kirk Fox) in the sewer department. Everyone in the parks department is told to come up with a possible mural. Tom (Aziz Ansari) pays a local artist (Doug Anthony Jones) to make a painting for him, and he is initially unsatisfied with the result, a colorful abstract painting. When presenting it to the staff, however, he suddenly experiences his first emotional reaction to a work of art. Ann (Rashida Jones), who acknowledges a lack of creative talent, presents a rendering of a park that is widely panned by the others. April (Aubrey Plaza) presents a dark and bizarre piece made of garbage she found in a dumpster. Donna (Retta) presents a version of The Last Supper with famous people from Indiana. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) presents a beautiful pointillist photomosaic of city hall, but everyone laughs at him when he accidentally calls his mural a \\"murinal\\". Leslie proposes a picture of a historic Pawnee bakery fire, which she thinks will win because it is dark and depressing. When the parks department casts votes for the best mural, they each vote for their own artwork. As a compromise, Leslie creates a mural using pieces of everybody's artwork, but the result is an ugly and confusing mess. Leslie enlists the help of Mark (Paul Schneider), who draws a bland but skillful sketch of an old man feeding pigeons in the park. Mark himself admits the sketch is dull, but claims it will win because it has mass appeal. Nobody in the parks department likes it except Ron (Nick Offerman), but Leslie insists on entering it so they will win, much to everybody's disappointment. While waiting to present the sketch, Leslie sees how much fun other departments had in making their mural, and she decides to enter the parks department's original mural after all. The town council committee are confused by the proposal, but the parks department have fun presenting it and break into laughter. In the end, the town decides not to spend any money on a new mural and simply renames the old one \\"The Diversity Express\\". The parks department is nevertheless proud of their work, which they hang in their conference room; Ron also hangs Mark's sketch in his office. In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) is doing well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is impressed when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe so he can get a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide it would be best to simply pretend it never happened. Production Stand-up comedian Kirk Fox made a guest appearance in \\"The Camel\\". \\"The Camel\\" was written by Rachel Axler and directed by Millicent Shelton. It derives its title from the figure of speech that a camel is \\"a horse made by a committee\\". When the parks department puts together a mural proposal using elements of six different pieces of art, which Mark refers to in the episode as a camel. The episode features a guest appearance by stand-up comedian Kirk Fox as Joe, Leslie's nemesis from the Pawnee sewer department. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, a deleted scene from \\"The Camel\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the 90-second clip, Ann tries to get out of helping with the mural, April looks through a dumpster for inspiration and Ron defends \\"cookie cutter art\\" by saying, \\"There's nothing wrong with a cookie cutter. You know what you get with a cookie cutter? Perfectly shaped cookies!\\" Cultural references Leslie indicates she had a dream involving American actress Gina Gershon. For her mural, Donna proposes a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper with Indiana natives in place of the apostles. Actor Greg Kinnear was chosen to replace Jesus, with the Apostles replaced by John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, David Letterman and a NASCAR race car, among others. Jerry presents for his mural a work of pointillism, a style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wider image. When proposing her somber mural, Leslie claims tragedy often succeeds in awards, and specifically cites the Academy Awards which honor the film industry. As an example, Leslie uses The English Patient, the 1996 Best Picture winner during the 69th Academy Awards. Upon first receiving his painting, Tom says, \\"It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles\\", a reference to the multi-colored candies. Leslie, upon the idea of putting the best parts of each design into a new mural, says it is like having Michelangelo, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis do one painting. When Mark tries to get out of helping with the mural, he uses the excuse, \\"I was gonna go to Arby's and watch Frontline\\", a reference to a fast food restaurant chain and a Public Broadcasting Service public affairs program. Ron names his bunion Paul, after the mythological lumberjack Paul Bunyan. Reception In its original American broadcast on November 12, 2009, \\"The Camel\\" was seen by 4.67 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, about a five percent drop from the previous week's episode, \\"Ron and Tammy\\". The episode received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN said \\"The Camel\\" was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed \\"each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix\\". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the \\"murinal\\" scene involving Jerry and the fact that no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on \\"the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything\\". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared \\"The Camel\\" one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot \\"made me laugh as hard as I have in a very long time\\", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet and ridiculous moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together. The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said the episode included great lines, strong personality-driven comedy and good character moments, specially Tom's emotional reaction to his painting. Pierce said the Andy and Ron subplot was \\"so well played that it threatens to usurp the mural storyline\\". Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the \\"murinal\\" jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that \\"Child labor laws are ruining this country.\\" Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said make jokes connected in \\"The Camel\\", including the Andy shoeshine plot and the \\"unexpectedly glamorous\\" sewage department. But he particularly praised the character development in the main plot, in which \\"each in their own way sticks to the purity of their uniquely screwy ideas\\". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student praised the entire cast, particularly Offerman and Pratt, who he said provide the show's two best characters. Sanders said the fact that the episode included a \\"hilarious subplot\\" involving both of them \\"was more evidence that the writers have been listening to the fans\\". GQ writer Dan Fierman said Parks and Recreation appeared to be \\"approaching early Simpsons-levels in its absurdity and comic pacing\\". He suggested this could be due to the use of Mike Scully, a veteran comic writer with the animated series, as a consulting producer on Parks and Recreation. In an article reflecting on the Parks and Recreation second season, which became critically acclaimed following poor season one reviews, Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner said the plot of \\"The Camel\\" \\"can be read as something of a Season 2 mission statement\\". Weiner compared Leslie's decision to submit the quirky collage rather than the safer bet as reflective of the Parks and Recreation writing staff's apparent decision \\"to ride their zaniest whims rather than tamp them down for something more readily recognizable as a hit sitcom\\". DVD release \\"The Camel\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

He began learning martial arts in 1954. After receiving his black belt, Gaylord became the second generation of the Emperado Method of Kajukenbo. In 1963, he moved from Hawaii to Northern California where he began teaching his own style of Kajukenbo, which became known as the \\"Gaylord Method\\". Gaylord was featured in Episode 10 of Fight Quest on the Discovery Channel. Kajukenbo Association of America In 1967 Charles Gaylord, along with other accomplished Kajukenbo practitioners Aleju Reyes, Joe Halbuna, Tony Ramos, and Al Dacascos formed the Kajukenbo Association of America (KAA.) The KAA organization lasted until the early 1970s, but it was brought back in 1980 under the leadership of Charles Gaylord who had recently received his 9th degree black belt under founder Adrian Emperado. Fifteen years later in September 1995, the KAA and all of its black belts promoted Charles Gaylord to the honorary rank of 10th degree black belt. Grandmaster Gaylord's traditional Kajukenbo curriculum continues to be taught by his chief instructors who operate Kajukenbo schools in Hawaii and other parts of the United States.

It is the second single released from the band's second studio album, Sound Awake. Music video On 9 November 2009, a video was posted on YouTube for the single. In the video, the band members appear to be lost in a giant maze with snowflakes drifting down from the sky. All members are playing their separate instruments, while Ian Kenny is singing and wandering around in the maze. Once the song goes into the chorus, all the members except Ian appear together (whereas before they were wondering apart) and start jamming, while a black substance shoots up into the sky around them. All this is mixed with footage of water rushing down a section of the maze. This is how the video continues until the end, which shows Ian kneeling in front of what looks like a giant mirror. A transparent hand reaches out of the mirror, and just when Ian's hand is about to touch the other hand the song ends and the video fades out. Song name(s) \\"All I Know\\" was not the first name the song was under. In fact, it had several. When the song was first made, it was under the name \\"Rape\\". The band became dissatisfied with this, and changed the name to \\"Pear\\", which is an anagram of \\"Rape\\". Again the band did not like this, so they lengthened the name to \\"Pearogram\\". This is the name it was under when it was first previewed, along with other songs from the album, at live shows. Then, before the album's release, the name was changed one last time, to \\"All I Know\\".

(Maximum Uncertainty Principle) For any event, if there are multiple reasonable values that an uncertain measure may take, then the value as close to 0.5 as possible is assigned to the event. Uncertain variables An uncertain variable is a measurable function Œæ from an uncertainty space (\\\\Gamma,L,M) to the set of real numbers, i.e., for any Borel set B of real numbers, the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi\\\\in B\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma\\\\xi(\\\\gamma)\\\\in B\\\\\\\\} is an event. Uncertainty distribution Uncertainty distribution is inducted to describe uncertain variables.

Then for any given numbers t > 0 and p > 0, we have ::M\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi\\\\geq t\\\\\\\\}\\\\leq \\\\frac{E[\\\\xi^p]}{t^p}. Theorem 2 (Liu, Chebyshev Inequality) Let \\\\xi be an uncertain variable whose variance V[\\\\xi] exists. Then for any given number t > 0, we have ::M\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi-E[\\\\xi]\\\\geq t\\\\\\\\}\\\\leq \\\\frac{V[\\\\xi]}{t^2}. Theorem 3 (Liu, Holder's Inequality) Let p and q be positive numbers with 1/p + 1/q = 1, and let \\\\xi and \\\\eta be independent uncertain variables with E[\\\\xi^p]< \\\\infty and E[\\\\eta^q] < \\\\infty. Then we have ::E[\\\\xi\\\\eta]\\\\leq \\\\sqrt[p]{E[\\\\xi^p]} \\\\sqrt[p]{E[\\\\eta^p]}. Theorem 4:(Liu [127], Minkowski Inequality) Let p be a real number with p\\\\leq 1, and let \\\\xi and \\\\eta be independent uncertain variables with E[\\\\xi^p]< \\\\infty and E[\\\\eta^q] < \\\\infty. Then we have ::\\\\sqrt[p]{E[\\\\xi+\\\\eta^p]}\\\\leq \\\\sqrt[p]{E[\\\\xi^p]}+\\\\sqrt[p]{E[\\\\eta^p]}. Convergence concept Definition 1: Suppose that \\\\xi,\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots are uncertain variables defined on the uncertainty space (\\\\Gamma,L,M). The sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_i\\\\\\\\} is said to be convergent a.s. to \\\\xi if there exists an event \\\\Lambda with M\\\\\\\\{\\\\Lambda\\\\\\\\} = 1 such that ::\\\\mbox{lim}_{i\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\xi_i(\\\\gamma)-\\\\xi(\\\\gamma)=0 for every \\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Lambda. In that case we write \\\\xi_i\\\\rightarrow \\\\xi,a.s. Definition 2: Suppose that \\\\xi,\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots are uncertain variables. We say that the sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_i\\\\\\\\} converges in measure to \\\\xi if ::\\\\mbox{lim}_{i\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}M\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_i-\\\\xi\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\\\\\}=0 for every \\\\varepsilon>0. Definition 3: Suppose that \\\\xi,\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots are uncertain variables with finite expected values. We say that the sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_i\\\\\\\\} converges in mean to \\\\xi if ::\\\\mbox{lim}_{i\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}E[\\\\xi_i-\\\\xi]=0. Definition 4: Suppose that \\\\Phi,\\\\phi_1,\\\\Phi_2,\\\\ldots are uncertainty distributions of uncertain variables \\\\xi,\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots, respectively. We say that the sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_i\\\\\\\\} converges in distribution to \\\\xi if \\\\Phi_i\\\\rightarrow\\\\Phi at any continuity point of \\\\Phi. Theorem 1: Convergence in Mean \\\\Rightarrow Convergence in Measure \\\\Rightarrow Convergence in Distribution. However, Convergence in Mean Leftrightarrow Convergence Almost Surely Leftrightarrow Convergence in Distribution. Conditional uncertainty Definition 1: Let (\\\\Gamma,L,M) be an uncertainty space, and A,B\\\\in L. Then the conditional uncertain measure of A given B is defined by ::\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{A\\\\vert B\\\\\\\\}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{A\\\\cap B\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\} }, &\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{if }\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{A\\\\cap B\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\} }<0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\displaystyle 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{A^c\\\\cap B\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\} }, &\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{if } \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{A^c\\\\cap B\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\} }<0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.5, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} ::\\\\text{provided that } \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\}>0 Theorem 1: Let (\\\\Gamma,L,M) be an uncertainty space, and B an event with M\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\} > 0. Then M{¬∑B} defined by Definition 1 is an uncertain measure, and (\\\\Gamma,L,M\\\\\\\\{\\\\mbox{¬∑}B\\\\\\\\})is an uncertainty space. Definition 2: Let \\\\xi be an uncertain variable on (\\\\Gamma,L,M). A conditional uncertain variable of \\\\xi given B is a measurable function \\\\xi_B from the conditional uncertainty space (\\\\Gamma,L,M\\\\\\\\{\\\\mbox{¬∑}_B\\\\\\\\}) to the set of real numbers such that ::\\\\xi_B(\\\\gamma)=\\\\xi(\\\\gamma),\\\\forall \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma. Definition 3: The conditional uncertainty distribution \\\\Phi\\\\rightarrow[0, 1] of an uncertain variable \\\\xi given B is defined by ::\\\\Phi(xB)=M\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi\\\\leq xB\\\\\\\\} provided that M\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\}>0. Theorem 2: Let \\\\xi be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution \\\\Phi(x), and t a real number with \\\\Phi(t) < 1.

The movie was directed by Victor Saville, based on the novel by A.S.M. Hutchinson. The film tells the story of an English textbook writer who takes in a pregnant girl. The novel had previously been made into the 1923 film If Winter Comes. Plot Set in the English village Penny Green in 1939, the film focuses on Mark Sabre (Walter Pidgeon), an author and publisher who is unhappily married to Mabel (Angela Lansbury), a cold, humorless woman who usually spends her days gossiping with the townspeople. When Mark finds out his former sweetheart Nona Tybar (Deborah Kerr) is returning to Penny Green, Mark, unlike his wife, is delighted. Nona is married to Tony Tybar (Hugh French), but is still in love with Mark. Mabel is aware of Mark's feelings for Nona, and encourages him to spend time with her, thinking he will eventually decide with whom he wants to spend his life. As the war starts, Tony is called into the military; Mark attempts to join up but a doctor finds a heart condition and prevents him. Nona leaves Penny Green in order to join the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Life becomes quiet for Mark, until Effie Bright (Janet Leigh), who has been disowned by her father for becoming pregnant, turns to him for help. Mark helps Effie, and lets her live in his home while he looks for a better situation for her. This causes a great scandal, and the townspeople soon denounce Mark. He loses his job as a result of the morals clause at his place of employment. Mabel leaves Mark, believing that he has fathered Effie's baby, and serving Effie with the notice that she is co-respondent in the divorce. Effie, who was already under mental stress because the real father of the baby had not written her, commits suicide by poisoning herself. At the inquest to determine Effie's cause of death, numerous witnesses give anecdotal evidence suggesting a sexual relationship between Mark and Effie. Nona appears, having just learned of Tony's death, and makes a short speech in support of Mark's character. The inquest determines that Effie's cause of death was suicide, though they censure Mark for his behavior. Returning home, a distraught Mark finds a note addressed to him from Effie. In it, Effie names her lover: Harold Twyning, the son of Mark's former coworker. Mark furiously goes to confront young Twyning's father, but when he gets there, the man is grief-stricken, just having received the news that his son has been killed in the war. Mark decides not to share the letter with him, but just as he is about to burn the letter, he has a heart attack and passes out. Weeks pass as Mark convalesces. Nona returns to Mark, and they burn Effie's letter together.

Selznick bought the rights of the novel in 1939 and intended on casting either Joan Fontaine or Vivien Leigh in the female lead roles and Leslie Howard or Laurence Olivier in the male leads. Furthermore, John Cromwell was assigned as the film's director. Production was supposed to start on March 1, 1940, but Selznick eventually abandoned the project and sold the rights to Alexander Korda. In 1943, Robert Donat was set to star and the production, which was still under direction of Korda, was set to be filmed on location. Donat was supposed to reteam with Greer Garson, with whom he previously starred in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). However, when Donat suddenly became unavailable, he was replaced by Walter Pidgeon in October 1943. Because the reteaming collapsed, Garson's part went to Deborah Kerr, whose participation was confirmed in April 1947. Direction eventually went to Victor Saville, who had no interest in the project but agreed to direct it in order to work with Kerr.Evergreen: Victor Saville in his own words by Victor Saville and Roy Moseley. p.171 Impressed by her performance in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), Saville assigned Angela Lansbury as Mabel Sabre. The casting of Janet Leigh followed in the summer of 1947. Her accent in the film was coached by the niece of C. Aubrey Smith. Saville, determined on making films visually more realistic, introduced \\"indirect lighting\\" in the film.Evergreen: Victor Saville in his own words by Victor Saville and Roy Moseley. p.172 Reception The film earned $1,115,000 in the US and Canada and $834,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $465,000.

Biography El- Sheikh was born in Sudan. =Education= El-Sheikh graduated from the faculty of Shari'ah and Law of Omdurman Islamic University, Sudan, in 1969. In 1973 he was appointed by the Department of Justice to serve as a judge for the Shari'ah Courts. While in the Sudan he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1978, he was granted a scholarship to come to the United States in order to continue his higher education. He received his Masters of Comparative Jurisprudence (MCJ) from Howard University in 1980, his LLM from the National Law Center at George Washington University in 1981, and his Ph.D. in Comparative Jurisprudence from Temple University in 1986. His 1986 Ph.D. dissertation at Temple University was on \\"The applicability of Islamic penal law (qisas and diyah) in the Sudan.\\" =Career= From 1983‚Äì1989 and 1994‚Äì2003, El-Sheikh was the imam at the Islamic Society of Baltimore in Catonsville, Maryland. El-Sheikh was instrumental in founding the Muslim American Society in the US, in 1992, along with some other former members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He said that when they founded the society the founders' goals had changed, in that they no longer needed to operate secretly as they had in other countries when they were members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He said the founders felt \\"we should cut relations with the [Brotherhood] abroad and regard ourselves as Americans. ... We don't receive an order from any organization abroad, and [they] have no authority to tell us what to do\\". He also helped launch the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, and later was the Imam of the mosque between August 2003 and May 2005. Commenting in 2004 on the beheadings of American hostages Nick Berg and Daniel Pearl, he said: > beheadings are not mentioned in the Koran at all. According to Islamic penal > law, killers will be sentenced to death, but the means of execution are not > mentioned. ... we don't condone this. They are not following Islam. They are > following their own whims. And in 2004, speaking of Palestinian suicide bombers, he said \\"if certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle.\\" He left Dar Al-Hijrah in 2005 to become the executive director of the Fiqh Council of North America, an association of Islamic legal scholars.Sheridan, Mary Beth, \\"Leader Named at Mosque; Falls Church Site Selects Activist,\\" Washington Post, June 11, 2005, accessed November 7, 2009 He is also the head of the Islamic Judiciary Council of the Shari'ah Scholars' Association of North America (SSANA). Controversies Following the announcement of Barack Obama's visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore in 2016, many conservative media outlets accused the organization of having \\"historic\\" and \\"deep\\" ties to extremism or radical Islam, including Fox News, The Washington Times, The Daily Caller, and Breitbart News. Many of these conservative outlets focused on Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh. In 2004, El- Sheikh told The Washington Post, \\"If certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle.\\" The comment gained controversy with several media outlets, such as The Daily Caller, Fox News, and The Washington Times. ThinkProgress, however, commented that these \\"right-wing outlets omitted that fact that the quote was a specific reference to the uptick in violence between Israelis and Palestinians ‚Äî not Americans ‚Äî and that Sheikh immediately added that 'condemnation of indiscriminate killing of civilians' was widespread in his community.\\" El- Sheikh is also a former imam of the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Virginia. Anwar al-Awlaki, who was allegedly centrally involved in planning terrorist operations for Al-Qaeda, preached and made sermons at the mosque in 2001. Despite the statements made by news outlets, El-Sheikh \\"never delivered those sermons himself,\\" as noted by ThinkProgress. The mosque was also served by imam Mohammed al-Hanooti in the 1990s, who was \\"named as an unindicted co- conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\\" El-Sheikh was a member and \\"leading figure\\" of the Muslim Brotherhood in Sudan before moving to the United States in 1978. However, as he told The Washington Post, he cut relations with the group in 1992. El-Sheikh was also a co-founder of the Muslim American Society, a group controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. El- Sheikh was also a regional director for the Islamic American Relief Agency, whose parent organization has been cited by the U.S. Treasury Department for connections to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

He is credited as the pioneer in studying polymerization of synthetic rubber as well as inventor of various industrial technologies for production of synthetic rubber, polymers and pharmaceuticals. Early life Ostromislensky was born in Oryol, Russia to a family of a nobleman, a poruchik of elite corps. He received his education first at the Moscow cadet corps and then, from 1898 to 1902 at the Moscow Technical School. After graduation, in April 1902, Ostromislensky went to Germany, and enrolled to the Technical School in Karlsruhe. There, he specialized in physical chemistry, organic chemistry and electrochemistry. In July 1906 he returned to Russia and in February 1907 was hired at the Moscow State University (MSU) as an assistant in the laboratory of inorganic and physical chemistry, led by Professor Sabaneev. In 1909, Ostromislensky became a privatdozent of MSU. During his work at MSU, he actively collaborated with Professor L. Chugayev, who headed the laboratory of organic and general chemistry, and started his work on synthetic rubber. cited sources: ; –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤ –í.–ê., –í–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ï.–í., –ö—É–∑–Ω–µ—Ü–æ–≤–∞ –ì.–ò. \\"–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º—ã—Å–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á\\" –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫. –•–∏–º–∏–∫–∏. –ö–∏–µ–≤, 1984 (Russian) In 1912, after an internal quarrel, Ostromislensky resigned from the MSU. He continued his work on rubber (1912‚Äì1917) at Bogatyr (Russian: –ë–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã—Ä—å), which was Russia's main rubber company. The company director showed great interest in the emerging synthetic rubber and readily financed the work of Ostromislensky, who was the pioneer of synthetic rubber in Russia. In 1905, Ostromislensky started reporting his research on the polymerization of dienes and on the synthesis of the starting monomers for synthetic rubber. He had patented more than 20 ways to produce butadiene (buta-1,3-diene), which were implemented industrially in the Soviet Union. The butadiene production method, which was based on aldol condensation of acetaldehyde (1905), was also implemented on industrial scale in Germany in 1936. Another method was based on passing vapors of ethanol and acetaldehyde at 440‚Äì460 ¬∞C over aluminium oxide (1915) and received industrial use in 1942‚Äì1943 in the United States. In 1915, Ostromislensky also synthesized isoprene via pyrolysis of turpentine and polymerized it using light. Ostromislensky pioneered the studies of non-sulfur activators of vulcanization of rubber. He also proposed organic additions to rubber, such as toluidine and naphthylamine, in order to improve its properties. Those additives were later exploited by US companies, such as Union Carbide. In 1913, Ostromislensky published a book on \\"Rubber and its analogs\\", which was the first Russian textbook on chemistry and technology of rubber. It summarized most available bibliography on the subject, including foreign patents which were inaccessible to most Russian readers. The book also described 16 original methods of industrial synthesis and polymerization of dialkenes (alkadienes). In 1910s, Ostromislensky also started shifting his attention toward biochemical, immunochemical and pharmaceutical research, as indicated by that he had two doctoral degrees from University of Zurich, in philosophy and medicine. In 1913, he started his own company named \\"private chemical and bacteriological laboratory\\". There he performed a number of studies on the immunological specificity and chemical nature of antibodies and antigens and published the results in the Journal of Physical and Chemical Society in 1915. Ostromislensky investigated the possibility of synthesis of antibodies in vitro and proposed a theory of antibody synthesis, which is regarded as one of the first versions of the so-called matrix theory of antibody synthesis. The theory had strong influence on the development of immunochemistry, but was later proven incorrect. Medical interests of Ostromislensky are also illustrated by his essay on \\"dream in humans and animals\\", which examined the toxicological, immunological and physiological aspects of a dream. He considered sleep as a process of self-poisoning by some toxin, which shortens the lifetime. Between 1918 and 1920, Ostromislensky headed a chemical therapeutic laboratory of the Chemical-Pharmaceutical Institute in Moscow. There he studied the structure and properties of the popular foreign drug Salvarsan and developed the method of manufacturing a domestic analogue called Arsol. Arsol was based on relatively cheap production of colloidal arsenic that was important in the time of the Civil Wars and economic crisis in Russia. Life abroad In October 1921, Ostromislensky left Russia and moved to Latvia. There he assumed a position of assistant professor at the department of organic chemistry of University of Latvia in Riga. There he taught two major courses, on chemistry of rubber and on chemotherapeutic drugs. In May 1922, at the invitation of Dr. A. Hopkinson from the US \\"Rubber Company\\" Ostromislensky moved to New York. There he continued his work on chemistry and technology of rubber and pharmaceuticals in two companies, United States Rubber Company and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. In 1925, he opened his \\"Ostro Research Laboratory\\", where he studied the pharmaceutical properties of various compounds based on arsenic and vegetable oils which were used to treat leprosy. He also advocated commercial production of chemotherapeutic drugs pyridium and pyrazolone. In 1928 he received a US patent for production of polystyreneI. Ostromislensky (1928) \\"Polymerized styrol and its homologues\\" which was used by US Rubber for the first commercial production of polystyrene in the early 1930s. He also patented his early work on the synthesis of polyvinyl chloride in the US.I. Ostromislensky (1929) \\"Polymer of vinyl chloride and process of making the same\\" In 1930, Ostromislensky received U.S. citizenship and was invited to work in the company Union Carbide to develop commercial production of butadiene from ethanol. The production ceased only after the World War II, because it could not compete with butylene-based technologies. In the US, Ostromislensky improved several industrial technologies of synthetic rubber production. He also developed a technology for producing safety glass for the automobile windshields. In one of developed by him reactions, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde, which reacts with additional ethanol over a tantalum-promoted porous silica catalyst at 325‚Äì350 ¬∞C to yield butadiene:Kirshenbaum, I.

Becket played his entire four-year professional football career as a tight end and center for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union, and his 40 jersey is one of eight that has been retired by the club.  College career  Becket played college football for the Indiana University Hoosiers from 1947 to 1951.  Professional career  Following college, Becket was drafted in the 8th round of the 1952 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. Becket spurned the NFL and instead signed with the WIFU Saskatchewan Roughriders, where he starred for four years. He was named a Western All-Star in 1956, and was on his way back to Regina, Saskatchewan, on Flight 810 after playing in the East‚ÄìWest All-Star game in Vancouver, British Columbia, on December 8, 1956.  Death  Becket, along with Roughriders teammates, Mario DeMarco, Gordon Sturtridge, and Ray Syrnyk, were passengers on Flight 810 with another WIFU player, Calvin Jones, of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. All five players were present at the 1956 All-Star game in Vancouver, British Columbia, and were headed back to their respective teams' home cities.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon recurvus). It is a shrub with spikes of red flowers tipped with yellow in most months of the year and which often has leaves with their edges curled under. Description Melaleuca recurva is a shrub or small tree growing to high with hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, flat and narrow egg-shaped with the end tapering to a point. The leaves have indistinct veins and randomly distributed oil glands. The young leaves and branches have fine, silky hairs pressed against their surfaces. The flowers are bright red tipped with yellow and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering, sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The spikes are in diameter. The petals are long, fall off as the flower ages and there are 26-36 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs throughout the year but mainly in the cooler months and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca recurva was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon recurvus was moved to the present genus. Callistemon recurvus was first formally described in 1990 by Roger David Spencer and Peter Lumley in Muelleria from a specimen collected on Mount Stewart, east of Herberton. The specific epithet (recurva) is a Latin word meaning \\"recurved\\", referring to the leaves often being slightly bent backwards. Callistemon recurvus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca recurva by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca recurva occurs in the higher districts in Queensland from the Atherton Tableland south to the Bowen district where it grows in dense scrubland and on rocky outcrops near rivers. Use in horticulture Melaleuca recurva is often cultivated due to the presence of flowers through most of the year.

The film revolves around an American man falling for a Moroccan woman. They find out that their romance can put them in danger and they seek out the help of people they know. Filming started in Morocco on October 1, 2006. It was released in the United States on March 18, 2007 and was released on DVD on September 5, 2007. Plot Two friends, Luke (Stephen Dorff) and Adam (Neil Jackson) travel to Morocco to relax and have a party. Adam thinks it's the best way for Luke to get over the death of Luke's girlfriend. While Adam prefers night life and parties, Luke writes a diary and takes numerous photographs of the Morocco and Moroccan way of life. During one of the walks across the city, Luke meets a Moroccan girl Zahra (Sarai Givaty) who offers him the help as a tourist guide. They are immediately attracted to each other although they need to be careful not to violate local customs which forbid local women to have any close contacts with the foreigners. Zahra recognizes Luke's interest in exploring Morocco and invites him and Adam to a two-day trip to a remote village in the Atlas Mountains to show Luke some sights which are unseen by most tourists; Adam decides to join them the next day. When Luke and Zahra arrive to the village (previously a skiing center), they go to the only hotel left but are turned away by the angry receptionist who does not allow unmarried couples to stay overnight. They are forced to find another location to spend the night and they find a local man who invites them to spend the night in one of his cabins. They gladly accept his offer and he takes them to the cabin. During the night Luke discovers a hidden tunnel which spreads into a labyrinth; he finds out that the tunnels connect all cabins in the village. Later Zahra awakes and follows Luke and they explore more of the tunnel network. They follow a strange noise and discover a room with an operating table and a chest freezer full of stainless steel boxes. Luke opens one of the boxes and becomes frightened (although the content of the box is not revealed). He and Zahra try to reach their cabin but find out that somebody has picked up all candles Luke used to illuminate the tunnels. Finally they enter another cabin whose door is locked. While Luke tries to open the door, somebody grabs Zahra and drags her to the tunnels. Trying to find her, Luke is ambushed by a man who knocks him down unconscious. The next morning Adam takes a bus trip to the village to join Luke and Zahra but fails to find them. He is approached by a man who offered the cabin to Luke and Zahra. Adam recognizes him as Hossef, an acquaintance of Adam who invited him to the village before, although Adam refused to go that time. He takes Adam to the cabin where Luke and Zahra spent the night. Adam finds Zahra who is frightened but Luke has disappeared. Suddenly Hossef grabs a lever and tries to hit Adam but Adam manages to avoid the strike and subdues him. Together with Zahra they enter the tunnels to find Luke. They again enter the room that Luke and Zahra found before and a terrified Adam sees Luke's corpse lying on the operating table. It is revealed that the room is used for the illegal human organ harvesting and Zahra's role is to lure naive men into the village where they can be kidnapped and their organs taken. Adam is knocked down and regains consciousness tied up to the operating table with the team of surgeons (including Zahra) preparing the surgical tools. Adam asks why he and Luke were kidnapped and a flashback reveals the events which were staged to lure them into a trap - including a young girl who cuts Luke and a woman who scratches Adam during sex to get blood samples. The film ends with Zahra approaching an English tourist, Chris, whom she offers help. One of the stainless steel boxes with human organs is packed into the car and sent to the private hospital somewhere in the west.

Jung creates acoustic covers and arrangements, typically by ear and/or by watching videos, and composes original songs, both of which he plays and uploads online. He is often described as a guitar prodigy, though he prefers to be known as a \\"guitarist\\" rather than a \\"prodigy.\\" His YouTube channel currently has more than 6.44 million subscribers. Biography Jung developed an interest in guitar after watching his father play. He found his father's guitar playing more interesting than piano, which he was already learning. Jung's father taught him the basics, and after learning the basics, he developed his skill greatly just by trying to play what he heard. When he struggled he would study online videos. Jung came to play fingerstyle when his father discovered the technique on the internet. His first \\"idol\\" was guitarist Kotaro Oshio, from whom he developed an interest in fingerstyle guitar. At first, Jung's mother and grandmother disapproved of the \\"noise\\" that Jung and his father continuously created, but they came to understand it as his gift. Trace Bundy found a video of 9-year-old Sungha Jung playing Bundy's version of (Pachelbel's) Canon. The video impressed Bundy since it was a very difficult version. After seeing Jung's talent, Bundy toured twice to South Korea, and both times he got in touch with Jung and Jung opened for Bundy. During Bundy's performances he would call Jung up on stage and they would play Canon together in unison. In 2009 Trace Bundy flew Jung to the United States and the two did a U.S. West Coast tour. Since that time the two have played together often. Soon after his debut video on the internet, he garnered many supporters, from whom he asked for advice on his playing. His cover of \\"The Pirates of the Caribbean\\" theme song, which has over 61 million views on YouTube as of September 2020, made Jung an internet sensation, and his playing caught the attention of world-renowned guitarists, who found his covers of their songs impressive. Jung has since played on stage with them multiple times. Jung has received guitar lessons from Hata Shuji, a well-known Japanese jazz guitarist. He has also been mentored by German guitarist Ulli B√∂gershausen, who Jung has referred to as his musical inspiration, and from whom he learned much about composing and arranging. In a video, he recommended the \\"AllEars method\\" for those who like his style of guitar playing and want to learn it. In addition to steel-string and classical guitar, he has been recorded playing twelve-string guitar, electric guitar, ukulele, guitarlele, harp ukulele, and piano. He has also sung live, such as when he sang \\"Falling Slowly\\" at a concert in Bangkok. Apart from Korean, Jung speaks English, which he studied to be able to communicate during concerts abroad. =Guitars= Jung received his first guitar at age nine, a very coarse plywood guitar that cost less than $60. Upon discovering Jung's skill with the toy-like guitar, his father decided to buy him a better one ‚Äì a Cort Earth900. Jung began seriously playing with this guitar. His third guitar was a custom-made small- combo sized \\"All Spruce\\" Selma model, upon which Thomas Leeb wrote \\"KEEP ON GROOVING! TO MY FRIEND, THOMAS LEEB\\" In 2009, with the help of Ulli B√∂gershausen, he established sponsorship from Lakewood Guitars and currently plays Lakewood Signature Model instruments. =Practice and recording= Jung's daily practice time as a child was one to two hours long when there was school, and up to three hours during school breaks. Jung usually took an hour to figure out the notes and fingering to a piece, and typically took another five hours to practice before recording. However, to make his songs better and more accurate, he occasionally spent from a couple of days up to a month practicing. =Performances= In 2010, Jung was featured on Narsha's solo album NARSHA, for the song \\"I'm in Love\\". In 2011 he performed in the US with Trace Bundy, and also toured Scandinavia and Japan. In 2012 he collaborated with 2NE1, creating acoustic versions of the group's hit songs \\"Lonely\\" and \\"I Love You\\". Later in 2012, he participated in a live stage with BIGBANG's G-Dragon, where they performed \\"That XX\\". He performed \\"I'm Yours\\" with Jason Mraz, who described Jung as \\"amazing\\" and his \\"hero\\", in 2013. Jung played Ahn Hyeok in the 2011 Korean movie, The Suicide Forecast. Albums Jung released his first album, Perfect Blue, on 17 June 2010, his second album, Irony, on 21 September 2011, and his third solo album Paint It Acoustic on 15 April 2013. These three were recorded at Ulli B√∂gershausen's studio in Germany, each featuring increasingly more original compositions. Jung also recorded an album consisting of guitar duets called The Duets, released on 17 December 2012. Jung's fourth solo album, Monologue, almost exclusively composed of his own original pieces, was released on 28 April 2014. This album was recorded at Brickwall Sound in Seoul and produced by Jung himself. Jung's fifth solo album, Two of Me, was released on 1 May 2015 and consists entirely of original compositions. L'Atelier, his sixth solo album, was released on 13 May 2016 and has nine original pieces, as well as one original arrangement.

It was built in 1897 and added to the National Register of Historic Places July 2, 1981, as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. It is the fourth courthouse that has been used by the county. History =Former courthouses= The town of Camanche became the first county seat around 1840. Hotels and houses were used for county business instead of a dedicated courthouse. In 1841 the legislature of the Territory of Iowa allowed for the relocation of the county seat. A new townsite in the center of the county called Vanderburg was chosen. A frame building was donated for court purposes. The following year the town's name was changed to DeWitt to further honor DeWitt Clinton, for whom the county was named. A planned brick courthouse that would have cost $3,500 was never built due to a lack of support. As the size of the county government increased, court sessions were moved to the attic of the frame building while county offices occupied the rest of the building. The Exchange Hotel was acquired by the county in 1846 for more space. The county constructed a second courthouse in DeWitt measuring in 1854 for $6,000. It was similar in design to the Greek Revival Scott County Courthouse (1842) in Davenport. The contractors for the project were S.N. Bedford and T.P. & S.M. Butler. Its construction was unpopular as it was ordered by the county judge rather than the people. A jail was built in 1855. The former Exchange Hotel was destroyed in a fire in 1865. By then the population in the eastern part of the county, and in the city of Clinton in particular, had grown substantially. The decision to move the county seat there was made and a new courthouse, which measured , was built in 1869. It was a two-story structure that was built in 23 days, and it was initially rented by the county. By 1878 the building was too small and another building was built on its west side to house some county offices. =Present courthouse= Money to build the present courthouse was allocated in 1892. Poor construction and quicksand forced the foundation to be re-built. A new architect and contractor were hired and elections were held to approve additional funds, which all delayed construction. The building was finally completed in 1897 at a cost of $168,000. The design by M.S. Mansfield in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, beat eight other entrants in a design competition for the new courthouse. It is constructed of red sandstone and granite with copper covering the large central tower. The building also features a hip roof with dormers, parapet gable ends, and corner towers that are capped with a conical roof. Its historical significance is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Clinton as the county seat. with In August 2017, engineers found that one of the beams in the basement that supports the first floor failed due to regular wear. The courthouse was closed for two weeks so repairs could be made. Offices and court functions were temporarily moved to the county administration building.

The Godzilla (Main Theme) was re-used for the first time in Terror of Mechagodzilla, the final Godzilla film featuring the Showa era's continuity within the franchise.  Alterations  As the theme song was brought back in sequels, it was also altered to fit in with the tone of the film. When it was brought back in Terror of Mechagodzilla, the main title from the film was mixed with the theme song. The only two songs on the Terror of Mechagodzilla soundtrack that have the Godzilla Theme mixed with the main titles are \\"The Appearance of Godzilla\\", \\"Godzilla vs. The Mega-Monster Tag-Team\\", and the \\"Main Title\\" itself. On the Godzilla vs. Biollante and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah Soundtrack, the tracks \\"Begin The Attack!\\" and \\"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\\" are actually the \\"Godzilla Theme\\", but they are not altered in any way. On the Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah Soundtrack, the track \\"Godzilla's Resurrection\\" is a mixture of the Godzilla Theme and the Godzilla March, the second official Godzilla theme. The ending title track from Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the \\"Godzilla Theme\\" song with mixed excerpts from the King Kong vs. Godzilla soundtrack. Keith Emerson arranged the track for the Godzilla: Final Wars soundtrack, keeping the track titled as \\"Godzilla (Main Theme)\\". Bear McCreary arranged the track for the Godzilla: King of the Monsters soundtrack, keeping the track titled as \\"Godzilla Main Title\\" in addition to using it throughout the film as a theme for the titular character.

The brewery was founded in 1856 by German immigrants Anton Geiger and Simeon Hotz. Conrad Graf was the brewery's brewmaster, and its beer was named Graf's Golden Brew after him; Graf later came to own the brewery after Geiger's death. Graf was instrumental in inciting the 1884 Iowa City beer riots, a popular uprising against Iowa's new prohibition law; the rioting mob injured multiple law officers and city attorneys, one of whom successfully sued Graf for $7,000. The brewery continued to operate until Prohibition; during Prohibition, it attempted to produce soda, but residual yeast spores caused the soda to ferment. A network of tunnels connected the Union Brewery to two other breweries in Iowa City. The tunnels linked cellars and \\"beer caves\\" used by the breweries to store their products. The tunnels are well-preserved, and a developer has attempted to reopen them for tours or business use. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 10, 1986.

It was written in 1989 and was one of the earliest horror novels Stine wrote. The New Girl is one of the twelve Fear Street books that were reprinted in 2005. Plot summary Cory, a high school student, falls in love with Anna, a new girl at his school. As he tried to learn more about her, he begins to doubt her existence: most of his friends have never seen her on campus, and she's not listed in the school's files. When he calls her family's home someone on the other end insists that Anna is dead. When Cory visits Anna's house on Fear Street, he is met by a man who again insists that she is dead. A few nights later, Anna calls him asking to meet her, and implies that she is in danger and needs his help. When he meets her, she says she just wanted to see him, and kisses him, convincing him that she is real. She tells Cory the man he met at her house is her brother, Brad, and that he is \\"crazy\\" and possibly dangerous. At school, Cory's friend Lisa asks him to a school dance. Soon after, she finds a dead cat in her locker with a warning note attached to its neck. She suspects that Anna left it, being driven by jealousy over her friendship with Cory. At the dance, Lisa is pushed down a flight of stairs by Anna's brother, Brad. While attempting to pursue him, Cory and Lisa end up locked in the music room. Cory escapes and lets Lisa out, but Brad escapes. Coupled with Anna's begging Cory for help, he now understands Brad is behind all the trouble. Cory angrily travels to Anna's house to confront Brad soon after. He gets there and sees Anna and Brad fighting each other. It is revealed that Anna is actually Willa, Anna's sister. Willa killed Anna out of jealousy, following which she assumed Anna's identity. Willa has told Cory that Brad is insane and possibly her sister's murderer, but Cory now realizes it was the other way round. Brad was always trying to just warn him away. Cory and Brad manage to subdue \\"Anna\\" and call the police. At the end, it is implied that Cory begins a relationship with Lisa.

They have competed on and off over the years in Drum Corps International and Winter Guard International events. Currently, they are rebuilding their program in an attempt to return to Drum Corps International competition. History =1960s-1980s= The Edmonton Strutters began in 1963, and originally operated as the Wink Strutters Drum and Bugle Band. The band toured playing half time games, at Edmonton Eskimos Football games, and various parades. In 1968, the Wink Strutters Drum and Bugle Band reorganized, and were founded as a non-profit organization, becoming the Edmonton Strutters Drum Corps. Composed of young men and women ranging from age 12 to 21, the Corps averaged around 80 members. The Corps included a horn section, drums, color guard, rifles, and drum majors. Sopranos, mellophones, French horns, baritones and contrabass made up the brass section, while bass, snare, triplets, timpanis, and cymbals made up the drum section. The first tours as a Drum Corps took the group to British Columbia, Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and back into Alberta. The Northwest Drum Corps Association provided most of their competition during touring dates. In 1974, with an extensive competition schedule, they traveled to Vancouver (Washington), Bellevue (Washington), Seattle (Washington), Hillsboro (Oregon), St. Albert, Red Deer, Calgary, and Edmonton (Alberta), Kerkrade (Holland), Rastede (Germany), and then to Great Falls (Montana), for the Northwest Drum Corps Association Class 'B' Championships. They took 10 first places, 3 second places and 1 third place. The Edmonton Strutters continued to tour and compete throughout the USA and Canada. In 1976, they reorganized once again. In 1977 the Edmonton Strutters Drum Corps, dressed in Red, Black and Chrome, marched on the field as the 1st Canadian Regiment. In 1984 the corps merged with the Calgary Cavaliers to become the 1st Canadian Cavaliers for one competitive season. In 1988, The Strutters name was once again adopted, and the corps began rebuilding with a new image and much more casual style. =1990s= The competitive spirit of the group maintained, and the Corps' experienced a banner year at Drum Corps International World Championships in 1990, where they earned a 9th-place finish. In 1991, many Edmonton Strutters members were able to take the field by joining Calgary-based Allegiance Elite for the competitive season. After their exceptional 1990 season, The Strutters organization began to work toward maturity in their performance programs, resulting in increases to their overall score in DCI competition each year from 1992‚Äì1999, when they earned their highest score on record at Drum Corps International Finals. The 1999 Strutters took on a new look yet again, with modern white, green and black uniforms. The Edmonton Strutters drumline were the stadium drummers who performed at the 2001 IAAF World Track & Field Championships in Athletics, hosted in Edmonton, AB. This event was broadcast to over 200 countries. =2000s= In 2004, the Edmonton Strutters joined with Allegiance Elite of Calgary to temporarily form a group called \\"Fusion\\". This \\"Fusion\\" of the two groups brought The Edmonton Strutters great success as they made their way into DCI World Championship Finals for the first time in their history. The Edmonton Strutters performed for the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh during the royal visit for Alberta's centennial celebration in 2005. In Spring 2005, the Strutters organization went temporarily inactive on the DCI circuit. Beginning immediately afterward, re- organization began to facilitate a return to competition again in the coming years. The Strutters maintained their program offering drum lessons and a competitive Winter Guard International program throughout 2005‚Äì2007. In the fall of 2008, the Strutters introduced a new WGI program called \\"Movado\\" and competed for the first time at WGI's Power Regional in Nashville, TN, where they received 9th place, missing a finalist position by two spots. Also in 2008, the Strutters experienced a change of leadership in their organization and an overhaul of their programs, resulting in a more modern organization. They began building by temporarily introducing a \\"Junior Corps\\" program, aimed at a younger audience to begin growing their programs again. Strutters' \\"Junior Corps\\" was well received in their city, winning a number of parades, and increasing in membership throughout the season. In 2010, The Strutters became inactive as the organization restructured. The year 2014 marked the beginnings of a restoration of this group, who are now organizing to once again offer programming within the City of Edmonton and beyond.

By blinking this eye, he slowly dictated one alphabetic character at a time and, in so doing, was able over a great deal of time to write his memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Three days after it was published in March 1997, Bauby died of pneumonia. The 2007 film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a screen adaptation of Bauby's memoir.

In the years that followed, he started a legal battle for a right to assisted death. On 16 August 2012, his request was turned down by the High Court of Justice. On learning the outcome of his appeal, he refused to eat, contracted pneumonia, deteriorated rapidly and died a week later on 22 August 2012, aged 58. =Julia Tavalaro= In 1966, Julia Tavalaro, then aged 32, suffered two strokes and a brain hemorrhage and was sent to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, New York. For six years, she was believed to be in a vegetative state. In 1972, a family member noticed her trying to smile after she heard a joke. After alerting doctors, a speech therapist, Arlene Kratt, discerned cognizance in her eye movements. Kratt and an occupational therapist, Joyce Sabari, were eventually able to convince doctors she was in a locked-in state. After learning to communicate with eye blinks in response to letters being pointed to on an alphabet board, she became a poet and author. Eventually, she gained the ability to move her head enough to touch a switch with her cheek, which operated a motorized wheelchair and a computer. She gained national attention in 1995 when Richard E. Meyer of the Los Angeles Times published a cover story about Tavalaro. In 1997, Erika Duncan's profile of Julia and her co-author Richard Tayson, \\"Decades After Silence, a Voice Is Recognized,\\" ran in the Long Island edition of The New York Times and in April 1997, \\"The Long Road Home\\" appeared in Newsday. Julia Tavalaro appears with Richard Tayson on Dateline NBC and Melissa Etheridge's Beyond Chance (Lifetime).

Endoscopy units may be located within a hospital, incorporated within other medical care centres, or may be stand-alone in nature. In the early days of endoscopy, when fewer procedures were carried out, facilities such as operating theatres tended to be used; as the number of procedures carried out and the complexity of the procedures and equipment increased, the need for specialised rooms and staff became apparent.Anthony J.

Procedures performed within an endoscopy unit may include gastrointestinal endoscopy (such as gastroscopy, colonoscopy, ERCP, and endoscopic ultrasound), bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, or other more specialized procedures. Endoscopy units may be part of a hospital, where emergency procedures may be performed on ill patients admitted to hospital; however, most endoscopies are performed on ambulatory patients in the outpatient setting.  Layout  Endoscopy units consist of a number of areas: * Reception and waiting area for patients and relatives. * Consultation rooms. * Changing areas. * Procedure rooms. * Recovery area. * Decontamination area. = Procedure rooms = An endoscopy procedure room These are the rooms where the endoscopic procedures are performed. Procedure rooms should to contain: * Patient trolley. * Endoscopy 'stack' and video monitor(s) - this equipment contains the light source and processor required for the endoscopes to produce images. * Monitoring equipment to allow continuous monitoring of patient condition during procedures. * suction equipment to allow both aspiration of airway secretions and to allow aspiration of fluid through the endoscope. * Piped oxygen supply. * Medication used to provide procedural sedation. * Ancillary equipment - endoscopy biopsy forceps, snares, injectors (see Instruments used in gastroenterology). * Diathermy and/or Argon plasma coagulation equipment. * Computer(s) used to generate endoscopy reports. An endoscopy recovery area Procedure rooms should be at least in size, and hospitals should have at least two procedure rooms. Larger endoscopy units should contain one procedure room per 1,000 to 1,500 procedures performed annually. =Recovery area= Since a number of patients undergoing endoscopy receive sedation, and a few emergency patients may be unstable, there must be an area available for the observation of patients until they have recovered. These areas also need to have piped oxygen, full monitoring facilities (including pulse oximetry), suction, resuscitation equipment and emergency drugs.

The stream was entirely in Cobb County through early 1932, until that county ceded the town of Roswell to Fulton effective May 9.

History A windmill was recorded at Burum in 1578. The next mention of a mill at Burum was in 1711. This mill burnt down on 12 October 1785. In 1787 a new mill was built to replace it. Reinder Durks Hamming was the owner-miller from 1811 to 1832 and Harmannus Habbema was the owner-miller from c1860 until his death in 1881. Eelke de Kok of Buitenpost took the mill in 1888, working it until 1905 when his nephew Thijs Berends took over. In 1941 the mill was taken by J Bremer. The mill was restored in 1946, 1957, 1969 and 1975. In 1997, the mill was sold by the Bremers to the Gemeente Kollummerland. A further restoration was completed in 2000, the mill being officially reopened on 6 May - Nationale Molendag. (Click on Geschiedenis\\" to view.) The mill was completely rethatched in 2007.

At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel (103 cogs) drove a pair of diameter French Burr millstones via a lantern pinion stone nut with 27 staves. A second pair of diameter French Burr millstones were driven via a lantern pinion stone nut with 31 staves. The two pairs of millstones used for producing pearl barley were driven by lantern pinion stone nuts with 20 and 21 staves respectively.

The intention is to reduce heat losses into the wall by reflecting radiant heat away from the wall. It is a form of radiant barrier and is intended to reduce energy losses and hence decrease fuel expenditure.  Effectiveness  Studies based both on modelling and experiments have demonstrated modest improvements in energy losses through the walls of houses through this method. Harris shows that plain aluminium foil was only \\"marginally\\" less effective than a proprietarily-shaped foil that claimed to avoid temperature stratification. He reports that \\"reductions in the overall energy consumption of the [test] room of up to 6% were recorded by installing [plain] foil behind a radiator, while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30% of the original value\\". In his 3m cubed test room with a 1 x 0.5 m radiator and walls of average U value 0.44 W/m2K, he found that for a radiator temperature of 43 ¬∞C the heat flux through the wall behind the radiator reduced from 7.1 to 3.1 W/m2. Note that the average heat loss in the room was not reduced by such a large percentage as only part of the surface of the room was covered by radiators. He concludes that \\"in the test room used, which is the size of a small bedroom or sitting room, the total energy saved in a typical year in the UK‚Äôs climate would be of the order of 60 kWh\\". Baldinelli et al. support these findings and note that their \\"results show how the performance of the reflecting panel depends strictly on the insulation level of the external wall facing the radiator; more specifically, efficiency increases when the thermal resistance decreases, reaching energy savings of up to 8.8% in worst insulation conditions.\\" Although the foils are termed \\"reflectors\\", they do not have much effect on radiated heat or its reflection. As radiators work at a relatively low temperature, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann lawThe Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law states that the effectiveness of a thermal radiator is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. A hot-water radiator at has only 1/4 the radiated power of a stove at , or 1/16 that of a radiant element at means that they are weak radiators of heat. Most heat from a domestic radiator is as convection currents of heated air. Where a reflector foil also has some insulating ability against conduction (i.e. losses through the wall), it may have some useful effect. This is most pronounced when the wall itself has poor insulation performance: in a wall constructed to modern standards of insulation, even this effect may be reduced to a negligible benefit. The effect of placing a 10mm combined insulation and reflection behind radiators is about the same as that of 15mm insulation without a reflective layer. When the wall thickness behind the radiator is at minimum 1980 German standards this will reduce total heat losses of a building by about 4%. For a (by 1980s standards) well-insulated building heat losses can be reduced by about 1.6%.N. K√∂nig: \\"Der Einflu√ü von w√§remreflektierenden Folien in Heizk√∂rpernischen auf den Heizenergieverbrauch eines Hauses\\" https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ibp/de/documents/Publikationen/IBP- Mitteilungen-optimiert/058.pdf It is widely believed that a literal radiator reflector of ordinary aluminium kitchen foil is useful. This highly reflective foil is used with the shiny side facing towards the back of the radiator. However, as little of the radiator's heat is released by radiation anyway, there is little advantage in reducing losses to it. There is also a risk that reflectors made from kitchen foil may soon become inefficient, as aluminium oxidizes very quickly and then loses its reflective quality. A more effective DIY radiator reflector is a thin insulating layer (against conduction) of a lightweight insulator such as expanded polystyrene foam veneerWidely sold in 2mm sheet rolls as an insulator beneath wallpaper. or 3mm polyethylene foam, as used for laminate flooring underlay.

Lives in Licking Falls, Ohio. Cat lives with her mother and her maternal grandparents in a two-story house that was once a barn. Justina was date-raped by a vampire, and Cat was born fully developed a mere five months later. She was a vampire Hunter who started age 16 and later was the commander for a government operation set on killing bad vampires. Later she quit to be with her husband, Bones and soon after she decides to be changed into a vampire, but is only able to drink vampire and ghoul blood. Cat had red hair, grey eyes, is pale, curvy and about 5 foot 7. She also has a short fuse, but is a skilled fighter and is very strong willed. As a half-vampire, Cat has a mixture of human and vampire abilities. Her eyes glow green when she's upset, unless she can control them. She's stronger and faster than any human, and her hearing is better as well. She can see at night as easily as she can in the day. She's never been sick a day in her life. However, her sense of smell is that of a human's, and she does not have fangs or the ability to control minds. She has the circulatory and respiratory systems of a human, but her DNA has the same genetic structure‚Äîthe same strain of mutation‚Äîas that of a vampire's.

Of his early acting at Oxford, Cecil said After Oxford, he spent two years training for an acting career at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, where he was taught (amongst others) by Michael MacOwan and Vivian Matalon and where his contemporaries included Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi. Career Cecil's first television appearance was in playing a leading role opposite Vanessa Redgrave in \\"Maggie\\", an episode of the BBC television series First Night transmitted in February 1964, which he later called \\"a baptism by fire because I was being seen by half the nation\\". After that he spent eighteen months in repertory at Salisbury, of which he later commented, \\"You learnt how to make an entrance and make an exit.\\" His parts at Salisbury included the Dauphin in Saint Joan, Disraeli in Portrait of a Queen, Trinculo in The Tempest, and \\"all the Shakespeare\\". His first West End part came in May 1965 in Julian Mitchell's dramatisation of A Heritage and Its History at the Phoenix, in which he got good notices, and his next was in a Beaumont production of Peter Ustinov's Half-Way up the Tree, directed by Sir John Gielgud.

His screen work included the roles of Cummings in The Diary of a Nobody (1964), Captain Cadbury in the Dad's Army episode Things that Go Bump in the Night (1973), Bertie Wooster in Thank You, P.G. Wodehouse (1981), Ricotin in Federico Fellini's And the Ship Sails On (1983), and Captain Hastings (to Peter Ustinov's Hercule Poirot) in Thirteen at Dinner (1985), Dead Man's Folly and Murder in Three Acts (both 1986).

Wodehouse's books, performing voice characterisations for each character, and becoming possibly the most known narrator to ever perform the series. Cecil wrote occasionally for The Spectator and The Times Literary Supplement. In one piece he noted He also admitted that \\"... most of my experience has been in comedy, that‚Äôs the way life has taken me ... if I have any regrets, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt do parts with more depth\\". Personal life Cecil was married twice. He met actress Vivien Heilbron when they were both studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the couple married in 1963.

It is the sixth episode from Season 4, and the 71st episode overall. Plot It is Saturday morning and during breakfast Betty shows off her new tattoo to Ignacio and Hilda as she talks about enjoying the single life. When Justin breaks the news that he is going to assist the cheerleaders at the homecoming prom (based on Marc's advice to befriend popular girls to make it through high school) and he needs help, the family blows up because Ignacio's experience when he refused to let Hilda go to her prom when she was pregnant have come back (It turned out that Hilda was named homecoming queen the year she was pregnant). While they talk about Justin after they left the house, they run into an old friend named Bobby Talercio, whom Hilda once had feelings for and Betty had a crush on. Bobby is the school driver's education teacher, which happens to be his second job (he also works at an auto dealership). At the school, Marc helps Justin out with the uniforms for the cheerleaders, when a couple of guys come over to make fun of him. Marc sees him get humiliated and tells Justin that its time to try something different by helping out the \\"mean girls\\", with their routines, starting with Ava the head cheerleader. As the visit the house, they show off a routine they want to show to the cheerleaders at the homecoming, for which Justin tells the family that he's been invited to be a part of. At work, Betty and Daniel talk about The Community of the Phoenix, who Daniel believes is helping him in more ways than one, especially now that he is drinking their bottled water, wearing beads and going on a diet with Natalie. Betty and Claire becomes curious about his behavior. As Daniel runs into Amanda at the reception desk on a Saturday, Daniel convinces Amanda to go to the seminar as a way to change her life. Amanda, who now sees Daniel as somewhat of a friend, takes him up on the offer. At the get-together, Amanda starts to question the group's motives to Daniel after Natalie, who after secretly talking to Bennett when Daniel mentions recruiting people like Amanda but they see her as a problem, lashes out at Amanda because she doesn't have the \\"energy\\". Amanda tells Daniel that it's not too late to change his mind, but Daniel tells Amanda to go. When Bennett comes over to talk to him, he asks him that it's time to go to the next phase, which is \\"Level 5\\", in which Daniel will be able to communicate with his late wife Molly. A skeptical Daniel thinks about it. During a tea drinking, Bennett pours a cup to give to Natalie and Daniel. After Natalie takes a sip and coughs saying it tastes bitter, Bennett squeezes a couple of lemons to make it taste better and they watch Daniel drink the tea. As Matt runs into Betty, he gives her an assignment but she is not pleased that he gave it to Megan, so Betty tells Matt that if he wants an exciting feature, she is going to get him one. After she tells Daniel that she wants to be fearless, she decides to go up to Bobby later that afternoon to ask him about whether he would go out with her, but as we see fantasy sequences about Betty's true intentions, Betty lies to him, saying that she wants a driving lesson (even though Betty already knows how to drive). When Betty tells her family about hanging out with Bobby, Hilda and Ignacio are not happy about this for different reasons (his \\"bad boy\\" persona, for one), but Betty says that she's only doing it for the article. During her \\"driving lesson\\", Betty tries her best to test out attempt at the stick shift in front of Bobby. As a jaywalker runs in front of the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro she was driving, Bobby jumped out of the vehicle and takes the guy, they presses him in front of the window to make him apologize to Betty. After he gets back into the car, Betty asks him about if he was available and wants to join him for drinks at his uncle's bar. However, as she returned home, Betty was shocked to learn that Hilda and Archie just set her up with a guy named Larry, who happens to be Archie's bookkeeper. But Betty finds him boring and after dinner, she makes up an excuse to go to bed so she can sneak out to see Bobby, but hours later she is caught by Hilda after she is brought home by Bobby. Betty agrees to make it up to Hilda by escorting Larry to the homecoming. The following day, Betty is once again trying to learn stick shift from Bobby, and she now has the hang of it. When Betty sees Hilda, Archie, and Larry waiting for her at the house, she tells Bobby, who thinks she need to decide for herself what she wants to do. When he asked her to join him at a fast food joint, Betty said yes and floored the pedal. At the joint, Betty kept having fantasies about Bobby, but all Bobby would talk about was Hilda, even after Betty told him that Hilda was already seeing someone. At the homecoming, Betty shows up to the school to learn that Larry decided not to come from Ignacio. As Betty walked in, she runs into Bobby and have a conversation. As Betty admitted to him about having a crush on him, Bobby, flattered about Betty's admission, knew all along about being Betty's crush, but admitted to Betty about his true feelings for Hilda. Betty then gave Bobby a kiss and he walked away. Hilda sees this and as Betty catches up with her, she tells her sister that Bobby still has feelings for her. Marc arrives to see this tension between the sisters Suarez, only to be interrupted by Ava, who came up to Betty and Marc to warn them that something is about to happen to Justin at the auditorium. As they get there, they tell Hilda, Ignaico and Justin to leave, when they announce the homecoming queen is Justin. Although Hilda felt embarrassed, Justin decides to go up to the podium and accept the award, then told the crowd that the person who deserves it the most was his mother, so he hands over the tiara and roses to Hilda. As everyone hugs, the crowd applauds Justin. As they went home that night, Hilda told Justin about what he did and did not care what anyone thought about him. But Justin tells his family and Marc that he is actually straight and was pretending to act gay, saying that his flamboyant behavior was all a joke. Later that night at bed, Betty and Hilda made up over what happened with Bobby, with Hilda admitting that even though she is dating Archie, she may still have feelings for Bobby. As Wilhelmina gets off the phone with the detective, she becomes distressed with the fact that she could face jail time, so she tells Marc to make phone call to look for a model, for which Wilhelmina would offer her services. Unfortunately, it looks like she just landed a job with \\"Hot Flash\\". Claire gives the ground rules about this job. Later at the apartment, Nico frets about Wilhelmina's future when she mentions the only other option, Connor. Wilhelmina believes that Connor will find her and Nico, believing her, tells her mother that if she is going to do it for her, then do it for herself [Wilhelmina]. Hours later, Wilhelmina tells Claire that she is quitting as co-editor-in-chief. During the press conference, Wilhelmina made her announcement that her photo shoot in the Bahamas will be her last. The following day, Claire gets word from a detective about Connor Owens and their failed attempts to track the stolen money. When Wilhelmina walks in and overhears this, Claire tells her that Connor was found dead in Panama. This turn of events devastates Wilhelmina and she breaks down in tears.

Born in Manitoba, Robert Fulton Logan received his first art lessons in Winnipeg under Frank Armington. At the age of sixteen he enrolled at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, then at the Chicago Art Institute. Logan first journeyed to France during the First World War as an officer in the American navy. After the war, Robert Logan accepted the position of director at the Bellevue Art Training Center, in Paris, and also taught classes at the Louvre. He remained in Paris for almost twenty years. During his career, Robert Fulton Logan created over one hundred architectural etchings of scenes in France, Germany and Holland. The first important one-man showing of his etched art was held at the American Chamber of Commerce, Paris, (1922) and then at annual exhibitions at the Galerie Marcel Guiot. On his return to the United States in 1934, Logan accepted the position of Chairman of the Department of Art at Connecticut College, remaining there until his retirement in 1954. Robert Logan was a full member of the Chicago Society of Etchers, the National Arts Club (1922) and the Soci√©t√© internationale de la gravure originale en noir (1921). Today, examples of his original etchings are housed in the collections of the British Museum, London, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Cambridge University, the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris, the Museum of Luxembourg, the Metropolitan Museum, New York, the Library of Congress, Washington, and the Smithsonian Museum.\\" His obituary is available at https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat;=19591205&id;=fu0gAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=F3IFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=736,1313883 Gordon G.

Voters were asked whether they approved of a new constitution which would have replaced the constitution in force since independence in 1979. The proposal was supported by only 43.13% of voters in the referendum, well short of the required two-thirds threshold. If approved, the proposed constitution would have abolished the monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, headed by Queen Elizabeth II, and would have given more power to the opposition. The referendum was the first of its kind to be held by a member of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. Campaign Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves and his Unity Labour Party (ULP) campaigned heavily for the \\"Yes\\" vote, Gonsalves advocating that, though he had nothing personally against Queen Elizabeth II, he believed it was time for Saint Vincent to stop having a monarch as its head of state; he offered the opinion: \\"I find it a bit of a Nancy story that the Queen of England can really be the Queen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\\" Though he had earlier shown affinity towards executive presidents Hugo Ch√°vez and Fidel Castro, Gonsalves asserted that the proposed constitution for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would not have created such a presidential post; the Prime Minister argued that an executive presidency would give the office holder too much power in the small country. In an interview with the Trinidad and Tobago Express, he stated that type of presidency \\"may well make perfect sense\\" for the neighbouring country of Trinidad and Tobago, but such a government would not work in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, saying further: \\"it is our assessment that to conjoin the power of a prime minister with the power of a head of state, head of government, or head of state in our circumstances, that is a matter which will end up making that office holder more powerful than the current situation.\\" Opposition to the constitutional changes was led by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which held the position that the proposed constitution would neither reduce the power of the prime minister nor strengthen the country's democracy. The NDP's leader, Arnhim Eustace, opined that the Gonsalves government and opposition parties had not come to an agreement on a number of fundamental issues, including the Integrity Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Ombudsman, and the Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The CARICOM Secretariat announced that it would, at the request of the government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, officially observe the referendum, with the support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID), an agency of the government of Spain. Conduct Voting took place in heavy rain, with 52,262 of the 97,724 eligible Vincentiens casting ballots at 225 polling stations. The Supervisor of Elections opined that this was a good turn-out given the inclement weather.

It competed there but won no prizes. Design and development In 1920 George Handasyde left the Martinsyde company he had formed before World War I, with Helmut Martin, to form the Handasyde Aircraft Company. Two of the draughtsmen he took on became well known, Sydney Camm and Freddie Raynham. Handasyde, Raynham and Camm together designed a successful glider for the Itford glider competition in 1922 in which Raynham set a British record of 113 min, though this was only good enough for second place when Alexis Maneyrol set a world record of 201 min. The 1923 Lympne motor glider competition was a natural outcome from the Itford event, and Handasyde produced a monoplane for it. The all-wood Handasyde was a high-wing semi-cantilever monoplane, with parallel-chord wings that had slightly tapered tips. The wings were built up around two spars and covered with 1 mm plywood from the rear spar at mid-chord forward; on each side a lift strut linked the wing at about 1/3 span to the fuselage lower longeron. The wing was then fabric covered, with a wire-supported scalloped trailing edge. It carried narrow ailerons outboard. The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, tapering more in elevation than in plan. There were no fixed stabilisers at the rear, only an all moving rudder and undivided elevator. Both these surfaces were hinged to provide aerodynamic balance. The single cockpit was over the wing and towards the trailing edge, with some instruments built into the wing surface. Ahead of the wing the fuselage was short, with the air-cooled 750 cc Douglas flat-twin driving a two-bladed propeller. The diminutive undercarriage had thin and small diameter wheels (12 in or 305 mm) on a single axle mounted on short vertical extensions from the lower longerons. The Handasyde monoplane made its first flight on 9 September 1923, piloted by Raynham. Despite sharing the engine troubles experienced by most contestants, it managed to fly for 158.5 miles (255 km) at 65.7 mpg (23.3 km/litre). This was well behind the eventual winners, the Wren and the ANEC I, both of which achieved 87.5 mpg (31.0 km/litre). thumb The Handasyde Company failed in 1923 and the monoplane's end is not recorded.

Parallels can be seen in emergent properties and self-organization.\\"Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349 Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms. As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

Biography Born in Kingston, Thomas first recorded as a deejay at Tuff Gong studios in 1982, initially working under the name Junior Kong, named after his father.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 154 His debut single was \\"Pink Eye\\". He worked with GT and then his own Love Bunch sound system and then recorded for King Tubby's Firehouse label, now singing in a similar style to Tenor Saw. The early King Kong recordings for Tubby were over early digital rhythms, and included songs such as \\"AIDS\\" and \\"Babylon\\", and established him as a popular artist. His first album release was split with another of Tubby's singers, Anthony Red Rose, with Two Big Bull Inna One Pen issued on Firehouse. During 1986 and 1987, Kong recorded for several of Jamaica's top producers, including Prince Jammy, with whom he enjoyed his biggest hits with \\"Trouble Again\\" (the title track from his Jammy- produced debut album proper) and \\"Legal We Legal\\",Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, , p. 300 Black Scorpio, Harry J, Errol Thompson, Ossie Hibbert, Bunny Lee, and Prince Jazzbo.

The death of Tenor Saw in 1988 prompted King Kong to release \\"He Was a Friend\\" as a tribute, and in 1989 he relocated to England and recorded with Mafia & Fluxy and Gussie P in the early 1990s.

It was published in 1991, and followed by four subsequent novels: Blood Trail (1992), Blood Lines (1992), Blood Pact (1993), Blood Debt (1997), and one short stories collection - Blood Bank. Blood Price is also the title of first two episodes of the Lifetime series, Blood Ties, which is based on Tanya Huff's books. The Vicki Nelson book series is also known as ‚Ä≥Blood Books‚Ä≥. Plot Vicki Nelson is a former Homicide detective. When her diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) ruined her night vision and forced her to leave the police force, she became a private investigator. After becoming a witness in a brutal murder of a young man, who was drained to death, his desperate girlfriend Coreen Fennel hires her to investigate his death. Vicki tries to get some information from her former partner and competitor, Detective - Sergeant Mike Cellucci, which leads to their arguments over her involvement.. Coreen informs her that she thinks that the murderer is a vampire, so she begins what she calls ‚Ä≥hunting‚Ä≥, although she does not believe in the supernatural. The killer is claiming more victims, and when she accidentally walks in on a crime scene, she sees the killer turning into the dark and disappearing. Because of her bad sight, she is sure that it was just an illusion, and when she turns to the body, she sees a man in black next to the body, and tries to scream, but he punches her in the head, rendering her unconscious. When she wakes in an unknown apartment, the same man is searching her purse for some ID. She talks to him, and discovers that he is not a killer, but is also searching for him. He tells her that the killer is a demon, that she actually did see him disappear. He has an ancient book, a grimoire, that should help them. She also finds out that the stranger is Henry Fitzroy: romance writer and 450-year-old vampire. Surprisingly, she believes him. The two make a deal to catch the demon and the man who is calling it up. Her RP makes her useless at night and Henry sleeps during the day, so they agree to share the investigation. The two uncover that the murders are ritual, that each should call one of the demon's names, and that he should give material goods to the man who is calling him, for the price of blood. Henry tells her that he is the Duke of Richmond, the bastard son of Henry VIII,, who fell in love with the vampire Christina, who turned him. Vicki finds Henry almost dead in his apartment and the grimoire stolen and realises that he needs to feed to stay alive and heal, so she allows him to drink from her wrist. This makes a bond between them. While the investigation continues, Vicki discovers that the demon was called by a college student, Norman Birdwell, who is a new friend of Coreen's. Vicky tells Mike, but he does not believe her. When Coreen finds out what Norman is doing, she takes Vicki to his residence. He kidnaps the two of them, willing to sacrifice Vicki's blood to call a new, more powerful demon, Astaroth, who wants to bring about a Hell on Earth. Henry arrives in time to save Vicki and Coreen. Meanwhile, another demon is trying to trick the group, to procure as servants. Together, the three defeat him, and Mike Cellucci, who has been looking for Vicki, arrives in time to see Henry's vampire powers and the demon he fights with. Vicki, who almost bleeds to death, ends up in the hospital, receiving a blood transfusion. Mike comes to inform her about his police report, which leaves out the demon and Henry.

Nextbike was a bicycle rental scheme in New Zealand, franchised from the German Nextbike company. It operated in the CBD and central suburbs of Auckland City from 2008 to 2010. Due to lack of sufficient advertising revenue, the company ceased operations in that year after failing to win emergency funding from the new Auckland Council. However, it is expected to make a bid for a newly tendered contract by Council to provide a public bike rental scheme, as the bikes of the scheme are still present in storage.  History  , the bike fleet had grown from 70 to 170. The company notes that during summer, bikes were being ridden about three hours a day, which was higher than the use rate in some European schemes. To encourage use, registered riders also received 30 minutes free use each day. Unlike some much larger overseas schemes, the rental system has been implemented privately (financed by a combination of rental fees and advertising on the bikes) though it has recently won official sponsorship from the Auckland Regional Transport Authority.ARTA supports cycling Aucklanders w/ Nextbike (Press Release: ARTA, via 'scoop.co.nz', Wednesday, 7 October 2009.

Background  AWB (a private corporation owned by wheat growers) had been granted a monopoly over the export of wheat in Australia. No other company could export wheat in bulk without the AWB's consent. NEAT Domestic Trading was a grain trader. It requested consent to export wheat and was refused. NEAT then appealed this decision, ultimately to the High Court. NEAT claimed that AWB was acting in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the case, thereby invoking s5(2)(f) and s6(2)(f) of the Judicial Review Act 1977(Cth). The policy in question was that AWB would refuse export permits to other bodies.  Decision  Gleeson CJ found against NEAT on the grounds that the policy in question was legal, and that no material had been put to AWB that could persuade it to deviate from its policy. He concluded, although it was unnecessary to decide, that the decision was of an administrative character made under an enactment and therefore reviewable. McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ held that public law remedies (such as review under the JR Act) were not available against AWB because of the role granted to it under the Act, the private character of AWB, being a company incorporated under corporations legislation and the fact that it was impossible to impose public law obligations on AWB and allow it to pursue its private interests. Kirby J dissented, holding that the decision was one of an administrative character in the form outlined, and that the decisions at issue were each invalid and void.

Mackintosh was killed whilst observing the second day of the second Battle of Cambrai, 21 November 1917. His best poetry has been said to be comparable in quality to that of Rupert Brooke. Life Ewart Alan Mackintosh was born on 4 March 1893, the only son of Alexander Mackintosh and his wife, Lilian Rogers. Although he was born in Brighton in Sussex, his father's roots went back to Clan Mackintosh in Alness in Ross. His maternal grandfather was the Calvinist preacher James Guinness Rogers. He said that it was because of his grandfather's friendship with British Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, that he was given his first name. He studied locally at Brighton College whilst also studying Scottish Gaelic and learning to play the Highland war pipes during the holidays. He continued his studies at St Paul's School in London and then studied Classics at Christ Church, Oxford. Mackintosh, who was a member of the University of Oxford Officers' Training Corps, tried to join the army immediately war broke out in August and while still in his university course. He was rejected on the grounds of his poor eyesight. He reapplied and was accepted by the Seaforth Highlanders, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 31 December 1914. He served with the 5th (The Sutherland and Caithness Highland) Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders (a Territorial Force unit), which was part of 51st (Highland) Division. He returned to Britain in August 1915 after being wounded in High Wood on the Somme. He was stationed near Cambridge for eight months during which time he was training cadets and he became engaged to Sylvia Marsh who was from a Quaker family. On 16 May he led a trench raid near Arras where fourteen of his men were wounded and two were killed. One of them, David Sutherland, inspired a poem \\"In Memoriam\\". Mackintosh was now a temporary lieutenant and he received the Military Cross on 24 June 1916. His citation in the London Gazette reads: Mackintosh had been trying to bring Sutherland, who had lost a number of limbs, back to the trenches. Sutherland died of his wounds and had to be left; he has no known burial place, but is commemorated on the Arras Memorial. At the age of 23, Mackintosh regarded himself as a father to his men, and they affectionately called him \\"Tosh\\". Sutherland was a Scot, but many of Mackintosh's other charges were from New Zealand. One of Mackintosh's final poems, Cha Till Maccrimmein, appears to foretell his own death. Mackintosh was killed in action on the second day of the Battle of Cambrai, 21 November 1917, whilst with the 4th Seaforth Highlanders. He was there observing the heavy action near the village of Cantaing. Cambrai was noteworthy in using new tactics including the first mass use of tanks.B. H. Liddell Hart, History of the First World War, Pan Books, 1972: 337 He was buried in the Orival Wood Cemetery near Flesqui√®res in northern France.

If death, I shall die at last, strong in my pride and free.\\" ‚Äì from A Creed His poetry has been said to have been as good as the more famous war poet Rupert Brooke. Lines from his poem \\"A Creed\\" are used on \\"The Call 1914\\"; the Scottish American Memorial in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens when it was installed in 1927. The memorial was paid for by Scottish Americans to commemorate the bravery of the Scottish soldiers of the Great War. A small ceremony took place in France on the 90th anniversary of Mackintosh's death and there were plans to dedicate a chapel to him and his regiment.

Early life Born at Aston Lodge, Watford, Hertfordshire on 18 May 1897, the son of Thomas and Amelia Broad (n√©e Coles), his father was a solicitor; he was educated at St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent. RNAS aviator Broad learned to fly in 1915 at the Hall School of Flying at Hendon. Flying a single-engined Caudron he received Pilot Certificate No. 2,044, after which he joined the Royal Naval Air Service at Eastchurch. After training he was posted to operations with No. 3 Squadron RNAS based at Dunkirk, France flying the Sopwith Pup. Broad was wounded in the neck during one World War I mission escorting bombers and returned to England to become an Instructor whilst he recuperated. For his second operational tour Broad was seconded to No. 46 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps flying the Sopwith Camel. At the end of the Great War, Broad became an instructor at the Fighter Pilots Flying School, Fairlop. Test and sports pilot After leaving the RNAS Broad flew joy-riding aircraft for Avro and in 1920 he flew joy- riding flights in the United States with two Avro seaplanes. In 1921 he came first in the Aerial Derby air race around London, flying a Sopwith Camel. This gained the attention of de Havilland which took him on in October 1921 as chief test pilot at Stag Lane. Given the scarcity of test pilots he was tasked with flying a wide variety of De Havilland aircraft as well as Handley Pages and Glosters. At the 1925 Schneider Trophy Broad was the sole British entrant following a number of pre-race accidents. Flying a Gloster III seaplane he came second to an American Army test pilot called James Doolittle. At de Havilland, Broad undertook many demonstration flights and entered air races and competitions to show off de Havilland aircraft. In 1926 he won the King's Cup Air Race in a de Havilland Moth. In 1928 he took part in the International Light Aircraft Contest in France, finishing in 3rd place. The next year, he came second in the F.A.I. Tourist Plane Contest ‚Äì Challenge International de Tourisme 1929. In the subsequent Challenge International de Tourisme 1930, he was 8th overall (he completed the rally section in 1st place). Krzy≈ºan, Marian. Miƒôdzynarodowe turnieje lotnicze 1929‚Äì1934, Warsaw 1988, In 1935 he left de Havilland to work with the Royal Aircraft Establishment as a test pilot. He published a book in 1939 about flying ‚Äì Flying wisdom; a book of practical experiences and their lessons. In 1940 he returned to industry as chief production test pilot for Hawker Aircraft. He was responsible for test flying the Hawker single-seat fighter planes as they left the production line. He was appointed MBE in 1944 for his work as a Hawker test pilot. Captain Broad died in 1975 at home in Basingstoke; during his career, he completed 7,500 flying hours in 200 different types of aircraft. Sentimental life Broad appears to have had an affair with Beryl Markham, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west; he was named by Mansfield Markham as a co-respondent in his 1937 divorce from Beryl.

This is due to the inevitable accumulation of errors and uncertainties, as well as sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in any realistic flow model. Yet an attracting LCS (such as the unstable manifold of a saddle point) is remarkably robust with respect to modelling errors and uncertainties. LCSs are, therefore, ideal tools for model validation and benchmarking Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are distinguished surfaces of trajectories in a dynamical system that exert a major influence on nearby trajectories over a time interval of interest. The type of this influence may vary, but it invariably creates a coherent trajectory pattern for which the underlying LCS serves as a theoretical centerpiece. In observations of tracer patterns in nature, one readily identifies coherent features, but it is often the underlying structure creating these features that is of interest. As illustrated on the right, individual tracer trajectories forming coherent patterns are generally sensitive with respect to changes in their initial conditions and the system parameters. In contrast, the LCSs creating these trajectory patterns turn out to be robust and provide a simplified skeleton of the overall dynamics of the system. The robustness of this skeleton makes LCSs ideal tools for model validation, model comparison and benchmarking. LCSs can also be used for now-casting and even short-term forecasting of pattern evolution in complex dynamical systems. Physical phenomena governed by LCSs include floating debris, oil spills, surface drifters and chlorophyll patterns in the ocean; clouds of volcanic ash and spores in the atmosphere; and coherent crowd patterns formed by humans and animals. While LCSs generally exist in any dynamical system, their role in creating coherent patterns is perhaps most readily observable in fluid flows.

On a phase space {\\\\mathcal P} and over a time interval {\\\\mathcal I}=[t_0 ,t_1] , consider a non-autonomous dynamical system defined through the flow map F^t_{t_0}\\\\colon x_0 \\\\mapsto x(t,t_0,x_0), mapping initial conditions x_0\\\\in{\\\\mathcal P} into their position x(t,t_0,x_0)\\\\in{\\\\mathcal P} for any time t\\\\in{\\\\mathcal I}. If the flow map F^t_{t_0} is a diffeomorphism for any choice of t\\\\in {\\\\mathcal I}, then for any smooth set {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) of initial conditions in {\\\\mathcal P}, the set : {\\\\mathcal M}=\\\\\\\\{(x,t)\\\\in{\\\\mathcal P} \\\\times {\\\\mathcal I}\\\\,\\\\colon [F^t_{t_0}]^{-1}(x)\\\\in{\\\\mathcal M}(t_0)\\\\\\\\} is an invariant manifold in the extended phase space {\\\\mathcal P} \\\\times {\\\\mathcal I}. Borrowing terminology from fluid dynamics, we refer to the evolving time slice {\\\\mathcal M}(t)= F^t_{t_0}({\\\\mathcal M}(t_0)) of the manifold {\\\\mathcal M} as a material surface (see Fig. 1). Since any choice of the initial condition set {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) yields an invariant manifold {\\\\mathcal M}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal P} \\\\times {\\\\mathcal I}, invariant manifolds and their associated material surfaces are abundant and generally undistinguished in the extended phase space. Only few of them will act as cores of coherent trajectory patterns. = LCSs as exceptional material surfaces = Figure 2a: Hyperbolic LCS (attracting in red and repelling in blue) and elliptic LCS (boundaries of green regions) in a two-dimensional turbulence simulation. (Image: Mohammad Farazmand) In order to create a coherent pattern, a material surface {\\\\mathcal M}(t) should exert a sustained and consistent action on nearby trajectories throughout the time interval {\\\\mathcal I}. Examples of such action are attraction, repulsion, or shear. In principle, any well-defined mathematical property qualifies that creates coherent patterns out of randomly selected nearby initial conditions. Most such properties can be expressed by strict inequalities. For instance, we call a material surface {\\\\mathcal M}(t) attracting over the interval {\\\\mathcal I} if all small enough initial perturbations to {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) are carried by the flow into even smaller final perturbations to {\\\\mathcal M}(t_1). In classical dynamical systems theory, invariant manifolds satisfying such an attraction property over infinite times are called attractors. They are not only special, but even locally unique in the phase space: no continuous family of attractors may exist. In contrast, in dynamical systems defined over a finite time interval {\\\\mathcal I}, strict inequalities do not define exceptional (i.e., locally unique) material surfaces. This follows from the continuity of the flow map F^t_{t_0} over {\\\\mathcal I} . For instance, if a material surface {\\\\mathcal M}(t) attracts all nearby trajectories over the time interval {\\\\mathcal I}, then so will any sufficiently close other material surface. Thus, attracting, repelling and shearing material surfaces are necessarily stacked on each other, i.e., occur in continuous families. This leads to the idea of seeking LCSs in finite-time dynamical systems as exceptional material surfaces that exhibit a coherence-inducing property more strongly than any of the neighboring material surfaces. Such LCSs, defined as extrema (or more generally, stationary surfaces) for a finite-time coherence property, will indeed serve as observed centerpieces of trajectory patterns. Examples of attracting, repelling and shearing LCSs are in a direct numerical simulation of 2D turbulence are shown in Fig.2a. = LCSs vs. classical invariant manifolds = Classical invariant manifolds are invariant sets in the phase space {\\\\mathcal P} of an autonomous dynamical system. In contrast, LCSs are only required to be invariant in the extended phase space. This means that even if the underlying dynamical system is autonomous, the LCSs of the system over the interval I will generally be time-dependent, acting as the evolving skeletons of observed coherent trajectory patterns. Figure 2b shows the difference between an attracting LCS and a classic unstable manifold of a saddle point, for evolving times, in an autonomous dynamical system. Fig. 2b: An attracting LCS is the locally most attracting material line (invariant manifold in the extended phase space of position and time), acting as the backbone curve of deforming tracer patterns over a finite time interval. In contrast, the unstable manifold of a saddle-type fixed point is an invariant curve in the phase space, acting as the asymptotic target for tracer patterns over infinite time intervals. Image: Mohammad Farazmand. = Objectivity of LCSs = Assume that the phase space of the underlying dynamical system is the material configuration space of a continuum, such as a fluid or a deformable body. For instance, for a dynamical system generated by an unsteady velocity field :: v=v(x,t),\\\\qquad x\\\\in U\\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^3, the open set U of possible particle positions is a material configuration space. In this space, LCSs are material surfaces, formed by trajectories. Whether or not a material trajectory is contained in an LCS is a property that is independent of the choice of coordinates, and hence cannot depend of the observer. As a consequence, LCSs are subject to the basic objectivity (material frame- indifference) requirement of continuum mechanics. The objectivity of LCSs requires them to be invariant with respect to all possible observer changes, i.e., linear coordinate changes of the form :: x=Q(t)y+b(t), where y\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^3 is the vector of the transformed coordinates; Q(t) is an arbitrary 3\\\\times 3 proper orthogonal matrix representing time-dependent rotations; and b(t) is an arbitrary 3-dimensional vector representing time- dependent translations. As a consequence, any self-consistent LCS definition or criterion should be expressible in terms of quantities that are frame- invariant. For instance, the strain rate S(x,t) and the spin tensor W(x,t) defined as :: S(x,t)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( abla v(x,t)+ ( abla v(x,t))^T\\\\right),\\\\qquad W(x,t)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( abla v(x,t)- ( abla v(x,t))^T\\\\right), transform under Euclidean changes of frame into the quantities : {\\\\tilde S}(y,t)=Q(t)^TS(x,t)Q(t),\\\\qquad {\\\\tilde W}(y,t)=Q(t)^TS(x,t)Q(t)-Q(t)^T{\\\\dot Q}(t). A Euclidean frame change is, therefore, equivalent to a similarity transform for S(x,t), and hence an LCS approach depending only on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S(x,t) is automatically frame-invariant. In contrast, an LCS approach depending on the eigenvalues of W(x,t) is generally not frame-invariant. A number of frame- independent quantities, such as abla v(x,t), {W}(y,t), abla F^t_{t_0}, as well as the averages or eigenvalues of these quantities, are routinely used in heuristic LCS detection. While such quantities may effectively mark features of the instantaneous velocity field v(x,t), the ability of these quantities to capture material mixing, transport, and coherence is limited and a priori unknown in any given frame. As an example, consider the linear unsteady fluid particle motion : {\\\\dot x}=v(x,t)=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sin{4t} &2+\\\\cos{4t}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -2+\\\\cos{4t}& -\\\\sin{4t} \\\\end{pmatrix}x, which is an exact solution of the two- dimensional Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. The (frame-dependent) Okubo-Weiss criterion classifies the whole domain in this flow as elliptic (vortical) because q=\\\\frac{1}{2}( {\\\\vert S\\\\vert}^2-{\\\\vert W \\\\vert}^2)<0 holds, with \\\\vert\\\\,\\\\cdot \\\\,\\\\vert referring to the Euclidean matrix norm. As seen in Fig. 3, however, trajectories grow exponentially along a rotating line and shrink exponentially along another rotating line. In material terms, therefore, the flow is hyperbolic (saddle-type) in any frame. Figure 3: Instantaneous streamlines and the evolution of trajectories starting from the interior of one of them in a linear solution of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation. This dynamical system is classified as elliptic by a number of frame-dependent coherence diagnostics, such as the Okubo‚ÄìWeiss criterion. (Image: Francisco Beron-Vera) Since Newton‚Äôs equation for particle motion and the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for fluid motion are well known to be frame-dependent, it might first seem counterintuitive to require frame-invariance for LCSs, which are composed of solutions of these frame-dependent equations. Recall, however, that the Newton and Navier‚ÄìStokes equations represent objective physical principles for material particle trajectories. As long as correctly transformed from one frame to the other, these equations generate physically the same material trajectories in the new frame. In fact, we decide how to transform the equations of motion from an x-frame to a y-frame through a coordinate change x=Q(t)y+b(t) precisely by upholding that trajectories are mapped into trajectories, i.e., by requiring x(t)=Q(t)y(t)+b(t) to hold for all times. Temporal differentiation of this identity and substitution into the original equation in the x-frame then yields the transformed equation in the y-frame. While this process adds new terms (inertial forces) to the equations of motion, these inertial terms arise precisely to ensure the invariance of material trajectories. Fully composed of material trajectories, LCSs remain invariant in the transformed equation of motion defined in the y-frame of reference. Consequently, any self-consistent LCS definition or detection method must also be frame-invariant.  Hyperbolic LCSs  Figure 4. Attracting and repelling LCSs in the extended phase space of a two-dimensional dynamical system. Motivated by the above discussion, the simplest way to define an attracting LCS is by requiring it to be a locally strongest attracting material surface in the extended phase space {\\\\mathcal P} \\\\times {\\\\mathcal I} (see. Fig. 4) . Similarly, a repelling LCS can be defined as a locally strongest repelling material surface. Attracting and repelling LCSs together are usually referred to as hyperbolic LCSs, as they provide a finite- time genearalization of the classic concept of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in dynamical systems. = Diagnostic approach: Finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) ridges = Heuristically, one may seek initial positions {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0 ) of repelling LCSs as set of initial conditions at which infinitesimal perturbations to trajectories starting from {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0 ) grow locally at the highest rate relative to trajectories starting off of {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0 ). The heuristic element here is that instead of constructing a highly repelling material surface, one simply seeks points of large particle separation. Such a separation may well be due to strong shear along the set of points so identified; this set is not at all guaranteed to exert any normal repulsion on nearby trajectories. The growth of an infinitesimal perturbation {\\\\xi}(t) along a trajectory x(t,t_0 ,x_0) is governed by the flow map gradient abla F^t_{t_0}. Let \\\\epsilon{\\\\xi}(t_0) be a small perturbation to the initial condition x_0, with 0<\\\\epsilon\\\\ll 1, and with {\\\\xi}(t_0) denoting an arbitrary unit vector in {\\\\mathbb R}^n. This perturbation generally grows along the trajectory x(t,t_0 ,x_0) into the perturbation vector {\\\\xi}_\\\\epsilon(t_1;x_0)= abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)\\\\epsilon{\\\\xi}(t_0). Then the maximum relative stretching of infinitesimal perturbations at the point x_0 can be computed as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\delta^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0) & =\\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\to0}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\max_{\\\\left\\\\xi(t_{0})\\\\right=1}\\\\left\\\\xi_{\\\\epsilon}(t_{1};x_{0})\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\max_{\\\\left\\\\xi(t_{0})\\\\right=1}\\\\sqrt{\\\\left\\\\langle abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\\\\xi(t_{0}), abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\\\\xi(t_{0})\\\\right\\\\rangle } \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\max_{\\\\left\\\\xi(t_{0})\\\\right=1}\\\\sqrt{\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\xi(t_{0}),C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\\\\xi(t_{0})\\\\right\\\\rangle } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where C^{t_1}_{t_0}=\\\\left[ abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\\\\right]^T abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} denotes the right Cauchy‚ÄìGreen strain tensor. One then concludes that the maximum relative stretching experienced along a trajectory starting from x_0 is just \\\\delta^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_n (x_0)} . As this relative stretching tends to grow rapidly, it is more convenient to work with its growth exponent (\\\\log{\\\\delta^{t_1}_{t_0 }})/(t_1-t_0), which is then precisely the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) : \\\\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})=\\\\frac{1}{2(t_{1}-t_{0})}\\\\log\\\\lambda_{n}(x_{0}). Figure 5a. Attracting (red) and repelling (blue) LCSs extracted as FTLE ridges from a two-dimensional turbulence experiment (Image: Manikandan Mathur) Therefore, one expects hyperbolic LCSs to appear as codimension-one local maximizing surfaces (or ridges) of the FTLE field. This expectation turns out to be justified in the majority of cases: time t_0 positions of repelling LCSs are marked by ridges of \\\\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0}). By applying the same argument in backward time, we obtain that time t_1 positions of attracting LCSs are marked by ridges of the backward FTLE field \\\\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{1}}^{t_{0}}. The classic way of computing Lyapunov exponents is solving a linear differential equation for the linearized flow map abla F^{t}_{t_0}(x_0). A more expedient approach is to compute the FTLE field from a simple finite-difference approximation to the deformation gradient. For example, in a three-dimenisonal flow, we launch a trajectory x(t;t_0,x_0) from any element x_0 of a grid of initial conditions. Using the coordinate representation x=(x^1,x^2,x^3) for the evolving trajectory x(t;t_0,x_0), we approximate the gradient of the flow map as : abla F_{t_{0}}^{t}(x_{0})\\\\approx \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{1})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{1})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{1}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{2})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{2})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{2}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{3})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{3})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{3}\\\\right}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{1})-x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{1})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{1}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{2})-x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{2})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{2}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{3})-x^{2}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{3})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{3}\\\\right}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{1})-x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{1})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{1}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{2})-x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{2})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{2}\\\\right} & \\\\frac{x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\\\\delta_{3})-x^{3}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\\\\delta_{3})}{\\\\left2\\\\delta_{3}\\\\right} \\\\end{pmatrix} , Figure 5b. Attracting (blue) and repelling (red) LCSs extracted as FTLE ridges from a two-dimensional simulation of a von Karman vortex street (Image: Jens Kasten) with a small vector \\\\delta_{i} pointing in the x^{i} coordinate direction. For two-dimensional flows, only the first 2\\\\times 2 minor matrix of the above matrix is relevant. Figure 6. FTLE ridges highlight both hyperbolic LCS and shearing material lines, such as the boundaries of a riverbed in a 3D model of the New River Inlet, Onslow, North Carolina (Image: Allen Sanderson). Issues with inferring hyperbolic LCSs from FTLE ridges FTLE ridges have proven to be a simple and efficient tool for the visualize hyperbolic LCSs in a number of physical problems, yielding intriguing images of initial positions of hyperbolic LCSs in different applications (see, e.g., Figs. 5a-b). However, FTLE ridges obtained over sliding time windows [t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T] do not form material surfaces. Thus, ridges of \\\\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}+T}^{t_{1}+T}(x_{0}) under varying T cannot be used to define Lagrangian objects, such as hyperbolic LCSs. Indeed, a locally strongest repelling material surface over [t_{0},t_{1}] will generally not play the same role over [t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T] and hence its evolving position at time t_0+T will not be a ridge for \\\\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}+T}^{t_{1}+T}. Nonetheless, evolving second-derivative FTLE ridges computed over sliding intervals of the form [t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T] have been identified by some authors broadly with LCSs. In support of this identification, it is also often argued that the material flux over such sliding-window FTLE ridges should necessarily be small. The \\"FTLE ridge=LCS\\" identification, however, suffers form the following conceptual and mathematical problems: * Second-derivative FTLE ridges are necessarily straight lines and hence do not exist in physical problems. * FTLE ridges computed over sliding time windows [t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T] with a varying T are generally not Lagrangian and the flux through them is generally not small. * In particular, a broadly referenced material flux formula for FTLE ridges is incorrect, even for straight FTLE ridges * FTLE ridges mark hyperbolic LCS positions, but also highlight surfaces of high shear. A convoluted mixture of both types of surfaces often arises in applications (see Fig. 6 for an example). * There are several other types LCSs (elliptic and parabolic) beyond the hyperbolic LCSs highlighted by FTLE ridges = Local variational approach: Shrink and stretch surfaces = The local variational theory of hyperbolic LCSs builds on their original definition as strongest repelling or repelling material surfaces in the flow over the time interval [t_0,t_1]. At an initial point x_{0} , let n_{0} denote a unit normal to an initial material surface \\\\mathcal{M}(t_{0}) (cf. Fig. 6). By the invariance of material lines, the tangent space T_{x_0}\\\\mathcal{M}(t_{0}) is mapped into the tangent space of T_{x_1}\\\\mathcal{M}(t_{1}) by the linearized flow map abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0}). At the same time, the image of the normal n_0 normal under abla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0}) generally does not remain normal to \\\\mathcal{M}(t_{1}). Therefore, in addition to a normal component of length \\\\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0,}n_{0}), the advected normal also develops a tangential component of length \\\\sigma^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0}) (cf. Fig. 7). Figure 7. Linearized flow geometry along an evolving material surface. If \\\\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})>1, then the evolving material surface \\\\mathcal{M}(t) strictly repels nearby trajectories by the end of the time interval [t_0,t_1]. Similarly, \\\\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})<1 signals that \\\\mathcal{M}(t) strictly attracts nearby trajectories along its normal directions. A repelling (attracting) LCS over the interval [t_0,t_1] can be defined as a material surface \\\\mathcal{M}(t) whose net repulsion \\\\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0}) is pointwise maximal (minimal) with respect to perturbations of the initial normal vector field n_{0}. As earlier, we refer to repelling and attracting LCSs collectively as hyperbolic LCSs. Solving these local extremum principles for hyperbolic LCSs in two and three dimensions yields unit normal vector fields to which hyperbolic LCSs should everywhere be tangent. The existence of such normal surfaces also requires a Frobenius-type integrability condition in the three-dimensional case. All these results can be summarized as follows: { align=\\"center\\"  border=\\"1\\" + Hyperbolic LCS conditions from local variational theory in dimensions n=2 and n=3 ! scope=\\"col\\"  LCS ! scope=\\"col\\"  Normal vector field of {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=2,3 ! scope=\\"col\\"  ODE for {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=2 ! scope=\\"col\\"  Frobenius-type PDE for {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=3 - style=\\"text- align: center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Attracting  \\\\xi_1 (x_0)  x^{\\\\prime}_0 =\\\\xi_2(x_0) (stretch lines)  \\\\left\\\\langle abla\\\\times\\\\xi_{1}(x_0),\\\\xi_{1}(x_0)\\\\right\\\\rangle =0 (stretch surfaces) - style=\\"text-align: center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Repelling  \\\\xi_n (x_0)  x^{\\\\prime}_0 =\\\\xi_1(x_0) (shrink lines)  \\\\left\\\\langle abla\\\\times\\\\xi_{3}(x_0),\\\\xi_{3}(x_0)\\\\right\\\\rangle =0 (shrink surfaces) } Repelling LCSs are obtained as most repelling shrink lines, starting from local maxima of \\\\lambda_2 (x_0). Attracting LCSs are obtained as most attracting stretch lines, starting from local minima of \\\\lambda_1 (x_0). These starting points serve are initial positions of exceptional saddle-type trajectories in the flow. An example of the local variational computation of a repelling LCS is shown in FIg. 8. The computational algorithm is available in LCS Tool. Figure 8. A repelling LCS visualized as an FTLE ridge (left) and computed exactly as a shrink line (right), i.e., a solution of the ODE x^{\\\\prime}_0 =\\\\xi_1(x_0) starting from a global maximum of \\\\lambda_2 (x_0). (Image: Mohammad Farazmand) In 3D flows, instead of solving the Frobenius PDE (see table above) for hyperbolic LCSs, an easier approach is to construct intersections of hyperbolic LCSs with select 2D planes, and fit a surface numerically to a large number of such intersection curves. Let us denote the unit normal of a 2D plane \\\\Pi by n_\\\\Pi. The intersection curve of a 2D repelling LCS surface with the plane \\\\Pi is normal to both n_\\\\Pi and to the unit normal \\\\xi_3(x_{0}) of the LCS. As a consequence, an intersection curve x_0(s) satisfies the ODE : x^{\\\\prime}_0 =\\\\xi_3(x_{0})\\\\times n_\\\\Pi, whose trajectories we refer to as reduced shrink lines. (Strictly speaking, this equation is not an ordinary differential equation, given that its right-hand side is not a vector field, but a direction field, which is generally not globally orientable). Intersections of hyperbolic LCSs with \\\\Pi are fastest contracting reduced shrink lines. Determining such shrink lines in a smooth family of nearby \\\\Pi planes, then fitting a surface to the curve family so obtained yields a numerical approximation of a 2D repelling LCS. = Global variational approach: Shrink- and stretchlines as null-geodesics = A general material surface experiences shear and strain in its deformation, both of which depend continuously on initial conditions by the continuity of the map F^t_{t_0}. The averaged strain and shear within a strip of {\\\\mathcal O}(\\\\epsilon)-close material lines, therefore, typically show {\\\\mathcal O}(\\\\epsilon) variation within such a strip. The two-dimensional geodesic theory of LCSs seeks exceptionally coherent locations where this general trend fails, resulting in an order of magnitude smaller variability in shear or strain than what is normally expected across an {\\\\mathcal O}(\\\\epsilon) strip. Specifically, the geodesic theory searches for LCSs as special material lines around which {\\\\mathcal O}(\\\\epsilon) material strips show no {\\\\mathcal O}(\\\\epsilon) variability either in the material-line averaged shear (Shearless LCSs) or in the material-line averaged strain (Strainless or Elliptic LCSs). Such LCSs turn out to be null-geodesics of appropriate metric tensors defined by the deformation field‚Äîhence the name of this theory. Shearless LCSs are found to be null-geodesics of a Lorentzian metric tensor D_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} defined as :D_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\\\\Omega-\\\\Omega C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\\\\right],\\\\qquad \\\\Omega= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} . Such null-geodesics can be proven to be tensorlines of the Cauchy‚ÄìGreen strain tensor, i.e., are tangent to the direction field formed by the strain eigenvector fields \\\\xi_i(x_0). Specifically, repelling LCSs are trajectories of x_{0}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\xi_{1}(x_{0}) starting from local maxima of the \\\\lambda_2(x_0) eigenvalue field. Similarly, attracting LCSs are trajectories of x_{0}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\xi_{2}(x_{0}) starting from local minims of the \\\\lambda_1(x_0) eigenvalue field. This agrees with the conclusion of the local variational theory of LCSs. The geodesic approach, however, also sheds more light on the robustness of hyperbolic LCSs: hyperbolic LCSs only prevail as stationary curves of the averaged shear functional under variations that leave their endpoints fixed. This is to be contrasted with parabolic LCSs (see below), which are also shearless LCSs but prevail as stationary curves to the shear functional even under arbitrary variations. As a consequence, individual trajectories are objective, and statements about the coherent structures they form should also be objective. A sample application is shown in Fig. 9, where the sudden appearance of a hyperbolic core (strongest attracting part of a stretchline) within the oil spill caused the notable Tiger-Tail instability in the shape of the oil spill.  Elliptic LCSs  Elliptc LCSs are closed and nested material surfaces that act as building blocks of the Lagrangian equivalents of vortices, i.e., rotation-dominated regions of trajectories that generally traverse the phase space without substantial stretching or folding. They mimic the behavior of Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold‚ÄìMoser (KAM) tori that form elliptic regions in Hamiltonian systems. There coherence can be approached either through their homogeneous material rotation or through their homogeneous stretching properties. = Rotational coherence from the polar rotation angle (PRA) = As a simplest approach to rotational coherence, one may define an elliptic LCS as a tubular material surface along which small material volumes complete the same net rotation over the time intervall [t_0 ,t_1] of interest. A challenge in that in each material volume element, all individual material fibers (tangent vectors to trajectories) perform different rotations. To obtain a well-defined bulk rotation for each material element, one may employ the unique left and right polar decompositions of the flow gradient in the form : abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}=R^{t_1}_{t_0}U^{t_1}_{t_0}=V^{t_1}_{t_0}R^{t_1}_{t_0}, where the proper orthogonal tensor R^{t_1}_{t_0} is called the rotation tensor and the symmetric, positive definite tensors U^{t_1}_{t_0},V^{t_1}_{t_0} are called the left stretch tensor and right stretch tensor, respectively. Since the Cauchy‚ÄìGreen strain tensor can be written as : C^{t_1}_{t_0}=[ abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}]^T abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}=U^{t_1}_{t_0}U^{t_1}_{t_0}=V^{t_1}_{t_0}V^{t_1}_{t_0}, the local material straining described by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of C^{t_1}_{t_0} are fully captured by the singular values and singular vectors of the stretch tensors. The remaining factor in the deformation gradient is represented by R^{t_1}_{t_0}, interpreted as the bulk solid-body rotation component of volume elements. In planar motions, this rotation is defined relative to the normal of the plane. In three dimensions, the rotation is defined relative to the axis defined by the eigenvector of R^{t_1}_{t_0} corresponding to its unit eigenvalue. In higher-dimensional flows, the rotation tensor cannot be viewed as a rotation about a single axis. Figure 10a. Elliptic LCSs revealed by closed level curves of the PRA distribution in a two-dimensional turbulence simulation. (Image: Mohammad Farazmand) Figure 10b. Elliptic LCSs revealed by closed level curves of the PRA distribution in the steady ABC flow. (Image: Mohammad Farazmand) In two and three dimensions, therefore, there exists a polar rotation angle (PRA) \\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}(x_0) that characterises the material rotation generated by R^{t_1}_{t_0} for a volume element centered at the initial condition x_0. This PRA is well-defined up to multiples of 2\\\\pi. For two-dimensional flows, the PRA can be computed from the invariants of C^{t_1}_{t_0} using the formulas : \\\\begin{align} \\\\cos\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}&=\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\xi_{i}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{i}\\\\rangle }{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{i}}},\\\\quad i=1\\\\,\\\\,or\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}&=\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{j}\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\xi_{i}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{j}\\\\rangle }{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{j}}},\\\\qquad (i,j)=(1,2)\\\\,\\\\,or\\\\,\\\\,(2,1),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} which yield a four-quadrant version of the PRA via the formula : \\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}=\\\\left[1-{\\\\rm sign\\\\,}\\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\pi+{\\\\rm sign\\\\,}\\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\right)\\\\cos^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\right). For three-dimensional flows, the PRA can again be computed from the invariants of C^{t_1}_{t_0} from the formulas : \\\\begin{align} \\\\cos\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}&=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\xi_{i}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{i}\\\\right\\\\rangle }{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{i}}}-1\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t} &=\\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\xi_{i}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle -\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\xi_{j}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{i}\\\\right\\\\rangle }{2\\\\epsilon_{ijk}e_{k}},\\\\qquad i eq j, \\\\end{align} where \\\\epsilon_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol, \\\\mathbf{e}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ e_{k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is the eigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvector of the matrix \\\\left[K_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\right]_{jk}=\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\xi_{j}, abla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\\\\xi_{k}\\\\right\\\\rangle/{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{k}}}. The time t_0 positions of elliptic LCSs are visualized as tubular level sets of the PRA distribution \\\\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}. In two-dimensions, therefore, (polar) elliptic LCSs are simply closed level curves of the PRA, which turn out to be objective. In three dimensions, (polar) elliptic LCSs are toroidal or cylindrical level surfaces of the PRA, which are, however, not objective and hence will generally change in rotating frames. Coherent Lagrangian vortex boundaries can be visualized as outermost members of nested families of elliptic LCSs. Two- and three-dimensional examples of elliptic LCS revealed by tubular level surfaces of the PRA are shown in Fig. 10a-b. = Rotational coherence from the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation (LAVD) = The level sets of the PRA are objective in two dimensions but not in three dimensions. An additional shortcoming of the polar rotation tensor is its dynamical inconsistency: polar rotations computed over adjacent sub-intervals of a total deformation do not sum up to the rotation computed for the full- time interval of the same deformation. Therefore, while R_{t_{0}}^{t_1} is the closest rotation tensor to abla F^{t_1}_{t_0} in the L^2 norm over a fixed time interval [t_0,t_1] , these piecewise best fits do not form a family of rigid-body rotations as t_0 and ,t_1 are varied. For this reason, rotations predicted by the polar rotation tensor over varying time intervals divert from the experimentally observed mean material rotation of fluid elements. 400pxthumbFigure 11a: Rotationally coherent mesoscale eddy boundaries in the ocean at time t0 = November 11, 2006, identified from satellite-based surface velocities, using the integration time t1-t0=90 days. The boundaries are identified as outermost closed contours of the LAVD with small convexity deficiency. Also shown in the background is the contour plot of the LAVD field for reference. (Image: Alireza Hadjighasem) Figure 11b: Materially advected rotationally coherent mesoscale eddy boundaries and eddy centers in the ocean, along with representative inertial particle trajectories initialised on the eddy boundaries. The eddy centers are obtained as local maxima of the LAVD field. As can be proven mathematically, heavy particles (cyan) converge to the centers of anti-cyclonic (clockwise) eddies. Light particles (black) converge to the centers of cyclonic (clockwise) eddies. (Movie: Alireza Hadjighasem) An alternative to the classic polar decomposition provides a resolution to both the non-objectivity and the dynamic inconsistency issue. Specifically, the Dynamic Polar Decomposition (DPD) of the deformation gradient is also of the form : abla F^{t}_{t_0}=O_{t_{0}}^{t}M_{t_{0}}^{t}=N_{t_{0}}^{t}O_{t_{0}}^{t}, where the proper orthogonal tensor O^{t}_{t_0} is the dynamic rotation tensor and the non-singular tensors M^{t}_{t_0},N^{t}_{t_0} are the left dynamic stretch tensor and right dynamic stretch tensor, respectively. Just as the classic polar decomposition, the DPD is valid in any finite dimension. Unlike the classic polar decomposition, however, the dynamic rotation and stretch tensors are obtained from solving linear differential equations, rather than from matrix manipulations. In particular, O_{t_{0}}^{t}= abla_{a_{0}}a(t) is the deformation gradient of the purely rotational flow : \\\\dot{a}=W\\\\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\\\\right)a, and M_{t_{0}}^{t}= abla_{b_{0}}b(t) is the deformation gradient of the purely straining flow : \\\\dot{b}=O_{t}^{t_{0}}S\\\\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\\\\right)O_{t_{0}}^{t}b. . The dynamic rotation tensor O_{t_{0}}^{t} can further be factorized into two deformation gradients: one for a spatially uniform (rigid-body) rotation, and one that deviates from this uniform rotation: : O_{t_{0}}^{t}=\\\\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\Theta_{t_{0}}^{t}. As a spatially independent rigid-body rotation, the proper orthogonal relative rotation tensor \\\\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}=\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha_{0}}\\\\alpha(t) is dynamically consistent, serving as the deformation gradient of the relative rotation flow : \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}=\\\\left[W\\\\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\\\\right)-\\\\bar{W}\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\alpha. In contrast, the proper orthogonal mean rotation tensor \\\\Theta_{t_{0}}^{t}=D_{\\\\beta_{0}}\\\\beta(t) is the deformation gradient of the mean-rotation flow : \\\\dot{\\\\beta}=\\\\Phi_{t}^{t_{0}}\\\\bar{W}\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}\\\\beta. The dynamic consistency of \\\\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t} implies that the total angle swept by \\\\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t} around its own axis of rotation is dynamically consistent. This intrinsic rotation angle \\\\psi_{t_{0}}^{t}(x_{0}) is also objective, and turns out to equal to one half of the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation (LAVD). The LAVD is defined as the trajectory-averaged magnitude of the deviation of the vorticity from its spatial mean. With the vorticity \\\\omega (x,t)= abla\\\\times v(x,t) and its spatial mean : \\\\bar{\\\\omega}(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\int_{U(t)}\\\\omega(x,t)\\\\,dV}{\\\\mathrm{vol}\\\\,(U(t))}, the LAVD over a time interval [t_0,t_1] therefore takes the form : \\\\mathrm{LAVD}_{t_{0}}^{t_1}(x_{0}):=\\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_1}\\\\left\\\\omega(x(s;x_{0}),s)-\\\\bar{\\\\omega}(s)\\\\right\\\\,ds, with U(t) denoting the (possibly time-varying) domain of definition of the velocity field v(x,t) . This result applies both in two- and three dimensions, and enables the computation of a well-defined, objective and dynamically consistent material rotation angle along any trajectory. 350pxrightthumbFigure 11c: A rotationally coherent mesoscale eddy (yellow) in the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) ocean model at t0 = May 15, 2006, computed as a tubular LAVD level surface over t1-t0=120 days. Also shown are nearby LAVD level surfaces to illustrate the rotational incoherence outside the eddy. (Image: Alireza Hadjighasem) Outermost complex tubular level curves of the LAVD define initial positions of rotationally coherent material vortex boundaries in two-dimensional unsteady flows (see Fig. 11a). By construction, these boundaries may exhibit transverse filamentation, but any developing filament keeps rotating with the boundary, without global transverse departure form the material vortex. (Exceptions are inviscid flows where such a global departure of LAVD level surfaces from a vortex is possible as fluid elements preserve their material rotation rate for all times). Remarkably, centers of rotationally coherent vortices (defined by local maxima of the LAVD field) can be proven to be the observed centers of attraction or repulsion for finite- size (inertial) particle motion in geophysical flows (see Fig. 11b). In three- dimensional flows, tubular level surfaces of the LAVD define initial positions of two-dimensional eddy boundary surfaces (see Fig. 11c) that remain rotationally coherent over a time intcentererval [t_0,t_1] (see Fig. 11d). Fig. 11c Material advection of a rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortex and its core in the 3D SOSE model data set. (Animation: Alireza Hadjighasem) = Stretching-based coherence from a local variational approach: Shear surfaces = The local variational theory of elliptic LCSs targets material surfaces that locally maximize material shear over the finite time interval [t_0,t_1] of interest. This means that at initial point each point x_0\\\\in{\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) of an elliptic LCS {\\\\mathcal M}(t), the tangent space T_{x_0}{\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) is the plane along which the local Lagrangian shear \\\\sigma^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0) is maximal (cf. Fig 7). Introducing the two- dimensional shear vector field : \\\\eta^{\\\\pm}(x_{0}):=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-1}{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\\\\xi_{1}(x_{0})\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\\\\xi_{2}(x_{0}), and the three-dimensional shear normal vector field :n_{\\\\pm}(x_{0})=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}}\\\\xi_{1}(x_{0})\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}}\\\\xi_{3}(x_{0}), the criteria for two- and three-dimensional elliptic LCSs can be summarized as follows: { align=\\"center\\"  border=\\"1\\" +Ellipitic LCS conditions from local variational theory in dimensions n=2 and n=3 ! scope=\\"col\\"  LCS ! scope=\\"col\\"  Normal vector field of {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=3 ! scope=\\"col\\"  ODE for {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=2 ! scope=\\"col\\"  Frobenius-type PDE for {\\\\mathcal M}(t_0) for n=3 - style=\\"text-align: center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Elliptic  n_{\\\\pm}(x_{0})  x^{\\\\prime}_0 =\\\\eta^{\\\\pm}(x_{0}) (shear lines)  \\\\langle abla\\\\times n_{\\\\pm}(x_0),n_{\\\\pm}(x_0)\\\\rangle =0 (shear surfaces) } For 3D flows, as in the case of hyperbolic LCSs, solving the Frobenius PDE can be avoided. Instead, one can construct intersections of a tubular elliptic LCS with select 2D planes, and fit a surface numerically to a large number of these intersection curves. As for hyperbolic LCSs above, let us denote the unit normal of a 2D plane \\\\Pi by n_\\\\Pi. Again, the intersection curves of elliptic LCSs with the plane \\\\Pi are normal to both n_\\\\Pi and to the unit normal n_{\\\\pm}(x_{0}) of the LCS. As a consequence, an intersection curve x_0(s) satisfies the reduced shear ODE : x^{\\\\prime}_0 =n_{\\\\pm}(x_{0})\\\\times n_\\\\Pi, whose trajectories we refer to as reduced shear lines. (Strictly speaking, the reduced shear ODE is not an ordinary differential equation, given that its right-hand side is not a vector field, but a direction field, which is generally not globally orientable). Intersections of tubular elliptic LCSs with \\\\Pi are limit cycles of the reduced shear ODE. Determining such limit cycles in a smooth family of nearby \\\\Pi planes, then fitting a surface to the limit cycle family yields a numerical approximation for 2D shear surface. A three-dimensional example of this local variational computation of an elliptic LCS is shown in Fig. 11. Figure 11: An elliptic Lagrangian Coherent Structure (or LCS, in green, on the left) and its advected position under the flow map (on the right) of a chaotically forced ABC flow. Also shown in green is a circle of initial conditions placed around the LCS (on the left), advected for the same amount of time (on the right). Image: Daniel Blazevski. = Stretching-based coherence from a global variational approach: lambda-lines = Figure 13. Nested family of elliptic LCSs, obtained as \\\\lambda-lines, forming transport barriers around the Great Red Spot (GRS) of Jupiter. These LCSs were identified in a two-dimensional, unsteady velocity field reconstructed from a video footage of Jupiter. The color indicates the corresponding values of the parameter \\\\lambda. Also shown is the perfectly coherent (\\\\lambda=1-line) bounding the core of the GRS, as well as the outermost elliptic LCS serving as the Lagrangian vortex boundary of the GRS. Image:Alireza Hadjighasem. As noted above under hyperbolic LCSs, a global variational approach has been developed in two dimensions to capture elliptic LCSs as closed stationary curves of the material-line-averaged Lagrangian strain functional. Such curves turn out to be closed null-geodesics of the generalized Green‚ÄìLagrange strain tensor family \\\\frac{1}{2}(C^{t_1}_{t_0}-\\\\lambda I), where \\\\lambda >0 is a positive parameter (Lagrange multiplier). The closed null-geodesics can be shown to coincide with limit cycles of the family of direction fields \\\\eta^{\\\\pm}_\\\\lambda(x_{0}):=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\\\\lambda^2}{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\\\\xi_{1}(x_{0})\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}{\\\\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\\\\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\\\\xi_{2}(x_{0}), Note that for \\\\lambda =1, the direction field \\\\eta^{\\\\pm}_\\\\lambda(x_{0} coincides with the direction field \\\\eta^{\\\\pm}(x_{0} for shearlines obtained above from the local variational theory of LCSs. Trajectories of \\\\eta^{\\\\pm}_\\\\lambda are referred to as \\\\lambda-lines. Remarkably, they are initial positions of material lines that are infinitesimally uniformly stretching under the flow map F^{t_1}_{t_0}. Specifically, any subset of a \\\\lambda-line is stretched by a factor of \\\\lambda between the times t_0 and t_1. As an example, Fig. 13 shows elliptic LCSs identified as closed \\\\lambda- lines within the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.  Parabolic LCSs  Parabolic LCSs are shearless material surfaces that delineate cores of jet-type sets of trajectories. Such LCSs are characterized by both low stretching (because they are inside a non-stretching structure), but also by low shearing (because material shearing is minimal in jet cores). = Diagnostic approach: Finite- time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) trenches = Since both shearing and stretching are as low as possible along a parabolic LCS, one may seek initial positions of such material surfaces as trenches of the FTLE field FTLE^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0). A geophysical example of a parabolic LCS (generalized jet core) revealed as a trench of the FTLE field is shown in Fig. 14a. = Global variational approach: Heteroclinic chains of null-geodesics = In two dimensions, parabolic LCSs are also solutions of the global shearless variational principle described above for hyperbolic LCSs. As such, parabolic LCSs are composed of shrink lines and stretch lines that represent geodesics of the Lorentzian metric tensor D^{t_1}_{t_0}. In contrast to hyperbolic LCSs, however, parabolic LCSs satisfy more robust boundary conditions: they remain stationary curves of the material-line-averaged shear functional even under variations to their endpoints. This explains the high degree of robustness and observability that jet cores exhibit in mixing. This is to be contrasted with the highly sensitive and fading footprint of hyperbolic LCSs away from strongly hyperbolic regions in diffusive tracer patterns. Under variable endpoint boundary conditions, initial positions of parabolic LCSs turn out to be alternating chains of shrink lines and stretch lines that connect singularities of these line fields. These singularities occur at points where \\\\lambda_1(x_0)=\\\\lambda_2(x_0), and hence no infinitesimal deformation takes place between the two time instances t_0 and t_1. Fig. 14b shows an example of parabolic LCSs in Jupiter's atmosphere, located using this variational theory. The chevron-type shapes forming out of circular material blobs positioned along the jet core is characteristic of tracer deformation near parabolic LCSs. Figure 14b: Parabolic LCSs delineating unsteady Lagrangian jet cores in the atmosphere of Jupiter. Also shown is the evolution of the elliptic LCS marking the boundary of the Great Red Spot.

He studied at Sydney Art School from 1911 under Julian Ashton and Elioth Gruner. In 1916, Feint enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces, and was sent to France with the 15th Field Ambulance. Before being demobbed in 1919, he was granted three months leave to study at the Acad√©mie Julien in Paris. He studied plate etching from 1922 to 1926; woodblock-engraving from 1926 to 1928, with assistance from Thea Proctor in 1927; and oil painting beginning in 1938, with Margaret Preston. Artwork The Home Journal cover He was co-director (with bookbinder Wal Taylor) and manager of Grosvenor Gallery, Sydney, from 1924‚Äì28. Exhibitors included the now-famous Thea Proctor, Elioth Gruner, Margaret Preston, Roland Wakelin, Roy De Maistre and George Washington Lambert. He was employed as assistant editor (to Sydney Ure Smith) of Art in Australia from 1928‚Äì40, contributing many cover illustrations to this and filling many commissions for his advertising agency Smith and Julius. Between 1927 and 1939, Feint made 18 covers for Ure Smith's magazine The Home, including the famous illustration on the October 1928 issue in collaboration with Hera Roberts. He abandoned graphic arts around 1939 (he reworked one bookplate in 1944) to work as a bookbinder with Benjamin Waite and to illustrate limited edition books.

It is located at Kulamangalam in Alangudi Taluk. Kulamangalam Kuthirai (The Horse Idol)  History  The temples history is dated back to 18th century. The exact year in which the temple is constructed is not known. The temple is currently maintained by the Tamil Nadu State Government. Like in many Ayyanar temples, this temple also located in the border of the village as a means of securing and assuring wealth and health for all. The temple is in the bank of Villuni River.  An elephant idol facing opposite the horse idol As per the researchers, there used to be a big Elephant idol facing opposite to the Horse idol in this Temple. This was considered one of the significance of this Temple, since it is very rare practice to construct an Elephant idol in an Ayyanar (The Horse) Temple that too facing opposite of the Horse idol. It was learned that during one of the heavy monsoon season, the flood in the Villuni River had completely destroyed the Elephant idol thus by leaving only the base of the Elephant idol. This temple take in Tamil Nadu government .  Worlds biggest horse idol  The Horse Idol is of mammoth 37 feet height with the front legs are in the Air and the others in the ground. The Idol is facing the South side. It's one of the finest creative of the ancient Tamilians. The structure is so unique in its construction and Devotees believe that it is the biggest Horse idol in the world.  Masi Magam festival  As in many other temples in the Tamil Nadu, a two days grant festival is celerabted during Masi Magam or Masi Makam (It is one of the most important Tamil Hindu festival celebrated in the Tamil month of Masi, February ‚Äì March by Tamilians). Devotees from the nearby villages and from various part of the State gather in thousands on these days to workship the Ayyanar and get his blessings. Though there are regular Pujas in the temple, considerable number of devotees visit on Monday and Friday of every week throughout the year.  Garland decorations On these festival days, garland as big as the height of the Horse Idol wore to it by Devotees who had it as a promise upon realising their prayers. These garland are not made by natural flowers since it takes up to a week for a person to thread a one. The agents who specialised in making this huge garlands start advertising and accepting the orders two/three months before the festival itself. This is a custom found nowhere else in the world. Every year there would be minimum more than 1000 garland, hence leaving only the Horse nose visible. Separate iron rods are built to hang the garland, thus by protecting the idol not damaged by the heavy weight.  Renovation 2010  A view of Devotees on 22, May 2010 The Temple is recently renovated by contributions from devotees and it was initiated by the former Alangudi MLA Mr. A. Venkatachalam along with support of the village people. A new Temple Mandapam is constructed to add to the beauty of ancient Kuthirai (The Horse) which also got re-painted as part this. After the renovation, the Maha Kumbhabhishekam happened on 22, May 2010.

It lies on the Ramberg massif within the boundaries of Gernrode, a part of Quedlinburg, and about 3 kilometres northeast of Friedrichsbrunn.  History  The first hunting lodge on the Viktorsh√∂he had been built next to a small well house at the behest of Prince Victor Frederick in 1750. And the first observation tower here also appeared as early as the 18th century. In 1892 a building on the Viktorsh√∂he had become a popular pub catering for day trippers. In 1897 a 20-metre-high tower was built, made from oak logs, from which there were views as far as the Kyffh√§user. In 1927 the forestry authority, who had the right to sell wine and beer from their lodge, was disbanded. The last foresters were recorded as Messrs. Jacobi and Sachtler. The property, however, continued to be managed and extended. In 1946 the Anhalt governor, Heinrich Deist senior, stayed at the Viktorsh√∂he Guest House. He was witness to a night-time raid on the pub on 14 July 1946 perpetrated by three Soviet soldiers. The owner of the Viktorsh√∂he received stab wounds to his back and was hit with a revolver. Six hundred Reichsmarks were stolen, together with a radio and clothing. Even the guests were robbed. Until 1958, Saalmann was the publican of the Viktorsh√∂he. In 1959 the Viktorsh√∂he became a works holiday home and was close to the public as a result. At the end of the 1970s the building complex became a company holiday home for the Draht- und Seilwerke Rothenburg (Rothenburg Wire and Cable Company). The next-door restaurant was a favourite walking and excursion halt. In 1990 the guest house was closed.. The buildings on the Viktorsh√∂he became empty during the 1990s and are gradually falling into ruin. The remaining furniture lies scattered about the area and gives an impression of destruction and neglect, reminiscent of war. Near the summit a wooden tower stood until it collapsed in November 2012, which had been used as a fire lookout tower and site for aerials of various radio services. In the 1980s, because of its good location, the tower was used by radio hams of the then Halle district contest team, including the amateur ham callsign \\"Y34H\\", used by numerous international amateur radio competitions. This tower was not built as a viewing tower, but as the site for a raised trigonometric sign above a trig point (TP) of the first order by the state survey and, for that reason, used as an observation tower. As a result of advances in technology this trig sign - like others in the other federal states - lost its significance.  Surrounding area  In the vicinity of the Viktorsh√∂he there are several tourist attractions: the Gro√üe Teufelsm√ºhle, the Bergrat M√ºller Teich (Teich = pond), the Bear Monument, the ruined castle of Erichsberg, the Bremer Teich campsite and the Erichburger Teich.

It is episode 2 of the second series of Star Stories, and first aired on Channel 4 on 2 August 2007. The show recounts Cruise's time with a group of some of his early acting friends. After filming Top Gun, Cruise (Kevin Bishop) is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta (Steve Edge), who convinces him to join the organization by smashing Cruise over the head with a shovel. He meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells) and they start a relationship. After dating Pen√©lope Cruz, Cruise is introduced to Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) by Travolta. Holmes agrees to marry Cruise, and the program ends with a voiceover asking the viewer to visit a Scientology website and purchase expensive products. The program received positive reception, and The Guardian and the Evening Times highlighted it as the \\"pick of the day\\". The Daily Mirror described it as a \\"brilliant spoof\\", and The Sunday Times characterized the show as \\"Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused\\". The Herald Sun called it a \\"ruthless but spot-on parody\\". Plot The parody of Tom Cruise (Kevin Bishop) is framed through the viewpoint of the actor's association with the Church of Scientology. The show recounts the actor's days with a group of actors known as the Brat Pack, and how he maintains a friendship with Patrick Swayze, an actor from this crowd. (Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors and actresses who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented coming-of-age films in the 1980s; Cruise has been referred to as a member due to his role in the film The Outsiders.) While filming Top Gun, Cruise is afraid he looks \\"a bit gay\\" next to his co-stars. His co-stars subsequently turn into the Village People. Cruise has alien spirit guides who appear as \\"a pair of giant blobs who speak with Welsh accents\\". They comment on Top Gun, \\"It's no ET but it's got something.\\" Cruise is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta (Steve Edge), who presents it as a \\"legitimate alien-race-based religion\\". After Travolta bashes him over the head with a shovel, Cruise remarks: \\"Ouch. . . wait a minute. Scientology. It all makes perfect sense now.\\" Ewan McGregor tries to convince Cruise to convert to the Jedi methodology. When Cruise first meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells), he asks her to sit down so that he will appear taller. Cruise performs his \\"dangling-from-the ceiling routine\\" from Mission: Impossible ‚Äì while in bed with Kidman. Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise's relationship with Pen√©lope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. \\"Greetings, Earth Man, I am here to serve you,\\" says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, \\"Affirmative\\". The show makes fun of Cruise's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he \\"jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.\\") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed on the top of the couple's wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple's wedding vows. A voiceover at the end of the program tells the viewer to visit scientologyisgreat.com and purchase ¬£4,000 worth of books. Production Comedian Kevin Bishop as parody of actor Tom Cruise Production on the second series of Star Stories was announced by Channel 4 in January 2007, and in addition to Tom Cruise, others set for parodying included Simon Cowell, Britney Spears and \\"the 1990s chart battle between Oasis and Blur\\". The show was episode two of the second series of Star Stories. The episode was first broadcast on Channel 4 on 2 August 2007. On its website, Channel 4 promoted the episode with the description, \\"Hollywood's smallest actor (after Danny DeVito) expounds on Aliens from Outer Space and the best career choices ever.\\" In August 2007, the series was set to be remade into a new version in the U.S. =Legal issues= Multiple publications commented on the potential legal implications of parodying both Tom Cruise and Scientology. \\"Given the Church of Scientology's full-throttle reaction to any criticism or mickey-taking, the Star Stories boys are sure to find themselves in the firing line,\\" wrote a reviewer for the Evening Times. A review in The Sunday Times commented, \\"Taking their careers in their hands, the Star Stories team tackle the notoriously litigious Tom Cruise ... The lawyers must still be having a nice lie down after watching.\\" In an interview with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: \\"We're not allowed to say anything about anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't.\\" He said the series was \\"well looked after\\" by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: \\"I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [we‚Äôve done it] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [it's already gone out] 'what you‚Äôre talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [er, look we‚Äôve done it it's been on telly and everyone loved and we've had no complaints] has Tom Cruise seen this?!\\" Reception The Guardian and the Evening Times highlighted the Star Stories parody as the \\"pick of the day\\". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, \\"There's everything you ever wanted to know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller\\". He characterized the parody as, \\"A toned down version of real life, then.\\" Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as \\"equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious\\". He commented, \\"This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display.\\" In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re- runs, McDonald wrote, \\"I don't care if it's been shown several times before, this is one of the shows which you just have to see again.\\" Anila Baig of The Sun highlighted the show as \\"Best Spoof\\", and wrote, \\"pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever\\". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as \\"the best gag in the whole episode\\". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, \\"Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila.\\" The Daily Mirror described the program as \\"far too funny\\". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, \\"If you want to see a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4's Star Stories.\\" She commented, \\"It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh.\\" The Advertiser described Star Stories as \\"a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups\\", and noted of the episode's title, \\"This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined.\\" The Sunday Times observed, \\"Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel.\\" Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their \\"Critics' Choice\\" column. They commented that the show's producers \\"[give] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused\\". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his \\"Top Choice\\". Adams commented, \\"This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done.\\" Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, \\"This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV.\\" The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program \\"was as subtle as a sledge hammer\\". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program \\"a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival\\".

In the case of Clitheroe, this complex was loosely clustered around the ancient wapentake of Blackburnshire. History Before the Norman Conquest, the lands of Blackburnshire were held by Edward the Confessor, while Bowland was held by Tostig, son of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. In 1092, Roger de Poitou acquired a large part of what is now Lancashire, including the hundred of Blackburnshire. By the end of the 11th century, Poitou's landholdings had been confiscated and came into the possession of the De Lacys, Barons of Pontefract and Lords of Bowland. In 1102, Henry I granted the fee of Blackburnshire and further holdings in Hornby,\\"The Medieval Borough of Hornby (Lancashire)\\", pp 187-92, Alan G Crosby, ed., Of Names and Places: Selected Writings of Mary Higham (English Place-Name Society 2007) and the vills of Chipping, Aighton and Dutton in Amounderness to Robert de Lacy, 2nd Baron of Pontefract, while confirming his possession of Bowland. These lands formed the basis of what became known as the Honour of Clitheroe. In 1205, Roger de Lacy purchased the barony of Penwortham and by 1212, he had added the manor of Rochdale. In 1235, his son John de Lacy, acquired the fee of Tottington from Henry de Monewden. The Honour passed by marriage from the De Lacys to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster in 1311 and subsequently, was incorporated into the Duchy of Lancaster. The honour had been among the lands acquired by Queen Isabella in 1327, after she deposed Edward II. In 1507, King Henry VII's Act of Disafforestation was a response to growing encroachment on the Royal Forests and paved the way for increased settlement within the Forests of Accrington, Bowland, Pendle, Rossendale and Trawden. In 1625, Charles I sold Rochdale to trustees for the Earl of Holderness, and in 1628, the manor of Penwortham was also sold. In 1661, King Charles II granted the Honour to General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, in recognition of his support during the Restoration. It then followed the inheritance of the Dukes of Albemarle, Dukes of Montagu and finally, the Dukes of Buccleuch. In 1827,the 5th Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Honour through his grandmother, the 3rd Duchess, but this was entailed upon his uncle, Henry James Montagu-Scott, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton. In 1835, the Bowland portion was sold to Peregrine Towneley. Lord Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, great-nephew of the 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton, and second son of the 5th Duke of Buccleuch, inherited the Honour in 1845. In 1896, he set up the Clitheroe Estate Company as a vehicle for the exploitation of coal and other mineral wealth, within the lands of the Honour. In 1939 the Towneley family sold the Bowland portion back to the Duchy of Lancaster. The 1938 Coal Act and subsequent nationalisation of the British coal industry led to the voluntary winding-up of the Company in 1945. In April that year, Tory MP Ralph Assheton, later 1st Baron Clitheroe, bought the residue of the land holdings from the Company for ¬£12,500.Lancashire Record Office, LRO DDHCI, Box 37 Since 1945, the Barons Clitheroe have styled themselves Lords of the Honour of Clitheroe; more formally, their legal style of address being \\"Lords of the Various Manors and Forests within the Honour of Clitheroe\\". Governance Before the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660, which effectively introduced the concept of freehold into English law, the Lord of the Honour was Lord Paramount over all the mesne lords of the Honour. He exercised governance of the Honour through manorial and forest courts. The Great Court Leet for Blackburnshire was originally held every three weeks at Clitheroe Castle, with the Steward of the Honour presiding. It had jurisdiction over the mesne manors of the Wapentake of Blackburn and within the Borough of Clitheroe, but not within the demesne manors, such as Slaidburn in the Forest of Bowland, which convened their own halmote (manorial) courts. The forest areas within the Honour were governed under forest law and jurisdiction was exercised through woodmote and swainmote courts. In the main, these appear to have been held at the demesne manor closest to the forest in question. The Forest of Bowland was a notable exception. In Bowland, for historic reasons, a strict jurisdictional divide was observed between governance of the Forest of Bowland which was centred on Whitewell and governance of the Liberty of Bowland centred on Slaidburn. This was a consequence of the shift of the caput of the Lordship of Bowland from Grindleton to Slaidburn in the second half of the fourteenth century. Manorial courts fell into disuse in the early 1920s; forest law was only repealed in the 1970s but in the case of Bowland, its forest courts had effectively ceased to operate during the 1830s. Manors and Forests within the Honour Through subinfeudation, the manorial structure of the Honour shifted over the course of nine centuries. Whitaker in Chapter 2 of his 1872 History of Whalley, Vol 1, p. 238, claims there were 28 manors within the Honour on the basis that these were all the manors of Blackburnshire. =Manors= *Slaidburn sold in 1835; reincorporated into Honour in 1950, comprising: :Land in Slaidburn, West Bradford, Grindleton and Newton-in-Bowland *Accrington (later known as Accrington Old Hold), comprising: :Land in Accrington and Oswaldtwistle, and the dependent manors of Haslingden and Huncoat *Accrington New Hold, created in 1507, comprising: :The remnant of the Forests of Accrington and Rossendale *Colne, comprising: :Land in Colne, Foulridge and Great Marsden *Ightenhill, comprising: :Land in Ightenhill, Briercliffe, Burnley, Habergham Eaves, Little Marsden, Padiham and Heyhouses *Chatburn, Worston and Pendleton :Originally separate manors, but more recently joined as one. *Rochdale purchased 1212; sold 1625 *Tottington acquired 1235 *Penwortham purchased 1205; sold 1628 *Downham sold in 1558; reincorporated into Honour in 1945 *Wapentake of Blackburn, comprising: :Land in Clitheroe, Chipping, Cliviger, Read, Simonstone and Blackburn =Forests= *Forest of Bowland sold 1835 *Forest of Blackburnshire, comprising: :Forest of Trawden :Forest of Pendle :Forest of Rossendale - Cowpe, Lench, and Musbury where added to the forest after the acquisition of Tottington. :Forest of Accrington (became Manor of Accrington New Hold after 1507) :Hoddlesden (including Yate Bank and Pickup Bank)- Originally on the western edge of the Forest of Rossendale, due to the development of Haslingden, Hoddlesden was cut off from the main body of the forest by the late thirteenth century. In 1296, it is recorded as a single vaccary (medieval cattle farm), and seems to have continued as such until the disafforesting.

Blau, a student of the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning chemist Adolf von Baeyer was originally a pharmacist but devoted himself in later life entirely to chemistry. His attempts to separate gas mixtures by physical means eventually led to the great invention of his life, a transportable liquid lighting gas from the distillation of gases. It was the manufacturer Ludwig August Riedinger who inspired the inventor to start his first production facility, the Blaugas factory in 1903 in Augsburg at the Auer roads. The Augsburg-based company operated later on with Riedinger under the name the German Blau gas company which controlled factories in Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest, Saint Petersburg, the United States, Canada and Cuba. Blau gas has a rather water-like color. It was stored in steel cylinders for shipment and had the advantages that it possessed the highest specific energy from all artificial produced gases and unlike coal gas it was free from carbon monoxide. Its main use was for lighting purposes especially in places where coal gas was not available. Blau gas factories were operated in Denmark and Holland for the supply of lighthouses. When the electric lights became more common and the extraction of propane became popular because of its cheaper production Blau gas was pushed out of the market. As a consequence of this decline, the Blaugas factory in Augsburg closed down in the fall of 1933, and moved the main operation of the company to a town in northern Germany. Blau gas experienced an almost unexpected upswing when attempts were made to run the engines of the Zeppelin airships with Blau gas. The decisive factor was the fact that the weight of Blau gas hardly differs from that of air and the use of large quantities of the propellant had little impact on the ships' buoyancy. This advantage was evident on the Zeppelin airship's first voyage to America. Starting in 1929, the Zeppelin construction facility in Friedrichshafen produced the required Blau gas in a Blau manufacturing plant; the use of Blau gas as a buoyancy compensator was demonstrated with the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. Hermann Blau was born in Graben, Karlsruhe and died in Stephanskirchen, Rosenheim. He was married to Caroline Blau, had a daughter, Martha, and four sons, Hermann, Rudolf, Edmund and Theodor.

Life Born in Taunton, Somerset, he was son of William Savage, a blacksmith. Thomas was apprenticed to the Merchant Taylors of London on 9 January 1621. He went to Massachusetts with Sir Harry Vane aboard the Planter in 1635. He was admitted a freeman of Boston in 1636. The next year he took the side of his mother-in-law, Anne Hutchinson, in the controversy that her teaching excited. He was compelled in consequence to leave the colony, and with William Coddington he and many others founded the settlement of Rhode Island in 1638. Savage was a signer of the Portsmouth Compact. After living there for some time he was permitted to return to Boston. Military career He became a member of the Military Company of Massachusetts in 1637. In 1639 he was elected as the company's second sergeant and in 1640 he became its first sergeant. In 1641 he was elected for a one year term as lieutenant of the Military Company of Massachusetts. He was reelected as lieutenant in 1645 and was elected as captain of the Company in 1651.http://www.americanwars.org/ma-ancient-artillery-company/commissioned- officers-1638-1699.htm He was also re-elected as captain in 1659, 1668, 1675 and 1680. He was probably the only person to be elected as captain of the Company five times. Political career On 12 March 1654 he and Captain Thomas Clarke were chosen to represent Boston at the general court, of which he continued a member. He was elected speaker of the assembly in 1637, 1660, 1671, 1677, and 1678. After representing Boston for eight years, he became deputy for Hingham in 1663. In 1664 he, with many other leading citizens, dissented from the policy of the colony in refusing to recognise four commissioners sent by Charles II of England to regulate its affairs, and in 1666 he and his friends embodied their views in a petition. In 1671 he was chosen deputy for Andover, and in 1675 commanded the forces of the state in the first expedition against Metacomet. In 1680 he was commissioned, with others, by the Crown to administer an oath to Sir John Leverett the governor, pledging him to execute the oath required by the act of trade. In 1680 he was elected ‚Äòassistant‚Äô or magistrate, and retained the office until his death on 14 February 1682. Upon his death his estate had a net value of over 2,500 pounds. Family Savage was twice married; first, in 1637, to Faith, daughter of William and Anne Hutchinson. By her he had three sons and two daughters. She died on 20 February 1652. On 15 September he married Mary, daughter of the Rev. Zechariah Symmes of Charlestown, by whom he had eight sons and three daughters. She survived him, and afterwards married Anthony Stoddard.

Sergei Rachmaninoff's Polka de W.R. is a virtuoso piano arrangement of Franz Behr's Lacht√§ubchen (Scherzpolka) in F major. Composition Rachmaninoff wrote the arrangement on 24 March 1911, the day after the premiere of the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom in Saint Petersburg. He dedicated it to Leopold Godowsky. It was published the same year, as part of an album of Russian pieces called Nouvelle Collection de Musique; the other composers represented in the album were Alexander Scriabin, Nikolai Medtner, Sergei Taneyev, Georgy Catoire and Alexander Goedicke. Analysis Sergei Rachmaninoff, the composer of Polka de W.R.. Polka de W.R. is in A-flat major and in 2/4. The piece starts with semi-quavers in the right-hand and a melody in the left. After four bars, this then progresses to a melody with a quaver followed by triplet semi-quavers underneath. Meanwhile, the left-hand plays a typical polka oom-cha rhythm with firstly a bass note and then a chord above. After twelve bars of this, there is then a melody in the right-hand and chords in the left. This continues for sixteen bars. There is then semi-quaver runs with the right hand, accompanied by more chords in the left. The tempo then changes to Poco piu mosso and the main theme starts. This is then followed by another tempo change to Meno mosso and a key change to C-sharp minor. There is then another theme, followed by intricate arpeggio patterns in both hands. After several bars of this, there is another modulation back to A-flat major. Another theme then proceeds until there are two bars of fast, arpeggiated patterns with a sustained chord in the left- hand. This is followed by a further theme until the end, where there is an arpeggio in both hands, a tempo change to Meno mosso, a short, two bar phrase with a melody above and chords below. There is then a penultimate, low pitched chord; followed by a higher pitched chord with a dynamic marking of pianissimo (pp) [ Polka de W.R. at allmusic]IMSLP Score Influences The tune was a favourite of Rachmaninoff's father, Vassily (the \\"W.R.\\" in the title refers to his father's initials in the German transliteration, Wassily Rachmaninoff), but it is not known whether Rachmaninoff knew its true author to be Franz Behr, or whether he believed that the melody was concocted by his father. Behr was given no mention in the published edition of Polka de W.R., and it was universally believed to be an original work of Rachmaninoff's until the late 20th century, when the true author of the melody was identified. The piece is now generally listed as being by \\"Behr/Rachmaninoff\\", or \\"Behr, arr. Rachmaninoff\\". Notable performers Its first known public performance was on 6 May 1922, by Rachmaninoff himself, at the Queen's Hall, London. He recorded it four times, without revision, and it has been recorded more than sixty more times. It was a favourite encore of pianists such as Vladimir Horowitz and Shura Cherkassky.

It begins at the city of Dordrecht where the Beneden Merwede river splits into the Noord River and the Oude Maas. It ends when it joins the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur. Geography The Oude Maas forms the southern boundary of the IJsselmonde island. Soon after Dordrecht the Dordtsche Kil forks off and after that the Oude Maas forms the northern boundary of the Hoeksche Waard island, flowing west until the Spui river forks off at the town of Oud- Beijerland. The Oude Maas then heads northwest between the towns/cities of Spijkenisse and Hoogvliet and joins the river Nieuwe Maas opposite the city of Vlaardingen. The combined river is known as Het Scheur and flows to the North Sea. The river is tidal and has nature and recreation areas. History During the early Middle Ages the main flow of the Maas followed the current Oude Maas. During the later Middle Ages, a flooding event caused the Oude Maas to connect to the Merwede rivers. From that moment on, the Oude Maas was fed by both the Maas and the Rhine. However, after the St. Elizabeth's floods the Merwede found a new and shorter path to the sea (the current Hollands Diep). As a result, the Oude Maas was devoid from much of the inflow of fresh water and changed into a brackish estuary. When the flow of the Merwede was better distributed among its lower branches (due to artificial means), the Oude Maas was once again a major distributary branch of both the Maas and Rhine. In the late 19th century the connection between the Maas and Rhine was closed off entirely (the current Afgedamde Maas) and the Maas was given a new, artificial mouth - the Bergse Maas. The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas reduced the risk of flooding and is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works. From that moment on, the Oude Maas is only fed by the Rhine.

From 1612 to 1613, he served as a Lord of the Treasury. Wotton was Treasurer of the Household from 1616 to 1618, and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Kent from 1604 until 1620.  Early life  Born in 1548, Edward was the eldest son of Thomas Wotton (1521‚Äì1587) by his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Rudston, Lord Mayor of London in 1528. Edward does not appear to have been educated at any English university, but made up for the deficiency by long study on the continent. In 1579 Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, stated that Wotton had spent three or four years among the Spanish residents at Naples and described him as \\"a man of great learning and knowledge of languages.\\"Cal. Simancas MSS.1568‚Äì79, pp. 672, 679 He was certainly an accomplished French, Italian, and Spanish scholar; Mendoza also thought him \\"a creature of Walsingham's,\\" but was unable to discover what his religion was. The Scottish diplomat James Melville of Halhill recalled an incident in Edward's early career. Edward's grand uncle Dr Nicholas Wotton was an ambassador for Mary I of England in France, during the negotiation of the peace of Cateau Cambr√©sis. Dr Wotton was troubled by accusations that English soldiers served in the Spanish army. These allegations were made by the Constable of France, Anne de Montmorency. Melville says that he sent for his young grand nephew from England, who was about 19 years old, to learn French and Italian. Edward came to the French court anonymously as a simple countryman, Melville uses the Scots language word \\"landwart\\" (Landward) which means \\"countryside\\", accompanied only by his interpreter. According to Melville, Edward got an audience with the Constable and began to discuss the political discontent in England with Mary's husband, Philip II of Spain and Spanish influence in England. Edward was supposed to have spoken of a conspiracy to deliver Calais to France. Naturally, the Constable was suspicious of the young man's offer, and Melville says he was asked if he knew anything of Wotton. Melville supplied his observation that he had seen Wotton deep in conversation with Dr Nicolas Wotton's secretary. Montmorency guessed that this was Dr Nicholas' plot to discredit him, and Edward remained a while in France, but now publicly known as the ambassador's grandnephew. Melville remembered the incident in 1585, when Edward was sent to Scotland by Francis Walsingham, and warned James VI that Edward might intend to deceive him.Thomson, Thomas, ed., Memoirs of his own life by James Melville, (1827), pp. 331‚Äì5 Career He was early given diplomatic assignments by Walsingham, and in 1574-6 was secretary to the embassy at Vienna, Sir Philip Sidney being for a time associated with him in these duties. In May 1579 Wotton was sent to congratulate Henry, the new king of Portugal, on his accession, and on his way back had an audience with Philip II of Spain at Segovia. In January 1583-4 it was proposed to send him to Spain to protest against Mendoza's conduct in England and to explain his summary expulsion by Elizabeth. (Sir) William Waad was, however, sent instead. On the following 9 Nov Wotton was returned to parliament as one of the Knights of the Shire for Kent. In May 1585 he went to Edinburgh, where James Stewart, Earl of Arran was in power, and his mission was to undermine him. There was plague in Edinburgh, and Wotton joined the king at Falkland Palace in the Fife countryside.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 748-9. In May 1586 Elizabeth, alarmed at the progress of the Catholic League in France and the success of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma in the Netherlands, selected Wotton as envoy to Scotland to persuade James VI to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance and to take the Dutch under his protection. He was also to suggest James's marriage to Anne of Denmark or Arabella Stewart, but it was not until six years later that the former scheme was adopted. Wotton received his instructions from his friend Sir Philip Sidney on 15 May, was at Berwick on the 26th, and was received by James VI at Edinburgh on the 30th. \\"Dou√© de qualit√©s brillantes, et qui excellait dans tous les exercices que Jacques VI aimait de pr√©dilection, il ne tarda pas √† prendre le plus grand ascendant sur l'esprit du jeune prince.\\"Alexandre Teulet, Papiers d'√âtat, ii, 728) At first Wotton's success appeared complete; James agreed to the proposal for an offensive and defensive league, and on 28 June the lords and estates approved. In the same month, however, the exiled Scots in England made a raid into Scotland, supported by an English force, and, though Elizabeth ordered the arrest of the offenders, James, with some reason, suspected the complicity of the English government and feared a repetition of the attempts to restore the exiled lords by force. Moreover, Arran's influence over the king was still supreme, and Arran was strenuously supported by the French party. A fresh complication arose with the murder of Lord Russell (son of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford) on 27 July. Ker of Fernihurst was the criminal, but Arran was implicated, and Elizabeth now sought to use the circumstance to ruin him. Wotton demanded his arrest and removal to England for trial, but James merely confined him in St. Andrews, whence he was soon released and resumed his ascendancy over James. Wotton's position was now precarious, and in August Arrans ally, Sir William Stewart openly insulted him in the king's presence. Elizabeth, however, hesitated to risk an open breach with James by effectively supporting her ambassador, but the despatch of Castelnau de Mauvissi√®re by Henry III of France to Scotland reinforced French influence at Edinburgh, strengthened James in his refusal to give up Arran, and made Wotton's success hopeless. He now advocated an incursion by the exiled lords, supported by an English force, and the seizure of James and Arran as the only means of restoring English prestige. But, aware of the danger to himself in such an event, he begged for his recall. This was granted on 11 Oct, but before Walslngham's letters could arrive Wotton had on his own authority crossed the border, and on the 12th he was at Berwick-upon- Tweed.full details of Wotton's negotiations are given in Cotton MSS.

About the same time it was proposed to make him secretary of state,Collins, Letters and Mem. ii. 25, 27, 30,54 but, this failing, Wotton made strenuous but vain efforts to secure a peerage.ib. ii. 85-8 In 1599, on an alarm of a Spanish invasion, he was appointed treasurer of a 'camp' to be formed, and in May 1601 he was offered but declined the post of ambassador in France. On 23 December 1602 he was made Comptroller of the Household and was sworn of the Privy Council; on 17 January 1602-3 Chamberlain wrote: \\"The court has flourished more than ordinary this Christmas. The new comptroller has put new life into it by his example, being always freshly attired and chiefly in white.\\" On the following 19 February he was appointed to negotiate with Scaramelli, the Venetian ambassador.Cal.

In November 1616 he was made treasurer of the household, but on 23 December 1617 he was \\"persuaded\\" to retire from that office by the payment of five thousand pounds. This did not satisfy him, and he clung to office some weeks longer in the vain hope of extracting a viscountancy as a further compensation. He was excluded from the council on Charles I's accession on the grounds of being a Roman Catholic.Samuel Rawson Gardiner, v. 419John Sherren Brewer, Court and Times of Charles I, i. 8) Wotton retired to Boughton Malherbe, where he died early in 1626; the inquisitio post mortem was taken on 12 April.6 Charles I, vol. iii. no. 92 Wotton‚Äôs widow had inscribed on her husband's tomb: To her beloved husband, Lord Edward Wotton, Baron of Marley, a Catholic.

Role in Literary History Wotton's half- brother, the diplomatist Sir Henry Wotton, was a poet, but Edward also played a role in the literary world, as a benefactor. He was named in the first line of his friend Sir Philip Sidney's \\"The defense of poesie\\" (1595): \\"When the right virtuous Edward Wotton and I were at the Emperor's court together, we gave ourselves to learn horsemanship of John Pietro Pugliano, one that with great commendation had the place of an esquire in his stable; and he, according to the fertileness of the Italian wit, did not only afford us the demonstration of his practice, but sought to enrich our minds with the contemplations therein which he thought most precious.\\" He also engaged John Florio to undertake the first English translation of Michel de Montaigne's \\"Essais\\", published in 1603. In his preface, Florio referred to him as his \\"not-to-be-denied Benefactor (Noble and vertuous Sir Edward Wotton)\\". George Chapman, in his 1608 translation of the Illiad, dedicated a sonnet to Edward: \\"To the right Noble, and (by the great eternizer of Virtue, Sir P. Sydney) long since eternized, Right Virtuous, the accomplished Lord Wotton. &c.;\\" Family Edward had three younger brothers: *James, knighted at Cadiz in 1596 *John, who died as young adult *A half-brother, Sir Henry Wotton, the son of Elionora Finch.Wotton, Henry, Reliquiae Wottonianae, (1672), unpaginated. Wotton first married, on 1 September 1575, Hester, daughter of Sir William Puckering. She died on 8 May 1592 and was buried in Boughton Malherbe church. His second wife was Margaret, daughter of Philip Wharton, 3rd Baron Wharton, who lived until 1652.see Calendar of the Committee for Compounding, p. 2309; Addit. MS. 5494, f. 197; and Lords' Journals, vii. 302, 388, viii. 254, 315, ix. 118 Wotton had issue by his first wife only, a son Thomas and a daughter Philippa, who married Sir Edmund Bacon. Thomas succeeded as second baron, but, being of weak health and a Roman Catholic, took little part in politics. On 6 June 1608 he married Mary (1590‚Äì1658), daughter of Sir Arthur Throckmorton, with whom he had four daughters: Katherine, who inherited Boughton Malberbe and first married Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope, by whom she was mother of Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield; secondly, John Polyander √† Kirkhoven; and, thirdly, Daniel O'Neill. His daughter Hester (d. 1649) was the third wife of Baptist Noel, third viscount Campden; his daughter Margaret married Sir John Tufton; Anne, his fourth daughter, married Sir Edward Hales, father of Sir Edward Hales, titular earl of Tenterden. He died, aged 43, on 2 April 1630 and was buried in Boughton Malherbe church; in February 1632-3 his widow was fined 500 pounds by the court of high commission for removing the font in the church to make room for her husband's tomb and for inscribing on it \\"a bold epitaph\\" stating that he died a Roman Catholic.Court and Times of Charles I, ii. 227, Works, v. 311  References  ;Attribution ; : the following references are noted in the DNB but have not been independently verified: Endnotes in the DNB but not independently verified: *Cal.

It is also known as the green bomber worm or bombardier worm. This deep ocean pelagic (free-swimming) annelid has modified bioluminescent gills that can be cast off from an individual. These discarded gills somewhat resemble green \\"bombs\\" that remain illuminated for several seconds after they have been discarded. It is thought that this is a defensive mechanism rather than reproductive, as it is seen in both mature and juvenile individuals. This species was the first of its genus, Swima, to be discovered, and was the only one with a formal scientific name as of 2010. The genus name, Swima, is derived from the Latin, referring to the animal's ability to swim. The species name, bombiviridis, is derived from the Latin prefix bombus, meaning humming or buzzing (from which the English word bomb is derived), and the suffix viridis, which is Latin for the color green. Swima bombiviridis therefore translates to \\"swimming green bomber\\".  Description  S. bombiviridis belongs to a clade that is morphologically distinct from other swimming acrocirrids by their transparent bodies, and single medial subulate branchiae. The acrocirridae are closely related to the flabelligeridae, a sister groups of worms While species of Swima live in the ocean sediment, others remain suspended up to 444 meters above the sea floor. S. Bombiviridis is further characterized by a gelatinous sheath and elliptical branchiae that it uses to drop 1mm long bioluminescent ‚Äòbombs‚Äô that luminesce for several seconds. They can grow over 30mm in length and 5 mm in width, making them relatively large in comparison to other worms of the acrocirrid family. They are also distinguished from other members of the acrocirridae, which consist of 8 genera of tiny, benthic worms that are immobile. = Distribution and habitat = S. bombiviridis resides at depths up to 3600 meters and was first recorded off the coast of Monterey Bay, California. Since then, they have only been found between 1‚Äì450 meters above the sea floor. They are holopelagic, which means they remain pelagic throughout their entire life cycle, existing exclusively in the water column. The worms are not uncommon; they travel in groups by the hundreds, however, the remoteness of their habitat renders them incredibly challenging to investigate. Greg Rouse notes that each of the seven species in its clade exhibits various intricate head appendages. These appendages contain ‚Äúbombs‚Äù, spheres that burst into light when released. The bombs evolved from gills, since they are in the same location as the gills, which can fall off easily. It remains unclear why this adaptation may have occurred. The implications of this evolutionary benefit may provide insight about how the environment of the S. bombiviridis, shapes the nature of its anatomical features. = Morphology = S. bombiviridis are mobile deep sea acrocirrid worms that have 30 bristles made of chitin, or chaetae on each parapodium. They use these bristles to propel through the water by lateral undulation in combination with a power stroke and a recovery stroke. S. bombiviridis only releases a few bioluminescent bombs at once upon mechanical stimulation along its length. Microscopy of the ‚Äòbombs‚Äô reveals that they contain hemolymph filled sacs separated by central chambers. These most likely evolved from homologous branchiae. Although it has not been confirmed, S. bombiviridis employs this ability as a mechanism of distraction, parallel to squid that release bioluminescent liquid to escape their predators. This is to be expected based on the many polychaetes that use bioluminescence for evasion. Furthermore, the bombs are unlikely to be used for reproduction due to the nature of this release, and due to the fact that these appendages are observed in both juvenile and adult forms.  Discovery  Discovered in 2009 by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, S bombiviridis was first mentioned in the August issue of the journal Science pioneered by Karen Osborn. Osborn and her team introduced this organism alongside seven new species of worm, forming a new clade of marine worms within acrocirridae. This includes the Tawi-Tawi bomber, the Shining bomber, the Horned bomber, the Tiburon Bomber, the Squidworm, and the Juanita worm, which are all swimming organisms.

Early life and career Alexey Dymovsky was born on 28 August 1977 in Blagoveshchensk, Amur Oblast, Soviet Union.\\"Short autobiography\\" (in Russian). GZT.RU (Dymovskiy.ru). Retrieved 12 January 2010. In 1992, he graduated from the 11th Secondary School in Svobodny and entered the Svobodnensky Railway Technical School, receiving a degree in 1996. On leaving education, he completed his service in the Russian Ground Forces between 1996 and 1998, and had been working in the Ministry of Internal Affairs since February 2000.\\"Description of service\\" (in Russian). GZT.RU (Dymovskiy.ru). Retrieved 12 January 2010. He served as a precinct officer at the Department of Internal Affairs (OVD) of Svobodny until 2004, and then was transferred to the Internal Affairs Directorate (UVD) of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. In 2005, he was appointed as an operative agent of the Novorossiysk UVD's operative search unit. On November 2007, Dymovsky took up his post as a senior operative agent of the murder investigation division, and had held the same post at the drug traffic control division since 2008. In May 2009, Dymovsky was conferred the rank of Major in exchange for a promise to jail an innocent person, which he subsequently was unable to fulfill. Video appeals Dymovsky decided to post video appeals on the Internet in part due to pressure that had started to be exerted on him at work following his unsuccessful attempt to raise his concerns during an annual TV program, Direct Line with Vladimir Putin, in 2006. During the program, Dymovsky had submitted a question to then-President Vladimir Putin, asking when outrages would end in the Novorossiysk militsiya. The question, which had been recorded, was never broadcast. According to Dymovky, when his call had become known in the workplace, heavy pressure began to be exerted on him; this pressure was so severe that when the Presidential Administration called him back with regards to his claims, he dared not to testify. In his video appeals to Prime Minister Putin, Dymovsky claimed that corruption in the militsiya was endemic and such practices as accusing innocent people in order to meet official crime detection targets and taking money to frame innocent people were widespread. The first part of Dymovsky's video appeal has been watched on YouTube more than 725,000 times.Russian police officer's message to Vladimir Putin (English subtitles) Dymovsky was fired from the police soon after posting the videos. His YouTube messages prompted a wave of videos from other Russian police officers describing corruption and the framing of innocent people. 2019 arrest In October 2019, he was arrested for TNT possession while riding a taxicab. Prior to his arrest, Dymovsky uploaded a video in which he states the explosives are real evidence, which his former police colleagues thrown out in the urban periphery instead of destroying them. He further contends that, after keeping them for a while, he decided to voluntarily hand them over to the police.

This deep ocean pelagic (free-swimming) annelid has modified bioluminescent gills that can be cast off from an individual. These discarded gills somewhat resemble green \\"bombs\\" that remain illuminated for several seconds after they have been discarded. It is thought that this is a defensive mechanism rather than reproductive, as it is seen in both mature and juvenile individuals. Animals of the genus Swima are closely related to the recently discovered genus Teuthidodrilus, another pelagic cirratuliform of the bathyal zone. Discovery The first specimens of the genus Swima were discovered in the deep trenches of Monterey Bay, off the coast of California. Taxonomy There are currently three species recognised within the Swima: * S. bombiviridis Osborn, Haddock, Pleijel, Madin & Rouse, 2009 (Green Bomber Worm or Bombardier Worm), Monterey Bay, California (type species) * Swima fulgida Osborn, Haddock & Rouse, 2011 (Shining Bomber) * Swima tawitawiensis Osborn, Haddock & Rouse, 2011 (Tawi-Tawi Bomber)) Anatomy and physiology Animals of the Swima are characterized by a thick gelatinous sheath, transparent body, simple nuchal organs, a single medial subulate branchia, and four pair of small segmental branchiae modified as elliptical, bioluminescent sacs.

It is owned by the Popal brothers who are believed to be cousins of Afghan President, Hamid Karzai.How the US army protects its trucks ‚Äì by paying the Taliban Aram Roston The Nation, Friday 11 November 2009 They are from the powerful Popalzai sub-tribe, the same group that the Founding Father of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, and all of Afghanistan's former leaders belonged to. The Popalzais are traditionally the influential and elite group of Afghanistan, and are also a powerful group in neighboring Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan. In addition, many Popalzai members are in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The New York Times reported that according to Western officials, the largest shareholder in the company is Qayum Karzai, the brother of Afghan President, but he stated after the report was published, that he has no financial interest in the company. Watan Group is a partner of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which in December 2011 received Afghanistan's first big contract for oil field exploration and development. The three oil fields estimated to contain 87 million barrels of oil. https://news.yahoo.com/afghanistan-clears-oil-deal- chinas-cnpc-181955411.html http://president.gov.af/en/news/5821 Their website states that they have seven subsidiaries: AMP Trading, Ehsaan Construction, Navia Design, Sino-Afghan Steel, Watan Telecom, Watan Risk Management and Watan Oil & Gas.Watan Group Watan Risk Management's clientele includes: USAID- funded Delouite, Checchi, Jhpiego, State University of New York (SUNY), American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) and other projects under the British and American militaries. Watan Risk Management Watan Risk Management (WRM) was established in 2005 by the Popal brothers and a former member of the Special Boat Service and is described as a \\"private military arm\\". In 2007, their armoury of Kalashnikovs was seized by the police despite their documentation being in order, the company believed that the raid was orchestrated by competitors in the Ministry of Interior to seize parts of their business.Crime-buster in an Armani suit takes on private armies of Kabul The Times October 31, 2007 - Note the company name is misspelt as \\"Witan\\" A major part of their business is protecting convoys of trucks carrying supplies for the American Army between Kabul and Kandahar. An article in 2009, published in The Nation accused the company of paying the Taliban so that their convoys are not attacked. An Afghan official commented that around 10% of the $360 million contract may be paid to the Taliban to protect the convoys. They control the highway between Kabul and Kandahar which all trucking companies must use to transport goods away from Kabul. They control the road because they have a pact with a local militia leader, Commander Ruhullah, who is thought to charge $1,500 for one truck to travel to Kandahar, a distance of 300 kilometers. In response to the article published in The Nation and that was also published in other publications, including The Guardian, the chairman of the group Ahmad Rateb Popal wrote a letter disputing the accuracy of the report. He stated that they have not received any business as a result of being related to Hamid Karzai and that they do not pay anybody to prevent convoys being attacked (in fact 50 guards die each month on average). He also suggested that the success of the companies meant that competitors where jealous and therefore told The Nation's reporter facts that were untrue. Afghan MP Nur-ul-haq Olomi told CBC News that it was unlikely that a security company could function without bribing insurgents saying that if companies did not pay \\"the convoys were burned and that's it.\\" Michael Semple, an expert on the Taliban, also said that it was likely WRM pay to travel safely along stretches of highway. WRM had been hired to protect the Canadians involved in building the Dahla Dam near Kandahar. According to The Toronto Star in February 2010, a standoff occurred between employees of WRM and Canadian security officials which led to the Canadians who were providing oversight over the Afghan security forces to flee the country. In May 2010, WRM were banned from operating on one of the highway between Kabul and Kandahar after a guard working for the company shot and killed a civilian. The company was ordered to pay compensation to the family of the civilian by the Afghan interior ministry.Afghanistan bars security firms Associated Press May 9, 2010 archived version The ban came into effect on May 14 but was overturned within two weeks after 1000 trucks were backlogged on the highway. In December 2010, US Army officials proposed banning Watan Risk Management from all US government work. Popals and Ruhullah separately challenged the actions. The Army decided not to debar Watan, opting instead for an administrative agreement that says the company may not bid on any convoy security contracts paid for with U.S. tax dollars for the next three years. However, the ban does not affect the other companies owned by the Popals, which include oil, gas, steel, construction and telecom businesses, according to the terms of the agreement signed in early August. Furthermore, in the summer of 2011, in a stunning reversal of course, Army officials inexplicably stopped the debarment proceedings and settled with Watan Risk Management and Commander Ruhullah. http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2011/09/15/us-officials-to-face-questions- about-decision-not-to-ban-afghan-company-accused-of-corruption.phtml Watan Telecom Watan Telecom is a consortium of Al Houbi Telecom of Saudi Arabia and two North American companies, Cellular One and GlobeCom.
