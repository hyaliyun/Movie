The magazine is based in Orem, Utah in the United States. With its first edition in June 2007, Avances Magazine's motto is to \\"Advance the Hispanic Community\\". The magazine ceased publication in November 2012. Content Avances Magazine had two goals; to bring interesting and entertaining articles that would help to educate and increase prosperity within the Hispanic community and to help companies enter into the growing Hispanic marketplace. The articles within Avances were written by politicians, business owners, motivational writers, community leaders, and others that succeeded in family or business life. Two of the most popular contributing editors are Adam Legas and Javier Estrada. Legas is a mixed martial arts trainer and writes about fitness and nutrition. Javier Estrada wrote articles on sales, leadership and management. U.S. immigration controversy In March‚ÄìApril 2010, Avances published a number of articles favoring the controversial 2010 Arizona Immigration Law, which created emotional and racial responses in and around the Hispanic community. The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (introduced as Arizona Senate Bill 1070 and thus often referred to simply as Arizona SB 1070) is a legislative act in the U.S. state of Arizona that is the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in decades. It has received national and international attention and has spurred considerable controversy. In mid April, the magazine's website was hacked by a group calling itself the Albakatils Organization which replaced the home page with its own. The altered page depicted blood dripping from the title \\"Hacked\\" with a background color of blood red. Zone-H.org reports the organization‚Äôs base of operations to be out of Pristina, Serbia.Zone-H.org - Hack Tracking Organization KSL-NBC News also reported the administrators‚Äô password had been changed to \\"H8 Mexicans\\". Layout Avances Magazine followed a typical magazine format by featuring a letter from the Editor, articles, and advertisements. While the majority of the advertisements were not Hispanic businesses, there were many advertisements that focused solely on the Hispanic community as it was their core business. Subsequent issues of Avances included word count, interesting photos, and a larger font. Circulation, distribution, readership There were 80,000 magazines printed monthly.Linkin Company Information Avances was a subscription magazine as well as having distribution placed on 600 newsstands or business countertops as well as mailed to over 500 waiting rooms. Circulation was concentrated in the western states of California, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Utah. According to Avances Magazine, readership was generally 70 percent Hispanic and 30 percent non-Hispanic.Avances web site References External links * Avances Magazine Web Site Bilingual magazines Defunct magazines published in the United States Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Magazines established in 2007 Magazines disestablished in 2012 Magazines published in Utah Monthly magazines published in the United States Spanish-language magazines ","title":"Avances Magazine"},{"id":"25065710","text":"Robert Bauer (born 1952) is an American attorney who served as White House Counsel in the administration of President Barack Obama.

The concert was part of the band's A Matter Of Life And Death Tour. The name Eddfest is taken from the band's mascot Eddie. The concert was and still remains the largest paid concert ever to take place in India with an estimated 38,000 Article by John McMurtrie people in attendance. It marked the first visit of Iron Maiden to the Indian subcontinent, and the first major heavy metal concert to take place in the country. Other bands which played at the concert included Lauren Harris, Indian Rock veterans Parikrama and Ftn. announcement on official page The concert garnered much media frenzy and mainstream attention not only in India, but all over the world with many international journalists flying into Bangalore. The event was also covered in the documentary film Global Metal by Sam Dunn and Scott McFadyen, Global Metal documentary information which also features live recordings of the concert. Apart from fans from all over India, people traveled for this event from neighboring countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand and China. Setlist Venue The venue for the historic concert was the Bangalore Palace Grounds located in north Bangalore. The entire venue was enclosed within the grounds and was initially only meant for accommodating 25,000 people. But the enormous demand for tickets lead to the venue being over crowded with 35,000 people inside and around 4,000 people outside who could not enter as tickets were all sold out. The front crowd barrier just in front of the stage had to be refortified by dozens of security staff members standing their ground supporting the barrier and placing bamboo and wooden sticks to hold the barrier due to overcrowding. Significance Apart from being the largest music concert to be held in India, the event was also responsible for opening the gates for other international hard rock and heavy metal bands to tour in India. Iron Maiden themselves were overwhelmed by the crowd response and have since played 2 more times in the country. It was also the first concert in India to have official merchandise stores at the venue. The festival is also seen as a precursor and the basis on which the now yearly Rock In India festival is based on, as Eddfest was the first of its kind rock festival in the country. The Rock In India festival takes place at the same venue as Eddfest. The event grossed over Rs 45,000,000 in ticket sales and another Rs 900,000 in merchandise revenue making it the most profitable concert in India with regards to total gate revenue. Ticketpro international reported that the remarkable success of the event was highlighted by the fact that almost 80 percent of the tickets were sold well before the concert, which is very unusual for India. Ticketpro.biz article on Iron Maiden's first show in India Live audio updates on the radio were constantly broadcast from the venue on Radio Indigo throughout the day. Sponsors The Eddfest event was produced by DNA Networks India in conjunction with NOUS Productions, Indiatimes web page and sponsored by Vh1, Nokia India, Reliance Mobile, Pepsi, NDTV 24x7, Radio Indigo, Royal Challenge and Sanyo. Travel sponsors were Lufthansa Airlines. On-line ticketing was handled by ticketpro India and on-line marketing was done by indiatimes.com. Levi's was the merchandising partner of the event.

It was included as the fifth track on their 1983 studio album Kilroy Was Here. The song in the story of Kilroy Was Here has the character of Dr Righteous (portrayed by James \\"JY\\" Young) preaching the \\"evils\\" of rock and roll. Although the song got only minor airplay on FM rock radio, its music video received significant airplay on MTV. It would be released as a B-side to the single \\"Music Time\\" (from the band's 1984 double live album Caught in the Act) in 1984. Backmasking The song begins with the backmasked Latin words \\"annuit c≈ìptis, novus ordo seclorum\\". Translated from the Latin, these words mean \\"He/God has favored our undertakings, a new order of the ages\\".\\"The Great Seal of the United States,\\" U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Washington, D.C., July 2003, p. 5.

If listened closely enough, just after the second refrain and instrumental break, another backmasked message can be heard, saying \\"Rock & roll is evil\\", mocking the purported dangers of backmasking. The backmaskings are thought to have been a response to claims of secret messages in previous songs by Evangelical Christian Tipper Gore, Al Gore's wife. Video The video of the track was directed by Brian Gibson (alongside the videos for \\"Mr. Roboto\\" and \\"Don't Let It End\\"). The video has Dr. Righteous performing a sermon on The Dr. Righteous Show with his two henchmen (portrayed by the Panozzo twins) by his side. Interspersed is footage of people and members of The Majority for Musical Morality setting fire to guitars and records. On Righteous' TV show, Righteous brainwashes a youth who was inflicted with the \\"evils\\" of rock and roll which was almost thwarted when Jonathan Chance (played by Tommy Shaw) tried to save the youth only to escape from being arrested by the Majority of Musical Morality. While the Tommy Shaw character mimes the guitar solo, it is actually played by James 'J.Y.' Young. At the end of the clip, Righteous succeeds in \\"curing\\" a youth from the \\"evils\\" of rock and roll.

G-M406 is a branch of Haplogroup G Y-DNA (M201). More specifically in descending order, G-M406 is a subbranch also of G2 (P287), G2a (P15) and finally G2a2b (L30/S126) Haplogroup G-M406 seems most common in Turkey and Greece. Secondary concentrations of G-M406 are found in the northern and eastern Mediterranean, and it is found in very small numbers in more inland areas of Europe, the Middle East, and the southern Caucasus Mountains area. Genetic features A large number of G-M406 persons have the value of 21 at short tandem repeat (STR) marker DYS390, and all G-M406 men will have the M406 SNP mutation which characterizes this group. The 21 at DYS390 is uncommon among G persons outside the G-M406 group. In G-M406 persons, the DYS391 marker has mostly a value of 10, but sometimes 11, and DYS392 is almost always 11 except in one distinct cluster. If a sample meets the criteria indicated for these three markers, it is likely the sample is G-M406. This M406 SNP was first reported in 2008. The M designation indicates it was first identified at Stanford University. M406 is located on the Y chromosome at position 2809995, reference SNP ID i4000120. The mutation involves a change from T to G. The SNPs L184 and L185 (respectively 17586994 with a mutation from A to G, and 20922998 with a mutation from C to G) were found to exist in only some members of a M406+ family and are now considered private SNPs with no practical use outside this family. Age of origin of G-M406 Research studies have not addressed the age of G-M406. Based on available 67-marker STR samples, it would seem that the mutation that defines G-M406 arose perhaps about 4,000 years ago. Geographical distribution The ability to describe G-M406 distribution accurately is handicapped by the rather recent identification of the defining G-M406 SNP and the resulting paucity of samples tested for M406. Some estimate of G-M406 percentages can be made, however, by noting the percentage of men with STR marker G samples which have the distinctive 21 value at DYS390 found almost exclusively among G persons within G-M406 and making use of samples tested at commercial labs and in research papers. =Turkey and Greece= Perhaps about 5% of men in Turkey are G-M406, the highest percentage of the general population in any country yet sampled. This 5% figure is based on the finding of the value of 21 at STR marker DYS390 in 21 of 57 G samples from throughout Turkey. Among G persons, the 21 value is seen overwhelmingly in G-M406 persons. But values other than 21 occur to a small extent in G-M406 persons. So the total G-M406 percentage within Turkish G is likely close to 50 percent, and the 57 SNP-confirmed G samples represent 11% of 523 Turkish samples obtained in the largest study yet conducted of Turkish population genetics. In adjacent Greece, SNP testing determined that half of eight G samples were G-M406. The G samples represented 5% of 171 Greek samples. In contrast in nearby Crete, G-M406 was only 20% of the 21 G samples, with G samples representing 11% of 193 island samples. Though treated separately in this study, Crete is part of Greece but with a different settlement history. Farther out in the Mediterranean, in a smaller sample size from Cyprus 4 of 7 G samples have the distinctive 21 value seen overwhelmingly in G-M406 persons. =Middle East= Just to the south of Turkey among the Kurds of Iraq 7 of 14 likely G STR samples in the YHRD database have the value of 21 at DYS390 suggesting half the G population there belongs to G-M406. This relatively high percentage of G-M406 is confined to the country's northern Kurdish region. Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine also have significant G-M406 populations though small sample sizes make broad conclusions difficult. In one study, 4 of 5 Palestinian G samples have the distinctive DYS390=21 value. In Lebanon, at least 10 of 37 G samples have G-M406 features and are found among all the major religions there. In Jordan, 7 of 15 available G samples have 21 at marker DYS390. None of the G samples among the Druze peoples in these locations have STR marker values typical of G-M406 persons according to recent studies. However, recent testing on Family TreeDNA points to some families whose origins lie in Palestine/Israel, but who have moved to Lebanon or Syria prior to the 1500-1700 period who happen to be carrying around 50-60% of the Druze among the Haplogroup G population in Druze. There is initially reasonable assurance the samples are within the DYS459=8 subgroup (that is also negative for its own DYS392=12 subgroup). Overall, these sets of related subgroups make up a major part of G-M406 men and are negative for the L14 and L645 SNP-defined subgroups. The sample has a few marker values that are a little different and the Druze samples have 22 at DYS390 compared to the more typical 21 in the majority of G-M406 samples. So this is good indirect evidence that at least half of the G among the Druze is G-M406. In Syria, G-M406 seems less common than in the countries closer to the Mediterranean. Only 3 of 17 G samples there have the 21 value discussed. =Other areas= The largest source of G STR samples from Iran is the YHRD database where only 1 of 340 Iranian samples has a value of 21 for DYS390 together with the other marker values consistent with G-M406 samples. It is possible G-M406 persons in Iran have different STR marker values. The countries that share the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman with Iran were the subject of a separate small study which provided STR samples with G patterns similar to those in Iran. But the percentage of G-M406 (based on the 21 value) would seem higher than in Iran in Dubai with half of 6 G samples with 21. None of the three G samples from Yemen and Saudi Arabia had this DYS390 value. In the Nasidze study of the Caucasus Mountains area, his 87 likely G STR samples now in the YHRD database have only 8 samples with the distinctive DYS390 value of 21 that is the overwhelming feature of the G-M406 group. Only in Georgia where 3 of 16 likely G samples have 21 does G-M406 apparently have a significant presence. The Haplogroup G Project newsletter is gradually summarizing the percentage of G-M406 men in other areas based on the likely or proven G-M406 samples in the project's large project G database. This source has more reliability in identifying the totality of G-M406 samples because it does not rely on the value at STR marker DYS390 as the sole criterion. The newsletter indicates (in descending order) in Italy 20% of 156 G samples......Spain 15% of 56 G samples.....Netherlands 15% of 20 G samples......Switzerland 8% of 51 G samples.....Iran 6% of 34 G samples....Poland 4% of 75 G samples......France 4% of 46 G samples......Ireland 3% of 29 G samples.......India 3% of 18 G samples. In addition, a research study which provided Indian and Pakistani STR marker samples did not find that any of the 20 G samples from various groups contained the DYS390=21 value so typical of G-M406. And a study of Sardinia found 7% of 51 G STR samples had the characteristic 21 value. Possibly of significance, half of these \\"21\\" samples were found in the asylum land of the ancient Sardinian population in the isolated central highlands which has no evidence of occupation by external colonial powers beginning with the Phoenician period. In the Spanish islands to the west of Sardinia, in another study none of 7 G STR samples from Ibiza are G-M406, but 2 of 4 G samples in Majorca have the DSY390 value of 21. This same study found one 21 value among 25 G Sephardic Jews whose history is intertwined with Spain. Of the 291 STR samples of all types in the YHRD database from Egypt none of the DYS390=21 samples has the same features of known G-M406 samples from other areas of the Mediterranean. G-M406 subgroups =L14 G2a2b1a1a= G2a2b1a1a is characterized by possessing the SNP mutation designated either as L14 or S130. G2a2b1a1a persons typically have DYF395S1 values of 16,16 and a DYS565 value of 11. L14 and S130 are different designations for the same SNP mutation. The L14 version was developed at Family Tree DNA, and S130 was developed at Ethnoancestry. But this mutation was first identified at the University of Central Florida in 2006 as U16 and well before the associated researchers published a formal description in 2009 of its location at 21327383 on the Y chromosome, reference number rs35474563. The mutation involves a C to T change. Another SNP of interest is S133 which was first identified in 2008 at Ethnoancestry in London, England in a G-M406 person, but it is also available as L90 elsewhere. Its location on the Y chromosome is given as 20087688, reference number rs35169834. The mutation is a change from G to A. In the several persons in which this mutation have been found it does not form a separate category from G2a2b1a1a because the tested persons also had the mutation that defines G2a2b1a1a (L14 or S130). It is possible there are persons who are positive (derived) for either L14/S130 while negative (ancestral) for L90/S133, and such a situation would necessitate creating a separate G-M406 category. =L645 G2a2b1a1b2a = G2a2b1a1b2a is characterized by possessing the SNP mutation designated as L645. G2a2b1a1b2a persons so far all have the value of 9 at STR marker DYS578. Both European and Near Eastern members of this subgroup have been identified. L645 was first identified at Family Tree DNA in summer 2011. It was found at chromosome position 2948673 and represents a mutation from A to C. =The DYS454=12 cluster= There is a cluster of G-M406 men not belonging to the G2a2b1a1a subgroup who (1) have the unusual (for G-M406 men) value of 12 at STR marker DYS454 instead of the ancestral 11 value (2) and have a relatively close genetic distance when 67 markers are compared. The shared common ancestor may have lived about 2,000 years ago or so. This DYS454 STR marker is not as reliable as a SNP mutation for categorizing men, but the 12 value plus other uncommon features and the close genetic distance make is certain this a distinct subgroup. A few persons who belong to this cluster may have had more recent ancestors who mutated to a value other than 12, but such samples have not surfaced. Many men in this cluster have developed one or two other mutations at STR markers which make the cluster even easier to identify. The largest number of cluster men have a mutation at DYS459a from the ancestral 9 to 8. And many have a mutation from the ancestral 11 to 12 at DYS392. The DYS392=12 value is seen almost exclusively in G1 persons, with this G-M406 cluster being a major exception. This cluster seems overwhelmingly made up of three identifiable ethnic groups (a) Ashkenazi Jews based on distinctive surnames together with ancestral origins in northeastern Europe south of Scandinavia, (b) Conversos with Hispanic surnames and (c) Men with Italian ancestral origins. However, an available sample from Iran also likely belongs to this cluster. The Ashkenazi Jews are so far not found in the group with the ancestral 11 at DYS392. And the Hispanics are so far not found within the DYS392=12 group. (See also page covering Jews with Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)). =The DYS459b=10 cluster= The men in this cluster of G-M406 men do not belong to the G2a2b1a1a subgroup and have (1) the unusual (for G-M406 men) value of 10 at STR marker DYS459b instead of the ancestral 9 value (2) and have a relatively close genetic distance when 67 markers are compared. This is so far a relatively small cluster with French and British ancestral histories. Too few samples are available to estimate with some reliability when the common male ancestor of this cluster may have lived. =The DYS436=14 cluster= The men in this cluster of G-M406 men do not belong to the G2a2b1a1a subgroup and have the unusual (for G-M406 men) value of 14 at STR marker DYS436 instead of the ancestral 12 value This is so far a relatively small cluster with ancestral histories confined to Galicia and Basque country in Spain and to various parts of Portugal. Too few samples are available to estimate with some reliability when the common male ancestor of this cluster may have lived. Migrations of G-M406 persons It is logical that G-M406 spread westward along the Mediterranean from the area where it is most concentrated today (Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean countries) in conjunction with the trading, slave-selling and other migratory events originating in these lands. The first great trading empire that joined both ends of the Mediterranean was the Phoenician that originated in the Israel- Lebanon-Jordan area. After the demise of the Phoenicians, the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and some \\"barbarians\\" could have spread G-M406 from the eastern Mediterranean to the west. In comparisons of 67-marker G-M406 STR samples available from inland Europe with similar samples from (1) Turkey (2) Lebanon- Jordan and (3) Armenia certain deductions can be made. Most G-M406 Europeans have Armenians as their nearest relatives. Based on the number of mutations observed, some of these probably share common male ancestors as recently as the Dark Ages. Only one European showed Jordan/Lebanon samples as the nearest G relatives. Likewise none of the Europeans showed Turks alone as nearest relatives, but rather some European samples had Turks and Armenians equally related. The sharing of common ancestors much farther back in time (perhaps 3,500 years ago) among some of these samples does not provide information so useful because the migration westward could have occurred anytime in the earlier period. The finding of likely G-M406 samples in the ancient isolated highlands of Sardinia, however, suggests the arrival of G-M406 in that island prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians. The latter began a Sardinian coastal presence about 3,000 years ago. There is currently no information to explain the dispersion of G-M406 to the southern Indian area.

There are many islands and coves on this body of water. This can sometimes make it difficult for new visitors to navigate the lake. There are also many hazards to look out for, and boating should be done with caution. These hazards include prop-chewing stumps that lie just beneath the surface, along with shallow rocks. A boater should always be on the lookout for these obstacles and maintain a safe operating speed. Fishing Greenwood is much like any other lake in the fact that fishing may sometimes be fantastic or incredibly slow. There is a good variety of warmwater gamefish present, and fish populations are healthy. Michigan's DNR website shows that quite a few Master Angler fishGreenwood Reservoir in Master Anglers have been caught from this lake. Some of the available species present in the lake that are worth mentioning are: *Northern Pike *Walleye *Largemouth Bass *Smallmouth Bass *Bluegill *Pumpkinseed *Crappie The task of fishing Greenwood is pretty straight forward in comparison to similar bodies of water. There is plenty of fish-holding structure present all over the lake. These structures include stump fields, submerged timber, brush piles, rocky reefs and points, coves, steep rocky bluffs, weedy drop-offs, and deep holes; none of which are difficult to locate.

Retrieved on November 11, 2009.  Early life  Debevoise was born on December 14, 1899 in Manhattan, the son of Anne Farnam Whitney and Thomas McElrath Debevoise. He was named after his great-great grandfather, Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin. He graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., in 1917 and subsequently enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually attaining the rank of second lieutenant.  Legal career  He graduated from Yale University in 1921 and from the Harvard Law School in 1925. After graduation, Debevoise immediately joined his father‚Äôs Manhattan law practice, but later became an associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell, a firm headed by John W. Davis, the Democratic candidate for president in 1924. In 1931 Debevoise and William Stevenson, a fellow associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell, formed a partnership under the name Debevoise & Stevenson, which later became Debevoise & Plimpton, with a total of $2,366 in their account.

On November 12, 2009 a collapse occurred in an illegal, privately owned gold mine in Dompoase, Ashanti Region, Ghana. Up to 30 miners were prospecting the mine when it collapsed because of a landslide. At least 18 workers were killed in the collapse, including 14 women and the owner of the mine. Officials have described the disaster as the worst mine collapse in Ghanaian history. Police in the Ghanaian capital of Accra have launched an investigation, and are looking into the possibility of criminal negligence. The police commander in the Western Region of Ghana, Kojo Antwi Tabi, called the disaster \\"the biggest mining tragedy that has ever hit Ghana\\". He also stated that he believed the government should take more measures to control the activities conducted in the mines. Safety measures in the mine were described as \\"poor or nonexistent\\". The mine owner had contracted 6 men and 24 women to work the mine. The men performed the mining and digging, while the women carried out the soil for sorting. A 27-year-old survivor in a hospital claimed that she was the last person out of the mine and stated that everyone would have escaped were it not for a large tree that fell during the landslide. Police are searching for additional victims trapped in the mine. Because of the possibility of another collapse, rescue efforts remain extremely dangerous. It has been difficult to identify the bodies of the dead as well, as most of the miners were not from Ghana.

He began his military career on 8 November 1908, when he entered the Italian Naval Academy at Livorno. By the time he reported for aviation training on 15 June 1916, he was a seasoned sailor. On 14 October, he was rated as a pilot; three days later, he was assigned to Brindisi Naval Air Station, which he would rise to command.Franks et al 1997, pp. 152‚Äì153. On 15 May 1917, he staked his first aerial victory claim; however, it was denied, and aviation historians have since been unable to find a corresponding Austro- Hungarian loss. However, on 7 June, he shot down a Lohner K flying boat, killing both the crew; this was his first real aerial victory. In December 1917, Pierozzi was appointed to command a naval squadron, 255a Squadriglia. Pierozzi had managed the remarkable feat of winning three Silver and one Bronze award of the Medal for Military Valor during the year. On 18 March 1918, Pierozzi was appointed to command of the newly formed Italian naval fighter group of two squadrons of Macchi M.5 flying boat fighters. He thoroughly trained and directed the new unit, and flew with one of its units, 260a Squadriglia. On 1 May 1918, he shot down a Hansa-Brandenburg W.18 over Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia for his second victory. Then, on 14 May, he forced one Austro-Hungarian W.18 to land, set another on fire and forced it to land, and shared in a third victory with Martinengo. On 22 May, he splashed a land-based enemy Phonix D.I fighter in the Aegean Sea west of Rovigno. He would not score his last accredited victory on 2 July 1918. He would fight on until the Austro-Hungarian surrender on 3 November 1918; that day he would transfer to the newly reconquered city of Trieste. Pierozzi's war had ended after 700 combat sorties, including over 500 fighter missions. He had submitted 16 claims for aerial victories, only seven of which were approved. On 17 March 1919, Pierozzi began a return flight to Trieste from Venice in a Macchi M.9 seaplane with a fellow naval lieutenant aboard. His passenger was another fighter pilot, His Royal Highness Aimone di Savoia. A half mile from Trieste, as they let down into the harbor in deteriorating flying weather, a gust of wind flung the M.9 into the harbor breakwater. A nearby steamship, the Tergeste, immediately rescued both fliers. However, Orazio Pierozzi died the next day. He was awarded a fourth silver medal for Military Valor posthumously for his efforts in protecting his passenger during the accident.

She was played by Wendy Richard. Role Miss Shirley Brahms is the junior ladieswear assistant. Known for her Cockney accent, Miss Brahms is sometimes unintelligible to the person with whom she is speaking, but she often puts on her best voice when answering the telephone. Under Mrs. Slocombe's guidance, she becomes a more useful assistant throughout the series, though the hierarchy of Grace Brothers is such that she would have moved up only when Mrs. Slocombe left, if ever. Attractive and voluptuous, she is never receptive to advances of older men. In one incident, when she was approached to participate in a store-wide Holiday Girl contest with the assumption that she would easily win, Miss Brahms refuses, mainly because one of the prizes is a vacation aboard the yacht of Old Mr. Grace, who had previously made lecherous advances toward her. In spite of their age difference of 28 years, Miss Brahms's best friend is Mrs. Slocombe; they are often seen gossiping and going against the management. While she is proud of her working-class roots, she bemoans her present existence and yearns for a more glamorous and exciting life. Several episodes show that she can put on a convincingly posh accent, although since the vocabulary and syntax don't improve with her voice, this is often more a hindrance than a help. Miss Brahms's largest sale occurs when Mrs. Slocombe, who had temporarily replaced Mr. Rumbold, is not by her side. Miss Brahms often makes reference to her swinging social life and the mores of the times (such as not wearing a bra and sleeping in the nude), usually to the disdain (but interest to see if it attracted men) of Mrs. Slocombe and the immediate interest of either (or all) Mr. Humphries, Mr. Spooner, and Mr. Lucas (and sometimes Captain Peacock, Mr. Harman/Mr. Mash, and the Grace brothers). Wendy Richard also played a character named Shirley in Dad's Army. When she joined the cast of Are You Being Served?, her character's name was changed to Edith Parish to avoid confusion with Miss Brahms.Wendy Richard No S with Lizzie Wiggins Implied affairs with the Menswear Juniors Out of all the men at Grace Brothers, the nearest she has ever come to having a relationship with are the junior salesmen. She is the object of Mr. Lucas's affections ‚Äì he frequently asks her out, sends notes to her asking her to meet him after work, and consistently refers to her as \\"Shirley\\" whenever he can get away with it. Miss Brahms occasionally indulges him and they date sporadically throughout the series, even kissing twice when rehearsing a Punch and Judy show. She has worked well with Mr. Spooner, helped him, when they and the floor went against the management. They were also seen coming into work together and comforted each other when offended by Captain Peacock, and in \\"The Pop Star\\", she asks him to go out with her. In \\"Cold Store\\" Miss Brahms and Mr. Humphries are forced to work together, and it is clear that they have had a good time together. The two are forced to work together again, selling perfume in \\"Bliss\\". In \\"The Erotic Dreams Of Mrs Slocombe\\" Miss Brahms shows Mr. Humphries how to flirt but it works too well and Mr. Humphries ends up wildly pulling her to the ground in a theatre-box. They share a kiss in \\"The Hold Up\\". In \\"Mrs Slocombe Expects\\", Miss Brahms appears showing off her legs, and Mr Lucas and Mr Humphries burst into a flirtatious song. Attraction and advances It is stated at times that she is considered the \\"prettiest\\" girl at Grace Brothers, with Young Mr. Grace at one point considering her as a strong candidate to be one of his secretaries. Miss Brahms' legs are displayed quite often to the members of staff, either innocently (as she attempts to fix a suspender or show off a ladder in her tights) or on purpose (such as when Mr. Lucas triggers an air vent under her skirt, Marilyn Monroe-style). Although she is picked to be the public face of Grace Brothers (in the episode \\"Closed Circuit\\") due to her good looks, her high-pitched Cockney accent proves to be unsuitable (and ultimately cost her a chance at romance, as a Lord falls in love with her voice, which is actually dubbed on by Mr. Grace's blonde nurse). Although Miss Brahms resents being viewed as nothing more than a pretty face, she does on a couple occasions use her feminine wiles to charm Captain Peacock when she wants something. Grace and Favour Wendy Richard reprised the role of Miss Brahms for the spin-off show, Grace and Favour, in 1992 and 1993.

This period lasted around 5,000 years, between roughly 65,800 BP and 59,500 BP. This period is important as it, together with the Stillbay period 7,000 years earlier, provides the first evidence of human symbolism and technological skills that were later to appear in the Upper Paleolithic. Naming The poort was named after a \\"Mr Howison\\" but it was misspelt by Stapleton and Hewitt as Howieson pp. 110-111 ‚ÄúFather P. Stapleton ‚Ä¶ and Dr John Hewitt‚Ä¶ excavated a small rock shelter .. The poort was named after a Mr Howison, but Stapleton and Hewitt (1927) spelled it Howieson in their publication and this spelling has been applied ever since to the stone tool industry that they first described there (Goodwin & Van Riet Lowe 1929).‚Äù and their error has been used ever since for the stone tool industry named after it.Goodwin AJH. van Riet Lowe C. (1929). The Stone Age cultures of South Africa. Annals of the South African Museum, 27. Note the site is always spelled with an apostrophe but the period can be spelt variably with and without it. Description The rock shelter occurs in a hill on the north side of the Howieson's Poort containing the main road into Grahamstown from Port Elizabeth.A poort in South African English is a mountain pass or gap, usually cut by a stream or river. The cave is halfway up a cliff and is deep and wide at the mouth, with a large Real Yellowwood tree growing in the deposit and \\"bent horizontal with the floor to allow its branches to spread into the open at the mouth of the shelter\\". The original Howiesons Poort period remains were covered very slowly due to the cave's position halfway up the cliff and to wind clearance. 20,000 years ago, however, a rock fall acted to protect the deposits near the front from wind erosion. Excavation It was excavated in the late 1920s, and then again in 1965 by Hilary and Janette Deacon. There are very little in situ deposits left. All the artifacts at the Howieson's Poort site were found below a barren layer about a foot thick in a black layer also about a foot thick. The stone tools were mostly large segments or 'crescents', obliquely backed blades and unifacial and bifacial points. There are no rock paintings, nor bone or shell artifacts, though bone and shell artifacts are found in the deposits elsewhere of the Howiesons Poort period. Stone tools similar to those in the cave have been collected from hillsides above the rock shelter. Originally, and until the mid-1970s, the remains at Howiesons Poort Shelter were thought to belong to the Magosian period and so intermediate in time and technology between the Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age. However, optically stimulated luminescence dating pushed back dates for occupation by this period to 65,800 BP and 59,500 BP. Apart from the Howiesons Poort period, Deacon proposed that the cave may have been occupied more recently for several very short periods (ca. 18-19000 BP, ca. 9-10000 BP and ca. 3-4000 BP) by people who made fires but left few or no artefacts. However, this explanation is presented only as one of a number of possible scenarios.

Together with his five brothers and one sister Nesta they founded the notable FitzGerald/FitzMaurice Dynasty which was to play an important role in Irish history. By right of his wife, the heiress Eve de Bermingham, Gerald was granted the barony of Offaly, thus becoming the first Lord. He is the ancestor of the Kildare and Leinster branch of the dynasty. Confusingly, his father Maurice was granted the lordship of Offelan in north County Kildare in 1175 by Strongbow.Ancient Naas; JCKAS 1893, p.186  Family  Gerald FitzMaurice was born in Wales in about 1150, the second eldest son of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan by his wife, Alice (daughter of Arnulf de Montgomery).Weis, Frederick Lewis. Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700. Eighth ed. (2008), p. 169. Line 178-4. Gerald had one sister, Nesta, who was named after their celebrated grandmother, Princess Nest ferch Rhys, and five brothers, including the eldest, William FitzMaurice, 1st Baron of Naas.  Career  Gerald's father was the leader of the first landing of Normans who arrived in Ireland in 1169 to assist the exiled Irish King of Leinster Dermot MacMurrough regain his kingdom. Accompanying his father from Wales to Ireland, he and his brother Alexander showed great valour in the battle against Roderick O'Conor outside the walls of Dublin in 1171. Upon the death of their father, on 1 September 1176, Gerald's elder brother William granted him half the cantred of Ophelan with centres at Maynooth and Rathmore. He was confirmed in them by Prince John in 1185. William Fitzaldhelm deprived him and his brothers of their stronghold of Wicklow, though after a time compelled to give them Ferns in exchange. He had already received from Strongbow Naas and other districts in what became County Kildare, and had erected Maynooth Castle. In 1197, he took part in the conquest of Limerick acquiring Croom, County Limerick.Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 107th edition, Volume 2, p.2297 In 1199, though receiving King John's letters of protection, he was ordered to \\"do right\\" to Maurice Fitzphilip for the lands of 'Gessil and Lega', that he had taken from Maurice. Between 1185 and 1204, Fitzgerald, had established a settlement at Geashill. Originally of motte-and-bailey design, it was a timber castle on an earthen mound, nearby were located the church and tenant dwellings. On his death Gerald was still in possession of those estates. In the 15th century the wooded fortress at Geashill was replaced by a stone tower house. Today, only the west wall of the castle remains.

Gerald is described by his cousin, Giraldus Cambrensis, as small in stature, but distinguished for prudence and honesty. He was the patrilineal ancestor of the earls of Kildare.  Marriage and issue  Sometime around 1193, he married as her first husband, Eve de Bermingham (died between June 1223 and December 1226), daughter of Sir Robert de Bermingham. In marriage, he received the barony of Offaly, becoming the first FitzGerald Lord of Offaly. Together Gerald and Eve had one son: * Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly, Justiciar of Ireland (1194- 20 May 1257), married Juliana N.N., by whom he had four sons. Following Gerald's death on 15 January 1204, Eve would go on to marry two more times. Her second husband was Geoffrey FitzRobert, and her third, whom she married sometime after 1211, was Geoffrey de Marisco, Justiciar of Ireland.

APRESt is made up of three main projects: 1) Incentives & Inputs 2). AP School Choice and 3). School Health. Each project aims to rigorously evaluate education initiatives in India. The Azim Premji Foundation is the lead executor of each project in APRESt.  Background  APRESt was initiated by Karthik Muralidharan, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego and Venkatesh Sundararaman, a senior economist at the World Bank, in partnership with the Azim Premji Foundation and the Government of Andhra Pradesh. In 2004, APRESt began with the Incentives & Inputs study, which seeks to understand how to improve educational outcomes of students using performance pay and educational inputs such as providing extra teachers and grants for schools to purchase classroom materials. In 2007, APRESt expanded with the launch of a project about school choice, which seeks to understand how providing equal access to education affects learning outcomes. In the summer of 2009, APRESt initiated another project, which focuses on the impact of children‚Äôs health on test scores and attendance. Each of the randomized evaluations of APRESt are large scale studies that cover thousands of students, schools, and households. Over the past five years of APRESt, almost 150,000 students have taken an exam designed by Educational Initiatives and administered by APRESt.  Projects  Incentives & Inputs: This project aims to understand how performance pay and inputs into rural government schools impact the educational outcomes of students. Initially, the Incentives & Inputs study randomly selected 400 schools and provided one of the following to groups of 100 schools:Azim Premji Foundation, APRESt (Research Test Bed in Andhra Pradesh), , ', 9 December 2009 * Bonuses based on the gains of students' test scores of each teacher individually. * Bonuses based on the gains of all students' test scores in the school. * Provision of a contract teacher to assist teaching students in schools * Provision of a block grant that allows the school to provide classroom materials for students. Another 100 schools were selected as a control group. In these 100 control schools, the schools received none of the aforementioned treatments, but were administered the same exam as the treatment schools. Several studies have been based on data collected from the Incentives & Inputs study including a recent paper on performance pay for teachers.Center of Evaluation for Global Action, Teacher performance pay in Andhra Pradesh, India, , , 21 December 2009 Marginal Revolution, Teacher Performance Pay: Experimental Evidence from India, 30 September 2009 , , 9 December 2009 AP School Choice (APSC): The APSC project was implemented to understand the growing explosion of private schools in rural India. A paper by Karthik Muralidharan of University of California, San Diego and Michael Kremer of Harvard University shows that private schools in rural India appear to perform better than government schools across several measures.Muralidharan and Kremer, Private and Public Schools in Rural India, 1 September 2007, http://econ.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/public%20and%20private%20schools%20in%20rural%20india.pdf , 9 December 2009 However, little rigorous evidence has been amassed to show whether private schools actually do improve the academic outcomes of students better than government schools. The APSC Project initiated a scholarship program to provide interested households the opportunity to send their child to the school of their choice. Since the scholarship program received more applicants than number of scholarship available, applicants were randomly allocated the scholarship. Over the course of five years, all students in the villages where the scholarship program took place will be administered a test each year to observe whether the private schools actually improve the test scores of students.Azim Premji Foundation, APRESt (Research Test Bed in Andhra Pradesh), , ', 9 December 2009 School Health: This project aims to investigate how improving the nutrition and health of students in rural India impacts academic outcomes.

Timothy Quinn Brenton (February 9, 1970 - October 31, 2009)Officer Brenton‚Äôs biography, an officer with the Seattle Police Department, was seated in a parked patrol car with another officer discussing a traffic stop when a gunman stopped his vehicle alongside the patrol car, opened fire on both officers, and fled the scene. Brenton died at the scene and his partner sustained minor injuries. One week later, as a public memorial service for Brenton was being held at KeyArena, the gunman was apprehended and seriously wounded after being shot by police officers in Tukwila. The shooting is believed to have been a targeted attack against police officers in general, not against either officer individually. The suspect arrested in connection with the murder, Christopher Monfort, was also charged in connection with the October 22, 2009, firebombing of Seattle police vehicles at a city maintenance facility. No clear motive was established but he had left fliers discussing police brutality, and had expressed opinions against wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was accused of being a terrorist who waged a \\"one man war\\" against the police by authorities. Victims One Seattle Police Department (SPD) officer was killed and another injured. They were: *Field Training Officer Timothy Brenton, 39, of Marysville, Served nine years with SPD, Brenton Previously worked as a Police Officer for the both La Conner Police Department and Hoquiam Police Department, and a veteran of the United States Army and the Gulf War, killed in the attack. He graduated from West Seattle High School and Spokane Community College and had two children. *Trainee Officer Britt Sweeney, 33, of Seattle, one month with SPD, injured in the attack.  Incident  On the night of October 31, 2009, at approximately 10:00 pm Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7), Brenton and his partner, trainee officer Britt Sweeney, were sitting in their patrol car following a traffic stop at 29th Avenue South and East Yesler Way in the Central District. Sweeney was sitting in the driver's seat with Brenton in the passenger seat. As they were discussing the traffic stop they had just performed, a vehicle pulled up alongside their police car and someone inside opened fire with a rifle. Sweeney ducked, and a bullet grazed the top of her head and her back. Brenton, meanwhile, was mortally wounded in the attack. The suspect's vehicle reversed, turned around, and fled the scene in the direction from which it had come. As the vehicle was fleeing the scene, Sweeney managed to call for help, exit the patrol car, and return fire. Seattle's police chief called the attack an assassination, as well as an act of domestic terrorism. Several days after the shooting, a suspicious vehicle was identified as having been seen on dashboard cameras of other police vehicles in the area of the shooting. A public memorial service was held for Brenton on November 6. The memorial began with a procession of police and fire vehicles from the University of Washington campus to KeyArena, where a public ceremony was held. As the ceremony was concluding, officers with the Seattle and Tukwila police departments and King County Sheriff's Office confronted Christopher Monfort, age 41, the owner of a vehicle matching the description of the suspicious vehicle in the parking lot of a Tukwila apartment complex. Monfort brandished a 9mm Glock handgun and attempted to flee into his apartment. When he brandished the weapon again, the pursuing officers opened fire, seriously wounding him. Monfort was taken to Harborview Medical Center and his family has stated that he was paralyzed from the waist down.  Perpetrator  The shooter was identified as Christopher John Monfort (born 1968; died January 18, 2017).Self-doubts troubled suspect in killing of officer  The Seattle Times At the time of the incidents, Monfort had no criminal record in Washington, and had graduated from Highline Community College and the University of Washington and studied law enforcement. Police said that upon entering Monfort's apartment, they found three rifles (a 7mm Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle, an FN Model 1949 semi-automatic rifle and a 7.62x39mm Inter Ordnance of America M59/66 semi-automatic rifle w/ fixed bayonet), a Mossberg 590 12-gauge shotgun, a .45-caliber Auto-Ordnance 1911 pistol, homemade explosives, booby traps and a barricade of tires. Investigators also found to have matched ballistics between a rifle found in Monfort's apartment and the bullets used in the attack on Brenton and Sweeney. They also found evidence connecting Monfort with the firebombing of multiple police vehicles at a Seattle city maintenance facility on October 22, 2009, in which prosecutors claim he was planning to kill police officers. Police also claim to have a DNA match for Monfort found on the flags left at the firebombing scene and the murder scene. On 5th June 2015, Monfort was convicted of murder, two counts of attempted murder, and one count of arson by a King County Jury. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Constantine Stephanidis, (Ed.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2001, Accessed 2019-05-14. Design for All is design for human diversity (such as that described in the diversity in the workplace or business), social inclusion and equality.EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004 It should not be conceived of as an effort to advance a single solution for everybody, but as a user-centred approach to providing products that can automatically address the possible range of human abilities, skills, requirements, and preferences. Consequently, the outcome of the design process is not intended to be a singular design, but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives, together with the rationale underlying each alternative, that is, the specific user and usage context characteristics for which each alternative has been designed. Traditionally, accessibility problems have been solved with adaptations and the use of assistive technology products has been a technical approach to obtain adaptations. Universal Access implies the accessibility and usability of information and telecommunications technologies by anyone at any place and at any time and their inclusion in any living context. It aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all people in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities, by developing universally accessible and usable products and services and suitable support functionalities in the environment. These products and services must be capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use, independent of location, target machine, or runtime environment. Therefore, the approach aiming to grant the use of equipment or services is generalized, seeking to give access to the Information Society as such. Citizens are supposed to live in environments populated with intelligent objects, where the tasks to be performed and the way of performing them are completely redefined, involving a combination of activities of access to information, interpersonal communication, and environmental control. Citizens must be given the possibility of carrying them out easily and pleasantly. For a thorough discussion of the challenges and benefits of Design for All in the context of ICT, see also the EDeAN White Paper (2005)EDeAN White Paper: promoting Design for All and e-Accessibility in Europe, Accessed 2009-10-05. and the \\"Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility\\"Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility , Accessed 2009-10-05. of the DfA@eInclusion project.DfA@eInclusion project website , Accessed 2009-10-05.

In that respect, the challenges that need to be addressed include: * the introduction of specific legislative measures to complement and enhance existing legislation, * addressing and motivating the industry, * effective benchmarking, * providing harmonised standardisation, * the creation of a curriculum for DfA and, * addressing future research activities. Legislative and regulative background The present policy context of accessibility in the Information Society in Europe is the i2010 initiative.The i2010 initiative website, Accessed 2009-10-05. The \\"i2010 ‚Äì A European Information Society for growth and employment\\" initiative was launched by the European Commission as a framework for addressing the main challenges and developments in the information society and media sectors up to 2010. It promotes an open and competitive digital economy and emphasises ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. The initiative contains a range of EU policy instruments to encourage the development of the digital economy, such as regulatory instruments, research and partnerships with stakeholders. =Equality and non-discrimination= The goal of the European Union Disability Strategy is a society that is open and accessible to all. The barriers need to be identified and removed. The European Union Disability Strategy has three main focuses: co-operation between the Commission and the Member States, full participation of people with disabilities, and mainstreaming disability in policy formulation. Non-discrimination is also one of the general principles of the \\"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\\",Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Accessed 2009-10-05. adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006 and was opened for signatures on 30 March 2007. =Telecommunications and information society= There is a long tradition of European legislation with regard to telecommunications. In 2002, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, covering all forms of fixed and wireless telecoms, data transmission and broadcasting. From a Design for All perspective, the most important Directives are the Directive on a common regulatory frameworkDirective 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), Accessed 2009-10-05. and the Directive on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and servicesDirective 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) [Official Journal L 108 of 24 April 2002], Accessed 2009-10-05. (Universal Service Directive). =Public procurement= Public procurement is an important economic force, and therefore it is an important tool to promote accessibility. The legislative package of public procurement Directives, approved in 2004 by the European Parliament and the EU's Council of Ministers, will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures. The new directives make it possible to take accessibility needs into account at several stages of a procurement process. It is most convenient to refer to standards when making technical specifications. There are already many CEN, ETSI and ITU standards which can be used for this purpose and many sources which can be useful in practice. Likewise, guidelines like the WAI guidelines, for example, or national guidelines have been used. In the future it will be easier to find suitable standards. Mandate M/376European Commission Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General (2005): Standardisation Mandate to CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI in support of European accessibility requirements for public procurement of products and services in the ICT domain, Accessed 2009-10-09. has been given by the European Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, to come up with a solution for common requirements and conformance assessment. =Copyright= Not all products are accessible for persons with disabilities. When producing audio books, or certain other accessible works, an additional copy is created, and copyright can be a problem in this situation. On the other hand, copyright is an essential part of the sustainability of a creative society. This conflict of interests must be solved somehow in order to ensure the Information Society is a Society for All. There is international and European legislation in this field. The objectives of the Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information societyDirective 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society., Accessed 2009-10-05. are to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to reflect technological developments and to transpose into Community law the main international obligations arising from the two treaties on copyright and related rights adopted within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)World Intellectual Property Organisation, Accessed 2009-10-05. in December 1996. =Protection of privacy= The relationship between design and privacy is not necessarily obvious. Modern technology, which is a result of design, is able to collect significant amounts of personal information. The user has an interest in that information being correct and in it being used appropriately. The person may want to keep something confidential and have access to the information that has been collected. In other words, privacy is desired. In 1995 the European Union adopted a Directive on the processing of personal data.Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), Accessed 2009-10-05. This directive established the basic principles for the collection, storage and use of personal data which should be respected by governments, businesses and any other organizations or individuals engaged in handling personal data. Within the context of Design for All (in ICT), privacy protection is called Privacy by Design. Relevant guidelines and standards In the US, Australia, Japan and in the European Union more and more legislative actions are put in place to require public bodies and companies to make sure that their products and services are accessible and usable not only by ‚Äústandard‚Äù users but also by others such as elderly persons or people with an impairment. As it would be unwise to write down technical ‚Äì and therefore time-bound ‚Äì requirements into a law, legislative texts preferably refer to (international) standards. =Standardisation: general overview= Standardisation, i.e., in very general terms, producing a \\"standard\\" (French: ; German: ; Spanish: ) is a voluntary action set up in the past, almost uniquely, by commercial partners who believe that the standardisation will permit easier exchanges of products and goods. This implied very often that the acceptance of the standards is also voluntary and triggered by expected commercial benefits. Only to a very limited extent consumer representatives did participate in standardisation. On the other hand, laws in many countries are referring more and more to the required acceptance of several standards (e.g. on safety or on ecological aspects). The net result of this need for standards is that nowadays many standardisation initiatives are stimulated (= subsidised) by public bodies or, in Europe, directly and indirectly by the European Commission.

Application domains The application domains of Design for All in the context of ICT, practically include every field involving Information and Communication Technologies. The significance of the application domains reflects their role in establishing a coherent and socially acceptable Information Society, but also the diverse range of human activities affected. The critical application domains for Design for All, can be summarised as follows: * Life-long learning * Public information systems, terminals and information appliances (e.g. kiosks, smart home environments) * Transaction services (e.g., banking) * Electronic commerce applications and services * Social services for the citizens (e.g., administration, elderly, transport, health care, awareness) * Tools to allow for added-value information services (e.g., creation, storage, retrieval and exchange of user experiences, traces and views) * Security The White Paper \\"Toward an Information Society for All: An International R&D; Agenda\\" (1998)Stephanidis, C.

Professionals are needed who have acquired comprehensive specialist knowledge and skills in Design for All; in addition those professionals who currently work in ICT industry need to acquire additional knowledge and skills concerning Design for All. Little evidence can be found of university degree programmes that specialize in Design for All (or Universal Design) or that explicitly includes a module about this.Whitney G, Keith S (2008) European Developments in the Design and Implementation of Training for eInclusion.

Modern accessible elevators use information and communication technology to adapt themselves to any user imaginable. The closing speed of the doors is adjustable so people can safely enter quickly or slowly as required. Controls of the elevator provide visual and audible feedback to the user so that people with different sensory abilities can operate the elevator without assistance. Blind people profit from tactile keys. Braille labeling is located besides the keys so that they are not accidentally pushed while reading them. The emergency intercom system operates aurally and visually.

McIntosh, published in July 1971 by Avon Books. Plot Modern science has discovered a way to rejuvenate people. It is just like immortality, but the rejuvenation process causes the human brain to be \\"restarted\\"-effectively losing all its former memories so the recipient starts life anew, like a blank slate. The world has reached a stage where there is very little privacy, and the rigors of modern society invade just about every corner of life. Even still, there are outcasts in remote areas who find a way of surviving without being part of the wider society. The main character, Benny Rice, struggles to maintain a low profile, even going so far as to quit and change jobs when offered a promotion; his personal history mysteriously dates back to a series of dead ends. No matter what job he has had, he always quits before getting promoted. An amicable, friendly sort, he is in for quite a surprise when an unlikely friend, a multi-billionairess, is so taken with his gentleness and kindness that she decides to write him into her will as the principal co-beneficiary to her vast estate of billions. The \\"Trust\\" is a foundation that encourages the successful, the accomplished, and the intelligent--basically the cream of the crop--to undergo the rejuvenation process. However, her will requires the Rejuvenation Foundation give Benny exactly the same treatment reserved to the successful and rich. Public notoriety is exactly what Benny Rice does not want. He only wants to be left alone and allowed to go on with his quiet and peaceful life in a position in life that is least subject to public scrutiny.

The church is one of only 15 in England dedicated to St Peter ad Vincula (\\"St Peter in Chains\\"), after the basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. Building In the late Norman period South Newington's church had a nave of two bays, plus a north aisle and a chancel. Features that survive form this period include a pair of Norman arches between the nave and north aisle. At the end of the 13th century the church was enlarged in a Decorated Gothic style. The nave was extended with an extra bay in each direction, absorbing the Norman chancel. A new chancel further east, a south aisle and a west tower were all added in the same period. In the second half of the 15th century a clerestory and ornate south porch were added. The tower had a clock by 1560. The present clock was formerly at St. Mary's parish church, Banbury, was made by Joseph Hemmins of Banbury in 1741 and was moved to St. Peter ad Vincula in 1895. The tower had several bells by the 16th century. It now has a ring of five bells hung for change ringing. The oldest of the bells, the second, was cast in 1656 by Richard Keene of Woodstock. The treble was cast in 1733 by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe. The third, fourth and fifth were cast in 1861 by George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers, Banbury Branch: South Newington Wall paintings Wall painting of Martydom of St. Thomas Becket, 1330's Around 1330‚Äì40 a set of wall paintings were painted in the north aisle. The medium is oil on plaster, which Sherwood and Pevsner state is unusual for mediaeval wall paintings. Prof. Ernest Tristram described the paintings as \\"of a nature seldom found in a parish church\\" and Sherwood and Pevsner considered them to be \\"the finest group of medieval wall paintings in [Oxfordshire]\\". Another author commented: > \\"The north aisle paintings at South Newington are indeed outstanding for > their draughtsmanship, wide range and skilful blending of colours, and also > for the medium, which is oil; nothing in this part of the country can > compare with them for excellence. The unknown artist must have been in the > front rank of his profession. The paintings in the north aisle include a damaged but very fine depiction of the murder of St. Thomas Becket. Next to it is a painting of a rare subject, the execution of Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster. The east end of the north aisle forms a Lady Chapel whose wall paintings include an Annunciation and an exquisite Virgin and Child. Next to the Virgin and Child is a painting of St. James receiving a gift, and beside the east window of the Lady Chapel is one of St. Margaret the Virgin slaying a dragon. The inclusion of a Margaret and two Thomases in the paintings, and the Giffard coat of arms in the Annunciation and St. James paintings suggests that they were commissioned by Thomas Giffard, lord of one of the manors of South Newington, and his wife Margaret Mortayne.A Guide to St Peter ad Vincula South Newington, page 3 Over the chancel arch there are fragments of a Doom painting from the same period, but very little of it has survived. Wall painting of the Virgin Mary & infant Jesus, 1330's Late in the 15th or early in the 16th century, after the clerestory was built, a Passion Cycle was painted in the nave above the arches to the north aisle. Its artistry is not of the same standard as the paintings in the north aisle, but it is of interest and some of its pictures show scenes not seen in passion cycles elsewhere. All the paintings in St. Peter ad Vincula had been hidden under whitewash for several centuries. Those in the north aisle and over the chancel arch were uncovered in 1893, and the Passion cycle in the nave was uncovered in 1931. Benefice St. Peter ad Vincula was granted to the Benedictine abbey at Eynsham in the 1160s, and remained one of its possessions until the abbey was suppressed in the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. In 1565 the advowson was passed to Exeter College, Oxford, which retained it until 1979. St. Peter ad Vincula is now part of a single Church of England benefice with the parishes of Bloxham and Milcombe.

Their third album was released in 2018 on The Artisan Era. History Although the idea to create the band had been in discussions between members since they met in 1997, the actual formation of Augury did not take place until 2002 when lead guitarist Mathieu Marcotte left his former band, Spasme, and began to audition drummers. He was soon joined by Dominic \\"Forest\\" Lapointe of Atheretic fame on bass, and Arianne Fleury on vocals. Vocalist and guitarist Patrick Loisel joined in February 2002 after taking leave of his former band, Kralizec. Former drummer of Adenine, Mathieu Groulx joined the band in June 2002 and completed the line-up. With this line-up, Augury wrote their first six songs and played their first show, but soon Mathieu Groulx departed due to a lack of time and different musical taste. The band, however, continued to write more songs and began to add strings to their compositions. Soon after, √âtienne Gallo joined as a drummer and in September 2004 their debut album Concealed was recorded and released by Galy Records. Although work began on the second album soon after the release of Concealed, it was spread over four years due to line-up changes. In 2006, drummer √âtienne Gallo left and Augury decided to work with another drummer for a year, but scheduling problems led to Gallo being called back. Gallo learned all the songs and helped record them, but since it was a temporary situation, drummer Antoine Baril was recruited. Mathieu Marcotte said of the delay \\"..for sure we would have wished to release the album before, but we made a good out of the bad and we perfected the songs and added more details to them.\\" The band also diversified their sound since Patrick, Forest, and Mathieu each wrote a third of the album. It was during the writing process for their second album that Nuclear Blast was introduced to Augury by Kataklysm, who had heard a few Augury songs online. Impressed, they signed Augury onto the label and let them retain their sound. Fragmentary Evidence was released in July and August 2009 in Europe and North America respectively. Due to songs like \\"Jupiter to Ignite\\" and \\"Oversee the Rebirth\\" being very layered, complex and lengthy, Augury do not play the former and only play the first half of the latter. Between the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, the band parted ways with drummer Antoine Baril and long-time bassist Dominic \\"Forest\\" Lapointe. Former Neuraxis drummer Tommy McKinnon (who joined full-time since then) and MAG bassist Christian Pacaud were recruited as temporary replacements for The American Defloration North American tour with The Black Dahlia Murder, Obscura, and Hatesphere. As of 2013 Both √âtienne Gallo and Dominic \\"Forest\\" Lapointe are back in the band, and are working with Augury on a new album.

He was born on 20 November 1895 in Z√°borƒç√≠, some 17 kilometres south east of Liberec, and died on 7 February 1977 in Putney, London. Early life Li≈°ka was one of six siblings. In June 1914, he passed the leaving examination and graduated from Grammar School in Turnov. Military service In 1915, during World War I, Li≈°ka was conscripted into the Austro‚ÄìHungarian Army and posted to the Russian front. He was taken prisoner of war (one source says that he defected) in 1916 on the Russian front and in 1917 he volunteered to join the Czechoslovak Legions in Russia and served with the artillery. After his return, in 1920, to Czechoslovakia, he joined the Army as a professional officer and served with the 51st Artillery Regiment at Star√° Boleslav, rising from a company commander to commanding the regiment. When Germany occupied the Czech lands in 1939, he escaped the country. During the Battle of France, he commanded the 1st Artillery Regiment and, after the collapse of Allied forces in 1940, he and his regiment were evacuated to Britain. In 1943, Li≈°ka was promoted to Brigadier General and, from March 1943, he commanded the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade, which subsequently converted to armour as the Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group, which subsequently became the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade. The Brigade was moved to France in August 1944 and Li≈°ka commanded the siege of Dunkirk from October 1944 to May 1945, accepting the surrender of the German garrison. Post-war After the war, Li≈°ka returned to Czechoslovakia where he was reunited with his wife and daughter who had been repatriated from concentration camps; his son, Jaroslav, and older brother, Josef, had been shot during death marches. He had been appointed as the Czechoslovak Army's Chief of Staff in April 1945 by President Edvard Bene≈°, but this was vetoed by the Soviet authorities and instead he became commander of the Military College and was promoted to General in 1946. The Communist takeover in 1948 and consequent purges of formerly London-based officers, however, led to his dismissal from the Army and obliged him to leave his country once again, without his family.

As of 2009 both vessels remain in service. It is an upgraded version of the Rade Konƒçar missile boat class and is 8.5 meters longer. Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV and its sister ship Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir are the only ships in their class. A potential third ship was under consideration in 1999, but the ship was never commissioned due to budget restraints. Kralj means \\"king\\" in Croatian - both vessels are named after historic kings of Croatia.  Development and building  The Kralj class was developed by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb for the Yugoslav Navy as a successor to the Konƒçar-class missile boats. The project was started during the 1980s but was reported as suspended in 1989 only to be restarted again in 1991. The first ship in the new class was to have a pennant number RTOP-501 and named Sergej Ma≈°era after Sergej Ma≈°era, an officer of the Royal Yugoslav Navy who died preventing the destroyer Zagreb from falling in Italian hands during Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The new class was also referred to as the Kobra class or Type 400 in some sources. Compared to the earlier Konƒçar class, the new class was to have a longer hull and an all-diesel propulsion unlike the Konƒçars which were equipped with a CODAG type of propulsion. The new class was also to be the first in Yugoslav service to be equipped with Swedish RBS-15 anti-ship missiles which were acquired in 1988 and 1989. At the start of the Croatian War of Independence, the first ship in the class was nearing completion at the Kraljevica Shipyard. The unfinished ship was captured by Croatian forces and was subsequently commissioned with the Croatian Navy as Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV. (RTOP-11). A second, slightly modified ship was laid down by Croatia during the 1990s and commissioned in the early 2000s as Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir (RTOP-12).

It was originally developed by Nos√© and was improved further by Hoover. Although the heat bath of Nos√©‚ÄìHoover thermostat consists of only one imaginary particle, simulation systems achieve realistic constant-temperature condition (canonical ensemble). Therefore, the Nos√©‚ÄìHoover thermostat has been commonly used as one of the most accurate and efficient methods for constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Introduction In classic molecular dynamics, simulations are done in the microcanonical ensemble; a number of particles, volume, and energy have a constant value. In experiments, however, the temperature is generally controlled instead of the energy. The ensemble of this experimental condition is called a canonical ensemble. Importantly, the canonical ensemble is different from microcanonical ensemble from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics. Several methods have been introduced to keep the temperature constant while using the microcanonical ensemble. Popular techniques to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the Andersen thermostat, the Nos√©‚ÄìHoover thermostat, Nos√©‚ÄìHoover chains, the Berendsen thermostat and Langevin dynamics. The central idea is to simulate in such a way that we obtain a canonical ensemble, where we fix the particle number N, the volume V and the temperature T. This means that these three quantities are fixed and do not fluctuate. The temperature of the system is connected to the average kinetic energy via the equation: :\\\\langle E_\\\\mathrm{kin} \\\\rangle=\\\\frac{3}{2} N k_\\\\mathrm{B}T . Although the temperature and the average kinetic energy are fixed, the instantaneous kinetic energy fluctuates (and with it the velocities of the particles).  The Nos√©‚ÄìHoover thermostat  In the approach of Nos√©, a Hamiltonian with an extra degree of freedom for heat bath, s, is introduced; \\\\mathcal{H} (P,R,p_s,s) = \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2ms^2} + \\\\frac12 \\\\sum_{ij,i ot= j} U \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{r_i} - \\\\mathbf{r_j}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{p_s^2}{2Q} + gkT\\\\ln\\\\left( s\\\\right) , where g is the number of independent momentum degrees of freedom of the system, R and P represent all coordinates \\\\mathbf{r_i} and \\\\mathbf{p_i} and Q is an imaginary mass which should be chosen carefully along with systems. The coordinates R, P and t in this Hamiltonian are virtual. They are related to the real coordinates as follows: R'=R,~ P'=\\\\frac{P}{s} ~\\\\text{and}~t'=\\\\int^t \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau}{s}, where the coordinates with an accent are the real coordinates. The ensemble average of the above Hamiltonian at g=3N is equal to the canonical ensemble average. Hoover (1985) used the phase-space continuity equation, a generalized Liouville equation, to establish what is now known as the Nos√©‚ÄìHoover thermostat. This approach does not require the scaling of the time (or, in effect, of the momentum) by s. The Nos√©‚ÄìHoover algorithm is nonergodic for a single harmonic oscillator. In simple terms, it means that the algorithm fails to generate a canonical distribution for a single harmonic oscillator. This feature of the Nos√©‚ÄìHoover algorithm has prompted the development of newer thermostatting algorithms‚Äîthe kinetic moments method that controls the first two moments of the kinetic energy, Bauer‚ÄìBulgac‚ÄìKusnezov scheme, Nos√©‚ÄìHoover chains, etc. Using similar method, other techniques like the Braga‚ÄìTravis configurational thermostat and the Patra‚ÄìBhattacharya full phase thermostat have been proposed.

The oldest parts of the structure date back to the 8th century, and significant additions were made in the 18th century. The stepwell consists of three flight of stairs descending into the earth with a subterranean palace on one side. The flight of stairs and the palace are arranged in a square pattern with the well lying at the bottom. The flight of steps descends thirteen stories. The Harshat Mata Temple is located near the Chand Baori. It was a ritual to wash hands and feet at Chand Baori before visiting the temple. It is dedicated to Harshat Mata, the goddess of joy and happiness.

The units are mostly stationed in La R√©union and Djibouti. ALINDIEN is tasked with the operational control of the naval forces deployed in his area, unless they are detached with their own general staff. This command is exercised from a command and replenishment oiler (BCR) carrying the entire general staff.

This musical project is unique in Chile, and its hybrid sound has been called \\"klezmer a la chilena\\" by press.Review of the album \\"La Mano Ajena\\" in El Mercurio Online, the main Chilean newspaper, where this term is used by the first time in press Its first references were Jazz manouche, Klezmer, Balkan and Gypsy music, rhythms to which later they would incorporate Latin influences like Cumbia, Mambo, Cha-cha-cha, Tango and Rumba; creating a cosmopolitan sonority. From its beginning, the band was a precursor in spreading the Gypsy, Balkan and Klezmer rhythms in Chilean stages; and today, after almost a decade, they are one of the most important and celebrated bands from the so called ‚Äúnew culture of musical carnival‚Äù that has taken place in Chile in the last years. La Mano Ajena has played in many stages abroad and inside of Chile, in countries as Denmark, Spain, Serbia and Argentina. In Santiago, they have shared stage with bands as Gogol Bordello and Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra. In January, 2009, they became the first and only Latin American band to participate in the K√ºstendorf Film and Music Festival in Serbia, created by the twice Palm d‚ÄôOr winner in Cannes and world famous filmmaker Emir Kusturica, whose band The No Smoking Orchestra is the main and most important reference concerning Balkan and Gypsy music in the world. La Mano Ajena incorporates in its work a traditional repertoire sung in diverse languages: Gypsy language, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, English and Spanish. Its members are 8 multi-instrumentalists: Rodrigo Latorre, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, guitar, piccolo flute, keyboard and theremin; Mar√≠a Fernanda Carrasco, vocals, keyboard, melodica and minor percussion; Danka Villanueva, violin and marimba; Gabriel Moyla, accordion, alto saxophone and baritone saxophone; Jair Moreno, clarinet; √Ålvaro S√°ez, drums, darbuka and djembe; and Cristian Aqueveque, electric bass and double bass.

On that same year, their first album was released in Spain by the Fundaci√≥n Autor record company. In 2008, on their second European tour, they played 19 times in different Danish cities. On November 2009, La Mano Ajena opened the concert of the world famous New York gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello, on their first visit to Chile. In Chile, they have played in some of the most important stages of the country, and their versatility has led them to create original music and songs for television shows. In 2009, they participated in ‚ÄúLeche para Hait√≠‚Äù a charity concert created to raise funds for children in Hait√≠; and they were part of the cultural program ‚ÄúCreando Chile en mi barrio‚Äù (‚ÄúCreating Chile in my neighborhood‚Äù), organized by the Chilean Ministry of Culture, where, as a cultural delegation, they travelled around the country playing in different stages, recording new tracks, teaching lessons and sharing their experiences with new musicians and bands from different corners of Chile. In 2010, they created the Music School Escuela Ajena, in which all the band members shared their musical knowledge with children, teenagers and adults. This idea was related to the band's interest for teaching to younger generations specially, and it was also a result of the musicians' social concerns.

The term has been used since 1998, and was added to the The Australian National Dictionary in 2018. Ideology Hansonism has been described as a form of right-wing populism. A common theme within Hansonism is the idea that \\"multiculturalist elite\\" are manipulating \\"hardworking Australians\\" into supporting certain policies, such as Indigenous land rights. Hansonism believes that rights for minority groups, such as for Indigenous Australians, are forms of reverse racism and are anti- equality. A key feature of Hansonism is the support of economic nationalism and the opposition to economic rationalism. Hanson has supported the re- introduction of tariffs, establishing government-run bank, renewing local manufacturing, and is critical multinational corporations. In 1998, Kukathas and Maley identified two strands of Hansonism: Soft Hansonism, and Hard Hansonism. Hard Hansonism refers to the policies directly supported by Hanson, such as anti-Asian sentiment, an attachment to the White Australia Policy, criticism of multiculturalism, and the populism view that these policies are associated with \\"the people\\". Soft Hansonism is associated with Hansonist policies that take a milder form or are promoted by non-One Nation members, such as opposition to asylum seekers or the views of Graeme Campbell. Critical reception Academic Tod Moore interprets Hansonism as a reaction against the rise of neoliberalism and globalism, inspired by both fear and anger, and that it has been adopted by blue-collar and middle class Australians due to the acceptance of neoliberalism by the Australian Labor Party. However, Moore critiqued Hansonism as contradictory as the policies would ultimately lead to policies he believes as harmful to those groups, such as \\"smaller government, fewer public amenities, more financial deregulation, weaker unions, and greater wealth inequality\\". Milton Osborne, in 1999, noted that research found that Hanson's initial supporters did not find Asian immigration a major reason for their support, but instead they were most concerned about economic deregulation and unemployment. Osborne also argues that her support of substantial tax cuts undermined support for Hansonism, leading to her initially leaving parliament.

Cause The book was written after the first reading in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Benn's Commonwealth of Britain Bill in 1991. It includes the full text of the bill as an appendix. The main content of the book discusses the reasoning behind the Bill. Benn wrote an article, summarizing the book's contents, published in Keith Sutherland's book The Rape of the Constitution? (2000). The Bill proposed establishing the United Kingdom as a secular state and thus disestablishing the Church of England, removing the British Crown as an element of government, but continuing government with democratically elected members from constituencies, each seat electing a male and a female. Various other reforms were proposed along liberal lines, such as a single age of consent, abolition of blasphemy laws, and equal rights in law for homosexuals. The introduction of the Bill was intended more for public discussion than with any real hope that it would become law.

Separate versions exist for Indonesian and non- Indonesian residents. The card is issued upon reaching the age of 17 or upon marriage. In the case of Indonesian citizens, the card is valid for lifetime (previously it only valid for 5 years for citizens under 60 years old). For non-Indonesian citizens, the card's expiry date is the same as that of their residency permit. Since 2011, the Indonesian governments has issued an electronic ID card, the e-KTP (KTP elektronik), which contains a modern embedded microchip. History =Dutch East Indies= The general identity card during the Dutch colonial era was called a residence certificate (Dutch: verklaring van ingezetenschap). This card did not record the bearer's religion. Citizens seeking to obtain proof of residence were required to contact their local controleur (controller) and pay a fee of 1.5 guilders. The paper card measuring 15x10 cm was issued and signed by heads of local administrations (hoofd van plaatselijk). Two additional types of ID documents were required by Chinese in the Dutch East Indies: the entry permit (Dutch: toelatingskaart) and the residency permit (vergunning tot vestiging, known as ongji by Chinese). =Japanese period= The Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì45) ID card was made from paper and was much wider than the current KTP. It featured Japanese and Indonesian text. Behind the main data section was a propaganda spiel that indirectly required the holder to swear allegiance to the Japanese invaders. Hence it became known as KTP-Propaganda. =First 32 years of independence= An Indonesian identity card issued in 1958. After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, the certificate of residence was replaced with the Indonesian Citizenship Certificate (Surat Tanda Kewarganegaraan Indonesia). This document was partly typed and partly handwritten. It was in use from 1945 to 1977. It was a paper card without any laminate. The card underwent several changes during this period, partly concerning the rights and responsibilities of the bearer. Different ID cards were issued by different regions and eventually became uniform under the head of Population Registration in 1976. =Discrimination= During Suharto‚Äôs New Order regime (1966‚Äì98), citizenship cards held by former political prisoners (tahanan politik or tapol) and ethnic Chinese featured special codes to denote their status. This policy allowed government officials to know whether a person was a former political prisoner or of Chinese descent. The discriminatory codes were later abandoned. =1977-2003 KTP= The KTP was made from paper, laminated in plastic and stamped with an ink stamp. Cards were issued by the lowest neighborhood administrative levels, known as RT and RW. The cards featured a photo, signature, serial number and thumb print. The background color of the KTP was often yellow. =Aceh Emergency KTP= When Aceh province was placed under a state of Military Emergency in 2003, it had a different KTP design featuring a red and white background and a garuda bird. The card was signed by the subdistrict head, the local military commander and head of police. =2004-2011 KTP= The bearer‚Äôs photo was printed directly onto a plastic card. Surveillance, verification and validation remained at the RT/RW levels. This KTP featured the bearer‚Äôs thumb print and a unique serial number. Electronic KTP (e-KTP) The e-KTP was trialed in six areas in 2009 and launched nationwide in 2011. The card is supposed to be more durable, contains a microchip, unique serial number and can be used for multiple applications for government services.In May 2013, it was reported the chip inside the e-KTP could be damaged and rendered useless by repeatedly photocopying the card. The e-KTP contains unique biometric data and was designed to improve government services and population databases, while reducing fraud and security threats. The e-KTP is the basis for the issuance of Indonesian passports, driving licenses (SIM), Taxpayer Identification Numbers (NPWP), insurance policies, land ownership certificates and other identity documents (Article 13 of Law no. 23 year 2006 on Adminduk). Data recording for e-KTP registration involves taking fingerprints from all 10 fingers, although the card's chip records only the right thumb and index finger prints. The e-KTP consists of nine layers to increase security. A chip is implanted between white and transparent plastic on the top two layers. The chip has an antenna that issues a wave when swiped. The wave will be recognized by a detector to verify whether the rightful holder is using the card. Data storage in the chip is in accordance with international standards and NISTIR 7123 Machine Readable Travel Documents ICAO and EU Passport 9303 Specification 2006. The size of the card is in accordance with ISO/IEC 7810 with a credit card size form factor that is 53.98 mm x 85.60 mm. Indonesia's e-KTP program achieved 100 million biometric enrollments and de-duplications in just under one year.http://www.planetbiometrics.com/article-details/i/1261/ e-KTP data has no expiration date, even if the cards show expiration dates. Religion The card requires identification with one of the six officially recognised religions in Indonesia: Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. In 2006 the need to retain this arrangement was reiterated by Minister of Religious Affairs Maftuh Basyuni: \\"official religions of the country is vital to ensuring good harmony between religious groups as well as being of use in more practical matters such as marriage and burial.\\"KTP Religion, indonesiamatters.com, May 8th, 2006 But in 2014, the Minister of Home Affairs suggested that the section should be optional, that is, that it could be left blank.

The next morning, HMS Hyacinth and HMS Larne got underway towards the bay near the Barrier Gate. The Bengal Volunteers were embarked on board the Enterprise while nine boats filled with marines and seamen followed in the wake of the other ships.Davis 1841, p. 302 The Hyacinth and Larne, accompanied by the cutter Louisa and Enterprise, having seamen and marines of the Druid with Bengal Volunteers on board, attacked the barrier.Bingham 1843, pp. 398‚Äì399 Lord Henry John Spencer-Churchill, son of the 5th Duke of Marlborough and the great-great-grand uncle of Winston Churchill, commanded the Druid until his death in Macao on 2 June 1840 from dysentery.Urban 1841, p. 92Ride 1963, p. 18 These vessels stood in Fisherman's Bay, as close to the shore as the depth of water would allow.

Yi Zhongfu, the intendant of Gaolian circuit in Guangdong, was stationed in Macao with his troops. They advanced north from Macao while reinforcements advanced south from Beishan, with both groups reinforcing the Chinese flanks in the middle. The Portuguese were officially neutral and took no action during the engagement. A British officer wrote: \\"The [Chinese] junks, which were aground in the inner harbour, were utterly useless, for none of their guns could be brought to bear, though several of the thirty-two pound shots of the ships found their way over the bank, much to the consternation of the occupants of the junks.\\" In less than an hour, the batteries were silenced and the British forces were landed. It consisted of 110 marines under Lieutenant William Robert Maxwell, 90 seamen from the Druid under Lieutenant George Goldsmith, and 180 Bengal Volunteers, forming a 380-man brigade under Captain Mee of the latter corps. A field piece from the Druid was placed on the beach, raking the Chinese position. By 5:00 pm, the routing was complete, and the barracks and tents were set on fire.

The lido, also known as Hampstead Heath Lido, is a public unheated open air swimming pool, open for 12 months a year. It first opened in 1938. Description This unheated pool is and is owned and operated by the Corporation of London, who also own the whole of Hampstead Heath. The lido is open for the Summer Season from mid May to mid September. From September to April it is open from 7am to 12 noon for Early Morning swims only, one of only three unheated Winter Swimming venues in London, the others being Brockwell Lido in Herne Hill and Tooting Bec Lido. Another swimming venue, the Highgate Ponds are a short walk away. There is a users' group for the lido (and the ponds), the United Swimmers' Association of Hampstead Heath. History Lido frontage in 2007 The lido was opened on 20 August 1938. The lido was designed by Harry Rowbotham and TL Smithson (London County Council Parks Department) and is nearly identical in design to Victoria Park Lido and Brockwell Park Lido. There was a diving stage, shutes and a caf√©, with areas for sunbathing and spectators. Costing ¬£34,000 to construct, this was the most expensive of London County Council's 13 lidos built in the 1920‚Äì39 period. In 1976, after the death of a 15-year-old boy, further safety measures were taken, including removing most of the diving facilities and increasing staff. The last diving board was removed in 2003. Refurbishments after the late 1980s included hot showers, cycle racks, paddling pool and CCTV. In 1986 the lido was taken over by the London Residuary Body and in 1989 by the Corporation of London. The lido was Grade II Listed in January 1999. 49,000 visitors were recorded in 2003. In 2005, the custom for free swimming before 9.30am was dropped and a ¬£2 entry fee introduced.

Unlike welding, soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In brazing, the work piece metal also does not melt, but the filler metal is one that melts at a higher temperature than in soldering. In the past, nearly all solders contained lead, but environmental and health concerns have increasingly dictated use of lead-free alloys for electronics and plumbing purposes.  Origins  Small figurine being created by soldering There is evidence that soldering was employed as early as 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. Soldering and brazing are thought to have originated very early in the history of metal-working, probably before 4000 BC. Sumerian swords from were assembled using hard soldering. Soldering was historically used to make jewelry items, cooking ware and tools, as well as other uses such as in assembling stained glass.  Applications  Soldering is used in plumbing, electronics, and metalwork from flashing to jewellery and musical instruments. Soldering provides reasonably permanent but reversible connections between copper pipes in plumbing systems as well as joints in sheet metal objects such as food cans, roof flashing, rain gutters and automobile radiators. Jewelry components, machine tools and some refrigeration and plumbing components are often assembled and repaired by the higher temperature silver soldering process. Small mechanical parts are often soldered or brazed as well. Soldering is also used to join lead came and copper foil in stained glass work. Electronic soldering connects electrical wiring to devices, and electronic components to printed circuit boards. Electronic connections may be hand-soldered with a soldering iron. Automated methods such as wave soldering or use of ovens can make many joints on a complex circuit board in one operation, vastly reducing production cost of electronic devices. Musical instruments, especially brass and woodwind instruments, use a combination of soldering and brazing in their assembly. Brass bodies are often soldered together, while keywork and braces are most often brazed.  Solders  Soldering filler materials are available in many different alloys for differing applications. In electronics assembly, the eutectic alloy with 63% tin and 37% lead (or 60/40, which is almost identical in melting point) has been the alloy of choice. Other alloys are used for plumbing, mechanical assembly, and other applications. Some examples of soft-solder are tin-lead for general purposes, tin-zinc for joining aluminium, lead-silver for strength at higher than room temperature, cadmium-silver for strength at high temperatures, zinc-aluminium for aluminium and corrosion resistance, and tin- silver and tin-bismuth for electronics. A eutectic formulation has advantages when applied to soldering: the liquidus and solidus temperatures are the same, so there is no plastic phase, and it has the lowest possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat stress on electronic components during soldering. And, having no plastic phase allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the solder cools. A non- eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures. Any movement during the plastic phase may result in cracks, resulting in an unreliable joint. Common solder formulations based on tin and lead are listed below. The fraction represent percentage of tin first, then lead, totaling 100%: * 63/37: melts at (eutectic: the only mixture that melts at a point, instead of over a range) * 60/40: melts between * 50/50: melts between For environmental reasons (and the introduction of regulations such as the European RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive), lead-free solders are becoming more widely used. They are also suggested anywhere young children may come into contact with (since young children are likely to place things into their mouths), or for outdoor use where rain and other precipitation may wash the lead into the groundwater. Unfortunately, most lead-free solders are not eutectic formulations, melting at around , making it more difficult to create reliable joints with them. Other common solders include low-temperature formulations (often containing bismuth), which are often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without unsoldering earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing silver) which are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics, and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, silver solders have the greatest strength and the broadest applications. Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, the ability to solder aluminum, better electrical conductivity, and higher corrosion resistance. Flux The purpose of flux is to facilitate the soldering process. One of the obstacles to a successful solder joint is an impurity at the site of the joint, for example, dirt, oil or oxidation. The impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (the solder) encourages the work piece (and the solder) to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as the soldering temperatures increase and can completely prevent the solder from joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux was charcoal, which acts as a reducing agent and helps prevent oxidation during the soldering process. Some fluxes go beyond the simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning (corrosion). Many fluxes also act as a wetting agent in the soldering process, reducing the surface tension of the molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily. For many years, the most common type of flux used in electronics (soft soldering) was rosin-based, using the rosin from selected pine trees. It was nearly ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non- conductive at normal temperatures but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at elevated soldering temperatures. Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based (hydrochloric acid) flux which provides rather aggressive cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used in electronics because their residues are conductive leading to unintended electrical connections, and because they will eventually dissolve small diameter wires. Citric acid is an excellent water-soluble acid-type flux for copper and electronics but must be washed off afterwards. Fluxes for soft solder are currently available in three basic formulations: * Water-soluble fluxes ‚Äì higher activity fluxes which can be removed with water after soldering (no VOCs required for removal). * No-clean fluxes ‚Äì mild enough to not \\"require\\" removal due to their non-conductive and non-corrosive residues. These fluxes are called \\"no-clean\\" because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird- droppings. No-clean flux residue is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. Connector mating surfaces must also be free of flux residue. Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defectIPC-A-610 revision E section 10.6.4 * Traditional rosin fluxes ‚Äì available in non-activated (R), mildly activated (RMA) and activated (RA) formulations. RA and RMA fluxes contain rosin combined with an activating agent, typically an acid, which increases the wettability of metals to which it is applied by removing existing oxides. The residue resulting from the use of RA flux is corrosive and must be cleaned. RMA flux is formulated to result in a residue which is less corrosive, so that cleaning becomes optional, though usually preferred. R flux is still less active and even less corrosive. Flux performance must be carefully evaluated for best results; a very mild 'no-clean' flux might be perfectly acceptable for production equipment, but not give adequate performance for more variable hand-soldering operations. Processes Brazing and soldering processes classification chartAWS A3.0:2001, Standard Welding Terms and Definitions Including Terms for Adhesive Bonding, Brazing, Soldering, Thermal Cutting, and Thermal Spraying, American Welding Society (2001), p. 118. There are three forms of soldering, each requiring progressively higher temperatures and producing an increasingly stronger joint strength: # soft soldering, which originally used a tin-lead alloy as the filler metal # silver soldering, which uses an alloy containing silver # brazing which uses a brass alloy for the filler The alloy of the filler metal for each type of soldering can be adjusted to modify the melting temperature of the filler. Soldering differs from gluing significantly in that the filler metals directly bond with the surfaces of the workpieces at the junction to form an electrically conductive gas- and liquid-tight bond. Soft soldering is characterized by having a melting point of the filler metal below approximately , whereas silver soldering and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing lead) that have liquidus temperatures below . In this soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in a surface alloying process called wetting. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire between the strands by capillary action in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's tensile strength is dependent on the filler metal used; in electrical soldering little tensile strength comes from the added solder which is why it is advised that wires be twisted or folded together before soldering to provide some mechanical strength for a joint. A good solder joint produces an electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight join. Each type of solder offers advantages and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called because of the soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but does not make a strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc. Soldering operations can be performed with hand tools, one joint at a time, or en masse on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a soldering iron, soldering gun, or a torch, or occasionally a hot-air pencil. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with \\"soldering coppers\\" directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in the mass of the soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (e.g. butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled. Each solder alloy has characteristics that work best for certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term silver solder denotes the type of solder that is used. Some soft solders are \\"silver-bearing\\" alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders should not be used on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it. =Soldering and brazing= The distinction between soldering and brazing is based on the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450 ¬∞C is usually used as a practical demarcation between soldering and brazing. Soft soldering can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods typically require a higher temperature torch or a furnace to melt the filler metal. Different equipment is usually required since a soldering iron cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation). Since the joint is produced using a metal with a lower melting temperature than the workpiece, the joint will weaken as the ambient temperature approaches the melting point of the filler metal. For that reason, the higher temperature processes produce joints which are effective at higher temperatures. Brazed connections can be as strong or nearly as strong as the parts they connect, even at elevated temperatures.Properties of gold-nickel alloy brazed joints in high temperature materials, in Gold Bulletin, June 1974, Volume 7, Issue 2, pp 42‚Äì49; by Jakob Colbus and Karl Friedrich Zimmermann; https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03215037 =Silver soldering= \\"Hard soldering\\" or \\"silver soldering\\" is used to join precious and semi-precious metals such as gold, silver, brass, and copper. The solder is usually described as easy, medium, or hard in reference to its melting temperature, not the strength of the joint. Extra-easy solder contains 56% silver and has a melting point of . Extra-hard solder has 80% silver and melts at . If multiple joints are needed, then the jeweler will start with hard or extra-hard solder and switch to lower-temperature solders for later joints. Silver solder is somewhat absorbed by the surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be perfectly flush, as silver solder cannot normally be used as a filler and will not fill gaps. Another difference between brazing and soldering is how the solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it melts. When silver solder melts, it tends to flow towards the area of greatest heat. Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with a torch; it will even sometimes run straight up along a seam. =Induction soldering= Induction soldering uses induction heating by high- frequency alternating current in a surrounding copper coil. This induces currents in the part being soldered, which generates heat because of the higher resistance of a joint versus its surrounding metal (resistive heating). These copper coils can be shaped to fit the joint more precisely. A filler metal (solder) is placed between the facing surfaces, and this solder melts at a fairly low temperature. Fluxes are commonly used in induction soldering. This technique is particularly suited to continuously soldering, in which case these coils wrap around a cylinder or a pipe that needs to be soldered. Some metals are easier to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy. Iron, mild steel and nickel are next in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, stainless steel and some aluminium alloys are even more difficult to solder. Titanium, magnesium, cast irons, some high-carbon steels, ceramics, and graphite can be soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding. =Electronic components (PCBs)= Desoldering of an SMD capacitor A tube of multicore electronics solder used for manual soldering An improperly soldered 'cold' joint, the wire was not sufficiently heated Broken solder joints on a circuit board, the joint on the right, although unbroken, has separated from the board Currently, mass-production printed circuit boards (PCBs) are mostly wave soldered or reflow soldered, though hand soldering of production electronics is also still widely used. In wave soldering, components are prepped (trimmed or modified) and installed on the PCB. Sometimes, to prevent movement they are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive or secured with a fixture, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container. This solder flow is forced to produce a standing wave so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but rather just touched. The end result is that solder stays on pins and pads, but not on the PCB itself. Reflow soldering is a process in which a solder paste (a mixture of prealloyed solder powder and a flux-vehicle that has a peanut butter-like consistency) is used to stick the components to their attachment pads, after which the assembly is heated by an infrared lamp, a hot air pencil, or, more commonly, by passing it through a carefully controlled oven. Since different components can be best assembled by different techniques, it is common to use two or more processes for a given PCB. For example, surface mounted parts may be reflow soldered first, with a wave soldering process for the through-hole mounted components coming next, and bulkier parts hand- soldered last. Hand soldering For hand soldering, the heat source tool is selected to provide adequate heat for the size of joint to be completed. A 100-watt soldering iron may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25-watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause heat damage, perhaps even detaching PCB traces from the substrate. Hand- soldering techniques require a great deal of skill for the fine-pitch soldering of surface mount chip packages. In particular ball grid array (BGA) devices are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to rework by hand. For attachment of electronic components to a PCB, proper selection and use of flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering; it is essential for good wetting and heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses. A heat sink may be used on the leads of heat sensitive components to reduce heat transfer to the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. The heat sink will mean the use of more heat to complete the joint, since heat taken up by the heat sink will not heat the work pieces. If all metal surfaces have not been properly cleaned (\\"fluxed\\") or brought entirely above the melting temperature of the solder used, the result will be an unreliable (\\"cold solder\\") joint, even though its appearance may suggest otherwise. To simplify soldering, beginners are usually advised to apply the soldering iron and the solder separately to the joint, rather than the solder being applied directly to the iron. When sufficient solder is applied, the solder wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the solder will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then removed from the joint. Soldering defects Since non-eutectic solder alloys have a small plastic range, the joint must not be moved until the solder has cooled down through both the liquidus and solidus temperatures. When visually inspected, a good solder joint will appear smooth and shiny, with the outline of the soldered wire clearly visible. A matte gray surface is a good indicator of a joint that was moved during soldering. The boundary between the solder and the workpiece in a good joint will have a low angle. Other solder defects can be detected visually as well. Cold solder joints are dull and sometimes cracked or pock-marked. Too little solder will result in a \\"dry\\" and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With some fluxes, flux residue remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts involved. Excess solder and unconsumed flux and residue is sometimes wiped from the soldering iron tip between joints. The tip of the bit (commonly iron plated to reduce erosion) is kept wetted with solder (\\"tinned\\") when hot to assist soldering, and to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip itself. Hot-bar reflow Hot-bar reflow is a selective soldering process where two pre- fluxed, solder coated parts are heated with heating element (called a thermode) to a sufficient temperature to melt the solder. Pressure is applied through the whole process (usually 15 seconds) to ensure that components stay in place during cooling. The heating element is heated and cooled for each connection. Up to 4000 W can be used in the heating element allowing fast soldering, good results with connections requiring high energy. Laser Laser soldering is a technique where a 30‚Äì50 W laser is used to melt and solder an electrical connection joint. Diode laser systems based on semiconductor junctions are used for this purpose. 0204 www.coherent.com Suzanne Jenniches patented laser soldering in 1980. Wavelengths are typically 808 nm through 980 nm. The beam is delivered via an optical fiber to the workpiece, with fiber diameters 800 ¬µm and smaller. Since the beam out of the end of the fiber diverges rapidly, lenses are used to create a suitable spot size on the workpiece at a suitable working distance. A wire feeder is used to supply solder. 070927 ma-info.de Both lead-tin and silver-tin material can be soldered. Process recipes will differ depending on the alloy composition. For soldering 44-pin chip carriers to a board using soldering preforms, power levels were on the order of 10 watts and solder times approximately 1 second. Low power levels can lead to incomplete wetting and the formation of voids, both of which can weaken the joint. Environmental regulation and RoHS Environmental legislation in many countries, and the whole of the European Community area (see RoHS), has led to a change in formulation of both solders and fluxes. Water-soluble non-rosin-based fluxes have been increasingly used since the 1980s so that soldered boards can be cleaned with water or water- based cleaners. This eliminates hazardous solvents from the production environment, and from factory effluents. Those regulations have also reduced the use of lead based solders, and caused the melting temperatures of solders in use to increase by up to . =Fiber focus infrared soldering= Fiber focus infrared soldering is technique where many infrared sources are led through fibers, then focused onto a single spot at which the connection is soldered. 070927 vincenc.com.tw (mentioned as a technique) =Pipe soldering= Soldered copper pipes Solder Lead-free solder Copper pipe, or 'tube', is commonly joined by soldering. When applied in a plumbing trade context in the United States, soldering is often referred to as sweating, and a tubing connection so made is referred to as a sweated joint. Copper tubing conducts heat away much faster than a conventional hand-held soldering iron or gun can provide, so a propane torch is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a MAPP-fueled, acetylene-fueled, or propylene-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature is much higher than the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard- tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable swirl tips is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled tradesman, the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering. However, it is possible to use an electrical tool to solder joints in copper pipe sized from . For example, the Antex Pipemaster is recommended for use in tight spaces, when open flames are hazardous, or by do-it-yourself users. The pliers-like tool uses heated fitted jaws that completely encircle the pipe, allowing a joint to be melted in as little as 10 seconds. Solder fittings, also known as capillary fittings, are usually used for copper joints. These fittings are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over the outside of the mating tube. Commonly used fittings include for straight connectors, reducers, bends, and tees. There are two types of solder fittings: end feed fittings which contain no solder, and solder ring fittings (also known as Yorkshire fittings), in which there is a ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting. As with all solder joints, all parts to be joined must be clean and oxide free. Internal and external wire brushes are available for the common pipe and fitting sizes; emery cloth and wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint. Because of the size of the parts involved, and the high activity and contaminating tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically active, and often more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because plumbing joints may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux is applied to all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues are removed after the joint is complete to prevent erosion and failure of the joint. Many plumbing solder formulations are available, with different characteristics, such as higher or lower melting temperature, depending on the specific requirements of the job. Building codes currently almost universally require the use of lead-free solder for potable water piping, though traditional tin-lead solder is still available. Studies have shown that lead- soldered plumbing pipes can result in elevated levels of lead in drinking water. Since copper pipe quickly conducts heat away from a joint, great care must be taken to ensure that the joint is properly heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible around the edge of the fitting and allowed to cool. Of the three methods of connecting copper tubing, solder connections require the most skill, but soldering copper is a very reliable process, provided some basic conditions are met: * The tubing and fittings must be cleaned to bare metal with no tarnish * Any pressure which is formed by heating of the tubing must have an outlet * The joint must be dry (which can be challenging when repairing water pipes) Copper is only one material that is joined in this manner. Brass fittings are often used for valves or as a connection fitting between copper and other metals. Brass piping is soldered in this manner in the making of brass instruments and some woodwind (saxophone and flute) musical instruments =Mechanical and aluminium soldering= A number of solder materials, primarily zinc alloys, are used for soldering aluminium metal and alloys and to a lesser extent steel and zinc. This mechanical soldering is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be used for structural repairs of those materials. The American Welding Society defines brazing as using filler metals with melting points over ‚Äî or, by the traditional definition in the United States, above . Aluminium soldering alloys generally have melting temperatures around .Alumaloy , accessed 2009-04-03 This soldering / brazing operation can use a propane torch heat source.Alumiweld FAQ , accessed 2009-04-03 These materials are often advertised as \\"aluminium welding\\", but the process does not involve melting the base metal, and therefore is not properly a weld. United States Military Standard or MIL-SPEC specification MIL-R-4208 defines one standard for these zinc-based brazing/soldering alloys.MIL-R-4208 , accessed 2009-04-03 A number of products meet this specification.Aladdin 3-in-1 , accessed 2009-04-03HTS-2000 , accessed 2009-03-09 or very similar performance standards. =Resistance soldering= Resistance soldering is soldering in which the heat required to flow the solder is created by passing an electric current through the solder. When current is conducted through a resistive material a certain level of heat is generated. By regulating the amount of current conducted and the level of resistance encountered, the amount of heat produced can be predetermined and controlled. Electrical resistance (usually described as a material's opposition to the flow of an electric current) is used to convert electric energy into thermal energy as an electric current (I) conducted through a material with resistance (R) releases power (P) equal to P = I'R, where P is the power measured in watts, I is the current measured in amperes and R is the resistance measured in ohms. Resistance soldering is unlike using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then passed through a thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, can be used for difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area. =Stained glass soldering= Historically, stained glass soldering tips were copper, heated by being placed in a charcoal-burning brazier. Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used. More recently, electrically heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside the tip of the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work. Oleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability. Tiffany- type stained glass is made by gluing copper foil around the edges of the pieces of glass and then soldering them together. This method makes it possible to create three-dimensional stained glass pieces. =Active soldering= Flux-less soldering with aid of conventional soldering iron, ultrasonic soldering iron or specialized solder pot and active solder that contains an active element, most often titanium, zirconium or chromium. The active elements, owing to mechanical activation, react with the surface of the materials generally considered difficult to solder without premetallization. The active solders can be protected against excessive oxidation of their active element by addition of rare earth elements with higher affinity to oxygen (typically cerium or lanthanum). Another common additive is gallium ‚Äì usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of stainless wire brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20‚Äì60 kHz). Active soldering has been shown to effectively bond ceramics, aluminium, titanium, silicon, graphite and carbon nanotube based structures at temperatures lower than 450 ¬∞C or use of protective atmosphere. Solderability The solderability of a substrate is a measure of the ease with which a soldered joint can be made to that material. Desoldering and resoldering Used solder contains some of the dissolved base metals and is unsuitable for reuse in making new joints. Once the solder's capacity for the base metal has been achieved it will no longer properly bond with the base metal, usually resulting in a brittle cold solder joint with a crystalline appearance. It is good practice to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering‚Äîdesoldering braids or vacuum desoldering equipment (solder suckers) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered. The lower melting point of solder means it can be melted away from the base metal, leaving it mostly intact, though the outer layer will be \\"tinned\\" with solder. Flux will remain which can easily be removed by abrasive or chemical processes. This tinned layer will allow solder to flow into a new joint, resulting in a new joint, as well as making the new solder flow very quickly and easily.  Lead-free electronic soldering  More recently environmental legislation has specifically targeted the wide use of lead in the electronics industry. The RoHS directives in Europe required many new electronic circuit boards to be lead-free by 1 July 2006, mostly in the consumer goods industry, but in some others as well. In Japan lead was phased out prior to legislation by manufacturers due to the additional expense in recycling products containing lead.FACT AND FICTION IN LEAD FREE SOLDERING from www.dkmetals.co.uk However, even without the presence of lead, soldering can release fumes that are harmful and/or toxic to humans. It is highly recommended to use a device that can remove the fumes from the work area either by ventilating outside or filtering the air. Lead free soldering requires higher soldering temperatures than lead/tin soldering. SnPb 63/37 Eutectic solder melts at . SAC lead free solder melts at . Nevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder baths etc. Lead-free construction has also extended to components, pins, and connectors. Most of these pins used copper frames, and either lead, tin, gold or other finishes. Tin finishes are the most popular of lead-free finishes. Nevertheless, this brings up the issue of how to deal with tin whiskers. The current movement brings the electronics industry back to the problems solved in the 1960s by adding lead. JEDEC has created a classification system to help lead-free electronic manufacturers decide what provisions to take against whiskers, depending upon their application. Soldering defects In the joining of copper tube, failure to properly heat and fill a joint may lead to a 'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the back of the fitting cup, and the solder wire applied degrees opposite the flame, then solder will quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint. This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space. =Electronics= Various problems may arise in the soldering process which lead to joints which are nonfunctional either immediately or after a period of use. The most common defect when hand-soldering results from the parts being joined not exceeding the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a \\"cold solder\\" joint. This is usually the result of the soldering iron being used to heat the solder directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder, guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic hand soldering the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore, heating the solder first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being soldered. A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation. A \\"dry joint\\" occurs when the cooling solder is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when the soldering iron is removed from the joint. An improperly selected or applied flux can cause joint failure. If not properly cleaned, a flux may corrode the joint and cause eventual joint failure. Without flux the joint may not be clean, or may be oxidized, resulting in an unsound joint. In electronics non- corrosive fluxes are often used. Therefore, cleaning flux off may merely be a matter of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices, military and aerospace. For satellites, this will also reduce weight, slightly but usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of protective material such as a lacquer to protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment. Movement of metals being soldered before the solder has cooled will cause a highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology this is known as a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry joint is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically. In general a good-looking soldered joint is a good joint. A good joint will be smooth, bright, and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, lead-free solder formulations may cool to a dull surface even if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes over as it solidifies even though it has not been disturbed during cooling. In electronics a 'concave' fillet is ideal. This indicates good wetting and minimal use of solder (therefore minimal heating of heat sensitive components). A joint may be good, but if a large amount of unnecessary solder is used then more heating is obviously required. Excessive heating of a PCB may result in 'delamination' - the copper track may actually lift off the board, particularly on single sided PCBs without through hole plating. Tools In principle any type of soldering tool can carry out any work using solder at temperatures it can generate. In practice different tools are more suitable for different applications. Hand-soldering tools widely used for electronics work include the electric soldering iron, which can be fitted with a variety of tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The soldering gun heats faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air guns and pencils allow rework of component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and guns. For non-electronic applications soldering torches use a flame rather than a soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy- fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, can be used for soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame. A soldering copper is a tool with a large copper head and a long handle which is heated in a blacksmith's forge fire and used to apply heat to sheet metal for soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds. The head provides a large thermal mass to store enough heat for soldering large areas before needing re-heating in the fire; the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although body solder has been mostly superseded by spot welding for mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring. Toaster ovens and hand held infrared lights have been used by hobbyists to replicate production soldering processes on a much smaller scale. Bristle brushes are usually used to apply plumbing paste flux. For electronic work, flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux may be used from a flux pen or dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle. Wire brush, wire wool and emery cloth are commonly used to prepare plumbing joints for connection. Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new prototyping board that has been on the shelf for about a year or more, may need to be mechanically cleaned. Some fluxes for electronics are designed to be stable and inactive when cool and do not need to be cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used. A heat sink, such as a crocodile clip, can be used to prevent damaging heat-sensitive components while hand- soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the component body remains cooler. When soldering pipes closely connected to valves such as in refrigeration systems it may be necessary to protect the valve from heat that could damage rubber or plastic components within, in this case a wet cloth wrapped around the valve can often sink sufficient heat through the boiling of the water to protect the valve. During WW2 and for some time afterwards SOE forces used small pyrotechnic self- soldering joints to make connections for the remote detonation of demolition and sabotage explosives. These consisted of a small copper tube partially filled with solder and a slow-burning pyrotechnic composition wrapped around the tube. The wires to be joined would be inserted into the tube and a small blob of ignition compound allowed the device to be struck like a match to ignite the pyrotechnic and heat the tube for long enough to melt the solder and make the joint.

An electrical engineer, Allum founded Allum Electrical in Auckland in 1922. Political career He was on the Auckland City Council from 1920 to 1929, and from 1938 to 1941 as deputy mayor. He was on other local bodies (Transport Board, Drainage Board, Harbour Bridge Authority etc.) and associations, e.g. the New Zealand Employers Federation of which he was twice president and cultural organisations for ballet and opera. He was mayor of Auckland from 1941. As chair of the Drainage Board, he was vehemently opposed by Dove-Myer Robinson over a sewerage scheme on Browns Island. He lost the 1953 mayoral election and was the first incumbent in Auckland that century who unsuccessfully stood for re-election. Allum is known as the person who championed the Auckland Harbour Bridge, sometimes referred to as Jack Allum's Bridge. He became the inaugural chairman of the Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority in 1950 and only relinquished this role in 1971 at the age of 82. He contested the in the electorate for the Reform Party. That year, there was a coalition between the Reform and United Parties, and both Allum and Hugh Ross Mackenzie for United claimed to be the official coalition candidate. In the end, Mackenzie was the official candidate, and Allum came third, with the electorate being won by the Prime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage. Honours In 1935, Allum was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for patriotic and social welfare services in the 1946 New Year Honours, and a Knight Bachelor in the 1950 King's Birthday Honours.

Situated in the extreme east of Sikkim, Rhenock witnessed the establishment of the first police outpost in the state, which is the historical event. History Rhenock was covered with dense forest in and around the 13th century. The Lepchas were the early settlers about five or six hundred years ago. Middle of 16th century the Bhutias, migrated from Tibet settled in the villages presently known as Kyongsa, Aritar, Tarpin, Reshi and Chalisey. The people who settled were Gorkha ethnic groups such as Newars, Bahuns (Adhikari, Poudyal, Gautam, Dahal, Bhandari, Pokhrel and Achaarja), Chhetri (Subedi, Khatiwada & Bista), Gurung, Rai and Limboo. Some people from Northern parts of India also migrated here at around 1940-1960 for business. People Rhenock is inhabited by people of different ethnic groups such as Lepchas, Bhutias, Nepalis (Gorkhas), Biharis and Marwaris. Lepcha tribes who were early settlers have their own unique culture. Originally followers of Shamanism, they later became followers of Buddhism. Some of them are followers of Christianity. Bhutias are another group of tribes who are followers of Buddhism and who have their own identity and culture. The majority of the people are Indian Nepalis also known as Gorkha. Most of them are Hindus by religion. Some of the Nepalis Gurung after 1990 became Buddhist; before that they were followers of Hinduism. Some others are followers of Christianity. In spite of the above, everyone respects others' beliefs and faiths and celebrates others' festivals which makes a peaceful and prosperous society. Educational institutions Rhenock has about 130 years of history of education. Rhenock School is among the oldest schools of Sikkim.

At the end of each season, the Champions played a combined team from the ‚ÄúRest of the League‚Äù. Lyme Regis also had a team, although they didn't play in the league. One of these teams, Bridport Swimming Club was formed in 1898 following a meeting at the town hall. An area of the harbour at West Bay was named the ‚ÄúPolo Basin‚Äù to play in, and a referee‚Äôs stand was built on the piles, with a goal tied to the outside of one of the piers for practice. An annual club ‚Äúregatta‚Äù was held in the summer, which lasted until the late 20th Century, of which the water polo match in front of huge crowds was reported as being the prime event, following the swimming gala. Other than the league matches, various friendly games were played, against teams such as ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company VBDE, Captain v Vice Captains teams, and Residents v Visitors. In 1910 two thousand spectators turned up to watch the town team play Frome, and TV footage from the 1920s/1930s shows Bridport, having moved their pitch from the ‚ÄòPolo Basin‚Äô in the harbour to the river, playing in front of huge crowds of around 1500. A spectator stand was built with regular matches played against local and touring teams there until the late 1980s. =Dorset Water Polo League= We can only assume that water polo continued to flourish when the soldiers returned from the First World War because when the Dorset County Amateur Swimming Association was formed in 1931 it paid for a senior men's championship shield which is still competed for today. The first winners on this trophy were Bridport, the only time the town lifted the championship. After the Second World War, Portland became the supreme force in Dorset water polo winning the championship shield 21 years on the trot. Weymouth also had a strong water polo side during this time and there was a great deal of local rivalry. It was also a time when water polo was the main event and the crowd was attracted to the game more than the swimming gala, which often preceded it. Weymouth went on to win in 1971 and 1972. Bridport, another leading club at the time, ran three teams and had regular visits from clubs like the mighty Cheltenham and Weston-super-Mare and touring London sides. During the summer, the team was cheered on by hundreds of holiday makers and locals alike with a match collection making the club very wealthy. Sometimes, Dorset's water polo players had more than their opponents to contend with. During one match at West Bay, a dead sheep floated into the playing area and on another occasion a dog decided to jump in and become one of the players. The Dorset League was at the time a flourishing annual competition with teams from Bridport, Portland, Weymouth, Wareham, Lyme Regis and Swanage taking part. The sport continued to flourish through the post-war period. By the beginning of the 1970s, new indoor pools were being built in most major towns in the county and indeed all over the country. Ironically, this contributed to the decline of water polo as the river and the sea was no longer so attractive to play in. It meant also that for those clubs that still played the game in swimming pools, their playing time was often relegated to less sociable hours with games and practices often ending at 10pm. =The Lean Period - 1980s & 1990s= All through the 1980s and 1990s, Bournemouth continued to play in the Hampshire League and still does today. However, from around 1972, the Weymouth and Portland clubs only played the odd game and some players went off to play for Yeovil just over the Somerset border. Bridport continued to play in the River Brit until the late 1980s when flood alleviation work was undertaken. However, in the mid 1990s there were the ‚Äúgreen shoots‚Äù of revival, as the Wessex Water Polo Club reformed in 1983 started to play in the Wiltshire league and then in the Bristol & West league, winning promotion to Division One in the 1994/95 season. The club reformed in 2001 becoming Weymouth & Portland playing in the Hampshire league and becoming either winners or runners-up many times. Bridport formed a new team at their new swimming pool in 1994, playing friendly matches. =The Revival - 2000s= In 2004 a group consisting of existing clubs and new clubs around the county got together to form a new Dorset Water Polo League. In addition to Senior Mens Water Polo, the league added a large mixed Junior element as well as a Senior Ladies competition. The sport has continued to grow and teams are now competing outside the county. Competitions =Dorset Water Polo League= The Dorset Water Polo League runs from October to June and leagues currently run for the following categories:- * Key Stage 2 * Key Stage 3 * Juniors * Senior Men * Senior Ladies =Dorset Water Polo Senior Mens Championship Shield= A trophy first competed for in 1931. The current holders are Bournemouth Swimming Club. Dorset County Team The county operates a development day once a term basis at St Mary's School, Shaftesbury for players looking to develop their skills. Top level coaches are often brought in to give players a level of training above their clubs. County teams play at ASA South West Regional Championships on an annual basis in the following categories:- * 18 & Under Boys * 16 & Under Girls * 14 & Under Mixed In addition, Dorset resurrected a traditional fixture against Devon in 2008, with Senior Mens, Senior Ladies & Junior Boys competing.

This behavior is a part of the dog's training and is central to a service animal's success on the job. The concept of intelligent disobedience has been in use and a common part of service animals' training since at least 1936. Examples When a blind person wishes to cross a street and issues an instruction to the assistance dog to do so, the dog should refuse to move when such an action would put the person in harm's way. The animal understands that this contradicts the learned behavior to respond to the owner's instructions: instead it makes an alternative decision because the human is not in a position to decide safely. The dog in this case has the capacity to understand that it is performing such an action for the welfare of the person. In another example, a blind person must communicate with the animal in such a way that the animal can recognize that the person is aware of the surroundings and can safely proceed. If a blind person wishes to descend a staircase, an animal properly trained to exhibit intelligent disobedience will refuse to move unless the person issues a specific code word or command that lets the animal know the person is aware they are about to descend stairs. This command will be specific for staircases, and the animal will not attribute it to stepping off a curb or up onto a sidewalk or stoop. In a similar circumstance, if the person believes they are in front of a step and they wish to go down, but they are in fact standing in front of a dangerous precipice (for example, a loading dock or cliff), the animal will refuse to proceed. Application to other fields Ira Chaleff suggests in his 2015 book Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You're Told to Do is Wrong Ira Chaleff (2015) Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You're Told to Do Is Wrong that intelligent disobedience has a place in other important areas. One notable example is crew resource management, or CRM, where the flight crew of an aircraft is encouraged to bring anything that seems questionable about an order, or additional information, to the captain's attention, usually respectfully and tactfully, but if it is urgent enough, more strongly, just as the guide dogs do. He opens the book by mentioning how the idea came to him when he had a person who was training a guide dog in one of his classes. Besides CRM, the principle is applicable in almost every other field, such as medicine, engineering, and business. Intelligent Disobedience has also found its place in Children's Rights Education offering instruments that help to keep children safe from the traumatic instances when authority figures abuse their power. One of these tools is the mnemonic Blink! Think! Choice! Voice!Ira Chaleff (2018) Intelligent Disobedience for Children: A Handbook for Parents and other Caregivers that works similar to the simple fire safety technique stop, drop and roll taught to children in most English-speaking countries.

Potter was born in 1718, the second son of John Potter, Archbishop of Canterbury. He matriculated, aged 13, at Christ Church, Oxford in 1731, graduating B.A. in 1735, and was admitted to the Middle Temple. Through his father's interest, he was able to secure the Recordership of Bath, a lucrative office. Potter married firstly Anne Manningham, daughter of Rev. Thomas Manningham, rector of Slinfold, Sussex on 17 February 1740. Anne died on 4 January 1744 and he married secondly a Miss Lowe of Brightwell, Oxfordshire on 14 July 1747. From his second marriage he acquired Segenhoe Manor at Ridgmont, near Woburn, Bedfordshire. Potter was a recognised member of the Hellfire Club, in Buckinghamshire, founded by Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer and acquired a reputation as a leading rake. Potter was a friend of John Wilkes, whom he considered as something of a prot√©g√©. He was later accused of corrupting Wilkes who had been relatively innocent until that point.Cash p.29-36 He was believed to be the author of Essay on Woman, a crude parody of Alexander Pope's Essay on Man. The authorship of this was later attributed to John Wilkes, when it was read out in the House of Lords, during his expulsion from parliament in 1764. In 1747 Potter was elected as Member of Parliament for St Germans in Cornwall. In 1754 he was elected as MP for Aylesbury, a seat controlled by the powerful Grenville family with whom he was associated from then on. In 1756 he became a Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, another lucrative post, which did not require him to move to Ireland.Cash p.44 He was returned as MP for Okehampton in 1757. Politically he was aligned with William Pitt and was his devoted follower. He was a staunch supporter of Britain's participation in the Seven Years War. He tried to interest his son Thomas in finding a seat in Parliament.

The Court held that the 2006 amendments were inconsistent with the system of representative democracy established by the Constitution. Voting in elections lies at the heart of that system of representative government, and disenfranchisement of a group of adult citizens without a substantial reason would not be consistent with it. The three-year criterion in the 2004 amendments was held to be valid as it sufficiently distinguished between serious lawlessness and less serious but still reprehensible conduct.  Background  Vicki Lee Roach was a Victorian woman of Aboriginal descent, who was serving a six-year term of imprisonment at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Deer Park. In 2002, Roach and her then partner robbed a milk bar. She was driving the getaway car, being pursued by police, when she struck a car stopped at a traffic light, causing extensive injuries to the 21-year-old driver. Roach had alcohol, tranquilisers, morphine, and a cannabis-related substance in her blood and was subsequently convicted on five counts for offences of burglary, theft, conduct endangering persons, and negligently causing serious injury. On each count, she received a sentence of between 12 months and 3 years, with a total effective sentence of six years and a non- parole period of 4 years.Roach v Electoral Commissioner (2007) CLR 162 at p. 183. Roach was represented by Ron Merkel , a former judge of the Federal Court of Australia, and assisted by the Human Rights Law Centre. The arguments included that indigenous Australians were disproportionately disqualified from voting, as indigenous Australians are only 2.5% of the population, but constitute more than a quarter of the national prison population.Roach v Electoral Commissioner (2007) CLR 162 at p. 164.  Decision  Chief Justice Murray Gleeson held that the right to vote was constitutionally protected. Universal suffrage was long established; anything less was not a choice by the people as required by sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution. Removing the right to vote for serious misconduct was acceptable (hence the previous legislation was valid); however, imprisonment failed as a method of identifying serious criminal misconduct when looking at short-term sentences. These sentences tended to be imposed for arbitrary reasons, such as location or homelessness, that were unrelated to the seriousness of the offence. Justices William Gummow, Michael Kirby, and Susan Crennan decided the validity of the legislation by applying an \\"appropriate and adapted\\" test similar to the second limb of the Lange test respecting freedom of political communication. The arbitrary reasons for imposing, or not imposing, short terms of imprisonment mentioned by Gleeson were used to support this conclusion.. The Court published its orders on 30 August 2007,. to ensure people could be enrolled to vote in the 2007 election, and published its reasons on 26 September 2007. In other words, Roach had won the case and prisoners were allowed to vote in elections but only if they have a sentence below a certain amount of time. Even though Roach won the case she was still not able to vote due to the length of her sentence.

The district, part of Saran Division, is also known as Chhapra district after the headquarters of the district, Chhapra.  Typonym  It is said that \\"Saran\\" is a corrupted version of the word Sarangaranya (forest of Deers). According to legends, earlier it was a dense forest full of Deers and home of Rishi Sarangi. Another suggestion is that the name is corruption of Sakra-aranya (the forest of Indra). History Chirand, 10 kilometres east of Chhapra, is a stratified Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Iron Age settlement, which is known for its continuous archaeological record from the Neolithic age (about 2500‚Äì1345 BC) to the reign of the Pal dynasty who ruled during the pre- medieval period. The archaeological records suggest transitions in human habitation patterns in Chirand dating from 2500 BC to 30 AD. Hathwa Raj was a zamindar in the Saran Division of Bihar belonging to Bhumihars, which encompassed 1,365 villages, was inhabited by more than 391,000 people, and produced an annual rental of almost a million rupees.

The district of Saran is situated between 25¬∞36' and 26¬∞13' north latitude and 84¬∞24' and 85¬∞15' east longitude in the southern post of the Saran Division of North Bihar. The Ganges river provides the southern boundary of the district, beyond which lie the districts of Bhojpur and Patna. To the north of Saran lie the districts of Siwan and Gopalganj. The Gandak river forms the dividing line with the Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts in the east. To the west of Saran lie the districts of Siwan and Balia in Uttar Pradesh. The Ghaghra river forms a natural boundary between Saran and Ballia. The district is shaped like a triangle; its apex is the confluence of the boundary of the Gopalganj district and the GandakGanges river. The district is made up entirely of plains, but several depressions and marshes create three broad natural divisions: * The alluvial plains along the big rivers, which are subject to periodic inundation. * The uplands away from the rivers, not subject to floods. * The riverbed diara areas. India's biggest double-decker flyover is being constructed in Chhapra.

He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. His major focus has been in the design and analysis of algorithms for discrete optimization problems. In particular, his work has highlighted the role of linear programming in the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. He is known for his pioneering research on providing first constant factor performance guarantee for several scheduling and clustering problems including the k-center and k-median problems and the generalized assignment problem. Polynomial-time approximation schemes that he developed for scheduling problems have found applications in many subsequent works. His current research includes stochastic optimization, computational sustainability and optimization techniques in computational biology. Shmoys is married to √âva Tardos, who is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. Key contributions Two of his key contributions are # Constant factor approximation algorithm for the Generalized Assignment Problem and Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling. # Constant factor approximation algorithm for k-Medians and Facility location problem. These contributions are described briefly below: =Generalized Assignment Problem & Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling= The paper is a joint work by David Shmoys and Eva Tardos. The generalized assignment problem can be viewed as the following problem of scheduling unrelated parallel machine with costs. Each of n independent jobs (denoted J ) have to be processed by exactly one of m unrelated parallel machines (denoted M ). Unrelated implies same job might take different amount of processing time on different machines. Job j takes p_{i,j} time units when processed by machine i and incurs a cost c_{i,j} , i=1,2,..,m; j=1,2,..,n; n \\\\geq m. Given C and T_i , i=1,2,..,m , we wish to decide if there exists a schedule with total cost at most C such that for each machine i its load, the total processing time required for the jobs assigned to it is at most T_i , i=1,2,..,m . By scaling the processing times, we can assume, without loss of generality, that the machine load bounds satisfy T_1=T_2=..=T_m=T. \`\`In other words, generalized assignment problem is to find a schedule of minimum cost subject to the constraint that the makespan, that the maximum machine load is at most T \\". The work of Shmoys with Lenstra and Tardos cited here gives a 2 approximation algorithm for the unit cost case. The algorithm is based on a clever design of linear program using parametric pruning and then rounding an extreme point solution of the linear program deterministically. Algorithm for the generalized assignment problem is based on a similar LP through parametric pruning and then using a new rounding technique on a carefully designed bipartite graph. We now state the LP formulation and briefly describe the rounding technique. We guess the optimum value of makespan T and write the following LP. This technique is known as parametric pruning. LP(T)::\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\\\sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} x_{ij} \\\\le C ; :: \\\\sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij} = 1 \\\\qquad j=1, \\\\ldots, n; :: \\\\sum_{i=1}^m p_{ij}x_{ij} \\\\leq T \\\\qquad i=1, \\\\ldots, m; :: x_{ij} \\\\geq 0 \\\\qquad i=1, \\\\ldots, m, \\\\quad j=1, \\\\ldots, n; :: x_{ij}=0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{if} \\\\qquad p_{ij} \\\\geq T, \\\\qquad i=1, \\\\ldots, m, \\\\quad j=1, \\\\ldots, n; The obtained LP solution is then rounded to an integral solution as follows. A weighted bipartite graph G=(W \\\\cup V, E) is constructed. One side of the bipartite graph contains the job nodes, W =\\\\\\\\{w_j  j \\\\in J\\\\\\\\}, and the other side contains several copies of each machine node, V=\\\\\\\\{v_{i,s}  i=1,2,..,m; s=1,2,..,k_i \\\\\\\\}, where k_i=\\\\lceil \\\\sum_{j} x_{ij} \\\\rceil. To construct the edges to machine nodes corresponding to say machine i , first jobs are arranged in decreasing order of processing time p_{ij} . For simplicity, suppose, p_{i1} \\\\geq p_{i2} \\\\geq \\\\ldots \\\\geq p_{in}. Now find the minimum index j_1 , such that \\\\sum_{i}^{j_1} x_{ij} \\\\geq 1. Include in E all the edges (w_j,v_{i1}, j=1,2,..,j_1-1) with nonzero x_{ij} and set their weights to x'_{v_{i1}j}= x_{ij} . Create the edge (w_{j_1}, v_{i1}) and set its weight to x'_{v_{i1}j_1}=1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{j_1-1} x'_{v_{i1}j} . This ensures that the total weight of the edges incident on the vertex v_{i1} is at most 1. If x'_{v_{i1}j_1} < x_{ij_1}, then create an edge (w_{j_1}, v_{i2}) with weight x'_{v_{i2}j_1}=x_{ij}-x'_{v_{i1}j_1} . Continue with assigning edges to v_{i2} in a similar way. In the bipartite graph thus created, each job node in W has a total edge weight of 1 incident on it, and each machine node in V has edges with total weight at most 1 incident on it. Thus the vector x' is an instance of a fractional matching on G and thus it can be rounded to obtain an integral matching of same cost. Now considering the ordering of processing times of the jobs on the machines nodes during construction of G and using an easy charging argument, the following theorem can be proved: Theorem: If LP(T) has a feasible solution then a schedule can be constructed with makespan T + max_{i,j} p_{i,j} and cost C . Since max_{i,j} p_{i,j} \\\\leq T , a 2 approximation is obtained. =K-medians and Facility Location Problem= The paper is a joint work by Moses Charikar, Sudipto Guha, √âva Tardos and David Shmoys. They obtain a 6 \\\\frac{2}{3} approximation to the metric k medians problem. This was the first paper to break the previously best known O(\\\\log{k}\\\\ \\\\log{\\\\log{k}}) approximation. Shmoys has also worked extensively on the facility location problem. His recent results include obtaining a 3 approximation algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem. The joint work with Fabian Chudak, has resulted in improving the previous known 5.69 approximation for the same problem. Their algorithm is based on a variant of randomized rounding called the randomized rounding with a backup, since a backup solution is incorporated to correct for the fact that the ordinary randomized rounding rarely generates a feasible solution to the associated set covering problem. For the uncapacitated version of the facility location problem, again in a joint work with Chudak he obtained a (1+2/e) \\\\approx 1.736 -approximation algorithm which was a significant improvement on the previously known approximation guarantees. The improved algorithm works by rounding an optimal fractional solution of a linear programming relaxation and using the properties of the optimal solutions of the linear program and a generalization of a decomposition technique.

History  The farmhouses of H√§lsingland are a cultural heritage and an example of traditional Swedish construction technique in the old farming society in H√§lsingland. The magnificent dwelling houses of the farms have become symbols of the term H√§lsingland farms, although the farm as a production unit, including out buildings and land, is what constitutes a H√§lsingland farm. The H√§lsingland farms reflect the rural construction techniques, using only wood, and are an expression of the popular architecture; the farmer‚Äôs way of building as it evolved according to the available means. To depict a general idea of the H√§lsingland farm is difficult as they vary between parishes and periods of time. The uniqueness of these farms lie in the farmer‚Äôs ambition to build big. The farms have large and elaborately decorated dwelling houses, often two or three, sometimes housing several generations, whereas some houses were used only for festivities and others for sleeping, so called ‚Äùbed-cottages‚Äù. Most often they were two stories, but there are also examples of one story cottages with room for two families. The well-constructed dwelling houses, often lavishly designed with profiled roof-bases, elegantly profiled joinery work around windows and beautifully decorated doorways, mainly represent the construction style of the 19th century, but there are also older farms with low, unpainted houses built in a square shape around the yard, as well as start-of-the-20th-century buildings with rich ‚Äùcarpenters joy‚Äù and large porches. For periods of time, each parish had their own style of constructing, mainly shown in the lavish front porches and otherwise elaborate entrances. Some areas, foremost the coastal parishes, lacked front porches entirely; instead they had more costly doors and door fittings. Inside the farms houses of H√§lsingland are magnificent and well-preserved interiors with art painted on the walls, stencilled wall decorations, and expensive wallpaper. Biblical motifs were transformed into H√§lsingland milieu, funny stories and cautionary tales mixed in the artwork with the decorative style of the wandering painters from Dalarna, characterized by religious motifs, ribbons and large flowers. Expensive, imported wallpaper was combined with popular painting into something entirely new, and the stencilled paintings in many places flowed onto walls, ceilings and fireplaces. The amount of well-preserved interiors kept in its original site, is unique in the world. With the farms in H√§lsingland also came a large number of out buildings, freely placed outside the courtyard. Grand barns, large log cabins, smithies, breweries, grain storage houses, stables and liveries all give a picture of the system of many outhouses, which by the end of the 19th century was replaced by large multifunctional buildings that housed many functions under the same roof. Often the farms of H√§lsingland are connected to other buildings such as mills, water works, and summer farms, providing us with a glimpse into the culture of H√§lsingland. The farms are placed in village structures of the olden days, with roots in prehistoric times, only partly changed from the original 19th century sites. Still today, there are around one thousand farmhouses of H√§lsingland preserved in the province. Some of them have been nominated to UNESCO list of World Heritage.

The story follows the Spirit of Ooga in the quest to help the Oogians exact revenge on the Boolis, after they tricked them into thinking their chiefs were evil, leading the Boolis to burn them. Gameplay Ancient of Ooga is a side- scrolling puzzle platformer where the player controls the Spirit, who can possess the other Oogians. Oogians are separated into tribes, each with different abilities, with the chief of each tribe having enhanced versions of those abilities. In addition to these special abilities, all Oogians have the ability to swallow and vomit certain objects on the ground. This can be useful as when you are holding an item, you cannot climb a ladder, and cannot hold another item, but you can hold an item in your hands and in your stomach simultaneously, which is useful in certain situations. Near the end of the game, all of the tribe leaders join together to summon the Ancient One at a Bone Fire, who is actually just an average human that the Oogians worship.

It is no longer active to unregistered users stating on its website: \\"Moogo is discontinued and we don't provide websites to new customers anymore. Sorry for any inconveniences.\\"  About Moogo  The name Moogo originated from the assumption that it didn't stand for anything disconcerting. In addition, the word resonates in any language, is easy to pronounce and has a playful tone to it.  Corporate History  Moogo's parent company, Ideakone, was established in Helsinki in 2005 by Mikko Nurminen and Antti Ala-Ilkka. Because of their entrepreneurial background in the field of technology, both founders had recognized a need for a simple to use digital communication software. Utilizing the SaaS model, and exploiting the extremely scalable business model and the unsaturated nature of the Finnish market, Ideakone launched their Finnish equivalent of Moogo - aptly branded as Kotisivukone - in 2006. Kotisivukone quickly established a foothold on the Finnish market and became a feasible option for users who were looking for quick and easy website hosting. The popularity of Kotisivukone grew at a rapid pace due to the advanced technology, which made the production and maintenance of individual websites unprecedentedly easy. The self-service concept and the automated invoicing and background systems created a basis, which permits to profitably serve large groups of customers at a price that is affordable for the end user. The accelerated growth on the domestic market enabled Ideakone to expand the service onto the international market. And in the spring of 2007, Moogo was launched. The first international market for Moogo was Finland's western neighbor Sweden. This international push continued in 2008, when Moogo's English language version was released.

He appeared in more than 30 films including Forever Amber, Destry Rides Again and Paris Underground. Vincent's family, the Fullard-Leo family, purchased the Palmyra Atoll (except for some minor islets) on August 19, 1922, for $70,000.00 from Henry Ernest Cooper, and established the Palmyra Copra Company. The family was involved, decades later, in a lawsuit with the United States government over ownership of the atoll. His heavy involvement in the lawsuit caused Vincent to retire from film. The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Fullard-Leo family in 1947. Once the lawsuit was settled, Vincent entered the hotel business in Hawaii.

LIASA was formed in 1997 in response to the need to unify a historically divided library profession that was also affected by the former apartheid policies of South Africa. From 2003 LIASA spearheaded a campaign to ensure that a national library week was observed by the entire library and information services (LIS) sector as an opportunity to raise the profile of libraries in South Africa especially amongst previously disadvantaged communities. This campaign has now resulted in South African Library Week (SALW) being recognized by government as a commemorative period on par with Water Week etc. when all types of libraries across the country use it as an opportunity to market their services to their users, the broader community, civil society and decision makers. It is hoped that these efforts would contribute to the understanding of the important role that libraries play in a democratic society, advancing literacy, making the basic human right of freedom of access to information a reality, and inculcating tolerance and respect among all South Africans. During this period LIASA aims to make all South Africans aware that libraries contribute to nation building and improve the quality of life of all who use them. History The customary celebration of library week exists in many countries. Such a tradition had been celebrated for some years in South Africa, mainly in the public library sector and spearheaded by the various Provincial Library Services. It was customary to celebrate this during the last two weeks of May. However, it is LIASA's vision to celebrate a truly inclusive Library Week across the entire country, one that will embrace all types of libraries and all kinds of users and potential users. To achieve this, LIASA spearheads all campaigns in its 10 branches in all nine provinces and decides on the annual theme and slogan for the week. The former Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology approved the name South African Library Week, abbreviated to SALW in 2001 and that this week is to be celebrated during the week of the 20th of March. This is a significant date in South African Library history and a significant week for democracy n South Africa for the following reasons: * The South African Public Library, now known as the National Library of South Africa (Cape Town) . was the first library to be established in South Africa. This was done by a government proclamation on 20 March 1818. The South African Library in fact started off as a true public library and has established itself as a pioneering institution in South African library history. * The date establishes a firm link between libraries and democracy as South Africa celebrates Human Rights Day on 21 March. The South African Constitution established access to information as a basic human right. The celebration of SALW aims to create an understanding of the importance of libraries and the vital role libraries play in a democratic society. This week is now strongly supported by the Department of Arts and Culture who oversee the development of public and community libraries in all nine provinces. School libraries and higher education libraries are under the purview of the Department of Basic Education and Department of Higher Education and Training respectively. The First SALW Although LIASA celebrated SALW as early as 2000 , during 18 to 23 March 2002 LIASA organized the first very successful SALW that was celebrated in all types of libraries nationwide with the slogan \\"\\"Free your mind - Read!\\" as supported and renamed by a democratic South African government. The announcements of the dates and slogan for the Week were widely publicised in 2001. Letters were sent to the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the national Department of Education as well as the MEC's of the nine provinces responsible for libraries. All warmly welcomed the initiative. SALW 2002 was launched in Etwatwa (Daveyton) and each branch organized an event in their region. Institutions across the country also staged activities to celebrate the Week. It is the Association's dream that South African Library Week will become a celebration of the country's intellectual and cultural heritage. Themes to date * 18‚Äì23 March 2002.

Libraries: Heart of the Community Promoting SALW LIASA has since taken the responsibility of commissioning promotional media designed to popularize the dates and theme. This includes posters, bookmarks, T-shirts, caps, book bags, newspaper adverts, etc. These are widely distributed to all its branches for further distribution to all types of libraries in their regions. The LIASA President is regularly interviewed by national television and regional radio stations on the significance of the theme as well as the importance of libraries for developing an informed nation. The Minister of Arts & Culture is often the keynote speaker at the official launch events held on the Saturday before the week-long activities. LIASA strongly believes that through such campaigns, libraries may be taken more seriously and accorded its rightful role in partnering education and development in South Africa References Moerat, N. 2003.

June 9), 1730) is one of the most renowned saints in the Greek Orthodox Church. Being a prisoner of war and a slave to a Turkish Agha, he became famous and respected even by his Muslim master for his humility, steadiness in faith and benevolence. His holy relics are undecayed and wonder-working; there are traditions that this saint particularly helps sick children and those who suffer from cancer. Life =Youth= St. John the Russian was born approximately in 1690 in Ukraine. Having come of age, he was recruited to the army of Peter the Great and took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1710‚Äì1711). During the war, he was captured prisoner and sold to slavery to the head of Turkish cavalry. =Life in slavery= The saint refused to adopt Islam and was humiliated and tormented for that by the Turks, who called him a kafir, which means \\"unbeliever\\". But as the time went by, the mockery had stopped due to saint's steadiness in faith, humility and diligence, and saint John became respected by his master and the household. He worked as a groom and lived in the stables. Other slaves mocked him for the zeal he was working with, but the pious man took no offence, trying to help them in their needs and comforting them when needed. For his sincere kind-heartedness, the saint had earned love and trust of the Agha who proposed him to live as a free man, in separate house. But he refused, saying: \\"My patron is Lord, and no one is above Him. He predestined me to live as a slave in a foreign land; seems, it must be so for my salvation\\". In the daytime John worked and prayed, keeping strict fast, and when the night came, he used to secretly go to the cave-church of St. George, where he said the prayers of All-Night Vigil. Every Saturday he used to take the Holy Communion. Soon the Agha became rich and one of the most influential people in Urgup. He decided, that it is due to the holy man, who lives in his home. Having become rich, the Agha decided to carry out the Hajj. During this travel, his wife was giving a dinner to the relatives and friends. When the master's favourite dish, pilau was being served, she told John, who was waiting upon the table: \\"How glad would your master be, if he could eat this pilau with us\\". The saint asked her to give him this dish, promising to send it to Mecca. Everybody was laughing, but John's request was complied, they decided he wanted to eat pilau himself or give it to the poor. When the Agha came back, he told about the miracle that had happened to him: while being in Mecca, he found a fuming plate of pilau in his locked room. And on this plate his name was engraved - as on every plate in his home. =Beginning of reverence= News of this miracle spread quickly, and everyone, even Muslims, began to call John a \\"Wali\\" - a \\"saint\\". However, he did not change the way he lived, and spent time doing hard work and praying. Before his death, he became seriously ill and, having no ability to stand up, asked for a priest to give him Holy Communion. The priest was afraid to openly go to a Muslim house and hid the Eucharist inside an apple. John the Russian died on June 9, 1730, some time after receiving the Holy Communion. He was buried in the church of St George in Prokopi in Cappadocia (now √úrg√ºp), and was revered as saint. When the Greeks had to leave Turkey in 1924, the people took his relics to their new home on the island of Euboea. Holy places worth visiting The relics of saint John are in the Church of Saint John the Russian in Neo Prokopion Prokopi in Euboea, Greece. His right hand is in the Russian Monastery of St Panteleimon on Athos. By the blessing of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow in 2003-2004 a small wooden church of St. John the Russian was erected in Moscow, in Kuntsevo district, a larger stone one was built nearby later and consecrated in 2016. In Novosibirsk, Russia the lower side chapel of the church of Our Lady of the Sign is also devoted to St. John the Russian.

Though unsuccessful in major competitions, Iharos ran world records over multiple distances and is one of only two athletes (the other being nine- time Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi) to have held outdoor world records over 1500 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres. Iharos was one of the star pupils of the famous coach Mih√°ly Igl√≥i. World records Iharos competed, without major success, in the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1954 European Championships. In 1955, however, Iharos turned a world-beater. His first individual world record (he had already been a part of two record-breaking Hungarian teams in the rare 4√ó1500 metres relay) was 7:55.6 minutes over 3000 metres, run on May 14. After this, Iharos broke in a rapid succession the world records for two miles (8:33.4), 1500 metres (3:40.8) and 5000 metres (13:50.8). The 5000 m record only stood eight days before broken by Volodymyr Kuts, but Iharos reclaimed it with a time of 13:40.6 on 23 October 1955. Iharos' records didn't last long, however. The 5000 m record was broken again on 19 June 1956 by Gordon Pirie, and this time he wasn't able to reclaim it. The 1500 m record was first equalled by L√°szl√≥ T√°bori and then beaten on 3 August 1956 by Istv√°n R√≥zsav√∂lgyi ‚Äì both fellow Hungarians and pupils of Igl√≥i. Iharos ran a new record on 15 July 1956, 28:42.8 over 10,000 metres, but this was smashed less than two months later by Kuts. Decline That would be Iharos' last individual record. (He'd be part of another Hungarian team effort in another rarely contested relay, 4 √ó one mile, in 1959.) The Hungarian team's date of departure for the 1956 Olympics in late October coincided with the beginning of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Iharos left Hungary, but not for Australia, citing an ankle injury. There has been speculation whether an injury or the political situation kept him from competing. Igl√≥i, however, did leave for Australia ‚Äì and didn't return to Hungary again. Without his coach and mentor Iharos soon lost his record-breaking form.

The law appropriated funds to federal and state loan programs to either rebuild diesel-powered vehicle engines to more stringent emission standards or install emission reduction systems, notify affected parties, and share the technological information with countries that have poor air quality standards.Energy Policy Act of 2005 Title VII, Subtitle G, Sections 791-797. August 8, 2005. Provisions =National Grant and Loan Programs= The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was charged with distributing DERA‚Äôs funds. 70% of these available funds are to provide grants and low-cost revolving loans. These loans are issued on a competitive basis to maximize reductions in diesel emissions in terms of number of tons of pollution and emissions exposure. DERA highlights that areas with a dense population of fleet vehicles and designated by the EPA as low air quality areas should receive priority for these funds. DERA also stipulates that at least 50% of the funds available should be distributed to public vehicle fleets. Of the total appropriated funds, 90% must be used for projects that use existing certified engine technology, or verified configuration, and that 10% should be used for developing and commercializing new technologies. Test plans for new technologies should be submitted to the EPA or California Air Resources Board (CARB). The funds cover retrofit engine technology for buses, medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, marine engines, locomotives, off-road engines or construction vehicles, cargo handlers, agricultural equipment, mining equipment, and energy production equipment. The funds are appropriated only for voluntary reduction of emissions and cannot be used to meet the requirements of any federal, state, or local laws for emissions standards. Additionally, states cannot themselves mandate the elective emissions reductions. =State Grant and Loan Programs= In addition to national loan programs, DERA made 30% of federally appropriated funds available to support state grant and loan programs that are designed to curb diesel emissions. These funds are designed to help the states meet diesel emissions reductions through the use of certified engine configurations or verified technologies only. This does not cover research and development of new technologies as in the federal grant program. States can apply for this aid through the EPA, which reviews the application and decides if a state is eligible for a monetary allocation. If all 50 states qualify for funding, each state receives 2% of the appropriated funds for the state grant and loan program. However, if all 50 states do not qualify, each qualifying state receives 2% plus a share that is population-dependent for that state. A state that matches the funds appropriated by DERA receives an incentive payment equal to 50% of the funds allocated by the state. =Evaluation and Report= DERA required the EPA to submit to Congress a report regarding the implementation of the federal and state grant and loan programs a year after funds were appropriated. The EPA released this report in August 2009, reporting its success of reducing 46,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 2,200 tons of fine particulate matter. This was reported as a public health benefit between $580 million and $1.4 billion and saved operators of fuel in 2008 (a cost savings of $8 million). The report stated that upwards of 14,000 diesel-powered engines were made cleaner under DERA, two-thirds of those being trucks and school buses through EPA sector outreach programs.United States Environmental Protection Agency. August 2009. Report to Congress: Highlights of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program. Retrieved April 21, 2011 from http://epa.gov/cleandiesel/documents/420r09006.pdf =Outreach and Incentives= The effect of DERA required that the EPA inform entities that are eligible or potentially eligible for federal and state programs.

Retrieved March 2, 2011, from http://www.epa.gov/diesel DERA also requires that the EPA share the technological resources regarding the retrofitting and modification of diesel engines to reduce emissions with foreign countries that have poor air quality standards. =Interaction with Other Laws= DERA clearly stipulates that any provisions made does not supersede any authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401‚Äì7626) on or before DERA's effective date. Legislative History =Origins Of the Bill Before it Became Law= The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010 was first introduced as the 5809 bill seen by the 111th House of Representatives. It was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 21st, 2010. It passed the House on September 22nd, 2010, and then moved on to the Senate. However, the Senate already had a bill in progress that did basically the same thing that H.R. 5809 did. That bill was the Voinovich- Carper Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010, which was the 3973 bill heard by the 111th Senate. S.3973 was first introduced to the Senate on November 18th, 2010, but never made it passed the Senate floor. Possibly because The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010 (H.R. 5809) was already making its way in the Senate. Ultimately the DERA that passed and became law was the one that was introduced by the House.https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th- congress/house-bill/5809/all- actions?r=4&overview;=closed#tabshttps://www.congress.gov/bill/111th- congress/senate-bill/3973/all-info =National Clean Diesel Campaign= The National Clean Diesel Campaign focuses on the health of Americans due to the exhaust emissions from diesel engines; specifically nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. It includes regulations for new diesel engines, voluntary programs for the existing diesel fleet, diesel emission reduction technologies and strategies, and current collaboratives and partnerships.United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Retrieved April 10, 2011 from http://www.epa.gov/cleandiesel/documents/420f05012.pdf =Differences in provisions of original bill and law in 2005= In July 2005, Wayne Nastri, Regional Administrator for Region 9 of the EPA, initially proposed the idea of a Diesel Emissions Reduction in the 109th Congress, 1st session. Nastri focuses on the negative health effects that diesel has on the environment. He concludes that diesel fuel, when burned, emits both nitrogen oxides and particulate matters. Nitrogen oxides contribute to smog, while the particle matter contributes to illness in humans. Nastri even states that diesel exhaust is a likely carcinogen. Nastri concludes his address by stating that even through the current efforts of the Clean Diesel Emissions Campaign, it will take a staggering amount of money that the EPA does not have. He acknowledges this however, and states he looks forward to working with the members of the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change & Nuclear Safety of the Committee on Environment & Public Works to reduce the health effects of diesel exhaust.Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, 109th Congress, 1st session. July 12, 2005. =Differences in provisions of DERA 2005 and DERA 2010= Under this renewal, DERA would be active until 2016, and the legislation would attempt to modify the program by adding a competitive bidding process for groups seeking funding. This bill would eligibility requirements for grants and low-cost loans to include individual owners and other private entities that manage diesel fleets and are contractors with the federal government. It would also require 95% of funds appropriated to be expanded in a given year on grants to eligible program participants. The bill would not authorize $100 million annually from fiscal year 2012 through 2016.Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010, 111th Congress, 2nd session. December 21, 2010. Support The Emissions Control Technology Association (ECTA), a coalition of a few hundred organizations that range from state and local government entities, to non-profit organizations and even private businesses and corporations, was one of the largest supporters of ECTA. On September 17, 2010, ECTA wrote a letter on behalf of its member organizations thanking Senators George Voinovich (R) and Tom Carper (D ‚Äì Delaware) for their bipartisan efforts in helping pass the 2010 renewal of DERA. This was a success for ECTA, whose mission is to achieve higher air quality through public policy that curbs harmful emissions. In the letter, ECTA states that more than $20 in healthcare savings is generated for every dollar spent on DERA, yielding a high cost-benefit ratio.Coalition letter to Senators Carper and Voinovich.

School history Built on Detroit's West side in the late 1950s, the school was completed in Fall 1962. Ford was built to accommodate the student overflow from Mumford, Redford, and Cooley high schools as population increased in this area. When it first opened, Ford's north-side was a bare cinder-block wall. When it was removed a few years later, the school's classroom sections were connected to the auditorium and gym. Less than three years after the January 1955 ground breaking ceremony, Detroit's Henry Ford High School (located on Evergreen Rd, between Trojan and Fargo) opened its doors to 9th and 10th grade students on September 5, 1957. The school was built on a site (costing $120,000), which was part of a parcel of land known as Southfield Woods. The building cost was $2.275M. At that time Ford consisted mainly of classrooms and a cafeteria ‚Äì there was no 11th or 12th grade until the fall of 1959. Ford had no gym, auditorium, or laboratory facilities. Its initial capacity was designed for 1,225 people. The initial enrollment was 1,541 students and 64 faculty. Construction of additional facilities were completed by the end of 1962.

Born and raised in Albany, New York, Lansing was trained as a lawyer, and was long involved in politics and government. During the American Revolution he was military secretary to General Philip Schuyler. Lansing served in the New York State Assembly from 1781-1784, in 1786, and in 1789, and was Speaker in 1786 and 1789. He served as a member of the Congress of the Confederation in 1785. From 1786 to 1790, Lansing served as mayor of Albany. He was a delegate to the federal Constitutional Convention in 1787 but withdrew from the body in July because he opposed the proposed United States Constitution as infringing on state and individual rights. He was a delegate to the New York ratification convention in June 1788, but was unable to prevent the Constitution from being approved. In 1790, Lansing was a member of the commission that settled the New York- Vermont boundary as part of Vermont's admission to the Union as the 14th state in 1791. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1790 to 1798, and chief justice from 1798 to 1801. He was Chancellor of New York from 1801 to 1814, and in 1817 he was a special commissioner to resolve New York City and New York County claims to land in Vermont. From 1817 until his death, Lansing was Regent of the University of the State of New York. He disappeared in December 1829, after leaving his New York City hotel room to mail a letter. No trace was ever found, and what happened to him is unknown. Early life John Ten Eyck Lansing Jr. was born on January 30, 1754, in Albany, New York. He was the son of Gerrit Jacob Lansing (b. 1711) and Jannetje \\"Jane\\" (n√©e Waters) Lansing (1728‚Äì1810). His younger brother was Abraham Gerritse Lansing (1756‚Äì1834), New York State Treasurer who married Susanna Yates, the daughter of Abraham Yates. Another brother, Sanders G. Lansing (1766‚Äì1850) married Catherine Ten Eyck (1769‚Äì1850), daughter of Abraham Ten Eyck (1744‚Äì1824) and Annatje (n√©e Lansing) Ten Eyck (1746‚Äì1823). Through his brother Abraham, he was the uncle of Gerrit Yates Lansing (1783‚Äì1862), a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Susan Yates Lansing (1804‚Äì1874), who was the second wife of Peter Gansevoort (1788‚Äì1876), son of Gen. Peter Gansevoort. Through his brother Sanders, he was the uncle of Robert Lansing (1799‚Äì1878), a New York State Senator and the grandfather of U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing. Career Lansing studied law with Robert Yates in Albany, New York, and was admitted to practice in 1775. From 1776 until 1777 during the Revolutionary War Lansing served as a military secretary to General Philip Schuyler. Afterwards he was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1780 to 1784, in 1785-86, and 1788‚Äì89, being its Speaker during the latter two terms. He served New York as a member of the Confederation Congress in 1785. In 1786, he was appointed Mayor of Albany. He represented New York as one of three representatives at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. His intentions at the convention were to follow the wishes of the New York Legislature which had elected him to attend. He was authorized only to amend the existing Articles of Confederation. As the convention progressed, Lansing became disillusioned because he believed it was exceeding its instructions. Lansing believed the delegates had gathered together simply to amend the Articles of Confederation and was dismayed at the movement to write an entirely new constitution. His desire was to see the Articles strengthened giving it a source of revenue, the power to regulate commerce, and to enforce treaties. He joined other prominent Anti-Federalists that strongly opposed Alexander Hamilton, James Wilson, and James Madison's notions of a strong centralized national government to replace the Articles. He, Luther Martin of Maryland, George Mason of Virginia, and Robert Yates, also of New York, strongly opposed the newly proposed United States Constitution because they thought it was fundamentally flawed and should be rejected because it infringed on the sovereignty of the independent States and did not do enough to guarantee individual liberty. Both he and Robert Yates walked out after 6 weeks and explained their departure in a joint letter to New York Governor George Clinton. Lansing and Yates never signed the constitution. At the New York Ratifying Convention that followed, he, along with Melancton Smith, took the lead in the debates as the leaders of the Anti-Federalist majority. Their attempts to prevent ratification ultimately failed by a narrow vote of 30 to 27. Lansing was appointed a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court in 1790 and on 15 February 1798 he was elevated to the post Chief Justice. In 1801, he also became the second Chancellor of New York, succeeding Robert R. Livingston. In 1814 he became a regent of the University of New York. Personal life On 8 April 1781, Lansing was married to Cornelia Ray (1757‚Äì1834), daughter of Robert Ray and Sarah (n√©e Bogart) Ray of New York City. Together, they were the parents of ten children, five of whom died young. Their children included: * Jane Lansing (1785‚Äì1871), who married Rensselaer Westerlo (1776‚Äì1851) in 1805. He was the son of Eilardus Westerlo and Catherine Livingston, herself the daughter of Philip Livingston and the widow of Stephen Van Rensselaer II. * Frances Lansing (1791‚Äì1855), who married Jacob Livingston Sutherland (1788‚Äì1845) in 1811. * Cornelia Lansing (1795‚Äì1877) * Sarah Ray Lansing (1797‚Äì1848), who married Edward Livingston (1796‚Äì1840) in 1819. His widow died in January 1834 and is buried at Albany Rural Cemetery. =Disappearance= On the evening of December 12, 1829, he left his Manhattan hotel to mail a letter at a dock in New York City, never to be seen again. Lansing was 75 years old and was presumed drowned or perhaps murdered; his body was never recovered. His fate was a major mystery in New York State at the time, rivaled only by the disappearance of William Morgan, the anti-Mason writer, in 1826 in upstate New York. In the last century it has become less publicized since the disappearance of New York State Justice Joseph Force Crater in 1930. Only one major clue to Lansing's disappearance has appeared since his death. In 1882 the memoirs of Thurlow Weed, former Whig and Republican political leader in New York State, were published by Weed's grandson T. W. Barnes. Weed wrote that Lansing was murdered by several prominent political and social figures who found he was in the way of their projects. According to Weed, his unnamed source showed him papers to prove it, but begged Weed not to publish them until all the individuals had died. Weed said they were all dead by 1870, but he did not wish to harm their respected family reputations, so upon advice of two friends he decided not to reveal what he had been told. =Legacy= The town of Lansing in New York was named after John Lansing.

His appointment was made against the wishes of the city mayor, who remained antagonistic to him and the changes he introduced in the musical content of services. The matter came to a head when Schelle replaced the Latin compositions written by Italian masters with music to German texts, especially cantatas. When the city council finally took Schelle‚Äôs side on the problem Schelle started the practice of introducing into the Protestant liturgy in Leipzig not only the Gospel cantata to German texts but later the chorale cantata, too.

He took over the archeparchy after the murder of Paulos Faraj Rahho in early 2008. Early life Nona, a Chaldo-Assyrian was born in Alqosh in 1967. After completing his secondary education in 1985, he entered the Chaldean Patriarchal Seminary and was ordained priest on 11 January 1991 in Baghdad. From 1993 to 1997 he was parochial vicar at Alqosh, then pastor until 2000. He then enrolled at the Pontifical Lateran University. In 2005 he obtained a doctorate in theology and returned home. From 2005 he served as a professor of anthropology at the Babel College. Later, he was named vicar general of the Chaldean Catholic eparchy (diocese) of Alqosh. He speaks Syriac, Arabic, Italian, and knows English. Archbishop of Mosul On May 5, 2009, the Synod of Bishops of the Chaldean Catholic Church elected Nona archeparch of Mosul of the Chaldeans. Pope Benedict XVI gave his consent to Nona's election on November 13, 2009. He was ordained a bishop on 8 January 2010, with Mar Emmanuel III Delly, patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans, as principal consecrator. At the age of 42, he was the youngest Catholic archbishop in the world. Speaking on the violence in Iraq in 2014 Nona said, all the Christians who were still living there have now fled. Nona, corroborated this while speaking with the worldwide Catholic relief service Aid to the Church in Need. ‚ÄúAll the faithful have left the city. Who knows whether they will ever be able to return,‚Äù Abp. Nona said. ‚ÄúIn 2003 there were still 35,000 faithful living in Mosul. Three thousand were still there in early 2014. Now probably not one is left here, and that is tragic,‚Äù the Archbishop declared. The city of Mosul, with a population of three million, was already mentioned in the Bible as Nineveh, and for thousands of years it has been a place of Christian civilisation. Archbishop Nona reported on the capture of Mosul: ‚ÄúWe have never experienced anything like it before. A major city like Mosul has fallen victim to chaos.‚Äù The fighting, he said, began on Thursday, June 5; at first, however, it was limited to several districts in the western part of the city. ‚ÄúThe army began to bombard the areas that were affected, but then the armed forces and the police suddenly left Mosul during the night between Monday and Tuesday, leaving the city at the mercy of the aggressors.‚Äù More than half of the inhabitants and the entire Christian community immediately fled to the nearby Nineveh Plain. ‚ÄúAt around 5:00 on Tuesday morning we took in the families of refugees and tried to lodge them in schools, catechism classrooms and abandoned houses,‚Äù Nona reported.Michael J.

A view that was informed in part from his experience in World War II and the early post-war environment. Biography =Early life and education= Barnes's father, George Brooke Barnes, died when he was 4, and young Philip, an only child, moved with his mother to Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.Clark, Peter Guardian 16 September 2009 In 1939 they were instructed to move to Chelmsford due to the fear of invasion after the outbreak of the Second World War. He began work as a junior clerk, aged 16, in a firm of chartered accountants and started an economics degree at Birkbeck College, University of London, while still working.Times 4 September 2009 In 1945 he was called up and served in military intelligence for more than three years, working in the Middle East and in India, where he first developed his great love of the sub-continent's culture.Times 4 September 2009 On his return, Barnes finished his economics degree at the London School of Economics, then read philosophy at Jesus College, Cambridge.Vaizey, Marina, Independent,12 September 2009 The environs of Cambridge and trips to Scandinavia were very influential not only on his personal life but also for the shaping of the ACE. His determination brooked few obstacles, including those to travel in remote places in the 1950s and 1960s, when few of the comforts that tourists now take for granted were available. =Career= He was already committed to worldwide horizons; unusually in the late 1940s he worked as a waiter in the US, and for a water company in Norway, long before the gap year had been invented. His first professional job after graduating was as a reporter for Reuters, posted to Denmark, where he was able to pursue what would become a lifelong interest in the Nordic countries. He immersed himself in Scandinavian culture well beyond the then popular understanding of its leadership in modern design and innovations in public welfare. He became a keen student of its medieval and renaissance history, which remained an abiding interest. His understanding of Denmark's adult education movement inspired him to devise courses in England for Scandinavian teachers to study English life, culture and language. On one of these he was to meet Inger Kragh: they married in 1962. In 1958 Barnes founded the Association for Cultural Exchange (now called ACE Foundation). An educational charity and non- profit company limited by guarantee. Barnes worked without pay for its first ten years, subsidising his fledgling organisation as a supply teacher and then as managing director of a publishing and printing firm that produced the Haverhill Echo and Liberal News. Tony Crowe and James Hockey of the Farnham School of Art were founding members of the organisation, as well as John Davies Evans of the Institute of Archaeology at London University. In the 1950s group cultural travel hardly existed, nor did overseas campuses for universities which would later proliferate. ACE was a pioneer in both at a time when severe currency restrictions hampered international travel. Conditions in university halls could be spartan, and the remodelling of colleges for the lucrative conference trade was still decades away. In ACE's first year a summer course at Exeter College, Oxford, for Scandinavian teachers was addressed by the former Prime Minister Clement Attlee, and Barnes wryly noted that the food improved just on that day. In its first three years the ACE also maintained a residential centre in the Suffolk village of Clare, housed in two redundant pubs. But Barnes soon eschewed the challenges of maintaining such a centre in favour of peripatetic courses emphasising travel, although he continued to run summer schools at Oxford for two decades. Courses were held in the UK and in Europe specifically for Americans, in European art and architecture, and for the English in the US, in American history and civilisation, notably at Ripon College in Wisconsin, 1959‚Äì60. Courses were also arranged for the University of Pittsburgh, as well as in Denmark and in Wales, examining the search for identity in modern democracies, and work in a free society, both well ahead of their time. Study tours of Denmark included visits to stately and royal homes. On one occasion, a tour group was asked to be particularly punctual for a visit to the Royal Summer Palace at Sofiero, Sweden. There they were received at the door by Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden himself, then in his 80s, who showed the visitors around personally. His passion for India led to scores of trips, initiated long before the hippy trail and at a time when international cultural travel to the sub-continent hardly existed. He started running tours to Mexico in 1974, Iran in 1975 and Peru in 1977. The ACE also sponsored archaeological digs, some of international importance, (notably at Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides) which have taught both amateurs and professionals; and 28 years of fellowships at UCL's Institute of Archaeology. In recent years subsidised British archaeologists have taught the techniques of aerial archaeology to newly liberated ex-communist countries, which in previous years could not have countenanced any form of aerial surveillance. At a time when the British were still uncomfortable and ill at ease with the notion of German culture, ACE led the way in specialist tours of Baroque and Rococo Teutonic achievements. Other early tours focused on Islamic Spain, the culture of China and the natural flora and fauna of New Zealand. He pressed on with cultural tours to Bolivia despite the revolutions and roadblocks so frequently encountered in that volatile country. Undaunted, his charity organised a cultural tour to Algeria in 2009, another first. Music festivals internationally and at home figured largely, as did trips to the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and the countries of South East Asia, including early visits to Cambodia when it reopened its borders to the outside world. As well as sustaining hundreds of study courses, the association's growing endowment fund supported scholarships for foreigners to study conservation and heritage methodology in Britain, archaeological fellowships, bursaries for overseas postgraduate students for the universities of York and Cambridge, a school in South Africa, street children in Addis Ababa and women's village education in India. In the early 1990s Barnes assumed a supervisory role, retiring from active tour leading, and was to hand over the role of managing director to his son Hugh. His son Paul later replaced him as charity secretary. The statistics over the past half-century for such a small travel charity are impressive: about 85,000 participants, 4,000 tours worldwide, 90 countries visited and hundreds of lecturers engaged.Ed. Barnes Paul, 50 Years of Cultural Travel, Association for Cultural Exchange. 2008. Several of the charity‚Äôs keenest patrons have taken more than 100 tours. The work of the charity has also been an inspiration to many others and cultural travel and adult education has expanded exponentially in the past half century. ACE Cultural Tours is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ACE Foundation and continues to provide cultural travel and study tours. The foundation supports educational projects worldwide and provides active learning courses for all ages.

Amiata derives its name from a mountain in southern Tuscany, in Italy. AMIATA's motto is \\"The Most Meaningful Sound Next to Silence\\", a phrase taken from a 1995 review of AMIATA releases in Audiophile Recording, a British audiophile magazine. Amiata records world music, ethnic music, folk, contemporary classical music, ancient music, jazz, relaxation music and electronic music. History The first AMIATA release was Ad Infinitum in 1992 by Italian composer and label founder Matteo Silva. For some years Amiata Records specialised in new music, releasing recordings by experimental artists like Michael Vetter and Gianfranco Pernaiachi; minimalistic composers like Terry Riley, Hans Otte and Steve Reich, vocalists like Sainkho Namtchylak, Faraualla, Amelia Cuni, saxophonist Angelo Ricciardi, flutist Andrea Ceccomori, guitarists Dominic Miller and Paolo Giaro, bassists Andrea Donati and Enzo Pietropaoli and string quartets like the Bernini Quartet. The label's repertoire consisting mostly of original compositions by the artists and often large booklets, sophisticated packaging and minimalist cover art. There is a link between some AMIATA recordings and so-called world music, especially the folk recordings and arrangements by the Fratelli Mancuso, the work of Antonio Infantino and Ustad Nishat Khan. Other examples of AMIATA's world music are records by the Bauls of Bengal, Tibetan Lama Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, Indian virtuoso Zakir Hussain, Gabin Dabir√© and the Ensemble Club musical Oriente Cubano. The AMIATA New Series was created to document Western contemporary classical works ‚Äî the first of these was the world-premiere recording of Hans Otte Aquarian Music who gave to the series a certain minimalist approach confirmed by other releases of music by Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Ludovico Einaudi, Arvo P√§rt. On many releases, the multicultural and classical sides of AMIATA are combined: for example, Ustad Nishat Khan's Meeting of Angels features him playing sitar solos over the Ensemble Gilles Binchois singing Gregorian chant. The label was distributed in the USA for many years by Ryko Distribution and after Warner Bros. Records acquisition of Ryko by the independent MVD Entertainment Group. Matteo Silva continues to take an active interest in the music released by the label, acting as producer on most of its recordings. The typical AMIATA session is just three days ‚Äî two days to record, one day to mix. Silva in general dislikes overdubbing. Catalogue The catalogue numbers over a hundred titles presented in seven series - Secret World, Roots, New Music, Cutting Edge, Inner Arts, Classica and Multimedia Arts.

The memoir was written about past episodes and encounters with family, friends, co-workers and complete strangers Hawn has met and known throughout her lifetime. Using a reflective writing style and introspection Hawn writes the memoir in a first person narrative from notes she had taken over the years from her personal diary. The memoir sold over 1 million copies and made the New York Times Bestseller list. The memoir is available in different formats, including hardback and paperback books, a CD or electronic audio book file format, which can be downloaded over the internet. Hawn does the entire audio voice herself and the running time is 5 hours and 43 minutes. The memoir is made up of 35 individual stories, which are separated by 16 mini-short-stories called \\"Postcards\\", consisting of poems, words of wisdom, and personal reflections. Inserted into the book are two major sections of photographs, 23 color photos and 33 black-and-white photos, as well as 10 other photos that are placed between stories. While the stories themselves are in a chronological order, not every event or person Hawn has ever known are discussed. At the conclusion of most of the stories, Hawn goes on to relate how those particular circumstances and encounters with people taught her valuable lessons and values in life. She also includes descriptions of how those pieces of knowledge could be passed on and used to teach children in the future. In the preface, Hawn points out that the main purpose of the book is to speak from her heart about past events along life's journey and how she has been affected and changed from those experiences and encounters which she calls her \\"Gifts\\". This spiritual quote, which led to the title of the book, Hawn received from the Venerable Thupten Ngodrup. He is the Nechung Oracle of the Nechung Dorje Drayang Ling Monastery in Dharamsala, India. \\"The lotus is the most beautiful flower, whose petals open one by one. But it will only grow in the mud.

The mud speaks of the common ground that humans share, no matter what our stations in life. ... Whether we have it all or we have nothing, we are all faced with the same obstacles: sadness, loss, illness, dying and death.

Based in Washington D.C., the USGLC advocates a higher International Affairs Budget in order to enhance national security, forward American business interests, and improve humanitarian assistance around the world. The International Affairs Budget is a component of the U.S. federal budget that funds many U.S. State Department activities and programs, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Peace Corps, the World Bank, aid to Israel, international development programs, and many other civilian-led programs abroad (including civilian reconstruction teams and democratic governance projects in Iraq and Afghanistan). History The USGLC was established in 1995 by Liz Schrayer when a diverse group of companies, NGOs, and foreign policy experts rallied together in response to Congressional funding cuts to the International Affairs Budget. Viewing diplomacy and international development programs as essential to improving national security and creating conditions for business expansion into new and friendly markets, the Coalition sought to engage with Capitol Hill, the White House, and local organizations from across the United States and educate them on the importance of the International Affairs Budget to Americans‚Äô security and prosperity. In July 2009 the primary focus of the USGLC shifted from advocacy toward education. Reflecting this, the organization's name changed to its current: ‚ÄúU.S. Global Leadership Coalition.‚Äù The Coalition continues to be involved in 501-c(4) activities, but they comprise a relatively small amount of the overall work done by the organization. The USGLC has expanded significantly since its first national events in the run-up to the 2008 elections. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci signed on as National Co-Chairs and launched the effort at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in July 2007. It now has field offices in South Carolina, Texas and Colorado. It plays an active role in key states nationwide by hosting political candidates and bringing together prominent political, business, and community leaders to discuss how federal diplomacy and development programs abroad benefited their local economy. Leadership Numerous prominent business and philanthropic leaders serve on the USGLC‚Äôs Leadership Boards. Members have been described as ‚Äústrange bedfellows‚Äù for the breadth of political backgrounds included, as well as prominent corporate and charitable personalities. The Coalition maintains three Advisory Councils. The policy council is composed of former members of Congress and Cabinet officials who advanced American global engagement during their careers. It includes every living former Secretary of State since Henry Kissinger, from both sides of the aisle. The National Security Advisory Council includes 160 retired three and four-starred generals and admirals representing all five branches of the Armed Forces who support diplomatic and development spending, alongside defense. The Business Advisory Council is chaired by Christopher Policinski. Jason Gross became Executive Director in 2016. Liz Schrayer remains the President & CEO. Mission The USGLC describes its mission as supporting, ‚Äúa smart power approach of elevating diplomacy and development alongside defense in order to build a better, safer world.‚Äù The three key reason it identifies to support this goal are enhancing national security and fighting terrorism, building economic prosperity and developing international markets; and strengthening humanitarian values by fighting disease, reducing hunger, expanding educational opportunities and strengthening democratic institutions globally. These goals are achieved through a combination of advocacy and education efforts. Political Campaign During the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, the USGLC ran a campaign entitled ‚ÄúImpact \`08: Building a Better, Safer World‚Äù to engage with each campaign and with voters and shine the spotlight on the International Affairs Budget. Impact \`08 held events throughout the country (particularly in Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and other battlegrounds) that brought together each state‚Äôs most prominent political, business, and community leaders to discuss specifically how federal diplomacy and development programs abroad benefited their local economy. Since 2008, the USGLC leadership also met with senior figures on every candidate‚Äôs campaign pressing them to provide a more detailed plan on foreign policy and the role of development and serving as a resource for campaigns‚Äô questions regarding the International Affairs Budget. The Coalition also hosted a series on ‚ÄúSalon Dinners‚Äù during the election with policy and journalist elites to discuss the role of diplomacy and development in the forthcoming Presidency. Attendees included Colin Powell, Bill Gates and Tom Daschle. Putting Smart Power to Work After the 2008 Election, the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition launched ‚ÄúPutting Smart Power to Work,‚Äù an initiative to work at both the grassroots level and directly with members of Congress in prioritizing and expanding the International Affairs Budget during the Obama Administration. The Coalition has continued to expand its grassroots network to develop a stronger voice amongst politicians‚Äô constituents and meets frequently with members of Congress and the Obama Administration. As part of ‚ÄúPutting Smart Power to Work,‚Äù the USGLC announced that it is partnering with numerous veterans groups under the banner of ‚ÄúVeterans for Smart Power‚Äù to encourage veterans to voice their support for civilian programs that complement the military‚Äôs efforts abroad. Global Plum Book The same day that the government published its ‚ÄúPlum Book‚Äù listing of available jobs for the incoming Administration, the USGLC released the ‚ÄúGlobal Plum Book,‚Äù a document that cataloged the top 100 positions across the new Obama Administration that would strongly impact the policies and programs for development and diplomacy. The Coalition identified hundreds of Democrats and Republicans that could potentially fill these positions and held meetings with these individuals to educate them on the Coalition‚Äôs priorities. The book was released during a widely attended forum on the transition moderated by Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour.

Cruisers was formed with the full knowledge, encouragement, and cooperation of the elder Thompson men and Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Co. In fact, for the first year of operation, Cruisers, Inc. made boats for Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Co. which were badged with the \\"Thompson\\" logo. By the mid 1950s Thompson Bros. Boat switched from primarily making cedar strip built hulls to plywood lapstrake boats. The greater horsepower outboard motors were better suited to the very strong yet lightweight lapstrake hulls. Effective 1 January 1959 the three boat operations owned by the Thompson family at Peshtigo, Cortland, and Oconto were split amongst family branches. Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Co. at Peshtigo became property of Ray Thompson and family. The former branch at Cortland, New York became Thompson Boat Company of New York, Inc. with ownership in the hands of brothers Bob and Ted Thompson, Jr. and their cousin Glenn Thompson. Brothers Roy and G.Grant Thompson gained sole ownership of Cruisers at Oconto. All three firms made wooden lapstrake outboard boats. In 1960 Glenn Thompson decided to return to Wisconsin and venture out on his own. He established T & T Boats, Inc. and a factory was built in Wausaukee, Wisconsin. T & T also made wooden lapstrake outboard and inboard/outboard boats. It lasted until a liquidation auction signaled the firm's end in May 1965. Thompson Bros. Boat at Peshtigo was one of the earliest boatbuilders to embrace the new inboard/outboard propulsion unit that was introduced to the boating public at the New York Boat Show in early 1959. Volvo Penta of Sweden was the first to make a practical inboard/outboard engine and outdrive. By the summer of 1959 Thompson was installing these in their 17-ft. Sea Lancer and 19-ft. Off-Shore models as options.Rhude, Andreas Jordahl. \\"Thompson Marine Enterprises\\". The Boathouse, April 1998, pp. 12‚Äì15. The transition from wood to fiberglass at all the Thompson operated boat firms was difficult. The family resisted the switch and felt that any high quality wooden boat could out perform, outlast, and outsell fiberglass; however, the 1960s consumer shied away from wood and purchased fiberglass or aluminum pleasure boats, and sales plummeted. =Twilight years= Thompson Boat Company of New York, Inc. of Cortland, New York was purchased by Chris-Craft Industries in January 1962 and it became a wholly owned subsidiary. An immediate program of fiberglass boat development began. This initiative created the Corsair fiberglass division of Chris-Craft. The Corsair boats were made by Thompson Boat Company of New York in Cortland. In late 1964 Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Co. at Peshtigo, Wisconsin subcontracted with Crownline, Inc. of Cairo, Illinois to have the latter make fiberglass boats for them. This was a low cost means for Thompson to get an abbreviated line of fiberglass boats to supplement their wooden boat line. The arrangement did not last long as Crownline was having major financial difficulties. When Crownline closed down, Peter Thompson - the grandson of the original Peter Thompson - and another team member went to Cairo and retrieved the Thompson molds and tooling. It was too little and too late. The Thompson creditors in 1966 forced the sale of the company and Saul Padek got control of all the stock for less than $4,000 cash layout. The Thompson family was out of the boat business at Peshtigo. Under Padek's ownership Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Co. declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 1966. Padek began the slow painful switch from wood to fiberglass and by 1969 the last wooden boat rolled out of the plant at Peshtigo. Cruisers, Inc. also resisted the change from wood to RFP. Grant Thompson researched markets, production methods, designs, and costs. Slowly they began making some fiberglass products. The relationships they had made with other boat makers over the years paid off. Cruisers, Inc. was able to get licensing deals with other entrenched fiberglass builders. This helped ease them from wood to glass. By 1967 they had dropped all wooden boats from their product line. The financial loss was significant. The company went from one of the most successful in the industry to just barely hanging on in a matter of a few years. The rebuilding took many years. Today, this is the only Thompson originated boat firm that still operates. It is called Cruisers Yachts and is a division of KCS International.Rhude, Andreas Jordahl. \\"Thompson-Cruisers Boats Gather\\". Vintage Boating Life, September‚ÄìOctober 2003, pp. 24‚Äì26. T & T Boats of Wausaukee never made fiberglass boats. A liquidation auction in May 1965 signalled their demise. Chris-Craft closed the Cortland plant in 1974 which had been a Thompson operation. Thompson Boat at Peshtigo went bankrupt and closed in 1980. A Thompson dealer in the Detroit area bought the assets from the bankruptcy court and the entire operation was moved from Peshtigo to St. Charles, Michigan that year. 76 years of boat building tradition at Peshtigo came to an end. The revitalized Thompson Boat at St. Charles slowly rebuilt, but bankruptcy was declared in 1993. A new owner came in and got the firm going again. By about 1997 regular production ceased and all boat production stopped by 2000 or 2001. A liquidation auction in 2002 signaled the end of almost 100 years of boat building history.

It appeared in his monumental multi-volume work completed in 1861, The Greek Testament, which is still consulted today. Content Alford presented the rule as follows with specific reference to the first resurrection in Rev. 20:4‚Äì6: :\\"If, in a passage where two resurrections are mentioned, where certain \\"souls lived\\" at the first, and the rest of the \\"dead lived\\" only at the end of a specified period after that first, - if in such a passage the first resurrection may be understood to mean spiritual rising with Christ, while the second means literal rising from the grave; then there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything. If the first resurrection is spiritual, then so is the second, which I suppose none will be hardy enough to maintain. But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the whole primitive Church and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain, and receive as an article of faith and hope.\\"Henry Alford, The Greek Testament, 4 volume ed., Vol. IV, s.v. Rev. 20:5. George Eldon Ladd refers to this Law and cites the quote above in support of his position on Historic Premillennialism and the interpretation of the Book of Revelation chapter 20.

(Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1952), II:291. Peters also referenced Alford's statement at II:281, note 3. :\\"It will have been long ago anticipated by the readers of this commentary, that I cannot consent to distort its words from their plain sense and chronological place in the prophecy, on account of any considerations of difficulty, or any risk of abuses which the doctrine of the Millennium may bring with it. Those who lived next to the Apostles, and the whole Church for three hundred years, understood them in the plain literal sense; and it is a strange sight in these days to see expositors who are among the first in reverence of antiquity, complacently casting aside the most cogent instance of unanimity which primitive antiquity presents. As regards the text itself, no legitimate treatment of it will extort what is known as the spiritual interpretation now in fashion. If, in a passage where two resurrections are mentioned, where certain souls came to life at the first, and the rest of the dead came to life only at the end of a specified period after the first [v. 5a]‚Äîif in such a passage the first resurrection may be understood to mean spiritual rising with Christ, while the second means literal rising from the grave‚Äîthen there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything.

But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the primitive church and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain and receive as an article of faith and hope.\\" Wayne Grudem cites the rule only to discredit it: :\\"There is no fixed rule in any language that when a word is used twice in close succession it must be used in the same sense both times.

Process Kundan jewellery is created by setting carefully shaped, uncut diamonds and polished multicoloured gemstones into an exquisitely designed pure gold or faux metal base. The elaborate process begins with the skeletal framework called Ghaat. Thereafter, the Paadh procedure takes place, during which wax is poured onto the framework and moulded according to the design. Following this is the Khudai process, when the stones or uncut gems are fit into the framework. Meenakari then involves enameling to define the design details. Next, the Pakai process involves gold foils that hold the gems onto the framework; these are cold soldered using burnishing techniques. Finally, the gems are polished using the Chillai process.

The newly elected president Francois Hollande, announced in June 2012 that he would be withdrawing 2,000 of France's 3,400 troops in Afghanistan, leaving 1,400 for training and logistics.USA Today, 8 June 2012, Bomber kills 4 French troop in Afghanistan In November 2012, France's combat troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan, leaving just the logistical contingent in the country.  Mission  The official mission statement for French military in Afghanistan in French forces support anti-drug operations, though destruction of opium fields and capture of dealers is not part of their mission. When prisoners are captured during combat, they are surrendered to Afghan authorities.  History  The attacks of 11 September 2001, triggered Article 5 of the NATO treaty, stating that an attack against any member would be regarded as a direct attack on all parties. Although France was not bound by this clause, it pledged armed forces at the side of its allies. = Legal context and UN mandate = On 20 December 2001, Resolution 1386 of the United Nations Security Council created the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Its mandate is = Op√©ration H√©rakl√®s = From 21 October 2001, Op√©ration H√©rakl√®s came in force, with the deployment of twenty Mirage IVP and twenty C-135FR at the air base of Al Dhafra. These planes carried out 800 one-hour reconnaissance missions over Afghanistan, after crossing the Sea of Oman and part of Pakistan, until they were drawn back to France on in February 2002. Afghanistan: les 80 missions des Mirage IV, fin 2001, Secret D√©fense, 9 May 2009 On 21 November 2001, the aircraft carrier and her battle group were deployed in the Indian Ocean to support NATO operations in Afghanistan.

On 27 December 2001, Task Force 473 was integrated into a multinational force also comprising the aero-naval groups of and , and the Italian , amounting to over 100 ships in total. On 18 February 2002, a Helios 2A satellite spotted suspicious activities on the ground near Gardƒìz. After confirmation by two Super √âtendards and by US special forces, Operation Anaconda was launched by US and British forces. The attempted capture of wanted leaders ended in failure as the incomplete surrounding allowed them to flee. In March 2002, a rescue unit was created under the name of RESAL (√©quipe de Recherche Et Secours A√©roLargu√©e) to help pilots should they be downed over Afghanistan. In March, eight Super √âtendards and six Mirage 2000 targeted several suspected Al Qaida targets on request from US forces. US President George Bush stated From February, Charles De Gaulle and John C. Stennis exchanged aircraft in joint exercises. = Land deployment = On 15 November 2001, the first French soldiers of the 21st RIMA landed in Afghanistan, Mazar-E-Sharif and North of Kabul. They amounted to 640 men, of whom 400 were deployed under the aegis in the ISAF.

A tenth soldier died in a related road accident. These losses, the heaviest in France since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, shocked the public opinion and prompted or accelerated deployment of items requested by the military, particularly drones and tele-operated turrets for VABs.

Old Book of Tang, vol. 17, part 2.), courtesy name Nanshi (), was an official of the Chinese Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Wenzong.  Background  Lu Sui was born in 776, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His ancestors were originally from Yangping (ÈôΩÂπ≥, in modern Hanzhong, Shanxi). His great-great-grandfather Lu Jie () served on staff of Li Zhen the Prince of Yue (an elder brother of Emperor Daizong's great-great-grandfather Emperor Gaozong); his great-grandfather Lu Weishu () served as a prefectural prefect; and his grandfather Lu Junzhi () served on the staff of a crown prince.Old Book of Tang, vol. 159. Lu Sui's father Lu Mi () was known for being learned and studious. When, during the revolt of the general Zhu Ci against Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong was forced to flee the capital Chang'an, first to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and then to Xingyuan (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong), Lu Mi followed the emperor in his flight, leaving his wife and children at Chang'an. During flight, he was also injured when stricken by an arrow. He eventually came to serve under the important imperial general Hun Jian and was much respected by Hun, and he participated in Hun's campaign against another rebel general, Li Huaiguang, as Hun's secretary. He was with Hun in 787 when Hun met with the Tufan prime minister Shang Jiezan () to sign a peace treaty ‚Äî when Shang laid a trap for Hun, intending to capture Hun; Hun escape, but many of his staff members were captured or killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Lu Mi was captured and taken to the Tufan capital Lhasa. It was said that in his years at Lhasa, Lu Mi became well-learned in Buddhism, and was much respected by Tufan's king, but was never allowed to return to Tang until his death. When Lu Mi was captured, Lu Sui was just a child, and it was said that after he grew up and found out that his father had been captured by Tufan, he would often weep day and night, and whenever he sat, he would face the west (toward Tufan); he also did not eat meat to mourn his father's capture. Because his mother told him that his appearance resembled his father's, he would refuse to look at mirrors. In 803, when Tufan sent letters offering peace, Lu Sui made three petitions to Emperor Dezong, begging for peace ‚Äî such that Emperor Dezong sent an imperial eunuch to explain to him that Emperor Dezong distrusted Tufan offers of peace and was waiting for further proof of Tufan's good faith. Such proof never came for several years, however, and no further peace talks were held at that point.  Early career  Eventually, Lu Sui passed the imperial examinations in the Mingjing () class, and he was made a military advisor at Run Prefecture (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), which was then controlled by the warlord Li Qi, the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered at Run Prefecture). Li Qi wanted to humiliate Lu, so he made Lu be in charge of the market, but Lu, unembarrassed, sat in the market while overseeing it.New Book of Tang, vol. 142.As Li Qi rebelled against the imperial government and was defeated and killed in 807, these events must have occurred prior that point. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. When Wei Xiaqing () the defender of the eastern capital Luoyang heard about this, he was impressed with Lu and invited Lu to serve on his staff, which furthered Lu's reputation.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Meanwhile, by this point, Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong was emperor, and Tufan made periodic overtures of peace. Lu submitted five petitions to Emperor Xianzong arguing for peace and further also petitioned the chancellors; thereafter, the chancellors Pei Ji and Li Fan both spoke on his behalf as well. After peace was finally reached with Tufan, in 810, at the request of Emperor Xianzong, Tufan returned the caskets of Lu Mi and his colleague Zheng Shuju (), as well as their tombstones and writings. Emperor Xianzong bestowed posthumous honors on Lu Mi and had him buried at state expense.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Lu Sui observed a mourning period for his father, and after the mourning period was over, was made Zuo Bujue (), a low-level advisory official at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). Once, when the chancellor Li Jiang suggested that Emperor Xianzong listen more to advisory officials, Emperor Xianzong cited Lu and Wei Chuhou as two examples of advisory officials that he listened to. He was also made an editor of imperial history. He was subsequently made an imperial chronicler (Ëµ∑Â±ÖÈÉé, Qijulang), and then Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and continued to serve as an imperial history editor.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. After Emperor Muzong's ascension, Lu Sui was promoted to be Sixun Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs, and both he and Wei Chuhou also became assistant imperial scholars at Hanlin Institute (). He was later made Jianyi Daifu (), a mid-level advisory official and continued to serve as assistant imperial scholar. As Emperor Muzong was commissioning the editing of the chronicles of Emperor Xianzong's reign, he again made Lu an editor as well.  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  Emperor Muzong died in 824 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Jingzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. Lu Sui was thereafter promoted to be Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and full imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). When people sent congratulatory gifts of gold and silk, he responded, \\"How should I receive private wealth for a public matter?\\" and returned the gifts. Around new year 827, Emperor Jingzong was assassinated by eunuchs and imperial guard officers who were resentful of his temper. The leading eunuch involved in the conspiracy, Liu Keming (), thereafter had Lu draft a will on Emperor Jingzong's behalf entrusting the matters of state to Emperor Muzong's younger brother Li Wu the Prince of Ji√†ng, but soon, a group of powerful eunuchs, including the directors of palace communications Wang Shoucheng and Yang Chenghe () and the commanders of the Shence Armies () Wei Congjian () and Liang Shouqian () counteracted against the conspirators and slaughtered them. In the aftermaths, Wang, after consulting with Wei Chuhou, had an edict issued in the name of Emperor Muzong's mother Grand Empress Dowager Guo naming Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Li Han (whose name was then changed to Li Ang) the Prince of JiƒÅng (note different tone than Li Wu) emperor (as Emperor Wenzong).  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  Lu Sui appeared to not be considered a conspirator in the assassination of Emperor Jingzong, for he suffered no reprisals in the aftermaths ‚Äî and as Wei Chuhou, who was then chief imperial scholar, was named chancellor soon after Emperor Wenzong's ascension, Lu was named chief imperial scholar to succeed him. He was thereafter made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) but was also responsible for drafting edicts. After Wei died in 828, he was made the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, Zhongshu Shilang) and chancellor de facto with the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). He also became responsible for overseeing the editing of the imperial history. While Lu was serving as the lead editor of the imperial history, he became involved in a controversy over the editing. Previously, when Han Yu had been responsible for editing the chronicles of the reign of Emperor Xianzong's father Emperor Shunzong, Han wrote about much of what was going on in the palace, and that led to resentment by eunuchs, who often told the emperors that the chronicles were untrue. After Lu submitted the chronicles of Emperor Xianzong's reign to Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Wenzong ordered him to modify the chronicles of Emperor Shunzong's reign, which led Lu to submit a softly-worded apology about the inaccuracies and yet defended the integrity of the officials involved, as well as their independence as historians. As a result, Emperor Wenzong issued a modified order that suggested that, to the extent that there were references to events in the palace during Emperor Dezong's and Emperor Shunzong's reigns that could not be corroborated that those references should be removed, but that the chronicles should otherwise remain untouched. In 829, at Lu's suggestion that it was inappropriate for chancellors to also oversee the finances of the state ‚Äî citing past corrupt chancellors Yang Guozhong, Yuan Zai, and Huangfu Bo as examples ‚Äî Lu's senior colleague Pei Du resigned his financial responsibilities to serve just as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. In 830, Lu was made Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau, and was given the additional title of senior scholar at Chongwen Pavilion (). In 833, he was also made a senior advisor to Emperor Wenzong's son and crown prince Li Yong; it was also that year that submitted chronicles of Emperor Xianzong's and Muzong's reigns to Emperor Wenzong. In 834, he offered to resign due to illness, but the resignation was not accepted. In 834, when Emperor Wenzong's close associate Zheng Zhu accused the former chancellor Li Deyu of conspiring with Du Zhongyang () the wet nurse of Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Cou the Prince of Zhang, Lu not only did not cosign the accusation but further tried to defend Li Deyu, thus drawing Zheng's ire.

IWM enables the management and optimization of computing resources in a secure and compliant manner across physical, virtual and cloud environments to deliver business services for end customers. The IWM paradigm builds on the traditional concept of workload management whereby processing resources are dynamically assigned to tasks, or \\"workloads,\\" based on criteria such as business process priorities (for example, in balancing business intelligence queries against online transaction processing), resource availability, security protocols, or event scheduling, but extends the concept into the structure of individual workloads themselves. Definition of \\"workload\\" In the context of IT systems and data center management, a \\"workload\\" can be broadly defined as \\"the total requests made by users and applications of a system.\\" However, it is also possible to break down the entire workload of a given system into sets of self-contained units. Such a self-contained unit constitutes a \\"workload\\" in the narrow sense: an integrated stack consisting of application, middleware, database, and operating system devoted to a specific computing task. Typically, a workload is \\"platform agnostic,\\" meaning that it can run in physical, virtual or cloud computing environments. Finally, a collection of related workloads which allow end users to complete a specific set of business tasks can be defined as a \\"business service.\\" Making workloads \\"intelligent\\" A workload is considered \\"intelligent\\" when it a) understands its security protocols and processing requirements so it can self- determine whether it can deploy in the public cloud, the private cloud or only on physical machines; b) recognizes when it is at capacity and can find alternative computing capacity as required to optimize performance; c) carries identity and access controls as well as log management and compliance reporting capabilities with it as it moves across environments; and d) is fully integrated with the business service management layer, ensuring that end user computing requirements are not disrupted by distributed computing resources, and working with current and emergent IT management frameworks. Intelligent workloads and security in the cloud The deployment of individual workloads and workload-based business services in the \\"hybrid distributed data center,\\"  including physical machines, data centers, private clouds, and the public cloud - raises a host of issues for the efficient management of provisioning, security, and compliance. By making workloads \\"intelligent\\" so that they can effectively manage themselves in terms of where they run, how they run, and who can access them, intelligent workload management addresses these issues in a way that is efficient, flexible, and scalable. The 1989 seminal work by D.F. Ferguson, Y. Yemini, and C. Nikolaou \\"Microeconomic Algorithms for Load Balancing in Distributed Computing Systems\\" developed a theory by which workloads could be made \\"intelligent\\" to manage themselves. This theory has since been patented and was commercialized by the Boston-based company, VMTurbo, in 2009.

It was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick and began trading energy in September 2009, buying and selling electricity and gas to supply domestic properties throughout the UK. As of June 2017 OVO had 680,000 customers, an increase of 10,000 over the previous year, representing a 2.5% domestic market share. In November 2018, OVO Energy acquired one of its largest competitors, Spark Energy. Although at first one of over 15 smaller energy companies competing with the Big Six which dominate the market, in January 2020 OVO completed the acquisition of the retail arm of SSE, becoming itself one of the Big Six and the country's second largest energy supply company.  Overview  The company sources energy from various suppliers throughout the UK and from further afield. OVO Energy's headquarters are in Bristol. The company is British-owned and privately backed. OVO Energy has been supplying gas and electricity to domestic customers since 2009, and to business customers since 2013. This sector of the UK economy is dominated by a number of larger companies known as the Big Six. On 14 February 2019, Mitsubishi Corporation bought a 20 percent stake in OVO, valuing the company at ¬£1bn. OVO Energy is part of OVO Group, which in turn is a subsidiary of Imagination Industries Ltd, a holding company wholly owned by Stephen Fitzpatrick.  Acquisitions  The 2018 acquisition of Spark Energy included a subsidiary, Home Telecom Limited, which specialises in providing telephone and broadband services to tenants of private landlords. In September 2019, OVO agreed to pay ¬£500 million for SSE Energy Services, the retail business of SSE plc, and the purchase ‚Äì which included SSE's 8,000 employees and their phone, broadband and heating insurance customers ‚Äì was completed in January 2020. This made OVO the UK's second-largest energy supply company (after British Gas) with around 5 million customers. OVO stated that the SSE brand would continue for the time being. SSE had earlier intended to merge the business with Innogy, the German owner of the nPower brand, but this was called off in December 2018.  Regulator action  In January 2020, OVO Energy agreed to pay ¬£8.9m into Ofgem's voluntary redress fund, after an investigation by Ofgem found instances of undercharging and overcharging, and inaccurate annual statements sent to more than half a million customers between 2015 and 2018. Head of Ofgem enforcement, Anthony Pygram, said \\"The supplier did not prioritise putting these issues right whilst its business was expanding.\\"  Electricity  Electricity supplied by OVO Energy comes from various sources including wind farms in Gloucestershire and North Wales, and the burning of landfill gas. Its two tariffs include 50% green electricity (OVO Better Energy) and 100% green electricity (OVO Greener Energy). OVO's \\"pay as you go\\" product has been branded as Boost since 2017. After taking on customers from Economy Energy in 2019, the brand had around 350,000 customers.  Gas  OVO Energy sources its gas from the national grid. The majority of the UK's gas is sourced from the North Sea; the rest comes from Norway, Continental Europe and some from further afield. Increasingly, gas is imported as liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas cooled to about ‚àí165 ¬∞C and compressed to make it easier to transport.  Energy market competition  The entry of OVO into the UK supply market in 2009 was welcomed as it increased competition in a market that had been criticised for high prices. In October 2013, Managing Director Stephen Fitzpatrick appeared at the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, when energy companies were asked to justify recent gas and electricity price rises. Fitzpatrick explained to the committee that the 'wholesale gas price had actually got cheaper', contrary to the Big Six energy suppliers' assertions that international global prices of gas and electricity had consistently risen. In November 2018, OVO acquired one of its rivals, Spark Energy, after the troubled supplier ceased trading. Following the collapse of Economy Energy in January 2019, regulator Ofgem announced that OVO Energy would take on Economy Energy's 235,000 customers.  Sponsorship  In 2016, OVO sponsored the Bristol leg of the Tour of Britain cycling race. In 2017, the company began sponsoring both The Women's Tour and the Tour of Britain, the longest cycle stage races taking place in the UK. In March 2018, OVO announced they would begin providing equal prize money for both tours.

In 1869 a Theological Seminary was established here by the Gereformeerde Kerk, but in 1905 it was moved to Potchefstroom, acting as an instrument in the formation of the PUK in 1919, then becoming the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education in 1951. The Afrikaner Bond political party was founded in Burgersdorp in 1881. Demographics According to the 2011 census, the town of Burgersdorp proper has a population of 5,240, while the adjacent townships of Mzamomhle and Tembisa have populations of 4,656 and 6,094 respectively, giving the urban area a population of 15,990. Of this population 78.1% described themselves as Black African, 11.98% as Coloured and 9.4% as White. 69.2% spoke Xhosa as their home language, 20.1% spoke Afrikaans, 3.3% spoke Sotho, 1.4% spoke English as their home language and 6.0% spoke some other language.

Dutch Reformed Church This church was declared a provincial heritage site in 1996. Blockhouse Anglo-Boer War blockhouse in spring A Second Boer War blockhouse overlooking the town, commonly known as the Sentinel was declared a provincial heritage site in 1939. Dutch Language Monument A monument to Dutch, built in 1893 is located in the town. The monument depicts a woman pointing her finger at a book in her hands. This monument was declared a provincial heritage site in 1937. Although the main inscription on that monument refers to the Hollandse taal (Dutch language), it can be understood to mean Afrikaans, because the Hollandse taal in South Africa was only split since 1925. But the monument is officially recognised as a monument to Dutch. The monument was damaged during the Anglo- Boer War, and Lord Milner had it removed. It was replaced with a replica in 1907. The original was later discovered in King William's Town in 1939, and moved back to stand next to the replica in Burgersdorp. Some sources claim that Lord Milner had removed the original monument not because it was damaged, but because he was opposed to Dutch (and Afrikaans), and that the replica was built not by government but by a group of Afrikaners.

The Colorado Amendment 64, which was passed by voters on November 6, 2012, led to legalization in January 2014. The policy has led to cannabis tourism. There are two sets of policies in Colorado relating to cannabis use: those for medicinal cannabis and for recreational drug use along with a third set of rules governing hemp. History =Prohibition (1917)= Amidst an early 20th century trend of limiting the drug, Colorado first restricted cannabis on March 30, 1917. In November 1914 Colorado voters approved the 22nd Amendment to the Colorado Constitution, also known as the Prohibition Amendment, prohibiting alcohol beginning January 1, 1916; and on December 18, 1917 the Eighteenth Amendment (establishing Prohibition) was proposed by Congress. Shortly after the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act went into effect on October 1, 1937, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Denver Police Department arrested Moses Baca for possession and Samuel Caldwell for dealing. Baca and Caldwell's arrest made them the first marijuana convictions under U.S. federal law for not paying the marijuana tax. Judge Foster Symes sentenced Baca to 18 months and Caldwell to four years in Leavenworth Penitentiary for violating the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. =Prosecution (1917-Present)= In 1975, during a decade- long wave of increased penalties and prosecutions in the country, including dramatic increases in the length of prison sentences, a 53% increase in drug arrests, a 188% increase in the number of people arrested for marijuana offenses, and a 52% increase in the number of people in state prisons for drug offenses, Colorado continued to prosecute people and incarcerate individuals for marijuana possession. The War On Marijuana: In Black And White A contributing factor in the favor of decriminalization was the work on behalf of NORML by Pitkin County Deputy District Attorney Jay Moore, who helped win over the legislature's Republican leadership with arguments as to money wasted on needless enforcement of marijuana laws. =Medical marijuana (2000)= On November 7, 2000, 54% of Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the State Constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state for approved patients with written medical consent. Under this law, patients may possess up to of medical marijuana and may cultivate no more than six marijuana plants (no more than three of these mature flowering plants at a time). Patients who are caught with more than this in their possession may argue \\"affirmative defense of medical necessity\\" but are not protected under state law with the rights of those who stay within the guidelines set forth by the state. Furthermore, doctors, when making a patient recommendation to the state can recommend the rights to possess additional medicine and grow additional plants, because of the patient's specific medical needs. Conditions recognized for medical marijuana in Colorado include: cachexia; cancer; chronic pain; chronic nervous system disorders; epilepsy and other disorders characterized by seizures; glaucoma; HIV or AIDS; multiple sclerosis and other disorders characterized by muscle spasticity; and nausea. Additionally, patients may not use medical marijuana in public places or in any place where they are in plain view, or in any manner which may endanger others (this includes operating a vehicle or machinery after medicating). Colorado medical marijuana patients cannot fill prescriptions at a pharmacy because under federal law, marijuana is classified as a schedule I drug. Instead, patients may get medicine from a recognized caregiver or a non-state-affiliated club or organization, usually called a dispensary. Dispensaries in Colorado offer a range of marijuana strains with different qualities, as well as various \\"edibles\\" or food products that contain marijuana extracts. Certain dispensaries also offer patients seeds and \\"clones\\" for those who want to grow their own medicine. In April 2013, the Colorado Court of Appeals held in Coats v. Dish Network that since marijuana remains against federal law, employers can use that standard rather than state law as a rationale for banning off-the-job worker use, and are not bound by Colorado's Lawful Activities Statute: On June 10, 2016 Governor John Hickenlooper signed House Bill 16-1359. This bill stated that the court shall not prohibit the use or possession of medical marijuana as a condition of probation unless the individual is sentenced to probation for a conviction under Article 43.3 of Title 12, C.R.S.; or if the court determines based upon any material evidence that such a prohibition is necessary and appropriate to accomplish the goals of sentencing stated in 18-1-102.5, C.R.S. =Recreational marijuana (2012)= News report from Voice of America about the business of cannabis in Colorado - published March 20, 2015 Since the enactment of Colorado Amendment 64 in November 2012, adults aged 21 or older can grow up to six marijuana plants (with no more than half being mature flowering plants) privately in a locked space, legally possess all marijuana from the plants they grow (as long as it stays where it was grown),Amendment 64: (3).b legally possess up to one ounce of marijuana while traveling,Amendment 64: (3).a and give as a gift up to one ounce to other citizens 21 years of age or older. Any adult in Colorado's territory may possess up to one ounce of marijuana at any time, regardless of whether they are an in-state resident or an out-of-state visitor, as of 2016. Retail concentrate/edible limits are as follows: 8g of retail concentrate will be equal to 1oz of flower, and therefore 800mg of THC in the form of retail edibles will be equal to 1oz of retail flower.Amendment 64:(3).a, 64:(3).b, and 64:(3).c Consumption is permitted in a manner similar to alcohol, with equivalent offenses prescribed for driving.Amendment 64:(1).b-III and 64:(6).b Consumption in public was recently passed in Denver under Ordinance 300 with a vote of 53% for legal public consumption, and a 46% vote against. Within 60 days the new rules will be written and should be similar to current public alcohol consumption rules and regulations. Amendment 64 also provides for licensing of cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, testing facilities, and retail stores.Amendment 64:(4) Visitors and tourists in Colorado can use and purchase marijuana, but face prosecution if found in possession in any adjacent state. Denver airport has banned all possession of marijuana but admits it has not charged a single person with possession nor has the airport seized any marijuana since the ban went into effect. Governor Hickenlooper signed several bills into law on May 28, 2013 implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on the Implementation of Amendment 64.HB 13-1317 Implement Amendment 64 Majority Recommendation; HB 13-1318 Retail Marijuana Taxes; SB 13-283 Implement Amendment 64 Consensus Recommendations; HB 13-1325 Inferences For Marijuana And Driving Offenses; SB 13-250 Drug Sentencing Changes On September 9, 2013, the Colorado Department of Revenue adopted final regulations for recreational marijuana establishments, implementing the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code (HB 13-1317). On September 16, 2013, the Denver City Council adopted an ordinance for retail marijuana establishments. The state prepared for an influx of tourists with extra police officers posted in Denver. Safety fears led to officials seeking to limit use of the drug in popular ski resorts. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released July 21, 2014, Coloradans continued to support the state's legalization of marijuana for recreational use by a margin of 54‚Äì43 percent. At the same time, the poll indicated 66 percent of voters there think marijuana use should be legal in private homes and in members-only clubs, but should not be legal in bars, clubs or entertainment venues where alcohol is served. Sixty-one percent of respondents also said laws regulating marijuana use should be as strict as laws regulating alcohol use. During 2014, the first year of implementation of Colorado Amendment 64, Colorado's legal marijuana market (both medical and recreational) reached total sales of $700 million. In September 2014, legislation was submitted by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions to ensure that Electronic Benefit Transfer cards could not be used to purchase marijuana, as the United States Department of Health and Human Services stated that their usage in marijuana shops was not prohibited. By April 2018, revenue from legalized marijuana only amounted to 2% of the state's education budget, with some calling it \\"a drop in a bucket.\\" During this month, sales records showed that marijuana sales were flat and were about the same as they were the previous year. In mid-2019, Governor Jared Polis signed a law that would allow licensed businesses to have social marijuana use areas. Regulation General regulations for the legal commercial production and vending of marijuana in the state, which continue to be updated by the General Assembly, are published through the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue. Hemp is defined as any form of the cannabis plant which has less than \\"3/10's of one percent\\" delta-9-THC. The state department of agriculture regulates hemp production. Colorado was one of the first states to legalize marijuana which means they were very careful when outlining how they would regulate it. There are multiple forms of marijuana such as smoking the plant, concentrates and edible making it difficult for Colorado to regulate. The Governors' office worked and is still working hand in hand with individuals involved in law enforcement, public and environmental health, human services, and education to find solutions. Marijuana causes impaired judgment and lack of coordination making it unsafe to drive at certain levels. This is problematic due to the rest of the population being at risk on the roads. Colorado has created legislation that states it is unlawful for one to operate a vehicle when intoxicated at a blood THC level of 5 nanograms/milliliter or more. Colorado put in place legislation stating that only persons 21 and older can possess an ounce of weed or less on hand. = Impaired driving= Like other states, driving while impaired by any drug is illegal in Colorado, though it took the legislature six attempts and three years to pass marijuana intoxication measures. Ultimately the legislators decided on a nanogram limit in the bloodstream, though the number they picked was scoffed at by activists. Today Colorado law states that juries may convict a person of marijuana intoxication if they have five or more nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood, but defendants are allowed to argue that they were not intoxicated despite having such levels of THC in their bloodstream. Testing limitations  Since the legalization of recreational Marijuana in the state of Colorado testing an individual‚Äôs level of intoxication has proven to a challenge. ‚ÄúThere is no one blood or oral fluid concentration that can differentiate impaired and not impaired,‚Äù (Berger, 2018). This is due to body‚Äôs inability to efficiently process tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC. In turn this has led to many individuals being wrongly accused of being under the influence and while they may have tested positive to a drug test the individual may not have consumed the drug for up 30 days prior. As a result the court systems have seen undue hardships of over booking and baseless accusations. This has also proven to be an issue for employers as marijuana is still classified as a schedule 1 narcotic and federally illegal. Employers with zero tolerance policies are finding themselves with fewer applicants that can pass a drug screening and those fail random drug screenings are losing their employment. Better testing needs to be established so those that wish to participate in what is now legal can do so without fear of incarceration or unemployment due to inadequate methods of testing. Results The interior of a cannabis shop in Walsenburg, Colorado. The Colorado amendment 64, which was passed by voters on November 6, 2012, led to legalization in January 2014. Surveys conducted in Colorado in 2016 interviewed over 17,000 students in middle & high school showing that from 2009 to 2015 the rates in which teenagers smoked marijuana has decreased. Colorado has also seen the percentage of teenagers who have smoked marijuana in the past 30 days drop to 21%, from 25%. The annual number of teenager (13 to 21 years old) visits to emergency rooms involving a cannabis related diagnostic code or positive for marijuana from a urine drug screen more than quadrupled during the decade 2005-2014. Two thirds of these cases, were marijuana was involved, were about mental health problems, and more than half of these cases also tested positive for other drugs. The state has also seen car crash claim rates increase after legalization, but there has been no increase in fatalities in comparison with other states. Colorado's youth marijuana use rate dipped after legalization and is lower than the national average. In 2014, Colorado invested $2 million generated from marijuana sales tax revenue on campaigns aimed at anti-marijuana education of minors and the state has plans to spend double that amount, $4 million in 2015 (out of a total projected marijuana sales tax revenue of $125 million). The current campaigns provide information on marijuana laws, the impacts of youth use, the dangers of driving under the influence of any drug, and the harmful side effects of using marijuana. In 2017, the government of Colorado collected over $247 million in taxes, fees, and licensing costs. By 2018, there was $905 million in total recreational cannabis sales since the legalization in 2014. A survey conducted between 2014 and 2016 alleged that adolescent abuse of marijuana has fallen to the lowest level it has been in years after legalization. This has been attributed to both additional funding raised from taxation and law enforcement's increasing involvement in the oversight of production and sales.

The episode is written by executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and newcomer Jim Galasso and directed by Jack Bender. James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford is the character the episode is centered on. In 2007, The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) tasks James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) to recon the Ajira Airways Flight 316 plane and passengers. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) faces an insane Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). In a \\"flash- sideways\\", Detective James Ford's past issues conflict with his present life. The episode received mostly positive reviews, despite it being the lowest- watched episode of the season, with 8.87 million viewers. Plot =2004 (flash-sideways timeline)= James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) is a detective for the LAPD, along with his partner Miles Straume (Ken Leung). He is searching for Anthony Cooper, the man who conned his parents, causing his father to kill his mother and then himself (as seen in \\"Outlaws\\"). He has recently traveled to Australia in his search, telling Miles that he was instead in Palm Springs. Miles arranges for Sawyer to go on a blind date with Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader). The two hit it off rather well. However, after having sex, Charlotte discovers Sawyer's folder containing information on Cooper, leading Sawyer to angrily throw her out. Miles confronts Sawyer the next day for lying about going to Australia and decides to stop being Sawyer's partner. After realizing how lonely he is, Sawyer visits Charlotte, who turns him down. Sawyer decides to open up about his past to Miles, right when a car being driven by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), a fugitive, crashes into his own. He chases her down, leading him to recognize her from their encounter in \\"LA X\\". =2007 (original timeline)= Following the events of the episode \\"Sundown\\", The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) leads the Others he has recruited, along with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and Kate, to rendezvous with his other recruit, Sawyer, who is tending to an injured Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). The Man in Black sends Sawyer on a reconnaissance mission to the smaller Hydra Island to spy on the survivors of Ajira Airways Flight 316. Back at the camp, Claire attempts to kill Kate while Sayid watches impassively, forcing The Man in Black to break up the fight. The Man in Black later explains to Kate that he told Claire the Others took Aaron in order to give Claire something to \\"hold on to\\". He also compares himself to Aaron, stating that his own mother was crazy. Claire later apologizes to Kate and thanks her for taking care of Aaron. On the Hydra Island, Sawyer finds all the passengers dead and encounters a woman named Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who claims to be the only remaining survivor of Flight 316. Sawyer realizes she is lying; a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who has returned on a submarine. Sawyer makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. Sawyer travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating that he is loyal to the Man in Black. Sawyer later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted. Production This episode is the first to be written by Jim Galasso. Reception \\"Recon\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 76 out of 100, indicating \\"Generally Favorable Reviews\\". The score was down on the previous week's score of 92.Dietz, Jason (March 17, 2010), \\"Episode Review: Last Night's Lost, Season 6, Ep. 8: 'Recon'\\", Metacritic. Jeff Jenson of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the episode positively, commenting that although it often seemed to function as a \\"set-up\\" episode, it \\"really worked for [him]\\" due to the return of Sawyer and \\"clever, trickster storytelling where every line seemed to have double meaning and so many scenes seemed pregnant with possibilities for what's really going on.\\" Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star agreed that the episode felt like \\"mid-game strategic stage setting\\", but gave a more negative review than Jensen, deeming Sawyer's off island life \\"pretty clich√© and boring\\" and writing: \\"The really terrible thing about it is that it started off so promising.\\" Sam McPherson of TV Overmind wrote that the episode defied his expectations, but was still less than stellar, preferring the main island storyline to the \\"disjointed\\" off-island plot. McPherson praised the return of Charlotte, opining that Mader gave a \\"fantastic\\" performance, and rated the episode \\"B+\\" overall. He felt that while \\"Recon\\" had weaknesses in the off-island plot, it was still Lost best ever Sawyer- centric episode.

As Australia's most controversial anti-vaccination organisation, it has lobbied against a variety of vaccination-related programs, downplayed the danger of childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis, championed the cause of alleged vaccination victims, and promoted the use of ineffective alternatives such as homeopathy and chiropractic. The vast majority of doctors agree that opposition to vaccination applies to a fringe medical science viewpoint. The group has been described by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) as a provider of ‚Äúmisleading, inaccurate, and deceptive‚Äù vaccination information, and has been heavily criticised by doctors and other experts on immunisation. The group has been called the \\"stronghold of the anti-vaccination movement\\" in Australia and is subject to widespread criticism from medical professionals, scientists and other proponents of vaccination. It has also been criticised for harassing the parents of a victim of vaccine-preventable disease, and for promoting the false idea that shaken baby syndrome is actually vaccine injury. On 14 October 2010, the organisation's right to raise funds was stripped from it by the New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing, stating that its appeals had \\"not been conducted in good faith for charitable purposes\\". In December 2012, the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading issued an order for the group to change its name within two months or be de-registered. The department described the group's name as being \\"misleading and a detriment to the community\\". The group changed its name in February 2014. In July 2018 the group changed its name to Australian Vaccination-risks Network Inc. citing that many in their group \\"did not feel comfortable with having the word 'skeptics' in\\" their name as the reason for the change. The group decided that the word \\"skeptic\\" too closely aligned them with Scientific Skepticism organisations such as the Australian Skeptics. Organisation The Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network was formed in 1994 as the Vaccination Awareness Network by Meryl Dorey, a medically unqualified American who moved to Australia with her Australian husband, saying she got involved after her eldest son was allegedly adversely affected by DPT and MMR vaccines administered when he was a child. The group applied for tax-deductible charity status through the Australian Taxation Office and finally obtained it in 2002; it lost that status in 2007 by allowing it to lapse, and obtained it again in 2009. In 2010 the group's tax-exempt status was revoked by the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing after an audit of the organisation finding that AVN fundraising appeals had not been conducted in good faith for charitable purposes, had been improperly administered and were not in the public interest. In July 2009, the AVN claimed it had more than 3500 members, however in a constitutional change voting proxy form published in March 2010, the AVN revealed the actual membership is considerably lower, at around 1867 financial members. The AVN is headquartered in Bangalow, New South Wales. In February 2010 Dorey announced that she was resigning, but held the position of President until 1 January 2013, when she was replaced by Mr Greg Beattie. Ms Dorey remains with the AVN as \\"Public Officer and spokesperson\\". In addition to its website and associated blog AVN published a quarterly magazine called Informed Voice, later renamed Living Wisdom and offered as a digital publication. Living Wisdom ceased publication in January 2013. The AVN's paid- for memberships formerly included a quarterly insert called Inside Edition which contained \\"12 pages of current news from around the world regarding vaccination\\". =Beliefs= The group is strongly against any form of compulsory vaccination, but Dorey disputes that the group is an anti-vaccine organisation. \\"We don't believe we have the right to tell people whether or not to vaccinate\\", says Dorey who adds, \\"but neither does the government.\\" She says the group is just trying to fill \\"the information void\\" created by a pro- vaccine government and medical community that ignores negative information. Dorey considers herself, \\"pro-information and pro-choice\\". Independent commentators generally reject these claims and point to numerous errors and distortions in AVN's statements about vaccines. Julie Leask from the University of Sydney, challenges AVN's claim that it is not anti-vaccination, by referring to the numerous examples of anti-vaccination rhetoric published by the AVN. In 2009, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation described the AVN as the \\"stronghold of the anti-vaccination movement\\" in Australia. In 2012 the AVN website promoted the anti-vaccination children's book Melanie's Marvelous Measles as well as T-shirts with \\"Love Them, Protect Them, Never Inject Them\\" printed on them. The NSW Northern Rivers region, where the AVN is located, in 2007 had a childhood vaccination rate of only 70% compared to the national average of over 90%. In 2016 a recent National Health Performance Authority report showed the region's average vaccination rate for 5 year olds was reportedly still the lowest in the country at 89.2%. The North Coast Assistant Public Health Director warned \\"Pockets of unvaccinated people in the region was the cause for the rise and fall in whooping cough cases... because we do not have herd immunity to the illness on the Northern Rivers\\". The Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network believes that vaccines contain a variety of toxic ingredients that have no place in the human body. The group argues that these toxins can cause autism, ADHD, brain damage, and cancer, among other serious side effects. In response to medical and scientific research that shows few side effects to most vaccines, Dorey argues that doctors are very hesitant to report adverse reactions and thus the data is highly skewed. These claims are false: while minor side effects such as soreness, swelling, and fever are not uncommon, no large scale scientific study has found evidence of more serious reactions and the purported link to autism is refuted. Former president Meryl Dorey claimed that most doctors are not fully informed about vaccination research and that the medical community as a whole relies on \\"selective evidence\\" to back its argument. She says there is a \\"very, very strong effort\\" by the government and mainstream medical community to suppress any information that may cause parents to question the safety of vaccines. Consequently, Dorey argues, doctors often don't adequately warn patients of potential vaccination risks. Several critics have pointed out that AVN itself is guilty of ignoring evidence not favourable to the anti-vaccination point of view and the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) found that the AVN routinely ignore information that is not favourable to its anti-vaccination position. The HCCC accused the AVN of deceptively removing selected parts of stories when they report on them, and the misrepresentation of the conclusions of reliable studies. Dorey countered that she was not guilty of selective reporting, and that she \\"simply quoted the sections that [she] felt were important\\". In reality, doctors have access to extensive information on vaccine safety and the medical literature includes all known significant potential adverse reactions. The AVN has also questioned the effectiveness of vaccines. While admitting that infection rates dropped dramatically in the twentieth century, they argue that the change is due in large part to improved hygiene and living conditions. Dorey has argued that infection rates were already on the decline before vaccines were invented and that effectiveness has \\"never been scientifically tested.\\" Scientific evidence disputes this opinion by AVsN. Dorey has also stated that the \\"vast majority\\" of people who contract disease have previously been vaccinated. Infectious disease specialist Paul Goldwater acknowledged a few vaccines are not completely effective, but said others were nearly 100% effective. In all cases, he said, \\"the benefits certainly outweigh any risks.\\" The group has also expressed doubts about the cost-benefit ratio and effectiveness of flu vaccines. AVN's arguments are well-known and long debunked anti-vaccine tropes.Kata, A (2012). Anti-vaccine activists, Web 2.0, and the postmodern paradigm--an overview of tactics and tropes used online by the anti-vaccination movement. in Vaccine (journal), Vol.30, 2012. Also cited by UNICEF Dorey has written that \\"passing through a measles infection is sometimes required, for whatever reason, to strengthen some part of a person's vital force\\", and that diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox are benign conditions that do not kill children in industrialized countries. During a studio debate on Channel 7's Sunday Night current affairs program covering the death of a four-week-old baby from whooping cough, Dorey claimed that no one ever dies from the disease, \\"Sunday Night\\" archive footage for \\"Fear and confusion\\" (4 May 2009) and \\"A mother's choice?\\" (26 April 2009) Seven Network TV. Archived at dilutedthinking.com (pt1 , dilutedthinking.com pt2 & dilutedthinking.com amc and described her own children's case of the disease as a \\"storm in a teacup\\" that was easily handled with natural remedies. The NSW Health Care Complaints Commission criticised the AVN's position, saying that it \\"ignores the risks of exposure to, and the adverse effects of childhood illnesses\\". Independent data shows that measles causes the most vaccine-preventable deaths of any disease. It resulted in about 96,000 deaths in 2013. Before immunization in the United States between three and four million cases occurred each year, and the fatality rate is approximately 0.2% of those infected. Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old. Infectious disease specialist Peter McIntyre has accused the group of manipulating research and statistics in order to make its case. \\"It's been a real characteristic of the anti-vaccine movement ... [to claim] to be looking very extensively at the scientific evidence,\\" says McIntyre, \\"[but their conclusions are] really a complete misinterpretation.\\" Paediatrician Chris Ingall says that the AVN's efforts are \\"negative, destructive and [have] no scientific basis.\\" Australian Medical Association SA state president Andrew Lavender states that groups like the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network \\"[act] on very little information and ... [pose] a risk to others.\\" Dorey argues that scientific studies cannot be trusted because they are usually funded, she claims, by biomedicine and pharmaceutical companies that develop and manufacture vaccine products, and that doctors have \\"financial incentives\\" to push vaccines. In fact, paediatricians often lose money on vaccinations. According to The Panic Virus, by Seth Mnookin; then AVN President Meryl Dorey signed a petition claiming \\"that the \\"AIDS industry and the media\\" had tricked the public into believing that the HIV virus causes AIDS\\". When during a government inquiry in 2015, Greens Senator Di Natale asked AVsN why they still referred to themselves as the \\"Australian Vaccination Network\\", a name they have been legally instructed to cease using, AVsN member Brett Smith accused Di Natale of being part of a Murdoch media conspiracy. Journalist Bernard Keane noted this is the first time anyone had suggested a conspiratorial link between The Greens and a media organisation that has been highly critical of the party. In April 2007, Meryl Dorey compared a NSW Health policy change requiring immunisation for its workers to Nazi concentration camps saying \\"these are the sorts of [immunisation] tactics you would expect in concentration camps, not the sort of tactics you would expect in the Australian health-care system.\\" The policy was also opposed by some civil libertarian and health-care groups, but the NSW Nurses' Association noted that \\"vaccinations have always been compulsory for health workers\\" and that the change was only a minimal update to the existing policy. Activism The Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network has regularly spoken out against vaccine-related positions adopted by the Australian government and defended controversial and discredited research. AVN also distributes literature, sponsors seminars, and collects adverse reaction reports. In a 1996 editorial, AVN spoke out against a proposal to add vaccination centres to some shopping centres. Writing on behalf of AVN, Susan Lindberg called the idea \\"downright dangerous,\\" asking \\"what if a baby has a fit or major reaction?\\" She also added that parents are under enough pressure to vaccinate already. In response to a 2002 proposal to extend free vaccination programs, Former AVN president Meryl Dorey argued that the Australian government should first do independent tests of the new vaccines. She said that she had doubts about the accuracy of the existing studies that were \\"funded ... by the pharmaceutical companies.\\" A member of the government's immunisation advisory group countered that they always assess all available scientific data. In August 2004, AVN spoke out against combination vaccines being considered by health authorities. The organisation claimed that there were too many untested variables and that it was irresponsible to keep combining vaccines without knowing the effects. In 2006, Meryl Dorey continued the attack on combined vaccines, claiming it was un-natural, as \\"It is a fact that [humans] will only ever contract one disease at a time.\\" According to the British Medical Journal combined vaccines have actually shown reduced side effects, and it is quite common for humans to suffer simultaneously from several infections. In support of AVN's activism, social scientist Brian Martin wrote Debating vaccination in 2011. In a media release the University of Wollongong stated vaccination \\"should be freely debated\\" and that the 20,000-word paper was \\"intended to assist readers - especially members of the AVN itself\\", in ways to respond to criticism and better understand scientific controversy. Martin is a former member of the AVN. In 2020 the group suggested the deadly coronavirus \\"is just the common cold\\", and people have been \\"fooled\\" by a 'fear campaign on the silly sheep media\\". Dorey questioned the COVID-19 pandemic saying: \\"Are you being lied to?\\" Requesting that followers \\"take your phones and pop into the local hospital\\" and \\"Let us know how crowded it is ‚Äî or is not. Is coronavirus really overwhelming our nation or is our nation overwhelming us with lies and killing our economy and us?\\" =Adverse reaction reports= In December 1996, AVN presented Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge with reports on 150 cases of children claimed to have been injured by vaccines that dated back to 1991; Dorey claimed that the collection of previously unreported reactions represented the largest single collection ever presented to the Australian Government. Dorey states that many of the parents involved had previously tried to have their cases looked at, but had been told by health authorities their cases couldn't proceed because the parents lacked necessary documentation. Gavin Frost, a government vaccination adviser, said he supported increased medical reporting of vaccine side effects but doubted claims of permanent damage caused by vaccines. A published government report shows that over the 33-month period from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2002, the AVN made a total of 11 unspecified adverse event reports, which equates to approximately one report every three months. In July 2010, the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission criticised the AVN's adverse event reporting system as being \\"anecdotal and misleading\\". =Views on vaccination incentives= In 1997 Susan Lindberg spoke on behalf of AVN opposing the announcement of a government plan to cut child care and maternity payments to parents who didn't vaccinate their children and to give incentive payments to doctors to give vaccines; she also called for creation of a vaccine registry and adverse event reporting system to be created. In May 2000, Meryl Dorey spoke out against cuts in child care payments for 9000 families who failed to get their children vaccinated. She called the legislation a type of \\"civil conscription\\" and said the program was likely in violation of the Constitution. Wooldridge responded that the claim was \\"nonsense\\" because the requirement was \\"simply a condition on government financial assistance\\" and that families had the choice to accept it or not. In July 2007, AVN spoke out against the government's practice of giving pediatricians bonus incentives for immunising their patients. Dorey argued that the practice was unethical and led to doctors making decisions based on their pocket book rather than their conscience. She would later liken the payment to a bribe noting that doctors aren't paid extra for prescribing antibiotics, for example. Dorey further argued that the government began the practice in order to meet World Health Organization mandates on vaccination percentages and thus was more interested in playing a numbers game rather than doing what was right for the nation's children. The payment was discontinued in October 2008. The NSW Health Care Complaints Commission criticised the AVN for casting medical practitioners in a negative light as \\"unethical and untrustworthy without providing any cogent reasons or evidence for making such an assertion\\". =Defense of Andrew Wakefield= In February 2004, AVN defended Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study that suggested a possible link between autism and MMR vaccinations, implying that Wakefield had been treated unfairly and that he lost his job for \\"[refusing] to lie.\\" Less than a month later, ten of the twelve scientists associated with the study retracted their conclusions. In February 2010, The Lancet formally retracted Wakefield's original 1998 article following an independent investigation that concluded Wakefield had been \\"dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a 'callous disregard' for the suffering of children involved in his research\\". On 24 May 2010, immediately following the striking-off of Mr. Wakefield by the British General Medical Council for \\"gross misconduct\\" and \\"bringing the medical profession into disrepute\\", the AVN continued to support him, issuing the following statement: \\"Dr Wakefield knows that he has the love and respect of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of parents around the world. Whether or not the GMC which is stacked with corrupt influences strikes him off is of no consequence. He will continue his work and autistic families everywhere will benefit as a result.\\" In a statement following the ruling, Wakefield said \\"I never made the claim at the time, nor do I still make the claim that MMR is a cause of autism.\\" =Actions against the Australian Measles Control Campaign= Prior to the commencement of the 1998 Australian Measles Control Campaign, the AVN initiated a campaign against it, for example accusing the Federal Government of using bullying tactics, overstating the effectiveness of the vaccine and understating the potential side effects. In July AVN said that they were instigating a Federal Court injunction against the campaign, to try to force it to change the information booklet and to simplify the forms required to obtain an exemption. The AVN's statements prompted the Federal Minister for Health to describe the group as \\"deceitful crackpots\\", while the results of the campaign showed there were just 89 adverse reactions, and that the campaign resulted in a large increase of measles and rubella immunity levels. Available via Internet Archive of Australia Department of Health webpage At a Perth anti-vaccination seminar on 1 June 2010, Dorey was critical of the government's introduction of the measles vaccine to Australia in 1970, saying \\"We introduced a vaccine for a disease which was killing almost nobody and one has to ask, why?\\" Mortality data shows that during the decade 1966 to 1975, there were 146 certified deaths from measles in Australia while in the decade 1996 to 2005, there were zero deaths directly attributed to measles, and one death due to the measles complication SSPE. The decline in mortality is attributed to Australia's high measles vaccination rates achieving the elimination of endemic measles transmission in Australia. In 2014 Australia was declared by the WHO as having eliminated local strains of measles. But as of 2015/16 deadly measles cases had returned to Australia. =Campaign against the meningococcal vaccine= The AVN campaigned against the introduction of a meningococcal vaccine to Australia in 2002. Meryl Dorey accused the government of wasting 41 million on the vaccination program, claimed that the vaccine had shown a large number of adverse reactions in the United Kingdom and had never been tested for effectiveness. However the vice-president of the AMA, Trevor Mudge, refuted her claims, pointing out that meningococcal disease is extremely dangerous and that \\"Vaccination really is the only strategy for this condition that is likely to work\\". He said the vaccine had been extensively tested and contrary to Dorey's claims had been found to be safe and highly effective in the UK. During an online debate covering meningococcal vaccination in 2005, Australian infectious disease specialist Peter McIntyre warned parents \\"not to be fooled by the limited and biased information from [the] AVN website.\\" The rate of invasive meningococcal disease in Australia fell by more than 60% between 2002 (when vaccination commenced) and 2009, after doubling during the previous decade. Mortality data from the UK shows that meningococcal deaths decreased from 67 to 5 in the two years following implementation of the vaccine. The NSW HCCC criticised the AVN for selectively using information to support its position, when there is no evidence to support their claims, and that the evidence suggests that the most effective meningococcal strategy is to widely vaccinate. =Campaign against the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine= Following the death of four-week-old Dana McCaffery from pertussis (whooping cough) in March 2009, and the subsequent government campaigns to improve pertussis immunisation, the AVN launched a campaign against the pertussis vaccine, using the death of the child in the campaign materials, claiming that the she did not die from pertussis. The AVN's public campaign against the pertussis vaccine began with an article in the May 2009 issue of Living Wisdom written by Meryl Dorey, which questioned the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the dangers of whooping cough itself. Critics pointed out that Dorey's article contained numerous errors of fact and omission. While the article correctly stated that Sweden had previously withdrawn pertussis vaccination in 1979 due to research showing it was ineffective, she failed to reveal that the vaccine then used in Sweden was different to the effective vaccine used in other countries such as Australia, nor did she reveal that Sweden reintroduced pertussis vaccination in 1996 and this had resulted in huge incidence reduction, with cases falling by 80-90% within 3 years. In the article, Dorey claims that \\"Whooping Cough is not a vaccine-preventable disease\\". Critics point out that evidence has shown that the acellular vaccine is 84% efficacious, and prevents 99.8% of infant hospital admissions after a completing a full course of three doses of the vaccine. Their campaign against the vaccine continued during two Channel 7 Sunday Night television programs, where Dorey made the claim that \\"no-one ever dies of Whooping Cough\\". During the debates, the facts surrounding the death of Dana McCaffery from whooping cough were disputed by Dorey and other AVN members, and it was alleged that the infant's parents had received hatemail from AVN supporters for their public pro-vaccination stance following the death of their daughter. The filming of this program was the catalyst for the formation of the Stop the AVN group. AVN members continued to harass the McCafferys through to July 2010 by sending emails, letters and AVN brochures to the family. Former AVN president Meryl Dorey wrote another blog disputing the McCafferys' version of events, the treatments and effects Dana suffered and the diagnosis of pertussis. Dana's mother attempted to get the government intervene, to stop the harassment. In a subsequent television interview for ABC Lateline, Dorey admitted she had accused the McCafferys of \\"turning their daughter into a martyr because she supposedly died of whooping cough\\". In 2012 the AVN continued to target the McCafferys. AVN member and University of Wollongong researcher Judy Wilyman was published on AVN's website accusing the State Government of using the imagery of four-week-old Dana's death to push the vaccine stating it was the \\"Government and the media who have been using the McCafferys to promote a vaccine\\". She also questioned whether the McCafferys had been paid to promote the whooping cough vaccine. The McCaffery family vigorously denied these claims. In March 2016 Wilyman continued to repeat that such child deaths are \\"anecdotal\\" and provoke the parents of the deceased children saying they are \\"promoting the death of their child to whooping cough, and lobby groups ... have provided awards to these parents for their efforts [and] they receive financial rewards from pro-vaccine lobby groups for their efforts\\". =Campaign against the swine flu vaccine= In September 2009, AVN campaigned against the swine flu vaccine, calling it \\"madness\\" to use a vaccine which they claimed was \\"laden with toxic mercury.\\" Dorey further argued that more testing was needed on the vaccine before it was offered to the public and that it could prove to be more dangerous than the flu itself. She told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the swine flu should be treated no differently from the seasonal flu and that the government was wasting money by spending over a hundred million dollars on the vaccine. Dorey's claims were rejected by the Australian Medical Association and other medical experts. =Anti-vaccination seminars and public talks= In May 2010 the AVN announced that they would be hosting a seminar in Perth, Western Australia, to be held at the Uniting Church In The City (UCIC) on 14 May. However following a campaign by members of the Church, the medical community and members of the Stop the AVN group, the Church announced that they would not allow the AVN to use their premises for the seminar, as they were \\"concerned that there may be a public perception that the UCIC does not support childhood vaccinations due to the AVN seminar being held at UCIC's rooms\\". The AVN rescheduled and relocated the event for 1 June at the State Library of WA. The decision by the Library to allow the AVN to use their premises was widely criticised by the medical community and politicians, with the president of the Australian Medical Association saying he \\"was worried the use of the venue could give the group credibility\\" and the Shadow Arts Minister, John Hyde, saying \\"Why should a group that endangers the lives of WA children be allowed to speak and promote their cause at a taxpayer-funded venue dedicated to learning?\\" Two days after the event, Fiona Stanley AC was interviewed by Perth Radio about the seminar, describing the views presented by the AVN as \\"bizarre\\", and \\"so misinformed that it is scary\\". In Dec 2011, organisers of the Woodford Folk Festival were criticised for inviting Meryl Dorey to speak. The Queensland Health Minister Geoff Wilson advised attendees \\"not to take [Dorey's] nonsense too seriously\\". The Australian Medical Association described the group's views as \\"dangerous\\", and said organisers \\"had a responsibility to add speakers who could provide the medically approved side of the argument\\" so the audience were aware of \\"the risk of the information being presented [by Dorey]\\". Community pressure intensified resulting in Andreas Suhrbier, head of the immunovirology laboratory at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, to appear and field questions from the audience. =Objection to \\"No Jab No Pay/Play\\"= AVN have promoted the Church of Conscious Living, described in the Sydney Morning Herald as a \\"fake\\", and in the Telegraph as a \\"sham\\" church set up to provide spurious religious exemptions from vaccination. The NSW Health Minister said she was \\"alarmed that a 'religion' would be created to thwart an important public health initiative.\\" In April 2015 the \\"no jab, no pay\\" policy was introduced and the Abbott Federal Government made it more difficult for people to object to vaccination on religious grounds, and required that religions register their objection to vaccination. The policy officially came into effect in January 2016 and reportedly \\"sparked a rush on vaccines as parents fear missing out\\" on Family Tax Benefit Part A supplement and childcare subsidies. AVsN president Tasha David and former president Meryl Dorey both appeared on an \\"expert panel\\" at a February 2016 anti vaccine event in Mullumbimby (which has the lowest vaccination rates in Australia) at which other ways of evading no jab no play/pay rules were discussed, including falsely claiming \\"hypersensitivity\\" to gelatin or yeast, in order to obtain medical exemption. It was reported in The Daily Telegraph that Tasha David and Meryl Dorey were at the event to \\"prove that Australia was a testing ground for the rest of the world\\". In March 2016 the AVsN announced its intention to legally challenge the Federal 'no jab no pay' laws, with the return of spokesperson Meryl Dorey stating \\"[w]hat the government is doing is unconstitutional, immoral and illegal, and they need to be shown the error of their ways\\". In one announcement AVsN falsely stated that Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the National Centre for Immunisation Research & Surveillance also opposed the 'No Jab No Pay' legislation. Both organisations promptly rejected AVsN's claim and clarified they supported the legislation. By December AVsN had raised AUD$152,000 toward the legal challenge, then on Christmas Day announced it was dropping the legal action, citing a \\"poor chance of success\\". Complaints, investigations and criticisms The AVN has been the subject of several complaints to (and investigations by) Government departments and medical authorities. Medical professionals, scientists and other proponents of vaccination are highly critical of the AVN. =NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC)= In August 2009, Ken McLeod filed a complaint against AVN with the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission. The complaint, which was supported by the group Australian Skeptics, said that the organisation was in breach of the Health Care Complaints Act because it made \\"unsubstantiated health claims based on 'conspiracy theories', pseudo-scientific evidence and debunked research.\\" The complaint was also supported by Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith. In response to the complaint, the AVN submitted a 27-page document which argued that they are not actively providing health care service and therefore are not under the jurisdiction of the Health Care Complaints Commission. Dorey called the complaint vexatious and a nuisance tactic. Tom Sidwell, a Monash University Immunology student, conducted a review of the sources and information provided in the AVN's HCCC reply. He submitted to the HCCC that all of the sources quoted by Dorey in the reply were either not from peer- reviewed journals as Dorey had claimed, or did not actually support the conclusions she was attributing to them. In an article published in the Journal of the Australian Skeptics, Sidwell wrote: :\\"The collection of references is, on the whole, laughable. At best she hasn't read the papers she cites and includes them out of ignorance, and at worst she is being deliberately deceptive.\\" HCCC ruling The HCCC concluded their investigation into the AVN in July 2010. The Commission determined that \\"the health education service provided by the Australian Vaccination Network on its website provides misleading and inaccurate information on the subject of vaccination\\". In addition, the Commission found that the AVN \\"misleads readers by using reliable and peer-reviewed research, but quoting selectively from it, often in contradiction to the conclusions or findings of the studies themselves\\". The Commission ordered the AVN to permanently place the following information in a prominent place on their website within 14 days: * The Australian Vaccination Network's purpose is to provide information against vaccination in order to balance what it believes is the substantial amount of pro-vaccination information available elsewhere; * The information provided should not be read as medical advice; and * The decision about whether or not to vaccinate should be made in consultation with a health care provider. Following the AVN's refusal to display the notice, on 26 July 2010 the HCCC issued a public warning about the group stating : \\"The AVN's failure to include a notice on its website of the nature recommended by the Commission may result in members of the public making improperly informed decisions about whether or not to vaccinate, and therefore poses a risk to public health and safety.\\" The NSW HCCC's ruling was further supported by the Chief Medical Officer of Victoria, who agreed that the AVN \\"should make it clear what their views are and if it's an extreme view about a certain topic it should be clear that it is their view and that they're not speaking on behalf of for example the medical profession\\". Supreme Court appeal The AVN appealed the HCCC ruling to the NSW Supreme Court, arguing that the HCCC does not have jurisdiction over Meryl Dorey or the AVN. In February 2012, the court ruled that the AVN is a health care provider, and therefore the HCCC does have jurisdiction over their activities. However, it ruled that the original complaints to the HCCC about the AVN were invalid because the complaints did not include evidence that anyone had actually acted on the incorrect advice provided by the AVN. The court did not make a judgement about the validity of the complaints, nor the information contained within them. Changes to HCCC Act and new investigation The ruling resulted in a change in the law, allowing HCCC to initiate proceedings based on likelihood of harm, rather than having to wait for actual injury. Following the passage of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 by the Parliament of New South Wales, giving the HCCC powers to initiate investigations, and explore medical advice provided more generally than under the previous act, the NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that the Health Minister has advised NSW Parliament the Health Care Complaints Commission is launching an investigation into the Australian Vaccination Network. The HCCC concluded a second investigation into AVN in 2014 and published a new warning statement. The second public warning went further by scientifically addressing specific medical misinformation disseminated by AVN and concluded: :\\"The Commission has established that AVN does not provide reliable information in relation to certain vaccines and vaccination more generally... AVN‚Äôs dissemination of misleading, misrepresented and incorrect information about vaccination engenders fear and alarm and is likely to detrimentally affect the clinical management or care of its readers... the Commission urges general caution is exercised when using AVN‚Äôs website or Facebook page to research vaccination and to consult other reliable sources, including speaking to a medical practitioner, to make an informed decision\\". =NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing (OLGR) investigation= Following complaints that the AVN had been illegally fundraising without authority between 2 July 2007 and 2 June 2009, and a previous warning relating to the AVN being in breach of its fundraising authority conditions (as it did not have a \\"mechanism to properly and effectively deal with complaints relating to fundraising\\"), the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing (OLGR) announced in February 2010 that they would conduct a full audit of the groups fundraising activities. OLGR Ruling On 4 August 2010, the OLGR announced that their audit of the AVN had \\"detected a number of breaches of charity fund-raising laws\\", including: * Fundraising without authority; * Unauthorised expenditure; * Failure to keep proper records of income and expenditure; * Possible breaches of the Charitable Trust Act, 1993, which would be referred to the Department of Justice and the Attorney General. The AVN was given 28 days to respond to the findings. President Meryl Dorey declined to comment on the issue. =Revocation of authority to fundraise= Public notice. Revocation of A.V.N. Inc's authority to fundraise under Charitable Fundraising Act. NSW State Gazette No.41, 2010, p 5253. On 14 October 2010, the Hon. Kevin Greene, M.P. revoked the AVN's authority to fundraise, meaning they are no longer permitted to conduct appeals or receive donations from members of the public. Reasons for the revocation were given as breaches of sections 31 (1) a, b and f of the Charitable Fundraising Act 1991: * Their fundraising appeals have not been conducted in good faith for charitable purposes; * Their fundraising appeals have been improperly administered; * Their fundraising activities are not in the public interest. In response to the revocation, the AVN issued a media release criticising the OLGR's decision as being politically motivated, and difficult to understand given that the \\"revocation was based entirely upon the questionable decision by the HCCC\\", rather than upon \\"the simple errors\\" detected by the OLGR during their audit of the organisation. Dorey appealed for the public to make donations to the AVN before the revocation took effect on 20 October 2010. =Supreme Court appeal= As part of their appeal to the NSW Supreme Court in relation to the HCCC complaint, the AVN asked the court to invalidate the OLGR's revocation of their fundraising authority, asking them to grant certiorari. In February 2012, the Court rejected AVN's argument, dismissed this particular complaint, and the fundraising prohibition remained. = NSW Office of Fair Trading name change order = In December 2012, the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading issued an order for the AVN to change its name within two months or be de-registered. The letter of action was delivered to the home of the organization's president, Meryl Dorey. It described the name as misleading and a detriment to the community. The Fair Trading Minister, Anthony Roberts, said that issue of vaccination was one of life and death and that the organization's activities endangered people's safety. Mr Roberts has warned other states against the AVN trying to register. Robert Vellar, the NSW Fair Trading Assistant Commissioner for Compliance and Enforcement, says the AVN's name has misled parents seeking information. Mr Vellar added that the NSW government intended to change definitions in the Associations Act to prevent groups from using names that were in conflict with their charter. The president of the AMA (NSW), Assoc Prof Brian Owler, said the AVN needed to take responsibility for information it gave to parents. The AVN is fighting the renaming order in the courts. This order was challenged by the group. The challenge was dismissed, and on 25 November 2013 the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading order was upheld by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. In February 2014 the group changed its name to the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network. = Comparison of vaccination to rape = In April 2015 the AVsN Facebook page drew international attention for publishing a simulated rape photo ad with text saying that vaccinations are \\"forced penetration\\" and asking \\"do you really 'need' control over your own body?\\" It drew criticism from the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria, the Federal shadow Minister for Health Catherine King MP, the Federal Minister for Health Sussan Ley MP, the president of the AMA, the NSW Rape Crisis Centre, as well as supporters of the group. Catherine King MP said that \\"equating doctors with rapists shows how completely unhinged the AVsN has become\\". AVsN responded: \\"This post isn't tasteless - it is honest. What truly IS tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we don't believe it is best for their health\\". President of the AVsN, Tasha David, claimed her organisation did not own or control the page. Within days the Facebook group was reported as having been shut down. It was not the first time AVN had allegedly used vaccination-rape comparison, in 2011 it tweeted \\"court orders rape of a child\\" in relation to a court ordering a five- year-old girl to be vaccinated. = Other controversies = In March 2007, the AVN made certain erroneous comments on their website, including claims that the Australian Medical Association(AMA) received funding from pharmaceutical companies and actively censored information provided to its members. These claims were factually incorrect, and the AMA took legal action against the AVN. The AVN withdrew the claims and issued a public apology on 21 March 2007. In 2011, the Australian Vaccination Network's advice against vaccination, and their refusal to display the HCCC safety warning on their website, was included in Australian Doctor magazine's Top 50 Medical Scandals of the past 50 years. 2009 winners: Meryl Dorey & The Australian (anti)Vaccination Network The Australian Skeptics awarded their Bent Spoon Award, \\"presented annually to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle\\", to Meryl Dorey and the AVN in 2009, stating that the award had been earned through their \\"scaremongering and misinformation about childhood vaccination\\". In response, Dorey stated that winning the award meant she was \\"on the right track\\". In September 2010, the AVN was accused of numerous copyright breaches relating to their sale of information packs containing photocopies of selected parts of old medical journal articles, newspaper reports and cartoons. After receiving complaints from authors and copyright holders, the AVN withdrew the packs from sale on their website. Several authors stated that they had not given permission for the AVN to reproduce the material and would seek payment for their past use. They also criticised the AVN's use of the articles as they were \\"old and not based on current information\\". =Political criticisms= Federal Parliament Following the AVN's public objections to the Australian Government's 1998 Australian Measles Control Campaign, the then Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge issued a media release which was highly critical of the group, writing: :\\"I am deeply concerned that media organisations risk giving credibility to the crackpot views of the AVN by publishing, without question, their untrue and deceitful claims. Ultimately, young children who are particularly vulnerable to measles could suffer if their parents were influenced by the anti-science, irrational views of the AVN.\\" In 2013, Greens Senator Richard Di Natale put forward a motion calling for the Australian Vaccination Network to be disbanded, citing the risks that low-levels of vaccination posed to the health of children in Australia. The motion was passed by the Australian Senate. Senator Di Natale condemned the organisation, stating in a press release: :\\"The AVN have gone so far as to promote measles as a healthy gift from mother nature and not the deadly disease it really is. As a doctor, I saw first-hand the tragedy these easily preventable diseases can cause. :Today the Senate has joined with the public health community to send a clear and strong message to those who are peddling lies about vaccines ‚Äì they should pack up and go home.\\" NSW Parliament In a response to a parliamentary question about the AVN's statements regarding the MMR vaccine, in September 2012 the NSW Minister for Health and Minister for Medical Research said: : \\"The Australian Vaccination Network has not provided accurate information to parents about the risks and benefits of immunisation. Any link between the measles vaccine and autism has been conclusively discredited by numerous studies and reviews by credible experts, including the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Paediatrics and the UK Medical Research Council.\\" During the NSW parliamentary debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, the NSW shadow Health minister Andrew McDonald warned that the AVN's name and website were \\"designed to mislead unsuspecting community members to believe that a balanced view about immunisation is being presented\\" and that \\"When provoked, Australian Vaccination Network's fellow travellers can and do behave reprehensibly,\\" while Mr Matt Kean MP described the AVN as \\"a group of flat-earthers and wing-nuts who believe that vaccination is unnecessary. Indeed, the group has claimed that vaccination is harmful to individuals, which is contrary to all the scientific evidence.\\" In further debate, members of parliament described the AVN as \\"placing children at risk\\", \\"negligent\\", \\"misleading\\" and \\"disreputable\\". The late NSW Greens MLC John Kaye lobbied against, what he called, AVN's \\"voodoo claims and conspiracy theories\\". Describing AVN as \\"disgraceful\\", he said: \\"Spreading misinformation about childhood immunisation could be deadly\\". In the NSW Legislative Council, the Hon. Peter Phelps described the AVN as \\"insane\\", while the Hon. Trevor Khan called the AVN a \\"danger to public health\\" for \\"touting unscientific propaganda\\". The Hon. Anthony John Roberts, NSW Minister for Fair Trading said that \\"It is incredibly irresponsible for an avowedly anti-vaccination group to advertise itself as a balanced source of information on vaccination. Such action is not only misleading to the public but also dangerous to those who believe they are referring to evidence-based medical advice...\\" The Government, the medical community and the Australian Medical Association led by Associate Professor Brian Owler are in agreement that the name Australian Vaccination Network \\"is unacceptable\\". Queensland Parliament In December 2011 the Queensland Minister for Health, Geoff Wilson, issued a media statement criticising the AVN with the following comment, \\"For the small number of people who might be entertained by what Ms Dorey has to say, Woodford Folk Festival has a place for everyone. Just don't take her nonsense too seriously.\\" The Hon. Geoff Wilson also added, \\"The fact is vaccinations have saved millions of lives. Their invention was a miracle of scientific achievement.\\" =Other criticisms= In 2002 while speaking about low vaccination rates in the NSW Northern Rivers region, the Hon. Brian Pezzutti criticised Meryl Dorey in the NSW Legislative Council: :\\"only 60 per cent of children in the Byron Bay area in the 12 to 15 month age group‚Äîthe very young and most vulnerable‚Äî are immunised. That is mainly because of the activities of a woman called Meryl Dorey, who lives in Byron Bay and who has decided not to immunise her children and who regularly claims that immunisation is not necessary. She campaigns against immunisation.\\" Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith, who had previously run a national ad in The Australian asking parents to ignore AVN's claims, has been highly critical of the organisation, stating: : \\"They are actually anti-vaccination, and they should put on every bit of their material that they are anti-vaccination in great big words. They have every right for that belief but they should communicate it clearly so people are not misled.\\" and : \\"I think they're choosing not to vaccinate because they don't understand risk management - they are told that there is a risk with vaccination - now everything in life has a risk. There's a minute risk but it's been proved all over the world that the advantages far outweigh the risk.\\" Following the AVN's decision to hold an anti-vaccination seminar at the Western Australian State Library, the Shadow Arts Minister John Hyde criticised the state Government for allowing the group to \\"push its anti-vaccine message\\", saying: : \\"Why should a group that endangers the lives of WA children be allowed to speak and promote their cause at a taxpayer-funded venue dedicated to learning? Their dangerous propaganda which is putting children at risk of polio, smallpox, cholera and other preventable diseases should not be able to gain respectability by using the good name of the State Library.\\" During an interview on ABC Lateline in July 2010, the 1997 Australian of the Year and 1996 Nobel Prize for Medicine laureate, immunologist Peter C. Doherty described the AVN's attempts to reduce the child immunisation rate as a \\"Crime against Humanity\\". In a 2016 press release responding to questions from AVsN's Meryl Dorey, the Australian Sex Party publicly stated: :\\"The safety and efficacy of vaccination is not an area of scientific controversy. The claim that governments and scientists are all conspiring to mislead us ... is absurd and irresponsible... The claims of the anti-vaccination movement have been thoroughly debunked. Choosing not to vaccinate your children amounts to medical neglect; this is a serious ethical issue... We at the Australian Sex Party would like to encourage parents who are questioning what‚Äôs right for their children, to follow the advice of the scientific and medical communities, rather than charlatans and conspiracy theorists\\". =Stop the Australian Vaccination Network group= In May 2009, immediately after the filming of the second Sunday Night television program covering the Pertussis death of Dana McCaffery, the Stop the AVN group was formed by Daniel Raffaele to \\"challenge the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN)\\". Members of the group began investigating the information provided by the AVN, and submitted complaints to the HCCC and OLGR. The AVN's Meryl Dorey accused the group of \\"attacking the AVN unfairly\\". In November 2010, the Australian Skeptics collectively presented the 2700 members of the SAVN group with the Skeptic of the Year award, and SAVN members Ken McLeod and Wendy Wilkinson with the Thornett Award For the Promotion Of Reason. =American Airlines cancels an AVN advertisement= In April 2012, American Airlines pulled an AVN ad that was scheduled to appear on American Airlines' in-flight TV channel. Dorey stated that \\"We were offered a three minute slot, but because of the controversy from 'Stop the AVN' we lost it.\\" Founder of the 'Stop the AVN' group, Daniel Raffaele, who initiated the campaign to stop the ad commented, \\"Basically when it comes to information the AVN provides misinformation.\\" =Therapeutic Goods Administration complaint= The AVN has been the subject of a complaint over the advertising of black salve, and the complaint was found to be justified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration's Complaints Resolution Panel. The Panel's determination was issued on 3 December 2012. On 16 May 2013, the delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing decided to order the AVN to carry out actions as the AVN had not fully complied with the Panel's determination. Dorey and Leon Pittard (of Fair Dinkum Radio) have been the subject of an additional complaint, which was also found to be justified. Dorey has presented a Freeman on the land defence in relation to that complaint.

The optical advantage of hammer paint is that surfaces look acceptable even if the underlying surface is not flat and smooth. To get a regular paint to look smooth, the surface would have to be prepared first, for example, by spackling, sanding, grinding or polishing. With hammer paint, this step can be omitted.

The reasons for keeping chickens are as pets, for eggs, for meat, or for eating pests. Some people will sell the eggs for side income. Keeping chickens in an urban environment is a type of urban agriculture, important in the local food movement, which is the growing practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in or around a village, town or city.Bailkey, M. and J. Nasr. 2000. From Brownfields to Greenfields: Producing Food in North American Cities. Community Food Security News. Fall 1999/Winter 2000:6 According to National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service and experts in backyard agriculture, there are a host of personal benefits associated with urban agriculture and keeping chickens in one's own backyard. History Keeping livestock in cities has been common throughout history and is still practiced in many parts of the world. For example, 50,000 pigs were being kept in Manhattan in 1859. But local ordinances were created to limit this, owing to the noise and smell nuisance, and these were relaxed only in times of war when the urban populace was encouraged to provide food for itself. Urban relief gardens played an important role in sustaining large populations of Americans during economic depressions.landarch.rutgers.edu/fac_staff/Laura_Lawson/assets/pdf/UGPlecture.pdf War gardens played an important role in the nationwide effort to help win both World War I and World War II. These victory gardens made gardening a patriotic activity and introduced gardening as an activity for everyone, not just those too poor to buy their own food. Later, in the late 1960s and 1970s, community gardening started to make a comeback as a hobby. Organic gardening, urban animal husbandry, and community farms became popular and many cities around the country started community gardening programs for their residents. Revival In Canada and the United States, the raising of chickens on urban, suburban, and small town residential lots has become increasingly popular. For example, in Madison, Wisconsin, citizens formed a group called the Chicken Underground, overturned a ban upon domestic chickens and there are now 81 registered owners. A film titled Mad City Chickens was made about their campaign. More and more cities that had previously banned urban chickens are removing old regulations or making permits easier to obtain. Policies toward keeping chickens vary by country, county, or city. Other cities with urban chicken programs and activists include Halifax, New York City, Portland, Oregon, Seattle and Vancouver. In the UK, the keeping of chickens has also grown in popularity with as many as 200,000 households involved. Sales of the fashionable Eglu hen house increased ten-fold between 2004 and 2009. Commercial vs. backyard egg production Commercial egg production has been associated with salmonella and other disease outbreaks in the United States.Jones FT, Rives DV, Carey JB. Salmonella contamination in commercial eggs and an egg production facility. Poult Sci. 1995 Apr;74(4):753-7. Poor sanitation and crowded hen houses have contributed to these problems. Expansion of the poultry industry, fueled by an increased demand for poultry products,Diseases of Poultry. Y.M. Saif. Wiley-Blackwell Publishing, 2003. Pages 732-733. has created a demand for high throughout poultry and egg production. The resulting increased poultry population density and the rearing of incompatible poultry species in close proximity have presented major disease challenges. Studies have shown that small scale, backyard chicken keeping/egg production reduces these potential disease risks.Holt PS, Davies RH, Dewulf J, Gast RK, Huwe JK, Jones DR, Waltman D, Willian KR.. The impact of different housing systems on egg safety and quality. Poult Sci. 2011 Jan;90(1):251-62 According to Mench et al.,J. A. Mench, D. A. Sumner and J. T. Rosen-Molina. Sustainability of egg production in the United States‚ÄîThe policy and market context. Poult Sci 2011. 90:229-240. although changes in commercial egg production systems are being driven largely by animal welfare concerns, it is clear that other aspects of such changes must be considered to ensure sustainable egg production. Sustainability is a complex topic. Elements of sustainability include economics, environmental effects, human health and safety, and social values in addition to animal welfare. Backyard egg production has been suggested as a solution to sustainable, healthy food supply for families.D. A. Sumner, H. Gow, D. Hayes, W. Matthews, B. Norwood, J. T. Rosen-Molina and W. Thurman. Economic and market issues on the sustainability of egg production in the United States: Analysis of alternative production systems.  Breeds  While there are over 300 different breeds of chickens, most people choose between a select few breeds. Most chicken owners are looking for a high-producing egg layer, cold- and heat-hardy, docile, quiet, non-broody, and aesthetically pleasing chicken breed. Many commercial chickens raised in factories for white eggs are white leghorns. This breed is noisy, but has a very high production of eggs and rarely go broody, and they are not very docile, cold-hardy or aesthetically pleasing. Urban chicken owners often choose a red-sex link hybrid similar to production brown-egg producers (Isa Browns, HyLine Browns), another hybrid among the Red and Black Sex-links, or chickens known as \\"heritage breeds,\\" including the Rhode Island Red, Barred Rocks, Buff Orpingtons, Brahmas, Wyandottes, etc. These breeds generally fit more of the categories that urban chicken owners are looking for. Meat chickens are different than egg-laying chickens for urban chicken owners. Chicks sold specifically as meat chickens are sometimes called broiler chickens. As with egg-laying breeds, there is a variety of meat chicken breeds. These chickens are butcher-ready in a short time period after hatching. Some breeds grow to full size in as little as 5 weeks. Other breeds grow for up to 12‚Äì14 weeks until the butcher date. Meat chickens provide urban chicken owners the ability to know where their meat is coming from, and how it was raised. Egg-laying chickens include the two groups, Bantams and Standards. Often raised as pets, Bantams are the smaller variety of chickens that require less space and feed. These smaller chickens provide smaller eggs, but still produce a large quantity of eggs. Standards range from heavy to light breeds and produce the average sized eggs.  Chick care  = Purchasing chickens = Chicken owners need to find a place to purchase chickens. Oftentimes, people purchase chickens at local feed stores, or through a hatchery. = Creating a brooder = Chickens not being raised by a mother hen need assistance from their owner to survive. Chickens are raised in a brooder, which can look like a variety of things. Many individuals create their own brooder out of cardboard, plastic or wood. Different sources identify a variety of different square feet per bird needed, but a rule of thumb can be two square feet per chicken. This number can be lowered when the chick is young, but as they grow they will need at least two square feet per bird. It is important that chicken owners place their brooder in a draft-free place, yet still allow holes in the brooder for ventilation. = Heating and bedding = Chicks require a warm environment. In a brooder, this warm environment is created artificially with a heat lamp. My Pet Chicken recommends a red heat lamp, because a white heat lamp can create a harsh and uncomfortable environment for the baby chicks. During the first week of the chicks' life, a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit is required. The temperature can be decreased by 5 degrees F. each week of the chicks life, until they reach week 6. At week 6, the birds should have enough feathers grown to be moved into their chicken coop. Checking on chicks often is important, as chicks that are too cold will huddle together to attempt to retain warmth, and chicks that are too hot will spread out in the brooder in attempts to cool down. Temperature can be adjusted accordingly by lowering and raising the heat lamp in the chick's brooder. Temperature can also be monitored by the use of a thermometer. Wooden chips are often used in the bottom of the brooder as a bedding. = Food and water = Chicks require different food than adult chickens. Chicks need a mash or dust food so that they are able to digest it without grit. Adult chickens are able to digest grit, which allows them to eat bigger food pellets. Purchasing chick food from a local feed store that is specifically for baby chicks will ensure that all nutritional requirements are being met. There are different types of food for different types of chicks. Chicks that are grown for egg-laying purposes require a lower protein level than chicks that are grown as a source of meat. Chicks should be fed and given water out of containers that ensure the chicks' safety, as some containers can injure the chicks or cause easy drowning. Concerns There are some common concerns associated with the practice of raising chickens in residential areas, specifically noise, odor, attraction of predators/pests, property values, and health. Most chicken owners say that these myths and misconceptions about chickens and their behavior are central to issues surrounding passage of city ordinances and regulations necessary for the keeping of urban chickens: =Health= Bird flu and salmonella are the two biggest concerns to human health. The risk for catching bird flu is low, according to Mark Slifka, Ph. D. Infectious Disease Expert with Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. He states this is especially true if the hens are kept in a closed environment, since they wouldn't be exposed to other birds. Salmonella is mostly associated with under-cooked chicken meat. People who have weak immune systems, such as the elderly, young children, and those with various medical conditions, are most at risk. Proper sanitation and cooking practices lessen the threat of contracting salmonellosis. Chicken feces can also infect water sources with Salmonella. If chickens are kept an adequate distance from water sources, the risk of contaminated water sources from chicken feces is significantly reduced. Avian influenza, commonly referred to as \\"bird flu\\" is spread through contact with the feces of contaminated migratory birds. Since these infected wild birds are currently only in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, there is no possible chance of it spreading to chickens elsewhere. =Noise= In some areas, roosters are banned, and only hens are allowed, and in limited numbers, to prevent problems with noise. Hens are relatively quiet as compared to pet dogs, though hens often vocalize after an egg is laid for a few minutes. The noise level during this squawking period has been measured at around 63 decibels, or about the level of two people talking. Other than post-laying squawking, normal hen sounds are not audible at . In Columbia, South Carolina it was argued that leaf blowers were far louder than chickens, that dogs produce more waste than chickens do, so neither of those concerns were a valid reason to keep a ban on them. However, the average chicken defecates upwards of seventy times a day, compared with a dog's two or three times a day, calling into question the veracity of that argument. In 1926 in Oakland, California, the department of public health and safety issued an order to \\"put your roosters in a light[-]proof coop, or devise apparatus that will hold the rooster's head down so he can't crow\\" in response to complaints about the noise they were making. =Odor= Odor concerns can be mitigated somewhat by limiting the number of chickens that a household can own. Unlike large commercial operations, where thousands of chickens are kept in close quarters and thus build up enough ammonia to create a powerful odor, small backyard operations produce proportionately less odor. Although in urban spaces where homes are situated right beside one another, steps must be taken to control odors. These range from regular cleaning to changing out the chicken's bedding. If not properly cared for, odors can become quite strong given close proximity to neighboring homes. The average chicken eliminates waste, on average, every fifteen to twenty minutes; a coop of nine chickens will produce approximately seven hundred (700) defecations per day. =Unwanted predators, pests, and rodents= Predators and rodents are already living in urban areas. Wild bird feeders, pet food, gardens, fish ponds, bird baths, trash waiting to be collected all attract raccoons, foxes, rodents and flies. Most modern chicken pens are designed to keep predators away. Rats, however, may be attracted to a yard in which excess chicken food remains on the ground on a regular basis. Chicken owners have found many different ways of protecting chickens from predators without significant impact on the area. =Property values= One of the arguments against allowing backyard hens is that chickens kept within city limits will cause a reduction in property values.

It was subsequently significantly enlarged in 1347 by Al-ud- din Hasan Bahmani of the Bahmani Dynasty after he cut off his ties with the Delhi Sultanate; Islamic monuments such as mosques, palaces, tombs, and other structures were also built later within the refurbished fort. The Jama Masjid built later, within the fort, in 1367, is a unique structure built in Persian architectural style, fully enclosed, with elegant domes and arched columns, which is unlike any other mosque in India. It was built to commemorate the establishment of the dynastic rule of the Bahmani kingdom at Gulbarga fort between 1327 and 1424. It remained the capital of the Bahmani Kingdom till 1424 where after the capital was shifted to Bidar Fort, as Bidar had better climatic conditions. History The early history of the region dates back to the 6th century when the Rashtrakutas ruled over the external areas, except Gulbarga city. The Chalukyas won back their domain and ruled for over two hundred years. The Kalachuris of Kalyani succeeded them and ruled till the 12th century. At the end of the 12th century, it came under the reign of the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hoysalas of Halebid. During this period, the Kakatiya dynasty, kings of Warangal were also powerful and took control of the present Gulbarga district and Raichur District. The Kakatiya power was subdued in 1321, and the northern Deccan, including the district of Gulbarga, passed under the control of the Muslim Sultanate of Delhi. In the early 14th century, the Deccan was occupied by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate, which included Gulbarga. The revolt of the Muslim officers appointed from Delhi resulted in the founding of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347 by Alauddin Hassan, who chose Gulbarga (named as 'Ahsenabad' during this period) to be his capital. Gulbarga was the capital of the Bahmani kingdom (1347‚Äì1527) (with headquarters at the Gulbarga fort), a newly founded independent state, until 1424 when the capital was transferred to Bidar. It is said that with the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom, the Muslim rule took firm roots in the Deccan. Ahmad Shah Wali Bahmani had inducted immigrants from Iraq, Iran and Central Asia, which changed the social, cultural and religious life in the Deccan but was well amalgamated with Hindu traditions.Joshi p.35-36 The Gulbarga fort was razed to the ground by the Vijayanagar Emperor but was subsequently rebuilt by Yusuf Adil Shah (1459‚Äì1511), who established the Adil Shah dynasty or Bijapur Sultanate, when he defeated the Vijayanagar emperor. The Vijayanagara Empire was plundered and with this rich booty, the Gulbarga fort was refurbished.  World‚Äôs Longest Cannon at Bahmani Fort  The Bahmani Sultanate was a first independent Islamic state of the Deccan in South India and one of the great medieval Indian kingdoms. During the 191 years (1347-1538 A.D.) of Bahmani reign ruled with Gulbarga (Ahasnabad) and Bidar as their capital It was a great discovery for National award-winning artist and photographer Mohammed Ayazuddin Patel, Indo-Islamic Art of North Karnataka researcher Dr. Rehaman Patel and coin collector Mohammed Ismail that have found the World's longest canon in our own city. It is exciting news for Gulbarga and Hyderabad Karnataka region people that the longest canon is located in Gulbarga fort installed during the reign of Bahmani Empire in the 14th century made by Turkish. It is made up of alloy (Panch dhatu). It is the Bara Gazi toph (canon) which measures about 29 feet in length. The circumference is 7.6 feet, diameter 2 feet and thickness is 7 inch. The canon which claims to be the largest one in the world is just 23 feet long. This canon is located Koulas fort in Nizamabad district, Telangana. The Asaf Jah-I (first Nizam) granted the Koulas fort to Rajput king Raja Kunwar Gopal Singh Gaur in 1724 AD for his bravery in the battle of Balapur and Shakkar Kheda. The Archaeological Survey of India and State Archaeology should take immediate step to protect the Gulbarga fort canon and it should be included in the world record list. Fencing should be done around the canon for its safety. The canon is filled with mud and small stones which should be cleaned. Also, a signboard containing the details about the size of canon mentioning it as ‚Äòthe longest canon in the world is required. The Bahmanis ruled over most of the Deccan until the late 15th and early 16th century, when the kingdom was divided into five independent states. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707) captured the fort in the 17th century (1687) and appointed Asaf Jah I (\\"Nizam-ul-Mulk\\") as the Governor of the Deccan. In the early part of the 18th century, when Mughal Empire was declining, the Nizam became independent in 1724, and formed the Hyderabad State, of which Gulbarga area was a part. The fort and the Gulbarga district were a part of Kingdom of Hyderabad under the Nizams rule. After India became independent in August 1947, Hyderabad state was annexed to the Indian union in 1948. In 1956, the Indian state of Hyderabad was partitioned among neighboring states along linguistic lines and renamed as Andhra Pradesh(now Telangana). Most of the Gulbarga district became part of the then Mysore state, later renamed Karnataka, excluding two taluks, which were given to Andhra Pradesh. Geography It is located on a plateau land in the northeastern part of Karnataka. Krishna River and Bhima River drain the district. The soil formation in the region is predominantly of black cotton soil. Fort is in the drought prone district and experiences a meagre average rainfall of with only 46 normal rainy days. Climate is dry and cold in the winter but summer is hot. South west monsoon brings rains. Temperature during summer is a high of , the minimum recorded in winter is . Structures With the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom in the Deccan from 1347, the architectural styles of the Persian architecture of Iran made impressive and lasting impacts, which are seen in the Gulbarga Fort. The mosques, arches, gardens, and the palaces were built within and also outside the fort in the Gulbarga town. Within the fort, the buildings built are impressive with Indo- Persian architecture that evolved in the Deccan. Professor Desai has observed: > A distinct Indo-Persian architectural style of Deccan came into existence > after the establishment of the Bahmani dynasty in 1347. Some of the important structures built are elaborated. = Fort = The fort was originally built by first Sultan Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah, the founder of Bahmani Empire. It was subsequently substantially fortified in West Asian and European military architectural style by Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah, the founder of the Bahmani Empire; particular mention is made of the citadel that was added in the centre of the fort. The fort has an area of approximately and periphery length of . It is well fortified with double fortification. A wide moat surrounds the fort. The fort is a monumental structure highly fortified with 15 towers mounted with 26 guns; each gun located inside the fort is long and is still well preserved. It is said that the Bahmani Sultanate claimed lineage of the Sasanians and the motifs on their buildings, particularly the crowns of the arches that they built depicted an emblem of the crescent and occasionally a disk that was closely reminiscent of the crowns of the Sassanian emperors. Many religious or secular buildings in the fort area depict this emblem. = Jami Masjid = The mosque, one of the first in South India, was built to commemorate Gulbarga as the capital of the Bahmani Sultanate. The mosque though simple in design but has a symmetrical plan with well organized constituent parts. The masjid, only one of its kind in India, has dimensions of x and was built on the lines of the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba in Spain. The masjid, which was in ruins, has been well tended now. The mosque has no open courtyard. The outer passageways surround the prayer hall on three sides and have low open arcades with arches. They form a rectangular layout with ten bays each on the north and the south, and seven bays on the east. The square bays on the corners are topped by domes. The roofed interior bays are covered with low domes, faceted by pendentives. The front yard in front of the mihrab has nine bays with a single large dome. Trefoil interiors and elongated lobes are seen on sloping arches of the drum. The main roof drum is mounted on a cubic clerestory. The wooden screens that existed on the outer arcade openings have been removed over the years. They have been replaced, in recent times, by an arched entrance portal on the north face. On the whole, the mosque displays distinct Persian architectural style with five large domes (One large and four small at the corners) and 75 small domes with 250 arches. = Tomb of Khaja Bande Nawaz = Dargah of Khaja Banda Nawaz Apart from the above monuments the other building of interest is the tomb of the Sufi saint Syed Mohammad Gesu Daraz, popularly known as Khwaja Bande Nawaz, built in the Indo-Saracenic style. It is a large complex where the tomb of the Sufi saint, who came to Gulbarga in 1413, exists. The tomb walls have paintings; the arches of the Dargah are in Bahmani architecture while the paintings on the walls and ceiling have a fusion of Turkish and Irani influence. The Mughals also built a mosque close to the tomb. An annual fair or Urs is held here in November, which attracts large number of devotees of all religious communities. According to painter and scholar Rehman Patel, who provided the photograph and other details of the Feroze Shah lake, says that this rare photograph finds a place in the album that was made for the Nizam. A study of the 19th Century photographs in India would be incomplete without a study of the prolific works of photographs by Raja Lal Deen Dayal. At a time when the world of the photograph was dominated by British and European photographers, Mr. Dayal was the sole Indian who photographed extensively and was immensely sought-after.

The blaze continued to rage out of control for over a week after it started and during the period half a million people were evacuated from the area. The oil depot is about south of the city of Jaipur The incident occurred when petrol was being transferred from the Indian Oil Corporation's oil depot to a pipeline. There were at least 40 IOC employees at the terminal (situated close to the Jaipur International Airport) when it caught fire with an explosion. The Met department recorded a tremor measuring 2.3 on the Richter scale around the time the first explosion at 7:36 pm which resulted in shattering of glass windows nearly from the accident site. 2009 fire The fire was a major disaster in terms of deaths, injury, loss of business, property and man-days, displacement of people, environmental impact in Jaipur, the capital city of the Indian state of Rajasthan and a popular tourist destination. As per eyewitnesses having factories and hotels around Indian Oil's Sitapura (Jaipur) Oil Terminal they felt presence of petrol vapour in the atmosphere around 4:00 p.m. on 29 October 2009. Within the next few hours the concentration of petrol vapour intensified making it difficult to breathe. The Ayush Hotel in the vicinity of the terminal asked all its guests to vacate the hotel to avert any tragedy. Adjacent to the terminal wall was the workshop of Morani Motors (P) Limited where as per eyewitnesses cars parked on the roof top were thrown up into the air to about 10 feet and 35 new Hyundai brand cars were completely destroyed. The police, civil administration and fire emergency services were oblivious to the situation developing in the Indian Oil Terminal. Around half past six the staff in the terminal who had contained the leak and flow of petrol panicked and reported the matter to nearby Sanganer Sadar Police Station. Within the next 30 minutes the local police chief and District Collector were on the spot along with the terminal's general manager, but with no plan to deal with the situation. The nearby industries, which were running second shifts, were cautioned to vacate the area. At 7:35 p.m. a huge ball of fire with loud explosion broke out engulfing the leaking petrol tank and other nearby petrol tanks with continuous fire with flames rising and visible from a radius. The traffic on adjacent National Highway No.12 was stopped leading to a long traffic jam. The Jaipur International Airport is just away from the accident site. Both the army and experts from Mumbai were employed on 30 October 2009 to contain the fire in the Sitapura Industrial Area. The district administration disconnected electricity and evacuated nearby areas to limit the damage. The fire still raged on 31 October. By then, the accident had already claimed eleven lives and seriously injured more than 150 people. The District Administration and Indian Oil Corporation had no disaster management plan to deal with this kind of calamity. The local fire officers were ill-equipped to deal with fire accidents of this magnitude. They remained onlookers and no efforts were made to breach the terminal wall to get closer to kerosene and diesel tanks to cool them with water jets. The fire was blamed on non-observance of normal safety procedures. The depot fire raged for 11 days, killed 11 people in all and resulted in losses worth Rs 2.80 billion. 2012 fire A major fire broke out at a petrol storage tank of state‚Äîowned Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) Hazira terminal in Gujarat. No casualties were reported immediately. Local authorities and the company rushed fire tenders to douse the fire. Officials said the fire was reported in the afternoon at one of IOC's five petrol storage tanks at the Hazira depot. The tank had held almost 5,000 kilolitre of petrol, half of its capacity, when it caught fire. Senior IOC officials rushed to Hazira to supervise operations and an inquiry was ordered to ascertain its causes. The depot was a so-called 'white-oil terminal', housing a tank farm to store petrol and five diesel tanks. Fire brigade personnel from Surat and nearby cities. IOC sent fire tenders from its Koyali refinery to help douse the fire. \\"The fire has been isolated\\", a company official said. \\"A high-level team has been constituted to investigate the cause of the fire but our first priority is to put out the fire...efforts are on at war footing\\". This was the second major fire at an IOC storage depots in three years. Inventory The following products were stored in eleven tanks inside the terminal: * Petrol () * Kerosene () * High Speed Diesel () * Interface () Aftermath About 12 people lost their lives due to burns and asphyxia and more than 300 suffered injuries. Many of the dead were the employees of Indian Oil Corporation. Disaster Management Plan THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT ACT, 2005 envisages that each revenue District must have a Disaster Management Plan. While 31 revenue Districts of Rajasthan had placed the Disaster Management Plan on Rajasthan Government website Jaipur District did not have any Disaster Management Plan. A Disaster Management Plan for Jaipur District has been put on Internet on 17 November 2009 i.e. 20 days after the accident took place on 29 October 2009. In the meanwhile Jaipur suffered two more disasters when Swine Flu infected a number of school children prompting Government to order closure of schools, and derailment of a Train Mandore Express killing six persons and injuring more than 50 persons. Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board Report A Legal Notice has been issued to Indian Oil Corporation for violating The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Report Air pollution across Jaipur was way above maximum permitted limits when the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) depot on the edge of the city was caught fire. It significant effect on the air in Delhi or Agra, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported. Almost of oil in 11 storage tanks went up in flames on the evening of 29 Oct and the blaze raged till 6 Nov. Investigations The Petroleum Minister of India Murli Deora had appointed a 5-member committee to investigate the causes of Fire and submit its report within 60 days. The Industries & Education Institutions in Sitapura Industrial Area have filed about 150 complaints with Sanganer Sadar police station about deaths, injury and loss of property due to negligence of Indian Oil Corporation Limited. Central Bureau of Investigation Case Variation in stock of liquid petroleum products due to temperature variation, evaporation, handling (and also due to pilferage) result in what is known as stock loss. Percentage stock loss for every product for every depot is fixed based on historical operating data. Monitoring of stock loss is done on shift basis daily. Abnormal variation in stock loss beyond permitted limit invites explanation and even disciplinary actions for the officers at the Depots and Terminals. The Competent Authorities for such chargesheeting for Depot level Officers for such lapses are Executive Director (Supplies) and Director (Marketing) who prefer to selectively issue chargesheets to defaulting officers to protect their favourites.

The duo allege that they were not given the compensation of Rs. 1,000,000 (One million rupees) promised by Mr. Murli Deora the Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India. The widows are also upset that the company Indian Oil and the arrested officers have tried to pass on blame on their husbands. They are now opposing the accused officers in High Court against quashing of First Information Report and grant of bail to them. Compensation The State Government promptly announced a cash compensation of Rs. 2,000,000.00 to the dead and in addition Indian Oil Corporation paid Rs. 10,000,000.00 to the next of the kin of dead and varied amount of compensation between Rs. 1,000,000.00 and 2,000,000.00 to the injured. It has been decided to review the location of all Oil Terminals throughout India and shift these terminals beyond city limits within a period of next 12‚Äì18 months. =Sitapura Industries Association= The SITAPURA INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION has 1383 units, consisting of 325 garment, 115 jewellers, 110 handicraft, and other units like chemical, cable, manufacturing, IT, BPO, Auto parts, Educational Institutes and Hospitals having an investment of over 750 billion. The SITAPURA INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION have played an important part in shaping the economy of the State of Rajasthan and generation of employment (approximately 1,000,000 direct/indirect workers). The SITAPURA INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION has played an important role in exports and generation of foreign exchange. That on 29 October 2009 at about 4:00 p.m. some leakage of Petrol started in IOC Terminal and by 6:00 p.m. the fumes had spread far and wide in and around the Indian Oil Corporation terminal. That a huge explosion and fire erupted at 7:35 p.m. and the noise and shock waves were so intense that it gave an impression of an earthquake to the Industries of the area. The neighbouring industries adjacent to the Indian Oil Corporation terminal suffered major structural damages, loss of inventory, equipment, and finished goods. As a consequence of the Fire and associated hazards the District Collector, Jaipur declared a 5 km. zone as dangerous area and prohibited entry of the persons and vehicles in the area. The SITAPURA INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION claims to have lost Rs. 4000 million worth of property, equipment and inventory instantaneously on 29 October 2009. Thereafter the loss of production, dispatch and consequent loss of goodwill is valued at Rs. 2000 million per day. The industries were allowed free access to their units since 5 November 2009. The total estimated loss is valued at 18000 million. As an EPZ is part of the SITAPURA INDUSTRIAL AREA it houses a number of export- oriented units. The peak season for the export oriented units was at handshake. Due to fire and subsequent pollution and dispersion of carbon soot particles in atmosphere almost 100% finished garments would fail in stringent quality test and would have to be dumped in the domestic market at throwaway prices. As the industries are most likely to falter on their export commitment, the loss of Goodwill will takes years to rebuild.

On the 18th bend is a church and a view point of Dindigul city and the \\"Dindigul Rock Fort\\". The hill contains a small waterfall as well. The famous Sirumalai banana is slowly disappearing from disease, which scientists have been unable to prevent. Man-made fires on the hills have destroyed medicinal plants and threatened the fauna habitat. Fires are often set to promote vegetation growth used for animal fodder, clear land for cultivation, or improve access to timber.  Attractions  Sirumalai Lake contains a small lake that was artificially created in the year 2010. In the region of sirumalai the Agasthiarpuram is a holy place where siddas (monks) have lived since ancient days. The area is surrounded with medicinal herbs and plants. At the top of the hill there is historic Shiva Lingam, which dates back at least 500 years. The famous Lord Murugan temple (Vellimalai Murugan Temple) is located in the mountain which is away from 45 minutes climbing over the valley. Flora and fauna Much of the Sirumalai is covered by deciduous forests - the lower slopes by dry deciduous and the higher slopes and riverine valleys by moist and wet deciduous forests. Trees such as Terminalia , Shorea , Magnolia champaca are dominant in these hills. Other rare plants such as Lianas and Orchids also occur in the higher elevation evergreen tracts. Coffee estates form a major portion of present-day landscape. These Reserve Forests are protected under Tamil Nadu Forest Department. A rich animal life including threatened animals such as Slender loris, Gaur, Sambar deer, Sloth bear, Asian palm civet, Indian hare, Jungle cat and Indian pangolin are to be seen in the wild. Birds such as Indian peafowl, Asian koel, Indian grey hornbill and even the endemic Blue-winged parakeet are found in these forests. Threatened reptiles such as the Python molurus, Indian star tortoise, and venomous snakes such as Indian cobra, Russell's viper, Common krait and the endemic Bamboo pit viper and the little-known striped coral snake Calliophis nigrescens are found here. Lizards such as the Bengal monitor, the Indian chameleon, the flying lizard or Draco dussumieri, Calotes calotes, Ophisops minor and Cnemaspis geckoes are to be seen here. Special mention must be made of the only endemic reptile of the hill - the Sirumalai Shieldtail Snake Uropeltis dindigalensis, that is reportedly not found anywhere else. Rare and endemic amphibians such as Hylarana, Indirana, Zakerana brevipalmata and the direct-developing bush frog Pseudophilautus wynaadensis occur here. A myriad forms of lesser-known Insects and Moths etc. are present.  Agathya Puram  Located in Sirumalai is Agathya Puram. Named after the prominent Agathya Siddhar. Located in Agathya Puram is Silver Hill, this is the tallest hill in Sirumalai. It is said that the peak of the Silver hill was made up of Silver but to avoid man's destruective actions during the Kali Yuga the hill was transformed via Alchemy in to stone by Agathya Siddhar, hence it got the name silver hill. The hills silver glitter can be still seen in the sun light. In the peak of this Silver hill is a 500-year-old Shiva Lingam, walk to top of the hill is about 30 ‚Äì 45 minutes. The view from the silver Hill is breathtaking.  Agatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar Peedam  Agatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar peedam is an ashram located at the silver hill in Agathya Puram. Food is served daily (Annadanam), lodging is available at the ashram. The ashram aims to promote various voluntary campaigns such as cleaning of the hills.

It was suggested by Charles H. Bennett in 1976. Preliminaries Take a system in a certain super (i.e. Gibbs) state. By performing a Metropolis Monte Carlo walk it is possible to sample the landscape of states that the system moves between, using the equation : p(\\\\text{State}_x \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{State}_y) = \\\\min \\\\left(e ^ { - \\\\beta \\\\, \\\\Delta U} , 1 \\\\right) = M(\\\\beta \\\\, \\\\Delta U) where ŒîU = U(Statey) ‚àí U(Statex) is the difference in potential energy, Œ≤ = 1/kT (T is the temperature in kelvins, while k is the Boltzmann constant), and M(x) \\\\equiv \\\\min(e^{-x} , 1) is the Metropolis function. The resulting states are then sampled according to the Boltzmann distribution of the super state at temperature T. Alternatively, if the system is dynamically simulated in the canonical ensemble (also called the NVT ensemble), the resulting states along the simulated trajectory are likewise distributed. Averaging along the trajectory (in either formulation) is denoted by angle brackets \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\cdots \\\\right\\\\rangle . Suppose that two super states of interest, A and B, are given. We assume that they have a common configuration space, i.e., they share all of their micro states, but the energies associated to these (and hence the probabilities) differ because of a change in some parameter (such as the strength of a certain interaction). The basic question to be addressed is, then, how can the Helmholtz free energy change (ŒîF = FB ‚àí FA) on moving between the two super states be calculated from sampling in both ensembles? Note that the kinetic energy part in the free energy is equal between states so can be ignored. Note also that the Gibbs free energy corresponds to the NpT ensemble. The general case Bennett shows that for every function f satisfying the condition f(x)/f(-x) \\\\equiv e^{-x} (which is essentially the detailed balance condition), and for every energy offset C, one has the exact relationship : e ^ { - \\\\beta (\\\\Delta F - C)} = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle f\\\\left(\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A} - C)\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A}}{\\\\left\\\\langle f\\\\left(\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{A} - U_\\\\text{B} + C)\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{B}} where UA and UB are the potential energies of the same configurations, calculated using potential function A (when the system is in superstate A) and potential function B (when the system is in the superstate B) respectively. The basic case Substituting for f the Metropolis function defined above (which satisfies the detailed balance condition), and setting C to zero, gives : e ^ { - \\\\beta \\\\Delta F} = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle M\\\\left(\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A})\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A}}{\\\\left\\\\langle M\\\\left(\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{A} - U_\\\\text{B})\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{B}} The advantage of this formulation (apart from its simplicity) is that it can be computed without performing two simulations, one in each specific ensemble. Indeed, it is possible to define an extra kind of \\"potential switching\\" Metropolis trial move (taken every fixed number of steps), such that the single sampling from the \\"mixed\\" ensemble suffices for the computation. The most efficient case Bennett explores which specific expression for ŒîF is the most efficient, in the sense of yielding the smallest standard error for a given simulation time. He shows that the optimal choice is to take # f(x) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^x} , which is essentially the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution (satisfying indeed the detailed balance condition). # C \\\\approx \\\\Delta F . This value, of course, is not known (it is exactly what one is trying to compute), but it can be approximately chosen in a self-consistent manner. Some assumptions needed for the efficiency are the following: # The densities of the two super states (in their common configuration space) should have a large overlap. Otherwise, a chain of super states between A and B may be needed, such that the overlap of each two consecutive super states is adequate. # The sample size should be large. In particular, as successive states are correlated, the simulation time should be much larger than the correlation time. # The cost of simulating both ensembles should be approximately equal - and then, in fact, the system is sampled roughly equally in both super states. Otherwise, the optimal expression for C is modified, and the sampling should devote equal times (rather than equal number of time steps) to the two ensembles. Multistate Bennett acceptance ratio The multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) is a generalization of the Bennett acceptance ratio that calculates the (relative) free energies of several multi states. It essentially reduces to the BAR method when only two super states are involved. Relation to other methods =The perturbation theory method= This method, also called Free energy perturbation (or FEP), involves sampling from state A only. It requires that all the high probability configurations of super state B are contained in high probability configurations of super state A, which is a much more stringent requirement than the overlap condition stated above. The exact (infinite order) result : e ^ { - \\\\beta \\\\Delta F} = \\\\left\\\\langle e ^{ - \\\\beta (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A})} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} or : \\\\Delta F = -kT \\\\cdot \\\\log \\\\left\\\\langle e ^{\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{A} - U_\\\\text{B})} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} This exact result can be obtained from the general BAR method, using (for example) the Metropolis function, in the limit C \\\\rightarrow -\\\\infty . Indeed, in that case, the denominator of the general case expression above tends to 1, while the numerator tends to e^{\\\\beta C} \\\\left\\\\langle e^{-\\\\beta (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A})} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} . A direct derivation from the definitions is more straightforward, though. The second order (approximate) result Assuming that U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A} \\\\ll kT and Taylor expanding the second exact perturbation theory expression to the second order, one gets the approximation : \\\\Delta F \\\\approx \\\\left\\\\langle U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} - \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\langle (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A})^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} - \\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle (U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A}) \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{A}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right) Note that the first term is the expected value of the energy difference, while the second is essentially its variance. The first order inequalities Using the convexity of the log function appearing in the exact perturbation analysis result, together with Jensen's inequality, gives an inequality in the linear level; combined with the analogous result for the B ensemble one gets the following version of the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality: : \\\\langle U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A} \\\\rangle_\\\\text{B} \\\\le \\\\Delta F \\\\le \\\\langle U_\\\\text{B} - U_\\\\text{A} \\\\rangle_\\\\text{A} Note that the inequality agrees with the negative sign of the coefficient of the (positive) variance term in the second order result. =The thermodynamic integration method= writing the potential energy as depending on a continuous parameter, U_\\\\text{A} = U(\\\\lambda = 0), U_\\\\text{B} = U(\\\\lambda = 1), one has the exact result \\\\frac{\\\\partial F(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\lambda This can either be directly verified from definitions or seen from the limit of the above Gibbs- Bogoliubov inequalities when \\\\text{A} = \\\\lambda^+, \\\\text{B} = \\\\lambda^- . we can therefore write : \\\\Delta F = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\, d\\\\lambda which is the thermodynamic integration (or TI) result. It can be approximated by dividing the range between states A and B into many values of Œª at which the expectation value is estimated, and performing numerical integration.

He later became the Minister of Works (July 2003 to March 2006). When he was sacked from this position by President Olusegun Obasanjo, it was said to be due to a feud with his former patron, Bode George, the Deputy National Chairman of the PDP. Background Ogunlewe is from an affluent dynasty of Igbogbo, a community in the Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State. His elder brother, Dr. Akin Ogunlewe, was a permanent secretary in the Federal Ministry of Commerce and Industry, who was relieved of his position soon after Ogunlewe transferred to the PDP. Ogunlewe is an alumnus of the University of Ibadan. During his stay in the premier University he lived in Mellanby Hall and participated actively in students politics. He is a lawyer, and at one time was permanent secretary of Lagos State. Senator In July 2002, Senator Wahab Dosunmu and Adeseye Ogunlewe accused Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu of abusing trust of public funds through contract awards to his friends. He ran for reelection in 2003 on the PDP ticket, but was defeated by Olorunnimbe Mamora of the Alliance for Democracy (AD). Minister of works In July 2003, Ogunlewe announced that the federal government would invest about US$2.85 billion in rehabilitating and upgrading the nation's highway network, and planned to make all roads in the country accessible by year end. In January 2004, Ogunlewe said the Federal government had approved an extra N900 million for rehabilitation of roads in the South-east. In April 2004, Ogunlewe won the Dr Kwame Nkrumah Africa Leadership Award in Accra, Ghana. In May 2004, Ogunlewe published his mobile phone number and told people to use it if they saw any pot-holes or had a traffic accident. He said he was inundated with calls, but also said of the roads \\"They are fantastic now.\\" He claimed that 12,600 km of roads had been rehabilitated in the past six months. In June 2004, there were clashes in Lagos state between agents of the Federal Ministry of Works and officials of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority. The clashes were over control of Federal roads, and were apparently linked to ongoing disputes between Ogunlewe and the state governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the Alliance for Democracy. In August 2004, Ogunlewe announced that The World Bank and the African Development Bank planned to cooperate with Nigeria to build the Trans-West African Highway from Lagos to Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. In October 2004, Ogunlewe stated that the year 2005 would see faster rapid progress in road repair and construction. In March 2006, after being dismissed from his job as Works Minister, Ogunlewe urged President Olusegun Obasanjo to seek a third term in office. Later career In July 2006, a Lagos State governorship candidate, Funsho Williams was found murdered in his home. Ogunlewe, who had been a rival for the PDP nomination, was arrested in connection with the murder. He was later released, but in February 2007, he was re-arrested. In November 2009, the Senate ad hoc committee on transport led by Heineken Lokpobiri, submitted a report to the upper house that revealed \\"alleged serial malpractices\\" in road contracting over a ten- year period, and recommended that former ministers of works Anthony Anenih, Adeseye Ogunlewe, Obafemi Anibaba, Cornelius Adebayo and others be prosecuted for corruption.

The paper was founded by Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick, the second bishop of Boston, at a time of increased Irish immigration to the United States and rising anti-Catholic animus to the newcomers' church. In its first edition, Bishop Fenwick wrote that the newspaper's purpose was to defend against the \\"crying calumnies and gross misrepresentations which in this section of the country have been so long, so unsparingly, so cruelly heaped upon the Church.\\"A Brief History of the Boston Pilot, Information Wanted, Database of Irish immigrants, Boston College, accessed 16 April 2011 In 1834, Fenwick sold the publication to two laymen‚ÄîHenry Devereux, the publisher, and Patrick Donahoe, an employee who quickly became the newspaper's sole proprietor. In 1838, Donahoe became editor, and he maintained control of the newspaper until his death in 1891. During much of the 19th century, The Pilot acquired a reputation of being an Irish-American cultural newspaper. The great majority of Boston's Catholics were originally immigrants from Ireland, with tens of thousands arriving during and after the Great Famine. Notable editors linked to the movement for Irish independence include John Boyle O'Reilly, James Jeffrey Roche and Thomas D'Arcy McGee. Archbishop William Henry O'Connell purchased the paper in 1908 and turned it into the official voice of Boston's archdiocese. He closely monitored its editorial policies and sought to promote its readership among local Catholic families. In 1979, The Pilot celebrated its 150th anniversary and featured special information about the newspaper's history. As of 2004, its circulation was of 23,039 printed copies. In 2006, the newspaper launched its online edition, TheBostonPilot.com, which offers expanded content and multimedia features. Titles Beginning as The Jesuit or Catholic Sentinel, the newspaper's name was changed several times in its first seven years. Titles included The Jesuit, The United States Catholic Intelligencer, and The Literary and Catholic Sentinel. By 1836, Patrick Donahoe changed the name of the newspaper to The Boston Pilot, partly in tribute to the Dublin Pilot. In 1858, the newspaper's Old English nameplate The Pilot appeared for the first time, under the editorship of Father Joseph M. Finotti, along with the motto, \\"Be just and fear not, let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy God's, thy Country's and Truth's\\". Despite the fact that the name The Pilot and its logo have remained essentially unchanged for over 150 years, it is not uncommon for the newspaper to be referred to as The Boston Pilot to this day.

It consists of the original settlement of Le Lioran in the valley bottom as well as the settlements of Prairie de Sagnes, Font d'Alagon, Font de C√®re, and Prat du Bouc, all of which are geared towards the mountain tourism market. The largest of these is the Prairie de Sagnes, now known as Super-Lioran; most facilities and accommodation are concentrated there. One of the few remaining resorts in central France, it has grown to become one of the biggest and most advanced resorts in the Massif Central. There is a wide range of sporting and leisure activities on offer in addition to the more traditional winter sports and the wealth of lodging and other services available. There is a heavy emphasis on the all year round nature of the resort, although, inevitably, the resort is busiest in the winter season. Geography Within France it is administratively located in the commune of Laveissi√®re, the canton of Murat, the arrondissement of Saint-Flour, the d√©partement of Cantal, and the r√©gion of Auvergne. However, the village of Prat du Bouc is located in the commune of Albepierre-Bredons, but shares the same upwards administrative chain as the other settlements. History The resort is among the newest within the Massif Central, with skiing appearing in the area around the beginning of the 20th century, although the area became forgotten during World War II. Afterwards interest in the sport in the area resurfaced, possibly owing to the influence of the British. The first lift to be constructed at the resort was the T√©l√©ski D√©brayable de Masseb≈ìuf, a single place detachable button lift built by one of the residents in 1947. This lift continued to operate until 1984 when it was replaced by a three place fixed chair lift. The next lift to be built was the T√©l√©ski D√©brayable de la Gare, built in 1965, to provide a link between the railway station in the valley bottom and Prairie de Sagnes further up the mountain, it is still running today. As the end of the 1950s approached, Hector Peschaud, the s√©nateur and pr√©sident of the conseil g√©n√©ral at the time proposed the idea of constructing a resort on the site of Prairie de Sagnes. The d√©partement of Cantal put out a tender for architects and mountain developers to build a resort on the site. This prompted a major contributor to the development of the resort with the construction of the T√©l√©ph√©rique du Plomb du Cantal, an eighty place cable car, completed in 1967 with the aid of, and inaugurated by, locally born Georges Pompidou who would shortly succeed Charles de Gaulle as President of France. From then on, development at the resort snowballed.

A native of Utah, he served as president of Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University), Brigham Young College (not to be confused with Brigham Young University), and Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University). He later served as the first chancellor of what became the Oregon University System. The administration building at Oregon State University is named in his honor. Early life and education Kerr was born on November 17, 1863, in Richmond in the then Utah Territory. He received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 1885. He planned to study law, and turned down appointment to West Point in order to go into law, but never did go into the profession. He married Leonora Hamilton in 1885, and had four daughters and two sons. When he was 21 years old he worked as a manager for a mercantile company before entering the teaching profession as a teacher in Smithfield, Utah. Raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) during the time when plural marriage (polygamy) was taught and practiced, Kerr later married a second wife, Lois Cordelia Morehead, a schoolteacher in Smithfield, Utah and they had two children, a son and a daughter. After the church renounced the practice, Kerr divorced his second wife in 1898. The emotional impact caused Kerr and his wives to leave the LDS Church. Kerr served as a delegate to the Utah's constitutional conventions in both 1887 and 1895. He also studied at Cornell University in New York. Career Kerr began his academic career in 1887 when he joined the faculty of Brigham Young College as a mathematics professor. He also taught at the University of Utah. He then served as president of Brigham Young College in Logan, Utah, from 1894 to 1900. In 1900, he left Brigham Young to become the president of Utah State Agricultural College, now Utah State University, also in Logan. Kerr left Utah State in 1907 and became the eighth president at Oregon Agricultural College, now Oregon State University (OSU), in Corvallis, Oregon. When he was considered for president of Oregon State College in 1907, the public animosity for Mormonism invited attacks on Kerr's polygamous past, until he reasserted his rejection of the faith. He served as the president of OSU for 25 years, 1907 until 1932. As president, he oversaw a large expansion of the school, adding 23 buildings and growing the campus from to . As part of the expansion he hired John C. Olmsted to draft a master plan for OSU's campus. In 1911, he was the president of the Association of Land Grant Colleges and Universities. Kerr left OSU in 1932 when he became the first chancellor of the Oregon State System of Higher Education serving in that position until 1935. Death and legacy Following his retirement, Kerr moved to Portland, where he died on April 15, 1947, at the age of 83. The library at Oregon State University had been named in his honor, but after it was renamed as The Valley Library his name was added to the administration building.

It was the main holy site of Asclepius. The sanctuary at Epidaurus was the rival of such major cult sites as the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia and Apollo at Delphi. The temple was built in the early 4th-century BC. If still in use by the 4th- century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when the Christian Emperors issued edicts prohibiting non-Christian worship. Myth and history Pausanias described the myth around the foundation of the temple, as well as its religious significance to the worship of Asclepius in the 2nd century: :Before you reach Epidauros itself [in Argos] you will come to the sanctuary of Asklepios ... That the land is especially sacred to Asklepios is due to the following reason. The Epidaurians say that Phlegyas came to the Peloponnesos . . . accompanied by his daughter [Koronis mother of Asklepios], who all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by Apollon. In the country of the Epidaurians she bore a son [Asklepios], and exposed him on the mountain called Titthion (Nipple) at the present day, but then named Myrtion... There is other evidence that the god was born in Epidauros; for I find that the most famous sanctuaries of Asklepios had their origin from Epidauros. In the first place, the Athenians, who say they gave a share of their mystic rites to Asklepios, call this day of the festival Epidauria, and they allege that their worship of Asklepios dates from then. Again, when Arkhias, son of Aristaikhmos, was healed in Epidauria after spraining himself after hunting about Pindasos, he brought the cult to Pergamon [in Asia Minor]. From the one at Pergamos has been built in our own day the sanctuary of Asklepios by the sea at Smyrna. Further, at Balagrai of the Kyreneans there is an Asklepios called Iatros (Healer), who like the others came from Epidauros. From the one at Kyrene was founded the sanctuary of Asklepios at Lebene, in Krete. There is this difference between the Kyreneans and the Epidaurians, that whereas the former sacrifice goats, it is against the custom of the Epidaurians to do so. That Asklepios was considered a god from the first, and did not receive the title only in the course of time. I infer from several signs, including the evidence of Homer, who makes Agamemnon say about Makhaon:--‚ÄòTalthybios, with all speed go summon me hither Makhaon, mortal son of Asklepios.‚Äô As who should say, ‚Äòhuman son of a god.‚ÄôPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) Structure The temple was Doric, six columns by eleven, measuring ca. 80 feet in length. An inscription excavated near the temple (Inscriptiones Graecae IV, 2nd ed., no. 102) gives a public record of the temple's construction. The inscription names Theodotus as architect. The project took nearly five years to complete. The temple had pedimental sculpture, front and back, and figural acroteria. These, the work of master sculptors of the period, occupy a prominent room in the National Archaeological Museum at Athens. The gold and ivory cult statue of the god is described by Pausanias, who described the sanctuary in the 2nd century: :The sacred grove of Asklepios is surrounded on all sides by boundary marks. No death or birth takes place within the enclosure; the same custom prevails also in the island of Delos. All the offerings, whether the offerer be one of the Epidaurians themselves or a stranger, are entirely consumed within the bounds. At Titane too, I know, there is this same rule. The image of Asklepios is, in size, half as big as Zeus Olympios at Athens, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription tells us that the artist was Thrasymedes, a Parian, son of Arignotos. The god is sitting on a seat grasping a staff; the other hand he is holding above the head of the serpent; there is also a figure of a dog lying by his side. On the seat are wrought in relief the exploits of Argive heroes...\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) [...] \\"When I asked at Epidauros why they pour neither water nor olive oil on the image of Asklepios [to keep the ivory in good condition], the attendants at the sanctuary informed me that both the image of the god and the throne were built over a cistern.Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 11. 11 The sanctuary is preserved in foundations only. Fragments of the upper structure, recovered in excavation, are in the archaeological museum at the site. The Temple of Asclepius itself was, however not alone on the site. Pausanias recorded several smaller buildings within the holy area and grove of the temple complex, such as a theatre, a temple of Artemis, an image of Epione, a sanctuary of Aphrodite and Themis, \\"a race-course... and a fountain worth seeing for its roof and general splendour.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) Recently added at the time of Pausanias' visit (2nd century), was several donations by a Roman senator Antoninos, counted as being: \\"a bath of Asklepios and a sanctuary of the gods called Bountiful. He made also a temple to Hygeia, Asklepios, and Apollon, the last two surnamed Aigyptios (Egyptian). He moreover restored the portico that was named the Portico of Kotys, which, as the brick of which it was made had been unburnt, had fallen into utter ruin after it had lost its roof. As the Epidaurians about the sanctuary were in great distress, because their women had no shelter in which to be delivered and the sick breathed their last in the open, he provided a dwelling, so that these grievances also were redressed. Here, at last, was a place in which without sin a human being could die and a woman be delivered...\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) Worship The temple had major religious importance in the cult of Asclepius. It was a site for holy pilgrimage from the entire ancient world, and influenced the worship of Asclepius in many other sanctuaries dedicated to him. Pausanias described how serpents were considered sacred to the god on the site: \\"The serpents, including a peculiar kind of a yellowish colour, are considered sacred to Asklepios, and are tame with men.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) Pausanias described the worship and the site's importance as a pilgrimage in the 2nd century: :Over against the temple is the place where the suppliants of the god sleep. Near has been built a circular building of white marble, called Tholos (Round House) . . . Within the enclosure stood slabs; in my time six remained, but of old there were more. On them are inscribed the names of both the men and the women who have been healed by Asklepios, the disease also from which each suffered, and the means of cure. The dialect is Doric. Apart from the others is an old slab, which declares that Hippolytos dedicated twenty horses to the god. The Arikians tell a tale that agrees with the inscription on this slab, that when Hippolytos was killed, owing to the curses of Theseus, Asklepios raised him from the dead. On coming to life again he refused to forgive his father; rejecting his prayers, he want to the Arikians in Italy...Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 28. 1 (trans. Jones) There were many legends, stories and miracles said to have taken place in the temple during the centuries of pilgrimage to it. Cicero alluded the merciful nature of Ascleius when he recounted how Dionysius of Syracusa allegedly committed sacrilege at the sanctuary without divine punishment: \\"He gave orders for the removal of the golden beard of Aesculapius at Epidaurus, saying it was not fitting for the son to wear a beard when his father [Apollo] appeared in all his temples beardless... Nor did Aesculapius cause him to waste away and perish of some painful and lingering disease.\\"Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 34 (trans. Rackham) In the 3rd century, Aelian describes a legendary miracle taking place in the sanctuary: :A woman suffered from an intestinal worm, and the cleverest doctors despaired of curing her. Accordingly, she went to Epidauros and prayed to the god [Asklepios] that she might be rid of the complaint that was lodged in her. The god was not at hand. The attendants of the temple however made her lie down in the place where the god was in the habit of healing his petitioners. And the woman lay quiet as she was bid; and the ministers of the god addressed themselves to her cure: they severed her head from the neck, and on of them inserted his hand and drew out the worm, which was a monstrous creature. But to adjust the head and to restore it to its former setting, this they always failed to do. Well, the god arrived and was enraged with the ministers for undertaking a task beyond their skill, and himself with the irresistible power of a god restored the head to the body and raised the stranger up again. For my part, O King Asklepios, of all gods the kindliest to man, I do not set Wormwood [as a cure for intestinal worms] against your skill (heaven forbid I should be so insensate!), but in considering Wormwood I was reminded of your beneficent action and of your astounding powers of healing. And there is no need to doubt that this herb also is a gift from you.Aelian, On Animals 9. 33 (trans. Scholfield) The temple could not have been in function to a later date than the 4th or 5th century, when all pagan shrines were closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

They also consider the possibility that f may only be defined on the graph of C.Compare with Theorem 3.5 in They consider the case that \\\\Theta and X are Hausdorff spaces.Theorem 3.6 in Let X and \\\\Theta be topological spaces, f:X\\\\times\\\\Theta\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be a continuous function on the product X \\\\times \\\\Theta, and C:\\\\Theta\\\\rightrightarrows X be a compact- valued correspondence such that C(\\\\theta) e \\\\emptyset for all \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta. Define the marginal function (or value function) f^* : \\\\Theta \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} by :f^*(\\\\theta)=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{f(x, \\\\theta) : x\\\\in C(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\} and the set of maximizers C^* : \\\\Theta \\\\rightrightarrows X by : C^*(\\\\theta)= \\\\mathrm{arg}\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{f(x,\\\\theta) : x \\\\in C(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in C(\\\\theta) : f(x, \\\\theta) = f^*(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\} . If C is continuous (i.e. both upper and lower hemicontinuous) at \\\\theta, then f^* is continuous and C^*is upper hemicontinuous with nonempty and compact values. As a consequence, the \\\\sup may be replaced by \\\\max and the \\\\mathrm{arg}\\\\,\\\\sup by \\\\mathrm{arg}\\\\,\\\\max. Interpretation The theorem is typically interpreted as providing conditions for a parametric optimization problem to have continuous solutions with regard to the parameter. In this case, \\\\Theta is the parameter space, f(x,\\\\theta) is the function to be maximized, and C(\\\\theta) gives the constraint set that f is maximized over. Then, f^*(\\\\theta) is the maximized value of the function and C^* is the set of points that maximize f. The result is that if the elements of an optimization problem are sufficiently continuous, then some, but not all, of that continuity is preserved in the solutions. Proof Throughout this proof we will use the term neighborhood to refer to an open set containing a particular point. We preface with a preliminary lemma, which is a general fact in the calculus of correspondences. Recall that a correspondence is closed if its graph is closed. Lemma. Compare with Theorem 7 in Chapter 6, Section 1 of Berge assumes that the underlying spaces are Hausdorff and employs this property for X (but not for C) in his proof.Compare with Proposition 2.46 in They assume implicitly that \\\\Theta and X are Hausdorff spaces, but their proof is general.Compare with Corollary 17.18 in This is given for arbitrary topological spaces, but the proof relies on the machinery of topological nets. If A, B : \\\\Theta \\\\rightrightarrows X are correspondences, A is upper hemicontinuous and compact-valued, and B is closed, then A \\\\cap B : \\\\Theta \\\\rightrightarrows X defined by (A \\\\cap B) (\\\\theta) = A(\\\\theta) \\\\cap B(\\\\theta) is upper hemicontinuous. Let \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta, and suppose G is an open set containing (A\\\\cap B)(\\\\theta). If A(\\\\theta) \\\\subseteq G, then the result follows immediately. Otherwise, observe that for each x \\\\in A(\\\\theta) \\\\setminus G we have x otin B(\\\\theta), and since B is closed there is a neighborhood U_x \\\\times V_x of (\\\\theta, x) in which x' otin B(\\\\theta') whenever (\\\\theta', x') \\\\in U_x \\\\times V_x. The collection of sets \\\\\\\\{G\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{V_x : x \\\\in A(\\\\theta) \\\\setminus G\\\\\\\\} forms an open cover of the compact set A(\\\\theta), which allows us to extract a finite subcover G, V_{x_1}, \\\\dots, V_{x_n}. Then whenever \\\\theta \\\\in U_{x_1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap U_{x_n}, we have A(\\\\theta) \\\\subseteq G \\\\cup V_{x_1} \\\\cup \\\\dots \\\\cup V_{x_n}, and so (A \\\\cap B)(\\\\theta) \\\\subseteq G. This completes the proof. \\\\square The continuity of f^* in the maximum theorem is the result of combining two independent theorems together. Theorem 1. Compare with Theorem 2 in Chapter 6, Section 3 of Berge's argument is essentially the one presented here, but he again uses auxiliary results proven with the assumptions that the underlying spaces are Hausdorff.Compare with Proposition 3.1 in They work exclusively with Hausdorff spaces, and their proof again relies on topological nets. Their result also allows for f to take on the values \\\\pm \\\\infty.Compare with Lemma 17.30 in They consider arbitrary topological spaces, and use an argument based on topological nets. If f is upper semicontinuous and C is upper hemicontinuous, nonempty and compact-valued, then f^* is upper semicontinuous. Fix \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta, and let \\\\varepsilon > 0 be arbitrary. For each x \\\\in C(\\\\theta), there exists a neighborhood U_x \\\\times V_x of (\\\\theta, x) such that whenever (\\\\theta', x') \\\\in U_x \\\\times V_x, we have f(x', \\\\theta') < f(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\varepsilon. The set of neighborhoods \\\\\\\\{V_x : x \\\\in C(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\} covers C(\\\\theta), which is compact, so V_{x_1}, \\\\dots, V_{x_n} suffice. Furthermore, since C is upper hemicontinuous, there exists a neighborhood U' of \\\\theta such that whenever \\\\theta' \\\\in U' it follows that C(\\\\theta') \\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} V_{x_k}. Let U = U' \\\\cap U_{x_1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap U_{x_n}. Then for all \\\\theta' \\\\in U, we have f(x', \\\\theta') < f(x_k, \\\\theta) + \\\\varepsilon for each x' \\\\in C(\\\\theta'), as x' \\\\in V_{x_k} for some k. It follows that : f^*(\\\\theta') = \\\\sup_{x' \\\\in C(\\\\theta')} f(x', \\\\theta') < \\\\max_{k=1, \\\\dots, n} f(x_k, \\\\theta) + \\\\varepsilon \\\\leq f^*(\\\\theta) + \\\\varepsilon, which was desired. \\\\square Theorem 2. Compare with Theorem 1 in Chapter 6, Section 3 of The argument presented here is essentially his.Compare with Proposition 3.3 in They work exclusively with Hausdorff spaces, and their proof again relies on topological nets. Their result also allows for f to take on the values \\\\pm \\\\infty.Compare with Lemma 17.29 in They consider arbitrary topological spaces and use an argument involving topological nets. If f is lower semicontinuous and C is lower hemicontinuous, then f^* is lower semicontinuous. Fix \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta, and let \\\\varepsilon > 0 be arbitrary. By definition of f^*, there exists x \\\\in C(\\\\theta) such that f^*(\\\\theta) < f(x,\\\\theta) + \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2}. Now, since f is lower semicontinuous, there exists a neighborhood U_1 \\\\times V of (\\\\theta, x) such that whenever (\\\\theta', x') \\\\in U_1 \\\\times V we have f(x, \\\\theta) < f(x', \\\\theta') + \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2}. Observe that C(\\\\theta) \\\\cap V e \\\\emptyset (in particular, x \\\\in C(\\\\theta) \\\\cap V). Therefore, since C is lower hemicontinuous, there exists a neighborhood U_2 such that whenever \\\\theta' \\\\in U_2 there exists x' \\\\in C(\\\\theta') \\\\cap V. Let U = U_1 \\\\cap U_2. Then whenever \\\\theta' \\\\in U there exists x' \\\\in C(\\\\theta') \\\\cap V, which implies :f^*(\\\\theta) < f(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2} < f(x', \\\\theta') + \\\\varepsilon \\\\leq f^*(\\\\theta') + \\\\varepsilon which was desired. \\\\square Under the hypotheses of the Maximum theorem, f^* is continuous. It remains to verify that C^* is an upper hemicontinuous correspondence with compact values. Let \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta. To see that C^*(\\\\theta) is nonempty, observe that the function f_\\\\theta : C(\\\\theta) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} by f_\\\\theta(x) = f(x, \\\\theta) is continuous on the compact set C(\\\\theta). The Extreme Value theorem implies that C^*(\\\\theta) is nonempty. In addition, since f_\\\\theta is continuous, it follows that C^*(\\\\theta) a closed subset of the compact set C(\\\\theta), which implies C^*(\\\\theta) is compact. Finally, let D : \\\\Theta \\\\rightrightarrows X be defined by D(\\\\theta) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in C(\\\\theta) : f(x, \\\\theta) = f^*(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\}. Since f is a continuous function, D is a closed correspondence. Moreover, since C^*(\\\\theta) = C(\\\\theta) \\\\cap D(\\\\theta), the preliminary Lemma implies that C^* is upper hemicontinuous. \\\\square Variants and generalizations A natural generalization from the above results gives sufficient local conditions for f^*to be continuous and C^*to be nonempty, compact-valued, and upper semi-continuous. If in addition to the conditions above, f is quasiconcave in x for each \\\\theta and C is convex-valued, then C^* is also convex-valued. If f is strictly quasiconcave in x for each \\\\theta and C is convex-valued, then C^* is single-valued, and thus is a continuous function rather than a correspondence. If f is concave and C has a convex graph, then f^* is concave and C^* is convex-valued. Similarly to above, if f is strictly concave, then C^* is a continuous function. It is also possible to generalize Berge's theorem to non-compact set-valued correspondences if the objective function is K-inf-compact.Theorem 1.2 in Examples Consider a utility maximization problem where a consumer makes a choice from their budget set. Translating from the notation above to the standard consumer theory notation, * X=\\\\mathbb{R}_+^l is the space of all bundles of l commodities, * \\\\Theta=\\\\mathbb{R}_{++}^l \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}_{++} represents the price vector of the commodities p and the consumer's wealth w, * f(x,\\\\theta)=u(x) is the consumer's utility function, and * C(\\\\theta)=B(p,w)=\\\\\\\\{x \\\\,\\\\, px \\\\leq w\\\\\\\\} is the consumer's budget set. Then, * f^*(\\\\theta)=v(p,w) is the indirect utility function and * C^*(\\\\theta)=x(p,w) is the Marshallian demand. Proofs in general equilibrium theory often apply the Brouwer or Kakutani fixed-point theorems to the consumer's demand, which require compactness and continuity, and the maximum theorem provides the sufficient conditions to do so.

He has produced many public memorials and installations in both England and throughout the United States with subjects ranging from miners, to soldiers and fire fighters. He is credited with over fifty life size and larger bronze public figures and major monuments including The Silverdale Mining Memorial, The Lance Sergeant Jack Baskeyfield VC Tribute, The Spirit of 1948, and The Dr. John Roberts Monument. Whyte's multimillion- dollar, sixteen-figure monument in San Diego, California entitled National Salute to Bob Hope and the Militaryis one of his most notable works. In 2010, Whyte unveiled a twice life size portrait monument of the 1957 Heisman Trophy Winner, John David Crow at Texas A&M; University in College Station, Texas and a life size full relief statue of St. Anthony and Child at Basilica of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo (Carmel Mission) Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA. Whyte's work also includes four life size figures for a memorial to the fallen officers of the San Diego Sheriff's Department which was unveiled in May 2011. He also completed a nine figure composition for Cannery Row, Monterey, CA, and a life size Jumbo the Elephant for Tufts University, MA. One of Whyte's most complex works, the massive statue for Texas A&M; University titled The Aggie War Hymn Monument, has twelve 1.6 times life size bronze figures of students, \\"sawing off variety's horns\\". The 10 ft by 39 ft sculpture was unveiled in September 2014, at a cost of $1.7M. In 2016 Whyte was awarded Sports Artist of the Year, sculptor, by The United States Sports Academy and The American Sport Art Museum & Archives.https://ussa.edu/news/academys-32nd-annual-awards-of- sport-program-honors-accomplishments-in-sport-and-art/ In December 2016 The Smithsonian Institution acquired Whyte's bronze bust of Congressman John Conyers Jr. for the National Portrait Gallery (United States) in Washington D.C.. Whyte was the sculptor for the Column of Strength, San Francisco's controversial Comfort Women Memorial.  Biography  The son of Campbell MacNaughton Whyte (retired Royal Air Force) and Janice Whyte (Homemaker, Gardener and Artisan), Steven Whyte was born 17 March 1969 in Amesbury, United Kingdom and grew up in various parts of Europe including Scotland, Germany, the Netherlands, England, and the Shetland Isles. Whyte, a dyslexic, has been described as first using art as a social solution, rather than a potential vocation: \\"Art class was often the only place I felt confident that I could contribute and learn at the same rate as my peers.‚Äù Whyte's first art courses were drawing and graphic design, but it was not until high school that he began learning ceramics and sculpture. As an undergraduate, he was granted a full scholarship and became the youngest applicant accepted to the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture, under the late Professor Colin Melbourne ARCA and Dame Elisabeth Frink RA. After leaving school, Whyte co-wrote the only validated figurative sculpture course in England and accepted a teaching position at Stafford College. He then became the youngest member of the London-based Society of Portrait Sculptors, where he served as Vice-President alongside President Franta Belsky PPRBS, late sculptor to the Royal Family. Whyte's early career consisted primarily of private commissions and portrait work, with over 70 completed commissioned official portraits to date. In 2003, Whyte opened his first US open studio and gallery on Cannery Row in Monterey, California. In 2007, the Steven Whyte Sculpture Studio and Gallery moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California where it is currently open to the public every day. Nurture from Steven Whyte's signature Stance series, 2003‚Äìongoing  Artistic style  The human form is Whyte's preferred subject, and he typically works with live models whenever possible. His sculptures are ultimately cast in bronze, but they begin as clay. Steven Whyte describes himself as a \\"sculptor of people\\" and although his pieces are reminiscent of classical figures, Whyte chooses to put importance on \\"the emotional quality and impact of the sculpture\\" more than the adherence to traditional technique. Whyte intends for his work to have \\"narrative and tangible personality\\". Whyte currently works in a studio that is open to the public. The interaction and response has become a part of his work. ‚ÄúThere's a constant energy. It's like when a film actor does theater and suddenly there's no distance between his work and the audience, the response is both immediate and honest.‚Äù Public Commissions ‚Ä¢ Congressman John J.

The parish council was formed by the Local Government Act 1894. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The civil parish falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It was fought between the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster loyalists in the area around St Matthew's Roman Catholic church. This lies at the edge of the Short Strand, a Catholic enclave in a mainly-Protestant part of the city. Violence had erupted there, and in other parts of Belfast, following marches by the Orange Order. The battle lasted about five hours and ended at dawn when loyalists withdrew. The British Army and police were deployed nearby but did not intervene. Three people were killed and at least 26 wounded in the fighting, while another three were killed in north Belfast. The battle was the Provisional IRA's first major action during the Troubles,CAIN ‚Äì Chronology of the Conflict ‚Äì June 1970 (see \\"deaths\\" link for information on fatalities) and a propaganda victory for the Irish nationalist organization. It presented itself as having successfully defended a vulnerable Catholic enclave from armed loyalist mobs. Loyalists, however, argue that the IRA lured them into a carefully prepared trap. Background During the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 in Belfast, Catholic Irish republicans clashed with Protestant Ulster loyalists and the mainly-Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland's police force. Catholics believed that they were about to become \\"victims of a Protestant pogrom\\" and Protestants believed they were on the \\"eve of an IRA insurrection\\".Patrick Bishop & Eamonn Mallie. The Provisional IRA. Corgi, 1987. p.103 Hundreds of Catholic homes and businesses were burnt out and more than 1,000 families, mostly Catholic, were forced to flee.Coogan, Tim Pat. The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p.91 The Irish Republican Army (IRA) had few weapons or members and was unable to adequately defend the Catholic areas. The rioting ended with the deployment of British troops. In December 1969, the IRA split into the 'Official' IRA and 'Provisional' IRA‚Äîwith the Provisionals vowing to defend Catholic areas in future. The Short Strand is a Catholic/nationalist enclave in East Belfast, a mainly Protestant/Ulster unionist part of the city. In the early years of the Troubles, Catholics in Short Strand numbered about 6,000, while their Protestant neighbours totalled about 60,000. =Preceding violence= On Saturday 27 June 1970, a large march by the Orange Order took place in west Belfast, which was joined by loyalist bands from other parts of the city. Violence broke out as the march entered the Catholic Springfield Road area on its way to Whiterock Orange Hall. Missiles were thrown by both sides, a bakery was set ablaze, and the British Army fired CS gas to disperse crowds.Mulvenna, Gareth. Tartan Gangs and Paramilitaries: The Loyalist Backlash. Oxford University Press, 2016. pp.69-70 The riot sparked violence in other parts of Belfast.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. pp.49, 50 In north Belfast, another Orange march went along the Crumlin Road, the boundary between the Catholic Ardoyne and the Protestant Shankill areas. According to Crown prosecutors, a crowd emerged from Ardoyne throwing bottles and stones. As the riot descended into a gun-battle, the IRA‚Äîwho according to Gerry Adams were \\"ready and waiting\\"‚Äîkilled three Protestants: William Kincaid (28), Daniel Loughins (32) and Alexander Gould (18). Others were wounded, including a Royal Navy petty officer who was shot in the jaw while driving a field ambulance. Earlier in the month, British troops had diverted an Orange march away from Ardoyne, leading to serious rioting by Protestants in the Shankill.Bardon, Jonathan. A History of Ulster. Black Staff Press, 2001. p.678. In the predominantly Protestant east of the city, an Orange parade had also taken place along the Newtownards Road. At the bottom of the road is the Catholic enclave of the Short Strand, and here there would be a gun battle between the IRA and Protestants, though the cause of it was disputed by both sides. Battle Violence erupted at St Matthew's Catholic church on the evening of 27 June. It began after a loyalist band and supporters marched through the area on their return from the main parade. Rival groups gathered, taunting led to stone-throwing, and eventually shots were fired.Northern Ireland: A report on the conflict by the London Sunday Times Insight Team. Penguin Books, 1972. p.209 As the situation worsened, Catholic residents feared that the gathering crowds of loyalists would attempt to invade the Short Strand and burn them from their homes. Local IRA members retrieved weapons from arms dumps. A young resident, Jim Gibney, recalled: \\"I saw neighbours, people I knew, coming down the street carrying rifles. I was just dumbstruck by this experience. I'd never seen such a thing before\\".Hennessey, Thomas. The evolution of the Troubles, 1970‚Äì72. Irish Academic Press, 2007. pp.33‚Äì35 The battle began at about 10pm and would continue for the next five hours. Loyalists began attacking the church and surrounding property with petrol bombs. A small house in the church grounds, where the sexton lived with his family, was set ablaze. A nearby Catholic pub was also looted and burnt.Geraghty, Tony. The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence. JHU Press, 1998. pp.31‚Äì32 A small group of IRA members and members of the Citizens' Defence Committee took up positions in the church grounds and in adjoining streets. The IRA members were armed with M1 carbines and were led by Billy McKee, commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Also present was Billy Kelly, commander of the Belfast Brigade's 3rd Battalion. The IRA members fired at the loyalists, some of whom were positioned on the roofs opposite. Jim Magee, a local loyalist, said he saw wounded people lying on the road and asked the police (RUC) for help. According to Magee, \\"[they] said 'if you have anything, get it out and protect your people'. So we got an old rifle and went into Frazer Street and started firing back\\".\\"Victims' families in quest for the truth\\". Belfast News Letter. 1 June 2010. The security forces were deployed in the area at the time, but did not intervene to end the fighting. Shortly after the shooting began, Stormont MP Paddy Kennedy went with Short Strand residents to the local RUC base and demanded protection for their homes. Across the River Lagan, in the Markets area, other IRA members assembled and prepared to reinforce the Short Strand should it be invaded. British soldiers eventually arrived in armoured vehicles and cordoned off the roads around the Short Strand, which denied the IRA \\"any hope of reinforcement\\". At the time, the British Army said that its soldiers fired no shots because \\"owing to the confused situation, it was impossible to identify targets\\". British Army Colonel Mike Dewar later said: \\"The whole incident had taken its course because the Army was so chronically overstretched that night in Belfast. The one spare platoon in the whole of west Belfast was not able to get through rioting Protestants to the Short Strand\\".McKittrick, p.50 Journalist Tony Geraghty wrote that sometimes \\"The gunfire eased long enough to allow an occasional British Army personnel carrier (a 'Pig') to whine past, illuminated by the flames in a token gesture of law-and-order\\". Another journalist who witnessed the battle, Peter Taylor, later said: > The shooting intensified but the soldiers still declined to intervene and > separate the two sides ‚Äì either because they felt they were not numerically > strong enough or because they did not wish to get caught up in the middle of > a sectarian fight, in the darkness, with shots being fired by both sides. Liz Maskey, who was a volunteer nurse that night, said that the Short Strand was surrounded by loyalists and claimed they attacked her ambulance as it tried to leave the area. The loyalists withdrew after about five hours, as dawn broke. IRA leader Billy McKee claimed that his unit had fired 800 rounds during the battle. =Casualties= Three people were killed in the fighting. At least 26 were wounded‚Äîincluding Billy McKee, who was shot five times. *Robert Neill, a 38-year-old Protestant,CAIN ‚Äì Sutton Index of Deaths ‚Äì 1970 died instantly when a shot fired from the church bounced off the pavement and hit him in the spine. *James McCurrie, a 34-year-old Protestant, was shot dead on Beechfield Street. *Henry McIlhone, a 33-year-old Catholic, was helping to defend Short Strand when he was accidentally shot from the republican side. He died on 29 June. However, McKee maintains that McIlhone was shot by loyalists. T√≠rghr√°, the IRA's official list of its fallen, lists McIlhone as a \\"volunteer\\" but adds \\"although not a member of the IRA, Henry McIlhone was included in the republican roll of honour as a mark of respect for this great Irishman by republican comrades he fought alongside\\". Aftermath Republicans and loyalists disagree over who started the violence and fired the first shots. Republicans claim that the violence was started by a mob of loyalists returning from an Orange march. They say that the loyalists tried to set the church alight and invade Short Strand, with the intention of burning the residents from their homes. Hence, republicans argue that they were defending the Short Strand from loyalist attack. Loyalists claim the violence was begun by republicans; allegedly when the returning Orangemen and supporters were attacked on Newtownards Road. They argue that republicans attacked Protestants to lure them into \\"a carefully prepared trap\\". The following day, loyalists expelled 500 Catholic workers from the nearby Harland and Wolff shipyard. Shortly after, the British government's representative at Stormont said that the decision to allow Orange marches to go ahead on that day was \\"the greatest single miscalculation I have ever seen made in the course of my life\\". Many Catholics and nationalists believed that the IRA had been unable to defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it in the eyes of many Catholics and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA had been waiting for an opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA. Less than a week later, the British Army seized a large haul of Official IRA weapons during a three-day operation in west Belfast. Nationalists saw this as a confiscation of their defences.

Born in England, she went to Germany to assist Saint Boniface in his missionary labors. Background Sometime after the death of Aldfrith of Northumbria around the year 705, his widow, Cuthburh, the sister of King Ine of Wessex, established a double-monastery in her brother's kingdom at Wimborne in Dorset. St. Richard of Wessex was one of the underkings of the West Saxons, and married to Winna, the sister of St. Boniface.

When Boniface wrote the Abbess Tetta, requesting helpers with his missionary work In Germany, Thecla and Lioba were among those sent.David Farmer, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), 367-8. Boniface seems to have had a threefold purpose in summoning these Anglo-Saxon nuns as his auxiliaries: to propagate the full observance of the Benedictine Rule by new foundations; to introduce it into already founded monasteries, and to restore its observance in others; and finally to bring their gentle influence to bear on the local people, both by example and by the education imparted to their children.Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúSaint Tecla, Virgin and Abbess‚Äù.

The goal of the Southern Gas Corridor is to reduce Europe's dependency on Russian gas and add diverse sources of energy supply. The route from Azerbaijan to Europe consist of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the Trans- Anatolian Pipeline, and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline. The total investment of this route is estimated US$45 billion. The main supply source would be the Shah Deniz gas field, located in the Caspian Sea. The layout of the different pipelines in the Southern Gas Corridor.  History  The European Union is dependent on other countries' supply sources of energy; around 54% of the EU's gross inland energy consumption came from imported sources. Russia has been the main supplier, despite its recent decline, in natural gas, coal and crude oil for a number of years. Russia's dispute with transit countries is a reason for concern regarding the reliance on the country's imports. The initiative was proposed in the European Commission's Communication \\"Second Strategic Energy Review ‚Äì An EU Energy Security and Solidarity Action Plan\\" (COM/2008/781) in 2008. The European Union identified a number of partner countries for this initiative, such as Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Egypt and Mashreq countries. Uzbekistan and Iran should represent, when political conditions permit, a further significant supply source for the EU. There have been numerous conferences revolving around the project. On 8 May 2009, the summit \\"Southern Corridor ‚Äì New Silk Road\\" was held in Prague, addressing the purpose of the corridor. In 2015, a Southern Gas Corridor Conference was hosted at the University of Houston, Texas. Representatives from gas companies, consulates, and other organizational authorities participated in developing relations and calculating productions. The countries that were represented at the conference were the United States, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. The fourth meeting of the ministers within the Southern Gas Corridor Advisory Council was held in Baku on 15 February 2018. Albania and Azerbaijan agreed to establish a new company to create project of the Ionian - Adriatic Pipeline (IAP). SOCAR and Albgaz company of Albania as well as, gas distributing companies of some countries such as Montenegro, Croatia and Albania signed two documents related to design of new pipelines. This project will connect to the Southern Gas Corridor. The opening ceremony of the Southern Gas Corridor took place at the Sangachal Terminal with the participation of Ilham Aliyev on 29 May 2018. The opening ceremony of the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline took place in Eskisehir, Turkey with the participation of Presidents of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Ukraine on 12 June 2018.  Technical description  In the Trans-European Networks ‚Äì Energy (TEN‚ÄìE) program, the European Union designated three of the pipelines as of strategic importance (ITGI, Nabucco and White Stream).\\" Also the Trans Adriatic Pipeline was identified that time as a Southern Corridor project. It was planned that the Southern Corridor projects could provide the necessary transportation capacity to deliver of Caspian and Central Asian gas directly to Europe.Joshua Chaffin, EU plan to loosen Russia's grip on energy, Financial Times, 13 November 2008. As of 2017, the corridor would pass through Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Italy and consists of three main projects: * the South Caucasus Pipeline extension (SCPx) through Azerbaijan and Georgia; * the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) through Turkey; * the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) through Greece, Albania, and Italy. This combination of these pipelines will be nearly long. The total cost of these projects is estimated $45 billion. There are other projects which fall under the SGC: * The Shah Deniz 2 Development in the Caspian Sea; * Expansion of the gas transmission network in Italy; * Expansion of processing plant at Sangachal Terminal. The project's current reserves are approximately 1.2 trillion cubic meters of gas and 2.2 billion barrels of condensate. Financing =European Investment Bank= On 6 February 2018, The European Investment Bank (EIB) voted to hand out EUR 1.5 Billion, one of Europe's largest ever loans, to one of the EU's largest fossil fuel projects, the contentious Trans Adriatic Pipeline. The loan approval follows the release of a study last week demonstrating that the Southern Gas Corridor ‚Äì of which TAP is a part ‚Äì could be as emissions-intensive or even more so than coal power. A document obtained via a freedom of information request revealed that the European Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action and the Vice President of the European Commission in charge of the Energy Union have been lobbying the EIB to green-light loans to TAP and the eastern section of the Southern Gas Corridor, the Trans Anatolian Pipeline. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. =Involvement of other financial institutions and stakeholders= The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) already approved three loans for the Shah Deniz stage 2 gas field (US$200 million, US$250 million and US$100 million) as well as a US$500 million loan for TANAP, and stated its financial support to TAP could amount to EUR 1.2 billion. On top of US$250 million for Shah Deniz stage II (as part of a package with the EBRD and commercial banks), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved in December 2016 an additional US$1 billion for the Shah Deniz II gas field. The World Bank approved two US$400 million loans for Turkey and Azerbaijan for TANAP. The World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) approved a guarantee of up to US$950 million for TANAP against the risk of non-honoring of a sovereign financial obligation. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) approved a US$600 million loan for TANAP at an unannounced extraordinary virtual Board meeting on 21 December. (The AIIB's project summary also states the combined EIB and EBRD support for TANAP as US$2.1 billion, which suggests that, like the EIB, the EBRD is considering EUR 1 billion for TANAP.) 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. Currently, the Azerbaijani government (Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Azerbaijan) owns 51% of the Southern Gas Corridor; the other 49% is owned by State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). The World Bank has supplied a $400 million loan to BP, a major shareholder and operator of Shah Deniz JV. The Asian Development Bank has also stated its planned financing of $600 million towards TANAP. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is thinking about making a 2 million euro contribution towards the TAP.  Controversies  = Gas demand = Between 2010 and 2015, gas demand in the European Union has decreased more than 20%. At the same time, gas projects are evaluated with a more than 70% higher gas demand scenario in 2030. Since 2015 to 2017, there has been an increase in gas consumption, but only by 7%. The EU has an overall surplus of gas import infrastructure and many of import capacities are underutilized. On the other hand, the EU goals for energy efficiency would reduce gas demand in the next years. The EU has set itself a 20% energy savings target by 2020 when compared to the projected use of energy in 2020. = European Climate Policy = The key targets of the EU on climate policy by 2030 are at least 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1990, 27% of total energy consumption from renewable energy and 27% increase in energy efficiency. According to the International Energy Agency, \\"no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 ¬∞C goal\\". The European Investment Bank has stated its commitment to combat climate change, yet is still aiming to finance the corridor which may hinder the process of decarbonization. = Diversification = With the SGC, one of the goals on the EU is to diversify natural gas supply routes and reduce dependency from Russia. Russia supplied about one third of the EU gas consumption in 2013, mainly through Gazprom. However, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is to lend US$200 million to Lukoil to develop the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan. The Russian company Lukoil, whose CEO is an Azerbaijani businessman Vagit Alekperov, owns 10% of the field. = Supporting the Azerbaijani government = Building SGC, European countries and companies support gas export from Azerbaijan and contribute to finance Azerbaijan's government. The regime is considered by many NGOs and watchdogs organizations as repressive and activists and journalists are regularly arrested on false charges and imprisoned. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) wrote in 2015, that \\"for more than a decade Azerbaijan has made shameless use of caviar diplomacy to charm European governments, its most important oil and gas clients\\". The CEE BankWatch warns that \\"Developing Shah Deniz stage 2 and the Southern Gas Corridor is likely to cement further the oppressive structures of the Aliyev government\\". According to the reports prepared by European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center (ESISC) on March and April 2017, the publication of such information serves to create a climate against some countries including Azerbaijan to benefit Armenia which is led by different NGO's and its connections within the Council of Europe. In these reports, such activities of that Armenian connection are regarded as unilateral and biased hiding private interests of the network behind the purview of the defense of human rights, but the activity of the ESISC itself is characterized as a part of the Azerbaijani propaganda (see European strategic intelligence and security center). The Azerbaijani government has been investigated by more than 10 European media organizations and was accused of laundering money to the United Kingdom. The \\"Azerbaijani Laundromat\\" consisted of sending 2.5 billion euros to European politician and Azerbaijani elites; the money was also used to purchase luxury goods. One of the reasons why the laundering took place was because the Azerbaijani government needed to keep a positive image in Europe to gain support for the Southern Gas Corridor. The corridor is a main reason for the laundering and can explain the government's heavy lobbying at the European level. As a result of the scandal, more than 80 human right activists and opposing politicians were arrested and jailed.  Outside opinion and protests  The Southern Gas Corridor has gotten mixed reactions from the public, and has been the target of many protests and petitions around the world. In Italy, there have been protests concerning the corridor and its damage to the environment. In March 2017, environmentalists protested against the removal of historical olive groves; this centuries-old grove was blocking the path of the TAP. Protesters blocked the construction site to prevent trucks and supplies from entering. Police involvement was involved, and broke up 300 protesters. More than 60 olive trees have already been removed since the protest, to the locals' dismay. More than 25 NGOs have also written a letter to the EIB Board of Directors and the bank's president, asking for the European Investment Bank to stop funding the TANAP due to the human rights violations the project has caused. The letter states that the Azerbaijani government has used forms of torture, imprisonment, and disruption to protesters, journalists, and other politicians; human rights monitors have also not been able to enter Azerbaijan.

The history of rail transport in Estonia starts in 1870 when a line was opened connecting Paldiski, Tallinn, Tapa and Narva; the line extending all the way to St. Petersburg in Russia.  Beginnings of Estonian railways in Imperial Russia  The first railway line to be built in Estonia was the Paldiski ‚Äì Tallinn ‚Äì Narva ‚Äì Gatchina line constructed in 1870; Baltic German nobility provided the impetus for the construction of the line, though because of the Russian influence the line was built to 1524mm (5 ft) gauge to connect with the line from St. Petersburg to Warsaw . The construction project was controlled by the Russian Ministry of Roads. The port of Paldiski was chosen because its southerly position made it ice free all the year round. Soon after both Paldiski and Tallinn experienced an upswing in trade, notably exports of grain. In 1877 another line was complete, connecting Tapa and Tartu; later extended to Valga in 1887, which brought a connection to Latvia via the Pskov ‚Äì Valga ‚Äì Riga line also being constructed at the same time. Additionally a network of narrow gauge railways (750mm) were being built in Estonia, the first connecting Valga and P√§rnu in 1896, then M√µisak√ºla to Viljandi (1897), later extended via Paide to Tallinn in 1901. Railways in the republic of Estonia (1918‚Äì1940) Karuse railway station (built in 1928) on the former narrow-gauge Rapla‚ÄìVirtsu line At the end of World War I and the collapse of the Russian Empire, the country was occupied by Germany and a puppet government installed. This subsequently collapsed with German defeat in World War I and Estonia became a republic in 1918. Finally, after the expulsion of invading Soviet forces during the Estonian War of Independence, Estonia became a recognised independent republic in 1920. At the time of its creation, the railways had 648 km of broad gauge and 187 km of narrow gauge track and 90 broad gauge locomotives, 72 narrow gauge locomotives plus rolling stock. Thus the railways of Estonia became known as Eesti Raudtee (EVR), formed from the Looderaudtee (North-Western Railway), Esimese Juurdeveoteede Selts (First Association of Approach Tracks) as well as military and other railway lines. One consequence of the new independence was that the railway architecture did not have to follow the imperial style set out in St. Petersburg - architectural trends followed those in other parts of the world - with neo-baroque styles with romantic-vernacular elements giving way to functionalist architecture in the 1930s. In 1931, a 1524mm gauge line opened between Tartu and Petseri. By 1940, the EVR had 772 km of broad gauge and 675 km of narrow gauge track. Railways in the Estonian SSR (1940‚Äì1991) In June 1940, Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Union becoming the Estonian SSR; EVR became part of the Russian rail system again, the country was invaded by Nazi Germany and occupied by German forces between 1941 and 1944. During German occupation the network was converted to standard (1435mm) gauge, and rolling stock from Germany used. After the end of the Second World War, Estonia was once again part of the Soviet Union and the railways were run as part of the Soviet Union's rail network; the track was converted back to broad gauge. Lagedi‚ÄìMuuga line, built in mid-1980s together with the Port of Muuga. Much infrastructure was destroyed during the war and as a consequence many station buildings are in the neo-classicist style (see Stalinist architecture) having been rebuilt in the post war years. Soviet planning placed the emphasis on broad gauge track and much freight formerly transported on narrow gauge lines was moved by road, lines were also converted to broad gauge. Starting in 1957, steam locomotives began to be replaced by diesel locomotives. Though the narrow gauge lines were closed the broad gauge sections prospered: in 1945 passenger numbers were 12.2 million, freight volumes 4.3million tonnes. The railway network became part of the Pribaltiiskaya RailwayOne of the fifteen zones of the Soviet rail network - the Pribaltiiskaya part included the rail networks of the Baltic states. New broad gauge lines were built in the 1960s replacing some of the narrow gauge lines while some others were closed.All the Edelaraudtee lines are on former narrow gauge track The last public narrow gauge line closed in June 1973. In 1980, 36.5 million passengers were being carried The construction of a new port at Muuga (north-east of Tallinn) began in 1986, as part of that project new the railway link between Tallinn and Tapa was updated. In 1990, 30.1 million tonnes of freight carried; the new port contributing significantly to this figure. Railways in Estonia (1991‚Äì) Estonia began moving towards a second independence in 1988, and by 1991 was recognised as an independent state. On 1 January 1992 Eesti Raudtee (EVR) came into being as a state owned company. =Privatisation= As part of a privatisation plan EVR became Estonian Railways Ltd. in 1997 with the state controlling 100% of the shares. Three organisations were formed in 1997-1998 for future privatisation: *In 1997 Edelaraudtee AS for diesel powered internal regional trains serving the lines Tallinn‚ÄìTartu, Tallinn‚ÄìRakvere‚ÄìNarva, Tallinn‚ÄìRapla, Tallinn‚ÄìT√ºri‚ÄìViljandi, Tallinn‚ÄìP√§rnu and Tartu‚ÄìP√µlva‚ÄìOrava., and freight on the Tallinn-P√§rnu-M√µisak√ºla and Lelle-Viljandi lines. *In 1998 Elektriraudtee AS for electric 'mass-transit' trains in Tallinn and the surrounding Harju County. *In 1998 EVR-Ekspress - operating international long distance traffic. (renamed GoRail in 2004 privatisation) In 2001 a 66% stake in EVR was acquired for $58 million by Baltic Rail Services (BRS). Whilst under private ownership many second hand American built GE locomotives were introduced. In 2007 EVR was re-nationalised and the company became 100% state owned again. =Future= In 2004 Estonia joined the European union - for rail transport this has clear consequences, an EU directive of 1991 (EU Directive 91/440) suggested the separation of railway operation structure into track, and train operators with the intention of encouraging or allowing new railway operators to be able to run trains on other companies tracks (\\"de-monopolisation or railways\\"), a related directive extends the encouragement of competition to inter-state railway operations. For the railways of Estonia this means the possibility of new companies operating on Estonian railways such as the Haapsalu Raudtee which sees restarting passenger operations on the Haapsalu line as a possible option, and increased competition from other railways, such as the Russian company SeverStal.

The establishment lost its leading role on the deaths of Louis and then Maintenon, but it nevertheless marked an evolution in female education under the Ancien R√©gime. Its notable students included Maintenon's niece Marthe-Marguerite Le Valois de Villette de Mursay, marquise de Caylus, and Napoleon's sister √âlisa Bonaparte, grand duchess of Tuscany. It remained in existence during the first years of the French Revolution, but closed for good in March 1793, with its empty buildings being taken over by the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1808. However, the Maison royale later provided Napoleon with the inspiration for his Maison des demoiselles de la L√©gion d'honneur, which still exists as the Maison d'√©ducation de la L√©gion d'honneur. History Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, Marquise de Maintenon =Maintenon's wishes= The origins of the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis were strongly linked to the youth of Madame de Maintenon. She was herself from a noble family which had fallen on hard times; she received only a limited education, administered via the convents, which were then the only institutions educating noble girls.Jacques Pr√©vot, La premi√®re institutrice de France : Madame de Maintenon Their curricula were minimal, with lessons in French, Latin, mathematics and domestic work. The main emphasis was on religion and liturgy, with no opening onto the real world. Madame de Maintenon later moved in intellectual circles, thanks to her first husband, Scarron, before becoming governess to the children of Madame de Montespan, giving her exposure to education and a vocation as an educator. Once beside Louis XIV, de Maintenon wished to improve the education available to girls from impoverished noble families, who were becoming increasingly numerous because many provincial noblemen died in Louis's wars or expended their fortunes in his service. = Founding = In 1680, Madame de Maintenon took on two nuns, the former ursuline Madame de Brinon and her relation Madame de Saint-Pierre, who was the head of a small school established to train poor girls for jobs in domestic service. In 1686 she set the nuns up in a house at Rueil which she had rented and fitted out.√âric Le Nabour, La Marquise de Maintenon - L'√©pouse secr√®te de Louis XIV She added twenty girls from poor noble families to students drawn from among the people, who were taught a different curriculum. In 1684 the Maison Royale was visited by the Chinese Catholic convert Michael Shen Fu-Tsung. Also that year, on 3 February 1684, the school for daughters of impoverished noble families was moved to Noisy-le- Roi, with help from the king, who offered the Ch√¢teau de Noisy, acquiring it and fitting it out to house more than 180 'pensionnaires'.Fran√ßoise Chandernagor, L'All√©e du Roi On 15 August 1684, in Grand Conseil, Louis XIV decreed the founding of Plan of the ground floor of the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis. The domaine of Saint-Cyr was assigned to the Maison in 1685, and the king ordered major building work on the domaine next to Versailles, led by Jules Hardouin Mansart. The project cost the king 1,400,000 livres. Hardouin- Mansart's designs for the Maison used the U-shaped plan he often used elsewhere, with the buildings reserved for the mistresses and students forming an H, to which the school chapel had to be added to the west. The classrooms and students' dormitories were on the first and second floors respectively, the dormitories just above the classrooms for the corresponding classes. Each dormitory held 40 beds and was surrounded by two cells for the mistresses. Each classroom was also juxtaposed with a small supplementary dormitory with 20 beds, itself next to two cells for the mistresses. The infirmary was sited away from the dormitories to allow the sick to be isolated and thus avoid the spread of contagious diseases. The rooms reserved for pensionnaires were situated to the east of the buildings, to put them as far as possible from the visitor entrance, situated to the west at the level of the external courtyard. In June 1686, after 15 months of work, Louis XIV gave the domaine to the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis, in letters patent of 18 and 26 June 1686 confirming the founding of the establishment.Jean-Paul Desprat, Madame de Maintenon (1635-1719), ou le prix de la r√©putation From 26 July to 1 August 1686, the pensionnaires, known as the \\"Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr\\", entered the establishment in a grand procession thanks to Louis, who lent them his carriages and his Swiss guards. Madame de Brinon was made the institution's superior for life, and Madame de Maintenon was given the title of \\"Institutrice de la Maison Royale de Saint-Louis\\", which gave her total authority over the Maison. The king also granted her an apartment at Saint-Cyr which she could use when she wished. The school's chapel was consecrated to Our Lady on 2 August that year and the relics of St Candide, previously held at the chapel of Noisy, were transferred there. The king made his first visit to Saint-Cyr in September 1686, when he was welcomed by the ladies and pensionnaires in a major ceremony. Major figures became interested in the foundation of the Maison Royale. At the start of 1687, Fontenelle, competing for an eloquence prize at the Acad√©mie, sang of \\"les Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr\\" and \\"[their] famous model of beauty united with innocence.\\" =Organisation= Two \\"Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr\\". The Maison Royale de Saint-Louis was opened \\"to the daughters of gentlemen who have been killed or exhausted their health or their fortune in the service of the State\\", who would enter the school aged between 7 and 12. The king himself decided on who the school admitted, after consulting with experts on French genealogy who could guarantee that applicants possessed at least four generations of noble birth on their father's side. Many pensionnaires were daughters, nieces or orphans of soldiers and, though many of them were from Paris and its outskirts, the school had students from every province of FranceList of students at Saint-Cyr by d√©partement - from the archives of the Conseil g√©n√©ral des Yvelines and even from abroad (e.g., three Qu√©b√©coises in the 1750s). The school buildings housed 250 students, cared for by 36 female educators or \\"professes\\", 24 \\"converses\\" sisters carrying out domestic tasks, some priests, and lay personnel. The students, aged 7 to 20, were divided by age into four \\"classes\\". They wore a uniform in the form of a brown muslin robe akin to court robes, tied with ribbons whose colour indicated the wearer's class‚Äîred for 7 to 10 years old; green for 11 to 14; yellow for 15-16; and blue for 17-20. They also wore a white bonnet which left their hair partly uncovered. Each class had its own room.Register of the \\"red class\\" - archives of the Conseil g√©n√©ral des Yvelines. This uniform and division by age were echoed in Noisy: Each class was headed by a \\"ma√Ætresse de classe\\", who was herself supported by a second mistress and sub-mistresses. Some of the oldest and most talented students were deputised for these mistresses and wore black ribbons. Indeed, the role of the \\"blacks\\" was wider. Chosen from among the most talented and disciplined of the \\"blues\\", they were in charge of helping the teachers and in the hospital, refectory, accounts, etc.Jacques Pr√©vot, La premi√®re institutrice de France: Madame de Maintenon The class mistresses were led by a \\"Ma√Ætresse g√©n√©rale des classes\\", who not only coordinated the different classes but also had responsibility for the students outside of school hours. The mistresses and other ladies were not nuns but took \\"simples\\" or temporary religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, as well as vows to \\"devote their life to the education and instruction of the demoiselles\\", which Madame de Maintenon judged to be the most important vow of all. They were uniformly dressed in black muslin, with a black bonnet. The students were housed at Saint-Cyr until they reached 20 and were not supposed to leave it until that age, unless in cases of dismissal, marriage or \\"exceptional family circumstances.\\" When they left the school at the end of their studies, they received a dowry of 3,000 livres either for a suitable marriage or to allow them to enter a convent. However, some ex-students did not leave and remained there as teachers. To guarantee the quality of teaching, students who wished to become teachers followed a \\"noviciate\\" of 6 years during which they were trained in teaching by the \\"Ma√Ætresse des novices\\". The revenues to maintain the establishment came from rents and exploitation of its domaines, subsidies from the G√©n√©ralit√© de Paris and revenues of the Abbaye de Saint-Denis to which it was attached. = Teaching = Rules of the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis. The school's rules, often called les Constitutions, stated in article 54 \\"what to teach young ladies\\":Exhibition on the Maison Royale Each class had a timetable appropriate to its students' age: * the \\"reds\\" learned reading, writing, arithmetic and geometry, receiving their first lessons in the catechism and the rudiments of religious history and Latin *the \\"greens\\" continued in these subjects, along with history and geography *the \\"yellows\\" also learned drawing, singing, dance and music *the \\"blues\\" were initiated into heraldry, the history of the Catholic Church and more detailed teaching in morality All the pensionnaires' days played out according to the same timetable : they got up at 6am and went to their classrooms at 7 with the first prayers of the days, before having their morning meal in the refectory. They then studied from 8 until 12 before having lunch. The lunch break lasted until 2pm, when classes began again. These lasted until 6pm, when they had supper. They finally went to bed at 9pm. Each moment of the day was punctuated by a prayer. This timetable was shorter than that of most convents, where students had to get up at 4am for Matins. Helping in the domestic tasks at the Maison Royale formed part of the students' education. The eldest, especially the \\"blues\\" and \\"blacks\\", had to assist at the refectory or the infirmary, or sewing clothes and dresses for their fellow students or the teachers. Their leisure time was also important and Madame de Maintenon encouraged the students to use them for intellectual games such as chess and checkers, though card games were banned. The 1709 M√©moires des Dames de Saint-Cyr wrote that: According to the wishes of Madame de Maintenon, the education provided at Saint-Cyr was different from that traditionally practiced in convents, where education was minimal and principally centred on religion. The Maison's students were educated to be the future wives and ladies of the nobility, receiving an education that was severe but showed proof of the era's modernity, in particular in its refusal to neglect secular education to make time for religious education. The arts were also taught at Saint-Cyr ‚Äî in particular theatre, which Madame de Maintenon appreciated - when convents generally did not teach these things, disapproving of actors. The personnel of the Maison were lay and not religious, which was unique for the era. This uniqueness did not prevent the Maison from imposing strict discipline - its students had no holidays and were not allowed to see their families more than four times a year, in the parlour. The dormitories were not heated, the beds were voluntarily hard in order not to 'soften' the pensionnaires, and they washed in cold water only. From 1698, Madame de Maintenon made unprecedented modifications to the Maison - each class was no longer placed entirely under the leadership of its mistresses, but split up into \\"families\\" of eight to ten students, each with a \\"mother\\", generally the eldest student in the group, and made the responsibility of one of the class mistresses. Each family had a banked semi-circular bench, with the students placed around the convex part and the mistress at the centre: = Controversy over Racine's Esther = Racine puts on a repeat performance of Esther by the students of Saint-Cyr in the presence of Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon. The students at Saint-Cyr first learned theatre in plays written by Madame de Brinon, then in the Conversations written for them by Madame de Maintenon on different moral subjects. They then played in tragedies by Corneille and Racine. However, Madame de Maintenon was unhappy to see the Demoiselles playing scenes of amorous passion with too much ardour, and so Racine wrote the students a religious piece, Esther, which Madame de Maintenon planned to put on before the king and court. This gave rise to a deep dispute between Madame de Maintenon and Madame de Brinon, with the latter opposed to a production that she suspected was only for Madame de Maintenon's own glory. This dispute was not new - since 1687, Madame de Brinon frequently reproached Madame de Maintenon for being around the establishment too much and imposing on Madame de Brinon, its superior. Being its superior for life, Madame de Brinon could not be replaced, but a lettre de cachet sealed on 10 December 1688 allowed the play to be put on. Madame de Loubert, previously secretary to Madame de Maintenon and aged only 22, replaced Madame de Brinon as secretary on 19 May 1689. Esther was premiered on 26 January 1689 at Saint-Cyr in the presence of Louis XIV, Madame de Maintenon and many other courtiers. The girls who acted in the play, mostly \\"blues\\", received from Madame de Maintenon costumes decorated with diamonds and precious stones and, moreover, : The sets were designed by Borin, the set designer of the court spectacles, and the play's music was played by the king's musicians. The preparations for the production cost a total of more than 14,000 livres. There were four more productions of the play in February 1690, with the last on 19 February. Marguerite de Villette, aged 16 and recently married to the marquis de Caylus, played the r√¥le of Esther. The production's success was important to the king and his courtiers, so much so that they considered a great honour to be invited to it. However it quickly displeased Madame de Maintenon, who feared that the school's students would fall prey to courtiers and above all that the production would make them too proud: = Further controversy = View of the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis at the start of the 18th century. After the production of Esther, Madame de Maintenon thought of cancelling all plays at Saint-Cyr, but the king demanded that they put on Racine's new play, Athalie - their production began on 5 January 1691 and took place in an atmosphere of great discretion, with no costume other than the Saint-Cyr uniforms and in the presence of nobody but the royal family, except for 22 January when they were joined by James and Mary (former king and queen of England), F√©nelon and some bishops. The two guides of Madame de Maintenon's conscience, F√©nelon and abb√© Godet des Marais (who had become bishop of Chartres), demanded she renounce glory and return to Saint-Cyr its \\"humility and simplicity\\". The school's discipline became stricter, with bans on coquetterie and on books that had at first been allowed into Saint-Cyr but were now judged to be too profane for it. Madame de Maintenon also recommended that teachers should not hesitate to punish students and contain their pride, stating: She also demanded that all males except priests be banned from the Maison, with even priests only allowed to meet the students in the confessional. =Conversion to a convent= The church and the Jansenists condemned the production of Esther and the lack of discipline which seemed to reign at Saint-Cyr, adding that girls' education should not be entrusted to lay people. Moreover, it was held to be incongruous that the Maison was a secular house, not a convent, and yet was financed by revenues from the Abbaye de Saint-Denis. Although neither Madame de Maintenon nor the king wanted the Maison to become a convent, she admitted that her attempt at secular education at Saint-Cyr had failed and accepted its transformation into a convent. Thus, in November 1692, the pope pronounced the extinction of the abbatial title of Saint-Denis, and the Maison's transformation into a convent was decided on in September 1692 ‚Äì the pope's request was made via Godet des Marais: The conversion became effective from 1 December and the teachers were given the choice between taking solemn vows and thus becoming nuns, and leaving the Maison altogether. From 1692 to 1694, mother Priolo, from the Chaillot convent, was put in charge of their teaching during their time as novices. At the start of 1694, Madame de Loubert was replaced by Madame de Fontaines, but Madame de Maintenon - more and more present at Saint-Cyr ‚Äì was recognised as honorary superior in spiritual and temporal charge of the Maison. The Maison then found itself right at the heart of the quietism affair, when Madame Guyon, who was linked in friendship with Madame de Maintenon and welcomed at Saint-Cyr by her from 1689. The example of her ecstasies very quickly influenced the students, worrying Madame de Maintenon - moreover, she was being roundly criticised by the jansenists, who accused her of allowing heretical thoughts to spread. She ended by sending the mystic away from Saint-Cyr in 1694, before separating herself from F√©nelon (who still supported Madame Guyon) in 1696 and withdrawing his books from the Maison. Finally, in 1698, she sent down the last adepts of quietism still present at Saint-Cyr, Madame de la Maisonfort, cousin of Madame Guyon, and Madame du Tourp, putting an end to the quietism affair at Saint-Cyr: =Closure= Marguerite de Guillermin, last abbess of Saint Cyr. On the death of Louis XIV in 1715, Madame de Maintenon retired to Saint-Cyr until her death on 15 April 1719. She was embalmed and buried in the school chapel on 18 August. The Maison continued to function with great discretion, though the death of Madame de Maintenon and the succession of Louis XIV by his great- grandson Louis XV took away the school's fashionable status. Even so, on 6 September 1715, the regent had visited Madame de Maintenon at Saint-Cyr and guaranteed her that all the privileges acquired by the Maison would be maintained. Under Louis XV, in the absence of Madame de Maintenon, the new ideas of the Maison weakened and the education it provided was criticised,Rebecca Rogers, Les demoiselles de la L√©gion d'honneur at first by Louis XV himself in the 1730s - he refused to send his daughters to Saint-Cyr. The M√©moires of Madame du Hausset (Paris, 1824) stated \\"These girls are prudes. (...) They are taught a manner that would make them all ladies of the palace, or they are unhappy and impertinent\\". In 1750, the marquis d'Argenson even affirmed \\"We know the establishment at Saint-Cyr is good for nothing. It produces nothing but prudes, who only marry in their provinces or are made to enrage their husbands.Journal et m√©moires du marquis d'Argenson In 1786, √âlisabeth de France, sister of Louis XVI, celebrated the centenary of the Maison Royale de Saint-Louis, and a firework display was put on in its courtyard,History of Saint-Cyr, 1692/1786 though Louis XVI did not attend in person, watching it from the terraces at Versailles. The French Revolution and in particular its abolition of the clergy's and nobility's privileges put the Maison's raison d'√™tre into doubt. In compensation, a decree of Louis XVI in 1790 authorised the school to admit non-noble girls, but the Legislative Assembly decreed on the school's closure on 16 August 1792, effective from March 1793 with the departure of its personnel and remaining students. From October 1793, the buildings were turned into a military hospital and remained so until 1798. Later, in 1808, when its original buildings proved too small, Napoleon moved his √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr there, taking over the old buildings of the Maison Royale, where it remained until the Second World War. Since the second half of the 20th century the buildings of the Maison have been restored and now house the Lyc√©e militaire de Saint-Cyr.  Influences  Even in the lifetime of Madame de Maintenon, many establishments were set up or transformed on the model of the Maison, generally by the Maison's former students. In 1705 one of those students, Madame de la Viefville or Viesville, aged only 28, became abbess of the Bernardine convent at Gomerfontaine, in the diocese of Beauvais, near Trie (present day Trie- Ch√¢teau). She had joined a convent at Argensol on leaving the Maison and the first thing she did on her appointment as abbess was to ask Madame de Maintenon her opinions and for the honour of her protection, in reply to which she began by her sending her Mademoiselle d'Aumale \\"to help better raise her students and assist in her councils\\".Instruction from Madame de Maintenon to Mademoiselle d'Aumale in sending her to Gomerfontaine (1705), cited in La premi√®re institutrice de France : Madame de Maintenon In 1712, Madame de la Mairie, another alumna of Saint-Cyr, reformed the convent at Bisy on advice from Madame de Maintenon, who wrote to de la Mairie in May that year: Both Viefville and Mairie made their establishments give a similar education to that of the Maison, and many other alumnae also became teachers, whilst other alumnae entered convents and passed on the Maison's teaching methods at ground level in all the major convents, which began to take more account of their pupils' teaching and wellbeing rather than putting religious education above all else.

Born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, he attended Grange Grammar School and obtained a scholarship to study at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. His studies were interrupted by World War II, during which he was a navigator in the RAF. After national service, part of which was spent in India, he read English at Leeds University, with a master's thesis on the Lincolnshire dialect. He worked as principal researcher under Harold Orton on the four volume Survey of English Dialects. Ellis performed much of the field work this entailed, and many of his recordings and interviews are housed in the Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture. He went on to be a lecturer and senior lecturer in the School of English at Leeds.http://campus.leeds.ac.uk/newsincludes/newsitem6698.htm He was the first person to provide expert evidence for speaker identification in an English court,Jack Windsor Lewis, Obituary: Stanley Ellis, The Guardian, 13 November 2009The Yorkshire Ripper Hoax Tape and in June 1979, he correctly identified that a tape released by police that purported to be from the Yorkshire Ripper was by a hoaxer (nicknamed Wearside Jack by the press), as the accent was that of someone from an area a significant distance from the crime scene. However, the police disregarded his warning.\\"In the News\\", The Reporter, issue 511 (University of Leeds newsletter) The hoaxer was finally identified in 2006, and shown to have lived his life in the region Ellis had identified. His colleague on the case and in university, Jack Windsor Lewis, said in November 2012 that Ellis had located the speaker to the Wearside area by comparing his speech with that of a recording made whilst studying the dialect of Washington, but dismissed the reports that Ellis located him as precisely as Castletown.The Higgins Boast, Jack Windsor Lewis, 10 November 2012 After taking early retirement from his university post, Ellis continued to provide linguistic expertise as an expert witness in court cases. From the 1980s, he presented a series of programmes on dialect for BBC Radio 4, entitled \\"Take a Place Like ...\\" and \\"Talk of the Town, Talk of the Country\\", and later was a host of radio phone-ins, discussing dialect and origins of names and placenames with callers, as well as contributing to programmes such as The Routes of English.BBC - Radio 4 - Routes of English In Talking for Britain: A Journey Through the Nation's Dialects (2005), Simon Elmes paid tribute to Ellis: 'Stanley's deep linguistic wisdom and his love of the British landscape - the people who live in it and who describe it in their talk - inspired me to pursue my own long fascination' (p. x).

He graduated from Princeton in 1848, and then studied chemistry at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard. In 1851 he became instructor at the Yale (now Sheffield) Scientific School, and from 1853 to 1855 he was chemist to the geological survey of New Jersey. He was chosen professor of chemistry at the Medical college in Kingston, Canada in 1857, and a year later accepted a similar chair at the National Medical College in Washington, D. C.. At the same time he was examiner in the chemical division of the United States Patent Office until 1861. Later, Prof. Wurtz moved to New York. His original work included: *the discovery of the mineral hisingerite in America (1850); *the invention of methods for the production of alum from greensand marl and potassium chloride and potassium sulphate from similar sources (1850); *methods of preparing pure alkalies and alkaline earths (1852); *applications of sodium amalgams (1865); *new modes of manufacture of fuel gas by the alternating action of air and steam on cheap coal (1869); *the production of magnesia by precipitation from sea-water by means of calcium hydroxide (1877); *the discovery of the minerals animikite and huntilite (1878); *a new method of concentrating and caking granular materials of all kinds by mixing with small percentages of metallic iron and a solution of ferrous sulphate (1882), and *a new method of distilling coal to obtain liquid products. Wurtz was engaged until 1888 in perfecting processes by means of which greater yields of the heavy paraffin oils, paraffin wax, carbolic acid, and other products can be obtained from coals of all kinds more quickly, also in developing the generation of electricity by methods the chemical products of which will be of sufficient value to pay all costs. Prof. Wurtz entered the employ of Thomas A. Edison as chemist in October, 1888. In 1876 he served as a judge on the international jury of awards at the World's fair in Philadelphia, making a special report on The Chemistry of Japan Porcelain and Porcelain Minerals, and in 1877 the degree of Ph. D. was conferred on him by Stevens Institute of Technology. From 1868 till 1874 he was editor of the American Gas-Light Journal, and he was assistant editor in the chemical department of Johnson's Universal Cyclop√¶dia. He has made numerous reports to various corporations, and is the author of about sixty scientific memoirs. The mineral Wurtzilite was named after him by Professor George Frederick Kunz.

The front range light. The Hyannis Rear Range Light, also known as the Hyannis Harbor Light, was a lighthouse and, for part of its life, one of a pair of range lights adjacent to Hyannis Harbor. The Range Rear tower was built in 1849 and equipped with a 5th order Fresnel lens in 1856. In 1863 the original birdcage lantern was replaced with a new cast iron one. In 1885, a front range light was added on the Old Colony Railroad Wharf, and the two lights together served to leading vessels to the wharf. The 20 foot Range Rear tower is shorter than most lighthouses, as its purpose was just to guide ships to the wharf. In the early 1800s, the railroad extended from its current terminus at the Hyannis Transportation Center, down what is now Old Colony Road (named after the railroad) to Harbor Road, where it ended in the 300 foot wharf that was a busy area for shipping coal, lumber, grain and fish. Over time, as the channel into the adjacent Lewis Bay was dredged deeper, there was a shift of traffic into Lewis Bay and Hyannis inner harbor, and the wharf fell into disuse. The lights were discontinued in 1929 and the front range light has disappeared along with the wharf, although the outline of the wharf can still be seen in aerial photographs. The lantern was removed from the rear light before it was sold. In 1987 a new, much larger lantern room was added to the top of the tower by local carpenter Theodore Ingemanson. The lighthouse is now privately owned but can be seen on Google Street view or directly from Harbor Road in Hyannis.

Clubs are established in churches and other Christian organizations and allow women to mentor girls as they develop a living, dynamic relationship with Jesus. GEMS, which stands for \\"Girls Everywhere Meeting the Savior\\", was founded in 1958 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by Barbara Vredevoogd and has since grown to become an international ministry with 5,200 women serving over 23,000 girls in more than 800 clubs in the United States, Canada, Zambia, Kenya, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda, China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and The Bahamas. History In 1957, the Young Calvinist Federation decided there was a mounting need to design a ministry specifically for young girls. Barb Vredevoogd, a member of Beverly Christian Reformed Church in Wyoming, Michigan, was invited to expand the club program she had designed for local girls, in order to offer the curriculum to other churches as well. Vredevoogd then became the first acting director, and the program ‚Äì originally known as Calvinettes ‚Äì began to flourish. In 1966, GEMS (formerly \\"Calvinettes\\"), the Calvinist Cadet Corps, and Youth Unlimited (then the Young Calvinist Federation) merged to form Dynamic Youth Ministries (then known as United Calvinist Youth). In 2006, GEMS expanded its global vision to reach girls everywhere by organizing clubs in Africa. Since then, girls in clubs across North America have been active in assisting the efforts. New curriculum has been developed, a micro-financing program has started, and construction has started the Esther School for orphans and under-resourced children in Zambia. GEMS Girls' Clubs is governed by an executive board that oversees general policies, finances, and the overall effectiveness of the ministry. Program levels Most local churches divide their GEMS programs into three age levels. GEMS produces a variety of age-appropriate curriculum for each level. GEMS also partners with Cadets to produce a curriculum for 4- and 5-year-olds, and offers a leadership-development position for high school-aged girls who wish to remain in the program. * Kingdom Kids (4 & 5 year olds) * Awareness Level (grades 1-3) * Discovery Level (grades 4-6) * Advanced Level (grades 7-8) * Counselor-in-Training/CIT (grades 9-12) Magazines GEMS Girls' Clubs produces two magazines that help girls recognize and embrace their potential to be world changers. =SHINE brightly= Published monthly from September through May, SHINE brightly is for girls ages nine to fourteen. Each issue contains three Bible lessons as well as articles and stories that inspire girls to be activists for Christ. The magazine is designed to help girls see how God is at work in their lives and in the world around them. =Sparkle= Produced monthly from October through March, Sparkle is designed for girls in grades 1-3. Through Bible lessons, articles, stories, and games, it seeks to show girls how they can make a difference in the world. Leadership training A crucial aspect of the GEMS ministry is giving women the tools they need to effectively reach out to the girls in their local clubs. Volunteer leaders (counselors) are offered training opportunities in which they learn how to use the GEMS curricula as well as gain important insights into the development stages of the age group they are teaching. These training events are all designed to equip and encourage counselors in their work with girls. Each summer, GEMS hosts its Annual Counselors' Leadership Conference for women. This is a major event for the ministry and is held in different locations around North America. Volunteer leaders are also appointed to various areas of the United States and Canada, and these women offer training and support to the counselors in their geographic region. Accountability GEMS Girls' Clubs is a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Members of the ECFA must adhere to standards of responsible stewardship including high standards of accountability in fundraising, financial disclosure, confidentiality of donor information, and the use of resources. The ministry submits to an annual independent audit.

Gris de Saint-Louis (Grey Saint Louis Hound) is an extinct breed of dog which originated in Medieval times. Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert, it was a scent hound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550‚Äì1574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis (i.e. King Louis IX, 1226‚Äì1270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. They were large, and, even though they did not have such good noses, were preferred by the Kings to the St Huberts, which were said to be only of medium size. Jacques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as 'gris' (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were roughhaired, and were ancestors of the modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds. They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting. George Turberville translated du Fouilloux' book on hunting into English, and used the term 'Dun hound' to translate 'Chien-gris'. It is presumed he did not translate it literally as 'grey-hound' to avoid confusion. One finds the term 'dun-hound' in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these 'dun-hounds' went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the 'badgering' of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds. However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun-hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.

The ancestors of the Mudarthas are believed to have originated from the Assagao and Anjuna villages of the Bardez district in northern Goa. In his historical and genealogical work on the Mudarthas, History of the Mudarthas (1996), Prof. Wilfred D'Souza traces the origin of the Mudarthas to the Goud Saraswat Brahmins who gradually migrated from Kashmir to Goa from the 2nd century BC. He states that while the names of these Brahmin ancestors of the Mudarthas are not known, oral tradition has it that their ancestral surname is Prabhu from the male side and Shenoy from the female side. A legend dictates that one girl from a Shenoy family of Calangute married a boy from a Prabhu family of Assagao, and their family was converted to Roman Catholicism during the middle of the 16th century. The clan of the original Goud Saraswat Brahmin settlers of Assagao were known as Mudras. According to Sanskrit scholar Prof. C. D. J. Pinto, they belonged to the Smartha sect. The Mudras belonged to the Bharadwaj gotra (clan), and their kuladevata (family deity) was Bhumika-Ravalnath. When the Portuguese began their conversion activities, most Mudras fled with the idols of their families to the North and settled in different parts of southern Maharashtra. Those who remained in Bardez became Catholics and came to be called Mudots. Some Mudots migrated to South Canara to escape a famine in 1591 and settled down first in the Balegundi area of Belman, where they eventually came to known as Mudarthas. Gradually, some of these Mudarthas moved towards Shirva and Moodubelle. During the 19th and 20th centuries, most of the Mudarthas changed their surname to D'Souza, while a few from Belman still continue to bear the surname. According to Mangalorean genealogist Michael Lobo, the known D'Souza-Mudartha clans include the D'Souza family of Belman; D'Souza family of Bendore; D'Souza family of Kirem; D'Souza family of Moodubelle; D'Souza family of Mulki; D'Souza family of Pakshikere; D'Souza family of Pezar; D'Souza family of Pilar; and the D'Souza family of Shirva. Footnotes : a While the family tradition of the Mudarthas has it that the original surname of the Mudras was Prabhu, this is denied by the Mudras themselves who assert that their surname has always been as it is. : b Their descendants in North Goa and southern Maharashtra still carry the Mudra surname. Two notable descendants are freedom fighters Rajaram Vaman Mudra and Shashikanta Dattaram Mudra. : c The Mudras who embraced Christianity were called Mudarth by the Hindus and Mudorth by the Christians. However, the Catholic clergy recorded their surnames in the church records as Mudot. Their descendants at present bear Lusitanian surnames such as de Souza. Citations References *. *. *.

The society was founded in 1630 by Giovanni Francesco Loredano and Guido Casoni, and derived its basic Aristotelian philosophy from Cesare Cremonini, a Peripatetic who was professor of philosophy at the University of Padua.Rosand, pp. 37‚Äì40 The society included historians, poets, and librettists. According to historian Ellen Rosand, the academy, in keeping with its name, usually operated behind the scenes. Members often wrote in a secret language and frequently published their works anonymously. The Accademia degli Incogniti was particularly active in the promotion of musical theater in Venice from the 1630s onward, founding its own theater, the Teatro Novissimo, which flourished briefly between 1641 and 1645. In their librettos for musical dramas, the iconoclastic intellectuals of the academy set a tone which was \\"[often] shockingly frank and frequently amoral\\". Among these librettists were Giacomo Badoaro, who wrote Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria for Claudio Monteverdi, and Giovanni Francesco Busenello, who provided Monteverdi with the libretto for the composer's final and arguably greatest operatic work, L'incoronazione di Poppea.Ringer, pp. 213‚Äì214 Although the academy is often depicted as a group of \\"sceptical libertines extolling a peculiarly Venetian brand of (im)morality\\",Carter, p. 271.

It came to national attention as one of many groups opposed to the Hatchfield stud farm development. Newmarket Newmarket is generally regarded as the global centre of thoroughbred horse racing. It is one of two major business clusters in its region, the other being the Cambridge Science Park.http://www.westsuffolk.gov.uk/Council/Policies_Strategies_and_Plans/upload/NewmarketHorseracingIndustryReportSep2015.pdf The horse racing and breeding businesses provide over 8,500 jobs in the town alone. However, it has been noted that whilst being the leading employer, the racing industry in the town is fragile for a number of reasons, one being the difficulty of providing for the safe movement each day of the thousands of horses that are kept in Newmarket through the town to its training grounds. Save Historic Newmarket began with small projects, including advising retailer Majestic Wine on a redesign of their new shop in the town, then in the planning stage. It is now one of the company's showcase shops. The group supports development in the district area surrounding Newmarket, Suffolk, and has supported a number of towns in the district who wish to greatly increase their housing allocations. However, it also supports the view of major local businesses that the proposed use of Hatchfield farm for 1,200 houses would be disastrous for the town's small and major businesses and employees, partially owing to a congested and inflexible road system in the town and poor present means of movement for horses around the town. Over 3,000 horses live in Newmarket, and most need to use the training grounds on a daily basis. Opposition to Hatchfield stud farm development Save Historic Newmarket first came to national attention in 2009The Telegraph: Racing industry fury at Lord Derby's plans for 1,200 new homes in Newmarket by organising opposition to plans by Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby to build on the land adjacent to his Staney House stud farm.google The group and its affiliates have argued that the development represents a very poor cost-benefit bargain, as it threatens the town's future as a major economic, exporting and employment centre, whilst providing a residential development suited to nearby towns which have repeatedly requested more houses than they have been allocated in local plans. The development has also been opposed by major local employers including the Jockey Club, Tattersalls, Godolphin racing, Darley Stud, and trainers Sir Michael Stoute, Henry Cecil, James Fanshawe, Luca Cumani, John Gosden, Clive Brittain, John Berry and many others. Senior managers of Godolphin Racing admitted that they could be forced to leave Newmarket if the development was approved. It is estimated that Godolphin and sister company Darley's departure from Newmarket would lead to the loss of at least 1,000 jobs. On 2 June 2010, Forest Heath Planning Councillors unanimously rejected Lord Derby's plans on five separate grounds.The Racing Post: Lord Derby's Hatchfield Farm plans rejected This was the first such local decision following announcement of the abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies by Conservative Communities and Local Government Minister Eric Pickles. Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby appealed the unanimous rejection of his plans. Local residents have said they had to raise up to ¬£1 million to fight Lord Derby's appeal. A group of local residents and businesses including Save Historic Newmarket then challenged the district council's planning strategy in the High Court, arguing it was flawed. On 25 March 2011, a Mr Justice Collins quashed the entire planning strategy related to Newmarket.The Belfast Telegraph: Racing fans win Newmarket battle The council and Lord Derby, who had joined them in opposing the local residents, were ordered to pay 90% of the groups' costs and refused leave to appeal.Save Historic Newmarket Ltd & Ors v Forest Heath District Council & Ors [2011] EWHC 606 (Admin) Lord Derby's appeal proceeded throughout much of summer 2011, and was the subject of protests from local residents and businesses.

The plans were rejected by Newmarket Town Council, and all Newmarket's councillors on Forest Heath District Council. However, councillors for other towns voted for them, and they were approved by a majority decision. The Secretary of State immediately called the plans in, and a decision is expected in December 2015. Opposition to the George Lambton Playing Fields development The group has also opposed an application to replace the town's communal playing fields with a Sainsbury's supermarket.

From 1888 to the end of the 20th century the house was occupied by the Viscounts Leverhulme. History The land on which the house stands was owned originally by the Mostyn family of North Wales. The land was bought in 1849 by Charles William Potts, a solicitor. It is thought that he built the manor house, but there is no evidence that he lived there. In 1863 Potts sold the house and land to Thomas Brittain Forwood, a businessman who died in 1884. His son, Sir William Forwood, chairman of Liverpool Overhead Railway, let the house to William Lever (later 1st Viscount Leverhulme), builder of the soap factory and model village at Port Sunlight, in 1888. =Leverhulme era= Thornton Manor became the home of the Viscounts Leverhulme. William Lever bought the house in 1893 and lived here from 1888 until 1919, retaining ownership until his death in 1925. Lever started on a series of alterations and additions soon after his purchase. The architect Jonathan Simpson made some minor alterations but the first major work was designed by the Chester firm Douglas and Fordham in about 1896. This constituted the main block of the house and was in Elizabethan style. In 1899 stables designed by J. J. Talbot were built and around this time a kitchen and service quarters designed by Grayson and Ould were added. In 1902 a music room followed, also designed by Talbot, and this formed a new block to the northeast of the main block. Two years later a temporary ballroom was built, which was later converted into a swimming pool. A porch was added to the south front in 1906, changing the main entrance to the house from the west to the south. A gatehouse designed by J. Lomax-Simpson was built in 1910; the base of this is in stone and its upper part is half-timbered. In 1913 a major reconstruction of the house took place when Elizabethan-style wings were added to the west side of the house. Lomax-Simpson was again the architect. In the process of the reconstruction, most of the work designed by Douglas and Fordham was demolished, leaving from their design only two shaped gables and semicircular bay windows. Plans for further enlargement of the house were prepared by Lomax-Simpson, but these were not built because of the outbreak of the First World War. The 1st Viscount Leverhulme died in May 1925 and the house was inherited by his son, William, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme. He died in May 1949 and the house passed to his son, Philip, 3rd Viscount Leverhulme. Lord Leverhulme died in July 2000, and, the following year, the house was sold with planning permission to convert it into a hotel. The house contents sale broke the UK record by raising ¬£10 million in 2001. Architecture The house is built in stone with slate roofs. It has three storeys and an irregular plan. The entrance front faces southwest and has protruding wings on both sides. Behind the house, at an angle towards the northeast, is the wing containing the music room. The windows are mullioned and a number of them are in canted, two-storey bays. The stables extend to the northwest. Grounds The park was first laid out during Forwood's ownership. It included paths, a small summer house and a bridge. The gardens as they are now, were planned by Thomas H. Mawson and the 1st Viscount. The kitchen garden contains a loggia dated 1912, and there is another loggia to the southeast of the house; both were designed by Lomax-Simpson. To the northeast of the house is a structure known as The Lookout, which was designed in 1896 by Douglas and Fordham. A lake lies to the west of the house. A system of tree-lined avenues was laid out in 1912‚Äì14 by Lomax-Simpson, and has a total length of about . Present day The Manor House is now privately owned and is available to hire for weddings and events. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar held private talks at Thornton Manor on 10 October 2019 in relation to Brexit.

The building was extensively renovated between 2001-2003, at which point its name changed to the Milwaukee Theatre.http://www.milwaukeetheatre.com/about-us/about-milwaukee-theatre/ A naming rights deal changed its name in 2017 to the Miller High Life Theatre.

Milwaukee Auditorium The Milwaukee Auditorium was built in 1909, in a place formerly occupied by the Milwaukee Industrial Exposition Building, which had been destroyed by fire in 1905. The Milwaukee Auditorium held 13,520 people, and had of exhibition space.William George Bruce, History and City and County. Milwaukee: S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1922. pp. 421-432. http://www.hellomilwaukee.com/BookFiles/Chap27_The_milwaukee_auditorium1.pdf The cornerstone was laid on August 1, 1908, and the building was dedicated on September 21, 1909.http://www.mkedcd.org/Planning/hpc/studyreports/MilwaukeeAuditorium2000.pdf At that time philanthropist Elizabeth Plankinton donated a $10,000 pipe organ. Historical uses included concerts, circuses, political rallies and sports events. For decades the Milwaukee Auditorium boasted its own orchestra, and hosted touring concerts from such historic notables as John Phillip Sousa and Enrico Caruso to contemporary stars like Barry Manilow, Nirvana, Marilyn Manson, ABBA, the Carpenters, and Prince. Sitting Presidents from Taft to Clinton delivered important policy addresses in the Auditorium.http://wcd.org/categories/12-wcdinformation/documents/1-about- us#History On October 14, 1912, former president and then current presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Milwaukee Auditorium shortly after a failed assassination attempt on him across the street from the Auditorium at the Gilpatrick Hotel, by a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank. Schrank shot Roosevelt, but the bullet lodged in Roosevelt's chest only after hitting both his steel eyeglass case and a 50-page text of his campaign speech titled \\"Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual\\", folded over twice in Roosevelt's breast pocket. Schrank was immediately disarmed, captured and might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed. Roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right, then ordered police to take charge of Schrank and to make sure no violence was done to him. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined to go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt.John Gurda. Cream City Chronicles: Stories of Milwaukee's Past. Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society Press, 2016, pp. 189-191. He spoke for 90 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.\\". Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.Timeline of Theodore Roosevelt's Life by the Theodore Roosevelt Association at www.theodoreroosevelt.org Structural and cosmetic improvements were made throughout the Auditorium's life, both before and after a major 1978 renovation brought in modern heating and air conditioning, restored architectural details and overall physical upgrades. However, by the time it was acquired by the new Wisconsin Center District in 1995, the Auditorium's continued viability was questioned ‚Äì until a 20-day run of Riverdance, in 1999, shattered sales records and indicated that a market existed for a venue of its size. From May 23, 1974 until November 22, 1995, the venue was named the MECCA Auditorium.https://wcd.org/about-the-wcd/history-of-events/ MECCA was an acronym for \\"Milwaukee Exposition, Convention Center and Arena\\". The MECCA complex included the auditorium, a sports arena, and a convention center. The name reverted to Milwaukee Auditorium in 1995. Milwaukee Theatre Beginning in October 2001, the Auditorium was converted into a theater. The project, which cost $41.9 million, was completed on November 7, 2003. In January 2016, MillerCoors purchased naming rights from the Wisconsin Center District for $1.85 million. In April 2017, the name officially changed from the Milwaukee Theatre to the Miller High Life Theatre.http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2017/04/25/miller-high-life- theatre-signs-installed-at-former.html Since opening, The Miller High Life Theatre has hosted a wide range of convention, corporate, religious and political assemblies as well as Broadway musicals and other entertainment.

The co-pilot was eventually freed from the wreckage three hours after the crash.Co-pilot stuck in wreckage for 3 hours Of the 10 passengers and 5 crew, all survived the initial crash with injuries to 10 people on the aircraft and in the VIP terminal. One female passenger died shortly after arriving at a hospital. A RwandAir spokesperson said, \\"He landed safely on the runway and was guided by the marshals into the parking area. For some unexplained reason, the plane, from the parking spot, took off again at full power and ... took a right turn, unexplained, into the technical building.\\"RwandAir spokesperson The METAR in force at the time of the accident was HRYR 121030Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN030 24/18 Q1018 NOSIG=.Translation of METAR: METAR for Kigali Airport, issued on the 12th of the month at 10:30 UTC.

Aftermath Post-flight investigation revealed the cable connecting the Left Thrust Lever to the engine assembly had severed shortly after application of Takeoff power. A procedure in the aircraft's Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) titled \\"Thrust Lever Jammed\\" would have directed the pilots to shut down the left engine by utilizing the Left Engine Fire push switch, which would have closed (among other things) the Fuel SOV (shutoff valve), thus allowing the speed of the aircraft to be better controlled while landing the aircraft. This QRH procedure would have been accomplished \\"at a safe altitude\\" per the procedure, while giving consideration to terrain or other obstacles. The pilots did not perform the above procedure, and instead, chose to immediately return to the airport, landing at a higher than normal airspeed due to the left engine still producing takeoff thrust, making it difficult to stop the aircraft and using much greater runway distance than normal. The aircraft was taxied back to the terminal with the left engine still producing takeoff power and the right engine at idle. When the aircraft was brought to a stop at the terminal building, the right engine was shut down by the pilots, the left engine was still operating at takeoff thrust, and the hydraulics were all turned \\"off\\", which was common procedure at the time. The aircraft disc brakes on the Canadair CRJ-100 are operated by two of the three hydraulic systems on the aircraft, with System 2 supplied by pumps on the right engine (both mechanical and electric) and System 3 being supplied by two electric pumps. By shutting off the right engine and all of the electric hydraulic systems, the brakes as well as the parking brake were no longer being powered. As the hydraulic pressure bled down and with the left engine still producing takeoff thrust, the aircraft jumped over the chocks, lurched to the right (caused by the left engine thrust), and hit the terminal building.RwandAir Jet Crashes into VIP Terminal in Kigali and Kills One Passenger The left engine was eventually shut down by the airport crash tender spraying foam into the engine.

The organization has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, where it won a \\"Use Your Life Award\\" from the Oprah's Angel Network, in Dwell, and in the Chicago Sun Times among other national publications. Red Feather incorporates environmentally and culturally sustainable materials and practices into its education efforts. Work on the reservations is done in partnership with American Indian communities to address the severe housing crisis within their nations through educating on home weatherization, home maintenance techniques and facilitating volunteerism.  History  Red Feather Development Group was founded in 1994 in Bellevue, Washington, by Robert and Anita Young. The mission of the organization came to fruition because of an Indian Country Today article about the extreme cold weather and how tribal members were freezing to death in their homes. The organization was named after Katherine Red Feather, the first Native American to receive the organization's services. For the first six years the organization was operated by the Youngs and they built conventional housing, home rehabilitation and updates with the help of volunteers. In 1999, with the help of the University of Washington College of Built Environments, the Youngs were able to launch the American Indian Sustainable Housing Initiative. The Initiative focused solely on straw-bale building techniques and emphasized housing self-sufficiency with partner tribal communities. 18 homes were built over 10 years in 28-day cycles with the help of volunteers from around the country. Currently, Red Feather partners with the Northern Cheyenne, Navajo and Hopi Reservations. In 2003, the organization moved to Bozeman, Montana, to be closer to the native communities with whom it partners and serves. In 2010, Red Feather opened the Flagstaff, Arizona, office.  Programs  EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH: Red Feather provides hands-on training of all members of the Native American community (women, children, veterans, families and elders) for safe and healthy home technology and repair. The workshops are \\"Do It Yourself\\" on home weatherization and home maintenance. Red Feather is currently developing two new workshops on the health linkages to the burning of wood and coal stoves in reservation homes and the impact of mold and mildew in reservation homes. Red Feather is a partner with APS (Arizona Public Service) to present weatherization workshops and interventions to improve energy-efficient homes. Red Feather partners with tribal resources such as the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Housing Authority to build self- sustaining communities for safe and healthy housing through tenant seminars. NATIVE HOMES REPAIR NETWORK: Red Feather partners with Native American homeowners to identify housing repair needs and access to resources to solve their home issues. Using a case management process, Red Feather is currently piloting assistance through home repair and health assessment professionals to assess reservation homes for health risks and necessary repairs. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIAL PROJECTS: Red Feather engages in projects on the 3 reservations that require special intervention. In 2015, a $70,000 home renovation project was initiated for Navajo Code Talker Dan Akee, a WWII veteran and one of 12 living Navajo Code Talkers. Red Feather engages volunteers from all walks of life to contribute to housing projects on Native American reservations.

Even with modern obstetrics and pain control, childbirth is still an ordeal for many women. During delivery, or immediately afterwards, dramatic complications are occasionally seen - delirium, stupor, rage, acts of desperation or neonaticide. These complications will be briefly reviewed in turn Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. . With the great improvement in obstetric care, most of them have become rare. There is, however, a great contrast between Europe, North America, Australia, Japan and some other countries with advanced medical care, and the rest of the world. The wealthiest nations produce only 10 million children each year, from a total of 135 million. They have a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 6‚Äì20/100,000. Some poorer nations with high birth rates have an MMR more than 100 times as high,Hill K, AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Estimates of maternal mortality for 1995. Bulletin of the World Health Organization 79: 182-192. and, presumably, a corresponding prevalence of severe morbidity. In Africa, India & South East Asia, and Latin America, these complications of parturition may still be as important as they have been throughout human history. Three settings for childbirth =Modern childbirth= In nations with state-of-the-art obstetric services, childbirth is always supervised by a midwife or obstetrician. Pain can be relieved by nitrous oxide, pethidine or an epidural anaesthetic, and complications can be dealt with promptly, if necessary by emergency Caesarean section. These services are now standard procedure in many countries. Even so, parturition can still be a severe ordeal, and at least one third find it a traumatic experience Soet J E, Brack G A, Dilorio C (2003) Prevalence and predictors of women‚Äôs experience of psychological trauma during childbirth. Birth 30: 36-46.. Although women spend only a few days, sometimes only a few hours, in labour, it is often an extreme experience, as shown by the frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder. The complications listed below, though rare, can still occur. =Historic childbirth= This is a term used here to describe the birth of children before the introduction (in 1847) of effective pain relief Simpson J Y (1847) A new anaesthetic agent, more efficient than sulphuric ether. Lancet 50: 549-560.. During that time psychiatric complications were clearly described, well recognized and common in countries with the best health services. Those conditions still exist in nations with high birth rates and a dearth of trained staff. At the beginning of this century only about one third of births in tropical Africa and South-East Asia were attended by doctors or midwives AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Maternal mortality at the end of the decade. Bulletin of the World Health Organization 79: 561-573.. Although there has been some improvement since then Prata N, Passano P, Rowen T, Bell S, Walsh J, Potts M (2011) Where there are (few) skilled birth attendants.

Crowe S, Utley M, Costello A, Pagel C (2012) How many births in sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia will not be attended by a skilled birth attendant between 2011 and 2015? BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 12: 4., it is still true that about half the births in many nations are not supervised by skilled attendants. =Clandestine labour= The third setting is concealed labour, endured by a woman who has dissembled her pregnancy. Not only is there no analgesia or skilled attendance, but there is no emotional support; on the contrary, the mother‚Äôs mental state is disturbed by anger, fear, shame or despair. Most neonaticides occur in this setting. Perpetrators have rarely given a personal account, but experienced obstetricians have attempted a graphic description of their state of mind Gall F J (1822).

There is objective evidence that complications are much more common Freyer M (1887) Die Ohnmacht bei der Geburt vom gerichts√§rzlichen Standpunkt. Berlin, Springer.. Tocophobia The word comes from the Greek tokos, meaning parturition. Early authors like IdelerIdeler K W (1856) √úber den Wahnsinn der Schwangeren. Charit√©-Annalen 7: 28-47. wrote about this fear, and, in 1937, BinderBinder H (1937) Psychiatrische Untersuchungen √ºber die Folgen der operativen Sterilisierung der Frau durch partielle Tubenresektion. Schweizer Archiv f√ºr Neurologie und Psychiatrie 40: 1-49. drew attention to a group of women who sought sterilization because of tocophobia. In the last 40 years there have been a series of papers published mainly from Scandinavia. Tocophobia can be primary (before the first child is born) or secondary (typically after extremely traumatic deliveries). Elective Caesarean section is one solution, but psychotherapy can also help these women to give birth vaginally.Nerum H, Halvorsen L, S√∏rile T, √òian P (2006) Maternal request for Cesarean section due to fear of birth: can it be changed through crisis- orientated counseling?

International Journal of Clinical Practice 60: 1675-1678.. These extreme cases illustrate the strong wish that some women have to bring pregnancy to an end; occasionally they importunately demand premature delivery, whatever the risk to the infant. Delirium during labour Under the name ‚Äòparturient delirium‚Äô, this is defined name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p94-100.\\" as an acute (usually sudden) clouding of consciousness, lasting minutes or hours, with full recovery. Onset is usually towards the end of labour, and recovery after the birth. Any of the following may be observed ‚Äì incoherent speech, misidentification of persons, visual hallucinations, inappropriate behaviour such as singing, or memory loss for the episode. A phasic course, with alternate delirium and clarity, continuation into the puerperium, and recurrence after another pregnancy have been described in a few cases. It was one of the first psychiatric disorders, related to childbearing, to be described Kirkland T (1774) Treatise on childbed fevers and on the methods of preventing them. London, Baldwin and Dawson, pages 60-62. , and its importance in the early 19th century is indicated by an early classification, stating that it was one of two recognized forms of puerperal insanity Reid J (1848) On the causes, symptoms and treatment of puerperal insanity. Journal of Psychological Medicine 1: 128-151. . More than 50 cases have been described, most of them in the epoch when parturition was endured without effective pain relief. The disorder has almost disappeared in nations with advanced obstetrics, with only two early 20th century reports Pollack (1929) Psychosisok a terhess√©g, sz√ºl√©s √©s gyermek√°gy alatt. Orvosi Hetilap 44: 1110-1104. Ciulla U (1940) Disturbi psichici e psicosi nello stato puerperale. Monitore Ostetrico-Ginecologico 12: 577-626. . But, within the last ten years, there were 28 nations in which fewer than half the births were attended by skilled birth attendants; they included Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, each with more than 3 million births/year Prata N, Passano P, Rowne T, Bell S, Walsh J, Potts M (2011) Where there are (few) skilled birth attendants. Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition 29: 81-91. . In 2012, it was estimated that 130-180 million infants would be delivered in the quinquennium 2011-2015 without skilled birth attendance Crowe S, Utley M, Costello A, Pagel C (2012) How many births in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will not be attended by a skilled birth attendant between 2011 and 2015? BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 12: 4. . There are still many countries where parturition in the 21st century is like that in Europe in the early 19th century, and women are at risk of becoming delirious during labour. Unconscious delivery Childbirth can occur during natural sleep name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p94.\\" , and under excessively heavy sedation, including alcohol intoxication Clay C (1841) On the prevalence of almost unconscious parturition in manufacturing districts. Lancet, pages 404-407. . A diverse list of medical disorders have led to delivery during coma, including head injury, antepartum bleeding, severe hypotension and hypothermia name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p104.\\" . Of these the commonest is eclampsia name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p101 & 103.\\" . There are ten cases in the literature of unexplained stupor or coma, including cases with features of catatonia Van Rooy (1908) Een geval van bewusteloosheid tijdens de baring. Verslag van het behandelde in de Vergarderomgem vam Januari to Mei 1908, der Nederlandsche Gynaecologische Vereeniging te Amsterdam door Dr. Catharine van Tussenbroek. Nederlander Tijdschrift voor Verloskunde en Gynaecologie 18: 284-287. . Acts of desperation In women facing death during obstructed labour, panic or despair can drive them to take desperate remedies. There are about twenty cases of suicide attempts or completed suicide name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p114.\\" . The suicidal motive is not depression or shame, but unbearable pain and despair. The methods ‚Äì throwing themselves out of the window, hanging or drowning ‚Äì show the extremity of the mother‚Äôs suffering. There are more than 20 descriptions of auto-Caesarean section Szabo A, Brockington I F (2014) Auto-Caesarean section: a review of 22 cases. Archives of Women‚Äôs Mental Health 17: 79-81.. In a few cases the apparent motive has been the destruction of an unwanted child, or psychiatric illness, but the majority have been desperate remedies when the infant cannot be delivered and the nearest obstetric unit was beyond reach. Most of these cases have been reported from poor countries, where contributions to literature are scarce, and they may be more common there. The mother usually survives, but few infants survive. Psychosis during labour Various psychoses can start during labour name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p115-6.\\" . Of the organic psychoses, eclamptic, Donkin, epileptic and infective psychoses have all started during labour, although postpartum onset is usual. These differ from parturient delirium in their duration, lasting at least a few days, not a few hours. In addition, there are 19 cases of bipolar episodes with onset during labour; they differ from parturient delirium in their symptomatology (mania rather than delirium) and a duration measured in weeks. These cases are evidence that, on the balance of probability, the trigger of bipolar/cycloid episodes is already active during parturition. Parturient rage During the final painful contractions which lead to the expulsion of the infant, some women have become extremely angry. Before the introduction of effective pain relief (1847), obstetricians were familiar with this, and referred to it under names like parturient rage, furor uterinus, Wut der Geb√§renden and col√®re d‚Äôaccouch√©es. Some mothers lost control and attacked their husband, obstetricians, midwives or other attendants. At one time it was common, and clearly described Kluge M (1833) Mania parturientium transitoria. Medizinische Zeitung 2: 97-98. Scanzoni F W (1855) Franz A Kiwisch Ritter von Rotterau‚Äôs Klinische Vortr√§ge √ºber specielle Pathologie und Therapie der Krankheiten des weiblischen Geschlechtes. Prage, Calve, page 520.. It still occurs occasionally under modern obstetric conditions. The infant is at risk, because angry mothers have reached down to haul the baby out, or made a dangerous assault on the new-born; for example, a 40-year old mother, at the end of her 1st pregnancy, kicked away the midwife, tore out the infant, and killed it by striking its head against the bedpost Albert, of Euerdorf (1850) Wut der Gebarenden und W√∂chnerinnen. Medizinisches Correspondenzblatt Bayerischer √Ñrzte 11: 737-738.. If this can occur during supervised labours, how much more often will it occur in clandestine births, where the mother has no pain relief or support, and is already bitterly angry about the behaviour of the child‚Äôs father. In most neonaticides, the infant is killed by suffocation, drowning or exposure. But in a minority there is extraordinary brutality ‚Äì the head smashed with multiple fractures or splintering of bone, the head cut or torn off, the infant stabbed many times, or a combination of these. The pathology bears witness to the mother‚Äôs mental state. Nowadays, this phenomenon would not regarded as a mental illness, and the only diagnosis could be ‚Äòunspecified disorder of adult personality and behaviour‚Äô World Health Organization. The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines. Geneva, WHO, F69, page 224.. But this has not always been so. In France, Esquirol mentioned a mother who stabbed her infant 26 times with a pair of scizzors; she was acquitted because the judges considered that she was suffering from mental derangement Gall F J (1822). Sur l'Origine des Qualit√©s Morales et des Facult√©s Intellectuelles de l'Homme, et sur les Conditions de leur Manifestation. Paris, Boucher, volume 1, pages 391-391.. There is an insoluble judicial problem, because violence is sometimes a feature of delirium; in a clandestine birth, it is impossible to know whether consciousness was clouded or not. Pathological mental states immediately after the birth Immediately after the birth, an exhausted mother, fainting or in shock, may not be able to care for the new-born, who often needs resuscitation, and can suffocate in mucus or blood. Exhaustion alone, without syncope or delirium, can prevent a mother from helping a dying infant; in clandestine labours, it can be fatal to the new-born, without mens rea. Brief states of delirium have been described with onset after the birth, less common but similar to those that occur during parturition. There are about 20 in the literature name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p118-9.\\" . Several of them have been accompanied by violence, and, after recovery a few hours later, followed by amnesia. Occasionally mothers have had recurrent episodes. Postpartum stupor has been described Kelso J (1840) Nervous exhaustion dependent on and complicating the puerperal state with cases. Lancet i: 945-948. Tott C A (1844) F√§lle von melancholia attonita bei Neuenbunderen. Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Geburtskunde 16: 187-190., beginning immediately or very shortly after the birth. The mother remains speechless, immobile and unresponsive to any stimuli for hours or even a day or more name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p119-122.\\" . These stupors differ in duration and clinical features from postpartum bipolar disorder. They have been phasic, with recovery and relapse. Their cause is unknown. Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Postpartum PTSD was first described in 1978.Bydlowski M, Raoul-Duval A (1978) Un avatar psychique m√©connu de la puerperalit√©: la n√©vrose traumatique post obst√©tricale. Perspectives Psychiatriques 4: 321-328. Since then more than 100 papers have been published. After excessively painful labours, or those with a disturbing loss of control, fear of death or infant loss, or complications requiring forceps delivery or emergency Caesarean section, some mothers suffer symptoms similar to those occurring after other harrowing experiences; these include intrusive memories (flashbacks), nightmares, and a high-tension state, with avoidance of triggers such as hospitals or words associated with parturition James S (2015) Women‚Äôs experiences of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic childbirth: a review and critical appraisal. Archives of Women‚Äôs Mental Health 18: 761-771.. The frequency depends on criteria and severity, but figures of 2-4% are representative Alcorn K L, O‚ÄôDonavan A, Patrick J C, Creedy D, Devilly G J (2010) A prospective longitudinal study of the prevalence of PTSD resulting from childbirth events. Psychological Medicine 40: 1849-1859.; these symptoms can last for many months Sentilhes L, Maillard F, Brun S, Madar H, Merlot B, Goffinet F, Deneux-Tharaux C (2017) Risk factors for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder development one year after vaginal delivery: a prospective, observational study. Scientific Reports ‚Äì Nature 7: 8724; doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-09314x.. Some avoid further pregnancy (secondary tocophobia), and those who become pregnant again may experience a return of symptoms, especially in the last trimester. These mothers can be helped by counseling soon after the birth Asadzadeh L, Jafari E, Khraghani R, Taremian F (2020) Effectiveness of midwife-led brief counseling intervention on post- traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms of women experiencing a traumatic childbirth: a randomized controlled trial.

Frontiers in Psychiatry 9: 591; doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00591.. Complaining reactions Another reaction to a severe experience of childbirth is pathological complaining (paranoia querulans in the International Classification of Diseases) The ICD-10 Classication of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines. Geneva, World Health Organization, pages 97 & 98.. These mothers complain bitterly about perceived mismanagement. The complaints, directed at midwives or other staff members, vary from lack of pain relief, unnecessary epidural anaesthesia, poor condition of the baby, humiliation or ‚Äòdehumanization‚Äô, excessive use of technology, student examinations, or lack of explanation and sympathy Brockington I F (1996) Motherhood and Mental Health. Oxford, Oxford University Press, pages 154-156.. Occasionally the content is truly absurd ‚Äì one mother‚Äôs intense resentment was her husband suggesting the wrong name for the infant. In response to these ‚Äòoutrages‚Äô, mothers may harangue the midwives repeatedly or write critical letters, and are preoccupied with fantasies of revenge ‚Äì ‚Äòbeating the midwives to pulp‚Äô, ‚Äòsmashing the doctor‚Äôs head in‚Äô, ‚Äòburning the hospital down‚Äô. Angry rumination may continue for weeks, months or more than a year. The frequency is similar to post-traumatic stress disorder Brockington I F, Macdonald E, Wainscott G (2006) Anxiety, obsessions and morbid preoccupations in pregnancy and the puerperium. Archives of Women‚Äôs Mental Health 9: 253-263., and there is an association between the two complications. The effect on child care is like that of severe depression, but the emotional state (furious anger, not sadness and despair) and treatment strategy are different. Psychotherapy is directed at distracting the mother from her grievances, and reinforcing productive child-centered activity; a diary is a useful focus ‚Äì the therapist listens with sympathy to her complaints, then turns to the written record, expressing pleasure and interest in the mother‚Äôs achievements in spite of them.

Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Camacho attended Bridgewater State College, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees in education. Camacho's professional playing career extended from 1948 through 1957, with two seasons (1951‚Äì52) missed due to military service during the Korean War.

In 790 minor league games, he batted .285 with 52 home runs. Camacho spent 1958 through 1968 out of professional baseball, working as a teacher and high school baseball coach and as a senior instructor with the Ted Williams Baseball Camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts. When Williams was named manager of the Washington Senators during the 1968‚Äì69 offseason, he called former Boston Red Sox teammate Johnny Pesky and invited Pesky to be his bench coach.

Marking the first produced script for series writer Sean Crouch, the episode features Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and mathematicians investigating a series of arsons that may have been started by an ecoterrorist group. Bill Nye \\"The Science Guy\\", who is a fan of the show, guest stars as a colleague of scientists Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol). \\"Scorched\\" first aired in the United States on December 16, 2005. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. Plot summary Arsonists set two fires to a car dealership, one which destroys an SUV and one which kills a salesman. FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno), as well as Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) (Don's brother and a FBI math consultant), arrive at the scene and learn that an ecoterrorist group is implicated in the arsons. Surprising Don and Charlie, Paul Stevens (Loren Dean), an arson investigator with the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), asks if Charlie could help the LAFD with their investigation. When Colby and FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) question the ecoterrorist group's members, the group denies involvement in the arsons and accuses the FBI of making false accusations. The team runs faces in a photo that Colby confiscated at the ecoterrorist group's office through photo recognition software. They discover that a student named Jake Eckworth (A.J. Trauth) appeared at three other arson scenes. Using information given to them by Jake's roommate Ethan Powell (Blake Bashoff), Megan, Colby, and Don track Jake to a construction site. When confronted by the FBI agents, Jake denies setting the fires. Meanwhile, Charlie and Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's friend and colleague, discuss creating a \\"fireprint\\", a profile of the fires and the possible motives for them. Using records from the LAFD, Charlie and Larry learn that 17 fires over the past two years match the fireprint for the current fires. They then consult Professor Bill Waldie (Bill Nye) and reconstruct the lethal fire using a scaled model of the car dealership booth and a cigarette. When no reaction occurs, Charlie, Larry, and Bill realize that the fire was intentionally set. Back at Charlie's house, Charlie and Don's father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), suggests to Charlie and Larry that the fires at the car dealership are two separate fires instead of one fire as Charlie and Larry were considering. While discussing the case at the FBI office, Don, Megan, Colby, and Charlie learn of a fire at an office building. This time, six firefighters suffer smoke inhalation as there was not enough water in the fire hose to put out the fire. When Ethan is brought in for questioning, he confesses to the fire. At the house, Alan demonstrates Pascal's law to Charlie and Larry, who are confused how a lack of water pressure could occur when the fire equipment registered normal pressure. Charlie determines that someone tampered with the office building's standpipe to create a lack of water pressure. Armed with the new evidence, Megan and Jake convince Ethan, whom Megan believes is innocent of committing the actual arsons, to tell the FBI who had asked for Ethan's help. Using Ethan's chat room account, which was obtained earlier in the investigation, the team traces Ethan's chat to a LAFD station. Charlie's analysis of the fires confirms the location and reveals that Stevens was behind all of the related arsons, including the fatal one at the car dealership. The team learns that Stevens was taking revenge on the LAFD as the LAFD rejected his application to be a firefighter years earlier. Don and the team confront Stevens at the same construction site where they confronted Jake. During the confrontation, Stevens attempts to escape, but accidentally bangs his head and an explosion occurs due to him carrying combustible white phosphorus, killing Stevens. At Charlie's house, Don breaks the news to Charlie and Alan that Ethan has accepted a plea deal in which Ethan would serve three year's prison time. Charlie, who had earlier in the investigation talked with Ethan about the difficulties of being child prodigies, confides in his father and brother that he possibly could have done the same things that Ethan has done. Production =Writing= \\"Scorched\\" was series writer Sean Crouch's first produced television script. Originally from Colorado, Crouch knew of the Earth Liberation Front's (ELF's) involvement of the fires at Vail and based the ELM, the ecoterrorist group in the episode, on the real-life ELF. In developing the script, Crouch asked for assistance from people he knew. He asked a couple of Colorado arson investigators for assistance with the script. He also asked his family, as they were engineers, for ideas about engineering projects, especially nanotubes. His wife suggested using Jake's hat as a clue, and Crouch's childhood experiments inspired the final scene where Alan attempted to clean up Charlie and Larry's earlier experiment in the bathroom. As a result of his college science classes, Crouch included several experiments in the script. In the commentary for \\"Scorched\\", Crouch admitted that the most difficult part of writing the script was keeping the plot twist hidden from the audience. As for the math, Crouch included two known equations. He mentioned Michael Faraday's The Natural History of the Candle since the episode was about fire. He also utilized Dr. Vytenis Babrauskas' equations for some of the equations on the markerboards in the episode. He also decided to include Leopold and Loeb as a part of Megan's profiling training. The events of this episode bear some resemblance to the case of William Cottrell, a former Ph.D. candidate at Caltech who was convicted in April 2005 of conspiracy to arson of 8 sport utility vehicles and a Hummer dealership in the name of the Earth Liberation Front. Numb3rs has filmed many episodes at Caltech (including this episode), and Caltech faculty have worked on the show as technical advisors.Crime and Computation =Filming= Norberto Barba directed the episode. Since the episode was about arson, he included several shots of fires being ignited. Incidentally, all of the flames ignited during takes instead of being edited in later, an event that rarely happens in television production. Barba also included three instances where the FBI team had to walk through either their bullpen (the desks at the FBI office) or the construction site. In the case of the walks through the construction site, the filming was for dramatic effect. Barba and the crew filmed at several locations around the Los Angeles area. They filmed in the dormitories and near the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and at the building behind the LA Center Studios building, the building where Numb3rs was usually filmed. Barba and the crew also spent a day filming at a construction site in the Simi Valley. The site was selected as a visual representation of a wilderness that was about to be developed. Since filming the daytime scenes at the site went very quickly, the crew changed the location of Jake's interrogation from the FBI office to the site to use the remaining time until the filming of the night scene. Barba and the crew also built the set serving as the Eppes family's bathroom especially for the episode. =Casting notes= According to series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci, Bill Nye served as an inspiration for both Numb3rs and for the character of Dr. Charlie Eppes. After reading Heuton and Falacci's claim about him in Wired Magazine in the spring of 2005, Nye, a fan of the series, had a breakfast meeting with the series creators and discussed science. Nye guest starred as a CalSci combustion engineering professor. While filming the episode, Nye convinced producers to let him include an explanation of backdrafts. After his guest appearance, he wanted to return for another episode. Also, \\"Scorched\\" was the first appearance of actress Sophina Brown in the series. In the episode, she portrayed a leader in the ELM. During season five, she was cast as series regular FBI Special Agent Nikki Betancourt. After casting her, casting director Mark Saks learned of her earlier appearance on the series. Reception Critically, the episode received a positive reception. Angel Cohn of TVGuide.com stated that the episode was \\"pretty fun to watch\\" and had \\"plenty of fun stuff\\". Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict called \\"Scorched\\" a \\"tight episode\\".

History  WITCC was founded in 1966. It first became an accredited institution in 1977, under The Higher Learning Commission, which is part of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2015, the college added a culinary program with associated instruction area, state-of-the-art test kitchen, and dining area. The program graduated its first class in 2016 with 100% placement. Classes emphasize sanitation, safety, knife skills, culinary techniques, baking, purchasing, management, and related topics.  Campus  The main campus is located near the corner of Stone Avenue and Gordon Drive in Sioux City. WITCC also has two main branch campuses in Denison, Iowa and Cherokee, Iowa, where there is also an on-campus conference center. Mapleton, Iowa and LeMars, Iowa also have \\"learning centers\\" that offer only a small number of classes. WITCC also offers online distance learning programs. The college has undergone extensive renovations in recent years. The student learning environments in the Kiser Building and community meeting area in the Corporate College have been re-done. In 2014, another housing complex, Prairie Place, was added to the Sioux City Campus and a permanent WITCC Le Mars Center was opened. A new student life and wellness center was opened in January 2012, named the Dunker Center after President Emeritus Dr. Robert E. Dunker. The two-story, 44,000 sq. foot facility contains a basketball court, two cross-court basketball courts, a volleyball court, and a three-lane walking/jogging track. Along the edges is a cardio fitness area with elliptical machines and treadmills, as well as a strength training room with free weights and Nautilus-style equipment. The college offers a selection of fitness classes in these facilities, made possible largely due to a challenge grant from The Kresge Foundation as well as community support. =Student housing= WITCC has three residence halls, Sun Ridge Court, Bur Oak Suites, and Prairie Place. The three areas can house a combined total of around 540 students. Sun Ridge Court provides apartment- style housing, with one- and two-bedroom apartment units, and also family- style housing. Bur Oak Suites offers more traditional housing options, with four-bedroom/two-bath suites. Bur Oak Suites was erected in 2008 and includes common areas, a computer lab, a music room, a study room, and a community kitchen. The Prairie Place residence hall, which opened in the fall of 2014, is similar to Bur Oak Suites in size and layout. Student life In the fall of 2010, credit student enrollment was 6,421, a growth of ten percent from the previous year. Students' credit hours were evenly divided between arts/sciences and career technical programs. There were also nearly 200 faculty. WITCC offers associate degrees, diplomas, and certificates in no fewer than 170 programs. Athletics are composed of intramural sports and a few club sports that compete as the WITCC Comets. The institution is part of the Iowa Community College Online Consortium, a group of community colleges from across the state that work together to give students opportunities for online education.

His arrest took place on the first day students could not withdraw from classes and housing for a full refund.ABC News. Good Morning America. Mystery at Eastern Michigan University Aftermath =Violation of the Clery Act= A subsequent investigation by Detroit law firm Butzel Long found that EMU had violated the Clery Act by not notifying students and named Jim Vick, Vice President of Student Affairs, as the main source of the cover-up. The report led to investigation of many high-level administrators. On July 3, 2007 the Department of Education report relating to the Clery Act violations was released to the public. It states, \\"Several findings of noncompliance were discovered during the review which the Department [of Education] considers to be serious violations of the Clery Act.\\" The result of this report has yet to be seen.

The products aim to help pupils focus in the classroom by ensuring that they stay hydrated, eat healthy food, sit comfortably and are in the best state to learn. The products include: The Bottlecoolerpenholder; a thermally insulating wet-suit style jacket for water bottles, which stores stationery and acts as a reminder for children to drink plenty of water during lessons. The Chairpadbag; a bag that doubles as a padded seat cover to make hard plastic chairs more comfortable. The Food for Thought Lunchbox; which encourages children to eat more fruit and the Lunchbox Cooler; a thermally insulating bag that ensures that the contents of a lunchbox stay cool and palatable before eating. Other products include a USB stick in the shape of a brain which lights up with a brightness corresponding to according to how much data is on it, DIY Reflective Stickers that pupils can cut out and customise their bags, bikes or scooters with, and a range of Anti-Smell Sports Bags, which contains a charcoal odour absorbing patch to ensure sports kits left at school remains as fragrant as possible.

Sustainability  Nyatoh is generally perceived as a sustainable resource.

Series writer Ken Sanzel drew inspiration for the episode from pursuit curves. \\"Spree\\" also launches a more general trend toward the serialization of the series. David Gallagher and Kim Dickens guest-starred as the couple. For Gallagher, the role of Buck Winters was a sharp contrast with his role in a previous series. Lou Diamond Phillips, reprising his role of FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton, made his third appearance on Numb3rs. \\"Spree\\" first aired in the United States on September 22, 2006. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. Plot summary A recently married couple, Buck Winters (David Gallagher) and Crystal Hoyle (Kim Dickens), shoot the people inside a convenience store outside of Los Angeles, California and drive off in a stolen a convertible. Some time later, FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton (Lou Diamond Phillips) informs FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Megan Reeves (Diane Farr), David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) that Crystal and Buck have been on a 17-day robbery spree from Texas to Los Angeles. Don and Ian take a map to CalSci and ask Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Don's brother and a FBI math consultant, for assistance. Charlie gets an idea that Ian missed a shooting in Wyoming. At the office, the team learns that Crystal was Buck's high school teacher and that they killed Buck's father before beginning their robbery spree. A call stating that Crystal and Buck were involved in a shootout in a Wyoming bar confirms Charlie's suspicion and fills in a gap in the timeline. A background check reveals that Crystal, along with her friend Lydia Campos (Georgia Hatzis), was arrested for drug possession in Los Angeles at age 15. Meanwhile, Buck and Crystal drive into a downtown car dealership belonging to Pierce Brenner (Jerry D. O'Donnell). Brenner recognizes Crystal, and she shoots him. After arriving on the scene, Megan realizes that Crystal and Buck's actions have been changing since Ian started following them. Meanwhile, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, contemplates moving into a condo, citing privacy issues and the need to invest the money from the sale of the house. Also, Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat) tells Charlie that she is accepting the CalSci associate professor's position extended to her some time earlier, enabling Charlie and Amita to start dating. While telling his friend and colleague Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) about these changes and the idea about the Wyoming shooting, Charlie becomes inspired to use pursuit curves to model Crystal and Buck's as well as Ian's movements throughout the western United States. The team stakes out Campos' house and learns through a wiretap that Crystal is going to a meth house. Buck and Crystal grab some grenades and blow up the meth house. Crystal calls Campos again, and Campos tries to talk Crystal out of leaving a bag of drugs and cash outside Campos' house. Unwilling to let Crystal kill Campos, David and Colby take Campos into custody. At the FBI office, Campos tells them that Brenner was connected to the meth dealers and that Billy Rivers, Crystal's boyfriend after her relationship with Brenner, was charged along with Crystal and Campos. Charlie assumes that Crystal and Buck are after something else, and the team realizes that Crystal wants to eliminate anyone and anything connected to her past \\"mistakes\\". This makes Rivers a target, and the team race to find him. After narrowing down the number of places where Rivers could be, the team stakes out the house of Rivers' cousin. Ian cautions Megan about not letting Crystal's background influence Megan's perception of the case. Buck arrives, and Ian shoots Buck in the wrist. Buck is then taken to jail. Megan meets Larry at an all-night caf√© for an early breakfast, and they discuss Megan's own decision to leave home at the age of 16. After Larry leaves, Crystal appears and carjacks Megan. Production =Writing= \\"Spree\\" and the following episode \\"Two Daughters\\" were originally written as one episode. Numb3rs series writer Ken Sanzel based the original script on the concept of pursuit curves. When Sanzel sent the script to the network, CBS executives requested that he divide the script into two parts. The second part became \\"Two Daughters\\". \\"Spree\\" had two differences in storytelling. Beginning with season three, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci decided to serialize the show in terms of character's lives. Since the series already delved into the personal lives and relationships of the characters, serialization was a natural progression in the development of the series. Also, \\"Spree\\" marked the first time in which the story was told from the criminal's viewpoint. =Casting= David Gallagher was cast as Buck Winters, and Kim Dickens was cast as Crystal Hoyle. Looking to show more acting depth than exhibited in his previous role in 7th Heaven, Gallagher auditioned for the role of Buck Winters. The casting director noted the difference in roles but awarded Gallagher with the role. Kim Dickens, formerly of Deadwood, auditioned and won the role of Crystal. Dickens enjoyed the role so much that she was disappointed in not being able to return. Lou Diamond Phillips reprised his role of FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton. The episode marked Edgerton's third appearance on Numb3rs. Reception When the episode premiered, 11.42 million people in the United States watched \\"Spree\\", beating Law & Order by about 490,000 viewers. Critically, the episode was very well received. Although she called Gallagher \\"out-of-character\\", Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict seemed to enjoy the episode. Jeffrey Robinson, a DVD Talk reviewer, called \\"Spree\\" \\"[o]ne of the season's strongest episodes\\". Grouping \\"Spree\\" and \\"Two Daughters\\" together, Donald Liebenson, an Amazon.com editor, called \\"Spree\\" \\"compelling\\".

With five Pro Tour top eights and 27 Grand Prix top eights (including seven wins), Watanabe is best known for his Rookie of the Year title in 2007, and his Player of the Year titles in 2009 and 2012. He is one of only three players to become Player of the Year more than once. He was elected to the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame in 2016, along with Owen Turtenwald, but removed in May 2019 after a cheating scandal involving marked card sleeves.  Career  Watanabe's professional Magic career began in 2007 at Grand Prix Kyoto. He emerged as the champion from a top eight of relatively unknown players, something former Player of the Year Kenji Tsumura had predicted on day one of the tournament. This qualified him for his first Pro Tour, Yokohama, held about a month later. Despite not making another top eight that season at either the Pro Tour or Grand Prix level, strong finishes at Pro Tour San Diego (22nd) with teammate Shuhei Nakamura, and at Pro Tour Valencia (21st) were enough for him to win the Rookie of the Year title. The following season Watanabe did not perform as well on the Pro Tour, with a 35th-place finish at the World Championship being his best finish. However, off Tour he did have some stand-out finishes. A third place standing at the Japanese National Championship earned him a place on the Japanese national team. Along with his national team colleagues Masashi Oiso and Akihiro Takakuwa, Watanabe made the semifinals of the national team competition at Worlds, where Japan lost to the United States team. In 2009, Watanabe achieved a strong season, though the first half was somewhat unimpressive. He was able to offset the deficit of earning only the minimum two Pro Points at Kyoto and Honolulu with a second-place finish behind Tomoharu Saitou at Grand Prix Kobe. The second half on the other hand was nothing short of spectacular, with Watanabe making the top eight in six consecutive premier level events. The run began with a second-place finish at Japanese Nationals behind his San Diego teammate Shuhei Nakamura. After this finish, Watanabe made the top eight of four back-to-back Grand Prix in Bangkok, Niigata, Prague, and Melbourne, winning the last of these. This gave him the lead in the player of the year race going into Pro Tour Austin, and made him the first non-Australian to win a Grand Prix in Australia. A year and a half after his Pro Tour debut, Watanabe made his first Pro Tour top eight at Pro Tour Austin. He lost his quarterfinal match in five games to Hunter Burton. After a 62nd-place finish at the next event, Grand Prix Tampa, Watanabe pick up right where he left off with another Grand Prix top eight in Kitakyushu. Despite not doing very well at the World Championship, finishing 101st individually and 7th with the Japanese team that were favourites to win the tournament, none of Watanabe's competitors for Player of the Year were able to capitalise, and he was awarded the title at the end of the tournament. During the 2012 season, his most successful season yet, Watanabe reached three Grand Prix top 8s, winning two of them (Kuala Lumpur and Manila) and thus securing his participation, as the Japanese player with the most Pro Points, to the first Magic Players Championship, which he eventually won by defeating his fellow countryman Shouta Yasooka in the final. Since the tournament replaced the briefly retired Pro Player of the Year title, Watanabe also became the second Magic player after Kai Budde to earn this title more than once. Later that year, at Pro Tour Return to Ravnica, Watanabe got his second Pro Tour top eight, losing in the final to Stanislav Cifka. The next year's Players Championship was renamed to the World Championship, with Watanabe receiving an invitation as the winner of the Players Championship. He went on to finish 6th at the event. At Grand Prix Beijing 2014, Watanabe won his seventh Grand Prix title, equalling the all- time record for Grand Prix wins held by Kai Budde. With seven Grand Prix wins in 21 total Grand Prix Top 8s, six more than Kai Budde, Watanabe was for a time the most successful Grand Prix player in the history of the game, until Shuhei Nakamura won GP Dallas in July 2015. His performance during the season earned him an invitation to the 2014 World Championship. Watanabe started the next season strongly, making the top eight of the first Pro Tour of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir, where he lost in the quarterfinal to eventual champion Ari Lax. At the 2014 World Championship in December, Watanabe came close to becoming the first repeat World Champion, finishing the Swiss portion of the tournament in first place. However, it was his semifinal opponent Shahar Shenhar who would go on to claim his second Worlds title. He ended the season on 59 points, resulting in an eight-place finish in the Player of the Year standings, as well as an invitation to the 2015 World Championship. He was the only player to have qualified for the first 6 invite- only World Championships since the format change after the 2011 Pro Tour season. His streak was broken at the 2018 World Championship where he failed to qualify. Wantanabe was disqualified at Mythic Championship II for cheating by using marked card sleeves. After an investigation, Wizards of the Coast determined that he had intentionally marked several key cards in his deck, which would allow him to identify a card before drawing it and make decisions based on that information. As a consequence of this, they banned him from organized events for 30 months, removed him from the Magic Pro League, and removed him from the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame.

However, the Players Championship, which he won in 2012, was later changed to the World Championship, and Watanabe is therefore considered the 2012 World Champion.

It concerns resistance in the United States to a Nazi occupation. Plot The point of divergence occurs in 1940 when Nazi Germany forces France and the United Kingdom to surrender and takes control over their former empires. After Germany soon overruns all of the Soviet Union in 1941, both it and Japan attack and invade the United States later that year. President Burton K. Wheeler (who defeated Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940) surrenders the United States to the Axis after a devastating bombardment of missiles from occupied Canada. The surrender takes place on April 20, 1946, Adolf Hitler's fifty seventh birthday. President Wheeler, Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, and other government officials are executed by garrote in a meat packing plant outside of Washington, D.C. on July 24 of the same year (by using the method that was used for the 20 July plot conspirators in our timeline) after being found guilty of war crimes. In the former US government's place is a puppet government akin to what happened in our timeline to the Czech part of Czechoslovakia during the German occupation. Thirty years later in 1976, Hideki Tojo and Adolf Hitler are preparing to board trains that will carry them to their historic meeting marking the 30th anniversary of their victory over the United States. The celebration is to be held at The Divide, a small town that is exactly equidistant between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, at the somewhat uneasy boundary the two empires. Its code name is The Divide. The division is both geographical and cultural. Germany has integrated the eastern part of defeated America into the Greater German Reich while the western part is occupied by Japan, as part of the Greater Co-prosperity Sphere and more a colony than anything else. In both cases, the subjugation is almost complete. The story commences with the assassination of the Japanese general who conquered the area by using methods like those of Tomoyuki Yamashita in Malaya and Masaharu Homma in the Philippines. The story then moves back and forth between the two areas of occupation, but the emphasis is heavily on the German side. The plot centers on the efforts of an anti-partisan officer of the SS who tries to find the perpetrators of the assassination and to determine if it is a harbinger of actions at the Tojo-Hitler meeting. As the action moves forward, information appears on the details of the new German-American synthesis. It is a land of Europeans; the end result of a \\"Final Solution,\\" which encompassed most other minorities, including Native Americans and blacks. What occurred in the Japanese sector is never completely addressed but it is hinted that the ethnic cleansing took place, though in a less industrialized manner, like the Rape of Nanjing instead of death camps. After 30 years, the American people more or less accept or perhaps put up with the occupation. The resistance movement has elements scattered around the country in both occupied zones and have some inter-group communication. However, the groups are rarely not engaged in partisan activity. That is especially the case for the official component, a stay-behind military and scientific group that was charged by President Wheeler, just before the surrender in 1946, with a secret project that could, if successful, reverse the country's fortunes. Its task to develop a new weapon became, as the war ended and the new regimes take over, so important the group feared that any action would cause them to be discovered. Thus, doing nothing and remaining in what was more or less a prison, albeit a comfortable one, evolved into its mission long after the weapon was perfected. It falls, therefore, to newcomers, those who had carried out no act of rebellion in years, perhaps decades, to agitate its use. They, along with the surviving scientist, set out to ambush the trains. The outsiders and misanthropes even by the standards of the \\"survival-at-any-cost\\" members of the stay-behind head out with their device to try to change the course of history. The narrative occasionally contains third-person comments, which create a sense of the story being told after the fact. That is at odds with the rest of the narrative and is almost as if the author is acting as a Greek chorus of sorts and is puzzling, as it implies associated events outside the storyline but related to it. The puzzlement dissipates as the book comes to an end. The malcontents and disaffected and the disenfranchised and threatened unite in an act of rebellion that needed little more than a \\"hero\\" to act as the catalyst. What will happen remains unclear, but it is possible that the events are ongoing. Style The book is written in a style that easily evokes images. That is not surprising since the author's full-time job was as the writer and illustrator of a comic strip.

The team was the result of a 1919 merger between the Phoenixville Union Club and the upstart Phoenix Athletic Club. From 1907 until 1919, the Union Club was considered one of the best football teams in eastern Pennsylvania. However, in 1919 the upstart Phoenix Athletic Club signed many of the top players of the area, leaving the Union Club no choice but to merge with the Phoenix A.C. The team is best known for defeating the Canton Bulldogs 14-7, in 1920. The team however would fold in 1921. History =Origins= In 1907 the Phoenixville Union Club fielded its first football team. The team frequently played rival clubs from Schuylkill County, as well as teams from Philadelphia and New Jersey. Within a few years, the Union Club became one of the strongest teams in the region. Several times they were declared the mythical \\"Champions of the Schuylkill Valley\\" and \\"Champions of Eastern Pennsylvania\\". However, the team experienced tragedy on occasion. In November 1913, George Gay, a star player for the Ursinus College football team, died from a neck injury three days after it was broken in a Phoenixille-Pottstown game. He broke his neck after being tackled from behind. =The merger= World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic had a severe impact on Phoenixville's 1917 football season. The team had only managed to schedule 5 games in 1917, while only one game was played in 1918. In 1919, the Union Club and the new Phoenix Athletic Club merged. The merger began when the Phoenix Athletic Club signed away many of the area's top football players. This left Union in a dilemma. In 1919, Union played what should have been an easy game against a local high school. However that game resulted in scoreless tie. As a result, the Union Club merged with the Phoenix A. C. Meanwhile, the Union Club of Phoenixville ended their 1919 season with a 6-0-3 record. The final game of the season against the Conshohocken Athletic Club, ended in a scoreless tie. However Phoenixville, managed to sign many ex-college players to their roster including; Heinie Miller of Penn and Butch Spagna of Lehigh University. =1920= The 1920 Phoenixville Club fielded many of the top players of the era. These players included Lou Little, Lud Wray, Fats Eyrich, Bodie Weldon, Heinie Miller, Earl Potteiger, Stan Cofall and future Hall of Famer, Fritz Pollard. The club also fielded several members (eight in all, including Ockie Anderson and Swede Youngstrom) of the Buffalo All-Americans of the National Football League; Pollard and Cofall also had NFL jobs, Pollard with the Akron Pros and Cofall with the Cleveland Tigers. The NFL players would play a non- league game with Phoenixville on Saturdays, then hop the train for Buffalo or Ohio and the next day‚Äôs game. This arrangement helped the All-Americans earn extra money. Incidentally, the team had been organized by Bert Bell, the future NFL commissioner and Philadelphia Eagles owner, but Bell had planned to play the team as the \\"Philadelphia Collegians\\" before Phoenixville's managers came and signed all of Bell's players. The Phoenixville club went 11-0 in 1920. The team defeated several local teams, including their rivals, the Conshohocken Athletic Club, Holmesburg Athletic Club, and the pre-NFL Frankford Yellow Jackets. However, the team still had the biggest game of the year, and in team history, to play. The Canton Bulldogs game At the end of the 1920 season, Phoenixville fans began to wonder how their team stacked up to the best teams of the era. Prior to 1920, the Canton Bulldogs were considered the best pro football team in world. The team featured Joe Guyon and the legendary Jim Thorpe, both future Pro Football Hall of Famers. The team was also not only a member of the mythical Ohio League, which consisted of the best teams in pro football, but won the league's championship in 1916, 1917 and 1919. On either December 11 or December 12, 1920, an estimated 17,000 fans turned out to watch the Union Club and Canton Bulldogs play at the Baker Bowl. Despite the Bulldogs scoring first off of a Pete Calac touchdown, the Phoenixville soon gained control of the game with a fumble recovery by Heinie Miller. That play set up a Stan Cofall touchdown pass to Lou Hayes. Later in the third quarter, Cofall blocked a Guyon punt which was returned for another touchdown by Hayes. While Canton did manage a late game drive to the Phoenixville 20 yard line, a Guyon fumble, was recovered by Phoenxiville's Heinie Miller. Phoenixville would go on to win the game 14-7. Despite their victory, the Union Club could not claim any national professional championship based upon the outcome of the Canton game. The 1920 Canton Bulldogs were just not the dominant football team that they had been in previous seasons. In the NFL, the Akron Pros, Decatur Staleys (renamed the Chicago Bears in 1922) and the Buffalo All-Americans had all placed higher ahead of the Bulldogs in the standings. Leo Conway appeared at the NFL's organizational meetings in April 1921, representing Phoenixville, where the league's championship was awarded to Akron by a vote.1921: Once More, with Feeling. Professional Football Researchers Association. Retrieved November 30, 2015. =1921 and closure= In 1921, the Union Club's status as a premier professional team disappeared. The club's board of directors rejected Heinie Miller's proposal to for the team to reform with a similar 1920 lineup for the 1921 season. The club instead opted to field a less costly team of mostly local talent. The Big Red went on to a 5-2-0 record in what turned out to be its final season. However Miller, managed to keep most of the 1920 team intact and fielded them in 1921 as the Union Quakers of Philadelphia in 1921.

Almost immediately, SR 91 (Philema Road) leaves to the northeast, and SR 133 continues to the northwest. It crosses over the western part of Lake Worth. Almost immediately the highway enters Lee County. Finally, it continues northwest for a little while until it meets its northern terminus, an intersection with US 19/SR 3 (Walnut Street), north of Albany. All of SR 133 from its southern terminus in Valdosta until the point it leaves the Liberty Expressway in Albany is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Future Urban stretches of SR 133 are four-laned and undivided. Rural stretches of the route are currently two-laned. The GDOT has plans to widen all rural stretches of SR 133 by 2018. Major intersections Related route State Route 133 Alternate (SR 133 Alternate) is a connector route that exists entirely within the central part of Colquitt County. It is known as Old Doerun Road for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 319 Business/SR 33 (North Main Street) in downtown Moultrie. It heads west and curves to the northwest to meet SR 111 (West Bypass) in the northwest part of the city. The highway travels through rural areas until it meets the SR 133 mainline in a rural part of Colquitt County, northwest of Moultrie. SR 133 Alternate is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

He is the founder and current CEO of Republic Records. Over the course of his career, he has worked with a wide range of artists, including James Blake, Drake, Florence + the Machine, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Amy Winehouse, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Pearl Jam, Jack Johnson, John Mellencamp, and numerous others. He is the brother of Avery Lipman. Early life and education Lipman grew up partially in Montclair, New Jersey and graduated from Montclair High School. After high school, Lipman went to college at the University at Albany where he served on the university's concert board. There, he was in charge of finding acts to perform on campus and setting up concert events. He graduated in 1986 with a degree in communication and rhetoric. Career =1986‚Äì2000: Career beginnings and first Republic Records run= After college, Lipman worked at a variety of record labels over the course of 9 years. In 1995, Lipman co- founded Republic Records with his younger brother, Avery. The first act they signed was Bloodhound Gang. KROQ in Los Angeles picked up the band's record, \\"Fire Water Burn.\\" Their next client was Chumbawamba. After listening to a demo of the band's album, Tubthumper, the Lipman brothers immediately offered to sign them to a deal on their imprint, a co-venture with Universal Records. The band's album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This began the Lipmans' long-term relationship with Universal Music in which they have held positions at the organization in one form or another since then. Other major acts signed in Republic's early years included 3 Doors Down and Godsmack (among others). =2000‚Äì2012: President of Universal Records and Universal Republic= In January 2000, Lipman was named the President of Universal Records, and Republic Records was folded into that company. Early in his tenure, Lipman oversaw Universal Records' first Billboard 200 number one album with Nelly's Country Grammar. In his first six years there, Lipman oversaw acts like Jack Johnson, Lil Wayne, Hinder, and Damien Marley along with Republic holdovers, 3 Doors Down and Godsmack (among others). In 2006, Universal Records was merged into Republic, forming the label Universal Republic Records. Lipman became the President and CEO of that new entity. In that role, Lipman signed artists like Amy Winehouse, Colbie Caillat, India Arie, Mika, Enrique Iglesias, and Florence + the Machine by 2011. Lipman also formed strategic alliances with other labels in order to cross-promote musicians, including Taylor Swift and The Band Perry with Big Machine Records and Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Lil Wayne with Cash Money Records. In 2011, Lipman came across videos of Ariana Grande singing cover songs on YouTube and was so impressed by her vocals that he went on to sign her to a recording contract. =2012‚Äìpresent: Return to Republic name= In 2012, Lipman helped produce the soundtrack for the film, The Hunger Games. That year, his record company returned to its original name, Republic Records. By 2013, Lipman had added artists like Gotye, PSY, and The Weeknd to the Republic fold. In February 2013, Lipman signed another new contract to remain with Republic Records and was also given the new title of Chairman and CEO of the company. In 2014, releases from Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift along with a variety of soundtracks led Republic to become Nielsen's number 1 label in market share. In 2015, Lipman led Republic Records to topping Billboard lists for Top Label and Top Hot 100 Label (among others). The label was, in fact, named the Top Hot 100 Label by Billboard each year from 2014 to 2018. In July 2018, Republic held the top three spots on the Billboard 200 list, a feat that had not been accomplished in 15 years. Drake's Scorpion was number 1, Florence + the Machine's High as Hope number 2, and Post Malone's Beerbongs & Bentleys number 3. In November 2018, Lipman signed Taylor Swift to Republic Records. Her music had been released by Big Machine Records in partnership with Republic since 2007. Philanthropy Outside of music, Lipman is engaged in numerous philanthropic causes. He sits on the boards of the Amy Winehouse Foundation; the T.J. Martell Foundation (which honored him with the \\"Humanitarian of the Year\\" award in 2010); the UJA-Federation of New York (which named him 2015's \\"Music Visionary of the Year\\"); and DKMS (Delete Blood Cancer). In 2016, Lipman and his wife Angelina were honored at the 10th Annual DKMS Gala for their contributions to the organization. Among other honors, Lipman also received the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's \\"Spirit of Hope Award\\" in 2017 and was one of four honorees at the 2018 Angel Ball.

These camps supported the non-communist resistance spearheaded by Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF).Normand, Roger, \\"Inside Site 2,\\" Journal of Refugee Studies, 1990;3:2:156-162, p. 158. However, Site Two was intended as a civilian camp and the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF) were based in other locations.Reynell J. Political Pawns: Refugees on the Thai-Kampuchean Border. Oxford: Refugee Studies Programme, 1989. One section of the camp was reserved for Vietnamese refugees and beginning in January 1988 Thailand transferred Vietnamese boat people directly to Site Two.Robinson, p. 96.Vietnamese Refugee Camps at Thailand-Cambodia border Between 1989 and 1991 the camp's population went from 145,000 to over 198,000.\\"Site II Demographic Survey,\\" Camp services Initially programs at Site Two were limited to the most basic support services: medical care, public health programs, sanitation, construction, and skills training in areas directly related to the running of the camp. This was in keeping with the Thai policy of \\"humane deterrence\\": the principle that the camps should not become permanent settlements or provide a level of assistance beyond what the refugees could expect to find in Cambodia. Camp services were mostly provided by the American Refugee Committee (ARC), Catholic Office for Emergency Relief and Refugees (COERR), Concern, Christian Outreach (COR), Handicap International, the International Rescue Committee, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the Japan International Volunteer Center (JVC), Malteser-Hilfsdienst Auslandsdienst (MHD), M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, Operation Handicap International (OHI), the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Japan Sotoshu Relief Committee (JSRC), and YWAM.\\"Services at Site II,\\" These organizations were coordinated by UNBRO, which was directly responsible for the distribution of food and water. =Food and water= On a per person basis rice, canned or dried fish, one egg and a vegetable were distributed weekly at Site Two; dried beans, oil, salt, and wheat flour were given once a month.Reynell, J., \\"Socio- economic Evaluation of the Khmer camps on the Thai/Kampuchean Border,\\" Oxford University Refugee Studies Programme. Report Commissioned by World Food Programme, Rome, 1986. Exact amounts for the weekly and monthly rations in 1990 were as follows: * Rice: 3.4 kilograms/week * Eggs: 100 grams/week * Vegetables: 500 grams/week * Fish products: 210 grams/week * Dry beans: 500 grams/month * Oil: 700 grams/month * Salt: 280 grams/month * Wheat flour: 700 grams/month Water was a particular problem at Site Two. UNBRO constructed a large reservoir at Ban Wattana, approximately 12 kilometers from the camp. Most of Site Two's water was trucked in from this reservoir but in the dry season even this source was insufficient for the camp's needs. Late in 1990, UNBRO began drilling several deep wells in the camp, which ultimately provided much of the camp's water. =Health services= Medical services were provided by 5 dirt-floored, thatched bamboo hospitals and 8 outpatient clinics staffed by doctors and nurses from international voluntary agencies as well as Khmer medics and nurses. There was no surgical facility and surgical emergencies were referred to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) hospital at Khao-I-Dang,Soffer, Allen and Wilde, Henry, \\"Medicine in Cambodian Refugee Camps,\\" Annals of Internal Medicine, 1986;105:618-621, p. 619. although family members of KPNLAF soldiers could obtain medical and surgical care at the Chiang Daoy Military Hospital, just outside the camp on the northern perimeter. =Education= Education at Site Two progressed slowly due to the Thai Government's policy of \\"humane deterrence\\" which discouraged programs and services that would attract refugees from Kampuchea. In 1988, with the agreement of the Royal Thai Government, UNBRO launched a major new educational assistance program, focusing at the primary level and providing support for curriculum development, the printing of educational materials, teacher training and the training of teacher trainers, the provision of supplies and the construction and equipment of classrooms. By early 1989 the school system consisted of some fifty primary schools with an enrollment of approximately 70,000 pupils; three middle schools (coll√®ges) and three high schools (lyc√©es) with approximately 7,000 students, and more than 10,000 adults in literacy and vocational skills programs. Instruction was provided in Khmer by some 1,300 primary and over 300 secondary teachers recruited almost entirely from within the camps.Gyallay-Pap, Peter, \\"Reclaiming a Shattered Past: Education for the Displaced Khmer in Thailand,\\" Journal of Refugee Studies, 1989;2:2:257-275, p. 266. =Security= The Khmer Police took care of traditional police functions within Site Two.

The second half of a two-episode storyline, the episode features the aftermath of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent's abduction, which results in the search for not only the agent and her kidnapper but also for the true motive of the spree killings in the previous episode. As a character development, one FBI Special Agent's actions during the case created a story arc for that character for season three. Series writer Ken Sanzel used the trawler problem, a real-life application used to find traveling boats, as inspiration for the mathematics included in the episode. Originally written as one episode, Sanzel had to split the episode into two parts. While filming the episode, Sanzel and director Alex Zakrzewski learned that they had to consider Farr's recently discovered pregnancy, as it would affect the episode's action scenes. Also, due to the nature of the episode, Sanzel and Zakrzewski attempted to be sensitive to the audience's reaction to the violence depicted in the episode. \\"Two Daughters\\" first aired in the United States on September 29, 2006. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. One critic loved the character developments in the episode. Plot summary FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno), along with Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Don's younger brother and a FBI math consultant, arrive at the scene of an abandoned stolen van at an all-night caf√© and notice that fellow FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) is late. Don receives a call from Crystal Hoyle (Kim Dickens) that she wants her husband, Buck Winters (David Gallagher), released in exchange for Megan, who has been kidnapped. The team runs back to the office. Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's friend and colleague and Megan's boyfriend, is visibly upset and calls David \\"artless\\" when David tries to comfort Larry. Over Colby's objection, Don allows FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton (Lou Diamond Phillips) to use force to coerce Buck into telling the agents Crystal's previous location. There, Colby and Ian find Megan's empty car in the garage, but not Megan. At a hotel where Crystal took Megan, Megan learns that Crystal had an affair with Brennan and was forced to give their daughter up for adoption. Megan also learns that Crystal wants to be reunited with the girl. Meanwhile, the team questions Crystal's then-boyfriend Billy Rivers (Mark Rosenthal) and his attorney. The team learns that Brennan arranged a black market adoption for Crystal's daughter through Rivers' attorney. After Ian roughs up Rivers during the interview, Don tells Charlie that he has violated his ethics, and Charlie cautions Don about the unintended consequences of Don's actions. Charlie then suggests that Don can use the caf√©, the garage, and the place where Crystal dumped Megan's cell phone as starting points for a search. During the team's search, Megan alerts the team to her and Crystal's location through a 9-1-1 call about gunshots in a room. The team finds Megan, whom Crystal leaves bleeding in an empty hotel room, and rushes her to the hospital, where they, Charlie, and Larry visit her. At Charlie's house, Don tells his father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), what he did and asks whether it was possible to start doing the right thing again. Alan's response is that Don's actions were a result of the concern for his team and that it is possible for Don to start doing the right thing again. Don then tells Alan that he likes being at the house, hence his frequent visits. Colby learns that Crystal used Megan's identity to track down Rivers' attorney. While leaving the hospital, Megan and Larry determine that they need to analyze the potential adopted parents of Crystal's daughter as the parents would have been interested in establishing a normal life for her after her black market adoption. Charlie and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's girlfriend and colleague, use a sorting algorithm that sorted social security numbers to locate her. Meanwhile, the team finds Rivers's attorney dead. Crystal arrives at her daughter's house and considers her plan. When Megan arrives at the house, Crystal calls Megan and asks to talk to Buck. Using the GPS chip in Crystal's cell phone, the team learns that Crystal is bound for Mexico and sets up a road block. At the roadblock, Crystal calls Megan one last time to tell her to leave the area, but Megan stays with her team. Crystal drives toward the roadblock with a live grenade when she suddenly dies after being shot in the head before the grenade explodes seconds later. Much to the team and Ian's surprise, it's revealed that Don was the one who pulled the trigger. At Charlie's house, Alan finds the brothers arguing over a video game and tells them that he is staying at the house because he likes their company. Production =Writing= Originally, series writer Ken Sanzel wrote \\"Spree\\" and \\"Two Daughters\\" as one episode. In the original story, a female law enforcement officer was kidnapped about halfway through the episode, and, at the end of the episode, Ian fatally shot Crystal. When CBS network executives read the script, they suggested that the episode should be a two- part episode. Sanzel split the script. He decided to place Megan in danger, marking the first time that a main character on Numb3rs was in serious danger. During a production meeting, executive producer Barry Schindel made the suggestion for Don to shoot Crystal instead of Ian. Sanzel originally disliked the idea but made the change since Don's shot would characterize Don. Sanzel included several character developments in the episode. He wrote Charlie and Amita's discussion of their relationship as a plot development. Sanzel also included the scene where Don and Alan talk about Don's tendency to go to Charlie's house. Throughout the first two seasons, writers either developed reasons for Don to be there or failed to explain Don's presence there. Sanzel wrote the scene to explain Don's constant presence at the house. Sanzel's scenes between Megan and Crystal were similar to the ones Sanzel wrote for Lone Hero. In the movie, the protagonist and the antagonist form a connection in spite of the antagonist being the protagonist's captive. In \\"Two Daughters\\", Sanzel reversed the roles, with Megan being Crystal's hostage. When writing the episode, Sanzel was uncertain if CBS executives would allow Buck's interrogation due to the implicit violence of Ian's interrogation tactic. He felt that the scene was a risk to the series. CBS executives approved the scene as it raised questions for Don. Buck's interrogation affected Don for the entire season. In an episode that aired later in season three, Sanzel, who wrote the episode, included the incident in one of Don's therapy sessions. Since \\"Spree\\" was based on the concept of pursuit curves, Sanzel based included a variation called the trawler problem in \\"Two Daughters\\". The trawler problem is a real-life application of pursuit curves used to find slow-travelling boats. =Casting= The rewrite of the script allowed three people to appear in both episodes. David Gallagher reprised his role as Buck Winters, and Kim Dickens reprised her role as Crystal Hoyle. Marking his fourth appearance on the series, Lou Diamond Phillips reprised his role as FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton. =Filming= Although director John Behring directed \\"Spree\\", director Alex Zakrzewski directed \\"Two Daughters\\". Behring finished filming \\"Spree\\" on a Friday, and Zakrzewski began filming \\"Two Daughters\\" on the following Monday. Having already developed a plan, Zakrzewski filmed scenes quickly. He also accepted suggestions from the actors. While filming Buck's interrogation scene several times, Zakrzewski initially shot Phillips walking into the interrogation room without showing Phillips' face. Upon Phillips' suggestion, Zakrzewski then filmed Phillips' face as he walked into the interrogation room. When filming began on the episode, Diane Farr learned that she was pregnant. Farr told series executive producer Barry Schindel and several people on set, including Sanzel, about the pregnancy. She and the producers discussed her level of physical activity during the action scenes. During the scene where Crystal fired a gun at Megan, they used a stunt double to kick Crystal. Due to the level of violence in the episode, the producers attempted to balance the audience's sensitivities with reality. Producers and Sanzel discussed the type of cut on Megan's arm. They also discussed the amount of blood that was to be shown in both the scene where the team rescues Megan and the scene where David and Colby find the dead attorney. The amount of blood was added during post-production. Reception Over 10.69 million people in the United States watched \\"Two Daughters\\". Critically, the episode was very well received. Calling both \\"Spree\\" and \\"Two Daughters\\" \\"stand-alone\\", Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict seemed to enjoy the episode. Stating that the episode's appeal was in the effects of the case on the team, Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk called \\"Two Daughters\\" \\"[o]ne of the season's strongest episodes\\". Donald Liebenson, an editor for Amazon.com, called \\"Two Daughters\\" \\"compelling\\".

In 1956, Mallory was a founder and spokesperson of the \\"Harlem 9\\", a group of African-American mothers who protested the inferior and inadequate conditions in segregated New York City schools. Inspired by a report by Kenneth and Mamie Clark on inexperienced teachers, overcrowded classrooms, dilapidated conditions, and gerrymandering to promote segregation in New York, the group sought to transfer their children to integrated schools that offered higher quality resources. \\"Harlem 9\\" activism included lawsuits against the city and state, filed with the help of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). By 1958 it escalated to public protests and a 162-day boycott involving 10,000 parents. The boycott campaign did not win formal support from the NAACP, but was assisted by leaders such as Ella Baker and Adam Clayton Powell, and endorsed by African-American newspapers such as the Amsterdam News.Patrick G. Coy (ed.), Research in Social Movements, Conflicts and Change (Emerald Group, 2011), pp. 305-312. While the children were engaged in another boycott in 1960, the campaign established some of the first freedom schools of the civil rights movement to educate them. New York City retaliated against the mothers, trying and failing to prosecute them for negligence. In 1960, Mallory and the Harlem 9 won their lawsuit, and the Board of Education allowed them, and over a thousand other parents, to transfer their children to integrated schools. That year, the Board of Education announced a general policy of Open Enrollment, and thousands more black children transferred to integrated schools over the next five years.

In 1927 he married Esther Hanson, who was thirty years his junior, and within the next few years he had an apartment added to the rear of the studio to serve as their living quarters. The studio was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its local significance in architecture and commerce. It was nominated for being one of the few surviving examples of an early-20th-century photography studio.

After offers from various record labels the band ultimately decided to set up their own record label Armoured Records giving the band complete creative control, yet the ability to reach a mass audience with EMI contracted to distribute the album.EMI contracted to distribute The Automatic /newsblog.thecmuwebsite.com, 10 November 2009 After touring in November 2008 the band returned to the studio, only four months after the release of This Is a Fix.19.09.09 Cardiff Barfly theautomatic.co.uk, 18 September 2009 Throughout the rest of 2008 and up until November 2009 the band worked from their Cardiff recording studio on new material, working on around some 20 ideas, which were eventually reduced to 11 album tracks and an unknown number of B-sides.The Automatic Man Sky Sports, 19 December 2009 After the writing and demoing stage, the band worked with Richard Jackson, the producer of a number of tracks on their previous albums Not Accepted Anywhere and This Is a Fix, describing Jackson as 'almost being the fifth member of the Automatic'.The Automatic Interview panicdots.com, 6 March 2010 The album was eventually recorded with Jackson and Stephen Davies at Warwick Hall Studios in Cardiff, and later mixed at Buffalo Studios and Machine Rooms in Cardiff. In the studio the band worked with Nathan Stone and Carly Worsfold, who provided string sections on the tracks \\"Run & Hide\\" and \\"High Time\\".Tear the Signs Down, ARMRD03CD, 2010, album sleeve Background =Lyrical themes= In an interview with Bedfordshire on Sunday vocalist & bassist Rob Hawkins summarised the lyrical construction of all three albums by the Automatic; with Not Accepted Anywhere being about personal experiences and growing up, This Is a Fix was largely based around news and world events, whilst Tear the Signs Down is more about story telling.There is so much more to this band than just a Monster hit bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010 Lyrically Tear the Signs Down is far more focused, as opposed to This Is a Fix, according to Paul Mullen. The lyrics themselves are mostly written by Hawkins and Mullen, however Iwan Griffiths and James Frost also had an input if a lyric didn't sit right with all four bandmates. Hawkins and Mullen went through Tear the Signs Down track by track for American website randomville.com, describing the lyrical content of each song on 2 March 2010. Lead track \\"Insides\\" is described by Paul Mullen as; \\"the end of a relationship and the inability to cope with that fact. The build up of anger and tension so that you are ready and primed to break and destroy\\", and is also noted as being very different to anything the band have previously produced. The lyrics in first single \\"Interstate\\" reflect American culture - taken from the band's experience of recording half of previous record This Is a Fix in West Hollywood, California with Butch Walker, the song comments on the Americans' attitude described by Mullen as a \\"sickly infectious 'sweet dude' attitude they have is a great attribute, anything goes, anything can happen\\", he also noted the verse section of \\"Interstate\\"; \\"every band is allowed a song where they go 'na na na' and 'oh yeah' this is ours\\" and that they won't be doing it again. \\"Cannot Be Saved\\" was penned by Hawkins and is about paranoia, described by Rob as \\"You know, like in the summer when everyone seems to be on edge and it feels like it could just kick off for no reason\\". The lyrics of \\"List\\" tell of how things need to go wrong sometimes in order to ultimately succeed, \\"It‚Äôs about experiencing a lack of your own importance in the world; about people lying to you to supposedly protect you but protect you from what? It's about having your eyes opened you could say\\", \\"List\\" then leads instrumentally into second single \\"Run & Hide\\" which Mullen describes as \\"a feeling, a moment of being to self conscious to let yourself go. It's about the way life can be all about seizing moments without having any guarantees, pushing through all that self- doubt and seeing what happens\\", similarly \\"High Time\\" penned by Mullen is about his lack of motivation; \\"it's about giving it a go. Whatever it is. Not putting it off, just fucking do it\\", and \\"Tear It Down\\" - the last song written and recorded for Tear the Signs Down is about \\"pulling yourself out of a bad situation, and shaping things how you want them. In that respect that's what the last year has been for us. A process of facing up to realities, dealing with them and taking charge\\".bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010 \\"Sweat Heat Noise\\", sung by Hawkins, is about the band's live hiatus after touring This Is a Fix in 2008; \\"it's an optimistic song, it's also about the frustration of waiting for that chance to prove yourself again\\". The lyrics of \\"Race to the Heart of the Sun\\" came from Hawkins; \\"I had a revelation when I was falling asleep one night, that all human progress is a series of collisions - from cavemen using clubs as tools, to sex, to war to particle accelerators, to cooking everything. That's what this song is about\\". Mullen noted that the lyrics for \\"Can I Take You Home\\" came from an experience at the Egyptian pyramids, where he saw a German woman who he shared eye contact with for a moment. \\"Something Else\\" is musically and lyrically a nod towards the band's influences.EXCLUSIVE: THE AUTOMATIC GIVES US A TRACK-BY-TRACK OF THEIR NEW ALBUM TEAR THE SIGNS DOWN Randomville.com, 2 March 2010 =Style= Tear the Signs Down is closer to the style of the band's debut album Not Accepted Anywhere, with the use of more synthesizer parts and three-part-vocals from Hawkins, Frost and Mullen. The album uses the band's trademark pop hooks, with big choruses, whilst maintaining the band's rock edge, it is also the band's most diverse record yet, being compared to Soulwax and the Knife. First single \\"Interstate\\" bridges between This Is a Fix and Tear the Signs Down, with the lyrics referring to recording the previous album abroad in the US, the record as a whole has also been described as their most diverse yet.Return of the monster; The Automatic are back Wales Online, 11 November 2009the automatic break free for album no3 euronews.net, 10 December 2009 Single \\"Run & Hide\\" along with \\"High Time\\" and two interludes feature additional string instrumentalists.The Automatic Tear the Signs Down, \\"List\\", \\"Run & Hide\\", \\"High Time\\" 3 March 2010 Release The first track from Tear the Signs Down, \\"Something Else\\", was previewed on YouTube and the band's official website on 6 August 2009Best Laid Plans theautomatic.co.uk, youtube something else, 6 August 2009 Months later the album's release date was set for 15 February 2010 with the announcement of first single \\"Interstate\\" on 3 November 2009, along with the album's title Tear the Signs Down, as well as the first radio play of \\"Interstate\\" and the free download of album bonus track \\"Something Else\\".New single \\"Interstate and album announced\\" theautomatic.co.uk, 3 November 2009 On Soccer AM the band changed the album's release to 8 March 2010.

With the release of their second album This Is a Fix, the departure of Alex Pennie and arrival of Paul Mullen the band's sound had changed, which was something that B-Unique were not entirely happy with, as well as this record labels B-Unique and Polydor supposedly fell out leading towards This Is a Fix receiving barely any promotion. > You put a year of your life into making a record, then the label doesn't > tell anyone it's released or distribute it.

It is one of the largest medieval churches in the Haut-Rhin d√©partement of France. The church is also known as Saint-Arbogast Church (√âglise Saint-Arbogast). It lies on the \\"Route Romane d'Alsace\\". Although work started in the 11th century and was carried on with interruptions until 1870, the building remains unfinished.Inventaire g√©n√©ral du patrimoine culturel : √©glise paroissiale Notre-Dame de l' Assomption  History and architecture  The church is made of yellow and pink sandstone and was built in the Romanesque and Gothic styles, with Neo-Gothic additions. The oldest part of the building, the transept, dates from the second half of the 11th century; the nave is from the 12th and 13th century and displays both late Romanesque walls and early Gothic side portals; the choir is in late Gothic style. Work on the building both outside and inside continued until 1508; however, the twin-towered fa√ßade remained unfinished. A rood screen that had been built around 1300 was demolished in the 18th century and only two lateral staircases remain. Notre- Dame de l'Assomption suffered severe damage during the French Revolution and now appears relatively unadorned on both the outside and the inside. The large-scale volume of the church and the presence of several medieval building styles appear all the more evidently to the visitor. The Church is listed as a Monument historique since 1841 by the French Ministry of Culture. A comprehensive restoration of the building, which was undertaken from 1866 by the French architect Maximilien √âmile Mimey, had to be stopped in 1870 because of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. The planned heightening and completion of the double-towered fa√ßade was never carried out. Only the crest of the north tower was completed, in pink Vosges sandstone, in striking colour contrast to the yellow tower base.Eglise Notre-Dame de l‚ÄôAssomption de Rouffach A sacristy was added to the building after 1918.Website of the Rouffach parish The north tower is high, the south tower only . The top of the octagonal crossing tower, which was restored in 1854, reaches a height of . The total exterior length of the church is 68 meters as well, and the total interior length is .

The maximal exterior width is .Ehrhart, Jacques (with G√©rard Michel): Nouveau guide architectural et spirituel de Notre-Dame de l'Assomption, Imprimerie Rug√©, Mulhouse, n.d., distributed by the Rouffach parish  Furnishing  The great fa√ßade portal was vandalized during the French Revolution, when the statues and other sculptures that adorned it were shattered.A visiter et √† voir √† Rouffach : Notre-Dame de l'Assomption On the front gable and the clerestory area, as well as on top of the apse, regions too high to be reached by ladder, some sculptures are still to be seen. Inside, some late gothic capitals ‚Äì among which the \\"Rouffach smile\\" (sourire de Rouffach), the smiling heads of a young girl and a young boy facing each other ‚Äì still testify to the ornamental style employed by some of the church's designers. Rouffach's main church owns a pipe organ from the year 1855 (a work by Claude-Ignace Callinet) in which some of the pipes from the previous organ, of 1626, are still to be found. These are the oldest still-functioning organ pipes of Alsace.Orgue de Rouffach, Notre-Dame The rose window of the fa√ßade (14th century) is, by the number of lancets composing it (20) as well as by overall design, the most complex in Alsace, before the much larger one of Strasbourg Cathedral, which has only 16 lancets. Apart from the baptismal font, the tabernacle and the tombstone of the knight Werner Falk, all three in an ornate Gothic style, the rest of the interior furnishing is mainly Neo-Gothic.
