He was a prototypical British gentleman scientist and inventor of the Victorian era. Amongst many accomplishments, he developed the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, and later applied its principles to a novel form of illumination, the Bude light; developed a series of early steam-powered road vehicles; and laid claim—still discussed and disputed today—to the blastpipe, a key component in the success of steam locomotives, engines, and other coal-fired systems. Events surrounding the failure of his steam vehicle enterprise gave rise to controversy in his time, with considerable polarisation of opinion. His daughter Anna Jane Gurney (1816–1895) was devoted to him. During her lifetime, she engaged in an extraordinary campaign to ensure the blastpipe was seen as his invention. Biography Gurney was born in St Merryn, Cornwall, England on 14 February 1793. His unusual Christian name was his grandmother's surname but taken from his godmotherprobably Martha Caroline Goldsworthy who was a Maid of Honour to Queen Charlotte. Gurney's grandfather married into money, allowing his father, and to an extent himself, to live as gentlemen. He was schooled at the Grammar School at Truro, where he showed an interest in contemporary sciences; and had the opportunity through friends to meet Richard Trevithick and see his 'Puffing Devil', a full-size steam road carriage, at Camborne. After school he took a medical education with a Dr. Avery at Wadebridge, succeeding to the whole practice in 1813, and providing him with sufficient income to marry Elizabeth Symons, a farmer's daughter from Launcells, in 1814. The couple settled in Wadebridge where their daughter Anna Jane was born in January 1815. He practised as a surgeon, but he also became interested in chemistry and mechanical science; he was also an accomplished pianist, and constructed his own piano, described as a 'large instrument'. Lecture Hall of the Surrey Institution; Gurney was appointed lecturer here in 1822 He moved with his family to London in 1820, apparently discontented with rural life and wishing to seek his fortune. The family settled at 7 Argyle Street, near Hanover Square, where Gurney continued his practice as a surgeon. There he expanded his scientific knowledge and started giving a series of lectures on the elements of chemical science to the Surrey Institution, where he was appointed lecturer in 1822. A son, Goldsworthy John, was also born to the couple in that year, at Launcells (later to die relatively young in 1847). A skill attributed to Gurney was an ability to express scientific thought on paper and through lectures. His lectures in the 1822-3 period included one on the application of steam power to road vehicles. He was also of a practical bent, and in 1823 was awarded an Isis gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts for devising an oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. By 1825, he had started practical work on a steam carriage, taking space for a small workshop in Oxford Street and filing a first patent for \\"An apparatus for propelling carriages on common roads or railways – without the aid of horses, with sufficient speed for the carriage of passengers and goods\\". His work encompassed the development of the blastpipe, which used steam to increase the flow of air through a steam engine's chimney, so increasing the draw of air over the fire and, in short, much increasing the power-to-weight ratio of the steam engine. In 1826 he purchased From Jacob Perkins a manufacturing works at, and moved his family to living space in, 154 Albany Street, near Regent's Park, and proceeded to improve the designs of his carriages, described below. Whilst the carriages certainly had technical merit and much promise, he was unsuccessful in commercialising them; by the spring of 1832 he had run out of funding and was forced to auction his remaining business assets, eventually losing a great deal of his own and investors' money. The circumstances of the failure engendered controversy expressed in contemporary scientific publications, as well as in committees of the House of Commons. The Castle, Bude – slightly extended since Gurney's time In 1830, Gurney leased a plot of land overlooking Summerleaze Beach in Bude, from his friend Sir Thomas Acland, and set about the construction of a new house to be built amongst the sand hills. The construction rested on an innovative concrete raft foundation, representing an early worked example of this technique. The original house called \\"The Castle\\" still stands but has been extended over the past century. The Bude and Stratton Heritage Trust has been formed and plans are well advanced, under the Limelight Project, to raise funds to interpret the fascinating history and heritage of Bude and the surrounding area, within Bude Castle. In this period he became godfather to William Carew Hazlitt, who notes that Gurney was involved in property development in Fulham. Four Generations of a Literary Family by William Carew Hazlitt, G. Redway 1897, page 113 At The Castle, Gurney regrouped from his carriage failure, applying his mind to the principle of illumination by the forcing of oxygen into a flame to increase the brilliance of the flame, giving rise to the Bude Light. He also applied the principles of the blastpipe or steam jet to the ventilation of mines, as well as to the extinguishing of underground fires. Gurney's Castle His wife Elizabeth died in 1837, and is buried in St. Martin in the Fields. With his daughter – described as his constant companion – he moved to 'Reeds', a small house on the outskirts of Poughill, near Bude. In 1844 he bought a lease on Hornacott Manor, Boyton, from Bude, where he built Wodleigh Cottage for himself, and engaged his interest in farming. In 1850 he gave up the lease on The Castle. In this period, he became a consultant, applying his innovative techniques to a range of problems, notably, after 1852, to the ventilation of the new Houses of Parliament where in 1854 he was appointed 'Inspector of Ventilation'. He had previously successfully lit parliament and Trafalgar Square.Goldsworthy Gurney: Inventor took hot air out of Parliament (BBC, 22 January 2015) Replica bude-light in Trafalgar Square, with police station built into the base Perhaps arising out of the Boyton farming connection he took a second wife, being married at St. Giles in the Field to Jane Betty, the 24-year-old daughter of a farmer from Sheepwash, Devon; Gurney was 61. The marriage appears to have been unsuccessful; there was perhaps some contention between Anna Jane (39) and her much younger stepmother. Jane Betty was removed from Gurney's will, although they were never divorced. Gurney continued to divide his time between London and Cornwall, variously engaged in work with clients; experimenting and innovating in diverse fields such as heating (the Gurney Stove) or electrical conduction; and in improving his Hornacott estate. He was appointed president of the Launceston Agricultural Society. In 1863, Gurney was knighted by Queen Victoria, but later that year suffered a paralytic stroke; he sold Hornacott and retired back to Reeds in Cornwall, where he lived with his devoted Anna Jane, ultimately passing away on 28 February 1875. He is buried at Launcells parish church. Gurney's steam carriage The Goldsworthy Gurney steam carriage, in an 1827 illustration. Model of a Gurney steam carriage in The Castle, Bude. The Gurney steam drag, illustrated and described in a 1902 book by Moore as \\"His \\"Improved Steam Carriage\\" – an ordinary barouche drawn by an engine instead of horses.\\" In the period 1825–9, Gurney designed and built a number of steam-powered road vehicles which were intended to commercialise a steam road transport business—the Gurney Steam Carriage Company. His vehicles were built at his Regent's Park Manufactory works, and tested around the park's barrack yard, and on frequent excursions to Hampstead, Highgate, Edgware, Barnet and Stanmore, at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour (32 km/h). Gurney is by no means the only pioneering inventor in the history of steam road vehicles – Luke Herbert, in his 1837 Practical Treatise on Rail-Roads and Locomotive Engines, rebuts in scathing fashion claims made for Gurney in preference to Trevithick as inventor of the steam carriage: One of his vehicles was sufficiently robust to make a journey in July 1829, two months before the Rainhill Trials, from London to Bath and back, at an average speed for the return journey of 14 miles per hour—including time spend in refuelling and taking on water. His daughter Anna, in a letter to The Times newspaper in December 1875, notes that \\"I never heard of any accident or injury to anyone with it, except in the fray at Melksham, on the noted journey to Bath, when the fair people set upon it, burnt their fingers, threw stones, and wounded poor Martyn the stoker\\". The vehicle had to be escorted under guard to Bath to prevent further luddism. The steam carriage was not a commercial success. There was an understandable apprehension on the part of the public to a conveyance atop a dangerous steam boiler; seeking to overcome this objection, Gurney designed an articulated vehicle, termed the Gurney steam drag, in which a passenger carriage was tethered to and pulled by an engine. At least two of these were built and shipped to Glasgow around 1830. According to the Steam Club of Great Britain: The remains of one of this pair rests in Glasgow Museum of Transport, to which it was presented, having been found in a barn near the Paisley Road. Again, according to the Steam Club of Great Britain, it comprises: A regular service was established between Cheltenham and Gloucester by Sir Charles Dance, running four times daily, for a number of months and based on a fleet of three of Gurney's carriages; but the aspirations of Dance and Gurney were effectively dashed, according to Francis Maceroni in his 1836 book A Few Facts Concerning Elementary Locomotion A charge of £2 was levied on each steam carriage journey, whilst the toll for a horsedrawn carriage was 2 shillings. This may be contrasted with a contemporary exchequer loan to the railway developers of £100,000. Maceroni continues: At the same time, press coverage of an accident befalling a Glasgow steam drag adversely affected the reputation of the vehicles. Gurney was bankrupted with debts of £232,000. Sufficient was the concern about Gurney's bankruptcy, and sufficient were his contacts, that a House of Commons select committee was convened from 1831 to 1835 on Mr.Goldsworthy Gurney's Case. Its final report stated: Lyman Horace Weeks comments in his Automobile Biographies, that Other work Nineteenth century bellows-operated oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, including two different types of flashback arrestor A key development of his time at the Surrey Institute was use of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, normally credited to Robert Hare in which an intensely hot flame was created by burning a jet of oxygen and hydrogen together; the blowpipe was the underpinning of limelight; Gurney its first exponent. According to A History of The Growth of The Steam-Engine by Robert H. Thurston, Gurney was a proponent of the ammonia engine. \\"In 1822… Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney, who subsequently took an active part in their introduction, stated, in his lectures, that \\"elementary power is capable of being applied to propel carriages along common roads with great political advantage, and the floating knowledge of the day places the object within reach.\\" He made an ammonia engine—probably the first ever made—and worked it so successfully, that he made use of it in driving a little locomotive.\\" The steam-jet or blastpipe, which served to increase the draw of air through pipes, and which was applied to improve mine and sewerage ventilation, to increase the efficiency of steam-powered stationary engines and blast furnaces, and road or rail vehicles. After the Rainhill trials of 1829, there was considerable controversy as to the genesis of this invention since it became associated in the mind of the public with George Stephenson—probably through the agency of Samuel Smiles' biography of that man. In her 1875 letter to The Times, his daughter traces the path of the idea: Gurney communicated it to Timothy Hackworth, who employed it in his Royal George locomotive, from which Stephenson allegedly took his inspiration for its inclusion in the Rocket. More recent letters acquired by the National Railway Museum suggest that, in fact, Hackworth may have discovered the idea first and/or independently; and Herbert—clearly not a fan of Gurney—seeks to debunk claims for Gurney's invention by comparing the output of Gurney's carriages with those of Trevithick. Other problems faced by Gurney's claim to have invented this is the clear use of it by Trevithick as confirmed by contemporary notes and also the patent applied for it by another party in the early 19th century. He extended the use of the steam-jet to the cleaning of sewers, bridging his mechanical and medical knowledge in the service of the eradication of cholera in the metropolis; and in dealing with mine fires—notably bringing under control a fire known as the burning waste of Clackmannan, which in 1851 had raged for more than 30 years over an area of , at the South Sauchie Colliery near Alloa. Gurney injected some 8M cubic feet of chokedamp (a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide) into the mine by means of his steam-jet to extinguish the combustion; and after three weeks, drove water into the mine as a spray from the steam-jet to bring the temperature down from to . It is reckoned that the value of property saved by the extinguishing of this fire was £200,000. He further improved the problematical lighting of theatres which used limelight, with his invention of the Bude-Light. Using a standard flame producer such as an oil lamp and by adding oxygen directly into the flame he produced a dramatically increased bright white light. A system of prisms and lenses distributed Bude Light to every room of his Castle house. Bude lights were fitted in the House of Commons—where it is said that he replaced 280 candles with three such lamps, which lit the House for sixty years until the arrival of electricity—as well as along Pall Mall and in Trafalgar Square where recently refurbished replicas of the two styles originally used can be seen. He extended his work to lighthouse lamps, innovating in the choice of source, the use of lenses, and the introduction of identifying on-off patterns enabling seafarers to identify which lighthouse it was they saw flashing. A Gurney Stove, displayed at The Castle, Bude The Gurney Stove, another invention which he patented in 1856, was extensively used to heat a wide variety of buildings. The stove's most interesting feature is the use of external ribs to increase the surface area of the stove available for heat transfer. A number of these stoves are still in use to this day, in the cathedrals of Ely, Durham, Chester, Hereford and Peterborough. Arising from his successes with mine ventilation he was commissioned in 1852 to improve the gas lighting, heating, and especially the ventilation systems for the new Houses of Parliament at Westminster. Although he had some success in moving air around the palace buildings, ridding the legislature of the foul smell of the Thames was beyond his skill. Gurney worked on many other projects, with interests and patents extending from improved steam engine design, to electric telegraphy and the design of musical instruments. Anna Jane's hagiography Annotation by Anna Jane Gurney in Trams and Railway Locomotives, specifying that \\"It was the _blast_ produced by Gurney's \\"Steamjet\\" that enabled Stephenson to win the prize. The \\"Steamjet\\" had given high speed to Gurney's steam carriages on common roads. And this was its _first_ application to a railway carriage i.e. Locomotion.\\" Gurney's daughter Anna Jane appears to have engaged in considerable promotion of her father's claim to various of his inventions; the inscription on his gravestone reads: In her copy of the Dictionary of National Biography, all references to the blowpipe were amended by hand to his blowpipe.Bude's Forgotten Genius – Sir Goldsworthy Gurney.

Mason John Landis Mason (1832 in Vineland, New Jersey – February 26, 1902) was an American tinsmith and the patentee of the metal screw-on lid for antique fruit jars that have come to be known as Mason jars. Many such jars were printed with the line \\"Mason's Patent Nov 30th 1858\\". He also invented the first screw top salt shaker in 1858. Inventing career In 1858, Mason invented a square-shouldered jar with threaded screw-top, matching lid, and rubber ring for an airtight seal – the Mason jar. Until the 1830s, long before refrigeration and hothouse gardens, many fruits and vegetables had been available only seasonally, but the recent development of jars had made canning a practical alternative to drying, pickling, or smoking to preserve food. Prior to Mason's innovation, jars had a flat, un-threaded top, across which a tin flat lid was laid and sealed with wax. It was messy, unreliable, and unsafe – if the wax was not applied properly it allowed bacteria to thrive in the jar. Mason's easy and re-usable jars made home canning procedures popular among American settlers, homesteaders, and even in urban homes, but most Mason jars were manufactured by competitors after his patent expired in 1879. Personal life He was married and had six daughters. He died in poverty in a tenement house in New York City in 1902. Patents United States patent 22,186, dated November 30, 1858, is primarily on the use of exterior threads in the jar and a corresponding metal cap.

After the Empire's dissolution in 1806, the Wettin Electors raised Saxony to a territorially reduced kingdom.  Formation and Ascanian rule After the dissolution of the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the name Saxony was first applied to a small territory midway along the river Elbe, around the city of Wittenberg, which had formerly belonged to the March of Lusatia. Around 1157 it was held by Albert the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg. When Emperor Frederick Barbarossa deposed the Saxon duke, Henry the Lion in 1180, the Wittenberg lands belonged to Albert's youngest son, Count Bernhard of Anhalt, who assumed the Saxon ducal title. Bernard's eldest son, Albert I, ceded the territory known as Anhalt to his younger brother, Henry, retaining the ducal title and attached to this territory the lordship of Lauenburg. His sons divided the territory into the duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe- Lauenburg. Both lines claimed the Saxon electoral dignity or privilege, which led to confusion during the 1314 election of the Wittelsbach duke, Louis of Bavaria as King of the Romans against his Habsburg rival, Duke Frederick the Fair of Austria, as both candidates received one vote each from each of the two rival Ascanian branches. A page from the Golden Bull of 1356 of King Wenceslas, National Library of Austria Louis was succeeded by the Luxembourg king, Charles of Bohemia. After his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in 1355, Charles issued the Golden Bull of 1356, the fundamental law of the Empire settling the method of electing the German King by seven Prince-electors. The rival Wittelsbach and Habsburg dynasties got nothing, instead the Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, Archmarshal of the Empire, received the right to elect the King of the Romans and the prospective Emperor, together with six other elector Princes of the Empire. Thus, the country, though small in area, gained influence far beyond its extent. The electoral privilege also contained the obligation of male primogeniture. That is, only the eldest son could succeed as ruler. It therefore forbade the division of the territory among several heirs, in order to prevent the disintegration of the country. The importance of this stipulation is shown by the history of most of the fragmented German principalities (e.g. the Saxon Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg) which were not constituted as electorates. Wettin rule Saxony partitioned according to the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig: The Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct with the death of Elector Albert III in 1422, after which Emperor Sigismund granted the country and electoral privilege upon Margrave Frederick IV of Meissen, who had been a loyal supporter in the Hussite Wars. The late Albert's Ascanian relative, Duke Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg protested in vain. Frederick, one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the House of Wettin, which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent Margravate of Meissen up the Elbe river - established under Emperor Otto I in 965 - and also over the Landgravate of Thuringia since 1242. Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margravate of Meissen and Thuringia were united under one ruler, and as a unified territory gradually became known as, Upper Saxony.Cordula Bornefeld, \\"Die Herzöge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\\", in: Die Fürsten des Landes: Herzöge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft für Schleswig- Holsteinische Geschichte, Neumünster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389. When Elector Frederick II died in 1464, his two surviving sons overrode the primogeniture principle and divided his territories by the Treaty of Leipzig on 26 August 1485. This resulted in the already separated Wettin dynasty becoming the Ernestine and Albertine branches. The elder Ernest, founder of the Ernestine line, received large parts of the former Duchy of Saxe- Wittenberg with the electoral privilege attached to it, and the southern Landgravate of Thuringia. While the younger Albert, founder of the Albertine line, received northern Thuringia and the lands of the former Margravate of Meissen. Thus, although the Ernestine line had initially had greater authority until the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, the electoral privilege and territory then fell to the Albertine line, which later also became a royal house when Saxony was proclaimed a kingdom in the 19th century. This partition was to decisively enfeeble the Wettin dynasty in relation to the then rising House of Hohenzollern. It had already achieved its own electoral privilege as Margraves of Brandenburg since 1415.  Protestant Reformation  Castle church in Wittenberg, where Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses Frederick III, Elector of Saxony protected Luther from the manhunt The Protestant movement of the 16th century largely spread under the protection of the Saxon rulers. Ernest's son, Elector Frederick the Wise established in 1502 the University at Wittenberg, where the Augustinian monk, Martin Luther, was appointed professor of philosophy in 1508. At the same time he became one of the preachers at the castle church in Wittenberg. On 31 October 1517, he enclosed in a protest letter to Albert of Brandenburg the Archbishop of Mainz, The Ninety-five Theses against the sale of indulgences and other Catholic practices, an action that marked the start of what came to be called the Reformation. Although the Elector did not at first share the new attitude, he granted his protection to Luther anyway. Owing to this intervention, Pope Leo X decided against summoning Luther to Rome in 1518, and the Elector secured for Luther Imperial safe-conduct to the Diet of Worms in 1521. When Luther was declared banned in the entire empire by Emperor Charles V, the Elector had him brought to live in Wartburg Castle on his Thuringian estate. Lutheran doctrines spread first in Ernestine Saxony. In 1525, Frederick died, possibly never having officially left the Catholic Church, unless on his deathbed in 1525, but he was sympathetic towards Lutheranism by the time of his death.Bacon, Paul M. “Art Patronage and Piety in Electoral Saxony: Frederick the Wise Promotes the Veneration of His Patron, St. Bartholomew.” The Sixteenth Century Journal, vol. 39, no. 4, 2008, pp. 973–1001. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20479134. He was succeeded by his brother, John the Constant. John was already a zealous Lutheran. He exercised full authority over the new church introduced as, the \\"Lutheran Confession\\", and ordered the dismissal of all priests who continued in the Catholic faith. He directed the use of the Vernacular Liturgy drawn up by Luther. In 1531 he formed the Schmalkaldic League with a number of other ruling princes for the continuation of the Protestant doctrine and for a joint defence against the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, a fierce opponent of the Reformation. John was followed in 1532 by his son, John Frederick the Magnanimous (died 1554), who was also one of the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League. In 1542, he seized the Diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz, and confiscated the secular possessions of the Dioceses of Meissen and Hildesheim. Lutheranism, as it came to be organised in Saxony, would serve as an example for future Protestant states throughout Europe.Elizabeth Plummer. \\"Martin Luther and the Saxon Electors\\" in Oxford Research Encyclopedias. Subscription necessary for full text. [retrieved 2018.11.27.] The Electorate of Saxony was, however, not the first state to establish Lutheranism as the state religion. Other states, like the Duchy of Prussia (1525) and the Landgraviate of Hesse (1526), preceded the official establishment of it in Saxony (1527). Schmalkaldic War Saxony after the 1547 Capitulation of Wittenberg: Saxony after the Treaty of Naumburg (1554) Prince Elector Maurice of Saxony, the \\"arch manipulator\\" by Lucas Cranach the Younger Sophie of Brandenburg, the only woman to act as \\"Elector\\" (1591-1601), as Regent for her son, Christian II Meanwhile, in the Albertine lands Duke Albert's son, George (1500–39), founder of the Catholic League of Dessau, was a strong opponent of the Lutheran doctrine and had repeatedly sought to influence his Ernestine cousins in favour of the Catholic Church. However, George's brother and successor, Duke Henry IV of Saxony (1539–41), was finally won over to Protestantism under the influence of his wife, Catherine of Mecklenburg, and thus the Catholic diocese of Meissen came to be abolished. Henry's son and successor, Duke Maurice, was one of the most controversial figures of the Reformation period. Although a zealous Protestant, ambition and desire to increase his wealth led him to join the Emperor against the Schmalkaldic League, established by his Ernestine cousin, John Frederick. After the outbreak of the Schmalkaldic War Elector John Frederick was placed under an Imperial ban and was finally defeated and captured by Emperor Charles V at the Battle of Mühlberg on 24 April 1547. The Capitulation of Wittenberg of May 19 obliged him to cede former Saxe-Wittenberg with its electoral privilege to his Albertine cousin, Duke Maurice, who had switched sides as fortunes reversed. After the Capitulation, the Ernestine branch of the Wettin family only retained its possessions in Thuringia, that owing to repeated divisions among the heirs from 1572 onwards, was soon cut up into the minor Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach et al. Those still in existence at the time of the 1918 German Revolution after World War I were the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and the duchies of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg. After the Wittenberg Capitulation the Saxon Electorate consisted of former Saxe-Wittenberg and Meissen now united, and remained under the authority of the Albertine line of the Wettin family. Maurice again became estranged from Charles V partly out of resentment for not receiving what was left of the Ernestine possessions, but even more on account of his motivation to see a Protestant at the head of the empire. After the Emperor had issued the Augsburg Interim, Maurice concluded an alliance with King Henry II of France and through the Treaty of Chambord 1552 ceded the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun in Lorraine to France. Maurice secretly took part in all the princely conspiracies against the Emperor, who only escaped capture by fleeing. During the same year, Charles V was obliged by the Peace of Passau to grant freedom of religion to the Protestant states. Maurice died in 1553 at the age of 32. His brother and successor, Elector Augustus, seized the Catholic dioceses of Merseburg and Naumburg-Zeitz for himself. The last Bishop of Merseburg, Michael Helding called Sidonius, died at Vienna in 1561. The Emperor demanded the election of a new bishop, but Augustus forced the election of his son Alexander, who was eight years old, as administrator. After Alexander had died in 1565, he administered the diocese himself. Similarly, after the death in 1564 of Julius von Pflug, the last Catholic Bishop of Naumburg, the Elector confiscated the bishopric and forbade adherence to the Catholic religion. Those cathedral canons who were still Catholic were only permitted to practice their religion for ten more years. In 1581, John of Haugwitz, the last Bishop of Meissen, resigned his office. In 1587 he became a Protestant. The episcopal domains fell likewise to Saxony, and the cathedral chapter ceased to exist. During the reigns of the Elector Augustus (1553–86) and Christian (1586–91), a movement called Crypto-Calvinism gained strength in the electorate. As Christian II (1591–1611) was too young to rule, his mother, Sophie of Brandenburg became regent in 1591 and was the only woman to act as \\"Elector\\". She was vehemently opposed to the \\"new\\" movement. Just as her young son was assuming the reins of power in 1601, the Saxon chancellor, Nikolaus Krell, who had been spreading the other Protestant doctrine, was overthrown and beheaded in 1601.https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065438/http://www.neumarkt- dresden.de/nikolaus-krell.html (in German) A more strict adherence to Lutheranism was reintroduced and with it a religious oath.  Thirty Years' War  Saxony in 1618, at the war's outbreak. Saxony (pink) in 1648, with Lusatian acquisitions The Thirty Years' War (1618–48) occurred during the reign of Elector John George (1611–56). In this struggle, the Elector was at first neutral, and for a long time he would not listen to the overtures of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Not until the Imperial General Johann Tserclaes of Tilly advanced into Saxony did the Elector join the forces of the Swedish Empire. However, after the 1634 Battle of Nördlingen, the Elector concluded the Peace of Prague with Emperor Ferdinand II in 1635. By this treaty, Saxony received the Margravates of Upper and Lower Lusatia as a Bohemian fiefdom, and the condition of the Church lands that had been secularized was not altered. The Swedes, for their part, took revenge with ten years of plunder. By the 1648 Peace of Westphalia Saxony retained its Lusatian possessions as an Imperial fiefdom. However, it lost forever the possibility of extending its territory along the lower course of the Elbe into the lands of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, even though they were under the administration of the Wettin Duke, Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels. Upon his death in 1680, the secularised Duchy of Magdeburg fell to the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg, which confirmed the primacy of Brandenburg- Prussia under the Protestant Hohenzollern dynasty. In 1653, the Saxon elector became the head of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the union of the Protestant Imperial Estates. Under the following Electors, religious questions were not as prominent. A rigid Lutheranism remained the prevailing faith, and the practice of any other faith was strictly prohibited. About the middle of the 17th century, Italian merchants were the first Catholics to reappear in the country. They settled in Dresden, the capital, and in Leipzig, the most important commercial city. The practice of Roman Catholicism was, however, not permitted to them. Coat of arms of Augustus the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony Saxony-Commonwealth of Poland- Lithuania Augustus II the Strong oil by Baciarelli On 1 June 1697, Elector Frederick Augustus I, \\"the Strong\\" (1694–1733) converted to Catholicism and was subsequently elected King of Poland and Grand duke of Lithuania. This marked a personal union between Saxony and the Commonwealth of Two Nations that lasted almost 70 years with interruptions (see Stanislaw Leszczynski). Meanwhile, in Saxony the formation of a Catholic parish and private observance of the Catholic faith was permitted at least in Dresden. The conversion of the Elector raised fears among many Lutherans that Catholicism would now be re- established in Saxony. In response, the Elector transferred his authority over Lutheran institutions (which, until then, had been exercised by the sovereign) to a government board, the Privy Council. The Privy Council was composed exclusively of Protestants. Even after his conversion, the Elector remained the head of the Protestant body in the Reichstag, despite an unsuccessful attempt by Brandenburg-Prussia and Hanover to take over the position in 1717–1720. August III of Poland as Crown Prince His son, Elector Frederick Augustus II (1733–63), was received into the Catholic Church, while still heir-apparent, on 28 November 1712, in Bologna, Italy. With this conversion, which on account of the excitable sentiment of the Lutheran population, had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling family of Saxony once more became Catholic. He too was controversially \\"elected King of Poland and Grand duke of Lithuania\\", that is monarch of the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania against the French candidate, Louis François, Prince of Conti, who, on learning the result, attempted to claim the throne arriving by sea at the port of Gdańsk. His attempt was repulsed.Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/526055/Saxony Frederick Augustus reigned as Augustus III of Poland 1734–1763.Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43134/Augustus-III Saxony's partial return to Rome Before this, individual members of the Albertine line had returned to the Roman Church, but they had died without issue, as did the last rulers of Saxe-Merseburg (in 1738) and Saxe-Weissenfels who died out in 1746. Another collateral line founded in 1657 was that of Saxe-Zeitz, which became extinct in 1759. Members of this line who became Catholic were Christian Augustus (died 1725), Cardinal Archbishop of Gran in Esztergom, Hungary and Maurice Adolphus, Bishop of Leitmeritz in Bohemia (died 1759). The most zealous promoter of the Catholic faith in Saxony was the Austrian Archduchess Maria Josepha, daughter of Emperor Joseph I, who in 1719 married Frederick Augustus, later the second elector of that name. The Court Church of Dresden was built 1739–51 by the Italian architect Chiaveri in the Roman Baroque style. It was heavily damaged during the bombing of Dresden and subsequently rebuilt. Notwithstanding the faith of its rulers, Saxony remained an entirely Protestant country. The few Catholics who settled there remained without any political or civil rights. Fighting for survival Frederick Augustus III, last Elector of Saxony and first King of the Kingdom of Saxony In 1756, during the Third Silesian War between Prussia and Austria (part of the Seven Years' War), Saxony was invaded and overrun by the forces of King Frederick II of Prussia, who took Dresden and after the Siege of Pirna forced the Saxon army to surrender and join his Prussian Army. Many later deserted, and a force of Saxon troops fought to restore their independence. The Treaty of Hubertusburg in 1763 eventually restored Saxony as an entity. When in 1806 Napoleon began a war with Prussia, Saxony at first allied itself with his long-time rival, but afterwards joined Napoleon and entered the Confederation of the Rhine. Elector Frederick Augustus III (1763–1827) was formally the last Elector of Saxony. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, he clung to office and became the first monarch of the short-lived Kingdom of Saxony, under the title of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony.  Subdivisions  The Electorate of Saxony was divided into several districts or (literally \\"circles\\", singular ) in the late 15th and renamed in the 19th centuries. These were: * Electoral Circle, which (roughly) corresponded to the former Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, renamed the Wittenberg Circle in 1807 * , named for the Ore mountains , named for Neustadt an der Orla * in northern Thuringia around Weissenfels * in the Vogtland region Additionally, there were several territories which were not part of , such as the Margravate of Lusatia.

Users could access content, third-party data, and other services from a hotspot or download station. The service had demos of upcoming and currently available games and may have location-specific content. When the service debuted, users could also connect to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop. The Nintendo Zone Viewer application allowed the Nintendo DSi and 3DS to detect and use the Nintendo Zone service. This application has been discontinued worldwide, but all other Nintendo Zone functionality remains.  History  In collaboration with the restaurant chain McDonald's, the service originated in the Kantō, Chūkyō and Kansai regions of Japan. Over 1,000 DS Download Stations in Japan were planned to be converted into Nintendo Zones to enable SpotPass communications. Nintendo Zone content was available at over 29,000 locations in the United States. The service launched in Europe on April 25, 2012 with approximately 25,000 locations. Nintendo announced in July 2013 that the service would receive StreetPass enhancements. The StreetPass Relay Points system was introduced as part of an firmware update to Nintendo 3DS consoles in August 2013. When a 3DS owner visited a Nintendo Zone location, his or her StreetPass data would have been stored there then transferred when another owner visited with the same games. The viewer would always remain on even if it is out range of a Nintendo Zone. On December 8, 2011, a 3DS update began that allowed users to access new Nintendo Zones through a variety of new hotspots. A press release showed that Boingo Wireless teamed up with Nintendo of America to allow users automatic access to the zone within 42 Boingo- serviced airports within North America. This has offered a new range of encounters and features without any additional cost. In December 2013, a new feature was added on in celebration of National StreetPass Weekend. This feature combined and mixed together all Nintendo Zones within North America into one and allowed users who come across a Nintendo Zone to streetpass and exchange data with other 3DS users from all around the continent, as opposed to only those 3DS users who have passed by that specific zone. Through this feature, users were able to StreetPass a maximum of 6 users at a time from other parts of North America. This feature helped raise awareness about Nintendo Zone and what it could offer to 3DS users. It encouraged 3DS users to access a nearby zone in order to meet users from other parts of the continent and to gather more StreetPass relay points. Through this feature, many users were able to exchange information and gameplay items with other users. It also encouraged interaction between 3DS users who own the same game to initiate item exchanges that each users would be able to take away with them once the events are over. Locations Nintendo 3DS users were able to access the Nintendo Zone inside these following places: Best Buy, Home Depot, and CrossIron Mills in Canada; and AT&T; Retail Store, and McDonald's in the USA. Users could find nearby Nintendo Zones by searching for their city or postal code on the Nintendo website.  DS Download Station  View inside a DS Download Station The DS Download Station was an in-store demo service launched by Nintendo in early 2006. As the name states, these are stations that can be used to download game demos and trailers to a Nintendo DS. The download station consisted of a standard retail DS hidden inside a sealed box with a special DS Download Station cartridge inserted in it. The cartridge acts as a server for customers to download new game demos or videos. When Nintendo released a new demo cartridge to retailers, they simply load the cartridge into the DS locked in the sealed box. A DS Download Station could distribute only one game at a time, but can send the demos to up to fifteen DS systems simultaneously. The games can be downloaded by navigating to DS Download Play on the Nintendo DS's main menu and browsing for a DS Download Station in range. Players could choose from a wide range of games that refreshed every quarter of the year. The first game demos released were Tetris DS, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, Mario Kart DS and more. From there it would load a simple menu & loader application to facilitate loading the demo of the player's choice. The demos remain on the DS until the power is turned off. The US and European version of the DS Download Station are completely different from the Japanese version. The Japanese version uses 3 PCs, each connected to an Internet connection. The difference in design was due to most retail locations in the US at the time not having an available Internet connection, and therefore, a self-contained solution was necessary. There had been nineteen different volumes of DS Download Station, with each volume differing in content between North America, Europe, and Japan. The DS Download Station had long since been discontinued, with all the Display DS units being resold in the normal retail market.

The trains were introduced on February 2, 2006 to coincide with the extension of the Port Island Line to the newly opened Kobe Airport. The series is a successor to the 8000 series trains that has run on Port Liner since the line's opening in 1981. Background Introduced on February 2, 2006, simultaneously with the extension of the Port Liner to Kobe Airport, the 2000 series is based on the Kawasaki Computer Control Vehicle (KCV) developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the same company that manufactures the 8000 series rolling stock used for the Port Liner since service began. Therefore, it has guide wheels for floating switches installed on both sides of the cars. 2000 series and 8000 series are the only New Transit System rolling stock to handle this type. Since the last of the ageing 8000 series trains were withdrawn in 2009, additional 2000 series rolling stock may be manufactured in the future. Formation numbers are 13 through 15. Physical design The exterior of the 2000 series is different from the 8000 series with the unpainted stainless steel body wrapped by lines in the corporate colors, green and blue. The logo mark next to the doors on the 8000 series is not present. The carriage has been changed to the same core-type pneumatic rubber tires used on the 1000 series. The interior is also different from the 8000 series with warm-colored box seats in a 2+1 arrangement. It is also equipped with overhead baggage racks and blinds. As in the 8000 series there is piping on the ceiling above the entry/exit doors to substitute for hand straps, but its shape is different. The communications device has been changed to intercom-form. Barrier-free (accessibility) conversion Manufactured in accordance with the Transportation Accessibility Law, the 2000 series has from its beginning had wheelchair spaces and over-door LED information displays to indicate on which side the doors will open with multi-lingual support. 8000 series rolling stock was remodeled to include these features also. The intercom and emergency stop button were also moved close to the wheelchair space and their height adjusted to be usable from a wheelchair. Car body interior space was enlarged (by removing the baggage areas found in the 8000 series), and the elevation difference between platform and entry/exit doors reduced.

It is run by the Vancouver Pride Society (VPS), a not-for-profit, volunteer-run organization that seeks to \\"produce inclusive, celebratory events, and advocacy for LGBTQAI2S+\\". Vancouver's Pride Parade is the largest parade of any kind in Western Canada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia and the BC Provincial Health Officer order restricting mass gatherings to 50 people or less, 2020 Pride in-person events were moved online. The Vancouver Pride Society has dubbed the festival #vanvirtualpride 2020 and it culminates on August 2 with a virtual parade. A public art exhibition was also held with pieces from local two-spirit, trans and queer artists displayed around the city. History Vancouver's earliest Pride celebrations began when the Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE) organized a picnic and art exhibit in Ceperley Park. The August 1973 edition of GATE's newspaper, Gay Tide, features coverage of \\"Gay Pride Week '73.\\", and was followed shortly thereafter by the first Pride parade in 1978. In 2011 some activists claimed that the actual Pride parade did not start until 1981. The parade, which covered only one side of the street while the other remained open to traffic, ran from Nelson Park to Alexandra Park via Thurlow, Pacific and Beach. One of the notable founders of the Pride Parade, Barb Snelgrove was inducted into the Vancouver Queer Hall of Fame in 2013. The three-year theme for the 2009–2011 Pride Parade and Festival was Educate, Liberate, Celebrate. 2014 Vancouver Pride Parade Leadership and organization The Pride Parade and Festival is run by the Vancouver Pride Society (VPS), a not-for-profit, volunteer-run organization. The mission of the VPS is that it \\"strives to produce events that reflect the pride the LGBTQAI2S+ community has in itself, by strengthening the sense of community, and contributing to the vibrancy, health and overall well-being of all persons in the community.\\" The VPS is managed by a 9-member volunteer board of directors and a handful of paid staff, who handle the finances, logistics and operations of the organization and events. In addition, many hundreds of volunteers are involved in running the events. The events are funded through annual donations, corporate sponsorships, the City of Vancouver, parade entry fees, festival vendor fees, and donations collected during events. Parade The annual Pride parade is the largest parade in Western Canada, and one of the largest in North America. Starting at 12 noon on the day of the Pride Festival, at Robson Street and Thurlow Street, the parade heads west down Robson to Denman Street, follows Denman to Pacific and Beach Avenues and finishes at the Sunset Beach Festival site. The parade has a contingent of approximately 150 entries, including cars, floats and marching units. Among the regulars are the Vancouver Police and Fire Departments, Dykes on Bikes, PFLAG, Little Sister's Bookstore, and many of the bars and clubs from the Davie Village. A regular feature of each parade is an institution of parade marshals. Often it is a person representing a country where similar events are banned and gay people are still persecuted. The grand marshal in 2010 was Nikolai Alekseev from Moscow, Russia. In 2013, the Pride Parade was granted official civic status by the City of Vancouver.Vancouver Pride parade gets civic status, Daily Xtra, May 29, 2013 On Tuesday July 21, 2020 the VPS informed the BC Liberals that they were not permitted to take part in the virtual parade due to inaction on Chilliwack-Kent MLA Laurie Throness, who has been accused of homophobic and transphobic comments and views. Festival and events The Sunset Beach Festival takes place on the Sunday of the August long weekend, concurrently with the Pride parade. Located at Sunset Beach at the end of the parade route, the festival includes a diverse collection of vendors, entertainment, family activities and beer gardens. In addition to the Pride Parade and Festival, the VPS organizes a number of events throughout the summer, including East Side Pride, held on the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Gay Day @ Playland, Movie Night, Picnic in the Park, in Stanley Park, Davie Street Pride Party, a large street party in the heart of the Davie Village, the Terry Wallace Memorial Breakfast and Pride Youth Dance in the evening after the parade and festival.

The killing, and the events as a result of it, have generated heavy criticism of the former government, particularly the interior minister, and the extent to which then President Mikheil Saakashvili has truly introduced judicial independence and a democratic culture into society. The murder Sandro Girgvliani was found dead on January 28, 2006 on the outskirts of Tbilisi with multiple injuries inflicted as a result of physical abuse. According to an Imedi Television investigation on February 12, the murder of the 28-year-old head of the United Georgian Bank's Foreign Department, can be traced to a series of events which developed in Tbilisi's elite Sharden Bar. It is alleged that the Inspector General of Ministry of Internal Affairs, Vasil Sanodze was holding his birthday party to which the highest members of the department were invited. Tako Salakaia, the wife of the then-Interior Minister and subsequent Prime Minister, Vano Merabishvili, was in attendance, and by chance happened to be a friend of Girgvliani's girlfriend, Tamar Maisuradze. Maisuradze's presence is reportedly the reason for the subsequent victim's fatal visit. Levan Bukhaidze, Girgvliani's friend, who had accompanied his friend to the bar, claims that a few minutes before the kidnapping took place, the victim had an argument with his girlfriend, who was sitting with the Interior Minister's wife and her companions at the birthday party. In court Maisuradze recalled her dialogue with Girgvliani in the bar, claiming that \\"He asked why I was sitting with strangers. To this question I answered: that it did not matter who I was with and I asked whether he had come to find out only this. I did not know these people, but they were acquaintances of the girl I had come with. Then he asked why I was sitting with that ‘faggot’ – referring to [Guram] Donadze (head of the Ministry Press Centre).\\" Whilst Bukhaidze has denied this comment was made, it is clear that Sandro Girgvliani and his friend left the scene, and were reportedly stuffed into a silver Mercedes-Benz ML Class vehicle by unknown men shortly afterwards. They were then taken to Okrokana, on the outskirts of Tbilisi. Girgvliani’s friend claims that whilst he was able to escape, Girgvliani was murdered. His body was found close to a nearby cemetery the next morning. Aftermath At a news conference on February 21, Sandro Girgvliani's mother said that officials from the Interior Ministry “masterminded my son's murder.” She demanded an immediate interrogation of those officials from the Interior Ministry who were present at the cafe with Girgvliani. At a subsequent conference on February 22, Member of Parliament (MP) Koba Davitashvili, leader of the Georgian Conservative Party and MP Koka Guntsadze of the Rightist Opposition opposition party, demanded that the authorities immediately investigate the case. They also alleged that Oleg Melnikov, an employee of the Interior Ministry, was among those persons who kidnapped Girgvliani and his friend. Guram Donadze, told InterPressNews agency on February 21 that he and other officials had already been interrogated. \\"I will not make further comments while the investigation is on-going\\", Donadze said, but denied the allegations as 'groundless'. The Minister Vano Merabishvili meanwhile made his first public statement about the case on February 25 and hinted that he was not yet going to sack any of these officials. On the 28th, MP for the Conservative Party Zviad Dzidziguri convened a press conference and showed an interview with Girgvliani's friend Bukhaidze – an eyewitness. The interview was conducted by MP Dzidziguri himself and, during the footage, Dzidziguri shows Bukhaidze a picture of a young man and asks Bukhaidze to identify this man. Bukhaidze replies that the man in the picture 'looks very much like' one of the four people who beat the two friends after they were abducted. The man in the picture was an Interior Ministry staff-member, Oleg Melnikov. Bukhaidze said he was \\"not 100% sure, but I can say that he looks very much like [the man]\\" Dzidziguri stressed that \\"The most important thing with this fact is that the investigators have not shown this picture to Levan Bukhaidze – which further increases doubts about the investigation process\\". During parliamentary hearings on February 28, Merabishvili said that the investigation has not yet revealed any facts which could cause the dismissal of those officials who were mentioned in the Imedi report. He also said that allegations to link officials to the case are \\"attempts to discredit the police.... There are attempts to link this [case] to my family members as well. This is done deliberately to get on my nerves.\\" Whilst the Minister was in the midst of a speech at the hearing, opposition parliamentarians from the Rightist Opposition, Republican, Conservative and Democratic Front factions walked out of the chamber to protest against Merabishvili, and the possibly partisan investigation. Parliamentarians from the ruling National Movement party, however thanked the Merabishvili for the performance of his department, with MP Givi Targamadze saying that \\"The opposition’s walk-out was just a stage show. They are speculating over the Girgvliani murder case and they are trying to use it for their own political interests, which is absolutely inadmissible\\". After the hearings, the opposition parliamentarians called for Merabishvili's resignation. Davit Gamkrelidze claimed that \\"It has become clear today that Merabishvili is trying to cover-up criminals sitting in the Interior Ministry. We, the opposition, society, should launch activities directed towards [ensuring the] dismissal of Merabishvili,\\" Scandal widens On March 5, events began to gather pace as Imedi television broadcast another report questioning the official version of the death of a former anti-drug policeman, Gia Telia. The programme indicated that some officials from the Interior Ministry could have been involved in the killing of Mr Telia. The former policeman, who retired in 2003, was killed in a clash with the Interior Ministry's Special Operations Department (SOD) on February 16, 2006. According to the Ministry, Telia, a suspected drug dealer, was killed by police after he opened fire. The Ministry's press office distributed a video of the operation to the national television networks showing the body of Telia lying on the floor of his apartment holding a pistol in his right hand. However, in an interview with Imedi television, relatives of Telia claim that he would not hold a gun in his right hand as he was left-handed. Additionally they claimed that Telia had alleged that certain officials from the Ministry wanted 'to get rid of him' because of information he possessed about their possible involvement in drug trafficking. In a 2005 interview the former police officer claimed the police had unsuccessfully tried to arrest him under fabricated charges. He was then attacked and injured by a gunshot. In the interview Telia did not name the officials from the Interior Ministry who were apparently interested in his elimination, but speculated that Irakli Kodua, Chief of the Interior Ministry's Special Operations Department (SOD), 'was ordered' to organize his assassination. At the same time several opposition groupings, including the Rightist Opposition and Georgian Labour Party, announced their intention to launch street protests against the government in an attempt to force Vano Merabishvili to resign. Arrests On March 6 Vano Merabishvili announced that four officers - Gia Alania, Avtandil Aptsiauri, Aleksandre Gachava and Mikheil Bibiluri - from the Interior Ministry had been arrested on suspicion of killing Sandro Girgvliani. The minister gave no motive for the crime but stated that he had \\"evidence proving that they have committed this crime\\". The names of the four men had not been mentioned in the report, aired by Imedi television on February 12. Shortly after the arrests were announced MPs from the New Rights and Democratic Front parliamentary faction's convened a news conference. They said that the arrest of the Interior officials was \\"a good precedent\\". However Koba Davitashvili of the Democratic Front added that \\"the major part of the investigation is still ahead. Not only should those who committed the crime be held responsible, but also those who ordered it.\\" The parliamentarians again called for Merabishvili's resignation. Dismissal and widening criticism On March 7 Guram Donadze one of the men at the centre of the murder was unexpectedly fired. The official reason behind Donadze's dismissal was due to 'conflicting relations' with a number of journalists. MPs from the Rightist Opposition and Democratic Front then demanded that the Interior Minister, Vano Merabishvili, sack the Chief of the Department of Constitutional Security, Data Akhalaia and arrest Akhalaia's deputy Oleg Melnikov for his alleged active participation in the beating of Girgvliani. The ruling National Movement, responded by announcing their 'clear-cut support' towards Merabishvili and branded the opposition as 'closely incorporated into the criminal world'. At this point the influential former Foreign Minister and leader of the Georgia's Way political party, Salome Zourabichvili, announced her intention to work with the opposition parties regarding Girgvliani's murder. Speaking to Civil Georgia she said \\"... spare no efforts over this issue – be it street rallies, media statements, etc. Because, if a syndrome of fear appears, if the guilty are not punished... if there is no court, then we move towards a totalitarian regime.\\" Flaws in witness statements Levan Bukhaidze, a key witness and the friend of Sandro Girgvliani, on March 9 revealed that he had failed on the same day to identify Oleg Melnikov, amongst four people during a police lineup. However he later told Imedi television that this did not mean that the official was not amongst the men who brutally beat him and his friend on January 27. Bukhaidze went on to question the testimony of Gia Alana, one of the detained suspects, who claimed that he met with Girgvliani while the latter was coming out of the Sheredan café on the 27th. Alania says that he and his accompanying colleagues overheard Girgvliani verbally insult Donadze, irritating Alania and triggered a dispute between himself and the victim. Bukhaidze strongly denied this and claimed that no dispute had taken place after he and his friend left the café. Despite Bukhaidze's failure to identify Oleg Melnikov, a statement made by Girgvliani's girlfriend, Tamar Maisuradze, hinted at Melnikov's possible involvement. She claimed that Melnikov left the café, under the pretext to buy a cigarette, immediately after Bukhaidze and Girgvliani went out. He allegedly returned only after around 40 minutes, with Maisuradze going on to say that this was explained by the fact that he had travelled to a distant supermarket after being unable to buy the cigarettes he wanted at a nearby shop. \\"I have watched security video of that very same supermarket but I have not seen Melnikov entering [it]\\", she added. Condemnation and resignation In a statement issued on March 13 the Georgian Ombudsman Sozar Subari said that investigation of Sandro Girgvliani murder case was \\"a serious test for the government\\". He said that so far the only answer he had received from the authorities regarding the investigation of the case was that \\"there are punitive teams within the Interior Ministry, which are above of laws and which can liquidate any person in case of will.\\" Sozar Subari's statement also said that the arrest of the four officers, \\"failed to remove doubts\\" persisting in the society regarding the murder case. \\"Those officials, who are suspected by society of having links with this case, would have been resigned in any democratic state, or in a state which has an ambition to be a democratic\\". Shortly afterwards Data Akhalaia, and Oleg Melnikov announced their temporary resignation from office pending an investigation. Mr Akhalaia told a news conference that \\"We have nothing to do with the crime committed on January 28 [murder of Sandro Girgvliani], neither direct, nor indirect. It might be a surprise for certain [persons], but solving of this [criminal] case was made possible as a result of our efforts. Despite this, as we feel morally responsibility towards the society, our government and our families, we have decided to appeal the Interior Minister [Vano Merabishvili] to suspend our duties\\" Opposition parliamentarians, said that Akhalaia and Sanodze's decision was welcome and a result of pressure exerted by society on the Interior Ministry. MP Koba Davitashvili, leader of opposition Conservative Party, told reporters \\"We can only welcome this decision, which will definitely defuse political tensions… But now it is very important to follow investigation of this case, so that to make sure that all those who masterminded this [murder case], if there are any, are prosecuted,\\" Protests On March 16, the most significant protests towards the authorities began with thousands of motorists beeping their horns in Tbilisi and other cities signaling increasing anger against the Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili. Several hours after the protest President Saakashvili invited three television journalists to hold a live press conference. He downplayed the opposition's calls for Merabishvili's resignation as 'very funny' and said that he would strongly support the Minister claiming he was \\"really a very good Minister\\". Several hundred protesters gathered outside the President's Office on March 17 to demand Merabishvili's resignation and an unbiased investigation of a high-profile murder scandal. The rally, which was organized by some human right groups, was joined by the opposition Republican, New Rights, Conservative, Labor and Freedom parties, as well as by those outdoor market sellers, also protested against, what they described as, 'police violence'. On May 23 a small group of activists from the Equality Institute non-governmental organization went on hunger strike and staged a protest rally central Rustaveli Avenue outside the Parliament. Overnight the Georgian Patrol Police dispersed the protesters, arresting two of them and fining them GEL 7.5 for hooliganism. Interrogation and trial On June 20 investigators from the General Prosecutor's Office interrogated Data Akhalaia as well as Guram Donadze, the former Interior Ministry spokesman and the Interior Minister's wife Tako Salakaia. Despite numerous demands by Girgvliani's relatives their lawyer was not invited to attend the interrogation. Tbilisi City Court launched on June 27 hearings into the murder case. Tamar Maisuradze, a key witness into the case, told the court, that she was sitting at a table near to that of the Interior Ministry officials and the Interior Minister's wife. She also said that the victim was speaking emotionally, insulting Donadze but that she was not sure whether her or any other person sitting with him could have heard Girgvliani's words. At the court hearing on June 30 these key figures testified that they had heard nothing as music was playing loudly in the café. Investigators have ruled out that the murder was ordered and claim that the incident was a result of a spontaneous quarrel between the suspects and the victim. But the security guard at the café, also questioned by the court, ruled out that a quarrel, or incident took place outside the café. On July 3 the hearing turned into a confrontation between the opposition and the judge. Inside the courtroom some opposition politicians, including MP Davit Gamkrelidze, the leader of New Rights party, verbally sparred with judge Giorgi Chemia accusing him of bias. As a result, the judge demanded MP Gamkrelidze leave the courtroom. Meanwhile, outside the courtroom the City Court's guard refused entry to a group of opposition politicians, citing that the site was overcrowded. After the incident the Chairman of the Supreme Court Kote Kublashvili announced that Gamkrelidze would no longer be able to attend the trial because he was stirring too much noise and disorders at the hearings. Meanwhile, a few days later, Bukhaidze, told the court that Mikheil Bibiluri, one of the four suspects, was not at the scene of Sandro Girgvliani's death. He said that instead of Bibiluri, Oleg Melnikov, was the fourth attacker. \\"Today I can say for sure before the court: I recollected the fourth person in Okrokana [outskirts of Tbilisi, where Sandro Girgvliani’s body was located] and I can say for sure, that it was Oleg Melnikov\\" Bukhaidze added. On July 5 prosecutors accused key suspect into the case Gia Alania, former chief of the first unit of the Interior Ministry's Department for Constitutional Security, of deliberately inflicting injuries to Girgvliani, which resulted in the latter's death and demanded nine-year imprisonment for him. Prosecutors demanded eight-year imprisonment for each of other three suspects. Judge Chemia reached a decision on July 6. The Tbilisi City Court sentenced Gia Alania, ex-chief of the first unit of the Interior Ministry's Department for Constitutional Security (DCS), to eight-years imprisonment for Sandro Girgvliani's murder. The three other officers were jailed for seven years each. All of them were found guilty of inflicting injuries, which resulted in Girgvliani's death. Whilst Chemia was announcing his verdict a few hundred protesters rallied outside the Tbilisi City Court to condemn what they said was a biased trial. The Girgvliani family lawyer, Shalva Shavgulidze, said that the court had done everything to prevent \\"the whole truth about the case\\" being revealed. Clashes erupted in the court chambers after the announcement, as opposition party activists and relatives of Girgvliani tussled with the court marshalls. Several protesters, including the opposition Republican Party activist were detained for disorders. Four activists were released on July 29 after serving a 30-day prison sentence for violations of public order outside the Court of Appeals in Tbilisi. Their arrest was condemned by the Ombudsman, Sozar Subari, as illegal. Reaction The State Minister for Conflict Resolution Issues, Giorgi Khaindrava, who attended proceedings at Tbilisi City Court described the trial as 'inadequate'. I think upon the arrival from the United States, President Saakashvili should consider the issue and take relevant conclusions and decisions, because what we are now seeing here [in the court] is a sign of a crisis\\" Khaindrava told reporters. He went on to say on July 7 that \\"This [Sandro Girgvliani’s murder] was such a case that I would have resigned if I were the Interior Minister\\". Khaindrava, was later sacked on July 21 for not following the official line issues and announced that he has joined the Equality Institute, a human rights group. During the scandal the group held a series of protest rallies in Tbilisi demanding a fair investigation into Girgvliani's murder. John Tefft, the U.S. Ambassador to Georgia, told the Associated Press that \\"It has been our position to make quite clear to the government that we expect no cover-ups and that those who are responsible should be brought to justice,\\" The daily 24 Saati (24 Hours) meanwhile wrote the next day that the judiciary had 'failed to pass the public test'. In an opinion article the publication remarked that \\"As anticipated, during announcement of the verdict the presiding judge Giorgi Chemia has not named a motive behind Sandro Girgvliani’s murder, as well as said nothing about those who have ordered the murder. The judge has ended hastily-conducted trial yesterday - it took just ten days - and ignored the position and evidence put forth by the victim’s attorney,\\" The daily Rezonansi wrote in its article \\"Society Against Authorities\\", that whilst President Saakashvili was in the United States, Georgia was on the verge of a political crisis. Continuing scandal Irina Enukidze, the mother of Girgvliani, claimed on May 2 that unspecified representatives of the authorities had offered her money in exchange for her silence and the conclusion of her pursuit of Merabishvili's resignation. to the issue of public discussions over this matter. \\"They [referring to authorities] offered me any sum in exchange for me keeping silent. Otherwise, they threatened to silence me by force. They also prohibited me from having any contact with the opposition. Now, I want to answer to the authors of these proposals - they have made a huge mistake.\\" On July 12, prosecutors launched an investigation into the testimony provided by Levan Bukhaidze, the Chief of Tbilisi's Prosecutors Office said. He was summoned for interrogation over his recent testimony on July 11. If the testimony by Bukhaidze were to be confirmed [that Melnikov was at the crime scene on January 28], it would undermine the entire official motives behind the crime - that the murder occurred as a result of a spontaneous row between the victim and four former police officials outside the Sheredan café in downtown Tbilisi. Patrol Policeman Grigol Bashaleishvili was found guilty and sentenced to four-years imprisonment on August 10 by the Tbilisi City Court of the negligent murder of 19-year-old Amiran Robakidze on 23 November 2004. However relatives of the victim and some human rights groups have condemned the trial as an attempt to cover up higher-level Interior Ministry officials, who allegedly fabricated evidence. Robakidze's relatives and some human right groups have called for the prosecution of Interior Ministry officials who provided false crime scene evidence. In particular, Guram Donadze, one man at the centre of Sanrdo Girgvliani's murder, was singled out as a possible suspect. Media pressure During this period the influential media tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili, owner of the Imedi television station, stated that the Georgian authorities were mounting pressure on his station and other businesses after it had broadcast details of the Sandro Girgvliani murder case scandal. \\"It is no secret that Imedi television was the first one which reported the circumstances of Sandro Girgvliani’s murder...this alone became a reason for the authorities’ dissatisfaction, which triggered the financial authorities to actively launch a probe into my businesses and my companies so [as] to force me to mount pressure against [my] journalists..and facilitate the creation of a favorable image of the authorities.\\" Badri Patarkatsishvili went on to say that he would never yield to pressure from the authorities. Shortly after this statement influential government MP Giga Bokeria convened a news conference and accused Patarkatsishvili of blackmailing the authorities \\"It appears that he [Patarkatsishvili] cannot forget his past – Russia during [ex-President Boris] Yeltsin's presidency, when he and his friends controlled everything – the authorities, business and seized huge amounts of property. However, present-day Georgia is not Yeltsin’s Russia. At the same time, present-day Georgia is not [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's Russia, where political opponents are persecuted or arrested, where televisions are closed down. I want to stress that television, freedom of speech is untouchable. Mr. Patarkatsishvili can be engaged in politics, business - but he will not be able to blackmail the authorities through his own television or influence\\". On July 6 Eka Khoperia, an anchor with Rustavi 2 TV, announced during her live program that she was resigning, after Data Akhalaia refused to take part in her talk show unless he will be able to speak after opposition representatives as a final guest. Khoperia said that this condition was unacceptable. Sandro Girgvliani's high-profile murder case was the topic of Eka Khoperia's talk show on July 6. Khoperia announced during the show that she had been informed that interview with Data Akhalaia, ex-chief of the Interior Ministry's Department for Constitutional Security, will take place only on his conditions, otherwise he would not be available. Akhalaia had been accused by Girgvliani's relatives, some human right groups, and certain opposition parties of being behind the murder case. \\"But the condition was that Akhalaia should have been last [guest] of the program; such conditions are absolutely unacceptable for me. Also I think that when such a murder [referring to the Girgvliani's case] occurs in the country the Interior Minister should at least resign. So this is my last program and I quit this channel [Rustavi 2].\\" After the statement, Khoperia announced an advertising break, but the programme did not resume. Eka Khoperia's statement was interpreted by some opposition activists as an evidence of pressure on journalists of the Rustavi 2. Rustavi 2 has often been accused by the opposition of toeing the official line of President Saakashvili's administration. It has also been widely speculated on that the channel's editorial policy was largely determined by officials from the ruling National Movement party. The General-Director of Rustavi 2, Nika Tabatadze, denied that Khoperia, was under pressure from the Rustavi 2 management or the authorities. The Rustavi 2 TV chief also said that he talked with Khoperia after the program and said that Rustavi 2 is ready to continue cooperation with Eka Khoperia'. Eka Khoperia herself also denied that it was Minister of Interior who spoke with her about Akhalaia See also *Human rights in Georgia External links * Georgian Police Claim To Solve High- Profile Murder (Eurasia Daily Monitor) * Protestors Demands Georgian Interior Minister's Resignation (Kvali Opinion) * Despite Scandals, Georgia's Opposition Fails To Impress (Central Asia - Caucasus Analyst * High-Profile Murder Case Trial Ends, But Questions Remain (Civil Georgia) * Georgia: Murder Case Verdict Stirs Controversy (EurasiaNet) 2006 crimes in Georgia (country) 2000s murders in Georgia (country) Georgia) Georgia) People murdered in Georgia (country) Political controversies in Georgia (country) 2000s in Tbilisi Crime in Tbilisi Murder victims from Georgia (country) ","title":"Sandro Girgvliani murder case"},{"id":"6489057","title":"Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)"},{"id":"6489064","text":"Alameda Point is the name given to the lands of the former Naval Air Station Alameda in the City of Alameda, California.

NAS Alameda was identified for closure under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program in 1993, and ceased operation in April 1997. An agreement between the Navy and the City of Alameda for transferring the land to the City for future development was reached in 2006. One of the larger issues between the Navy and the City has been paying the costs of the environmental cleanup required. Prior to the transfer, some of the facilities of the former base have been leased to private tenants, and the City of Alameda.

Beginning in late 2006 the Mythbusters began to test various experiments on the former runway while in 2009, NBC's Trauma staged a plane crash. Redevelopment The City of Alameda has been planning the redevelopment of Alameda Point since 2000. Complicating the redevelopment are number of constraints associated with the approximate . There are land use constraints consisting of Tidelands Trust, soil and groundwater contamination,http://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/search.asp?cmd=search&city;=Alameda&zip;=&county;=&federal;_superfund=True&state;_response=True&voluntary;_cleanup=True&school;_cleanup=True&permitted;=True&corrective;_action=True&display;_results=Report&pub;=True California DTSC and wildlife refuge buffer requirements. Physical constraints include geotechnical issues and 100 year flood plans. Institutional and contractual constraints revolve around Alameda Measure A, the Alameda Naval Air Station Historic District and existing residents and leases. In August 2001, Alameda selected Alameda Point Community Partners as the master developer for the property. Alameda Point Community Partners (APCP) was a partnership of financier Morgan Stanley, Shea Homes of Livermore, Centex Homes of Dallas and the Industrial Realty Group. The development was estimated to cost $2 billion and take 15 years to complete. Alameda Point Community Partners was selected over Catellus and Harbor Bay/Lennar, and signed a two- year exclusive negotiating contract as the property's master developer. By 2005, only Shea Homes and Centex Homes were working on redevelopment plans, and a Preliminary Development Concept called for building 1,700 homes on the site. In July 2006, the City of Alameda and the Navy agreed to a $108 million purchase deal. In September 2006, APCP decided that it would not move forward with the development plan identified in the Preliminary Development Concept and withdrew from the project. In May 2007, the City selected SunCal Companies as the master developer from a field of five applicant firms that sought to redevelop 770 acres. In July 2007, the City and SunCal entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement as SunCal began to gather community input and develop preliminary plans. In August 2010, the Alameda City Council voted unanimously to terminate the exclusive negotiating agreement with SunCal and halt its proposal for the former Naval Air Station. Various reasons were cited in the staff report leading up to the vote, including a developer- and city- initiated ballot measure related to the project that was defeated in February 2010 by a margin of 85%. SunCal had incurred over $17 million in expenses over the three years it worked on developing plans for the property.

History The first light on Goat Island was constructed in 1823-1824, but was later transported to Prudence Island in 1851 where the structure still remains as the Prudence Island Light. The current light was constructed in 1842 a few yards off the coast of Goat Island and was connected to Goat Island by a narrow dike (the area was filled in the 1960s for the hotel) because the previous light failed in adequately warning ships of a reef just a few yards off Goat Island. The original lighting apparatus was, however, transferred to the newer lighthouse in 1842. In 1864 an attached lighthouse keeper's house was built. In 1921, a submarine hit the breakwater, damaging the foundation of the keeper's house. An electric light was placed in the tower the following year. The damaged keeper's dwelling was later torn down. After a private developer purchased Goat Island in the 1960s, the land between the northern end of Goat Island and the light was filled in to build a hotel. On March 30, 1988, the light was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2000 the Coast Guard leased the light to the American Lighthouse Foundation; it is managed by the Friends of Newport Harbor Lighthouse.

It is 23 cm in length, with a wingspan of 46–51 cm. The species breeds colonially on islands off the southern California coast of the United States and off the Baja Peninsula and Gulf of California of Mexico. Nesting sites are usually in rock crevices, occasionally in small burrows in soft earth. It also uses unused burrows from auklets. Colonies are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predatory birds such as gulls, hawks and owls. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. The female lays a single white egg per breeding season, if the egg is lost then it is replaced only rarely. Both parents share incubation duties, incubation lasting around 50 days. The chick is brooded for a few days after hatching until it is able to thermoregulate by itself, after which both parents forage to provide food. Chicks fledge 10 weeks after hatching. The black storm petrel spends the rest of the year at sea, but occurring closer to shore than most other storm-petrels. Because of this, it sometimes can be seen from the mainland. It undertakes a migration away from the waters surrounding its breeding colonies and, unusually, has two wintering grounds, one in the California Current off Central California and another further south off the coast of Central America as far south as Colombia and Ecuador. It is thought to migrate in this fashion in order to avoid hurricanes in its breeding grounds. It feeds on mainly planktonic crustaceans, with a preference of larvae of spiny lobster. It will also take small fish and offal. It feeds using several techniques, including plunge diving to 1 m below the water's surface from flight, feeding while swimming on the surface, and feeding while flying. At sea it usually forages singly. The black storm petrel is a common species, numbering several million pairs, and is not considered threatened. It has suffered losses on some of the breeding islands, particularly from feral cats and rats. Island restoration projects have removed these predators from several of its nesting islands.

On 30 April 1732, he married Anne Marie de Champagne de Villaines de la Suze. After having served in the Army, he was appointed in 1756 ambassador in Vienna to Emperor Francis I and Queen Maria Theresa of Hungary. In 1761, he was plenipotentiary to the Augsburg Convention. From 13 October 1761 to 8 April 1766, he served as Secretary of State (minister) for Foreign Affairs, replacing in this office his cousin Étienne de Choiseul (who became in 1763 Secretary of State for War and for Navy). He was lieutenant general of the Armies. In 1763, he was made duke of Praslin and peer of France. He negotiated the peace that ended the Seven Years' War and was Louis XV's plenipotentiary for the conclusion of the Treaty of Paris, which he signed, on 10 February 1763. From 10 April 1766 to 24 December 1770, he served as Secretary of State for the Navy (his cousin Étienne then taking back the department of Foreign Affairs in addition to that of War). During his term in office, he restored the strength of the Navy, which had been severely damaged during the Seven Years' War. After the death, in 1764, of Madame de Pompadour, who had been their protector, the position of César Gabriel and his cousin Étienne was undermined. He fell from grace in Louis XV's court and withdrew from public affairs in 1770, at the height of the Falkland Crisis involving Britain and Spain. He was replaced at the Navy by abbé Terray. His titles included marquis of Choiseul, count of Chevigny and of La Rivière, viscount of Melun and of Vaux, baron of La Flèche and of Giry, lord of Chassy.

Origin The third World Esperanto Congress was held in 1907 in Cambridge, England. It is probable that Lord Baden-Powell was aware of the proceedings. After the first Scout camp which at Brownsea later that year, Baden-Powell was writing his book Scouting for Boys covering the method in which Scouting could be adapted to youth. This work appeared in the form of six small booklets, published every two weeks. The first of the series appeared on January 15, 1908 and the series had so much success that in May of the same year, the set was published in the form of a unified book. In the third book of the series, Baden-Powell advised the Scouts as recourse to use the international language Esperanto as a \\"secret language of the patrol\\". The passage in question disappeared in some later editions,See Scouting for Boys, no mention of Esperanto after \\"who understand signalling\\" however one could read on page 202 of Scouting for Boys, in the original version: Membership card :\\"Also if you want to use a secret language in your patrol, you should all set to work to learn \\"Esperanto\\". It is not difficult, and is taught in a little book costing one penny. This language is being used in all countries so that you would be able to get on it abroad now.\\"Scouting for Boys, p. 202, or Scouting for Boys, before \\"Whistle and Flag Signals\\" The fact that Baden- Powell mentioned Esperanto in Scouting for Boys is interesting in that Baden- Powell held Esperanto in regard and that he had spoken about it with his wife, Lady Olave Baden-Powell. Indeed, after B-P's death, in a 1950 letter to Mrs. Dr. Lydia DeVilbis, Lady Olave wrote \\"I often thought that it would be splendid if Mrs. Roosevelt could convince the United States to make Esperanto accepted in the whole world and to introduce it into the programs of all schools and organizations. It would really be of the highest importance for the world and especially useful for good understanding between people who are divided because of the diversity of languages.\\" Mrs. Roosevelt was, at the time of this letter, president of the Committee of Human Rights of the United Nations. This perhaps helped prepare the ground for recommendations of UNESCO in favor of Esperanto proclaimed in 1954 and 1985. Following the immediate spread of Scouting in 1907, it soon became apparent to many that the Scouts might really be able to succeed at the experiment of international fraternity. Alexander William Thompson, leader of an English troop, had the idea on a French battlefield in 1918 to found an international Esperanto speaking Scouting organization to support international friendship and exchange of services. In order to cure the linguistic problems, he recommended Esperanto as an international means of communication. The same year saw the foundation of the League of Esperanto-speaking Scouts as an international Scout organization, which thus predates the World Organization of the Scout Movement, though not the Order of World Scouts from 1911. Much is unknown about what Baden-Powell thought of Esperanto, but he liked the idea of an international Scout organization; two years later, in 1920, the World Bureau of Scouting was founded, however without using Esperanto, having English and French as official languages. A.W. Thompson became president of the League of Esperanto-speaking Scouts, and his brother K. Graham Thompson the Secretary of Honor. Thereafter, Norman Booth, another British Scoutmaster became secretary- general of honor and seceded with treasurer D.H. David to organize the Skolta Esperanto Ligo (SEL). This new association organized multiple international Scout camps to achieve its goals and to test the use of Esperanto in Scouting: in 1922 in the Netherlands, 1923 in Belgium, 1924 in Denmark, 1925 in Spain, 1926 in Czechoslovakia (there were even radio broadcasts in Prague about Scouting in Esperanto), 1927 in Spain, 1928 in Belgium, 1929 during the World Jamboree in England, 1930 in the Netherlands, a camp in which participated a SEL member, Harold Wilson, who would become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976). Almost 100 Esperanto speaking Scouts from 18 countries, as far away as Japan, took part in the 1929 World Jamboree in Birkenhead. Modern era On August 22, 1969, the Skolta Esperanto Ligo officially presented the first Esperanto-language Scout book, \\"Ĵamborea Lingvo\\" (the Jamboree's Language), to members of the World Scout Conference held in Helsinki, Finland. A new version appeared in 1995. \\"La Skolta Mondo\\" is the official bulletin of the SEL.

The chief judge commonly presides over trials and hearings.  Australia  In Australia the term Chief Judge can refer to the principal judicial officer of a state District Court, as in New South Wales, or a state County Court, as in Victoria. The former is appointed by the state's Governor, while the latter may be appointed by the state's Attorney-General.  United States   United States courts of appeals  In the United States courts of appeals, the chief judge has certain administrative responsibilities and presides over en banc sessions of the court and meetings of the Judicial Council. The chief judge remains an active judge of the court hearing and deciding cases, but at their option may elect to take on a reduced caseload to provide time to perform administrative responsibilities. In order to qualify for the office of chief judge, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy in the office of chief judge is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position. Unlike the Chief Justice of the United States, a chief judge returns to active service after the expiration of their term and does not create a vacancy on the bench by the fact of their promotion. See . These rules have applied since October 1, 1982. The office of chief judge was created in 1948 and until August 6, 1959 was filled by the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. From then until 1982 it was filled by the senior such judge who had not turned 70. Lists of the judges who have served as chief judge of each of the courts of appeals can be found in the articles for the respective circuits, such as United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  United States district courts  In United States district courts with at least two judges, the chief judge has certain administrative responsibilities, including presiding over some meetings of the judges.

Since Plato never completed the Critias for an unknown reason, it is generally assumed that he never began writing the Hermocrates. In any case, the persons that would have appeared are very likely to be the same as in the former dialogues – Timaeus, Critias, Hermocrates, and Socrates – and the unnamed companion mentioned at the beginning of the Timaeus might have unveiled his identity. The intention of Plato to write this third dialogue becomes evident among others, from the following passage of Critias: Hermocrates had only a small share of the conversation in the previous dialogues. Since the Critias recounted the story of the ideal state in ancient Athens of nine thousand years ago – and why it was able to repel the invasion by the imperialist naval power Atlantis – by referring to prehistoric accounts via Solon and the Egyptians, it might have been Hermocrates' task to tell how the imperialist naval power, into which Athens of Plato's lifetime had turned, had suffered a bitter defeat in the Sicilian expedition against Syracuse and eventually in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta – since he was a Syracusan strategos during the time of the Sicilian expedition. The sequence of names of the three participants in these dialogues could also have a significance. The name of Timaeus is derived from the Greek word τιμάω, timaō meaning to pay honor to; the name of Critias is derived from the word κρίσις, krisis meaning judgment; and the name of Hermocrates, means gifted by Hermes, messenger of the gods. In popular culture In the video game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis the Lost Dialogue of Plato is known as the Hermocrates. In the game, the book was actually existent in an English manuscript, translated by one of the characters, and was an important tool for Dr. Jones throughout the game. Its contents, however, are about the location of Atlantis, entry to the city, and notes about its inhabitants and culture.

He also played two seasons in the North American Soccer League. Career In 1978, Henderson began his career with Shamrock Rovers. Mainly a reserve goalkeeper, he made his League of Ireland debut on 25 April 1978 and impressed enough to be called into the Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team, earning two caps in 1979. Also in 1979, Henderson spent his summer on loan to the Toronto Blizzard of the North American Soccer League. Henderson returned to Shamrock Rovers and soon established himself in the first team. From 1977 to 1981 he made 35 league appearances, keeping 20 clean sheets. He also played one game in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. In 1981, Johnny Giles signed him for the Vancouver Whitecaps and he helped them win the Northwest Division, before losing in the play-off first-round game to Tampa Bay Rowdies. On returning to Ireland, Henderson joined St. Patrick's Athletic, making his debut against Home Farm on 22 November 1981. He won his first trophy, the Leinster Senior Cup in December 1982. Teammate Paul McGrath later said that \\"Henderson was as good a goalkeeper as I've played in front of\\". Henderson signed for Home Farm F.C. in November 1984, spending two uneventful seasons before signing for Drogheda United in 1986. Throughout the 1980s, Henderson had been a regular member of the League of Ireland XI squad. When the FAI were asked by the Olympic Council of Ireland to put forward a team to attempt qualification for the 1988 Olympic Games, Henderson would add Olympic caps to his league and U21 honours. In 1987 Henderson was signed by Brian Kerr for his second spell with St. Patrick's Athletic. In his first year back, St. Pats finished in second place. Two years later they went one better, winning the club's first League of Ireland championship in thirty-four years. A feature of Henderson's time with St. Pats would be his enforced absence from game due to work commitments. Henderson was a full-time fireman and often called away at short notice. In 1990/91 he added a further Leinster Senior Cup medal and a Presidents Cup winners medal (where he saved three penalties in the deciding penalty shoot-out. Unfortunately for St. Pats they hit a severe financial crisis and most of their championship winning team left. Henderson joined Mick Moody and John McDonnell in joining Shamrock Rovers. In September 2009, Henderson was inducted into the St. Pats hall of fame. Henderson stayed with Shamrock Rovers for only season, making 31 appearances and keeping 14 clean sheets, before joining crosstown rivals Bohemians where he played in every league game and finished top of the league table in his first season, 1992–93 League of Ireland Premier Division. However, as the League rules stated a title could not be won on goal difference, Bohemians were forced into a play-off with Shelbourne and Cork City, with Cork coming out on top after 9 games. Henderson would continue to play for Bohemians until his retirement in 1998. His last game was a 1–0 win over Finn Harps on 22 February 1998. He came close to adding another title in 1995/96 before eventually losing out to St. Patrick's Athletic. Since retiring as a player, Henderson has worked as a scout or a coach for Aston Villa, Derry City, Bohemians and Hibernian. Personal Henderson is a member of an Irish goalkeeping dynasty. His father, Paddy Henderson, played for Shamrock Rovers in the 1960s, winning the FAI Cup in 1962.

Basin F had a maximum capacity of and covered approximately . Throughout the operation of Basin F, the saline concentration increased as water evaporated. The liquid formerly stored in Basin F is very salty water that contains some metals, hydrazine, wastewater, and toxic organics, which are about 1 percent of the liquid. Interim response The Basin F Interim Response Action began in March 1988 and involved the transfer by tank truck of of Basin F liquid to three holding tanks and approximately to a double-lined holding pond. In May 1988, near the start of the project, a heavy rainfall classified as a 25-year/24-hour event occurred which increased the volume of Basin F liquid. In June 1988, a tornado touched down near the tanks and ponds. The need to inspect and repair structures and equipment affected by the twister caused a minor schedule delay. The increased volume of liquid in Basin F caused by the heavy rainfall in May 1988 required additional storage capacity. Two double-lined holding ponds were constructed: a pond (Pond B) and an pond (Pond A). The of basin overburden, liner, and subsoils were excavated and placed in a waste pile located within the basin area. Remediation of Basin F  The basin floor was capped with of compact clay and of topsoil and revegetated with native grass. This portion of the Basin F Interim Response Action was completed in August 1989. Once the liquid was drained from Basin F, the drying of the soils, sediments, and liner began. This project caused an odor resulting in discomfort to members of the surrounding community. Because of the Army's concern for the comfort of the local community during the soil drying, air purifiers were distributed to affected homes in the community to help alleviate the odors. When the odor problem began, the Army asked several health agencies to study the problem to determine if there were any long-term or acute health effects. Toxicologists from Colorado State Health Department, United States Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Shell Oil Company, Tri-County Health, the Army's Surgeon General's Office, and Foster-Wheeler (or previously, Ebasco, the contractor for the project) identified the compounds and determined that there were no acute health effects. The odors ended with the completion of the excavation in December 1988. The total cost of the project was about $45 million. The decision on the final disposal of the liquid was reached in March 1990.

International Prognostic Index  One point is assigned for each of the following risk factors: * Age greater than 60 years * Stage III or IV disease * Elevated serum LDH * ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 2, 3, or 4 * More than 1 extranodal site The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups: * Low risk (0-1 points) - 5-year survival of 73% * Low- intermediate risk (2 points) - 5-year survival of 51% * High-intermediate risk (3 points) - 5-year survival of 43% * High risk (4-5 points) - 5-year survival of 26%  Age-Adjusted IPI  A simplified index can be used when comparing patients within an age group (i.e. 60 or younger, or over 60) and includes only 3 of the above factors: * Stage * LDH * Performance status The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups: * Low risk (0 points) - 5-year survival of 83% * Low-intermediate risk (1 point) - 5-year survival of 69% * High-intermediate risk (2 points) - 5-year survival of 46% * High risk (3 points) - 5-year survival of 32% Although the IPI has shown itself to be a useful clinical tool, widely used by oncologists and a mainstay of risk stratification in clinical trials for lymphoma, it should be kept in mind that it was developed prior to the use of rituximab, which is now included with anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy as of the standard of care in B-cell lymphomas (the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). Rituximab has significantly improved the outcomes of lymphoma patients; and its effect on the prognostic value of the IPI is uncertain. Future development of a more rigorous prognostic index may thus be useful.  Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)  Given the success of the IPI for intermediate grade lymphomas, an effort was undertaken to develop a similar prognostic index for the most common low-grade lymphoma, follicular lymphoma. The prognostic factors that emerged from this were: age, stage, number of lymph node areas involved, serum hemoglobin level, and serum LDH.Solal-Céligny et al. Follicular lymphoma international prognostic index. Blood 2004;104(5):1258-1265. One point is assigned for each of the following adverse prognostic factors: * Age greater than 60 years * Stage III or IV disease * Greater than 4 lymph node groups involved * Serum hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL * Elevated serum LDH The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups: * Low risk (0-1 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 91% and 71%, respectively * Intermediate risk (2 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 78% and 51%, respectively * High risk (3-5 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 53% and 36%, respectively  Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI)  An effort was more recently undertaken to identify a similar prognostic index predictive of outcome in advanced mantle cell lymphoma. There were four factors found to have independent prognostic relevance: age, performance status, LDH, and white blood cell count (WBC).Hoster et al. A new prognostic index (MIPI) for patients with advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma. Blood 2008;111(2):558-565. The point values are assigned as follows: * 0 points: Age less than 50 years, ECOG performance status of 0-1, LDH less than 0.67 of the upper limit of normal, or WBC of less than 6,700 cells/mcl * 1 point: Age 50-59, LDH 0.67-0.99 of the upper limit of normal, or WBC 6,700 to 9,999 cells/mcl * 2 points: Age 60-69, ECOG performance status of 2-4, LDH 1-1.49 times the upper limit of normal, or WBC 10,000-14,000 cells/mcl * 3 points: Age 70 or greater, LDH 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or greater, and WBC of 15,000 cells/mcl or greater The sum of the allotted points correlates with the following risk groups: * Low risk (0-3 points) - median survival not yet reached * Intermediate risk (4-5 points) - median survival of 51 months * High risk (6-11 points) - median survival of 29 months See also * Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognosis * Continuous Individualized Risk Index  References  Hematology Oncology ","title":"International Prognostic Index"},{"id":"6489432","text":"Point O'Woods or Point O' Woods may refer to *Point O'Woods Golf & Country Club *Point O' Woods, New York ","title":"Point O' Woods"},{"id":"6489461","title":"George Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Abercorn"},{"id":"6489485","text":"Santangelo is an Italian surname and may refer to: * Santangelo novels, a series of novels by Jackie Collins ** Santangelo family, a fictional family from the novels People with the surname Santangelo * F.

The death of King John VI of Portugal (1826) created a dispute over royal succession. While Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, was the king's oldest son, his younger brother Miguel contended that Pedro had forfeited his claim to the Portuguese throne by declaring Brazil's independence. Pedro briefly entitled himself king (as Pedro IV of Portugal). Neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy again. So, Pedro abdicated in favor of his daughter, Maria, a child of 7, with his sister Isabel Maria as regent. However, the absolutist party of the landowners and the Church, were not satisfied with this compromise, and they continued to regard Miguel as the legitimate successor to the throne on the grounds that according to the Portuguese succession rules (approved by the Cortes after the 1640 Restoration), Pedro had lost the right to the Portuguese crown, when he took possession of a foreign crown (Brazil). They also were alarmed by the liberal reforms that had been initiated in Spain by the liberals In February 1828, Miguel returned to Portugal to take the oath of allegiance to the Charter and assume the regency. The Cortes of 1828 proclaiming him king as Miguel I of Portugal and he reigned from 1828 to 1834. But in the end (after the Liberal Wars) the Miguelists (absolutists) were defeated and the king was exiled.Jean Pailler; Maria Pia of Braganza: The Pretender. New York: ProjectedLetters, 2006. Legitimism The Legitimists () are royalists in France who adhere to the rights of dynastic succession of the descendants of the elder branch of the Bourbon dynasty, which was overthrown in the 1830 July Revolution. Sedevacantism Sedevacantism holds that the current Roman Catholic pope, Francis, is illegitimate. More generally, sedevacantists believe that the chair of St. Peter has been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958 or Pope John XXIII in 1963 and that subsequent holders of the papal throne have not been true popes. This movement is largely driven by opposition to liturgical reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council, especially replacement of the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Paul VI and authorizing the saying of the Mass in vernacular languages rather than ecclesiastical Latin.

It was built in 2005 and is the current home of Burton Albion FC, replacing the club's old Eton Park home, also on Princess Way, which was demolished and developed into housing. The ground was built on the former site of the Pirelli UK Tyres Ltd Sports & Social Club, and having had the land donated to the club by Pirelli, in return for naming rights, the ground cost £7.2 million to build. The ground was designed by architects Hadfield, Cawkwell and Davidson, and has served as the inspiration for numerous newer grounds, including Morecambe's Globe Arena, and the proposed Hayes & Yeading stadium. It gained its most recent safety certificate from Staffordshire County Council on 12 July 2010, having been subject to crowd trouble on 8 May 2010 at the hands of Grimsby Town fans following their relegation from Football League Two. The ground has seen minor capacity changes since its construction, and the current capacity stands at 6,912, with 2,034 being seated in the South (Main) Stand. The current record attendance for the stadium stands at 6,746 for an EFL Championship match against nearby Derby County. History Planning and construction Plans for a new ground for Burton Albion had existed since July 2003, when it was becoming apparent that the club's progress and ambition on the pitch was not matched by their current Eton Park stadium, despite having spent £1 million to bring the ground up to Football Conference standards following their recent promotion to that league. A new stadium would need to be created to Football League standards in the event of a further promotion. In June 2003 it was revealed that the club were hoping to acquire land on the Pirelli Sports and Social Club, with artists' impressions of the new ground first appearing on 6 August 2003. This date coincided with the club submitting planning proposals to Staffordshire County Council for the new ground, originally intended to have a capacity of 6,000, representing a 25% increase on the capacity of Eton Park. The original proposals also included a new training pitch to be available for community use, whilst also incorporating relocation of the Eton Park Bowling Club and Football Tavern. Club chairman Ben Robinson outlined the need for the stadium to be the focal point of football in the local community, claiming \\"The new football ground will provide modern facilities for the club to secure its ongoing development, and enable it to offer better coaching within the community and provide better facilities for schools and local clubs.\\" The planning proposal also included a planning application to allow the redevelopment of Eton Park into residential properties, a move intended to fund the construction of the new stadium, and also a proposal by Pirelli to include new distribution units on their adjacent national distribution centre. Artistic impressions were submitted to the local council by architects Hadfield, Cawkwell and Davidson, of Sheffield. Construction work was carried out by Burton firm Bison, who were the club's shirt sponsors at the time. Work began in December 2003 in anticipation for being ready for the 2004–05 season. Conference years (2005–2009) South Stand The first fixture at the new ground was held on 16 July 2005 with a pre-season friendly against Chester City. A crowd of 1,341 saw Chester defeat the Brewers 1–0, with the distinction of scoring the first goal at the stadium landing to Chester trialist Avun Jephcott. The first Albion player to score at the ground was trialist Kevin Street in a pre-season friendly against Hull City, a match that ended in a 2–2 draw. The ground was officially opened on 14 November 2005 with a friendly match against Manchester United. Special guests Sir Alex Ferguson, Pirelli managing director Dominic Sandivasci and Barbara Clough, widow of Brian Clough and mother of then-Brewers manager Nigel Clough, marked the ceremony by unveiling a plaque. In the match itself, a crowd of 6,065 saw the Brewers defeat the young United side 2–1. Just before this match the stadium's official capacity having been fully completed had been set by Staffordshire County Council's safety committee at 6,068. The first competitive fixture held at the ground was a Football Conference fixture against Grays Athletic on 13 August 2005. 1,654 people witnessed a 1–1, with Aaron Webster scoring the stadium's first competitive goal. Later that season on 8 January 2006, with the stadium's capacity now increased to 6,200, the stadium's capacity record was broken in an FA Cup third-round match, ironically again against Manchester United, against whom the previous record had been set. 6,191 saw the Brewers bely their non-league status against the Premier League side, earning a 0–0 draw, forcing a replay at Old Trafford. This is still the record FA Cup attendance at the ground. The match also saw the introduction of a new electronic scoreboard, placed in the Eastern side of the South Stand, however this was the only game that the board functioned. CCTV was installed around the perimeter of the stadium in 2007 following a spate of vandalism, including rocks being thrown at the shop window, and trees planted as part of a landscaping project around the stadium being uprooted and damaged. On one occasion a wooden cable drum was rolled across the car park through a fence and into a drainage channel. A new electronic scoreboard was installed prior to the 2008–09 season, however it first functioned in a Setanta Shield match against Kidderminster Harriers on 4 November 2008. The new board is suspended from the roof of the Coors Visitor Stand, prohibiting its view from the away supporters.Burton Albion Football Club: Champions 2008-2009 DVD. Retrieved 16 August 2010. Football League (2009–present) Prior to the club's inaugural season in the Football League, in June 2009 the club was given the go-ahead to raise the official capacity of the ground by 712, indicating a rise from 6,200, which had been the agreed capacity at the inauguration of the stadium, to 6,912, an increase of more than 10 percent, following discussion with safety inspectors and Staffordshire County Council. The club was also encouraged to fund a toucan crossing for pedestrians crossing the adjacent Princess Way, due to the increase in fans that had coincided with the club's promotion. Work on this project began on 2 August 2009, having originally been proposed during the planning stages of the stadium construction. These moves were acknowledged with a renewal of the stadium's safety certificate on 12 July 2010 by the council's safety advisory group. The stadium hosted its first ever Football League match on 15 August 2009 against Morecambe, in a match that attracted a crowd of 2,742. Goals from Shaun Harrad, John McGrath, Russell Penn and a Greg Pearson brace ensured a 5–2 victory for the Brewers against their former Conference rivals. The first hat-trick at the stadium was also the first hat-trick scored by a Brewers player in the Football League, achieved by Greg Pearson in a 6–1 victory over Aldershot Town on 12 December 2009. This scoreline is also the Brewers' record victory margin at the stadium. The stadium also witnessed one of the highest scoring matches in Football League history on 13 March 2010 when the Brewers were defeated 5–6 by Cheltenham Town. Structure and facilities Layout of Pirelli Stadium The stadium is divided into four single-tier stands. The South (Main) stand is the only all-seater stand, boasting a capacity of 2,034, which is segregated to provide seating for both home and away fans, whilst the ground also has three terraced stands, the West Stand (formerly the Bovril end, currently named the Don Amott stand for sponsorship purposes), and the North Stand (currently named the ColaRebell Stand, although commonly known as the Popside) are the two home terraces, whilst the East (Coors Visitor) stand terrace accommodates the away support. The Main stand also boasts off the pitch facilities, including conference rooms, with the largest holding 300 people, the press room, medical facilities, club shop and the Burton Albion Study Centre. On match days there are eight directors boxes available, across the Main stand. The club's main administration facilities are also located in this stand. There are four bars, one located inside each of the stands, which are all open before and during games. Other features of the stadium include the scoreboard located on the roof of the East stand, and the Police Control Box located in the corner between the South and East stands. Groundsman Simon Marshall has received several accolades for his maintenance of the Pirelli Stadium pitch, including runner-up for Groundsman Of The Year in the Football Conference for the 2008–09 season, and Groundsman Of The Year in Football League Two for the 2009–10 season. Other uses View from the Coors visitor stand The ground hosted an England C European Challenge Trophy match against Netherlands C on 29 November 2006. Goals from Steve Morison, Kieran Charnock, George Boyd, Craig Mackail-Smith resulted in a 4–1 victory for the home side. On 26 August 2009 the ground hosted an England Under-17's international match against Italy Under 17's, the match ending in a 1–1 draw. On 30 April 2010 the ground played host to an England Under-18 Schoolboys international against the Republic Of Ireland, which ended in a 1–0 victory for the Irish. The stadium acted as a neutral venue for a 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship elite qualification match between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. Two goals from Jordy Brouwer resulted in a 2–0 victory for the Dutch. Between 2006 and 2008 the stadium hosted the Conference North playoff finals before being dropped in favour of drawing one of the finalists' own grounds. During the 2007–08 season Derby County announced that a number of their reserve matches would be placed at the ground, although this arrangement was discontinued following the Brewers promotion to the Football League. Records The record attendance at Pirelli Stadium is currently 6,746 for a Championship match against Derby County on 26 August 2016. Previous records include 6,450 for an EFL Cup match against Liverpool on 23 August 2016,Recap: Burton Albion 0-5 Liverpool in the EFL Cup, Origi and Sturridge get doubles for Reds Burton Mail, 23 August 2016 6,192 for a Conference National league match against Oxford United on 17 April 2009,> which was of significant importance as a draw or win for the Brewers would have earned them the Conference title, however the match finished 1–0 to Oxford, thanks to an Adam Chapman free-kick. The prior record attendance and also current FA Cup record attendance at the ground is 6,191, set on 8 January 2006 in a third-round match against Manchester United. The match ended 0–0 with the then non-league Brewers forcing a replay at Old Trafford against their Premier League opponents. The highest attendance for a Football League match at the ground is 6,148, set on 5 May 2013 for a 3–1 defeat to Bradford City in the Play-offs. The record attendance for a non-competitive match was set on 14 November 2005, also against Manchester United. The Brewers won the match 2–1, in a match organised for the stadium's official opening, which attracted 6,065 people. The lowest league attendance at the ground is 1,235, set on 25 April 2006 for a Conference National match against Dagenham & Redbridge. The lowest attendance at the stadium for any competitive match was set on 4 November 2008 for a Conference League Cup match against Kidderminster Harriers, which attracted a mere 554 people. Transport : Car parking is available adjacent to the ground with spaces available for 400 vehicles, with space for further vehicles available at the Rykneld Trading Estate on Derby Road. On 22 October 2005 the club introduced a £2 parking charge for fans using the car park on matchdays, having previously withheld from charging fans at Eton Park. The club was forced to appease residents of nearby Stretton by allocating no-parking zones on surrounding roads around the ground following congestion concerns as a result of roadside parking. Burton-on-Trent railway station is served by local services operated by CrossCountry towards Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham, with further connections available, however it is located over a mile and a half away from the stadium. Arriva Midlands and Trent Barton operates bus services from the stadium towards the town centre and also towards Derby. The future Since the stadium's construction stages, plans have existed for further facilities to be built as part of the stadium complex. These include plans for a pub and 40-room hotel development in undeveloped land adjacent to the club's car park, as well as a bowls green and pavilion. Whilst the club have obtained planning permission for these projects, the spiralling costs of construction of the stadium has led to the projects being shelved. The training pitch on the complex that had been submitted as part of planning proposals, originally intended to be used for club training and community purposes, has also not yet been built, due to ongoing developments at the St. George's Park complex in Rangemore allowing the Brewers to use it as their current training ground for the foreseeable future.

Depending on the manufacturer and model, these instruments bear varying degrees of resemblance to the traditional sitar. Most resemble the electric guitar in the style of the body and headstock, though some have a body shaped to resemble that of the sitar (such as a model made by Danelectro). History The instrument was developed in the late 1960s by session guitarist Vinnie Bell in partnership with Danelectro. At the time, many western musical groups began to use the sitar, which is generally considered a difficult instrument to learn. By contrast, the electric sitar, with its standard guitar fretboard and tuning, is a more familiar fret arrangement for a guitarist to play. The twangy sitar-like tone comes from a flat bridge adding the necessary buzz to the guitar strings. Configuration In addition to the six playing strings, most electric sitars have sympathetic strings, typically located on the left side of the instrument (though some do not have these). These strings have their own pickups (typically lipstick pickups are used for both sets of strings), and are usually tuned with a harp wrench (a difficult process). A unique type of bridge, a \\"buzz bridge\\", developed by Vinnie Bell, helps give the instrument its distinctive sound. Some electric sitars have drone strings in lieu of sympathetic strings. A few models, such as the Jerry Jones \\"Baby\\" sitar, lack both sympathetic and drone strings, while still retaining the distinctive buzz bridge. The \\"sympathetic\\" strings on most electric sitars do not resonate strongly enough to match the effect of an acoustic sitar. There are resonant chambers in the solid-body instruments that have Masonite tops, however it is not enough to excite the 13 strings into true sympathy. The strings are tensioned over two rosewood bridges with fret material as saddles so the sound is more like an autoharp than a sitar. Versions of the electric sitar were also developed mainly in India. These are smaller sized sitars that look like a sitar. These sitars are tuned the same way as the original classical sitar would be tuned. Usage Because the tone quality and playing technique differ significantly from that of the sitar, it is typically used in rock, jazz, and fusion styles. Notable early hit singles featuring electric sitar include Eric Burdon and the Animals' \\"Monterey\\", Joe South's \\"Games People Play\\", Stevie Wonder's \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\" (played by Eddie Willis) and \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\\", B.J. Thomas' \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" (played by Reggie Young), The Spinners' \\"It's a Shame\\", The Box Tops \\"Cry Like a Baby\\" as well as some sides by The Stylistics and The Delfonics. Other recording artists who have featured the electric sitar include: Elvis Presley \\" 1969 America Sound recording sessions\\" \\"Stranger In My Hometown\\", \\"You'll Think Of Me\\" * Steppenwolf (\\"Snowblind Friend\\", played by producer Richard Podolor) * Mandrake Memorial * Kronos Quartet * Genesis (in \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\", \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\") * Yes (in \\"Close To The Edge\\", \\"Siberian Khatru\\", \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", \\"To Be Over\\") and their guitarist Steve Howe on his solo albums * Mike Oldfield used it on \\"Flying Start\\" (on Islands) * The Clash (in \\"Armagideon Time\\") * Todd Rundgren * Redbone (\\"Come and Get Your Love\\") * Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods (\\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\") * The Grass Roots \\"Glory Bound\\" * Guns N' Roses (in \\"Pretty Tied Up\\") * Lenny Kravitz (\\"It Ain't Over 'til It's Over\\") * Robbie Dupree (\\"Steal Away\\") * Oasis * Dinosaur Jr. (in \\"The Wagon\\") * R.E.M. * Metallica (in \\"Wherever I May Roam\\") * Steely Dan (in \\"Do It Again\\") * Paul Young (in \\"Everytime You Go Away\\") * Tom Petty (in \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\") * Dan Fogelberg (in \\"Nexus\\") * George Duke and Stanley Clarke in (\\"Sweet Baby\\") * Santana * Roy Wood * Eric Johnson * Mystical Sun * Pearl Jam (in \\"Who You Are\\") * Screaming Trees in \\"Halo of Ashes\\" * Redd Kross (in \\"Play My Song\\") * Alice in Chains (in \\"What the Hell Have I\\") * Ugly Kid Joe (in \\"Cats in the Cradle\\") * Torsten de Winkel * Flower Travellin' Band * Prince * The Cure * Manic Street Preachers (in \\"Tsunami\\" and \\"I'm Not Working\\") * Hiroshi Takano * Miyavi * Sugizo * hide * Clarence White * Ronnie Wood * Kaoru of Dir en grey * Pat Metheny (notably on \\"Last Train Home\\") * Sigh * Steve Vai (notably on \\"For the Love of God\\") * Rory Gallagher (in \\"Philby\\") * Mint Royale * Steve Miller * Eddie Van Halen (on \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\" & \\"Primary\\") * Tony Hicks of The Hollies * Schizo Da Maddcap * Rob Mastrianni (Beatbox Guitar, Next Tribe). * Raagnagrok is a contemporary duo using electric sitar and electronic. * Khalil Balakrishna, when playing live for Miles Davis. Although George Harrison is generally credited with introducing the sitar into popular music, he is not known to have played a bona fide electric version on any recording. On his award- winning 1969 instrumental rendition of the Joe South tune \\"Games People Play\\" saxophonist King Curtis teamed with guitarist Duane Allman on the electric sitar (he also played slide guitar). This can be found on the Duane Allman album An Anthology. The 1971 album Somethin' Else recorded by Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass prominently featured an electric sitar, a first for the country music industry. The instrument provided accompaniment on such songs as \\"Snowbird\\", \\"Rose Garden\\", \\"Are You from Dixie?\\" and others. On ABBA’s 1979 recording of \\"I Have A Dream\\" the refrain is played on an electric sitar. However the recording for the 2008 movie version of \\"Mamma Mia\\" featured a real bouzouki.http://www.abbaomnibus.net/ask/qa_apr09.htm The 1992 album Bloody Kisses by Type O Negative used an electric sitar in the song \\"Can't Lose You\\" played by Paul Bento from the band Carnivore. Glass Hammer guitarist Kamran Alan Shikoh performed electric sitar in the band's song from 2009 to his departure in 2018. In 2010, MGMT released their album Congratulations, where the electric sitar was played on many tracks by lead singer and guitarist Andrew VanWyngarden. Blues musician Buddy Guy played, among other guitars, a Coral electric sitar in shows on his 2010 tour. The 2014 album Black Messiah by American neo-soul singer D'Angelo and backing band The Vanguard, features use of the electric sitar on tracks such as \\"Another Life\\" and \\"The Charade\\". The 2015 song \\"Multi-Love\\" by Unknown Mortal Orchestra makes use of the electric sitar.

It was also home to several military forts and to the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station, and was the site of the attacks on and . History Fort George plaque on Goat Island Narragansett Indians called the island \\"Nante Sinunk\\" and sold it in 1658. Early Newport colonists used the island as a goat pasture.Denlson, Frederic; Redi, J. A.; and Reid, R. A.; Narransett Sea and Shore, Providence, RI, 1879; and Seavey, George L.; Rhode Island's Coastal Natural Areas (accessed Oct. 12, 2009) An earthen fort was built on Goat Island in 1703 during the War of Spanish Succession, and it was named \\"Fort Anne\\" after the reigning Queen Anne. On Friday, 19 July 1723, twenty-six pirates were buried on the north end of Goat Island, on the shore, between high and low water mark. The significance of this placement is that, to Christians of this era, this inter- tidal land was considered \\"unhallowed ground,\\" like burials placed outside of a consecrated cemetery. The men had been tried in Newport between 10 and 12 July and hanged at nearby Bull's Point (Gravelly Point). They were: Charles Harris, Thomas Linicar, Daniel Hyde, Stephen Mundon, Abraham Lacy, Edward Lawson, John Tomkins, Francis Laughton, John Fisgerald, William Studfield, Owen Rice, William Read, John Bright, Thomas Hazel, William Blades (Rhode Island), Thomas Hagget, Peter Cues, William Jones, Edward Eaton, John Brown, James Sprinkly, Joseph Sound, Charles Church, John Waters, Thomas Powell (Connecticut), and Joseph Libbey. \\"The pirates were all young men, most of them natives of England.\\"Olden Times Series 5 The following is taken from The Salem Observer, November 11, 1843: \\"...this was the most extensive execution of pirates that ever took place at one time in the Colonies, it was attended by a vast multitude from every part of New England.\\"Also refer to Gutenberg Library, The Olden Times Series, Volume 5, by Henry M. Brooks. In 1738, a stone fort was built and renamed Fort George after King George II.Goat Island Military History In 1764, Newporters took over Fort George and fired shots at , a British ship with a crew that had allegedly stolen from local merchants.Terry Golway, Washington's general: Nathanael Greene and the triumph of the American Revolution John MacRae Books (Macmillan, 2005), p. 25 In 1769, Rhode Islanders burned the customs ship when it drifted to the north end of Goat Island (near where the pirates were buried) in another early act of rebellion against British rule. In September 2018 maritime archaeologists reported that they had discovered the resting place of Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour just off the coast of Goat Island, where it had been used to blockade the British during the US Revolutionary War. The ship and its crew had been made famous as the first European explorers to visit Australia's east coast.Solving One of the Greatest Ever Maritime Mysteries, accessed 19 Sept 2018. Revolutionary War In 1775, the Fort was renamed Fort Liberty. The British army occupied Newport from 1776 through 1779 and renamed it Fort George during that time. Post Revolution In 1784 it was repaired and renamed Fort Washington after George Washington. In 1794, Newport sold Goat Island to the federal government for $1,500 to maintain a military fort to defend Newport Harbor. The fort was named Fort Wolcott in commemoration the services of Oliver Wolcott who was a General of the Militia and a member of the Continental Congress from Connecticut. In 1824, the first Newport Harbor Lighthouse was constructed at the north end of the island. Fort Wolcott was active until 1835 when the garrison was transferred to Florida to fight the Seminole Indians. In 1851 the original lighthouse moved to Prudence Island to become Prudence Island Light, and the current Newport Harbor Light was constructed on a dike near the former lighthouse site. The area surrounding the dike was later filled in when the hotel was constructed much later. Naval Torpedo Station C. 1900, picture of U.S. Torpedo Station on Goat Island In 1869 the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station was founded on Goat Island, on the site of the former Army fort. The Station was greatly expanded over the next 100 years and produced many of the Navy's torpedoes through World War I and World War II at the island's Navy Torpedo Factory. One of the Navy's first radio stations was established on the island in 1903. The torpedo station was closed in 1951 and Naval Undersea Warfare Center was created with a facility nearby. Coast Guard In addition to the Goat Island lighthouse, the Coast Guard has maintained a cutter at Goat Island since at least the late 1960s. The Point-class cutter served her entire 31-year career at Goat Island from when she was commissioned on 14 April 1967 until she was decommissioned on 3 April 1998. The tradition of having a Coast Guard cutter stationed at Goat Island resumed when the Marine Protector-class coastal patrol boat was commissioned on 16 July 2005. Redevelopment In the 1960s, Goat Island was sold to a private developer, Globe Manufacturing. Over the next several decades, Globe constructed the Colonial Hilton Hotel (later known as the Sheraton Islander Inn, Islander Doubletree Hotel, the Hyatt Regency, and, as of late, Gurney's Newport) and Goat Island South Condominiums, and converted the only former navy building remaining on the island into the Goat Island Marina and Marina Bar & Grille. In the 1990s Island Development Corp. (IDC) constructed the \\"Regatta Club\\", an event venue.

History  The game was invented by four drinkers in Ye Olde Royal Oak Inn in Wetton, Staffordshire in 1974, who were bemoaning the fact that the United Kingdom struggled to produce any world champions. Logically, if a new sport was invented that no one else knew about, the country could boast a champion at last. Having tried \\"ear wrestling\\" and \\"push of war\\" (with a scaffolding pole), Pete Cheetham, Eddie Stansfield, Pete Dean and Mick Dawson created toe wrestling. A rule board was produced by the sign writers at the Yorkshire Evening Post. (Mick's girlfriend, Angie Edward, had a father who was the editor.) A small trophy was made and engraved. Mick became the first world champion, retaining the title the next year in 1975; however, in 1976, a Canadian visitor competed and won. The point of the sport being gone, the event was discontinued for a long period. Now the sport is gaining popularity, and although the Olympic committee refused to acknowledge it, the World Toe Wrestling Championship is held annually at back at its birthplace The Royal Oak in Wetton near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, England. Top players include Clive ‘Doctoe’ De silva, Ben ‘Toetal Destruction’ Woodroffe and Alan \\"Nasty\\" Nash, who is the current world champion. Lisa ‘Twinkle Toes’ Shenton is the current women’s world champion and Dolly Millward is the Kids world champion. In 2018 Alan Nash and Ben Woodroffe brought the rights to Toe Wrestling, looking to widen the sport. Events take place in Pakistan, India and China.  Rules  Toe wrestling is similar to arm wrestling. To play, players must take off their shoes and socks as the game is played with bare feet. It is common courtesy for each player to remove the other player's shoes and socks. Players must link toes and each player's foot must touch flat on the other person's foot. The opponents proceed to attempt to pin (capture or trap) the other's foot for three seconds while avoiding the same. There are 3 rounds played on a best 2 out of 3 basis. Rounds are played first with the right foot, then left, and right again if necessary.

A 1934 document recalling the 1870s notes the \\"Puckapunyal tribe, and there were about twenty in number. … I knew four of them fairly well, one of whom was called Billy Hamilton (and claimed to be the son of the Chief of the Puckapunyal tribe) his lubra, Mary, Gelibrand and Lankey.\\"https://becker-zwar.com/john-william-walter-zwar-e4/ Family history site, open access The first European occupier of the townsite of Broadford was Lt. Col. Henry White who was reported as being \\"of Mount Piper\\" in October 1838.Lieutenant Colonel White, of Mount Piper, Port Phillip Gazette, 27 October 1838, p. 3. Mount Piper is 4 km west of Broadford. White was the first recorded land holder in the vicinity. The first survey map of the region in 1842 shows Colonel White’s Station on Sunday Creek only 4 km downstream of its junction with Dry Creek.Nutt, Thomas, H.

That junction became the future townsite of Broadford. This map also shows Gideon Stewart’s sheep station exactly on the future Broadford townsite, 9 chains (181 metres) East of the junction of Dry Creek with Sunday Creek. Stewart arrived from Hobart and took out a licence for a sheep station from 1 July 1840.Persons Licensed to Depasture Stock, Port Phillip Gazette, 29 July 1840, p. 4. Stewart was an associate of the well known Hobart publican Reay Clarke.Address to Alfred Stephen, Esq., Tasmanian, 3 May 1839, p.5. Clarke left Hobart and set up an inn at the location of Stewart’s sheep station in 1843. The location was referred to as \\"Clarke’s Ford\\" in October, 1843.Melbourne Times, 10 October 1843, p. 3 Clarke was granted a General Licence for the \\"Broadfoot\\" Inn, Sunday Creek on 27 April 1844.Port Phillip Gazette, 27 April 1844, p. 2 By April 1845 it was recorded as \\"Broadford\\" Inn.Port Phillip Gazette, 16 April 1845, p. 2 In 1842, the Sunday Creek Inn (named after a nearby stream where the explorers Hume and Hovell camped one Sunday) and Stockyard Inn were built to cater for passing trade. Blacksmiths and small stores soon appeared and the town was gazetted in 1854 with original allotments selling at £2 a piece. The area between the two inns became the focal point of business and leisure activities. An area traditionally connected with Broadford has been Sugarloaf Creek, Victoria. The Sugarloaf Creek Station near Broadford was the first inland settlement in Victoria when it was set up by Charles Ebden and Charles Bonney on about 14 March 1837.Williams, Martin, Charles Bonney and the fertile Kilmore Plains, Victorian Historical Journal, Volume 90, No. 1, June 2019, p. 107 Gold was discovered in 1858 in the nearby Reedy Creek, and later at Strath Creek and Sunday CreekFletcher, B.

The town's substantial reserves of fine white kaolin clay are used both as a medical absorbent and for the manufacture of pottery.It has a primary school, a secondary college and two kindergartens. Broadford is also home to the Victorian State Motorcycle Complex, which has both road and off-road tracks, and hosts National riding events, as well as amateur track days. In 2014 Calibre Sports Inc. leased some land on the complex and in 2015 the complex hosted the Tough Mudder Australia event.

It is currently used for football matches and is the home ground of Bath City. From 1986 to 1996 Bristol Rovers played there following their departure from Eastville. The stadium has a capacity of 3,528 people, with 1,066 seats. History The ground was opened on 26 June 1909 as Innox Park on land that had been donated by Thomas Carr. The opening ceremony involved a parade of scholars, the singing of hymns and a speech by the chairman of the parish council.Byrne, Stephen & Jay, Mike (2003): Bristol Rovers Football Club, The Definitive History 1883-2003. Twerton Park became Bath City's ground in 1932. A record attendance of 18,020 was recorded in 1960 versus Brighton & Hove Albion. The ground has also hosted Team Bath, who were a full-time professional team playing in the Conference South until their resignation at the end of the 2008–09 season. At the end of the 2011–12 season the club offered the naming rights to Twerton Park for just £50. The offer drew 167 entries from as far afield as the US, Australia, Norway and Singapore which raised £3,850 for the club. Businesses made up 58 of the entries with only a handful of the remaining personalised entries being deemed unsuitable. The winning entry drawn at random was The Mayday Trust, a charitable organisation that helps to rehome vulnerable people. Talks have been held in the past between Bath Rugby and Bath City about sharing a ground, as the former team wish to move away from their home ground Recreation Ground, although nothing has amounted from this. Following the resignation of Chairman Manda Rigby, she claimed that the club needed to move away from Twerton Park to \\"sustain their finances\\". Redevelopment Twerton park is currently being prepared for redevelopment, with the club in discussions with private investment company Greenacre Capital who wish to build purpose built student accommodation on the adjoining land. The agreement is for Bath City to give up part of their land to Greenacre, in exchange for the latter to build the club a new grandstand and facilities, which will include affordable housing, a sports bar, gym, offices and community space. The club also plan to convert the playing surface to 3G.

It has been the home ground of Stevenage (formerly Stevenage Borough and Stevenage Town) since the early 1960s, and has a capacity of 7,800 people. History The club plays at Broadhall Way, previously home to Stevenage Town and Stevenage Athletic. Following the bankruptcy of the town's former club, the stadium was not used for three years. The newly formed Stevenage Borough had planned on playing Hitchin Town Youth at Broadhall Way in November 1976 as a \\"curtain-raiser\\" for the new venture. Volunteers prepared the pitch in anticipation, but their plans were scuppered when the ex-chairman of Stevenage Athletic -- and stadium lease-holder -- desecrated the playing surface at Broadhall Way by digging a trench across the full length of the pitch. The club eventually moved into Broadhall Way in 1980 as a result of the council re-purchasing the stadium, and allowed the football club to become its tenant. Following Stevenage's successful 1995-96 Conference campaign, the Hertfordshire side were denied promotion to the Football League because of insufficient ground capacity and facilities. Consequently, in the early 2000s, the ground was upgraded, with a new £600,000 stand opening, and work on a £5million training facility was announced for nearby Shephalbury Park -- which subsequently opened in Autumn 2002. In June 2011, the club secured a 40-acre former sports ground in Bragbury End -- with the intention of developing the site into a new training complex. Work began on the development in the summer of 2011, and the staff began to use the complex towards the latter stages of the 2012-13 season. In January 2009, Stevenage announced that they had signed a seven-figure sponsorship deal with the Lamex Food Group, resulting in the renaming of Broadhall Way to the Lamex Stadium. As a result of the club securing promotion as league champions during the club's 2009-10 campaign, Broadhall Way hosted League football for the first time during the 2010-11 season. The stadium has a capacity of 6,722 people, including 3,142 seats. The capacity was reduced from 7,100 following the club's promotion to the Football League. Structure and facilities The ground's pitch includes four stands – the East Terrace, the North Stand, the West Stand, and South Stand. The West Stand is all-seated and covered, and covers the length of the pitch, although it has open corners to either side of the stand. At the back of the stand there are a number of glass-fronted areas to various club offices and executive boxes. The club shop is situated next to the West Stand, opposite to the club's official car-park. Opposite to the West Stand is the East Terrace, which is a covered terrace for home supporters. The terrace has a gable with a clock sitting on its roof above the half-way line, as well as holding a television gantry on its roof. The North Terrace was situated behind the goal at the north end of the ground and was just seven steps deep. Three-quarters of the terrace was covered, whilst one-quarter was open and without cover. The stand held a capacity of 700 people, and offered facilities for disabled fans. In January 2013, the club announced they were due to present plans to replace the existing North Terrace with a new £1.2 million 1,700 seat stand, although these did not materialise due to \\"numerous obstacles put in the way\\". In July 2017, the club asked fans to contribute towards a mini-bond investment scheme, through sports investment platform Tifosy, in an attempt to fund the remaining £500,000 needed to go towards developing the new North Stand. The club stated its desire to open the new stand for the start of the 2018-19 season if the bond scheme was successful. Five weeks after the campaign started, the £500,000 target was met after investment from over 200 fans. A further £100,000 was raised in the following days, meaning a total of £600,000 would be invested in the new North Stand development. The North Terrace was demolished in January 2018. Work on the new North Stand was halted in June 2018 when UK Power Networks refused the club permission to construct a stand around the existing substation. Work restarted in February 2019 when the new substation was installed. The 1,428 all-seater stand was officially opened in December 2019. Opposite the North Stand is the South Stand, which is a single tiered, all- seated covered stand. The stand was built in 2001, costing £600,000. The South Stand is reserved for away supporters and can hold a capacity of 1,400. The stand also has an electronic scoreboard in the centre of the roof, which was installed in 2001, making it visible to home supporters. The scoreboard was replaced in October 2011. Behind the stand is the supporters' club. A new set of floodlights were installed before the start of the club's 2007–08 campaign. Other uses The stadium hosted the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, in January 2003, for a friendly against an Italy XI outfit. The stadium was also used for an England U20 match against Czech Republic U20 in October 2003. The game ended 2-0 to England. In July 2012, the stadium hosted a warm-up friendly between Senegal U23 and South Korea U23, ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, with South Korea winning the match 3-0. Additionally, for five years, the ground hosted the Tottenham Hotspur reserve side, with the North London club opting to use Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road for the start of the 2007-08 season due to its more convenient geographical location. Since September 2014, the stadium has once again hosted a number of Tottenham U21 league and cup fixtures each season. At the end of the 2005-06 season, Broadhall Way also hosted the Conference South play-off final between St Albans City and Histon; a match that St Albans won 2-0 in front of 3,284 spectators. The following year, the stadium played host to the play-off final once again, where 3,167 were in attendance to watch Salisbury City beat Braintree Town 1-0 to gain promotion to the Conference Premier. It hosted the final for the third, and last time, in May 2008 when Eastbourne Borough beat Hampton & Richmond Borough 2-0. Moreover, various charity based matches have also taken place at the ground in recent years. The stadium hosted its first boxing event on 18 May 2019 when Billy Joe Saunders defeated Shefat Isufi to win the WBO super-middleweight title. Records Stevenage's average league attendances at Broadhall Way from 1994 to 2009. The highest attendance recorded at the stadium was 8,040 for a match against Newcastle United in the FA Cup fourth-round on 25 January 1998. A temporary stand was erected behind the away end to increase the stadium capacity to 8,100, enough to satisfy the FA. The highest attendance recorded for a competitive league match at Broadhall Way is 7,024, when Stevenage played Luton Town in the Conference Premier in April 2010, previously beating the 6,520 attendance when Stevenage played Hereford United in the Conference National play-offs in May 2005. The club's lowest attendance whilst playing in the highest tier of non-league football is 879 for a match against Stalybridge Celtic in March 1995. The lowest attendance recorded at the ground for a first-team match is 152 for an Isthmian League match against Billericay Town in August 1987. The highest seasonal average for Stevenage at Broadhall Way since the club was promoted to the Football Conference in 1994 is 2,748, during the club's 1996-97 campaign. This seasonal average was beaten when the club were promoted into the Football League for the 2010-11 season, averaging 2,960 fans during their first ever season as a Football League team. Attendances continued to improve the following season, in the club's first League One campaign, with the seasonal average sitting at 3,559, the first time the club had averaged over 3,000 spectators. The season was also the first time that over 100,000 fans attended games at Broadhall Way. This figure showed a significant rise in the club's attendances, as it was over double the number of fans who attended games at the stadium during the 2008-09 season. The lowest overall average attendance while the club has been in the top fiver tiers of English football was in the side's first year in the Conference, in 1994-95, averaging 1,415. Transport : The ground is located just over a mile away from Stevenage railway station, which is adjacent to the town centre, the station lies on the East Coast Main Line north of King's Cross station.

Its stadium is known as El Malecon. The Cave of Altamira, famed for the prehistoric paintings found inside, is about 10 kilometers northwest of the city. History Torrelavega was founded at the end of the thirteenth century by Garci Lasso de la Vega I (the elder), Adelantado Mayor of the Kingdom of Castile in the name of King Alfonso XI of Castile. Its current name is due to the contraction of the original eponym of \\"Torre de la Vega\\". The Castle or Tower of the Vega's was built by Leonor Lasso de la Vega, daughter of Garci Lasso de la Vega II, the younger, and mother of the Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana in order to administer the tax and privilege due in the family's territory.

He is a world-renowned social anthropologist, most famous for his works in the Southwest involving the Hopi Indians and many of the social changes that take place within the Western Pueblos. Ernest L. Schusky claims Fred Eggan is a founder of modern American anthropoly's eclectic approach, which combines the functionalism of Radcliffe-Brown with the historical approach of Franz Boas. In a paper titled “Among the Anthropologist,” Eggan answers a question posed by Margaret Mead: “Shouldn’t we all be branches of one human science?” Eggan states that anthropology should center on man and his works, while providing a spectrum of specialized fields which interlock with those of the social and behavioral sciences. Background Frederick Eggan was born in Seattle, Washington on September 12, 1906 to Alfred Eggan and Olive Smith. Eggan earned his master's degree in psychology with a minor in anthropology from the University of Chicago in the early 20th century. He received his PhD in anthropology from the same university several years later with a doctoral thesis entitled “Social Organization of the Western Pueblos” analyzing the social organization of Pueblo Indians in the Southwest. Fred was an active member in the discipline of anthropology at a critical time when new technologies and methods were being invented for archeological purposes. He mentions these innovations in his paper on “Social Anthropology and the Method of Controlled Comparison.” He speaks of the new aids to anthropological research such as radiocarbon dating, genetics, and the experimental method which are just a few of the many rapid technological advances that had taken place to aid the discipline in this time. Eggan married Dorothy Way in 1938; she was also an anthropologist of the Hopi. Fred died in his house in Santa Fe, New Mexico from heart failure on May 7, 1991; he was 84. Employment history Fred Eggan served as chairman at the University of Chicago of the department of anthropology; he was also president of the American Anthropological Association. He was also employed as a professor of psychology, sociology, and history at Wentworth Junior College and Military Academy in Missouri before he obtained his PhD. Eggan also worked as a research assistant to Radcliffe-Brown at the University of Chicago, researching the social organization of Native American tribes. During his time teaching at the University of Chicago, Frederick held several positions. He was employed as an assistant professor (1940–1942), an associate professor (1942–1948), and professor (1948–1963). Fred retired from teaching in 1974. He addressed the connection between anthropology and the educational system in the following terms “Anthropology and education should have close working relations. Educators are occupied by the task of keeping the operations going, particularly in this period of changing models, and have little time or opportunity to step outside their educational institutions and them as a system in the society as a whole. He was also the director of the Philippine Studies Program at the University of Chicago. Eggan also held a prominent position for the Philippine government during World War II as chief of research. Awards and honors Frederick Eggan was president of the American Anthropological Association from 1953 to 1954. He was also awarded the Weatherhead Resident Scholar in 1979 by the School for Advanced Research for his work entitled “The Great Basic Background of Hopi Culture History. He also received the Viking Fund medal in 1956. Towards the end of Frederick Eggan’s career in the 1960s, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as to the National Academy of Sciences. Key field work Frederick Eggan has participated in several field studies at many different locations. Some of these sites include: Santa Fe where he lived with the Hopi Indians for a summer (1932), Mississippi and Oklahoma where his research was focused on primarily the Choctaw, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians (1933), and the Northern Philippines where he studied social changes in the Ifugao, Bontok, Tinguian, and Ilocano Indians (1934–1935). Research emphasis Eggan’s research has been primarily focused on “Native American kinship and social systems”, making use of archeological, linguistic, and general ethnographic evidence. With his work in North America, Eggan attempted to create a theory to illuminate Boasian empiricism, which was a theory developed by Franz Boas that all knowledge was derived from sense-experience. Eggan's work in Santa Fe analyzed each Western Pueblo social structure and compared and contrasted them to the Eastern Pueblos. His most important contribution to archeology, and possibly anthropology in general, was his demonstrations how the variations currently observed in the Pueblo social structures are related to cultural adaptations to ecological niches. Eggan's time spent studying the Cheyenne and Arapaho served as a basis for one of his most famous works, “Social Anthropology and the Method of Controlled Comparison.” He demonstrated how it was possible for the Cheyenne to change from a predominantly agricultural based lineage type kinship system to a system that was predominantly nomadic involving a heavy dependence on hunting and gathering in bands to increase their efficiency. Eggan theorized from his extensive research that this was a result of being forced by other tribes onto the Plains out of their land, which was in present-day Minnesota. The result of Eggan's work in the Philippines can be found in his paper on “Cultural Drift and Social Change.” It is in this paper that he claims as one travels from the interior down to the coast, there are patterned series of changes in a definite direction in many important cultural institutions such as social, political, economic, and religious.

Location The ground is situated in Blowick, which is just inside the east boundary of Southport near the A570, the main road from Southport to Ormskirk and the M58 motorway. It is sited at the edge of a residential area, adjoining school playing fields. Stadium Haig Avenue now has a capacity of 6,008 but its record attendance is 20,010 for two matches played by Southport against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1932 and against Everton in a 1968 FA Cup tie. Since Southport lost Football League status in 1978, the ground has seldom operated at more than a quarter full, although nearly full houses were registered for key matches such as the 1998 F.A. Trophy semi-final against Slough Town, which Southport won to reach their first ever Wembley final, and their 2010 FA Cup third round home tie against Sheffield Wednesday. The ground has a covered main stand on the north side of the ground (the entrance to it is from Haig Avenue, the road) called \\"the Grandstand\\". This is opposite an uncovered terrace on the south side, known as \\"the Popular Side\\". Behind the goals, the west (Scarisbrick) end is covered and this is where the majority of the home fans congregate. The west stand is called the \\"Jack Carr Stand\\", after a popular director at the club, and was named shortly after his death. The east (Blowick) end, used mainly by away team supporters, is open to the elements. The north and west sides of the ground back onto residential property and the uncovered south and east sides onto the playing fields of the nearby Meols Cop High School. The Haig Avenue road is a thoroughfare linking Scarisbrick New Road (A570) with Meols Cop Road and Norwood Road. There are limited car parking facilities and these are reserved for home, away and match officials. There is usually ample parking in local streets. History Southport (in yellow) vs Kidderminster Harriers, 2005, with the Jack Carr Stand in the background. Southport F.C. moved to what is now called Haig Avenue in 1905 (then called Ash Lane). The road the ground is situated on and the ground itself were officially renamed Haig Avenue after Earl Haig in 1921. The grandstand that now stands at Haig Avenue was opened in August 1968, 2 years after the original main stand had burnt down. The wooden structure, which had been purchased from the Southport Flower Show burnt down the day after a game against Wrexham on Boxing Day in 1966 (a game which Southport won 1-0). Most of the clubs possessions including kits, went up in flames with only the club safe (holding the previous day's takings) surviving. A temporary main stand was put up instead during the season Billy Bingham's side won promotion to the third division. Eric Morecambe presented the club with a trophy to commemorate their achievement. In 1973, following his first Grand National victory, Red Rum was presented to the crowd at half time during a match against Lincoln City. Today there is open terracing at the 'Blowick' away end and on the 'Popular' side opposite the Main Stand. Covered terracing for about 10,000 spectators on the Popular side and Scarisbrick end was demolished following legal action against the football club by Sefton Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds legislation. However, on 10 September 2012, it was announced that Merseyrail had agreed a sponsorship deal that would see Haig Avenue renamed the \\"Merseyrail Community Stadium\\". After years of procrastination, the club said that in the summer of 2014, with the financial assistance of 'Trust in Yellow' (the Supporters' Trust), County Insurance and a grant from the football authorities, it would erect new corner floodlights to replace those erected along the sides of the pitch over 40 years ago. While some preparatory work on the project started in May/June 2014, just within the deadline set in the town planning conditions, the club has since revised the completion date to November 2014. Everton Reserves currently play their home games at the stadium. On 4 August 2019, it was announced that the stadium would now be known as The Pure Stadium after Pure Business Group offered a 3 year naming deal. Events The ground has played host to youth internationals in the past, and has also been home to both Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C. reserves. It has also numerous hosted FA Women's Cup ties. Everton Ladies played the first half of the 2018-19 season at the ground. For the coronation in 1937, an estimated attendance of 15,000 packed into the ground for the celebrations.

Serving in the Siachen region of the disputed territory of Kashmir, Abbasi planned and executed assaults on Indian Army posts. Abbasi was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for being party to an attempted coup d'état against the civilian government of Benazir Bhutto in 1995 while he was still a serving major general. No political party was linked to this coup attempt as determined by the courts. Military and intelligence career Abbasi was commissioned into the Baloch Regiment of the Pakistan Army around 1963. As a Captain in the Army, he was appointed the adjutant of Cadet College Petaro in 1966. He served in that position until 1969. In 1972, he married Shahida Zaheer, daughter of A.A. Shaikh, who was the principal at Cadet College Petaro. Abbasi had four children – two sons and two daughters. Abbasi participated in the 1971 war against India on the western front. His overall performance was rated very high and he rose up through the ranks to become a Brigadier general by the mid-1980s. Abbasi remained a part of the military establishment as long as he was in service with no links to any political or religious groups as per the tradition of the army. Abbasi worked as an intelligence and military officer in liaison with Afghan Mujahideen resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1980–1986). In 1987–1988, Brigadier Abbasi also served as the military attaché at the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi, India. On December 1, 1988 New Delhi police arrested Abbasi in a meeting with an alleged Indian contact. As no information or documents could be obtained from him, the Indian government was forced to release him within hours; he was declared persona non grata and expelled from India. Siachen assault In April 1984, the Siachen conflict broken out between India and Pakistan, leading to a war-like situation that has lasted since then. Thousands of Pakistani and Indian soldiers have been killed in high-altitude warfare. As a Brigadier, Abbasi was deployed as a unit commander in the Siachen area in 1991. Abbasi opposed the restraint imposed by the army under prime minister Nawaz Sharif, and planned an assault with a group of army officers. Striving to seize key posts. Abbasi and his allies were removed from their posts by the army chief Gen. Asif Nawaz. Coup attempt Dropped from further promotion in the army command and due to dissatisfaction with the affairs in the country, Major General Abbasi allegedly plotted a coup against the civilian government of prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the army chief Gen. Abdul Waheed Kakar in 1995. At the time of the attempted coup, Abbasi held the post of director-general of Infantry Corps at the Army General Headquarters GHQ – a staff position where he did not command any troops. Attempting to gather a group of senior officers and military commanders, Abbasi was accused of planning to assassinate Bhutto, Kakar, senior cabinet ministers and the military chiefs and proclaim the establishment of Islamic law in Pakistan, and taking over the government. The plot was foiled when it was uncovered by Lt. Gen. Ali Kuli Khan, then Director General Military Intelligence (DGMI). The coup plotters were arrested, and following a court-martial, Abbasi was moved to the civilian central prison at Haripur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.. DAWN / NEWS International, Karachi (23 September 1997) According to one of the earliest reports, \\"Diplomats and politicians in Islamabad tell a different story. They say the arrested officers were not planning a coup, but were supplying arms to separatists fighting in Indian Kashmir. Bhutto, these sources say, was responding to pressure from Washington to crack down on military support to the rebels in violation of official policy.

With one of the co-conspirators Qari Saifullah turning an \\"approver\\" (government witness), the military court determined that Abbasi was not the main plotter in the attempted coup and was therefore given a lighter sentence of only 7 years as compared to the other army officers like Brigadier Mustansir BiLLAH who were convicted for terms up to 14 years. The coup was not considered serious enough to grant a death sentence to any of the plotters. Qari Saifullah was not convicted as a part of the deal with the government for his becoming a witness. Release Abbasi's imprisonment started in 1995 and he was to remain in prison for 7 years, i.e. until 2002. During his period of imprisonment, Abbasi lodged an appeal to Supreme Court of Pakistan in 1997 for a review of his case. With his military career over, Abbasi moved to organise a political party with the aim of creating awareness and establishing the rule of Islamic law through constitutional change. Abbasi formed another political party called the Azmat-e-Islam party with the same objectives.

The program's recent stated goal has been to instill in U.S. citizens an active sense of ownership and responsibility for natural, cultural, and historic resources. The program has been pursued since 1985 with varying levels of commitment, depending on funding levels and the commitment of the Department of the Interior under different federal administrations. As of 2015, though the Take Pride in America Act is still used as the legal basis for certain Department of the Interior programs, the program is not being promoted. Description The program's primary activity in recent times has been to provide volunteer opportunities nationwide, including spending the summer as a tour guide at a national park or working on a wildlife habitat restoration project. Projects can also be created in local communities. Origins In 1985 United States Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel identified a growing problem with vandalism and looting of historical artifacts on public lands and developed Take Pride in America to promote the need to take care of public lands. Convervation groups had previously criticized Hodel and the Reagan Administration for prioritizing the exploitation of Federal lands for mining and energy extraction rather than for wildlife and recreation. Hodel's vision for Take Pride in America was also criticized for being a substitute for appropriate federal spending on public lands and outdoor recreation. The George Wright Forum, the publication of the George Wright Society, criticized the Bush administration for using Take Pride in America to replace full-time National Park Service staff with unpaid volunteers. The Federal Take Pride in America programs were defunded in the early 1990s, but the Take Pride in America Act (Title XI of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Public Law 101-628, November 28, 1990), , remained unrepealed. In 1997, President Clinton called for an increase in volunteer service in the U.S. but no funds were allocated specifically for service on public lands. Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton re-launched Take Pride in America in April 2003 under the USA Freedom Corps, a council for service opportunities. Office of the Secretary, Department of the Interior series. \\"Take Pride in America Files\\". October 17th, 2006. Take Pride in America Enhancing Public Lands Through Volunteerism. New Jersey Clean Communities. As with the Reagan Administration, the George W. Bush Administration and Secretary Norton were being criticized for expanding the exploitation of Federal lands for mining and energy. The Boy Scouts of America had been involved in the Take Pride in America program since the mid-1980s. While the TPIA program was in abeyance in the 1990s, the BSA developed their Service to America program, with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000; Service to America provided service projects in conjunction with the National Park Service and the program was rolled into the relaunch of Take Pride in America to give the relaunch an immediate pool of volunteers. Take Pride Events Take Pride has organized volunteer tours and other events under the \\"Take Pride in America\\" title. Marti Allbright, Gail Norton, and Clint Eastwood celebrate with Carmel River School students as the school was designated the first Take Pride in America school. The Take Pride Schools program was launched in the fall of 2005 to introduce schoolchildren to volunteerism and to stimulate interest in and stewardship of America's public lands. To be designated as a Take Pride School, a school must commit to participating in two Take Pride volunteer events each year that benefit public lands. Participation can be by an entire school, a class, or even an after- school club. Projects must be on public lands (which can include public school properties), promote Take Pride's message, and benefit public use of public land. Awards Take Pride in America has given different awards to recognize outstanding volunteer efforts of the individuals and groups within the framework of Take Pride in America. No awards have been announced since Sally Jewell took office as Secretary of the Interior in 2013. * National Awards for individuals or groups have been given annually in a ceremony in Washington, D.C. * Hours of Service Awards are given to Individuals. The Secretarial Award is given to those who have donated more than 3,000 hours of service on public lands, and the Presidential Award to those donating more than 4,000 hours. * Special Awards are given by participating elected officials for outstanding volunteer projects and exceptional garden programs that promote the mission of Take Pride.

It has a capacity of 6,078. History The site on Victoria Road has been a football ground since 1917, when it was used by Sterling Athletic, the works team of the adjacent Sterling Telegraph and Electric Company factory. The ground was next used by another works team, Briggs Motor Bodies, later known as Briggs Sports. It was not fully enclosed until the summer of 1955, when Briggs Sports moved out to Rush Green Road, and Dagenham F.C. moved there from the Dagenham Arena. During that summer they levelled and re-seeded the pitch, removed the stones from the playing surface and extended the banking and the terracing. The only cover was a tiny wooden stand, which was steep and narrow and had a few rows of seating on the far side of the ground. The main stand was built in the autumn of 1955 and was opened on 7 January 1956 by J.W. Bowers, chairman of the Essex County Football Association. During the summer of 1956 the turnstile block at the Victoria Road side of the ground and the men's toilets situated at the Victoria Road were added. In the summer of 1958 the cover over the far side was erected at a cost of £1,400. The first floodlit match at Victoria Road was Dagenham v Woodford Town in the FA Youth Cup on 26 September 1957 and the first senior match was a friendly against Rainham Town on 19 March 1958. The attendance record was set in 1967 with the visit of Reading in the FA Cup when 7,200 crammed into the ground. Although the ground was regularly maintained, it changed little until the arrival of Redbridge Forest in 1990 to ground share. They paid for a new stand to be erected in the corner of the ground to increase the seating capacity and replaced the grass banking with concrete terracing. These improvements brought the ground up to the standard required by the Football Conference. Redbridge Forest and Dagenham merged in July 1992 to become Dagenham & Redbridge and the ground improvements have continued right up to the present day. In 1995 they replaced the crumbling pitch perimeter wall with a new brick-built one and two years later rebuilt the toilet block at the Victoria Road end of the ground. The club brought in Bill O'Neil from Atcost to design and build a new purpose-built stand. The new 800-seater, which brings the seating capacity to over one thousand, was used for the first time for the Essex Senior Cup final against Canvey Island on 4 August 2001, twelve weeks after the old stand was last used. During summer 2001 new turnstile blocks were constructed and the eight floodlights were replaced with four corner ones. In October 2001, Bass Brewery agreed a £150,000 sponsorship of the new stand, now named the Carling Stand. This provided the funds for the improvements to continue and a number of crush barriers were installed in 2002, which helped ease the flow of spectators around the ground along with a new walkway behind the covered terrace. Whilst the Dagenham & Redbridge record attendance is 5,949, set against Ipswich Town in January 2002, these improvements have enabled the ground to meet Football League status and the capacity is now 6,078. In July 2007 a new sponsorship deal was set up with the Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council with the stadium renamed the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham Stadium.Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council - Daggers' Celebrate New Sponsorship Deal with Council. Retrieved 15 March 2008. The Traditional Builders & Contractors Ltd Stand at the west end of the ground (Pondfield Road end) was built during the close season of 2009; it has a capacity of 1,240 and is all seated. Access to the away stand is via gates at the far end of the ground from the entrance via Victoria Road. The stand has disabled facilities, and also incorporates a bar, snack bar, and new club office and changing facilities. The players now emerge onto the pitch from a tunnel in the stand (left) rather than the old tunnel in the middle of the Carling Stand. The floodlights were replaced in the summer of 2012, bringing the stadium fully up to the new Football League regulations with regards to floodlighting. Ground use The ground has been used to host some important matches including a Women's Full international match between England and Sweden, an FA Women's Cup semi-final, UEFA Youth International matches involving England, San Marino and Cyprus, various County and League Cup finals and an FAXI against an Isthmian League representative side. Premier League West Ham United also use the ground to host their under-23 fixtures and women's fixtures.

It is home to Tonbridge Angels, who currently compete in the National League South.  History  The Longmead Stadium was built in 1980 by Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council after they had decided to redevelop Tonbridge Angels' Angel Ground in 1977 into a shopping centre. Tonbridge Angels were against the plans to evict them and demolish the Angel Ground and so took out a legal challenge against the plans. Three years later, the High Court ruled in favour of the borough council however, the council offered Tonbridge Angels the Longmead Stadium as replacement compensation after a series of negotiations. One of the stands at the Longmead Stadium was named \\"The Jack Maddams Stand\\" after a former Tonbridge Angels striker who had died. In 2008, the Longmead Stadium hosted a charity match between an Alan Rodgers select XI and an All stars team that was captained by former Tottenham Hotspur player, Gary Stevens as well as Andy Townsend and Jason Cundy. Outside football The Longmead Stadium was also used as the location of a temporary office for the Tunbridge Wells branch of the charity, Headway UK after they were obliged to move from their old location at Pembury Hospital due to redevelopment of the hospital.

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Crawley Town F.C. The stadium has a capacity of 6,134 people, and is owned by Crawley Borough Council. Between 2013 and 2018, the stadium was named the Checkatrade.com Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal. In late 2018, the stadium was renamed “The Peoples Pension Stadium” as part of a new sponsorship deal.  History  Crawley Town FC spent 48 years at their Town Mead home until the land was sold to developers in 1997. The club then moved to the Broadfield Stadium, about two miles across town. In January 2012 the application for the new 2,000-seater East Stand (and facilities including new turnstiles and Premier League standard flood lights) was accepted by Crawley Borough Council. The upgrade is required to meet the league rules which require a minimum 5,000 capacity stadium. After just one week of construction, the new East Stand was completed on 2 April 2012, bringing the total capacity of the Broadfield Stadium to 5,500. Upon completion, Crawley's first game with the new stand was against League Two side Crewe Alexandra on 6 April. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with a new record crowd of 4,723, the previous best being 4,522. The record attendance reached 5,880 on Saturday 5 January 2013 when Crawley Town hosted Reading in the FA Cup. Between 2013 and 2018, the stadium was called The Checkatrade.com Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with the online trades comparison company Checkatrade. Stands West Stand Broadfield Stadium - West stand The West Stand is the main stand, running two thirds of the length of the pitch. It contains club offices, merchandise shop, changing rooms and hospitality. It is raised above pitch level meaning that fans have to climb a small flight of stairs at the front to enter the seated area. Prior to the building of the East Stand, it was the only stand in the stadium to contain seats and a small section at the north end of the stand was available to away supporters. It is now entirely for home support. North and South Stands The North Stand and South Stand are two identical small roofed terraces. The South Stand contains the most vocal home support and the North Stand is allocated to away fans. Both stands curve around the corners of the pitch to meet up with the West Stand. The South Stand has been known as the Structured Communications Stand since December 2015. East Stand The East Stand is an all seated roofed stand with a capacity of 2,154. It is mainly for home fans although some seats at the north end of the stand are available to away supporters. The stand opened for the first time on Good Friday 2012 for the League Two home game against Crewe Alexandra. The stand was planned following promotion to the football league in May 2011, to comply with Football League regulations. Work on the East Stand of the stadium started in early February 2012. It replaced the uncovered East terrace which was a standing area. Between 2013 and 2015 it was known as the Checkatrade.com Stand but was renamed The People's Pension East Stand in December 2015 due to a sponsorship deal with B&CE.; Location The stadium is located in Broadfield, Crawley.

It is still largely in its original form and has a rich variety of trees and planting. It is close to St Albans City railway station. Overview The park was laid out in early 1894, and comprises a municipal sports ground and a public park and pleasure ground. The benefactor, Sir John Maple, the owner of Maple's furniture store in Tottenham Court Road and who lived at nearby Childwickbury, donated the land and paid for the laying out, the planting and the construction of the buildings; the layout of the park itself was designed by the City Surveyor, Mr G. Ford. A striking water fountain, which can still be seen today, was donated by Lady Maple. The park was opened on 23 July 1894 by the Duke of Cambridge, a member of the Royal family, and the event was accompanied by great celebrations in the city of St Albans. The sports ground hosts cricket, hockey, bowls and croquet and is also the home of St Albans City Football Club. The public park includes large grass areas used for sun bathing and games during summer, a bandstand, a children's play-park and a café. The public park is also used as the site of some of the human \\"Peopletown\\" skits on Disney Channel's preschool series Bunnytown.  Football ground  Clarence Park is the home ground of St Albans City FC and it has been since their formation in 1908. It was used by St Albans FC and St Albans Amateurs FC prior to the formation of St Albans City. On 22 September 1894, the first football match at Clarence Park took place. In the 1992-93 season, St Albans City finished as runners-up in the Isthmian League but were denied promotion due a low ground grading as a result of a diseased oak tree within one of the terraces. Cricket ground Next to the football ground is a cricket ground. The first recorded match played on the cricket ground came in 1875, when Hertfordshire played Somerset. The first Minor Counties Championship match played on the ground came in 1895 when Hertfordshire played Bedfordshire. From 1895 to 1997, the ground hosted 84 Minor Counties Championship matches and 2 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches. The cricket ground has played host to two List-A matches, he first of which came in the 1984 NatWest Trophy between Hertfordshire and Somerset. The second and final List-A match played on the ground came in the 1990 NatWest Trophy between Hertfordshire and Warwickshire. The ground also hosted a single match in the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup, which was contested between New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago. In local domestic cricket, the ground is the home of St Albans Cricket Club who play in the Saracens Hertfordshire Cricket League Division 2A.

Thompson preferred a simple two-cylinder design instead of Gresley's three-cylinder one. The seventy K1s were intended to be split between the North Eastern Region of British Railways and the Eastern Region of British Railways. Prototype Prototype K1 No. 61997 'MacCailin Mor' in Doncaster Carr Locomotive Yard 23 April 1961 LNER Class K4 number 3445 MacCailin Mor was rebuilt in 1945 as a two-cylinder prototype of the K1 class, designated K1/1. Thompson entrusted the rebuilding of No.3445 as a two-cylinder Mogul to his principal assistant Arthur Peppercorn. This locomotive became British Railways no. 61997. Production When Peppercorn replaced Thompson as chief mechanical engineer he made the rebuilding the basis for a new class of 2-cylinder 2-6-0. Several modifications were made. The running plates were redesigned to improve access to the cylinder steam chests and there were changes to the leading pony truck, the cylinder linings and the boiler. The new engines were also longer and received bigger tenders holding 4,200 gallons of water instead of the 3,500 gallons of the K4s. An order for 70 of the new mixed traffic 2-6-0s was placed with the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow. They were the last steam locomotives built to an LNER design although all were delivered under British Railways auspices. Numbered 62001–62070 they entered service between May 1949 and March 1950. Use The Peppercorn K1s proved to be useful and versatile engines. They worked extensively over ex-LNER territory but were chiefly associated with North East England and, following in the footsteps of their predecessors the K4s, the West Highland Line. Like so many post- nationalisation classes the K1s had lamentably brief lives. All were withdrawn between 1962 and 1967, but the last to be retired managed to escape the cutter's torch - but only just. They were capable of reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, but they could reach a maximum speed of 45 miles per hour while running tender first. Preservation No. 62005 \\"Lord of the Isles\\" crossing the Glenfinnan Viaduct on the Scottish Adventure, July 2012 One example of the class, No. 62005 Lord of the Isles, has been preserved, and is based at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. It was acquired as a source of a spare boiler for the solitary preserved K4 but in 1972 the K1 was donated, still with its boiler, to the North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group. It was also used as a stationary boiler at ICI North Tees Port Clarence Works for a period of 6 weeks. It was eventually placed into storage at Neville Hill where it was later obtained by Viscount Garnock, Geoff Drury, George Nissen, and Brian Hollingsworth as a spare boiler for the sole surviving member of the Gresley K4 moguls 61994 The Great Marquess. The plans for the stationary boiler never fell through and the locomotive was eventually purchased by the 45428 Stanier Class 5 Locomotive Society Ltd and was later donated to the NELPG. By 1975 the K1 had been restored to main line running order and made an appearance at the Stockton and Darlington Railway 150th-anniversary celebrations at Shildon, County Durham. Since then the NELPG has endeavoured to keep the locomotive available for use on the main line. While it is usually based on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, 62005 spends most of its time on the summer Fort William-Mallaig Jacobite service (numbered as 2005 in 1988 at least), recalling memories of the K1s in Scotland. The locomotive spent much of its early time in preservation numbered 2005 and in LNER apple green livery. This livery is not historically accurate, as the engine was built in 1949 after nationalisation and never had this livery when in service. It was repainted in BR lined black as No.62005 in the late 1990s and wears this livery to date.

The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 people both seated and standing and is nicknamed \\"The Slaughterhouse\\" or \\"Abattoir\\" by fans. The Butchers reference is celebrated at a designated home game once a year, when the stadium floor is sprinkled with saw dust and fans are invited to wear white overalls and hairnets. During Droylsden's recent F.A. Cup tie against Leyton Orient, broadcast live on ESPN, two fans invaded the pitch at the end of the match dressed as butchers. It has partial or full cover on three sides of the pitch, terracing on four sides and seating along the centre of one side, plus a public house. The ground is named after the Butcher's Arms public house, whose landlord in 1892 instigated the formation of Droylsden FC to play on land behind the pub, which became the ground. After the Second World War the lease of the Butchers Arms was sold to Belle Vue F.C., who renamed themselves Droylsden United. And that club took over playing at the ground, forcing Drolysden to move to the nearby Moorside Trotting Stadium. However, the town wasn't big enough for two clubs, especially with bad feeling between them, and after the local council bought the ground, a merger was negotiated and Drolysden returned to the Butcher's Arms ground in 1952, after it had been renovated and the pitch had been rotated to its present position, finally eradicating a long-standing drainage problem.

It is primarily used for football matches. Stonebridge Road was constructed in 1905, and was initially the home of Northfleet FC, which merged with Gravesend FC in 1946. It is currently the home ground of Ebbsfleet United (formerly Gravesend & Northfleet FC). Thus, Stonebridge Road has been the home of Ebbsfleet and its predecessor football clubs for over 100 years. Although one of the Fleet's local rivals, from 2000 to 2006 Dartford had a groundsharing agreement with Ebbsfleet United to use Stonebridge Road as its home. Gillingham used Stonebridge Road briefly for home matches in 1961. Ground details Stonebridge Road, November 2007 The stadium has a capacity of 4,769 people. The average attendance for Ebbsfleet United home ties at Stonebridge Road was 1,165 in the 2006-2007 season. When the Fleet plays at Stonebridge Road, the home supporters typically sit in the Main Stand or in the Plough End. Both those seating areas are covered, although seats were not installed in the Plough End, which is also called the Northfleet End, until 2006. Home fans also stand in the terraced Stonebridge Road Stand, which runs along the length of the pitch on the side of the stadium closest to the street and which is also covered. Away supporters typically stand in the Swanscombe End, which is an open terrace. The pitch size at Stonebridge Road is 112 by 72 yards for football matches, and the pitch is presently maintained by groundsman Peter Norton. The postcode (for maps and directions) of Stonebridge Road is DA11 9GN. History Ebbsfleet United, then called Gravesend and Northfleet F.C., played its first ever match after the merger of the two Kent clubs at Stonebridge Road in August 1946 against Hereford United. The Fleet won that first match 3-0 with more than 5,000 fans in attendance. The stadium's record attendance is 12,032, which was achieved against Sunderland in February 1963 in an FA Cup Fourth Round tie. In April 2002, the Fleet gained promotion to the top level of non-league football, the Conference National, by defeating Bedford Town on the last day of the season at The New Eyrie. The season also saw the highest modern day attendance at Stonebridge Road, an official figure of 4,068 spectators was announced for the game was against title rivals Canvey Island, although unofficial estimates put the number closer to 6,000 fans. Following the club's victory in the FA Trophy in May 2008, the parade honouring Ebbsfleet United's victorious squad started at Stonebridge Road. In July 2014, the construction company PHB agreed a sponsorship deal with the club to rename the stadium as The PHB Stadium, Stonebridge Road. A new sponsorship deal for stadium naming rights was struck in 2017 and the ground is currently The Kuflink Stadium. Future In August 2009 proposals for a new stadium as part of redevelopments in the local areas were rejected by Kent County Council and Gravesham Borough Council. After the owners of the freehold put the site up for auction on 21 September, a group of former directors, Ebbsfleet supporters and MyFootballClub members set up a limited company to raise the funds to buy out the freehold. On 17 September 2009, Gravesham Borough Council announced that they had bought the ground, to be leased to the club at £1 per year, but with the option of the Club purchasing it from the Council if sufficient funds can be raised. In 2016, work began on a new multi- million pound redevelopment of the stadium with the demolition of the Liam Daish stand and adjoining terracing. The resulting structure on the Stonebridge Road side will house all of the operational and commercial offices, as well as hospitality and social facilities and seating. The new stand opened for supporters in December 2016 and was fully operational in November 2017. Because National League requirements state a stadium capacity of 4,000 is in place, the club completed work on a £200,000 strengthening of the Swanscombe End terrace to bring the Kuflink Stadium up to a capacity of 4,769, from its previous 3,134.

Lineage of Thanjavur QuartetThey excelled in the art of Bharatanatyam.The brothers were employed in the courts of the Maratha King Serfoji II at Thanjavur initially, and then moved to Travancore to the Court of Swati Tirunal. Musical training At the encouragement of the King they learnt the nuances of Carnatic music from a number of exponents of their time including Muthuswami Dikshitar. Dikshitar appreciated Vadivelu Pillai as an ekasandhagrahi, one who had the ability to repeat a song heard only once. The quartet wrote a set of nine songs called navaratna mela in tribute of their teacher. After a stint at the courts of Serfoji, the brothers moved to Travancore and were patronised by Swati Tirunal. The king appointed Vadivelu Pillai as the court musician. Vadivelu Pillai also learnt to play the violin gained expertise and demonstrated that not only Kalpita sangeetam but Manodharma sangeetam could also be easily and deftly played on the instrument. Vadivelu was the first to introduce Violin instrument to Carnatic music. He is also credited as the founder of Mohiniyattam. Until then Kathakali was the prevalent dance form in Kerala and was confined to male dancers. Vadivelu elaborated and refined Mohiniattam along with Maharaja Swathi Tirunal, and this paved the way for female dancers in Kerala.  Compositions  The four brothers composed numerous varnams and kritis. Some of these are Amba Souramba and Amba Neelamba, Ambaneelambari (Neelambari), Satileni (Poorvikalyani), apart from the navaratna mala.

It is the home ground of Harrow Borough F.C. The stadium has a capacity of 3,070 people, which includes 350 seats and standing under cover for 1,000 people. The record attendance is 3000 for an FA Cup match against local rivals Wealdstone FC in 1946.  History  Harrow Borough F.C. took residency in 1934, a year after forming. They played their first season at a ground on nearby Northolt Road. A local pavilion was dismantled and rebuilt on the Earlmead site in 1938. Having been presented to the Club by a local land owner Mr G Champniss, later club president, it was to call the Champniss Stand. This stand had room for 250 seated and a further 100 standing. During the Second World War the Pavilion was successfully blacked out and the club could continue playing. Hurricane lamps under biscuit tins with words such as 'way in' and 'turn left' punched out provided signage. In 1947-48 extra covering was built out of Ex-Anderson shelter sheeting and ex-government 6\\" steel tubes. The remains of this covered terracing is still used on the South-east corner of the ground. Earlsmead initially consisted of two pitches but the second pitch was sold to the local council in the early 1970s, who then built Earlsmead Primary School on it. With the money raised from the sale, Harrow Borough F.C. built a new clubhouse and installed new floodlights and new concrete terracing. Whilst this major redevelopment took place, the team played the entire 1973-74 season on opponents' or neutral grounds. In 1995, The Champniss Stand was demolished after 57 years to be replaced with a modern stand to comply with new safety regulations. This new stand, with a seated capacity of 350, was funded through private donations, club fundraising and the Football Foundation.  Location  Earlsmead is on the site of common land on the furthest west side of Roxeth in what was once known as Dabbs Field. In this area, around 850 AD, it is believed there was a now forgotten battle as commemorated in place names such as the Bonefield and the Hundred of Gore. The surrounding area was built as part of the Metro-land developments in the early 1930s. A local housing development, the Earlsmead Housing Estate, appears to have given the ground its name. The streets around the ground are largely named after castles in the British Isles; Windsor, Warwick, Kenilworth, Walton, Arundel, Corfe, Balmoral, Ludlow, Tregenna. The only exceptions being Holyrood Avenue, which appears to be named after the Palace, Ivy, Carlyon Avenue, Somervell Road, Eastcote Lane and Earlsmead itself.  Access  Earlsmead is within 15 minutes walking distance of three London Underground Stations on three separate lines. Rayners Lane (Met/Pic), South Harrow(Pic) and Northolt (Central).Northolt Park (Chiltern Line)British Rail. Bus Routes 140 & 114 stop within three minutes walk of the ground. The H10 through Rayners Lane and 282 through Northolt also pass nearby.Transport for London Journey Planner  See also  Harrow Borough F.C.  References  * Transport for London Journey Planner.

Moores Distinguished Professor of Violin at the Moores School of Music at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas. Early life and musical training Fredell Lack was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the oldest of three children of Jewish Eastern European (Latvian) immigrants, Abram I. Lack and Sarah Stillman Lack (who was a sister of noted painter Ary Stillman).https://www.thestrad.com/obituary-fredell- lack-19-february-1922-20-august-2017/7037.article She began violin lessons at age six, studying with Tosca Berger. When Fredell was 10, she moved with her family to Houston, Texas. There she studied with Josephine Boudreaux, the concertmaster of the Houston Symphony.It Happened in Texas: Josephine Boudreaux at the Houston Symphony by Sherry Cheng. Arts and Culture Texas, 9 Jan 2019. Retrieved 2019-01-26. At age 11, she first soloed with orchestra, performing the Wieniawski Concerto No. 2 with the Tulsa Philharmonic. At 12, Lack was accepted into the New York City studio of the legendary violinist and pedagogue Louis Persinger, whose other students included such artists as Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, and Ruggiero Ricci. She moved to New York and completed her pre-college schooling at the Bentley School while continuing her violin lessons with Persinger. At 17, she made her professional solo debut, playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with the St. Louis Symphony. Subsequently she received a full scholarship to the Juilliard School in New York. She continued studying violin with Persinger there and also was deeply influenced by her study of chamber music with Felix Salmond. She received the Diploma from Juilliard at age 21.  Career  Fredell Lack had a long-lasting career during which she made dozens of concert tours worldwide, including more than twenty to Europe alone. She soloed with the orchestras of New York, Pittsburgh, Stockholm, Houston, Baltimore, Rotterdam, San Antonio, Oslo, and Kansas City, and with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the Royal Philharmonic, RIAS of Berlin, the BBC Symphony, the Hallé Orchestra, and others. With the RIAS Orchestra, Lack performed the European premieres of the Menotti Violin Concerto and the Bernstein Serenade.\\"An American in Vienna\\" by Tanya Tintner. The Record Collector, Winter 2012, p. 39. Retrieved 2017-10-29. She also made a number of recordings (see \\"Selected discography\\" below). Lack made her New York recital debut in 1943 at The Town Hall, performing concertos by Vivaldi and Dvořák, a sonata by Dohnányi, and pieces by Shostakovich, Poulenc, Ysaÿe, and Wieniawski. She commenced artistic study with Ivan Galamian, widely regarded among violinists as the greatest pedagogical influence of the latter half of the twentieth century. She performed frequently in master classes with the Romanian violinist George Enescu, and often traveled to Boston to play new works for the composition studio of Nadia Boulanger. In 1947, Lack was selected to be the first concertmaster of the prestigious Little Orchestra Society of New York, a position she held for two seasons. That year, Lack began performing solos weekly that were broadcast to a national audience over the Mutual radio network. In 1951 she entered the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels, Belgium. Despite the fact that both American finalists were given scores of 0 by the Soviet judge in the final round, Fredell Lack came away with a bronze medal and the Prize of Liège. Also in 1951, Lack moved to Houston, Texas, where her husband had been offered a professorship. About a year later, she suffered what could have been a major setback to her career when a dog bit off the tip of the little finger of her left hand. However, following a year of focused rehabilitation and relearning of technique, she was able to continue performing. Lack and three principal string players from the Houston Symphony formed the Lyric Art Quartet in 1955 and began several chamber music series around Houston. She began a highly successful Young Audiences program in Houston, which brings classical music to schoolchildren. In 1979, that organization gave to Lack its first in an annual series of awards, and the honor was thenceforth named the \\"Fredell Lack Award.\\" In 1959, Fredell Lack began teaching violin at the University of Houston, where she remained on the faculty for 50 years before retiring in 2009. She was the 1982–83 recipient of the Esther Farfel Award, given by colleagues to a single University of Houston faculty member each year. The Texas Music Teachers Association awarded her the Outstanding Teaching Achievement Award (Collegiate), a statewide distinction, in 1990. In 1997, the University of Houston Moores School of Music presented Lack with a Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2007, TexASTA, the Texas division of the American String Teachers Association, presented Lack with the Phyllis Young Outstanding Studio Teacher of the Year Award. Lack also maintained a private studio outside the school. A great many of her students have gone on to musical careers as professional performers and teachers, and a number have become successful solo concert artists. One of Lack's former students, Frank Huang, is currently the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic; he won the top prize at the highly prestigious Naumburg Competition in 2003, has performed as a soloist with major orchestras, and made a critically acclaimed recording debut on Naxos Records.

History The Northolme was opened in the 1850s, and was originally used as a cricket ground. Gainsborough Trinity moved to the ground in 1884, at which time the only spectator facility was a small covered stand in the south-west corner of the ground. Players used the nearby Sun Inn for changing rooms, with the pub building a special extension for use by the football club.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p92, A 200-seat grandstand was later added along the southern touchline, along with a covered terrace on the northern side of the pitch. Trinity were elected to the Football League in 1896, and the first League match at the ground was played on 12 September 1896, with 2,000 spectators watching a 1–1 draw with Manchester City. The ground was still used for cricket, and Trinity occasionally had to play matches at the Bowling Green Ground in the north-west of the town and Sincil Bank in Lincoln.

Early life Barstow was born in Shelburne, Vermont on February 21, 1832, the son of Heman and Lorain (Lyon) Barstow. After teaching in a local school starting at the age of 15, he moved west to Detroit, where he continued to teach. He returned to Shelburne in 1857 to help his aging parents with their farm. In 1861, he was appointed as assistant clerk of the Vermont House of Representatives. Civil War Barstow enlisted as quartermaster sergeant, but was immediately commissioned adjutant of the 8th Vermont Infantry on February 19, 1862. He was given command of Company K as a captain on May 27, 1863, then promoted to major and returned to the regimental staff January 22, 1864. He mustered out with the regiment on June 22, 1864. Barstow was held in such esteem by the members of his regiment that he was presented two ceremonial swords, one when he was promoted to major, the other when the regiment was mustered out. Nearly three years of arduous service in the swamps and humid climate of Louisiana shattered Barstow's health, and for many years malarial diseases deterred him from entering upon any active business pursuits. Soon after the regiment was disbanded, Peter T. Washburn, the adjutant general of the Vermont Militia, offered Barstow a position in the recruiting service, but he was obliged to decline due to his health. In September, 1864, he was elected as a member of the Vermont House, which was in session on October 19, 1864, when the St. Albans raid occurred. Barstow was sent to the scene, later went to Canada on a special mission, and subsequently commanded as a brigadier general one of the militia brigades raised in response. He commanded troops on the northwestern border of the state until relieved by George J. Stannard in January 1865. Postwar career In September 1865, Barstow was unanimously reelected to the Vermont House, and served as state senator from Chittenden County in 1866 and 1867. In 1870, President Grant appointed him U.S. pension agent in Burlington, a position he held for eight years. His efforts in reforming the pension system were rewarded with a letter of thanks from the Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz. In 1879, Barstow was appointed by Governor Redfield Proctor to serve as the state commissioner for the centennial celebration of the surrender of Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia that ended the American Revolution. In 1880 he was elected the 31st Lieutenant Governor. Governor In 1882 Barstow was elected governor, having been nominated with the unanimous vote of the state Republican convention. He was the first Governor of Vermont to call attention to alleged discriminating and excessive rates of freight by transportation companies, and urged the creation of an effective railroad commission. Workers at the Ely Copper Mine in Vershire rioted during Barstow's term after having gone months without payment of their wages. Barstow's response included calling out the militia, which arrived to find that claims of violence had been exaggerated. As part of resolving the crisis, Barstow required that the mine owners pay their workers, which earned him favorable publicity nationwide. The resolution of the Legislature of 1884, requesting the Vermont delegation in Congress to use their best efforts to secure the passage of the interstate commerce law, was passed in pursuance of Governor Barstow's recommendation. At the close of his administration the Rutland Herald expressed the general opinion of his constituents that \\"he had been as careful, independent, able and efficient a ruler as Vermont had enjoyed for twenty years.\\" Later career In 1891 he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to serve on a commission with General Alexander McDowell McCook, U.S. Army, to treat with the Navajo Indians. In 1893 at the request of Governor Levi K. Fuller he was a member of the executive committee of a national antitrust conference. Barstow was a member of the Reunion Society of Vermont Officers, the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was an Episcopalian by religious preference, and was a Mason from 1853. Retirement and death In retirement, Barstow continued to reside in Shelburne. He died in Shelburne, and is buried at Shelburne Village Cemetery. Family On October 28, 1858, Barstow married Laura Maeck (1831–1885) of Shelburne. They were the parents of two sons, Frederick Maeck Barstow (1860–1899) and Charles Lester Barstow (1867–1951). Frederick Barstow graduated from the University of Vermont, worked as a civil engineer, and volunteered for service in the Spanish–American War. He was serving as a first lieutenant with the 3rd U.S. Volunteer Engineer Regiment when he contracted typhoid. His disease was initially thought to be malaria and by the time he was correctly diagnosed and returned to Vermont he was so ill that he died soon afterwards. Charles Barstow graduated from Union College and worked in the book publishing industry. Over the course of his career he was an author and editor for publishers including Harper & Brothers and The Century Company. References Sources * Benedict, G. G., Vermont in the Civil War.

This small North American fish is found in small, moderate, and swift rivers in the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. It is now extirpated from a majority of its range along the Ohio River. Appearance The crystal darter can grow to 12 cm (5 in) in length. It is olive-colored to tan with four dark saddles extending downward to its lateral line, a brownish stripe, and a whitish belly. Its maximum reported age is three years.Gilbert, Carter R. and Williams, James D. National Audubon Society Field Guide to Fishes: North America. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2002. 356. Distribution and habitat The historical range of the crystal darter included the Mississippi River basin, from Wisconsin and Indiana, southwards to southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, the Mobile Basin, Pascagoula, Pearl River, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. It is now absent from much of this range and is rare in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri. It is found in swift-flowing streams with clear or slightly turbid water and moderately swift riffles, on small or medium-sized rivers with beds of sand or gravel. It is not found on silty bottoms or areas with vegetation. Individual fish often hide under stones or bury themselves in sand with just their eyes showing. Reproductive Biology One study focused on the Saline River, Arkansas, suggested that crystal darters spawn multiple times from January through mid- April. Another study, conducted in Alabama, revealed conflicting evidence that suggested the onset of spawning begins in late February and lasts approximately one week in duration. The explanation for such discrepancy in breeding season timing and length is unknown, however, Hubbs (1985) suggested a difference in latitudinal location could explain the variation. Multiple males can copulate with one female at a time. Juvenile crystal darters grow rapidly and reach sexual maturity before age one, but do not spawn until the following season. Most females reach sexual maturity by 50 mm standard length, but males do not mature until they reach 61 mm standard length. Males grow faster and, consequently, adults males are larger than females of the same age. The difference in growth rates and size is probably due to females allocating more of their energy for reproduction. Clutch size ranges from 106-576 mature oocytes per female, and clutch size is positively correlated with fish length. The crystal darter is sexually dimorphic and mature males possess longer soft dorsal and anal fins than females. Burrowing Behavior The crystal darter burrows in sandy substrates with only its eyes protruding. This behavior may have evolved to capture prey, avoid predators, or conserve energy. In 1989, Robert Daniels conducted a study on a closely related species, the Eastern sand darter, Ammocrypta pellucida, to explain burying behavior, but rejected both the prey avoidance and prey capturing hypotheses. He suggested that darters burrow in order to save energy while maintaining their position in the sandy substrate where they live. This behavior may be very important during periods of high or low flow, but can be exhibited at any time. Results from Daniels' study may also explain burying behavior in the crystal darter. Threats The crystal darter is susceptible to a number of threats including overexploitation, habitat degradation through pollution and siltation, and habitat modification through stream flow alterations and artificial impoundment. Small populations of the crystal darter can be affected by scientific or educational collecting. However, collection for research purposes is important in regard to gaining information critical to developing management and conservation strategies to protect the species. Percid species, such as the crystal darter, require clean gravel and sand substrates for reproduction and foraging for food sources. This habitat requirement makes them sensitive to activities that cause pollution and siltation, such as mining, logging, natural gas exploration and extraction, and agriculture. Because crystal darters are geographically confined to a few freshwater systems with clear, fast-moving water they are particularly vulnerable to extinction when their limited habitat is degraded. Soil erosion due to intensive or inadequate agricultural and forestry practices and construction activities has amplified the natural effects of siltation in the water bodies that drain these areas. Increased fine sediment deposition in the water column results in increased turbidity and limited light penetration, which can potentially reduce primary productivity with resulting impacts on the rest of the trophic system, including a reduction in habitat for insectivore prey items. High concentrations of fine sediment can also affect fish by reducing their rate of growth, decreasing their tolerance to disease or directly killing them by clogging gill rakers and filaments. Siltation also reduces the suitability of critical spawning habitat, and thus hinders the stability and growth of future populations. Siltation is particularly threatening to the crystal darter, because it relies on clean sand and gravel habitats to reproduce. In addition, natural fish migration patterns can be modified when certain areas of this route become uninhabitable. Finally, siltation negatively affects the efficiency of hunting in visual feeders, such as the crystal darter. Stream flow modification through channelization and dredging can also affect darter populations. These processes can alter hydrologic regimes by reducing flow velocity through the straightening and widening of channels. Since the crystal darter prefers strong currents, converting fast moving streams into slower moving channels or pools through these modifications can reduce the amount of available habitat to the crystal darter. In addition to altering flow, these modifications also reduce habitat diversity. Artificial impoundments, such as dams, increase the amount of sedimentation in streams by drowning riffles and reducing flow, causing changes in substrate composition. In addition to increasing the effects of siltation, impoundments fragment fish habitat. Fragmentation can affect immigration and emigration between populations, inhibiting connectivity and gene flow. Isolated populations become increasingly susceptible to environmental disturbances, and if these populations were extirpated new fishes would be unable to recolonize and counter these local extinctions. Isolation to reduced ranges due to habitat fragmentation can also inhibit gene dispersal, consequently limiting genetic diversity which can lead to reduced fitness of populations. Conservation The crystal darter is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN on its Red List because of \\"a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat\\".

Camacho \\"Tommy\\" Tanaka (born August 7, 1940) is a Republican politician from Guam, previous Speaker of the territorial Senate from 1979 to 1983, and previous candidate for the position of Governor of Guam. Biography He was born on August 7, 1940 to Tomas Santos Tanaka and Maria Josefina Garcia Camacho, and also the nephew of a former Governor of Guam Carlos Camacho. Tanaka served as a Senator in the Guam Senate. In June 1994, Tanaka is running for Governor of Guam along with his running mate is senator Doris Flores-Brooks, after two-term governor Joseph Ada is term-limited. Tanaka-Brooks won the primary election against outgoing Lieutenant Governor of Guam Frank Blas and senator Simon Sanchez II and winner will face Senator Carl T.C. Gutierrez and Senator Madeleine Bordallo, however during the election day, Tanaka lost the election for both Gutierrez and Bordallo. The election was contested, but the case was decided in favor of Gutierrez. Scandals Gutierrez election In 2003, Tanaka pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony as part of a political corruption probe by the Guam U.S. Attorney's Office in which Tanaka was accused of endorsing previously-rival Democratic candidate Gutierrez in 1997 in exchange for his construction firm receiving a large government contract to build school bus shelters a few months later. Judge William Alsup sentenced Tanaka to two years of supervised release, including six months of house arrest. In the trial, Air America Radio financier Evan Montvel Cohen testified against Tanaka. Tanaka agreed to a plea agreement with the United States Attorneys Office in Guam; there was no trial for him. Rapadas appointment Tanaka was later implicated in allegations that he tried to influence the investigation that had been pursued against him by the U.S. Attorney's Office. In June, 2006, the USDOJ's Office of the Inspector General released their final report on their investigation into allegations made by previous interim U.S. Attorney for Guam Frederick Black that Tanaka's nephew Leonardo Rapadas replaced Black in his position as U.S. Attorney after Black called for an investigation into Washington-based lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Rapadas assumed the position after receiving President Bush's 2002 appointment. According to the investigation, \\"Black stated that he thought Tanaka had used his political influence to get Rapadas the nomination so that Tanaka's criminal matter would disappear.\\" Rapadas was later recused from participation of any ongoing investigations of Tanaka. Black also claimed that Rapadas' nomination was intended to end his ongoing investigations into corruption by public officials in Guam. The OIG determined that Black's allegations were unsupported and that Rapadas' background investigation was sufficient and his appointment appropriate.

However, the underpinnings of much modern Italian music come from the Middle Ages.  Before 1500  Italy was the site of several key musical developments in the development of the Christian liturgies in the West. Around 230, well before Christianity was legalized, the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus attested the singing of Psalms with refrains of Alleluia in Rome. In 386, in imitation of Eastern models, St. Ambrose wrote hymns, some of whose texts still survive, and introduced antiphonal psalmody to the West. Around 425, Pope Celestine I contributed to the development of the Roman Rite by introducing the responsorial singing of a Gradual, and Cassian, Bishop of Brescia, contributed to the development of the monastic Office by adapting Egyptian monastic psalmody to Western usage. Later, around 530, St. Benedict would arrange the weekly order of monastic psalmody in his Rule. Later, in the 6th century, Venantius Fortunatus created some of Christianity's most enduring hymns, including \\"Vexilla regis prodeunt\\" which would later become the most popular hymn of the Crusades. The Guidonian Hand The earliest extant music in the West is plainsong, a kind of monophonic, unaccompanied, early Christian singing performed by Roman Catholic monks, which was largely developed roughly between the 7th and 12th centuries. Although Gregorian chant has its roots in Roman chant and is popularly associated with Rome, it is not indigenous to Italy, nor was it the earliest nor the only Western plainchant tradition. Ireland, Spain, and France each developed a local plainchant tradition, but only in Italy did several chant traditions thrive simultaneously: Ambrosian chant in Milan, Old Roman chant in Rome, and Beneventan chant in Benevento and Montecassino. Gregorian chant, which supplanted the indigenous Old Roman and Beneventan traditions, derived from a synthesis of Roman and Gallican chant in Carolingian France. Gregorian chant later came to be strongly identified with Rome, especially as musical elements from the north were added to the Roman Rite, such as the Credo in 1014. This was part of a general trend wherein the manuscript tradition in Italy weakened and Rome began to follow northern plainchant traditions. Gregorian chant supplanted all the other Western plainchant traditions, Italian and non-Italian, except for Ambrosian chant, which survives to this day. The native Italian plainchant traditions are notable for a systematic use of ornate, stepwise melodic motion within a generally narrower range, giving the Italian chant traditions a smoother, more undulating feel than the Gregorian. Crucial in the transmission of chant were the innovations of Guido d'Arezzo, whose Micrologus, written around 1020, described the musical staff, solmization, and the Guidonian hand. This early form of do-re-mi created a technical revolution in the speed at which chants could be learned, memorized, and recorded. Much of the European classical musical tradition, including opera and symphonic and chamber music can be traced back to these Italian medieval developments in musical notation, formal music education and construction techniques for musical instruments. Even as the northern chant traditions were displacing indigenous Italian chant, displaced musicians from the north contributed to a new thriving musical culture in 12th-century Italy. The Albigensian Crusade, supposedly to attack Cathar heretics, brought southern France under northern French control and crushed Occitan culture and language. Most troubadours fled, especially to Spain and Italy. Italy developed its own counterparts to troubadours, called trovatori, including Sordello of Mantua. Frederick II, the last great Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, encouraged music at the Sicilian court, which became a refuge for these displaced troubadours, where they contributed to a melting pot of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim musical styles. Italian secular music was largely the province of these jongleurs, troubadors, and mimes. One important consequence of the troubadour influence during this period, in Italy and across Europe, was the gradual shift from writing strictly in Latin to the local language, as championed by Dante in his treatise De vulgari eloquentia; this development extended to the lyrics of popular songs and forms such as the madrigal, meaning \\"in the mother tongue.\\" Also around this time, Italian flagellants developed the Italian folk hymns known as spiritual laude. Between 1317 and 1319, Marchettus of Padua wrote the Lucidarium in artae musicae planae and the Pomerium artis musicae mensuratae, major treatises on plainchant and polyphony, expounding a theory of rhythmic notation that paved the way for Trecento music (Italian ars nova). Around 1335, the Rossi Codex, the earliest extant collection of Italian secular polyphony, included examples of indigenous Italian genres of the Trecento including early madrigals, cacce, and ballate. The early madrigal was simpler than the more well-known later madrigals, usually consisting of tercets arranged polyphonically for two voices, with a refrain called a ritornello. The caccia was often in three-part harmony, with the top two lines set to words in musical canon. The early ballata was often a poem in the form of a virelai set to a monophonic melody. The Rossi Codex included music by Jacopo da Bologna, the first famous Trecento composer. The Ivrea Codex, dated around 1360, and the Squarcialupi Codex, dated around 1410, were major sources of late Trecento music, including the music of Francesco Landini, the famous blind composer. Landini's name was attached to his characteristic \\"Landini cadence\\" in which the final note of the melody dips down two notes before returning, such as C–B–A–C. Trecento music influenced northern musicians such as Johannes Ciconia, whose synthesis of the French and Italian styles presaged the \\"international\\" music typical of the Renaissance. During the 15th century, Italy entered a slow period in native composition, with the exception of a few bright lights such as the performer and anthologist Leonardo Giustinian. As the powerful northern families such as the d'Este and Medici built up powerful political dynasties, they brought northern composers of the Franco-Flemish school such as Josquin and Compère to their courts. Starting in the last decades of the century, Italian composers such as Marchetto Cara and Bartolomeo Tromboncino wrote light, courtly songs called frottole for the Mantuan court of Isabella d'Este. With the support of the Medici, the Florentine Mardi Gras season led to the creation of witty, earthy carnival songs called canti carnascialeschi.  Renaissance era, 16th century  Saint Mark's in Venice. The spacious, resonant interior was one of the inspirations for the music of the Venetian School. The 16th century saw the advent of printed polyphonic music and advances in instrumental music, which contributed to the international distribution of music characteristic of the Renaissance. In 1501, Ottaviano dei Petrucci published the Harmonice Musices Odhecaton, the first substantial collection of printed polyphonic music, and in 1516, Andrea Antico published the Frottole intablate da sonari organi, the earliest printed Italian music for keyboard. Italy became the primary center of harpsichord construction, violin production started in Cremona in the workshop of Andrea Amati, and lutenist Francesco Canova da Milano earned Italy an international reputation for virtuosic musicianship. Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa Music achieved new heights of cultural respectability. Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier recommended proficiency at music as a courtly virtue, and Santa Maria di Loreto, the first music conservatory, was built in Naples. Adrian Willaert developed music for double chorus at St. Mark's in Venice. This tradition of Venetian polychoral music would reach its height in the early baroque music of Giovanni Gabrieli. Unlike the earlier, simpler madrigals of the Trecento, madrigals of the 16th century were written for several voices, often by non- Italians brought into the wealthy northern courts. Madrigalists aspired to create high art, often using the refined poetry of Petrarchan sonnets, and utilizing musically sophisticated techniques such as text painting. Composers such as Cipriano de Rore and Orlando di Lasso experimented with increasing chromaticism, which would culminate in the mannerist music of Carlo Gesualdo. In 1558, Gioseffo Zarlino, the premier musical theorist of the period, wrote the Istitutioni harmoniche, which addressed such practical musical issues as invertible counterpoint. Lighter music was represented by the villanella, which originated in popular songs of Naples and spread throughout Italy. Music was not immune to the politically charged atmosphere of Renaissance Italy. In 1559, Antonio Gardano published Musica nova, whose politically pro-republican partisan songs pleased the northern Italian republics and riled the Church. In 1562/1563, the third portion of the Council of Trent addressed issues of music in the Church. Most paraliturgical music, including all but four Sequences were banned. An outright ban on polyphonic music was debated behind the scenes, and guidelines were issued requiring that church music have clear words and a pure, uplifting style. Although the tales of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina \\"rescuing\\" polyphony with the Missa Papae Marcelli are no longer accepted by scholars, Palestrina's music remains the paradigm of the musical aesthetic promoted by the Church. Shortly afterwards, in 1614, the Editio medicea (Medicean Edition) of Gregorian chant was released, rewriting the Gregorian chant repertory to purge it of perceived corruptions and barbarisms, and return it to a \\"purer\\" state closer in style to Palestrinian melodies. In the late 16th century and early 17th century, composers began pushing the limits of the Renaissance style. Madrigalism reached new heights of emotional expression and chromaticism in what Claudio Monteverdi called his seconda pratica (second practice), which he saw originating with Cipriano de Rore and developing in the music of composers such as Luca Marenzio and Giaches de Wert. This music was characterized by increased dissonance and by sections of homophony, which led to such traits of the early baroque as unequal voices where the bass line drove the harmonies and the treble melody became more prominent and soloistic. This transitional period between the Renaissance and baroque included the development of the Sicilian polyphonic school in the works of Pietro Vinci, the first extant polyphony written by women, the fusion of Hebrew texts and European music in the works of Salomone Rossi, and the virtuosic women's music of Luzzasco Luzzaschi performed by the Concerto delle donne in Ferrara.  Baroque era, 16th - 18th centuries  Claudio Monteverdi The exact nature of ancient Greek musical drama is a matter of dispute. What is important, however, for the later development of Italian and European music is that poets and musicians of the Florentine Camerata in the late 16th century thought—in the words of one of them, Jacopo Peri—that the \\"ancient Greeks sang entire tragedies on the stage\\". Thus was born the musical version of the Italian Renaissance: paying tribute to classical Greece by retelling Greek myths within a staged musical context—the first operas. The works emerged in this period with relatively simple melodies and the texts about Greek mythology sung in Italian. (Opera may have deeper roots in the Tuscan maggio drammatico tradition.Lomax, p. 126. Three cities are especially important in this period in Italy: Venice, as the birthplace of commercial opera; Rome, for Palestrina's school of Renaissance polyphony; and Naples, as the birthplace of church-sponsored music conservatories. These conservatories evolved into training grounds, providing composers and musicians for Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. Claudio Monteverdi is considered the first great composer of the new musical form, opera, the person who turned Florentine novelty into a \\"unified musical drama with a planned structure.\\" The years 1600 to 1750 encompass the musical Baroque. A new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion of instrumental resources of the orchestra. The keyboard was extended, and the making of stringed instruments by Antonio Stradivari became a great industry in Cremona. Instrumental music started to develop as a separate \\"track,\\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the sonata, symphony, and concerto. Important names in music within this period in Italy are Alessandro Scarlatti, and Antonio Vivaldi, representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period. Teatro San Carlo, Naples The physical resources for music advanced greatly during the 18th century. The great opera houses in Naples and Milan were built: the Teatro di San Carlo and La Scala, respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan—and then Italian—Comic opera. Important, too, is the restoring of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Pietro Trapassi, called Metastasio. Important Italian composers in this century are: Domenico Scarlatti, Benedetto Marcello, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Niccolò Piccinni, Giovanni Paisiello, Luigi Boccherini, Domenico Cimarosa, and Luigi Cherubini. It is also the age in which Italian music became international, so to speak, with many Italian composers beginning to work abroad. Giuseppe Verdi  19th century  The 19th century is the age of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Italian opera forsakes the Comic opera for the more serious fare of Italian lyric Romanticism. Although the generally light-hearted and ever-popular Rossini was certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of Bellini and Donizetti, giving to Italian music the lyrical melodies that have remained associated with it ever since. Then, the last fifty years of the century were dominated by Giuseppe Verdi, the greatest musical icon in Italian history. Verdi's music \\"sought universality within national character\\"; that is, much of what he composed in terms of historical themes could be related to his pan-Italian vision. Verdi was the composer of the Italian Risorgimento, the movement to unify Italy in the 19th century. Later in the century is also the time of the early career of Giacomo Puccini, perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music. Frontispiece from the score of Cavalleria rusticana, a masterpiece of Italian Verismo from 1890 Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of Italian musical form in the 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost to the exclusion of other forms, such as the symphony. There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of Brahms in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a Stabat Mater and his late Petite messe solennelle and Verdi Messa da Requiem and Quattro pezzi sacri. Romanticism in all European music certainly held on through the start of the 20th century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Even the realistic plots and more modern compositional techniques of the operas of Italian verismo, such as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, did not greatly affect the extremely melodic nature of Italian music.

The song is sung from the perspective of a man who has lived a hedonistic life - \\"Crystal champagne, pearls, porcelain/Diamonds for dinner, love for dessert\\" - and who appears to be either giving this lifestyle up or preparing to die (the lyrics are unclear on this point). He sings, however, that \\"I never regret a thing, never regret\\". The performance involved both Paul and his female dancers performing kinky gestures and adopting sexually suggestive poses. The song was performed twenty-fifth on the night (following the United Kingdom's Katrina and the Waves with Love Shine a Light). At the close of voting, it had received 18 points, placing 20th in a field of 25. With the rapid expansion of the Contest, the decision was taken to restrict entry to the 1998 Contest to those countries achieving the best average score over the previous five years, a group which did not include Iceland. As Iceland broadcast that Contest, they were permitted to return in the following year along with the other \\"passive participants\\". Thus, the song was succeeded as Icelandic representative at the 1999 Contest by Selma with \\"All Out Of Luck\\". A brief excerpt from the performance was shown as part of a montage at the Congratulations special, provoking a positive reaction from the audience.

Stone rubbing is the practice of creating an image of surface features of a stone on paper. The image records features such as natural textures, inscribed patterns or lettering. By rubbing hard rendering materials over the paper, pigment is deposited over protrusions and on edges; depressions remain unpigmented since the pliable paper moves away from the rendering material. Common rendering materials include rice paper, charcoal, wax, graphite or inksticks. Over time, the practice of stone rubbing can cause permanent damage to cultural monuments due to abrasion. For an artist, stone rubbings can become an entire body of creative work that is framed and displayed. Technique The paper that has been used by Chinese scholars to transfer the calligraphy from stones is made from plant fiber. It can be used in two ways to retrieve the calligraphy. One way requires the paper to be dry and then adhered to the stone through a paste made with water and a starch that is made from rice or wheat. The paper is then tamped into the engravings on the stone. The other technique requires the paper to be wet and tamped into the engravings without a paste.Perkins, Dorothy. “stone rubbings, Chinese.” Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 1998. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. 28 Jan. 2010 <>. After doing either of these techniques, an ink, created through grinding an ink stick and adding water one drop at a time to achieve the ideal consistency, is used to retrieve the calligraphy. The ink is stippled on with a cloth filled with the ink. The ink covers the paper without sinking into the engravings. When the paper is peeled off, the calligraphy engravings come out white, while everything else is black from the ink. More commonly, people use butcher paper to create stone rubbings. The butcher paper is usually taped on to the stone or grave, which contains the inscription desired, with either masking or paint tape. Then, usually, charcoal or crayon is rubbed over the stone or grave, leaving the engravings untouched by the crayon. When the butcher paper is removed, the inscriptions should be readable because they are not marked with the crayon.“Headstone Art.” Ancestry. July/August 2008: 55. Print.<>. It can be helpful to clean the stone beforehand, to ensure optimum results. A soft brush and water is usually what works best to cleanse the stones. One should not use stiff or hard brushes, as they can scratch the stone. Also, one should not use cleaning solutions or mild detergents on the stones, as they can damage the stone.“Cemeteries.” Massachusetts Studies Project. 28 Jan. 2010 <>. When stone rubbing, one should be careful with stones that are deteriorating, as they can collapse under pressure. Gravestone rubbing Gravestone rubbing also applies this technique to gravestones, often as a method of retrieving and conserving information about genealogy. For a genealogist, a gravestone rubbing may become a permanent record of death when a gravestone is rapidly deteriorating. Rubbings are commonly made by visitors to the US Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Visitors use pencil and paper to copy the name of a family member or friend who died during the Vietnam War off of the wall. The rubbing forms a type of souvenir. Gravestone rubbing can be used to teach about local history. The stone’s condition, art, and inscription can tell what was going on in an area at a specific time. Studying multiple gravestones in one specific area can give even more information about history.

Amatitán can also be reached from Guadalajara by car driving north on Mexican Federal Highway 15, it is a drive of about 45 minutes and the road is kept in fairly good shape. The economy of the municipality of Amatitán, like that of the surrounding areas, relies heavily in the production of tequila beverage. Its agriculture is dominated by the cultivation of the agave plant, which is used to produce the tequila. The climate in Amatitán is hot and dry which suits the agave plant well. There is usually one rainy period during the year that lasts from June through September, when most of the residents grow their other dominant crop, corn, which requires significantly more water. There is virtually no artificial irrigation in the area and most farmers still depend on rainwater for the irrigation of their fields. Some residents also raise cattle and other livestock, mainly for regional consumption. The lifestyle of its inhabitants is mostly of a rural nature and the residents are mostly Catholic.

It was released in Japan in 2006, and in Western regions in 2007; AQ Interactive published the game in Japan, while Atari was the publisher for other regions. The Windows version was released by Xseed Games in April 2018. Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, the story follows the witch Alicia Claus as she hunts a powerful demon. Players control Alicia through linear levels, using her gun to fire multiple types of ammunition at humanoid and demonic enemies. Beginning development in 2004 as Cavia's first game for seventh generation consoles, Bullet Witch was developed by the same team behind Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. The character and monster designs, created respectively by Satoshi Ueda and Taro Hasegawa, fused Western and Japanese sensibilities. The music was composed by Masashi Yano supervised by Nobuyoshi Sano. The game received mixed to negative reviews from Japanese and Western critics. Gameplay Gameplay in Bullet Witch; Alicia advances through a level as part of the environment explodes in front of her. Bullet Witch is a third-person shooter where players control the witch Alicia and her unseen companion \\"Darkness\\" while navigating a three-dimensional post-apocalyptic world. The game's six levels are divided into semi-open environments, ranging from urban to country settings. Environments include destructible objects and combustibles that generate explosions when damaged. At the beginning of each level Alicia is assigned a variety of abilities and weapon attributes. Alicia has a health meter and magic meter, both of which automatically regenerate over time. Restorative items to speed up regeneration can also be received from non-playable characters (NPCs) Alicia saves from attack. Combat is primarily based around using Alicia's \\"gun rod\\" weapon and magic abilities against normal enemies and during scripted boss battles. While Alicia mainly fights alone, she is joined by NPCs for later major battles. Her gun rod transforms into multiple types of guns, each with different ammunition types, firing rates and damage. When the game starts Alicia only has access to the rod's machine gun mode, but skill points acquired after completing levels can be used to unlock shotgun, canon, and Gatling gun modes. Reloading after a magazine is exhausted costs Alicia magic points. Each gun type can be augmented with additional functions or deal higher damage by using magic. Alicia can also perform a melee attack when close to enemies. Alicia has access to magic spells, which are assigned to three rings based on their strength. Basic spells include creating a temporary shield, imbuing ammunition with elemental damage abilities, and spearing enemies from beneath; second level spells include throwing objects, summoning a hoard of ravens to attack enemies, and giving up a portion of health to revive injured allies and non- playable characters; the third level summons powerful natural phenomena such as tornadoes, meteor showers and lightning storms to destroy large groups of enemies. Using spells cost varying amounts of magic points depending on their level, and each can be upgraded using skill points. Upgrades to health, guns and magic are unlocked with skill points earned based on a ranking, which takes in damage taken, enemies killed and the length of time it took to complete a level. Synopsis In the wake of multiple natural disasters culminating in a demon invasion in 2007, Earth has become a wasteland, and by the year 2013 humanity is on the brink of extinction. Alicia Claus, a witch guided by a demonic power dubbed the \\"Darkness\\", enters a near-deserted American city. Despite the Darkness saying the city is doomed, Alicia helps the survivors and ends up helping local resistance forces led by Maxwell Cougar evacuate survivors. During her time there, she and the resistance are forced to flee from Omega—a powerful demon immune to magic and gunfire—and Maxwell asks for her aid in saving humanity. While they work together, Maxwell gives Alicia a journal fragment revealing that an archeologist performed a ritual to revive a loved one after she died in a plane crash—his actions opened a portal allowing the demons to attack humanity. Alicia accompanies the resistance forces to the location of the portal, aiding them and further survivors along the way. When she reaches the portal's location, she discovered the archeologist still alive as a prisoner of the portal. Receiving the remaining journal entries from him, Alicia discovers that she herself is the archeologist's daughter and is only alive and able to wield magic due to his actions. Alicia is forced to kill her father to close the portal, although the remaining demons still control Earth. Alicia and Maxwell return to the city and finally defeat Omega through their combined strength, liberating the city from demon control. Despite this victory, the battle is far from over, and despite Maxwell's growing attachment to her, Alicia decides to continue her mission. Newspaper articles during the credits show humanity defeating the demons and recovering from the natural disasters while Alicia continues wandering the world. Development Development of Bullet Witch lasted approximately two years, being handled by the same team who developed Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex for the PlayStation 2. It was the first game developed for seventh generation consoles by Cavia. The concept for Bullet Witch originated from loosey inspired Mahōtsukai Kurohime manga before the next generation of hardware had been revealed to developers, beginning its concept development for sixth generation hardware. After the developers were shown the Xbox 360, they were impressed with its development tools and additional features such as the Xbox Live functions, deciding to develop Bullet Witch for that platform. While development for the PlayStation 3 was considered, the team had begun work on the Xbox 360, and decided to stay on a single platform to deliver the best possible experience. The game used both internal and external staff, with a team size estimated at being between 100 and 120 people. Between 20 and 30 programmers worked on the game. The game was produced by Toru Takahashi. The director was Yōichi Take, who co-wrote the scenario with Akira Yasui. According to Take, the scenario had a somber tone to suit its setting, and was quite brief when compared to other video game narratives. The character of Alicia was described as a combination of Japanese and Western character archetypes; while her Gothic witch appearance drew from Western fiction, her melancholy persona and ironic humor were based in Japanese traditions. The character designs and art direction were handled by Satoshi Ueda. The menus and other 2D assets were designed by Satoko Tsushima. Tsushima also designed the game's logo. The in-game cinematics were directed by Yasui, with the higher graphical power of the console enabling more character expression than in Yasui's previous work. The creature designs were handled by Taro Hasegawa. One monster he described in detail was the humanoid Geist, which he needed to redesign several times; his first draft was refused due to being overly complex to render, with later versions being created with input from other staff members. The larger monsters dubbed Megas were designed around the concept of players jumping on them during battle, but due to hardware limitations this aspect of gameplay was cut. The game's monsters, like Alicia, were a fusion of Western and Japanese design elements. Fuji Wahara was in charge of character motion, and worked hard to make character movements realistic while keeping to the exaggerated tone and style of the game. The lead artificial intelligence designer was Tomoyuki Ando. When creating Bullet Witch, the team were pleased with the shift to high-definition graphics, but this and the game's identity as a new intellectual property meant they were taking financial risks. The move to next-generation hardware meant the team could include more destructible environments. They used 64-bit computing at a few points to speed up data exchange and improve visual effects. The game used the NoviceX physics engine. Working with the next- generation hardware was both exhilarating and difficult, as the team wanted to create something new rather than rely on existing code resources. The team wanted players to be able to navigate large areas with few or no loading screens, but these ambitions were originally muted by the console's limited power, and it was only during the later stages of development that they started resolving the issues. Due to the console's limitations, some potential effects and touches such as breaking glass, bullet marks in surfaces like building walls, and having Alicia's feet adjust to the slope of terrain had to be left out to increase processing power for the large-scale environments. While the team had wanted to achieve 60 frames per second, the team needed to reduce the framerate to 30 per second so all the effects would run smoothly. Music The music for Bullet Witch was composed by Masashi Yano, then part of music studio SuperSweep. Yano had previously written the score for the CGI cutscenes of Drakengard 2. The soundtrack was a collaboration between internal and external staff. As the visuals were designed to appear cinematic, the developers wanted the music to emulate that atmosphere. Cavia staff were responsible for deciding upon the music with the external staff, who then composed the music. The music was supervised by Cavia staff member Nobuyoshi Sano, mixed by Delfi Sound's Toshihiro Hayano, and mastered by Masami Kanda of Memory-Tech Corporation. When brought on board the project, Sano asked for Yano, whose musical style emulated Hollywood orchestral scores. Yano and Sano were originally going to work on the score together, with Yano handling the orchestral segments and Sano in charge of percussion and bass. Take wanted the soundtrack to stand out, but when Sano added together their two styles of music, he negatively compared the result to a song from Japanese variety show Nanikore Chin Hyakkei. Sano was so distressed that he insisted Yano handle all aspects of the music. The soundtrack and soundscape were created using 5.1 surround sound, which Sano found to be a mixed experience. While this enabled a wider range and depth of sounds, it also made coordination and balance more difficult. Despite the difficulties, he found the resultant effect superior to the two-channel sound of his previous projects. The theme song \\"The Vanishing Sky\\" was composed by Yano and arranged by Sano, with lyrics and vocals performed in English by Asako Yoshihiro. Release Bullet Witch was first announced in December 2005 in a special event held by its Japanese publisher AQ Interactive. Originally scheduled for release on July 13, 2006, the game was pushed forward by several weeks. The game was eventually released on July 27, 2006. It was later re-released as part of the Japanese \\"Xbox 360 Platinum Collection\\" on June 14, 2007. Following the game's Japanese release, Atari successfully pitched to publish the game outside Japan. According to Atari, the game was chosen for localization due to its unique premise, in addition to showcasing the capacities of next generation gaming hardware. In addition to localizing the game, Atari worked to improve the gameplay experience for Western players, adjusting the camera and character controls for a tighter experience, and improving enemy artificial intelligence. Another element that underwent adjustments was the Gun Rod, which was seen as overpowered in the Japanese version. The game was released in North America on February 27, 2007. In Europe, the game released on March 9, and in Australia it released on March 16. A Microsoft Windows port was released on April 25, 2018. It was developed by Marvelous and published by Xseed Games. Reception Review aggregate site Metacritic was given a score of 55 out of 100 based on 59 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu praised the atmosphere and spectacle, but noted difficulties during combat and handling the camera. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh negatively referred to the game as \\"Japanese fetish gaming in full effect\\", being satisfied with the gunplay and magic systems but finding most other aspects either poorly designed or lacking substance. GamePro was highly critical, faulting almost every aspect of the game's design, feeling that there was nothing good about the game and that it was not worth buying despite a promising premise. Joe Juba of Game Informer felt that the game had potential and praised the enemy designs, but its poor execution held the game back from being a fully enjoyable experience. Greg Mueller, writing for GameSpot, praised the destructible environments and spell casting while faulting most other aspects of the game—he concluded that \\"Bullet Witch shows promise, but it ultimately fails to deliver anything more than a [forgettable] ho-hum third-person shooter\\". IGN's Erik Brudvig was unimpressed by most aspects of the game and highly critical of the gameplay and lack of content, calling it \\"short and shallow\\". Lewis Cameron of Official Xbox Magazine found the gameplay dull and repetitive despite liking the variety of attack options, and faulted most other aspects including the graphics and localization. VideoGamer.com's Will Freeman enjoyed the magic system and later levels, but criticized the graphics and its \\"basic\\" content. Sales During its debut week in Japan, Bullet Witch reached 21st place in gaming charts with sales of 9,083 units, being the best-selling Xbox 360 title that week. By December 2007, combined sales of the original release and Xbox 360 Platinum Collection re-release totaled 27,098 units. In the United Kingdom, Bullet Witch failed to register the general gaming charts, but was seventh in the Xbox 360 charts.

The cartridge is a .380 ACP case necked-down to hold a .32 caliber bullet with the goal of improved ballistic performance over the .32 ACP. History and Design Bottleneck handgun cartridge designs experienced early success and have had continuing development since at least the 7.65×25mm Borchardt or earlier, which led to the development of the 7.63×25mm Mauser (also known as the .30 Mauser), followed by the 7.62×25mm Tokarev. The benefits of bottleneck designs include smooth feeding and chambering and simple, robust headspacing. The .32 NAA uses the .312\\" diameter bullet of the .32 S&W;, .32 S&W; Long, .32 H&R; Magnum, and .327 Federal Magnum, and .32 ACP. The .32 NAA is one of the most recent of a line of commercial bottleneck handgun cartridges. Renewed western interest in bottleneck handgun cartridges began with the .357 SIG in 1994 (necking a .40 S&W; case down to a .355 bullet); followed by the .400 Corbon in 1996 (necking a .45 ACP case down to hold a .40 cal. bullet); and then the .25 NAA in 1999 (necking a .32 ACP case down to hold a .25 caliber bullet). 2015 saw the introduction of the 7.5 FK bottleneck cartridge by the Czech company FK BRNO. Performance The cartridge delivers in excess of velocity to a 60 grain (3.9 gram) proprietary bullet from Hornady. This generates of energy from the 2.5\\" Guardian barrel (1453 ft/s & from a 4\\" test barrel). According to Phil W. Johnston, the 60 gr Corbon cartridge averaged 1204 fps, with an extreme spread of 69 fps and a standard deviation of 19 fps, for 193.09 ft-lbs of energy. When fired at ballistic gelatin, he obtained 6.25\\" of penetration, with expansion to 0.528\\" and 72% weight retention. Extreme Shock Ammunition offers an \\"Enhanced Penetration Round\\" that sends a 60 gr. bullet at 1196 fps for 190 ft lbs of energy.

Early years  He was born in Kingston upon Thames in 1933, the eldest of seven children, and later evacuated to Oxfordshire and then Cornwall during the Second World War. He attended Truro Cathedral School on a choral scholarship where he was Head Boy and Captain of the Rugby XV. Following school, Christopher served in the RAF as a Pilot Officer (Navigator) and trained in Canada. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge, to read English after which he completed the Overseas Civil Service Course for Administrative Officers.  Career  In 1958 Turner joined the Colonial Service in Tanganyika as a District Officer rising to become the youngest District Commissioner in Africa. It was during this time that he married Irene Philomena de Sousa and together they had three children Paul, Eva, and Camilla. Following Tanzania's independence, he was asked by President Nyerere to stay on. He became a regional Magistrate and, later, worked within the Ministry of Education. In 1970 he returned to the Colonial Service where he was stationed in New Hebrides as a District Agent. In 1978 Christopher was recognized for his work by being awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE). By the time New Hebrides became independent Vanuatu in 1980, he had been Financial Secretary and was Chief Secretary and Acting Resident Commissioner for the colony. Turner’s popularity in the islands was such that his obituary was published in the national newspaper more than 30 years after his departure.Obituary in the Vanuatu Daily Post He spent the next two years in Hong Kong as Senior Assistant Secretary. Turner was witness to the sun setting on some of the last parts of the British Empire. In 1982 Turner was appointed Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The islands were being used as a refuelling point for light aircraft plying the illegal supply route of narcotics from South America to the United States and, in conjunction with the American Drug Enforcement Administration, he played a key role in disrupting this traffic, and his success in this activity resulted in death threats being made against him, after which armed bodyguards were required for his protection. In 1987 was appointed Governor of the island of Montserrat. In 1990 he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Later that year he retired from government service to enter the commercial world. He worked for McLane Company (USA) becoming the Managing Director of the UK office, and then in 1996 joined the Cambridge-Myers Consulting Group (USA) where as Senior Project Manager he travelled around the world.  Later years  Turner retired in 2004 to live in Winchester, England where he continued to travel, garden, and entertain his seven grandchildren with tales of his exploits abroad.

Early life and education Chisiza was born on 8 August 1930 in Florence Bay (now Chiweta or Chitimba) in the Karonga District of Nyasaland (now Malawi). He was the youngest and eleventh child of Kaluli Chisiza, a village headman and farmer. He, like his older brother Yatuta, was educated at Uliwa Junior Primary School and later, as a boarder at the Livingstonia Mission. He left school in 1949 after failing his Standard VI examination. Chisiza went north to Tanganyika (now Tanzania), where in 1949 he briefly worked as a clerk in the police records department in Dar es Salaam. He studied for four years at Aggrey Memorial College in Uganda, earning a Cambridge International General Certificate of Education. There, he joined and became secretary of the Nyasaland Students' Association active at Makerere College in Kampala, and supported himself by working odd jobs. During this time, he joined the Baháʼí Faith, but later left after learning the religion was opposed to political involvement. He described it as \\"a religion for free people whose countries are free from foreign domination. In 1952 and 1953, he was a member of an American-led team that did a study tour of the Belgian Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo).  Activities in Rhodesia  Chisiza briefly returned to Nyasaland, before going to Southern Rhodesia in 1953, where he worked as a clerk interpreter and translator for the Indian High Commission in Salisbury (now Harare). One of his responsibilities there was the publication of a regular information bulletin. In Salisbury, Chisiza lived in the Matapi Hostel, and joined the Mashonaland branch of the Nyasaland African Congress. He became involved with Rhodesian anticolonial activists like James Chikerema and George Nyandoro, and in 1955, he was one of the founders of Southern Rhodesia African National Congress Youth League. Along with Nyandoro and Edson Sithole, he formed the City Youth League (CYL), whose first major accomplishment was the 1956 Salisbury bus boycott. He was deported from Southern Rhodesia in September 1956 to Nyasaland.  Activities in Nyasaland  In Nyasaland, he began working at a family butchery and continued his political activities, including in opposition to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1957, he participated on behalf of the Nyasaland African Congress in constitutional discussions with the colonial administration. In 1957 and 1958, he lived in Birmingham, England and attended Fircroft College, where he studied economics, sociology, and political science, with a focus on the economics of developing countries. While in England, he began correspondence with Hastings Banda, later the first President of Malawi. He was, it is thought, first commended to Banda in a letter (dated 6 July 1957) from Henry Chipembere, who described him as a young man he would like for his 'extreme views' and as 'a self-made intellectual of no university attainments who surprised all with his mental powers'. He met Banda in person in London in June of that year, when, together with Chipembere and Chief Kutanja, they met with the Colonial Secretary, Lennox-Boyd, to discuss a new constitution for Nyasaland (one which had already been roundly rejected by Nyasaland's governor, Robert Armitage). Lennox-Boyd 'took note' of their views but said he didn't think the Congress represented Nyasa African opinion. In August 1958, at Banda's request, Chisiza returned to Nyasaland and, at a meeting of the Congress in Nkhata Bay on 1 August, was nominated as Secretary General of the Malawi Congress Party. He, together with his brother, Yatuta, Kanyama Chiume and Henry Chipembere, worked tirelessly to promote Banda's image as saviour of the native peoples of Nyasaland. He was a key organiser of Nyasaland African Congress and part of the inner circle that met on 24–25 January 1959 to discuss a change of approach from non-violence to violence where necessary. Chisiza was arrested, along with other high-profile African dissidents, in the dawn raids of Operation Sunrise on 3 March 1959, when the colonial administration, responding to incidents of rioting in various areas of the country, declared a state of emergency in Nyasaland. He was imprisoned in Gwelo, Southern Rhodesia, in the European wing of the jail together with Banda, Chipembere and his brother Yatuta (and separately from many other Africans jailed after Operation Sunrise). He was released, some months after Banda, in September 1960 and in December participated in constitutional talks also involving Banda and Orton Chirwa in London. These were the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference, and the Federal Review Conference, the latter which was to review the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Early in 1961, he visited India where he took part in demonstrations at the American and Belgian embassies protesting the CIA- assisted murder of Patrice Lumumba, the first Prime Minister of the Congo. His pamphlet \\"Africa – What Lies Ahead\\" was published by the Indian Council for Africa. In August 1961, Chisiza was elected to represent Karonga in the Legislative Council and became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Henry Phillips (later Sir Henry Phillips). It appears that during this early period in the run-up to independence, Chisiza and Banda had severe and sometimes heated disagreements over policy. In April 1962, together with his now-mentor Henry Phillips, he visited London for discussions regarding Nyasaland finances. His favourable attitude toward a possible loan for a hydroelectric project to be made through the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (opposition to which was the proximate cause, many would say, for the independence movement in Nyasaland) reportedly caused Banda to become extremely annoyed. The rift was such that, according to some reports, Chisiza resigned or threatened to resign. Some sources allege that he seriously contemplated forming an opposition party, possibly along with Henry Chipembere, once independence had been achieved. Economic development In July 1962 he hosted an economic development symposium, sponsored by the Ford Foundation, at which authorities from around the world presented papers on African and Malawian development. He himself gave a presentation warning of the dangers of dictatorship in emerging African countries. (Among his publications was the aforementioned paper entitled \\"Africa – What Lies Ahead?\\", published by the African-American Institute, New York, in 1962). The conference was an unqualified success. In the short time of his prominence, Chisiza gained enormous respect in the west for his intellect, energy and pioneering ideas. Death Chisiza died on 3 September 1962, while driving back to Zomba from Blantyre. His cream-coloured Mercedes was found in a small stream bed beside a bridge at Thondwe, on the road to Zomba. An inquest concluded he had died from a fracture at the base of his skull. He left a wife and three sons. One, Dunduza Chisiza Jr., was born subsequent to his death and became one of Malawi's most prominent playwrights.

It was founded in 1920 by Horatio Bottomley, elected in the 1918 general election as an independent Member of Parliament. In 1919, Bottomley founded the People's League. He hoped the League would become \\"a great Third Party\\" which would represent \\"the People\\" against organised labour and organised capital. The 4th Marquess of Salisbury was also initially involved in the League. According to Sir Oswald Mosley, he and Leslie Hore- Belisha were also active members. In 1920, Bottomley complemented the League by forming the \\"Independent Parliamentary Group\\" with other MPs sympathetic to his ideas, while still using the People's League to stand George Makgill in the 1920 Leyton by-election. Several Members of Parliament joined the group, including Bottomley, Cecil Beck, Christopher Lowther, Claude Lowther,F. W. S. Craig, Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections Charles Frederick Palmer and Sir C. V. F. Townshend. It also sponsored several candidates; John Nicholson accepted its support, but after winning the 1921 Westminster Abbey by-election, did not join the group. Murray Sueter, who was co-sponsored by the group and by the Anti-Waste League, was elected in the 1921 Hertford by- election. Later in 1921, a business venture of Bottomley's, the John Bull Victory Bond Club, was sunk by fraud and mismanagement. In the ensuing scandal, the group was disbanded, and the following year, Bottomley was expelled from Parliament.

This trade was a predecessor of modern banking. The advent of paper money in the mid-17th century and the development of modern banking and floating exchange rates in the 20th century allowed a foreign exchange market to develop. This provided a way for banks and other specialist financial companies such as bureaux de change and forex brokers to easily change one country's money for another, and with the added confidence of transparency. The 20th century also saw the development of machines that would change money, such as coin dispensers and change machines. History Jesus casting out the money changers in Herod's Temple Money changer by Pietro di Miniato, 1412. In ancient times in Jerusalem, pilgrims visiting the Jewish Temple on Jewish Holy Days would change some of their money from the standard Greek and Roman currency for Jewish and Tyrian money, the latter two the only ones accepted as payments inside the Temple.Sanders, E. P. The historical figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993.Ehrman, Bart D.. Jesus, Interrupted, HarperCollins, 2009. With this Temple money the pilgrim would purchase a sacrificial animal, usually a pigeon or a lamb, in preparation for the following day's events. During the Middle Ages in Europe, many cities and towns issued their own coins, often carrying the face of a ruler, such as the regional baron or bishop. When outsiders, especially traveling merchants, visited towns for a market fair, it became necessary to exchange foreign coins to local ones at local money changers. Money changers would assess a foreign coin for its type, wear and tear, and validity, then accept it as deposit, recording its value in local currency. The merchant could then withdraw the money in local currency to conduct trade or, more likely, keep it deposited: the money changer would act as a clearing facility. As the size and operations of money changers grew they began to provide a lending facility, by adding the lending-fee to the foreign exchange rates. Later the Knights Templar provided this service to pilgrims traveling to and from the Holy Land.Martin, Sean (2005). The Knights Templar: The History & Myths of the Legendary Military Order. p. 47, New York: Thunder's Mouth Press. .Nicholson, Helen (2001). The Knights Templar: A New History. p. 4, Stroud: Sutton. . Mechanical device A coin dispenser A money changer (or coin changer or coin dispenser) is a device that changes or dispenses coins. It can take various forms. One type is a portable coin dispenser, invented by Jacques L. Galef, often worn on a belt, used by conductors and other professions for manual fare collection. It dispenses a single coin when a lever is depressed. Another type is a fixed coin dispenser that dispenses several coins at once, such as four quarters or five nickels, for making change at a venue for coin-operated devices, such as a penny arcade, pinball parlor, or Automat. It is typically mounted in a manned booth or counter. A third type, sometimes called a \\"change maker\\" or \\"Automatic Cashier\\", has an array of 100 or more buttons that dispense exact amounts of change from 1¢ to $1.00. These are typically found at teller windows in banks and sometimes in retail establishments. This type of change maker may also operate electromechanically under control of a cash register, automatically giving correct change for a customer's purchase.

Sophiology (, by detractors also called Sophianism or Sophism ) is a controversial school of thought in Russian Orthodoxy which holds that Divine Wisdom (or Sophia) is to be identified with God's essence, and that the Divine Wisdom is in some way expressed in the world as 'creaturely' wisdom. This notion has often been understood or misunderstood (depending upon one's point of view) as introducing a feminine \\"fourth hypostasis\\" into the Trinity.W. Goerdt in The Encyclodedia of Christianity (2008), p. 122. The controversy has roots in the early modern period, but Sophiology as a theological doctrine was formulated during the 1890s to 1910s by Vladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), Pavel Florensky (1882–1937) and Sergey Bulgakov (1871–1944).Philosophy of Economy («Философия хозяйства» 1912) and Unfading Light («Свет Невечерний» 1917).. In 1935, parts of Fr. Sergius Bulgakov's doctrine of Sophia were condemned by the Patriarch of Moscow\\"The teaching of Professor and Archpriest S.N. Bulgakov – which, by its peculiar and arbitrary (Sophian) interpretation, often distorts the dogmas of the Orthodox faith, which in some of its points directly repeats false teachings already condemned by conciliar decisions of the Church…\\" Moscow Patriarchate (1935) Decision No. 93 and other Russian Orthodox hierarchs.Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (1935) Decision of the Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad of the 17/30 October 1935 concerning the new teaching of Archpriest Sergei Bulgakov on Sophia, the Wisdom of God Although Bulgakov was censured by the aforementioned hierarchs, a committee commissioned by Metropolitan Eulogius to critique Bulgakov's Sophiology found his system questionable, but not heretical, and issued no formal censure (save for a minority report written by two members of the committee, Fr. Florovsky and Fr. Chetverikov).. For Bulgakov, Theotokos St. Mary was the world soul and the “Pneumatophoric hypostasis”, a Bulgakov neologism. Thomas Merton studied the Russian Sophiologists and praised Sophia in his poem titled \\"Hagia Sophia\\" (1963). The Roman Catholic Valentin Tomberg in his magnum opus Meditations on the Tarot incorporated many Sophiological insights into his Christian Hermeticism, pairing the Holy Trinity (Father-Son-Holy Spirit) with the Trino-Sophia (Mother-Daughter-Holy Soul), which together he called “The Luminous Holy Trinity”. The book’s Afterword was written by Hans Urs von Balthasar and kept on the nightstand of Pope John Paul II. Johnson (1993) and Meehan (1996) noted parallels between the Russian \\"sophiological\\" controversy and the Gender of God debate in western feminist theology.Elizabeth Johnson, She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse (1993) Meehan, Brenda, \\"Wisdom/Sophia, Russian identity, and Western feminist theology\\", Cross Currents, 46(2), 1996, pp. 149–68. Personified representations of Holy Wisdom (Ἁγία Σοφία) or the \\"Wisdom of God\\" refer in Orthodox theology to the person of Jesus Christ, as illustrated in the Acts of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea II, 787): \\"Our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, the self-existent Wisdom of God the Father, Who manifested Himself in the flesh, and by His great and divine dispensation (lit. economy) freed us from the snares of idolatry, clothing Himself in our nature, restored it through the cooperation of the Spirit, Who shares His mind…\\" Acts of the Second Council of Nicea. More recently it has been stated that \\"From the most ancient times and onwards many Orthodox countries have been consecrating churches to the Lord Jesus Christ as the Wisdom of God.\\"Sobolev, Archbishop Seraphim (1935) The New Teaching concerning Sophia the Wisdom of God. p. 121.

As well as being a fan-favourite, the song is a live staple, and an extreme display of Mogwai's quiet/loud dynamic contrast method. An 18-minute-long version of \\"Like Herod\\" (recorded live by Steve Lamacq from a BBC Radio Session at the BBC Recording and Broadcast Studio in Maida Vale in March 1999) appears on Mogwai's live compilation album, Government Commissions: BBC Sessions 1996-2003.

Musical composition \\"Like Herod\\" is an 11-minute 39 second long instrumental in the key of E minor. The song begins with a bassline similar to that of the Manic Street Preachers' song \\"Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit'sworldwouldfallapart\\": 400px This is joined at (0:04) by a guitar, doubling the bassline, and at (0:16) by quiet drumming, and an additional guitar counter-melody. At (0:46), the song progresses into an alternate melody, based around the chord of C major seventh, which is repeated, then the song goes back to repeating the main melody until (1:30), where the alternate melody is repeated once more. The drums then begin to get quieter and quieter, coming to a halt at (2:15), leaving only the guitars and the bass to play the main and alternate melodies themselves, which they do until (2:57), when all the instruments explode in a barrage of deafening noise, featuring a heavy drumbeat and highly distorted, screeching guitars. This continues until (4:51), where the original bassline is introduced once more, and the original drumbeat begins playing. At (5:17), the drumbeat stops abruptly and all that is heard is the bassline, and a guitar, plucking a muted note. This continues, with the plucked note becoming gradually more erratic, until (6:15), when all of the instruments explode into another torrent of noise, almost identical to the last one, albeit with more guitar feedback in the background. This continues until (8:08), when the drumbeat becomes calmer, the guitar feedback becomes more subdued, and the bass can be heard quietly in the background, repeating a heavily distorted note at the start of each bar. At (10:11), the drumbeat ends and all that can be heard is the steady pulse of the ride cymbal, the distorted bass note, and a guitar feedbacking, until (10:20), when it seems to go gradually upwards in pitch, ending at (10:29). Snippets of feedback are heard momentarily as the bass note continues to be played, until (11:05), when the bass note plays one last time, and begins feedbacking, along with subdued guitar noise in the background, until (11:35), when all the instruments cease playing and the song ends. Critical reception During professional reviews, \\"Like Herod\\" received mostly good reception. The song is an album track pick at Allmusic. Brandon Wu of Ground and Sky notes the \\"raw power in [the] piece, but unlike the best Mogwai pieces it lacks any sort of melody or beauty.\\" However, Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine dismisses the song as \\"good-but-redundant.\\" Trivia * The song was also featured in the intro-sequence in the PlayStation version of Actua Ice Hockey 2.

Just like last years entry, a version was recorded in Icelandic but was not commercially released. The song is an up-tempo pop song, with the singer calling on the object of his affections to come to him and \\"fly me away\\". It appears from the lyrics that the pair had previously been together, in a relationship which did not end well. The song was performed second on the night (following the Netherlands' Michelle with Out On My Own and preceding Bosnia and Herzegovina's Nino Pršeš with Hano). At the close of voting, it had received 3 points, placing 22nd (equal last) in a field of 23. Due to the rapidly expanding contest, the decision was taken to restrict entry to the 2002 Contest to the countries that had finished in the top 15 of the 2001 Contest, plus the countries that had been excluded from the 2001 event due to a low five-year point average from 1996–2000; neither group included Iceland which was therefore relegated from the 2002 Contest. As a \\"passive country\\" (one which broadcasts the Contest without participating in it), Iceland was permitted to return to the fold in 2003.

Name The name ‘Qasavara’ is itself from the language of Mota, but the same deity is known under other names in neighboring islands: in Vurës, in Mwotlap, in Mwesen. Mythology Qat, the Great Spirit who made everything, and his twelve brothers were invited to spend the night in the house of a giant named Qasavara. The giant intended to kill them while they slept and eat them, but Qat opened a crack in one of the beams of the house and the brothers hid inside the beam. In the end, Qasavara became so frustrated that one morning he chased Qat and his brothers up a casuarina tree. Qat caused the tree to grow so long that when it bent over, the tip touched a neighboring island. The brothers jumped off and the tree, released from the extra weight, sprang back, throwing Qasavara high into the sky. When Qasavara struck the ground, he died and was transformed into a stone. This stone still existed in recent times: those who desired success and strength in battle would make sacrifices upon it. Another lesser- known version portrays Qasavara as the gatherer of the spirits of the damned, who he then feeds to mythical monsters.

It was later offered in the Model 660 and Model 700 (one numerous various caliber configurations) rifles but was discontinued as a regular factory chambering in 1974 after a poor sales record. Remington has also offered the Model Seven MS from their Custom Shop and a limited edition 700 Classic in recent years chambered in .350 Remington Magnum. Remington began chambering the round in the new Model 673 Guide Rifle in 2002.A Blast from the Past in Field & Stream This caliber was also sold as a chambered size configuration in a line of long range shooting and competition handguns, the Remington XP-100. History At the time of its introduction the .350 Remington had a short, fat case, similar to the current crop of short magnums except that the .350 carries a belt. Its closest competitor, the .35 Whelen was still just a wildcat from a necked-up .30-06, so the .350 Rem was the most powerful .35 caliber around, and in a short cartridge that allowed the use in compact quick-handling rifles.The .350 Remington Magnum in Guns&Ammo; However, gun writers and shooters of the time were not yet enamored of the short-fat concept as they are today, and they preferred the older longer .35 Whelen based on the .30-06 cartridge, even though it had, at best, similar performance in short barrels.The .350 Remington Magnum and .35 Whelen by Chuck Hawks Today the .350 Rem has had some improvement in acceptance, due to the shorter cartridge being able to fit in a .308 length action.Compared: the .35 Calibers by Chuck Hawks Though the cartridge has great merit, it has never attained tremendous popularity. This is due in no small part to the rather vicious recoil produced when firing the cartridge from the lightweight Model 600 it was initially chambered in. The Model 673 and Model 7 so chambered are a full pound heavier at 7.5 lbs, and do better to mitigate recoil. Still, with the .30-06 Springfield being toward the upper end of what many shooters find tolerable in a 7-8 pound sporting rifle, the .350 Remington Magnum remains a bit of a niche cartridge with a small but dedicated following. Maximum pressure for the .350 Remington is set at 53,000 CUP by SAAMI. Use The .350 Remington Magnum is a fairly powerful cartridge, but the magazine length of the rifles it is usually chambered in, does limit its ability to use longer, heavier bullets with higher ballistic coefficients. Still, with certain bullets and handloading, it is a capable 500+ yard big game cartridge. Its premier use, though, is more as a \\"brush gun\\", basically defined as a short, handy rifle that is more easily maneuvered in environments where shots are likely to be closer, and opportunities appear and disappear quickly. At reasonable ranges, the .350 Remington Magnum is capable of taking any game on the North American continent effectively and humanely. It would also be suitable for many African species, though some African nations have a .375\\" (9.53mm) or .400\\" (10.2mm) minimum caliber requirement for dangerous game. Comparison The .350 Rem. Mag. offers ballistics equal to the .35 Whelen in a shorter cartridge, hence more compact rifles. With longer barrels, the .350 Rem surpasses the Whelen.

The region is also covered in large part by Mediterranean pine forests. At a distance of to the west of the district center, in the direction of Milas, is the ancient site of Stratonikeia, in the present-day village of Eskihisar, and at walking distance from the ancient city is its sanctuary Lagina, near the present-day township of Turgut. Turgut was called Leyne officially until recent date and is still called as such locally. Another spot of interest is the village of Çaybükü on the road to Muğla. The village has an old and restored coffee house, Belen Kahvesi, mentioned in a nationally renowned song called \\"Ormancı\\", which has as theme a tragic event that took place there in 1946. The coffee house is a tourist attraction today both because of the curiosity aroused by the song and also due to its views of the surrounding plain. Once again, Çaybükü had a different official name, Gevenes, until the 1950s and that name is still used locally. An unsuccessful petition was even made by the inhabitants in 2006 for a return to the former name, but while the Ministry of Interior Affairs could accept Geven, it did accept Gevenes.

With its capital at Vienna, the archduchy was centered at the Empire's southeastern periphery. Its present name originates from the Frankish term Oustrich - Eastern Kingdom (east of the Frankish kingdom). The Archduchy developed out of the Bavarian Margraviate of Austria, elevated to the Duchy of Austria according to the 1156 Privilegium Minus by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The House of Habsburg came to the Austrian throne in Vienna in 1282 and in 1453 Emperor Frederick III, also Austrian ruler, officially adopted the archducal title. From the 15th century onwards, all Holy Roman Emperors but one were Austrian archdukes and with the acquisition of the Bohemian and Hungarian crown lands in 1526, the Habsburg hereditary lands became the centre of a major European power. The Archduchy's history as an imperial state ended with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1806. It was replaced with the Lower and Upper Austria crown lands of the Austrian Empire. Geography Armor of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, created for then-Archduke Ferdinand in 1549, with Reichsadler on the boots signifying his title King of the Romans. The parade armour was crafted by the eminent master plate armourer Kunz Lochner from Nuremberg. Located in the Danube basin, the ancient Roman province Pannonia Superior, Austria bordered on the Kingdom of Hungary beyond the March and Leitha rivers in the east. In the south it was confined by the Duchy of Styria, with the border at the historic Semmering Pass, while in the north the Bohemian Forest and the Thaya river marked the border with Bohemia and Moravia. In the west, the Upper Austrian part bordered on the Bavarian stem duchy. The adjacent Innviertel region belonged to the Bavarian dukes, until it was occupied by Austrian forces during the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778 and incorporated into the archducal lands according to the Peace of Teschen. In the course of the German mediatisation in 1803, the Austrian archdukes also acquired the rule over the Electorate of Salzburg and the Berchtesgaden Provostry. History After Austria was detached from Bavaria and established as an Imperial estate in 1156, the Babenberg dukes also acquired the neighbouring Duchy of Styria in 1192. After the extinction of the line in 1246 and the occupation by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, it was seized by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany, who defeated Ottokar in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld and enfeoffed his son Albert I. In 1358/59 the Habsburg duke Rudolf IV, in response to the Golden Bull of 1356, already claimed the archducal title by forging the Privilegium Maius. Rudolf aimed to achieve a status comparable to the Empire's seven prince-electors, the holders of the traditional Imperial 'arch'-offices (cf. Archchancellor); however, his attempts failed as the elevation was rejected by the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV. By the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, his heirs divided the Habsburg lands, whereafter the Austrian duchy remained under the rule of the Albertinian line. From Duchy to Archduchy On Epiphany 1453 Emperor Frederick III, regent of Austria for his minor Albertinian cousin Ladislaus the Posthumous, finally acknowledged the archducal title. It was then conferred to all Habsburg emperors and rulers, as well as to the non-ruling princes of the dynasty, however, it still did not carry the right to vote in the Imperial election. Frederick further promoted the rise of the Habsburg dynasty into European dimensions with the arrangement of the marriage between his son Maximilian I and Mary the Rich, heiress of Burgundy in 1477. After Maximilian's son Philip the Handsome in 1496 had married Joanna the Mad, Queen of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, his son Charles V could come into an inheritance \\"on which the sun never sets\\". Nevertheless, Charles' younger brother Ferdinand I claimed his rights and became Archduke of Austria according to an estate distribution at the 1521 Diet of Worms, whereby he became regent over the Austrian archduchy and the adjacent Inner Austrian lands of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and Gorizia (Görz). By marrying Princess Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, Ferdinand inherited both kingdoms in 1526. Also King of the Romans from 1531, he became the progenitor of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg (Habsburg-Lorraine from 1745 on), which as Archdukes of Austria and Kings of Bohemia ruled as Holy Roman Emperors until the Empire's dissolution in 1806. Austrian Empire In 1804, Emperor Francis II of Habsburg who was also ruler of the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy promoted his territories within the Holy Roman Empire together with his Kingdom of Hungary to the Austrian Empire in reaction to Napoleon I's proclamation of the French Empire; two years later Francis formally dissolved the Holy Roman Empire. The Archduchy of Austria continued to exist as a constituent crown land (Kronland) within the empire, although it was divided into Upper and Lower Austria for administrative purposes. Hungary preserved its earlier status as Regnum Independens. The title of archduke continued to be used by members of the imperial family and the archduchy was only formally dissolved in 1918 with the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the creation of the separate federal states of Lower and Upper Austria in the new Republic of German Austria.

After the ruling dukes of the House of Babenberg became extinct in male line, there was as much as three decades of rivalry on inheritance and rulership, until the German king Rudolf I took over the dominion as the first monarch of the Habsburg dynasty in 1276. Thereafter, Austria became the patrimony and ancestral homeland of the dynasty and the nucleus of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1453, the archducal title of the Austrian rulers, invented by Duke Rudolf IV in the forged Privilegium Maius of 1359, was officially acknowledged by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III. Geography Initially, the duchy was comparatively small in area, roughly comprising the modern-day Austrian state of Lower Austria. As a former border march, it was located on the eastern periphery of the Empire, on the northern and southern shores of the Danube River, east of (\\"below\\") the Enns tributary. Drosendorf, Raabs, Laa and other fortifications along the Thaya River, north of the historic Waldviertel and Weinviertel regions and separated by the Manhartsberg range, marked the border with the Duchy of Bohemia (elevated to a Kingdom in 1198) and the Moravian lands, both of which were held by the Czech Přemyslid dynasty. In the east, the Imperial border with the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia) had gradually shifted towards the plains of the Morava River and the eastern rim of the Vienna Basin. On the right shore of the Danube, the lower Leitha River marked the Imperial–Hungarian border for centuries. In the south, Austria bordered the Styrian lands which were likewise elevated to a duchy, and unified with Austria in 1192. History The territory originally inhabited by Celts was for centuries crossed in transit by several Germanic tribes and from the 6th century onwards settled by Avars as well as by Slavic tribes, who about 600 founded the independent principality of Carantania in the south. The Avar Khaganate established in 567 comprised most of the later Austrian march up to the Enns river, where it bordered on the German stem duchy of Bavaria. Temporarily part of Samo's Empire from 631 to 658, the territory was under constant attack by the Carolingian forces of Charlemagne from 791 onwards. About 800 Charlemagne, having won several victories against the Avars, established a frontier march in the region between the Enns and Raab rivers, called the Avar March, part of the marcha orientalis. The East Frankish margraviate was again lost to the invading Magyars at the 907 Battle of Pressburg, and re-established as the Bavarian March of Austria after King Otto I of Germany's victory at the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. In 976 Emperor Otto II enfeoffed the Babenberg count Leopold the Illustrious with the Austrian margraviate. A large-scale German settlement (Ostsiedlung) along the Danube down to the border with Hungary followed, which ultimately disrupted the Slavic continuity between the West Slavic (Slovak) and South Slavic (Slovene) lands. House of Babenberg Although today closely associated with the Habsburg dynasty, Austria was, until 1246, a feudal possession of the younger House of Babenberg. Margrave Leopold the Generous (1136–1141) was a loyal vassal of the imperial House of Hohenstaufen in the struggle against the Bavarian Welf dynasty. In 1139, after King Conrad III of Germany deposed the Welf duke Henry the Proud, he gave the Bavarian duchy to his half-brother Margrave Leopold. Leopold's brother and successor Henry Jasomirgott was enfeoffed with Bavaria in 1141. In 1156 the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick Barbarossa approached a settlement with the Welfs. At the 1156 Imperial Diet in Regensburg, Henry Jasomirgott had to renounce the Bavarian duchy in favour of Henry the Lion. In compensation, the Babenberg margraviate was elevated to an equal duchy, confirmed by numerous privileges granted by the Privilegium Minus on 17 September. The new Austrian duke took his residence at Vienna at the site of the later Hofburg Palace. He also founded Schottenstift Abbey as the Babenberg proprietary church, settled with Irish monks. The Austrian lands prospered, due to their favourable location on the Danube, as an important trade route from Krems and Mautern via Vienna down to Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. For a short time, the Babenbergs came to be one of the most influential ruling families in the Empire, peaking under the reign of Leopold V the Virtous (1177–1194) and Leopold VI the Glorious (1194–1230). In 1186, they signed the Georgenberg Pact with the first and last Otakar duke Ottokar IV of Styria and, upon his death in 1192, acquired the adjacent Styrian lands in the south, which were ruled with Austria in personal union until 1918. They also expanded their territory into the old Bavarian lands west of the Enns River, along the Traun to the city of Linz, the future capital of Upper Austria. Klosterneuburg In 1191 Duke Leopold V joined the Third Crusade and the Siege of Acre. Once the city was conquered and occupied, he picked a fierce quarrel with King Richard the Lionheart, allegedly over Leopold's raising of his Babenberg banner beside the royal flags of Richard and Philip II of France. When the English king passed through Austria on his way home, Leopold had him abducted and arrested at Dürnstein Castle. Handed over to Emperor Henry VI, Richard was only released after paying an enormous ransom, and the duke used his share to lay out the Wiener Neustadt fortification near the Hungarian border. According to legend, the emperor granted him permission to bear the red-white-red colours that became the flag of Austria. His son Leopold VI, sole ruler of the Austrian and Styrian lands from 1198, married the Byzantine princess Theodora Angelina and later married his daughter Margaret to Henry of Hohenstaufen, son of Emperor Frederick II, in 1225. Notable minnesingers like Reinmar von Hagenau and Walther von der Vogelweide were regular guests at the Vienna court and Middle High German poetry flourished. The poem Nibelungenlied probably arose in the Austrian lands. However, Leopold's son, Duke Frederick II the Warlike, entered into fierce conflicts soon after his accession in 1230, not only with the Austrian nobility, but also with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, King Andrew II of Hungary and even with Emperor Frederick II for the alleged entanglement in the rebellion of the duke's brother-in-law Henry of Hohenstaufen. The latter earned him an Imperial ban and an expulsion from Vienna in 1236. Though he could later reconcile with the Emperor, the border conflict with Hungary culminated in several clashes of arms after 1242, after King Béla IV of Hungary marched into Austria to reconquer occupied lands. Duke Frederick was killed at the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River, whereby the Babenberg line became extinct in the male line. Fortune and fall of King Ottokar According to feudal law, the immediate heritable fees fell back to the suzerain, the Holy Roman Emperor. However, Emperor Frederick II, in the last years of his rule, was weakened by the struggle against Pope Innocent IV, and was stuck in the Italian Wars between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. His death in 1250 and the death of his only surviving son King Conrad IV four years later ended the line of Hohenstaufen rulers, only eight years after the extinction of the Babenberg dynasty. The extinction led to the Great Interregnum, a period of several decades during which the status of the country's rulers was disputed. While in the following years several candidates were elected King of the Romans, none of them were able to control the Empire. Ottokar's acquisitions until 1276, superimposed on modern European borders It was the ambitious Přemyslid ruler Ottokar II of Bohemia, son of King Wenceslaus I, who took the occasion to take over the rule in the \\"princeless\\" lands of late Duke Frederick II the Warlike. Referring to the Privilegium Minus, Pope Innocent IV, against the feudal principle of patrilineal inheritance, confirmed the hereditary rights of Frederick's sister Margaret, widow of Henry of Hohenstaufen, and his niece Gertrude, widow of Ottokar's elder brother Přemyslid Margrave Vladislaus of Moravia who died in 1247. Upon the death of Gertrude's second husband, Margrave Herman VI of Baden, in 1250, Ottokar invaded the Austrian lands, acclaimed by the local nobility. To substantiate his claims, he married Margaret (about 30 years his senior) in 1252. King Béla IV of Hungary contested this, referring to the Gertrude's third marriage with his relative Roman Danylovich and occupied the Styrian lands. However, Ottokar prevailed as he defeated the Hungarian troops at the Battle of Kressenbrunn. Bohemian king since 1253, he now was sole ruler of the Bohemian, Moravian, Austrian and Styrian lands—an anticipation of the early modern Habsburg Monarchy after 1526. In 1269, Ottokar also effectively controlled the Duchy of Carinthia, with Carniola and the Windic March further in the south. He controlled, in all, a Central European realm stretching from the Polish border in the Sudetes towards the Adriatic coast in the south. When he failed to be elected King of the Romans in 1273, he contested the election of the successful candidate, the Swabian count Rudolf of Habsburg. Nevertheless, Rudolf was able to secure his rule as the first actual German king after the Great Interregnum. By his Imperial authority he seized Ottokar's \\"alienated\\" territories and added them to his already extensive homelands in Swabia. King Ottokar was finally defeated and killed by the united Austrian and Hungarian forces in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. House of Habsburg Habsburg (orange), Luxembourg (violet) and Wittelsbach (green) dominions within the Holy Roman Empire, 14th century Rudolf married his daughter Judith off to Ottokar's son Wenceslaus II, who retained the Bohemian kingdom. Having reached an agreement with the prince-electors, he granted the Austrian domains to his sons Albert and Rudolf II at the 1282 Diet of Augsburg, elevating them to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The right of primogeniture was implemented with the Treaty of Rheinfelden one year later. Rudolf's descendants ruled Austria and Styria until 1918. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Habsburgs accumulated further provinces in the southeastern part of the Empire: the Duchy of Carinthia with the March of Carniola, initially ceded to the House of Gorizia, came under Habsburg rule in 1335; the County of Tyrol was ceded to Duke Rudolf IV of Austria by Countess Margaret in 1363. These territories, together, became known as the Habsburg 'Hereditary Lands', although they were sometimes referred to in sum as Austria. Rudolf established his residence at the Vienna Hofburg Palace and in 1358/59 he had the Privilegium Maius forged to elevate himself to a privileged 'archduke' of the Empire. The following two centuries were turbulent for the duchy. Under Habsburg rule, several inquisitorial persecutions against Waldensians were carried out, notably by the cleric Petrus Zwicker in the late 14th century. Following the brief, yet eventful, rule of Duke Rudolf IV, his brothers Albert III and Leopold III divided the Austrian domains between themselves, in accordance with the Treaty of Neuberg, signed in 1379. Albert retained Austria proper, while Leopold took the remaining territories. In 1402, there was another split in the Leopoldian line, when Duke Ernest took Inner Austria (i.e. the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola) and Duke Frederick IV became the ruler of Tyrol and Further Austria. The partitions decisively weakened the Habsburg position, in favour of their rivals from the Luxembourg and Wittelsbach dynasties. The Habsburg Albertinian line was again elevated to the Imperial throne, when in 1438 Duke Albert V of Austria was chosen King of the Romans as the successor to his House of Luxembourg father-in-law, Emperor Sigismund. Although Albert's reign spanned only one year, he was succeeded by his Leopoldian cousin, Duke Ernest's son, Frederick V, who eventually reunified the Habsburg territories, after the extinctions of the Albertinian line (1457) and the Elder Tyrolean line (1490). Duke Frederick was crowned Holy Roman Emperor (as Frederick III) in 1452; he formally acknowledged the elevation of Austria to an archduchy one year later, whereafter all Habsburg princes bore the archducal title. Only two non-Habsburgs reigned the Empire between 1438 and 1806, when Emperor Francis II resigned.

The parent of this cartridge is the .30-06 Springfield, which is necked-up to accept a bullet diameter of . This cartridge is more powerful than its parent, especially in killing power on large game. History Handloading is popular among .35 Whelen owners because of the wide variety of available bullets in comparison to commercially loaded ammunition. Pictured from left to right are a 275-grain soft-point bullet, a 200-grain plastic-tipped copper bullet, a 110-grain frangible revolver bullet for varmint hunting, and a 270-grain cast bullet for metallic silhouette shooting. The .35 Whelen was developed in 1922 as a wildcat cartridge. Remington Arms Company standardized the cartridge as a regular commercial round and first made it available in the Remington model 700 Classic in 1988. One version of its origin is that it was designed by Colonel Townsend Whelen when he was commanding officer of the Frankford Arsenal. In a 1923 issue of American Rifleman Col. Whelen refers to it as \\"the first cartridge that I designed\\" and states that, \\"Mr. James V. Howe undertook this work of making dies, reamers, chambering tools, and of chambering the rifles, all in accordance with my design.\\" James V. Howe was a toolmaker at the Arsenal and later a founder of Griffin & Howe. In his 1940 book The Hunting Rifle: Design, Selection, Ballistics, Marksmanship, Col. Whelen gives a different version of its origin after describing the .400 Whelen. > About the time we completed development of this cartridge, I went on a long > hunting trip in the Northwest, and when I returned, Mr. Howe showed me > another cartridge he had developed.

Performance Suitable bullets range in weight from . Using a bullet, the .35 Whelen will generate at the muzzle from a barrel. The .35 Whelen is not the ballistic twin of the .350 Remington Magnum and falls about 500 foot pounds short. With the correct bullet choice this cartridge is suitable for virtually all thin-skinned large and dangerous game. The European designation for this cartridge would be 9 × 63 mm; with its wide bullet selection and high muzzle energy it is in the same echelon as the venerable 9.3×62mm.

As a musician, he is best known for his work with Superchunk, the Mountain Goats, and Bob Mould. He is also known for appearing on The Best Show with Tom Scharpling. Wurster has recorded and performed live with Jay Farrar, Ben Gibbard, Robert Pollard, Katy Perry, The New Pornographers, Rocket from the Crypt, Alejandro Escovedo, and R.E.M. Music career Early music career Wurster grew up in the southeastern Pennsylvania town of Harleysville and began playing drums at the age of ten, taking lessons for a few years before playing in local bands. In 1984 Wurster joined the psychedelic punk band Psychotic Norman. The band shared bills with the Minutemen, Die Kreuzen, and Suicidal Tendencies and recorded a three-song 7\\" single before Wurster left in January 1986 to play with rock band the Right Profile . Months after Wurster's arrival, the Right Profile was signed by Clive Davis to Arista Records. In April, 1987 the band recorded demos in Memphis, Tennessee with Jim Dickinson and Jerry Lee Lewis's guitarist Roland Janes at Sam Phillips's Recording Studio. Soon after this session, co-founding member Stephen J. Dubner left the band to pursue a writing career. Dubner would go on to great success as co-author of the book Freakonomics. Dickinson and The Right Profile began sessions for their debut album at Ardent Studios in the summer of 1987, but the album was never completed. The band continued for four more years, eventually changing their name to the Carneys. A five-day recording session in 1989 produced by drummer Steve Jordan at New York City's The Hit Factory has been cited by Wurster as crucial to his development as a drummer. A cross-country tour to Los Angeles to find a record deal proved unsuccessful, and the Carneys broke up in August 1991. Andy York, the guitarist on the final tour, would go on to play with John Mellencamp. The Right Profile's 1986-87 lineup reformed for a benefit show in August 2018 at the Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill. Wurster moved to Chapel Hill in March 1991 and joined the band Superchunk in October just before the release of its second album, No Pocky for Kitty. Wurster has drummed on every Superchunk album since No Pocky. After eleven years of recording and touring, Superchunk went on hiatus in 2002. During the hiatus Wurster worked with Caitlin Cary (2002); The Minus 5 (2002); Marah (2003); Chris Stamey (2004), and Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices (2006). In November, 2006 Superchunk played with The Mountain Goats at The Daily Show tenth anniversary party at Irving Plaza in New York City. In addition to performing a comedy sketch with Samantha Bee of Daily Show, Wurster played three songs with the Mountain Goats. As a result, he was invited to drum on the duo's west coast tour in 2007. Wurster played drums and percussion on the Mountain Goats' 2007 album Heretic Pride and joined the band after the release of the album. He has drummed on every subsequent Mountain Goats album. As the 2008 Heretic Pride tour was ending, he was contacted by bassist Jason Narducy about replacing Bob Mould's drummer on the west coast leg of Mould's District Line tour. Wurster flew from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles the day after the Mountain Goats' last show and played his first show with Mould the next night in Solana Beach, California. Wurster has drummed on every Bob Mould album since 2009's Life and Times and became a member of the Bob Mould Band. He has recorded or performed live with Aimee Mann, R.E.M., Dave Grohl, The Pretenders, Nick Cave, Ben Gibbard, Charlie Daniels, Britt Daniel, The Bangles, Katy Perry, Guided By Voices, Ryan Adams, Rocket from the Crypt, Magnapop, The New Pornographers, Margaret Cho, Jay Farrar, Alejandro Escovedo, Split Single, Chris Stamey & Peter Holsapple, and The Connells.

Comedy/The Best Show Wurster met New Jersey native Tom Scharpling on June 19, 1992 at a My Bloody Valentine/Superchunk/Pavement show in New York City. The two found common comedy and musical ground and became good friends. Over the ensuing years, Wurster and Scharpling kept in touch, coming up with comedy ideas that would eventually find a home on Scharpling’s WFMU radio show. The duo’s first performance on Scharpling’s WFMU show occurred on November 19, 1997 and featured Wurster calling in as Ronald Thomas Clontle, the misguided, egotistical author of a music reference book titled Rock, Rot & Rule. Listeners believed the call to be a real interview with a real author and called in to argue with Clontle over pronouncements like \\"Madness invented ska\\" and \\"David Bowie rots because he’s made too many changes.\\" The Clontle call was eventually released on CD in 1999 as Rock, Rot & Rule via the duo’s Stereolaffs label. Rock, Rot & Rule saw its first vinyl release in 2015 on Flannelgraph Records. Scharpling & Wurster continued their partnership when Scharpling’s The Best Show on WFMU debuted in 2000. It was during this period that Philly Boy Roy, Hippy Johnny, Bryce Chastain and other beloved Best Show characters (all voiced by Wurster) were introduced.

Background: Central Committee resignations  A convention held by the People's United Party on September 27, 1956 settled a long political dispute that had hindered the party's development for some time. 10 members of the Central executive of the PUP, led by Leigh Richardson and Phillip Goldson, resigned and vowed to form their own political party.  Formation and leaders  The HIP was formed on October 4, 1956, and elected its leaders on October 15. They included: * Party Leader Leigh Richardson * Deputy Phillip Goldson * Chairman William Coffin * Vice Chairman Frank Tench  Aims  * Belizean self-government within the Commonwealth * Higher standard of living for all with more training and opportunity * Cooperation with management and labour for the betterment of the country.  Reception by Belizeans  As the HIP prepared to contest the 1957 general election, Belizeans had a few questions for them. How serious was the PUP split, and could it be repaired? If the party wanted independence, even eventually as the name suggested, why split with the PUP in the first place? And just what the heck was \\"Honduras\\", anyway? (Shoman). A puzzled electorate offered nearly 18% of its votes, but no seats, to the new party, placing them second behind the victorious PUP. For a summary of results, see 1957 British Honduras legislative election.  Devolution  A discouraged Richardson resigned as Leader in February 1958 and left for Trinidad. Goldson carried the party along a little further, but he had no choice but to meet with members of the National Party (Belize) (NP) to ask for a merger. The details were worked out in early summer, and the HIP was dissolved on June 25, 1958 (one day before the NP) and merged to form the National Independence Party (Belize) on July 1.

The business was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1942, by Harvey Tallman, who bought the auto wrecking business and expanded into war surplus, then later, tools and equipment.Princess Auto - Our Story Overview Princess Auto is a Canadian retailer with its headquarters in Winnipeg, Manitoba.Princess Auto As of November 2019, the company owns and operates 48 stores in ten provinces, three distribution centres (DC), one DC in Winnipeg, one DC in Calgary, and one DC in Milton, Ontario. In 2015 a manufacturing division in Winnipeg was closed. .Princess Auto careersPrincess Auto locations Princess Auto also offers online sales, a National Call Centre, and mail order service.About Princess Auto Various items are sold under its \\"Powerfist\\" and \\"Pro.Point\\" brands. Princess Auto sells many brand name tools, however, Powerfist tools tend to be lower-cost tools when compared to mid price professional brands such as Pro.Point, UltraPro (NAPA), Craftsman (Sears), or Westward. History The Beginning: In 1942, Harvey Tallman acquired a small-time auto wrecker in the heart of Winnipeg with the money he made selling his truck. In the early days of Princess Auto Wrecking, Harvey sourced auto parts that he could sell to his customers at a better value than his competitors. From the very beginning, Harvey demonstrated a willingness to search for good products and offer them to his customers at an incredible value. The 1950s Harvey was aware that he needed help running the business, and hired quality people, to work both behind the counter and in the warehouse, ultimately contributing to the company’s continued growth. The company made a decision to start sourcing items for farm and industrial use from the US. Harvey found fields of decommissioned airplanes in the States and had people working with him that had the technical knowledge to convert these items into products like custom air compressors. The 1960s The company continued to sell through its mail order catalogue and the parts counter while focusing on delivering exceptional customer service and products that were unique and fun. Harvey started hearing about huge amounts of surplus overseas and soon found himself at army bases all over Japan buying surplus by the crate. Of the extensive list of products to come out of these trips, KYB jacks were among the customer favourites of which Harvey managed to become the exclusive North American distributor. The 1970s Princess Auto and Machinery continued to grow, expanding into hydraulics made by their manufacturing division, Shur-lift Industries. Merchandising teams looked towards the surplus shows in Las Vegas to continue to bring in unique and strange products when war surplus began to dwindle. A mail strike signaled to Harvey and his sons, Bob and Larry, that the future of the company would be as a retail destination. The first Princess Auto retail location opened in Edmonton. The 1980s The 80s represented a huge leap for Princess Auto. 10 new retail stores opened and Powerfist, the first house brand, was introduced. The 80s also showed how new owners, Bob and Larry, believed in a welcoming company culture. The term “employee” had changed to Team Member; and “Managers” were renamed Leaders, stoking the fires of ownership, leadership and integrity within the company. Royal Service was (and still is) a concept that not only dictated, “No sale is final until the customer is completely satisfied”, but also described how the company expected Team Members to treat each other. As sales improved post-recession, Bob and Larry revealed that a portion of Princess Auto’s profits were to be given back to all Team Members. Profit sharing lives on in the business today and continues to reward team members for their dedication. The 1990s Retail expansion continued throughout the 90s, with five new stores added across the country. Princess Auto also diversified their offerings, adding new categories like workshop and garage, truck and trailer, air tools and metal fabrication. In this decade, Bob and the leadership team developed a new program aimed at celebrating diversity, as well as a deferred profit sharing plan that supported Team Members in their retirement. The 2000s In the 2000s, the “Unique World” of Princess Auto officially took shape. The new tagline made it clear that everyone at Princess Auto believed in the spirit of being unique and fun. The buyers couldn’t wait to bring in even more cool products, growing the scope of PA’s unusual product mix. The company introduced an E-Commerce store, allowing customers to connect with Princess Auto in a whole new way. With success came responsibility, and emphasis was soon placed on giving back to the community through the support of trades education. The decade closed with a network of 32 physical stores locations, each full of team members eager to deliver Royal Service. The 2010s The spirit of the decade has been about trying new things, continuing to build relationships, and telling stories that celebrate the history of the company. Ownership of the entire business, including 48 stores across the country, has officially been passed on to Bob’s sons Matt and Marc. E-commerce growth, a new distribution network, and new inventory management systems have helped put products in customer’s hands faster, enhancing their experience with Princess Auto along every step of their journey. Stores As of February 2020, Princess Auto has a total of 48 stores, now located in every province after opening its first Quebec store in St-Jérome, on Sept 17, 2019. For the Quebec stores, the tagline on the storefront is \\"Des idées. Des outils.\\" (Ideas. Tools.).

Like all attack cargo ships, they were designed to carry combat loaded military cargo and landing craft, and to use the latter to land weapons, supplies, and troops on enemy shores during amphibious operations. All these ships were built on the same standard hull design, but there were some differences from ship to ship. The armament varied, as did that of the other ships of the day. During 1944–1945, the 5\\"/38 was recognized as the best gun for the dual role of antiaircraft and naval gunfire support, and the 40 mm was seen as the best antiaircraft gun. The older 20 mm and .50 caliber guns had been recognized to be of limited value, and were being phased out, though they appeared on some of these ships. The 20 mm's were later removed from all of them, but it is not clear just when this happened. The complement varied as well, but the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships figures sometimes seem to confuse ship's company with embarked troops in determining a ship's complement.

Notable wildcatters include Glenn McCarthy, Thomas Baker Slick Sr., Mike Benedum, Joe Trees, Clem S. Clarke, and Columbus Marion Joiner; the last is responsible for finding the East Texas Oil Field in 1930. The term dates from the early oil industry in western Pennsylvania. Oil wells in unproven territory were called \\"wild-cat wells\\" by 1871, and those who drilled them were called \\"wild-catters\\" by 1876.\\"Fortunes flirtations\\", Titusville Herald, 29 Mar. 1871, p.3 c.5.Tionesta (PA) The Forest Republican, 11 Oct. 1876, p.3 c.2.

Herald, 1 March 1880, p. 3. According to tradition, the origin of the term in the petroleum industry comes from Wildcat Hollow, now in Oil Creek State Park near Titusville, Pennsylvania. Wildcat Hollow was one of the many productive fields in the early oil era. A speculator who risked his luck by drilling in this narrow valley shot a wildcat, had it stuffed and set it atop his derrick. The mounted cat gave its name to the hollow. Because the area was largely untested and somewhat away from Oil Creek Flats, the term Wildcatter was coined, describing a person who risked drilling in an unproven area. However, wildcat was American slang for any risky business venture by 1838, long before the rise of the petroleum industry.Christine Ammer.It's Raining Cats and Dogs ... and Other Beastly Expressions (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1989) 152.

Text of Luke 22:43-44 is placed after Matt 26:39. The text of Matthew 16:2b–3 is absent. They are all thought to derive from a lost majuscule Gospel manuscript, probably dating from the 7th century. The group takes its name from minuscule 13, now in Paris. The subscription of manuscript 13 states that Matthew was written in Hebrew eight years after our Lord's Ascension, and contained 2522 and 2560 , Mark was written in Latin ten years after the Ascension with 1675 and 1604 , Luke in Greek fifteen years after with 3803 and 2750 stichoi, and John thirty two years after with 1838 .Eberhard Nestle and Willima Edie, Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the Greek New Testament (London, 1901), pp. 84-85. One of notable examples of Syriac affinity is Matthew 1:16, where Ferrar group has the same reading as Curetonian Syriac.Kenyon F.G., Handbook to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament, London2, 1912, p. 132. The common characteristics of Family 13 were initially identified in a group of four witnesses (minuscules 13, 69, 124, and 346); but the category has subsequently been extended, and some authorities list thirteen family members. Prior to the publication of Reuben Swanson's \\"New Testament Greek Manuscripts\\" in 1995, Swanson misidentified minuscule 1346 to be a member of family 13. The most obvious characteristic of the group is that these manuscripts place John 7:53-8:11 after Luke 21:38, or elsewhere in Luke's Gospel. On the basis of palaeographical analysis, most of the manuscripts in the family (with the exception of Minuscule 69) appear to have been written by scribes trained in Southern Italy.  History  J. J. Wettstein observed close affinity between 13 and 69. The affinity between 124 and 13 was remarked by Treschow and its resemblance to 69 by Andreas Birch. The first published account of Family 13 appeared in the year 1877, in a book published by T. K. Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague (and discoverer of Family 13), William Hugh Ferrar. Before his death, Ferrar collated four minuscules (Greek handwritten cursive texts) to definitively demonstrate that they all shared a common provenance. His work, A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels, would be the first scientific attempt to discover the lost archetype of these four minuscules. The four minuscules Ferrar collated are: * ms. 13 (in the Bibliothèque nationale de France at Paris, France), * ms. 69 (in the Leicestershire County Record Office, Leicester, UK), * ms. 124 (in Vienna, Austria), and * ms. 346 (in the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy). Ferrar transcribed two of these minuscules himself, accepting a previous transcription of 69 done by another person as trustworthy and adequate. He accepted a handmade copy of 124 from the hand of Dr. Ceriani, the Conservator of the Ambrosian Library at the time. The result of his work demonstrates that the members of Family 13 do indeed seem to share a common pattern of deviation from the accepted Greek texts of antiquity. In 1913, Hermann von Soden’s work on the Greek New Testament seemed to confirm the assertion that this family descended from a common archetype. By 1941, Kirsopp and Silva Lake turned their attention to this important family of manuscripts. In their work on the Gospel of Mark entitled Family 13 (The Ferrar Group): The Text According to Mark, the family is characterized as consisting of 10 manuscripts (13, 69, 124, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, and 1689). In this essay, the Lakes thoroughly cover all that was then known about the provenance of each of these manuscripts. Some of the manuscripts proposed as belonging to Family 13 appear to have links to Calabria (mss 13, 124, 174, 230) and one to Albania (ms. 1689); manuscripts 124 and 174 being recorded as having been written in Calabria, and most of the family members recording menologion readings for Calabrian saints. Some family members have common supplemental geographical material that appears to derive from a 7th-century original. In 1961, Jacob Geerlings published three monographs (Matthew, Luke, and John) on the family, although some scholars regard this work as flawed by serious methodological problems. Today, the family supposedly consists of at least fourteen members (13, 69, 124, 174, 230, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, minuscule 1346, 1689, and 1709), although the most recent work of Drs. Barbara Aland, Klaus Wachtel, and others at the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung in Münster, Germany, imply that some of these family members are more similar to the majority Byzantine Text, and therefore should not be included in this family at all. Research recently completed using phylogenetic software by Dr. Jac Perrin (through the auspices of ITSEE - Institute for Textual Scholarship and Electronic Editing at the University of Birmingham, UK) agrees with the conclusions of the Münster team that although the Albanian manuscripts 1141 and 2900 both contain some F13 readings, neither meet the full criteria of F13 membership. In his dissertation on the topic, Perrin lists the current family members as GA 13, 69, 124, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, and 1689. All of these manuscripts (except 1689) are without the Pericope Adulterae in St. John's Gospel. Most of them relocate the passage after Luke 21:38. This agrees with the historical criteria first established by Ferrar-Abbott in their 1887 publication. Perrin lists 590 distinct and significant non-Majority Text readings in St. John's Gospel which identify F13 and contends in his dissertation, that relocation of the PA from John to Luke is an inadequate criterion for F13 filiality. Codex 1709 is held in the national archive at Tirana, Albania; which also holds some 46 other medieval Greek New Testament manuscripts, most of which remained uncollated and unpublished until 2008 - when they were photographed by a team from the Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (Dallas, Texas). A press release from CSNTM in March 2008 reported that \\"one or two\\" of these previously unstudied manuscripts may also belong to family 13; in which case they would be the earliest surviving witnesses to this text. In 1924 Burnett Hillman Streeter proposed that Family 13 should be classified as one branch of a distinct Caesarean text-type, differing in a number of common respects from the then established Byzantine, Western and Alexandrian text-types. This view is supported by some, but not all, subsequent scholars.

He played first- class cricket for Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. A left-handed batsman, he has played for Ireland since 2006, and has captained Ireland at all levels from Under-13 upwards. During Afghanistan T20I series in March 2017, he passed 1,000 runs in T20Is and became the first player for Ireland to do so. In May 2018, he was named as the captain of Ireland's squad for their first ever Test match, against Pakistan. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In July 2019, Porterfield scored his 4,000th run in ODI cricket and recorded his 50th win as captain of Ireland's One Day International team. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis. Later the same month, in the second ODI against the West Indies, Porterfield played in his 300th international match for Ireland. International career On 31 January 2007, he scored his maiden ODI century with an unbeaten 112 to guide his side to victory over Bermuda. He followed it up in his next game with 104 not out against Kenya. In the 2007 World Cup he was man of the match with 85 against Bangladesh during a Super Eight game, which Ireland won. Porterfield scored his maiden first-class century in late August 2007. In a match against Bermuda as part of the 2007–08 ICC Intercontinental Cup, Porterfield scored 166 runs from 326 balls. In the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Porterfield reached a fifty against the Netherlands. He hit 68 off 98 balls and helped his team to victory over the Netherlands. Captaincy Porterfield was appointed Ireland captain at the start of the 2008 season, succeeding Trent Johnston. Porterfield said \\"I've learnt a lot from Trent – he brought young players through, looked after them and he set an example by how he went about his game and how he prepared on and off the field. I may be young but I've plenty of experience of captaincy and I love it, being out there right in the mixer. I was vice-captain under Trent and I filled in when he was off the field so I've had a taste of it\\". Despite being Ireland's official captain, Porterfield chose to represent his county (Gloucestershire) instead of leading Ireland in their ODIs against Scotland and New Zealand in July 2008 in an attempt to secure a permanent position at Gloucestershire. He said \\"It's definitely the hardest decision I've ever had to make ... I feel it's the right decision for me at this stage in my career\\". Porterfield was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all); he eventually won the award. Speaking about the award, Portfield said \\"It's been a fantastic year for us. This award caps it off on a personal note but it's great for the team to be going to the World Cup having won the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier early this year. This award is great for Irish cricket and it shows how much we have done on the field. If we continue onwards and keep on making improvements in that department then other awards will follow.\\" A side made up of some of the best players from Associate and Affiliate teams was put together to face England in Dubai in January 2012. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Porterfield captained the squad and was one of four Ireland players included. 2011 World Cup Porterfield was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup. He led them to a famous victory over England and to narrow defeats to Bangladesh, West Indies and India, as well as hitting the hundredth six of the tournament during the match against hosts India. He captained Ireland to a victory over the Netherlands. Test cricket and beyond In May 2018, Porterfield was named as the captain of a fourteen-man squad for Ireland's first ever Test match, which was played against Pakistan later the same month. He made his Test debut for Ireland, against Pakistan, on 11 May 2018. In January 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for their one-off Test against Afghanistan in India. In July 2019, Porterfield played in his 250th match as captain of Ireland, in the first ODI match against Zimbabwe, at Bready Cricket Club Ground in Magheramason. In the third ODI of the series, Porterfield scored his 4,000th run in ODI cricket. Ireland went on to win the series 3–0, their first clean-sweep in ODIs against a Full Member side. With the victory in the third match, Porterfield recorded his 50th win as captain of Ireland in ODIs. On 10 July 2020, Porterfield was named in Ireland's 21-man squad to travel to England to start training behind closed doors for the ODI series against the England cricket team. Domestic career Between 2004 and 2006, Porterfield played Second XI cricket for Durham, MCC Young Cricketers, Northamptonshire, Derbyshire and Kent.Profile, pcboard.com.pk; accessed 22 March 2015. Porterfield attracted interest from Gloucestershire during the 2007 World Cup and was given a trial with the county in between international commitments. In the 2007 season, Porterfield became the first Irishman to score 1,000 runs in a calendar year, and towards the end of the season Gloucestershire offered him a two-year contract. He guided Ireland to their first victory against a county side in two years against Warwickshire with an innings of 69 from 110 balls. Porterfield was absent from Ireland's last two Friends Provident Trophy matches as he was called into the Gloucestershire squad, Kyle McCallan took over the role of captain. After Gloucestershire batsman Craig Spearman sustained an injury, Porterfield was given the opportunity to play for Gloucestershire opening the batting. He came close to scoring his maiden first-class century for Gloucestershire in a match against Glamorgan County Cricket Club in August 2008 but was out for 93. On 10 September, he and Kadeer Ali shared in Gloucestershire's highest opening partnership of the season; he scored 66. In August 2010, he set a new career best in scoring 175 in the first innings of a County Championship Division Two match between Gloucestershire and Worcestershire at CheltenhamPorterfield hundred end's Gloucestershire's wait, Cricinfo.com; accessed 22 March 2015.

It was released in 1977 as a boxed triple-LP. Created as a concept album, it incorporates a play, with all characters voiced by comedian Peter Cook, and singing by Sarah Vaughan, who was brought into the project by Phonogram after trying to secure Ella Fitzgerald. The album was released in two abbreviated, single-album versions: an eight-track album, Musical Excerpts from Consequences (1977) and a 10-track album, Music from Consequences (1979). A single was also released, \\"Five O'clock in the Morning\\" / \\"The Flood\\". The concept of the album was described at the time as \\"the story of man's last defence against an irate nature\\".  Production  The album began as a demonstration record for the 'Gizmotron', or Gizmo. This was an electric guitar effect device that Godley and Creme had invented a few years earlier as a means of providing orchestral textures, because the band at that stage could not afford to hire orchestral players to augment their recordings. The Gizmo was an electro-mechanical device which was clamped over the bridge of an electric guitar; it contained six small motor-driven toothed plastic wheels that, when pushed into contact with the strings, created a 'bowing' effect, producing notes and chords with endless sustain that, with additional audio effects treatment and overdubbing, could emulate violins, violas, cellos and basses. Godley and Creme had begun work on songs for the Gizmo before leaving 10cc, but quit the band when they realised the songs could not comfortably appear on 10cc albums.\\"Sounds\\" article, 27 November 1976 Kevin Godley interview, \\"Uncut\\", 15 December 1997 The album was recorded over 18 months at Strawberry Studios in Stockport and The Manor in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, with Godley, Creme and engineer Martin Lawrence going to extraordinary lengths to create its special effects. At one point, to create the impression that the listener is inside a coffin during a burial, a binaural \\"head\\" microphone unit was placed behind a board at the foot of a flight of stairs, while Godley shovelled sand on to it. Three days were spent producing a saxophone sound from an electric guitar; each note of a guitar solo was recorded separately and faded in on the track, which was then sent through a speaker and out of a rubber hose with perforated cigarette paper at the end. Enough pressure was displaced by forcing the sound through the holes of the cigarette paper to give the rasp of a saxophone.Article on making of the album, Mr Blint's Attic website  The plot  A website devoted to the album explains that the main action of the play takes place in the office of the increasingly drunken solicitor Mr. Haig; he is negotiating the divorce between Walter Stapleton and his French wife Lulu, represented by Mr. Pepperman. They are continually interrupted by Mr. Blint, an eccentric composer, who lives below; when the building was redeveloped he was the only tenant who refused to sell and a hole remains in Mr. Haig's floor which is, technically, Blint's attic; it is through this hole that Blint addresses them. The litigants are unaware that larger forces are at work; the world is being threatened by a meteorological disaster. Weather is possibly being used as a weapon in a global war, and eventually it dawns on them that only Mr. Blint can save them, with his arcane knowledge of pyramids, music and the number 17.  Critical reaction  The album was first played to the Phonogram/Mercury Records sales force at an elaborate presentation in a domed 17th century church in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with a Scottish MC (Phonogram MD Ken Maliphant) declaring: \\"You may like it, you may loathe it, but you can't afford to ignore... Consequences!\\". It is assumed that a 17th century church was chosen due to the number's significance to the album concept. An account of the Amsterdam presentation observed: Godley has since admitted the pair realised even before its release that the album would be a commercial flop, because of the sudden popularity of punk rock: > \\"There was a seismic, paradigm shift. I knew we were doomed. We emerged > blinking into the light, and everyone was wearing safety pins and bondage > trousers.

Francisco de S. Maspons y Labros in Cuentos Populars Catalans. Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. It is Aarne-Thompson type 425A, the search for the lost husband. Synopsis The fairy tale is about a man who makes his only daughter work very hard. One day after work, he sends her to collect firewood and so she does. While searching for the wood, she picks herself a sprig of rosemary as well. Then a handsome young man appears and asks why she has come to steal his firewood. She replies that her father sent her. The young man leads her to a castle and tells her that he is a great lord and wants to marry her. She agrees so they marry. While living there, she meets an old woman who looks after the castle and the woman gives her the keys but warns her that if she uses one, the castle will fall to pieces. After a time, curiosity overcomes her and she opens a door and finds a snakeskin. Her husband, a magician, uses it to change shape. Because she used the keys, the castle then falls to pieces. The girl cries, breaking off a sprig of rosemary and goes to search for him. She finds a house of straw where the people living there, take her in service. However, she grows sadder by the day. When her mistress asks why, the daughter tells her story, and her mistress sends her to the Sun, the Moon, and the Wind, to ask for help. The Sun can not help her, but gives her a nut and sends her on to the Moon; the Moon can not help her but gives her an almond and sends her on to the Wind; the Wind does not know where her husband is but says he will look. He learns her husband was hidden in the palace of the king and is to marry the king's daughter the next day. The daughter implores him to put it off if he can, and after giving her a walnut, the Wind blows on the tailors sewing for the wedding and destroys their work. The daughter arrives and cracks the nut, finding a fine mantle. She sells it to the princess for a great sum of gold. The almond holds petticoats, which she also sells. The walnut holds a gown, and for this she demands to see the bridegroom. The princess finally agrees, and when she goes in, she touches him with the rosemary which brings his memory back, and they go back to her home. Motifs The unwitting theft is a common motif, but in fairy tales, the usual offender is the father, as in The Singing, Springing Lark or Beauty and the Beast; the motif is found in other folktales, such as the ballads Tam Lin and Hind Etin. Finding the husband can change shape is a common thread in stories of this type, but the discovery that the husband can become a beast is rare; usually, as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon, The Black Bull of Norroway, The Brown Bear of Norway, The Enchanted Snake, and The Enchanted Pig, the bride finds her animal bridegroom is also a man. Furthermore, the usual disaster stems not merely from the discovery but the attempt to break the spell on him—although it is not unique for the violation of the taboo to bring disaster, as in The Tale of the Hoodie. The quest is common to all fairy tales of this type, and the specific motifs of the Sun, the Moon, and the Wind are found in others, such as The Enchanted Pig and The Singing, Springing Lark. In most variants, all the magical treasures are used to bribe the heroine's way to the hero, but the false heroine manages to trick the hero to nullify it, instead of this tale's technique where she actually sells the first two things.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, as St. Mary's Cathedral. History The origins of this church date back to the 1850s when the largely Irish Catholic community in Austin, (originally called \\"Waterloo\\"), built a small stone church named St. Patrick's on the corner of 9th and Brazos Streets. It was built of locally quarried limestone. The parish continued to grow, due in no small part to the increase in German Catholics. In 1866, the parish decided they needed a new church and could afford masonry construction. While the Irish preferred that the church retain the name of St. Patrick, the German residents hoped the new church would be dedicated to a patron saint who reflected their heritage. Both sides compromised and agreed that the new church be named in honor of Mary. In 1872, after Austin was made the permanent capital of the state, the parish laid the cornerstone for a new church choosing a location one block north of the original building.\\"History\\", Saint Mary Cathedral At the time, Austin was part of the Diocese of Galveston. St. Mary's was finished in 1874 and dedicated in 1884. St. Patrick's was demolished around 1874. When the Diocese of Austin was created in 1948, St. Mary's became the cathedral of the newly formed diocese. In recognition of St. Mary's Irish roots, the Celtic Cultural Center of Texas holds an annual Christmas Concert at the Cathedral, highlighting traditional Irish and Scottish music played by noted artists. The show has sold out every year. Architecture The new church was designed by Irish-born architect Nicholas J. Clayton in a Victorian design. It was his first independent commission. In 1872, he was in Galveston working as supervising architect for the construction of the First Presbyterian Church, designed by the Memphis, Tennessee, architects Jones and Baldwin. It may have been through the Holy Cross fathers that the bishop connected Nicholas Clayton with St. Mary's Austin. The neo-Gothic revival towers and spires were completed in 1907. The original finials were removed in the 1950s, perhaps after being struck by lightning.Castillo, Juan. \\"St. Mary Cathedral gets a face-lift\\", American- Statesman, February 2, 2013 Additional stained-glass work was added in the 1890s. The Cathedral's design evokes nature. The tree-like columns have their foliage-carved capitals; the murals contain tracery of vines and leaves. The pointed arches on doors and windows and the spires evoke the mountains. The ceiling and the blue dome spangled with stars reflect the sky and the heavens. The Cathedral's bell, donated by the family of Michael Butler, is one of the largest in the State of Texas.McKaskle, E.D., \\"History\\", Christmas at the Cathedral In 1948, when the church was remodeled, many of its neo-Gothic decorations were removed, the neo-Gothic altars and altar rail were replaced with 20th-century marble and the baldachino with its cactus and bluebonnets, evocative of central Texas. The Cathedral underwent extensive restoration in 2013, due to some safety concerns. This included, among other work, cleaning the exterior, the replacing of some blocks and mortar, and the restoration of the large rose window in the front facade. The window's central design of the quincunx, in which four parts spin out of one, can be interpreted a geometric representation of the four evangelists carrying the Word to the four corners of the world.Clayton, David. \\"A Newly Renovated Rose Window at St Mary's Cathedral, Austin Texas...Almost\\", New Liturgical Movement, August 2, 2013 The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1973.

One of the best-known is a work composed by the Persian author Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm bin Mansūr bin Khalaf of Neyshābūr (a city located in Khorasan, Northeast Iran) the 12th century AD (AH 5th century); another was composed by Muhammad al-Kisai in the 8th century AD (AH 2nd century); others include the Ara'is al-Majalis by al-Tha'labi (d. 1035, AH 427) and the Qasas al-Anbiya by Ibn Kathir (d. 1372, AH 774). The narrations within the Qisas Al-Anbiya, are not about historical accuracy, but rather about wisdom and moral teachings.Itzchak Weismann, Mark Sedgwick, Ulrika Mårtensson Islamic Myths and Memories: Mediators of Globalization Routledge, 6 May 2016 p. 194 Overview Pharaoh watches a serpent devour a demon in the presence of Musa; from a manuscript of Qisas al-Anbiya, c. 1540. Because the lives of biblical figures—the Muslim prophets or anbiya—were covered only briefly in the Qur'an, scholars, poets, historians, and storytellers felt free to elaborate, clothing the bare bones with flesh and blood. Authors of these texts drew on many traditions available to medieval Islamic civilization such as those of Asia, Africa, China, and Europe. Many of these scholars were also authors of commentaries on the Qur'an; unlike Qur'an commentaries, however, which follow the order and structure of the Qur'an itself, the Qiṣaṣ told its stories of the prophets in chronological order - which makes them similar to the Jewish and Christian versions of the Bible. The Qiṣaṣ thus usually begins with the creation of the world and its various creatures including angels, and culminating in Adam. Following the stories of the Prophet Adam and his family come the tales of Idris, Nuh, Shem, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim, Ismail and his mother Hajar, Lut, Ishaq, Yaqub and Esau, Yousuf, Shuaib, Musa and his brother Aaron, Khidr, Joshua, Josephus, Eleazar, Elijah, Samuel, Saul, Dawud, Sulaiman, Yunus, Dhul- Kifl and Dhul-Qarnayn all the way up to and including Yahya and Isa son of Maryam. Sometimes the author incorporated related local folklore or oral traditions, and many of the Qiṣaṣ al-'Anbiyās tales echo medieval Christian and Jewish stories. During the mid-16th century, several gorgeously illuminated versions of the Qiṣaṣ were created by unnamed Ottoman Empire painters. According to Milstein et al., \\"iconographical study [of the texts] reveals ideological programs and cliché typical of the Ottoman polemical discourse with its Shi‘ite rival in Iran, and its Christian neighbors in the West.\\"Stories of the Prophets See also * Biblical and Quranic narratives * Cave of Treasures * History of the Prophets and Kings * History of the Quran * Islamic mythology * List of legends in the Quran * List of biographies of Muhammad * Midrash Rabbah * Prophets and messengers in Islam References Sources * Wheeler, Brannon.

He began his study of Aikido under Gozo Shioda in 1955 and lived at the Yoshinkan Dojo as a professional student (uchideshi) for many years. In 1964 he became a Shihan. While at the Yoshinkan Dojo, Kushida handled many of Shioda's affairs and taught many of the Yoshinkan instructors in place today. Following this period of intense training and instruction, Kushida was made Senior Assistant Instructor at the Yoshinkan. Between 1963 and 1973 he served as Aikido teacher to the Japanese Air Force, the Tokyo Riot Control Police, and National Railway Police. He also accompanied Shiodai in demonstrations in New Zealand and Hawaii as well as teaching at various universities, private companies, and at the Yoshinkan. Move to the US and break from Yoshinkan Kushida left Japan in 1973 after a request was made for an instructor in the Detroit area. In 1976 Kushida founded the Aikido Yoshinkai Association of North America. In 1991, Yoshinkai Aikido in Japan established a group called the International Yoshinkai Aikido Federation (IYAF). Their representatives discussed the mission, policies, and activities of IYAF with Kushida. However, Kushida did not wish to change AYANA's standards to conform with those of the IYAF. Later that December Kushida was dismissed by Shioda and his rank (8th dan) was withdrawn. It was then that Kushida changed AYANA's name to the Aikido Yoshokai Association of North America and began to work independently from Yoshinkai Aikido.

The latter is so named because of the tendency among scholars and enthusiasts of Pictish art to give every Pictish stone a Christian interpretation. In this case, the depiction of a man's head at the jaws of a wolf-like beast is supposed to depict the Old Testament story of Daniel in the Lion's Den. The stones are all of likely Christian origin, and share a similar style with the art of Iona.

Biography Ciampi's parents emigrated from Italy to California in 1906. Guido and Palmira Ciampi travelled on the SS Deutschland from Genoa, arriving at Ellis Island, New York on 3 March 1906.Ellis Island Records They had friends in San Francisco and arrived there just in time for the great San Francisco earthquake of April 18. The devastation caused by the earthquake and subsequent fire forced them to live in an Army issue tent on the Presidio for several months. Mario was born in San Francisco twelve months after the fire, on 27 April 1907. Soon afterwards the family moved to Schellville, California near Sonoma, where Guido became a farmer. The farm had vegetables, fruit trees, animals, and a vineyard which eventually earned bonded winery status. As teenagers, Mario with his brothers Paul and Joe worked on the family vineyard and made extra money making wooden shipping crates for the neighboring Sebastiani Winery.Personal family interview \\"From an early age he precociously sketched buildings for fun, and later seriously for Sonoma Valley friends and neighbors, but there was no money to send him to architecture school. So he entered the profession in the old way -- old-fashioned even in 1925 -- by going straight from high school to an apprenticeship in the San Francisco firm of Alexander Cantin and Dodge A. Riedy, who had worked on the great Pacific Telephone Building with Timothy Pfleuger. \\"Working as a draftsman by day and taking night classes at the San Francisco Architectural Club..., Ciampi soon became a remarkable delineator in the Beaux Arts manner. Like almost all architects of his generation, he was still an eclectic, inspired by historic styles…. \\"Drawings of this quality won him successive scholarships to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he was admitted in 1931 and 1932 as a special student (because he had no bachelor's degree). \\"He returned to San Francisco after a stint at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and an extensive tour of Europe under a traveling fellowship arranged by Harvard.\\" Temko, Allan, San Francisco Chronicle, 22 June 1991 Ciampi founded his design firm, M.J.C. and Associates, in 1945. Professional works of Mario Ciampi include the design and construction of university buildings, schools, churches, and commercial buildings including joint ventures with architectural organizations and collaboration with painters, sculptors and artists. He was commissioned to develop the Downtown Plan for San Francisco in 1963 including beautification of Market Street, Embarcadero, Hallidie, and United Nations Plazas. Much of his work was completed under the administrations of Christopher, Shelley, Alioto, Moscone, and Feinstein. Ciampi was the urban design consultant for the Golden Gateway, Embarcadero Plaza, Rockefeller Center, Fisherman's Wharf, Yerba Buena Center, and freeway study for San Francisco with CAL TRANS. He developed the master plans for the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and St. Mary's College, Moraga.Mario Ciampi's resume of 1998 \\"Probably his most important achievement -- prototypically Modern in its 'rational' elegance -- is the breathtaking series of 'air foil' overpasses and interchanges along Interstate 280 [California] as it winds down the Peninsula. \\"Designed in 1965, after public protest compelled state highway engineers to seek outside help for aesthetics, Ciampi's streamlined concrete structures … transformed a crude preliminary scheme into one of the most gracious freeways in the world.\\"Temko, Allan, San Francisco Chronicle, 22 June 1991 \\"Mario Ciampi, FAIA, architect of the extraordinary Berkeley Art Museum, designed numerous innovative schools in the late 1950s and 1960s. Among them are the Westmoor School, with its precast concrete barrel vaults spanning sixty feet; the Fernando Rivera Elementary School, with a prefabricated wood folded plate roof; and the circular Vista Mar School, all in Daly City; and an elementary school for Ciampi's hometown of Sonoma.

She is best known for her stewardship of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and Savoy Hotel from the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Born in Wigtown, Scotland, she attended the University of London from 1871–74 and pursued brief teaching and acting careers. In 1877 she obtained employment with Richard D'Oyly Carte and became his assistant and, later, business manager. She helped to produce the Gilbert and Sullivan and other Savoy Operas, beginning with The Sorcerer in 1877 and helped Carte with all his business interests. One of her principal assignments was to superintend arrangements for American productions and tours of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Her grasp of detail and her diplomatic skills surpassed even those of her husband. She married Richard in 1888. During the 1890s, with her husband's health declining, Helen assumed increasing responsibility for the businesses, taking full control upon his death in 1901. She remarried in 1902 and continued to own the opera company and run most of the Carte business interests until her death. Although the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's operations decreased after Richard's death, Helen staged successful repertory seasons in London from 1906 to 1908, establishing that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas could continue to be revived profitably. By the time of her death in 1913, the opera company had become a repertory touring company. Helen hired J. M. Gordon to preserve the company's unique style. In her will, she left the Savoy Theatre, the hotel business and the opera company to her stepson, Rupert D'Oyly Carte. Life and career Painting of Helen Carte by Walter Richard Sickert, c. 1885: The Acting Manager Early years Susan Helen Couper Black was born in Wigtown, Scotland, to George Couper Black (1820 – c. 1874), procurator fiscal and banker, and his wife, Ellen, née Barham (1823 – after 1877), the second of four siblings. One of her brothers, John McConnell Black, became a well-known botanist. Her grandfather, Robert Couper, M.D., was a Scottish physician and poet,Seeley, p. 17 and a great uncle was Sir George Couper.Desprez, Frank. \\"The Late Mrs. D'Oyly Carte\\", The Era, 10 May 1913, p. 19 From 1871–1874, registered as Helen Susan Black, she attended the University of London and was a gifted student, passing the examinations for Special Certificates in mathematics and in logic and moral philosophy (the university did not award degrees to women until 1878).Stedman, Jane W. \\"Carte, Helen (1852–1913)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, ; accessed 12 September 2008\\"University\\", Historic England, accessed 27 August 2020 She also spoke several languages. After her studies, she supported herself by coaching students for examinations. She contemplated an acting career and took lessons in elocution, dancing and singing. Her first or second engagement was a two-month spell as a chorister and small part player in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin in the 1876 Christmas season.Seeley, p. 22 She adopted the stage name Helen Lenoir, which, she later explained, had been the surname of her French ancestors until they anglicised it to Black on settling in Scotland in the 18th century. In February 1877 she travelled to London to audition for Richard D'Oyly Carte, who was setting up a provincial tour of a French farce adapted under the title The Great Divorce Case. He engaged her for a small role, which she played in Liverpool and other cities, before leaving the tour after a few weeks and obtaining work in Carte's entertainment agency offices in London. She was soon assisting Richard D'Oyly Carte with the production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer at the Opera Comique. The woman behind the man From the time that she became a secretary in Richard's agency in June 1877, Helen was intensely involved in his business affairs and had a grasp of detail and organisational and diplomacy skills that surpassed even Carte's.Ainger, pp. 111–12 Frank Desprez, the editor of The Era, wrote, \\"Her character exactly compensated for the deficiencies in his.\\" She eventually became the business manager of the company and was later responsible for the Savoy Hotel, into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts. One of Helen's early tasks was to produce the British copyright performance of The Pirates of Penzance in Paignton. She made seventeen visits to America to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and American lecture tours of artistes managed by Carte, as well as supervising many of Carte's British touring companies. She also assisted in arranging American lecture tours for Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold and others. Helen, more than anyone else, was able to smooth out the differences between W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, in the 1880s, to ensure that the two produced more operas together.Jacobs, Arthur. \\"Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, She also tactfully and sympathetically dealt with the personal and professional problems of the actors in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company casts. Desprez wrote in her obituary, \\"She never took advantage of anybody; but I never heard of her letting anybody take advantage of her.\\" Helen Carte, c. 1885, from The Sketch, 1901 In 1886, Carte raised Helen's salary to £1,000 a year plus a 10% commission on the net profits of all business at his theatres. According to historian Jane Stedman, \\"When she demurred, he wrote, 'You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I could not have done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you'\\". Carte's first wife had died in 1885, and Helen married Richard on 12 April 1888 in the Savoy Chapel, with Sir Arthur Sullivan acting as Carte's best man.Goodman, Andrew. Gilbert and Sullivan's London (1988; 2000), Faber & Faber; The couple's London home included the first private elevator. James McNeill Whistler, a client of Carte's agency and friend of the Cartes, made an etching of Helen in 1887 or 1888, \\"Miss Lenoir\\", and later helped to decorate the Cartes' home. Although some sources refer to Mrs. Carte as \\"Helen D'Oyly Carte\\", this is incorrect, as D'Oyly was a given name, not a surname. Her married name was Helen Carte. Throughout the 1890s, Richard's health was declining, and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company and other family businesses. In his 1922 memoir, Henry Lytton described Helen Carte as follows: :\\"She was a born business woman with an outstanding gift for organisation. No financial statement was too intricate for her, and no contract too abstruse. Once, when I had to put one of her letters to me before my legal adviser ... he declared firmly 'this letter must have been written by a solicitor.' He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications. Mrs. Carte, besides her natural business talent, had fine artistic taste and was a sound judge, too, of the capabilities of those who came to the theatre in search of engagements\\".Lytton, Henry. Secrets of a Savoyard (1922), chapter 4 In 1894, Carte hired his son Rupert D'Oyly Carte as an assistant. Rupert's older brother, Lucas (1872–1907), a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis at the age of 34.Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, The Times, 22 January 1907, p. 12 With no new Gilbert and Sullivan shows written after 1896, the Savoy Theatre put on a number of other shows for comparatively short runs, including several of Sullivan's less successful operas. Young Rupert assisted Helen and W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy in May 1897.New York Post, 7 January 1948 In 1899, the theatre finally had a new success in Sullivan and Basil Hood's The Rose of Persia.Wearing, p. 844; and Gordon-Powell, Robin. Notes to programme for Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival Concert, 16 September 2006, London After Carte's death Helen with Rutland Barrington, c. 1908 Richard died in 1901 leaving the theatre, opera company and hotel business to Helen, who assumed full control of the family businesses.Joseph, p. 133 She leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet in 1901. She oversaw his management of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival at the Savoy of Iolanthe, and several new comic operas including The Emerald Isle (1901; Sullivan and Edward German, with a libretto by Basil Hood), Merrie England (1902) and A Princess of Kensington (1903; both by German and Hood). The last of these ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured. When A Princess closed at the Savoy, Greet terminated his lease,The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times, 11 July 1903 and Helen leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906. She had married Stanley Boulter, a barrister, in 1902, but she continued to use the surname Carte in her business dealings. Boulter assisted her in the Savoy businesses. She was a founder member of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, along with Frank Curzon, George Edwardes, Arthur Bourchier and sixteen others.\\"The Society of West-End Theatre Managers\\", The Times, 24 April 1908, pg. 17. Her stepson Rupert took over his late father's role as Chairman of the Savoy Hotel in 1903, which Helen continued to own. The years between 1901 and 1906 saw a decline in the fortunes of the opera company. The number of D'Oyly Carte repertory companies touring the provinces gradually declined until there was only one left, visiting often small centres of population. After the company visited South Africa in 1905, more than half a year elapsed with no professional productions of G&S; in the British Isles. During this period, Helen and Rupert focused their attention on the hotel side of the family interests, which were very profitable. In late 1906, Helen re- acquired the performing rights to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas from Gilbert (she already had those of Sullivan) and staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, reviving the opera company and leasing the Savoy to herself. She persuaded the recently knighted Gilbert, now 71, to stage direct the productions in repertory, and once again she had to exercise the greatest tact, as Gilbert sometimes had difficulty accepting that he was no longer an equal partner and was taking no financial risk. Gilbert was angry that he had not been consulted regarding casting of the productions.Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan, Vista Books, London, 1962. The season, and the following one, were tremendous successes, revitalising the company. Contemporary accounts describe her taking three curtain calls with Gilbert on the opening night of the 1906 revival of The Yeomen of the Guard. Planter in Embankment gardens behind the Savoy Hotel After the repertory seasons in 1906–08 the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time. Carte wrote in 1911 that her health made it impossible for her to produce any more revivals at the Savoy. In March 1909, Charles H. Workman assumed management of the Savoy Theatre from the now frail Helen Carte Boulter. She continued to manage the rest of the family businesses with the assistance of Rupert. In 1911, the company hired J. M. Gordon, who had been a member of the company under Gilbert's direction, as stage manager. Carte was so generous that King George V granted to her the Order of the League of Mercy in 1912. After another illness lasting several months, Helen died of a cerebral haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis in 1913, a week before her 61st birthday. A private funeral was held at Golders Green crematorium. In her will, she left the Savoy Theatre, the opera company and the hotel business to Rupert, bequests of £5,000 to each of her two brothers and smaller bequests to a number of friends and colleagues. She left the considerable residuary estate to her husband.The Times, 6 May 1913, p. 11, reporting on \\"Probated Will of Helen Boulter\\" The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to operate continuously until 1982.Skow, John. \\"Final Curtain for D'Oyly Carte\\", Time magazine, 8 March 1982.

The film co-stars Cliff DeYoung and Glenn Quinn. It was released on October 23, 1992.The New York Times Plot In the town of Moorehigh in 1957, the patients of Dr. Evan Rendell kept disappearing. The townspeople found out the father and son duo had been ripping out the patients' hearts — in an attempt to bring back the doctor's dead wife. The townspeople stoned Dr. Rendell to death, but Evan Jr. disappeared. Thirty-five years later, the adult Evan Jr. (now nicknamed \\"Dr. Giggles\\" for his hideous laugh and insatiable obsession to follow in his father's footsteps) escapes from a mental asylum, killing everyone in his path. In Moorehigh, 19-year-old Jennifer Campbell, her boyfriend Max Anderson, and their friends are planning their summer break. Jennifer, already upset by family trouble, is further distressed from having a heart condition and being forced to wear a heart monitor. Dr. Giggles returns to his childhood home, goes through Evan Sr.'s files, and gathers a list of names. He begins stalking and killing several residents, including Jennifer's friends. After the party, Jennifer becomes fed up with her heart monitor and dumps it in a fish tank. Jennifer's father finds it and leaves to look for her. Dr. Giggles shows up and kills his girlfriend. Jennifer returns to the party and sees Max kissing another girl. Distraught, she runs into the house of mirrors. Dr. Giggles notices Jennifer has the same heart condition as his mother and goes after her. He kills the girl Max was kissing, but Jennifer sees him coming and escapes. Officers Magruder and Reitz find her and take her to the police station. Officer Magruder explains to Reitz how Evan Jr. escaped. He was on guard duty at the morgue housing the bodies of Dr. Rendell and his wife. Investigating a giggle, he witnessed Evan Jr. cutting his way out of his mother's body with a scalpel. He realized that Rendell had cut open his wife's body, stuffed his son in and sewn it shut. Upon being threatened by Evan Jr., Macgruder passed out from shock. When he woke up, Rendell's wive's corpse had been re-sewn, and all traces of the event at the morgue had been wiped clean. The experience has left Magruder an alcoholic and an insomniac. Dr. Giggles makes his way to Jennifer's house and attacks her father. Officer Magruder goes to investigate Jennifer's house and finds her father there, lying in a pool of blood. Dr. Giggles mortally wounds Magruder who, recognizing Evan Jr., shoots and wounds him before dying. Reitz arrives soon after, finding his partner dead and Jennifer's father wounded but alive. Meanwhile, Dr. Giggles returns to his hideout, performing surgery on himself to remove the bullet. He kidnaps Jennifer and tells her his plan to replace her \\"broken\\" heart with one he took from her friends. Reitz and Max arrive. While Reitz distracts Dr. Giggles, Max and Jennifer escape. Dr. Giggles kills Reitz, but his father's house explodes and collapses on him. At the hospital, Jennifer learns that the events of the evening have damaged her heart, requiring immediate surgery. While she is being prepped, Dr. Giggles reappears and cuts a bloody path through the hospital staff. He chases her to a janitor's closet. Jennifer ambushes and finally kills Dr. Giggles with his own instruments. Before dying, Dr. Giggles breaks the fourth wall, staring at the camera and asking, \\"Is there a doctor in the house?\\". Recovering in the hospital, Jennifer is visited by Max and her father. Cast Production On 11 August 1992, the Daily Variety reported that Largo Entertainment signed an exclusive first-look deal with Dark Horse Comics to develop and produce films based on the company's and comic and franchies. Dr. Giggles was the first film produced as part of the deal between Largo and Dark Horse. The house that appears in Dr. Giggles was built in Metzger Park in the unincorporated community of Metzger, Oregon. Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers covered the song Bad Case of Lovin' You for the soundtrack. Release Dr Giggles was the first film distributed by Universal Pictures through its distribution deal with Largo. Universal would handle domestic distribution and release the film in all territories except for Japan and Italy. The film premiered in Los Angeles and New York on 23 October 1992. The original release was on October 23, 1992 and the re-release on December 12, 2009 at New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. Following writing and directing Dr.Giggles, Coto created some more original stories about the character for a then upcoming comic-book series from Dark Horse. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Dr. Giggles holds an approval rating of 17%, based on 29 reviews, and an average rating of 3.46/10. It's consensus reads, \\"Larry Drake's deranged performance as the titular doctor is just about all that distinguishes Dr. Giggles from its slasher brethren.\\" Variety gave the film a negative review, calling it a \\"wildly uneven horror film,\\" noting that \\"More care in scripting and fewer cheap yocks could have resulted in a viable new paranoid horror myth.\\" Vincent Canby also criticized the script in his review for The New York Times, stating, \\"The screenplay is stitched together from variations on cliches used by or about the medical community.\\" The Washington Post noted that \\"Manny Coto turns to co-writer Graeme Whifler time and again for punchlines in a desperate attempt to revive a script that begins in critical condition and ends up DOA.\\" Sight & Sound noted that the films satire \\"gives way to a few nicely nasty moments\\" but that the film never tops the visual flair of the opening credits. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale.

It was succeeded as Icelandic representative at the 2004 contest by Jónsi with Heaven. A version of the song in Icelandic \\"Segðu Mér Allt\\" (English: \\"Tell Me Everything\\") was also recorded. This version uses a slightly different production and is 14 seconds longer than the Eurovision version. The press information pack which was distributed to reporters featured performable lyrics in French, German and Spanish, however these were not recorded by Birgitta mainly because she can not speak them.

The magazine is based in Birmingham, Alabama. History Founded in Winston, North Carolina, in 1886 by North Carolina native Leonidas Lafayette Polk (1837–1892; a Confederate Army veteran who is often confused with CSA General Leonidas Polk, no relation), the publication was intended to bring the latest information on crop and livestock production to the reunited nation's agrarian economy in the Southeast. After Polk died in 1892, Clarence H. Poe from Raleigh, NC, took over as editor in 1899, and in 1903, he and three partners purchased the publication, taking it from a newspaper to a magazine with 36,000 subscribers by 1908. One of the most notable achievements of the magazine was its continual crusade and endorsement during the early twentieth century of the land grant college subsidies provided to Agricultural and Mechanical colleges across the United States. The magazine designates an annual \\"Man of the Year\\" award. Merger with Southern Farm Gazette The magazine broadened its reach beyond the Southeast by merging its Raleigh, North Carolina, operation with the Southern Farm Gazette newspaper published in Starkville, Mississippi. This was a major innovation in publishing at the time. Merging these two farm publications established the first publication in history to publish regional editorial specific to its circulation areas. This merger of the Progressive Farmer and the Southern Farm Gazette resulted in the need to have a production and printing facility that would be a one-day train trip to both of the editorial offices in Starkville and Raleigh, North Carolina, for receiving the typewritten feature stories for publication. In 1911, it was decided to establish a central office in Birmingham, while Clarence Poe and his partners remained in Raleigh and directed company operations from there. In 1932, Cully Cobb of Atlanta, Georgia, sold his Southern Ruralist magazine to Progressive Farmer. Cobb served for a year as the managing editor of the Georgia-Alabama edition of Progressive Farmer. In 1933, however, he accepted an appointment in Washington, D.C., in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration as director of the Cotton Division of the New Deal agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. The Progressive Farmer Company continued to publish across the Southeastern and Mid-south regions soon expanding successfully into Texas and the Southwest. Serving farm information needs, publishing through two world wars, crusading for important rural farm issues such as rural electrification, soil conservation, rural education and modern agricultural technology, the magazine soared to a circulation high of 1.3 million by the 1960s. Launch of Southern Living In 1966, the management, led by Emory Cunningham and the editors of Progressive Farmer launched Southern Living magazine fashioned after the lifestyle and home life section in the magazine. The Progressive Farmer had extended its appeal among suburban housewives, and that segment of its circulation received the new magazine, Southern Living to establish its distribution and advertising rate base. From the pages of Progressive Farmer rose the largest and most successful regional publication in history. Consequently, Progressive Farmer was able to editorially focus more completely on production agriculture and concentrate circulation efforts to the rural farm household. The launch of Southern Living was an outstanding strategic move for the Progressive Farmer Company. Midwest expansion In 1980, the Progressive Farmer Company changed its name to Southern Progress Corporation in an effort to reflect its wider focus. In the early 1980s the editors of Progressive Farmer began a regional edition of Progressive Farmer in the twelve Midwestern states. It was distinctively different from the main Southern issue and was used to establish a circulation and advertising foothold in the Midwest. In 1985, Southern Progress Corporation was purchased by Time Inc. for $498 million. By the end of the decade, Progressive Farmer Midwest was incorporated into the main edition's editorial and circulation making Progressive Farmer a nationwide production agricultural and lifestyle publication with a circulation of over 700,000. During the 1990s Progressive Farmer enjoyed prominence among farm readers and advertisers with special editorial efforts in farm safety and rural recreation blended with production agricultural reporting. New ownership In 2007, after 130 years of publishing under the company it founded, Southern Progress Corporation, a division of Time-Warner, announced it had sold the Progressive Farmer magazine, circulation 620,000, to a former advertiser, DTN, based in Omaha, Nebraska. It was announced by DTN that Progressive Farmer would continue to be headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. DTN was acquired by Telvent in 2008. In 2017, Schneider Electric, which had acquired Telvent in 2011, sold it to Swiss investment group TBG. References Further reading * Lauder, Tracy.

The newspaper has its roots in five predecessors, beginning with the Waco Evening Telephone in 1892. The Tribune-Herald took its current identity when E.S. Fentress and Charles Marsh, who owned the Waco News-Tribune, bought the Waco Times-Herald. That purchase was the beginning of Newspapers, Inc., a chain which eventually owned 13 newspapers. The newspapers stayed in the Fentress family until 1976, when they were sold to Cox Newspapers, which continued to own the chain until 2009, when Waco businessman Clifton Robinson bought the paper. In 2012, Robinson sold the newspaper to Berkshire Hathaway. The Tribune-Herald is best known for a series of stories in February and March 1993 about the Branch Davidian sect which was headquartered in a compound in Mount Carmel, near Waco. The series reported that leader Vernon Howell, later known as David Koresh, had turned the group into a cult, engaged in polygamy, abused children living in the compound, and was amassing an arsenal of weapons. The Tribune-Herald had been reporting on a number of issues about the compound in the months before the series. Federal authorities asked managing editor Barbara Elmore to hold off on the series, but she refused, and the first of seven parts was published on February 27, 1993. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was planning a raid on the compound on March 1, with warrants for Koresh and several followers, but the raid was moved up a day in response to the Tribune-Herald series. The raid turned deadly, as the Davidians were tipped off early and were expecting the federal agents. A shootout occurred, leading to a 51-day siege that ended in an attack on the compound, which resulted in its fiery destruction that was seen live by television viewers around the world. Waco Today Magazine The paper also publishes a monthly lifestyle magazine. Each issue focuses on a specific issue like weddings, remodeling or dining out for the Waco area.

The Kherson Governorate (1802–1922) (, translit.: Khersonskaya guberniya; , translit.: Khersons\`ka huberniya) or Government of Kherson was a guberniya, or administrative territorial unit, between the Dnieper and Dniester Rivers, of the Russian Empire. It was one of three governorates created in 1802 when the Novorossiya guberniya was abolished. It was known as the Nikolayev Governorate until 1803, when Kherson replaced Nikolayev as the governorate's capital. The economy of the governorate was mainly based on agriculture. During the grain harvest, thousands of agricultural laborers from the parts of the Empire found work in the area. The industrial part of the economy, consisting primarily of flour milling, distilling, metalworking industry, iron mining, beet-sugar processing, and brick industry, was underdeveloped. Administrative divisions The governorate bordered Bessarabia Governorate to the west, with Kiev and Poltava Governorates to the north, to the east could be found Yekaterinoslav Governorate, and in the southward direction was located Taurida Governorate. From 1809, the governorate consisted of five uyezds: Khersonsky Uyezd, Aleksandriysky Uyezd, Ovidiopol, Tiraspolsky Uyezd, and Yelisavetgradsky Uyezd. The city of Odessa carried a special status. In 1825, Odessky Uyezd and in 1834, Ananyevsky Uyezd were added into the territorial division of the Kherson Governorate. A seventh uyezd — Bobrynets, existed from 1828 to 1865. The cities of Odessa and Nikolayev (in 1803–1861) and their surrounding vicinity were governed separately: Odessa by a gradonachalnik (), answerable directly to the tsar and (from 1822) the governor-general of Novorossiya and Bessarabia, and Nikolayev by a military governor. In 1920, while being under Soviet Ukrainian rule, the governorate's territory, , was divided to form the newer Odessa Governorate. The Kherson Governorate was renamed Mykolaiv Governorate in 1921, and in 1922 - merged with the Odessa Governorate. In 1925, the Odessa Governorate was abolished, and its territory was divided into six okruhas: Kherson, Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Pershotravneve, and Zinoviivske. In 1932, much of this territory was incorporated into the new Odessa Oblast, now an administrative division of the modern Ukrainian nation, which was divided to form the Mykolaiv Oblast.

The gubernia had a population of about 245,000 in 1812; 893,000 in 1851; 1,330,000 in 1863; 2,027,000 in 1885; 2,733,600 in 1897; and 3,744,600 in 1914. In the 1850s it consisted of Ukrainians (68–75 %), Romanians (8–11 %), Russians (3–7 %), Jews (6 %), Germans (4 %), Bulgarians (2 %), Poles, Greeks, and Gypsies. In 1914, Ukrainians composed only 53% of the population, while Russians made up 22% and Jews - 12%. Urban dwellers made up 10 to 20 percent of the population until the 1850s, after which the proportion of urban dwellers increased, to about 30% in 1897. Migration within the Russian Empire mainly accounted for the area's population growth, with 46% of the population born outside of the governorate in 1897.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14770 on 2020-05-24 Morphology Shell Stromboideans have medium to large shells, attaining a wide variety of lengths depending on the species (20–400 mm from the smallest aporrhaids to the largest strombids). A stromboidean shell has a medium (e.g. spider conchs, Lambis spp.) to high spire (e.g. tibias, Tibia spp.), and a thickened and frequently expanded outer lip (e.g. the queen conch, Lobatus gigas, or the goliath conch, Lobatus goliath) that may be ornamented by long spines (e.g. the spider conch, Lambis chiragra, common pelican foot, Aporrhais spp.) or digitations (e.g. the millipede spider conch, Lambis millepeda). The anterior portion of the outer lip may present a stromboid notch, an indentation through which one of the animal's long eyestalks may protrude. The shell morphology of some stromboideans (e.g. Lobatus gigas) is not solely determined by the animal's genes; environmental conditions such as location, diet, temperature and depth, and biological interactions such as predation, can greatly affect it.Tewfik, A.

Prior to the recent ruling by the ICZN, many invertebrate superfamily names ended in the suffix -acea, or -aceae, not -oidea as now required according to ICZN article 29.2. The suffix -oidea used to be used for some subclasses and superorders, where it is still found. In much of the older literature including Keen 1958, Moore and colleagues 1952, and the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, gastropod superfamilies are written with the suffix -acea.Keen A. M.

The author proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae. In his analysis, Simone recognized Strombidae as a monophyletic taxon supported by 13 synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor), with at least eight distinct genera. He considered the genus Terebellum as the most basal taxon, distinguished from the remaining strombids by 13 synapomorphies, including a rounded foot. Though the genus Tibia was left out of the analysis, Simone regarded it as probably closely related to Terebellum, apparently due to some well known morphological similarities between them. Ecology and behavior Stromboideans are exclusively marine, and most species inhabit shallow waters. Adult individuals may be epifaunal, remaining partially buried in the sand or never burying at all (e.g. Strombidae), but may also be infaunal, remaining buried for most of their lifetime (Struthiolariidae). Feeding habits Herbivory is the most common feeding habit among stromboideans. Snails in the family Strombidae were widely accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, a concept that persisted until the first half of the 20th century. This erroneous idea evidently originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Nowadays, strombids are known to be specialized herbivores and occasional detritivores. They are usually associated with shallow water reefs and seagrass meadows. Struthiolariids are ciliary mucous feeders, obtaining their nutrition from particles and organic matter suspended in the water. While remaining completely buried in the sand, struthiolariids are connected to the surface by two artificially produced holes. These holes are made by the animal's proboscis, held in place with mucus, and are used for inhalating and exhalating water. Feeding particles are captured as the inhaled water flows over the animal's gills, become embedded in mucus, and are moved along a ciliary tract that leads to the animal's mouth, where they are finally ingested.

The protagonist's name and film title come both from a passage in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13: \\"Now we see through a glass, darkly...\\". For the film Ridley was awarded the Best Director Prize at the Porto Film festival.  Plot  Darkly Noon (Brendan Fraser), whose name comes from a Bible passage, is a young man who has spent his entire life as a member of an ultraconservative Christian cult. After a violent incident in which the cult is dissolved and Darkly's parents die, a disoriented Darkly wanders into a forest in the Appalachian region of North Carolina. He is rescued from exhaustion by a coffin transporter named Jude (Loren Dean) and his friend Callie (Ashley Judd). Jude leaves Darkly in Callie's care. As Callie nurses him back to health, Darkly becomes frustrated by the conflict between his religious past and his attraction to his new companion. His frustration intensifies when Clay (Viggo Mortensen), Callie's mute boyfriend, who builds the coffins Jude sells, returns home after being away for a few days. Darkly's inner turmoil further builds after he encounters Clay's mother, Roxy (Grace Zabriskie), who despises the relationship between Clay and Callie. Roxy tells Darkly that she believes that Callie is a witch bent on destroying Roxy's family. Despite his detached behavior, Darkly becomes good friends with Jude. One day, Darkly discovers a bizarre giant shoe on the river, and when Roxy's dog dies, they place the body in the shoe and set it on fire as a floating funeral pyre. Jude proposes that he and Darkly move away to live together. Darkly agrees, and Jude leaves with plans to return for Darkly. Overcome with loneliness, Roxy commits suicide. After finding Roxy's body, Darkly hallucinates that his dead parents are telling him to kill Callie. Now thoroughly unhinged, Darkly wraps himself in barbed wire, paints himself red, and arms himself with one of Clay's chisels. He bursts into Callie and Clay's house, intent on murdering the couple, whom he discovers having sex. During the horrific attack, a fire starts, which quickly burns down the house. Jude arrives and sees the inferno. Rifle in hand, Jude enters to rescue Callie and Clay. When Callie tells Darkly that she loves him, Darkly hesitates, giving Jude the opportunity to shoot him. \\"Who will love me now?\\" are Darkly's last words as he dies in Callie's arms. The next morning, while Callie, Clay, and Jude view the ruins of the house, a family of circus people arrive. They claim to have lost all their supplies and ask if anyone had seen their giant shoe. The group decides to go for help together. One of the children gives Callie a shoe which resembles the giant shoe.  Cast  * Brendan Fraser... Darkly Noon * Ashley Judd... Callie * Viggo Mortensen...

Roxy  Critical reception  Entertainment Weekly called The Passion of Darkly Noon \\"an unintended comedy with a scorcher of an ending\\", citing poor acting, over- the-top dialogue and implausible plot twists. Conversely, Fangoria magazine praised the film, citing especially the performance of Brendan Fraser. Leading UK film critic Mark Kermode has raved about the film calling it \\"One of my favourite cinematic experiences of recent years\\" and also citing it as \\"[Ridley's] great unsung work.\\" Like Ridley's previous film The Reflecting Skin it has developed a cult following and in 2014 made the top 10 in The Daily Telegraph's list of the 50 most underrated films of all time.

The school opened in 1969 as Don Head Secondary School and was renamed Alexander Mackenzie High School in 1992, in honour of Major Addison Alexander Mackenzie, a Richmond Hill resident and philanthropist. It was announced in October 2008 that AMHS will join Huron Heights S.S., Unionville High School, and Westmount Collegiate as one of the four high schools in York Region to offer a specialized arts program. This program is known as ARTS Mackenzie and encompasses dance, theatre arts, music and visual arts. In 2017, AMHS, along with G.W. Williams SS, Maple HS, Miliken Mills HS, joined Bayview SS as the board's IB schools. Facilities The original school building was built in 1969 and in 1992 a new wing was added in order to accommodate both the increase in student population and the change in school program. A second addition of 10 classrooms opened in the spring of 2002. The school has two gyms, one larger than the other. The school also has three music rooms, one for vocals, one for strings, and another for band. Character Matters In 2003, the Town of Richmond Hill contributed 10 \\"Character Matters\\" signs to the school as part of an initiative that encourages young adults to become more involved in their community. This event featured guest speaker Wendel Clark, the former Toronto Maple Leafs Captain. Departments Dance ARTS Mackenzie's dance program is one of the four programs available in the arts program. The dance department has two open-spaced dance studios on the first and second floors, as well as several performance opportunities at the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts. English Alexander Mackenzie High School offers English courses in all grades as well as a Writer's Craft course. Theatre Arts As part of the Theatre Arts Mackenzie program, students take four years of drama classes and are taught by artists and professionals who have been in the film or stage industry. Guest speakers, such as local Toronto playwrights and actors as well as guests from the Stratford Festival, are brought in for workshops, such as film acting and stage combat. Students are also given opportunities to expand their portfolios through class assignments, local festivals such as The Ontario Drama Festival, and exposure to new forms of stage and film. Mathematics Alexander Mackenzie High School offers math in all grades. It also offers opportunities for students to write different math contests, such as Waterloo Math Contest and American Math Competition.

Born at the manor of Fenny Compton in Warwickshire, England, to Richard and Hester (Chambers) Willis, part of an old, wealthy family. He attended several universities, \\"but biographers make no mention of him graduating,\\" according to an online biographical sketch of Wyllys at the Connecticut State Library and Museum Web site.\\"George Wyllys: Governor of the Colony of Connecticut 1642\\" at website of the Connecticut State Library, a biographical sketch prepared by the library's History and Genealogy Unit, April 1999 He may well have become a Puritan in his university years. He married Bridget Yonge/Young on 2 November 1609 at the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-on-Avon. They had three children before she died in 1629. In 1631 he married again, this time to Mrs. Mary Brisbey. They had one son. The family emigrated to New England in the early 1630s. By 1634, Wyllys had been appointed an Assistant to the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1636, Wyllys sent his steward, William Gibbons, to Hartford along with 20 domestics and indentured servants in order to buy land and oversee construction of a house. That house was the largest home of any of Hartford's early settlers and one of the largest in Connecticut. The famous Charter Oak stood on the property. The same street contained the homes of future Governors Wyllys, Webster, Welles, and Hopkins and was called Governor Street until, much later, its name was changed to Popieluszko Court. It was not until 1638 that the Wyllys family arrived in Hartford. He was soon elected as one of six Assistants to the General Court in 1639-41. He became deputy governor of the colony in 1641 and in 1642 he served a year as governor. In 1643 and 1644 he again served as an Assistant to the General Court. Rumors that the Narragansetts would form an alliance with several other tribes to destroy the English settlers prompted Wyllys and the General Court to send two delegates to a meeting in Boston which later resulted in the Articles of Confederation between the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, New Haven, and Connecticut, a compact to provide cooperation in defense of the colonies. In December 1642, the General Court passed the colony's first penal code, which named 12 capital crimes. After his term as governor expired, Wyllys was chosen to be a Commissioner from Connecticut to The United Colonies of New England in 1643. On his death in Hartford on March 9, 1644/5, his estate, which included slaves, was the largest in the colony until 1680. No portrait of him is known to exist. Wyllys' home in Hartford was torn down in 1827. He is buried in the Hartford's Ancient Burying Ground, and his name appears on the Founders Monument. Wyllys Street in Hartford is named after him. One of his direct descendants was Frank Lloyd Wright.

Professor Liu discovered optimized design theory about the 3D cascade and runner, combined with optimized cybernetics. He developed a field change and variation theory and a finite element method in which various unknown interfaces can be automatically captured. He also put forward a series of new general functions for hydromechanics, and explored general theory and solution about mapping space of 3D flow reverse - cross proposition. In the last few decades, Liu has emphasized new directions, such as reverse proposition of nonsteady pneumatic mechanics, reverse proposition of multi-working condition points hydromechanics and pneumatic - thermal - elastic coupling theory.

It is on the southern fringe of the North York Moors, north-east of Kirkbymoorside, and to the east of Hutton-le-Hole. It was home to the early missionaries to the Angles, St. Cedd and his brother, St. Chad. At the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 96, increasing to 233 (including Spaunton) at the 2011 Census. It is in the historic North Riding of Yorkshire. History There is reason to believe that the original name for Lastingham was Læstingau. Læstingau first appears in history when King Ethelwald of Deira (651-c.655) founded a monastery for his own burial. Bede attributes the initiative to Ethelwald's chaplain Caelin, brother of Cedd, Chad and Cynibil. Bede records that Cedd and Cynibil consecrated the site, and that Cynibil built it of wood. Cedd ruled the monastery as the first abbot until his death, combining this position with that of missionary bishop to the East Saxons. In 664, shortly after the Synod of Whitby, in which he was a key participant, St. Cedd died of the plague at Læstingau. Bede records that a party of monks from Essex came to mourn him and all but one were all wiped out by the plague. Cedd was first buried outside the wooden monastery but, at some time between 664 and 732, a stone church was erected, and his body was translated to the right side of the altar. The crypt of the present parish church remains a focus for veneration of Cedd.This crypt is generally held to be the only complete crypt in the U.K., containing a central aisle, two side aisles, and an apse. His brother St. Chad took his place as abbot.Bede: Historia Ecclesiastica, iii, 25. Not much is known of this house, though all who spoke of it spoke well. Perhaps the best indication of its standards is that, in 687, one of its graduates, Trumbert, transferred to Wearmouth-Jarrow and became scriptural tutor to a youthful Bede.Bede: Historia Ecclesiastica, iv, 3. The altar in Lastingham crypt It is not known what became of the original Anglo-Saxon structure. Destruction by the Danes is nowhere attested, and seems to be entirely the product of modern conjecture. An attempt was made to rebuild the monastery in 1078, when St. Stephen, prior of Whitby, and a band of monks moved from Whitby due to a disagreement with William de Percy, who was abbot of Whitby at the time.Simeon of Durham: Historia Regum Angliae (part two) @ 1074 They received support from King William I and Berenger de Todeni in the form of one carucate of land in Lastingham, six carucates at Spaunton, and other lands in Kirkby.

Ficker ran for Montgomery County Executive in the 2018 election. Early life and education Ficker was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, attended Takoma Park Elementary, and graduated from Montgomery Blair High School. Ficker attended the United States Military Academy for five semesters. He received a B.S. in electrical and mechanical engineering from Case Western Reserve University. Ficker attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School, receiving his JD from the University of Baltimore School of Law. Ficker also received an M.A. in public administration from American University in 1969. Career Ficker has been a member of the Maryland Bar since 1973. His first case went to the Supreme Court of the United States seeking to end the National Football League's blackout of sold out home football games. In 1973 Ficker, representing Deborah Drudge, gained a consent judgment signed by Federal District Court Judge Roszel C. Thomsen, forbidding evaluations based on facial features and physique, for positions in the office of the Montgomery County Attorney. The judgment said no future applicant could be asked any questions regarding marital status or child care arrangements. On January 6, 1986, U. S. District Court Judge Norman Ramsey, ordered, in a suit brought by Robin Ficker against the Montgomery County Board of Elections, that Md. Election Code Art. 33, S 23-5(4) limiting the payment of money to petition circulators for initiative measures be declared null and void under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ficker won two landmark injunctions preventing the state of Maryland from denying access to serious traffic and criminal court records. In 1992 U.S. District Court Judge Nickerson granted Ficker an injunction against provisions of the Maryland Public Information Act that denied access to police reports, criminal charging documents, and traffic citations in the Maryland Automated Traffic System. A 2003 Attorneys General opinion said the 1992 \\"Ficker order is still in effect and enforceable.\\" In 1997, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Ficker successfully challenged the constitutionality of a Maryland law forbidding lawyers from targeted direct-mail solicitation of criminal and traffic defendants within thirty days of arrest. In October 2009, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, Ficker convinced parks officials in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties to rescind enforcement of a rule requiring a permit before a person could carry signs or solicit signatures in county parks. In 2013, Ficker represented a Hyattsville, MD man who was found not guilty by a jury of all 23 counts in a case of attempted murder, armed robbery, carjacking, assault and eluding police among other charges.  2013 school discipline cases  In 2013, Ficker received widespread attention for securing school suspension reversals and disciplinary record expungement for children, ages 5- to 7-years old. A 6-year-old in Maryland had been charged with threatening \\"to shoot a student\\" for pointing his finger and saying \\"pow\\". A Pennsylvania 5-year-old was said to be making a \\"terroristic threat\\" by talking about a Hello Kitty bubble- blowing gun. A Virginia 6-year-old had been suspended for pointing his finger at another student who pretended to shoot him with a bow and arrow after their class had studied Native American culture. A 5-year-old Southern Maryland child had been suspended for 10 days for bringing a cap gun on to a school bus to show a friend. Still pending in Maryland is the matter of a suspended seven-year-old who chewed a toaster pastry into the shape of a gun.  Representation of Daron Dylon Wint  When ex-convict Daron Dylon Wint was arrested and charged in the deaths of three family members and their housekeeper, in which a ten-year-old child was tortured in order to extract money from the child's father, Ficker said Wint didn't seem violent when he defended him in earlier cases. \\"My impression of him — I remember him rather well — is that he wouldn't hurt a fly. He's a very nice person\\", Ficker said. Ficker characterized Wint as \\"kind and gentle\\", and added that authorities have arrested \\"the wrong guy\\" in the murder case, claiming, \\"They've made a big mistake here.\\" Wint was found guilty in 2018 and sentenced in 2019 to four consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Controversies and disciplinary issues In 1990, Ficker was publicly reprimanded by the Maryland Court of Appeals upon a finding that he had violated ethical rules prohibiting neglect, engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and lack of diligence. In March, 1998, he was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, with the right to reapply for admission after 120 days, arising from violations related to competence, diligence, fairness to opposing counsel and parties, supervising lawyers and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In August, 1998, he was privately reprimanded by the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission for a violation related to competence. In January, 2002, he was privately reprimanded by the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission for a violation related to client communications. Ficker was again indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in 2007. A dissenting judge in that suspension commented, \\"If disbarment is not warranted in this case for these types of issues, with a respondent with this history, it will never be warranted.\\" Ficker's law license was reinstated on December 8, 2008. In 2017 he was again reprimanded by the Maryland Court of Appeals for showing up late to Howard County District Court for a scheduled hearing in December 2015. The Court of Appeals order also stated he violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in 2013 by hiring a disbarred lawyer in a non-lawyer capacity without alerting bar counsel. Politics Ficker has run for various state and local offices since the 1970s. In 1972, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in , blanketing Montgomery County with \\"Our Friend Ficker\\" campaign signs on utility poles, trees and traffic lights, which resulted in county officials seeking an injunction to stop the placement of these signs on public property. He lost the Democratic primary to Joseph G. Anastasi. In 1978, Ficker was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates as a Republican, representing Montgomery County from 1979 to 1983. He lost a 1980 congressional primary to incumbent Republican Congressman Newton Steers. Ficker lost his bid for re-election in 1982. He ran for United States Senate in 2000, claiming to have shaken hands with more than 560,000 people before officially announcing his candidacy. Ficker unsuccessfully ran for Montgomery County Executive in 2006 receiving just under 10% of the vote. In 2009, Ficker moved from his primary residence in Boyds to his childhood home in Colesville to run for County Council in District 4 where he won a three-way Republican primary with 58% of the vote. He lost to Democrat Nancy Navarro 61% to 35%. Moving back to Boyds in 2010, Ficker ran as a Republican for Montgomery County Council District 2. Ficker lost to State Delegate Craig L. Rice (D-Dist. 15), of Germantown 59% to 40%. Ficker was a candidate in the 2012 Republican primary for the newly redistricted seat held by 10-term incumbent Roscoe Bartlett, finishing fifth in an eight-candidate field. Ficker ran unopposed for the 2014 Republican nomination for the District 15 State Senate seat in western Montgomery County. Running with his son Flynn Ficker on a candidate slate for the Maryland Senate and House, the Fickers in May reported visiting 20,000 homes. Ficker lost the District 15 State Senate election to Democrat Brian J. Feldman, who won 60.4% of the vote to Ficker's 39.5%, while his son lost his contest for the House election. In 2016, Ficker was again a candidate in a Republican primary, but this time for . He finished fourth in an eight- candidate field. Ficker won the 2018 Republican nomination for Montgomery County Executive unopposed. He was initially turned down for public matching funds. His campaign filed a lawsuit and was later notified it qualified for the public funding shortly after the primary. Ficker faced Democrat Marc Elrich and Democrat-turned-Independent Nancy Floreen in the general election on November 6, 2018. Ficker finished third with 16.5% of the votes, behind Floreen with 19.2% and the winner, Elrich, with 64.3%. In April 2020, Ficker was present at a rally in Annapolis which protested Governor Larry Hogan's stay-at-home orders. Ficker was photographed holding a sign reading \\"Robin for Governor\\", apparently confirming reports that he plans to run for governor in the 2022 Maryland gubernatorial election. Ballot initiatives Since 1974, Ficker has become known for promoting a series of ballot initiatives. The issues range from term limits, curbing tax increases, to limiting budget waste and duplication. He collected as many as 15,000 signatures for each of 20 initiatives, that together received 2 million votes. A county initiative he proposed for the November 2008 ballot received 194,151 votes, prevailing by 5,060 votes. The measure requires the nine-member Montgomery County Council to vote unanimously to raise property tax revenue above the local limit. The victory earned him the Libertarian Party's Free Market Hero of the week award. In the fall of 2015, Ficker began campaigning for a ballot measure in the 2016 general election to place term limits on the Montgomery County Executive and Montgomery County Council members. In 2016, Ficker's term limit initiative passed with 69% of the vote, limiting County Councilmembers to three consecutive terms in office. Sports heckler Ficker is known for his passionate support of the NBA's Washington Bullets (now the Washington Wizards). For many years, he heckled the opposing team at the games. Ficker had seats at USAir Arena, located in Landover, Maryland, immediately behind the visiting bench. When the team moved to downtown in Washington D.C. to the MCI Center, the Wizards took the opportunity to reseat Ficker well away from the opposing team’s bench. He gave up his seats in response. Not having been to a Wizard’s game since in April 1998, Ficker attended Game 4 of the Wizards- Pacers Eastern Conference Semifinals on May 11, 2014. Though many players from opposing teams were not fans of Ficker, Phoenix Suns star Charles Barkley in particular thought so much of him and his ability to get under player’s skin that he flew him out to Phoenix during the 1993 NBA Finals. Barkley bought Ficker a ticket directly behind the bench of the visiting Chicago Bulls with the intent that Ficker's taunts would distract the Bulls players. Ficker did not last the first quarter before being removed by America West Arena security. In 2012 Ficker appeared on The Jeff Probst Show in which he was playfully surprised by special guest Isiah Thomas, former professional basketball player, and Basketball Hall of Fame athlete. Probst shares that Thomas, in agreeing to appear on the show said, \\"Ficker was one of the greats\\".\\"Would You Say That To My Face?\\" The Jeff Probst Show. Season 1. Episode 59. November 30, 2012. In 2013 Ficker was featured on ESPN's Olbermann in which his heckling was discussed along with the often acrimonious fan vs. player interactions that would result. The University of Maryland wrestling team won Ficker's support in 2010 with his letter to The Washington Post criticizing the lack of coverage for the Terrapin team and his attendance at the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina as well as the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championship in Omaha, Nebraska. His vocal and visible support remains ongoing as of 2015. Personal life Family Ficker has a daughter and two sons. Ficker's daughter, Desiree Ficker, is a top female professional triathlete, finishing second at the 2006 Ironman Triathlon World Championships in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Ficker's 20-year marriage to the late Dr. Frances Annette Ficker ended in divorce. 1995 traffic incident In 1996, Ficker was acquitted of destruction of property in a 1995 traffic incident and saw battery charges dropped by the State's Attorney after a jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of acquittal. Ficker had been convicted in a non-jury District Court trial but appealed for a Circuit Court jury trial. In the traffic incident the driver of the car Ficker allegedly hit reported that he struck her in the face, breaking her glasses.

Unlike most Malaysian states, the history of modern Penang was shaped by British colonialism, beginning with the acquisition of Penang Island from the Sultanate of Kedah by the British East India Company in 1786. Developed into a free port, the city state was subsequently governed as part of the Straits Settlements, together with Singapore and Malacca; the state capital, George Town, briefly became the capital of this political entity between 1826 and 1832. By the end of the 19th century, George Town prospered and became one of the major entrepôts in Southeast Asia. During World War II, Penang was conquered and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1941 to 1945. At the end of the war, Penang was also the first state in the Malay Peninsula to be liberated by the British, under Operation Jurist. The Straits Settlements was dissolved in the following year and Penang was merged into the Federation of Malaya. In spite of a secessionist movement within Penang, the merger with Malaya went ahead and the federation attained independence from the British Empire in 1957. Malaya later evolved into the present-day Malaysia in 1963. Following the revocation of George Town's free port status in the 1960s, the state suffered economic decline and massive unemployment. The state government at the time led a push to reorient the economy towards hi-tech manufacturing, successfully recovering Penang's economy and lending the state its moniker the Silicon Valley of the East. Growing recognition of George Town as a bustling tourist destination, particularly since the city's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, also boosted the state's services sector, and today, both the manufacturing and services sectors are the two strongest economic pillars of Penang. Moreover, the state enjoys one of the lowest unemployment rates and Gini coefficients within Malaysia, as well as the second highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita within the country after Kuala Lumpur.  Ancient Penang  Evidence of prehistoric human settlement in what is now Penang has been discovered in Guar Kepah within Seberang Perai (formerly Province Wellesley), the mainland half of Penang. Human remains, dating back to about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, have been found at the site south of the Muda River, along with seashells, pottery and hunting tools. These indicate that Seberang Perai had been inhabited by nomadic Melanesians from as early as the Neolithic era. Seberang Perai also became part of the Bujang Valley civilisation. The Cherok Tok Kun megalith in Bukit Mertajam, discovered in 1845, contains Pali inscriptions, indicating that an early Hindu-Buddhist political entity in what is now Kedah had established control over parts of Seberang Perai sometime between the 5th and 6th centuries. The entirety of what is now Penang would later form part of the Sultanate of Kedah up until the late 18th century. Meanwhile, Penang Island was first documented by Chinese sailors of the Ming dynasty in the 15th century. At the time, Ming Emperor Yongle was in the midst of launching naval expeditions that would eventually reach all the way to eastern Africa. The island, known as Bīnláng Yù (), was mapped by Admiral Zheng He's fleet in the 'Nautical Charts of Zheng He'. One of the first Englishmen to arrive on Penang Island was the privateer James Lancaster who commanded the Edward Bonadventure. He landed at Batu Ferringhi in June 1592 and remained on the island until September, pillaging every vessel he encountered. Penang Island was also indicated as Pulo Pinaom in Portuguese historian Emanuel Godinho de Eredia's 1613 map of the Malay Peninsula. In the early 18th century, ethnic Minangkabaus from Sumatra, led by Haji Muhammad Salleh (also known as Nakhoda Intan), landed on Penang Island, establishing a seaside settlement at Batu Uban in 1734. They were followed by the Arabs, who subsequently intermarried with the Minangkabau; this gave rise to the Arab-Minangkabau admixture now described as Malay, as they have assimilated into the local Malay community.  Founding of Penang  The history of modern Penang only began in earnest in the late 18th century. Up until then, the Sultanate of Kedah, which had control over Penang, had maintained turbulent diplomatic relations with Siam to the north. In the 1770s, the British East India Company instructed Francis Light to establish trade relations in the Malay Peninsula. Light subsequently landed in Kedah, which at that point was threatened by both Siam and Burma, as well as an internal Bugis rebellion. Fort Cornwallis, in the heart of George Town, was constructed at the spot where Francis Light first set foot on Penang Island. King George III, who ruled the British Empire between 1760 and 1801. Aware of this situation, Light formed friendly relations with the then Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II, and promised British military protection. As part of his promises, Light assisted in the quelling of the Bugis revolt by recapturing a Bugis-held fort for the Sultan. The Sultan reciprocated by offering Penang Island to Light. Light subsequently wrote to his superiors regarding the offer, arguing that Penang Island could serve as a \\"convenient magazine for trade\\" and its strategic location would allow the British to check Dutch and French territorial gains in Southeast Asia. He also made the case that, with the other ports in the region, such as Aceh and Phuket, riddled with piracy and despotic governments, the British East India Company could seize the opportunity to establish a tranquil harbour on Penang Island conducive for free trade, noting that if \\"Malay, Bugis and Chinese will come to reside here, it will become the Exchange of the East if not loaded with impositions and restrictions\\". However, nothing transpired until 1786, when by that point the British were fighting the Thirteen American Colonies, which were backed by France and the Netherlands. Faced with the Dutch dominance of the East Indies (now Indonesia) and a growing French threat, Light, who by then had risen to the rank of Captain, was ordered to acquire Penang Island from Kedah. The British East India Company sought control of Penang Island as a Royal Navy base, and a trading post between China and the Indian subcontinent. Light negotiated with the new Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah, regarding the cession of Penang Island to the British East India Company in exchange for British military assistance and a lease of 6,000 Spanish dollars to cancel Kedah's debts to Siam. With the agreement between Light and the Kedah Sultan successfully concluded, Light and his entourage sailed on to Penang Island, where they arrived on 17 July 1786. Fort Cornwallis would later be built at the spot where Light first set foot. The area where Light first landed was originally a mangrove swamp covered in thick jungle. Once enough land was cleared, creating what is now the Esplanade, a ceremony was held on 11 August, during which the Union Jack was raised for the first time. This signified the formal possession of Penang Island by the British East India Company in the name of King George III. The island was renamed the Prince of Wales Island after the heir to the British throne, while the new settlement of George Town was established in honour of King George III. Thus, George Town became the first British settlement in Southeast Asia and a springboard for future British territorial expansion in the region, while its establishment by the British East India Company marked the start of a period of British imperialism in the Malay Peninsula. Unbeknownst to the Kedah Sultan, however, Light had acted without the authority or consent of his superiors in India. When Light reneged on his promise of British military protection against Siam, the Kedah Sultan in 1791 assembled an army in what is now Seberang Perai to retake the Prince of Wales Island. The Sultan's force was also assisted by a fleet of pirates. Fortunately for Light, his garrison on the island was reinforced by two companies from Calcutta. After failing to persuade the Sultan to disband his forces, the British East India Company launched amphibious assaults at night, destroying Kedah's military installations in Perai, and defeating both the pirates and the Sultan's army. In 1800, the first Lieutenant-Governor of the Prince of Wales Island, Sir George Leith, gained a strip of Seberang Perai from the Kedah Sultan and renamed it Province Wellesley. The newly acquired land covered an area south of the Perai River, turning the river into the international border between the British-controlled Province Wellesley and Kedah. At the time, Province Wellesley was heavily forested and sparsely populated, with a total population of only 5,000. In exchange to this acquisition, the annual payment to the Kedah Sultan was increased to 10,000 Spanish dollars per annum. To this day, the Malaysian federal government still pays Kedah, on behalf of Penang, RM10,000 annually as a symbolic gesture. Francis Light's grave in the Old Protestant Cemetery in George Town. Following the original acquisition in 1800, Province Wellesley was gradually expanded up to its present-day boundaries in 1874, when the Pangkor Treaty, which included the delineation of Province Wellesley's southern borders, was signed between the British and the neighbouring Sultanate of Perak. Province Wellesley thus gained the town of Sungai Acheh from Perak. Light died from malaria in 1794 and was buried within the Old Protestant Cemetery in George Town. To this day, Light is honoured as the founding father of Penang.  Early growth  An 1818 painting depicting George Town and Province Wellesley (in the horizon), as seen from a hilltop. High Court of Penang in George Town was established in 1808, making it the birthplace of Malaysia's modern-day judiciary. Francis Light had established George Town as a free port, thus allowing merchants to trade without having to pay any form of tax or duties. In effect, this measure was intended to entice merchants from the Dutch ports in the region. As a result, the number of incoming vessels increased exponentially from 85 in 1786 to 3,569 in 1802; George Town's population had also risen to 10,000 by 1792. Immigrants came from various parts of Asia; in 1801, the then Lieutenant-Governor of the Prince of Wales Island, Sir George Leith, remarked that \\"there is not, probably, any part of the world where, in so small a space, so many different people are assembled together or so great a variety of languages spoken\\". A committee of assessors was also established for George Town in 1800, making it the first local government to be established within British Malaya. The Prince of Wales Island, together with Province Wellesley, had been administered under the Bengal Presidency until 1805, when Penang was made a separate Presidency on par with Madras, Bombay and Bengal. By then, Penang also served as a penal station; in 1796, 700 Indian convicts were shipped in from the Andaman Islands. The practice of employing Indian convicts continued throughout the 19th century as a means to provide the necessary labour for public infrastructure works, such as the construction of roads, drains and public buildings. In 1807, a Royal Charter to provide for the establishment of a Supreme Court and a police force in Penang was granted. The Supreme Court of Penang was first opened at Fort Cornwallis in George Town in 1808, with Edmond Stanley assuming office as its first Recorder (Judge). In the decades that followed, Penang's judiciary and the police force were progressively applied to the Straits Settlements, and later copied throughout British Malaya. Hence, Penang was the birthplace of the present-day Malaysian judiciary system, as well as the Royal Malaysian Police. In the early 19th century, Penang became a centre of spice production and trade within Southeast Asia. The cultivation of pepper began soon after the founding of George Town in 1786. The production of spices, including nutmeg and clove, gradually grew more varied and the booming spice trade led to the opening of spice farms all over Penang. The export of spices through the Port of Penang also enabled the British East India Company to cover the administrative costs of Penang. Furthermore, the agricultural plantations would fuel the growth of several villages, such as Air Itam and Balik Pulau on the island, and Bukit Mertajam in Province Wellesley. Malay refugees fleeing the Siamese invasion of Kedah and Chinese immigrants formed the bulk of workers in these agricultural estates. Other areas, such as Bayan Lepas on the island and Kepala Batas in Province Wellesley, were founded as rice-producing estates.  Straits Settlements  Edinburgh House, at the site of present Dewan Sri Pinang, was occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh on his 1869 visit Salma Nasution Khoo, Streets of George Town, Penang The Port of Penang at Weld Quay in George Town in 1910. Weld Quay was reclaimed from the sea in the 1880s. In 1826, the British East India Company amalgamated the territories of Penang, Singapore (acquired from Johor in 1819) and Malacca (acquired from the Netherlands in 1824) into a single political entity, the Straits Settlements. George Town was made the administrative and judicial capital of the new entity. However, owing to Singapore's more strategic geographical location between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, the Port of Singapore rapidly surpassed the Port of Penang as the preeminent harbour in the region. Consequently, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements in 1832. Nonetheless, George Town continued to retain its importance as a vital British entrepôt by funneling the exports meant for global shipping lines which had bypassed other regional harbours. In the latter half of the 19th century, the tin mining boom within the neighbouring Sultanate of Perak and Siam brought more prosperity to Penang. Tin produced from within the Kinta Valley and southern Siam were transported to George Town for smelting, before being exported via the Port of Penang to European and American industries. The Port of Penang subsequently became a major tin-exporting harbour within British Malaya, directly challenging the Port of Singapore. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the advent of steamships further cemented the Port of Penang's importance as a major entrepôt within British Malaya. By the end of the 19th century, George Town also evolved into a leading financial centre of British Malaya, as mercantile firms and international banks, including Standard Chartered and HSBC, flocked into the city. By then, Penang became home to a myriad of ethnicities and religious affinities. Aside from the sizeable Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Eurasian and Siamese communities, the colony's multi-ethnic and multi-religious society included significant minorities of Burmese, British, Javanese, Japanese, Sinhalese, Jewish, German and Armenian origin. At the time, each ethnic community had a tendency to specialise in specific trades and economic sectors. While the Europeans predominated in the various professional fields, as well as occupying managerial positions in mercantile and shipping firms, the Peranakans and the Eurasians tended to enter the nascent civil service as lawyers, engineers, architects and clerks. Some of the newer Chinese arrivals, labelled condescendingly by the Peranakans as Sinkheh (Chinese: 新客; meaning new guests), were coolies and agricultural farmers, although many eventually entered into commercial, trading and real estate enterprises within the city; certain dialect communities, such as the Cantonese and the Hakka, predominated as artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters and cooks. The Indians, who were first brought in as convict workers for public works, also began competing with the Chinese in commercial, trading and shipping stevedore activities. Ethnic Malays, meanwhile, were primarily engaged in agricultural occupations, including rice farming and fishing. Other ethnic communities, such as the Jews and the Armenians, were mainly engaged in mercantile and commercial ventures; the latter community was notable for the establishment of the Eastern & Oriental Hotel, for instance. The rapid population growth that resulted from the booming economy led to several social problems, chiefly the inadequate sanitation and public health facilities, as well as rampant crime. The latter was brought about by an influx of Chinese immigrants, which led to the formation of feuding triads and secret societies. Turf wars between the triads worsened, and when the Straits Settlements authorities attempted to put a stop to the triad activities in 1857, the Chinese triads came into conflict against the British-led police force as well. This culminated in the Penang Riots of 1867 in the streets of George Town, when the Kean Teik Tong, led by Khoo Thean Teik and the Red Flag, clashed against the alliance of the Ghee Hin Kongsi and the White Flag. The resulting civil unrest lasted for 10 days, before the turf war was eventually quelled by the Straits Settlements authorities under newly appointed Lieutenant-Governor Edward Anson, who were assisted by European residents and reinforcements from Singapore. Also in the same year, the Straits Settlements was made a British crown colony, thereby placing the administration of Penang, Singapore and Malacca directly under the Colonial Office in London. Direct British rule meant better enforcement of the rule of law, as Penang's police force was vastly beefed up and the secret societies that had plagued George Town during the preceding decades were gradually outlawed. Meanwhile, in Province Wellesley, new railway lines were being constructed, with the first railroad being the Bukit Mertajam-Perai line in 1899. The town of Butterworth was also established in the mid-19th century as the transportation hub within Province Wellesley. In 1894, the first cross-strait ferry service between George Town and Butterworth commenced operations, and would eventually evolve into the present-day Rapid Ferry. With improved access to education and rising living standards, Penang soon enjoyed substantial press freedom and there was a greater degree of participation in municipal affairs by its Asian residents. Penang's representatives in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council gained a reputation for their assertive contestation of the policies made by the Singapore-based British authorities, which sometimes went against Penang's interests. On top of that, George Town, perceived as being more intellectually receptive than Singapore, also served as a magnet for well known English authors, Asian intellectuals and reformists. For instance, the Chinese revolutionary leader, Sun Yat-sen, chose to relocate his Southeast Asian base from Singapore to George Town, where he continued his efforts to reorganise and raise funds for the Chinese revolutionary movement against the Qing dynasty. These efforts culminated in the famous 1910 Penang conference, which paved the way to the ultimately triumphant Wuchang uprising that overthrew the Manchu imperial government of China.  World wars   World War I  A 1914 map from The New York Times depicting the Battle of Penang. On 28 October 1914, the Battle of Penang occurred, during which an Imperial German Navy cruiser, , covertly sailed into George Town and sank the Imperial Russian Navy cruiser, Zhemchug. The French Navy destroyer, Mousquet, set off in pursuit, before being sunk by SMS Emden as well off the northwestern tip of Penang Island. 147 French and Russian sailors perished, while the survivors were rescued by local Malay fishermen. Aside from the naval battle, Penang, as well as the Straits Settlements, was largely unaffected by the events of World War I. World War II An Imperial Japanese Navy submarine at the Port of Penang in George Town in 1942. World War II, on the other hand, unleashed unprecedented social and political upheaval to Penang. The swift British retreat, coupled with the brutal massacres of Penang's Chinese residents, would severely dent British sense of prestige and dominance in the eyes of the locals. From 9 until 18 December 1941, Japanese warplanes indiscriminately strafed and bombed George Town, in the process eliminating the obsolete Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force squadrons based in RAF Butterworth and the Bayan Lepas Aerodrome (now Penang International Airport). It was estimated that 600 civilians were killed as a result of the Japanese bombardment, with an additional 1,100 wounded. Notwithstanding the fact that the British Army had earlier designated Penang Island as a fortress, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival then ordered a withdrawal from Penang. Not only did the British Army abandon the Batu Maung Fort on the island, they also surreptitiously evacuated Penang's European population, leaving the colony's Asian populace to the mercy of the impending Japanese occupation. To this day, it has been agreed that the withdrawal and the covert evacuation of Europeans led to the loss of the British sense of invincibility, and that \\"the moral collapse of British rule in Southeast Asia came not in Singapore, but in Penang\\". Penang fell to the Imperial Japanese Army on 19 December 1941, marking the start of a period of Japanese occupation. Penang Island was renamed Tojo-to, after the Japanese Prime Minister at the time, Hideki Tojo. George Town's harbour facilities were also put to use as a major Axis submarine base in Southeast Asia. The Japanese enacted dissimilar policies with each ethnic community. Ethnic Chinese residents arguably suffered the most brutal treatment, as the Imperial Japanese Army massacred thousands of Chinese as part of the Sook Ching campaign to rid what was perceived as anti- Japanese elements in the society. Penang's womenfolk were also coerced to work as comfort women by the Imperial Japanese Army. Royal Marines liberating George Town on 3 September 1945. Japanese prisoners of war being marched through the streets of George Town by their British captors on 3 September 1945. Penang's residents also had to endure economic hardship during the Japanese occupation, with hyperinflation caused by the oversupply of the Japanese-issued 'banana' dollars, and the acute shortage of food and raw materials, due to a combination of Japanese wartime rationing and an Allied blockade of Japanese shipping.Currency replacement and price freeze, Syonan Shimbun, 23 February 1942, Page 3Financing Japan’s World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia, Gregg Huff and Shinobu Majima, Pembroke College – University of Oxford and Faculty of Economics – Gakushuin University, pp. 7–19Japan needs ships, The Decatur Daily Review, Decatur, Illinois, Saturday, July 31, 1943 – p. 4 Households were forced to turn to secondary crops such as sweet potatoes, yam and tapioca for their own subsistence. Beginning in 1942, a standardised Japanese curricula was enforced in all schools throughout Penang, with Japanese as the official language. In fact, social lifestyles were also greatly impacted, as it became compulsory to bow to Japanese soldiers on guard duty and to sing the Japanese national anthem, whilst whole streets and shops were renamed in Japanese.Privilege To Bow To Sentry On Duty, Syonan Shimbun, 9 March 1942, Page 3. Retrieved 31 March 2017 Between 1944 and 1945, Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Force bomber squadrons based in India repeatedly launched bombing raids on George Town, seeking to destroy naval and administrative facilities. The destruction of the Penang Secretariat building by the Allied bombardment caused the loss of a large part of the British and Japanese records concerning Penang Island, complicating post-war efforts to compile a comprehensive history of Penang. The Penang Strait was also mined as part of efforts to constrict Japanese shipping. Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, the Penang Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, published the proclamation of surrender issued by the Emperor of Japan. Under Operation Jurist, a British Royal Navy fleet accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrison in Penang on 2 September 1945. A British Royal Marines contingent recaptured Penang Island on the following day, making George Town the first city in Malaya to be liberated at the end of the war. Post-war Penang was placed under a military administration until 1946, as the British sought to restore order in the face of an emerging Communist insurgency. The British also dissolved the Straits Settlements in April 1946, with Sir Shenton Thomas being its last Governor; Penang and Malacca were then merged with the Federated Malay States and the Unfederated Malay States to form the Malayan Union (the new Colony of Singapore, excluded from this union, was to remain firmly under British rule). The Malayan Union was replaced by the Federation of Malaya in 1948. As the gradual withdrawal of the Western colonial powers in Southeast Asia continued taking shape, the independence of Malaya as a united political entity seemed a foregone conclusion. However, the merger of the British crown colony of Penang into the vast Malay heartland alarmed some quarters of Penang's population. Questions were raised over economic and ethnic issues, such as the citizenship of non-Malays, greater trade regulations imposed on Penang by the central government in Kuala Lumpur and the introduction of export duties for trade with the rest of Malaya. Consequently, the Penang Secession Committee, formed in 1948, proposed to exclude Penang from the Federation of Malaya, which would allow Penang to either retain its links with the British Empire or form a political union with Singapore. The movement was led by D.A. Mackay, then the chairman of the Penang Chamber of Commerce, and included the Penang Muslim Chamber of Commerce, the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Penang Straits Chinese Association, the Penang Eurasian Association and the Penang Indian Chamber of Commerce. Ultimately, the Penang Secession Committee failed to attain its goals and petered out. A secession motion tabled in the Penang Settlement Council in 1949 was narrowly dismissed by British official votes, while another petition sent to London in 1951 also met with British disapproval. While some British and American observers were sympathetic to the secessionists' cause, the British administrators were reluctant to jeopardise their own plans to gradually grant independence to a united Malayan polity. Moreover, the British government allayed the fears raised by the secessionists by guaranteeing George Town's free port status and by reintroducing municipal elections for the city in 1951. On 1 January 1957, George Town, the capital of Penang, was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, becoming the first city within the Federation of Malaya, and by extension, Malaysia. George Town continued to be the only city within Malaysia (other than Singapore between 1963 and its Separation in 1965) until 1972, when Kuala Lumpur was also conferred city status. Penang, as part of the Federation of Malaya, gained independence from the British Empire on 31 August 1957, and subsequently became a member state of Malaysia in 1963. Post-independence  1957–1969  Penang's political landscape immediately after the independence of Malaya became relatively fractured. The new Penang state government was dominated by the Alliance coalition (now succeeded by Barisan Nasional), the same ruling coalition that controlled the Malayan federal government. Wong Pow Nee of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), one of the major component parties of the Alliance, became Penang's first Chief Minister, a position that he held until 1969. On the other hand, the Labour Party, a left-wing opposition party, took control of the George Town City Council soon after the Malayan independence. Penang's voters tended to leave the control of the state government in the hands of the Alliance, while consistently electing the Labour Party to run the city council. At the time, the George Town City Council was the only fully elected local authority in Malaya, as well as the country's richest, with an annual revenue that was double that of the Penang state government by 1965. This solidified the financial autonomy of the city council, with its revenue going into social welfare projects within George Town. Meanwhile, the Penang state government attempted to boost the state's manufacturing sector by opening new industrial estates in Seberang Perai, such as in Perai and Mak Mandin. Exacerbated by the opposing political affinities and ideologies, conflicts frequently arose between the state government and the city council over differences in policies and budget allocations. As previously guaranteed by the British authorities, George Town's free port status was untouched in the years immediately after the Malayan independence. The earlier fears by the secessionists eventually came true, however, when in 1969, the free port status was suddenly revoked by the Malaysian federal government. Consequently, 16.4% of Penang's working population became unemployed as the Port of Penang's trade volume plummeted, adversely affecting George Town's services sector. In the long run, this also marked the beginning of George Town's slow, decades-long decline, which was only recently reversed. The revocation of George Town's free port status, coupled with an unsuccessful, bloody strike by Penang's unions in 1967, led to a loss of popular support for the Alliance amongst Penangites. During the 1969 State Elections, Gerakan, then an opposition party, was voted into power in Penang, replacing the Alliance. The party's founder, Lim Chong Eu, succeeded Wong Pow Nee as the Chief Minister of Penang. However, the violent race riots in Kuala Lumpur following the concurrent Malaysian General Elections led to the nationwide imposition of martial law and the functions of the Penang state government were taken over by the National Operations Council until 1971.  1970–1990  Komtar Tower in George Town is Penang's tallest skyscraper. The township of Bayan Baru was first developed by the Penang Development Corporation in the 1970s following the establishment of the adjacent Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone. In 1973, Gerakan joined Barisan Nasional, thus returning the Penang state government back into the hands of the ruling coalition. To revive Penang's economy, Lim Chong Eu created the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone and courted foreign multinational corporations for investments. Pioneer tax status was granted to multinational firms seeking to establish assembly plants within Bayan Lepas, which was formerly the rice bowl of Penang. Major electronic and engineering firms, including Motorola, Bosch, Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi, flocked in, setting up assembly plants within the area. Complemented by cheap labour, the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, one of the major electronics manufacturing zones in Asia, grew to become the Silicon Valley of the East and was instrumental in pulling Penang out from its economic slump, greatly propelling the state's economy as one of the main economic powerhouses within Malaysia. To this day, manufacturing remains one of Penang's two largest economic sectors, contributing as much as 47.4% of Penang's GDP . During Lim's tenure, several major infrastructure projects were completed. The Penang Bridge, then the longest bridge in Southeast Asia, was completed in 1985, thus providing for the first time a road link between Penang Island and the Malay Peninsula. More controversial was the -tall Komtar in George Town, to this day the tallest skyscraper in Penang. Launched in 1974 as part of his vision to reverse George Town's declining fortunes, Komtar was constructed in the expense of hundreds of shophouses, schools and temples, as well as whole streets, which were bulldozed for the project. However, instead of arresting George Town's decline, Komtar itself became a white elephant by the early 2000s. Meanwhile, in 1974, the Port of Penang was relocated from George Town to the town of Butterworth, directly across the Penang Strait, to allow for the berthing of larger container and cargo vessels. By then, the maritime traffic through Penang had been greatly diminished since the revocation of George Town's free port status, with increasing volumes of maritime trade being directed towards Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur instead. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the Malaysian federal government proceeded with the rapid development of Kuala Lumpur and nearby Port Klang, by controlling investments in communication, transport, education and health. Kuala Lumpur soon outstripped George Town as Malaysia's largest city and financial centre, while Port Klang quickly became the country's busiest seaport. Consequently, Penang began to suffer considerable brain drain as younger Penangites started emigrating for better employment opportunities. In 1974, the George Town City Council was merged with the Penang Island Rural District Council to form the Penang Island Municipal Council, while the five local authorities within Seberang Perai, including the Butterworth and Bukit Mertajam town councils, were merged into the Seberang Perai Municipal Council. By then, local elections, suspended since 1965, became a thing of the past, with the municipal councillors being appointed by the Penang state government ever since. The merger of the local governments on Penang Island also led to a decades-long dispute over George Town's city status. In the 1990 State Elections, Lim Chong Eu as the incumbent lost the Padang Kota constituency to Lim Kit Siang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), forcing him into retirement. Although Barisan Nasional remained in power, Lim Chong Eu was succeeded by Koh Tsu Koon as the Chief Minister of Penang.  1991–2008  Koh Tsu Koon's tenure as the Chief Minister of Penang was marked by inept development and urban planning policies, rampant pollution, and the deteriorating general state of affairs within Penang. Political tussles complicated development policies, while simmering discontent from Penang's vocal non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and residents over the state's decline would eventually lead to an unprecedented political change within the state. In the early 1990s, plans for the development of Penang Hill were drawn up by the Penang state government, drawing considerable backlash from Penang's civil societies over the potential environmental degradation of the forested hill. The plan was eventually axed. Meanwhile, the Rent Control Act, which until then had protected the low-income residents within the George Town city centre from eviction by preventing any arbitrary hike in rents, was repealed by 2001. This consequently led to the further hollowing out of the city centre, as residents, and smaller businesses, were unable to cope with the rental hikes and moved out. Unscrupulous private developers began demolishing several pre-war heritage buildings within the city centre for redevelopment, while other historic buildings fell under disrepair. Concerned over the impending loss of George Town's heritage architecture, NGOs based within the city started to mobilise public support for the conservation of these historic buildings. By the early 2000s, Penang's economic growth began to lose steam, with the city-state recording the lowest monthly household income growth rate amongst the Malaysian states. The decades of brain drain also took its toll. For instance, while Kuala Lumpur was granted several mega-projects, including the Petronas Towers and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Penang suffered a shortage of qualified engineers and architects as professionals continued gravitating towards the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Moreover, the lack of a coherent urban planning policy and poor traffic management meant that little was done to curb the worsening traffic congestion within Penang. Even the state's reputation for cleanliness was not spared, as reports of coastal pollution and dirty streets within Penang made headline news. As early as 1996, the then Malaysian Prime Mninister, Mahathir Mohamad, had even labelled Penang a \\"garbage state\\". Widespread dissatisfaction over Penang's decline and neglect sparked a media campaign to restore Penang to its former glory in 2004. It has since been speculated that the public outcry over the neglect of the city once known as the Pearl of the Orient, combined with Penang's relatively lively political scene, contributed to the defeat of Barisan Nasional in the 2008 State Election by the federal opposition pact, Pakatan Rakyat. The opposition coalition, led by the DAP, subsequently took over the Penang state government, with Lim Guan Eng succeeding Koh as the Chief Minister of Penang. In late 2004, Penang was hit by the massive Indian Ocean tsunami. Out of the 68 deaths within Malaysia, 52 were in Penang. Northern coastal areas, such as Batu Ferringhi and Gurney Drive in George Town, were among the worst hit places within the state. In the aftermath of the tsunami, a network of sirens has been installed throughout Penang as part of a national tsunami warning system designed to alert the public of such calamities in the future.  2008  The historic city centre of George Town has been gazetted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008. The swearing in of the new Penang state government, now led by Pakatan Rakyat, in 2008, heralded various positive policy changes. During that year, the George Town city centre, along with Malacca, was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a result of years of conservation efforts led by the city's NGOs. The new state government subsequently spearheaded efforts to improve hygiene, cleanliness and pedestrianisation, as well as the use of public transportation and the promotion of the city's cultural diversity. By 2010, George Town was ranked the most liveable city in Malaysia by ECA International, coming in at eighth place within Asia as well. Moreover, in 2017, the city was also ranked the second cleanest within Malaysia, behind only Ipoh. In the economic front, the present state government has emphasised efforts to attract foreign direct investments and to push Penang up the economic value chain, as well as policies to root out corruption. In 2010, Penang recorded the highest amount of capital investments within Malaysia, attracting RM12.2 billion, or 26%, of the nation's total investments. Penang's stunning economic recovery, particularly since 2008, was described by Bloomberg as Malaysia's \\"biggest economic success\\" despite the Malaysian federal government's focus on other states such as Johor and Sarawak. On top of that, the Penang state government was able to decrease Penang's public debt by 95%, from RM630 million in 2008 to RM30 million by late 2011. In addition, in 2016, George Town was rated as the most attractive destination for commercial property investment within Malaysia by Knight Frank, surpassing even Kuala Lumpur. In 2015, the Malaysian federal government elevated the Penang Island Municipal Council into the present-day Penang Island City Council, thereby expanding the jurisdiction of George Town to encompass the entire Penang Island, as well as five of the surrounding islets. This also made George Town the only Malaysian city to have been conferred its city status twice. The Second Penang Bridge, currently the longest bridge in Southeast Asia, was opened in 2013. Straddling a length of , it provides a second road link between Penang Island and Seberang Perai, and has spurred the development of new industrial areas such as Batu Kawan.

The EF-hand motif contains a helix-loop- helix topology, much like the spread thumb and forefinger of the human hand, in which the Ca2+ ions are coordinated by ligands within the loop. The motif takes its name from traditional nomenclature used in describing the protein parvalbumin, which contains three such motifs and is probably involved in muscle relaxation via its calcium-binding activity. The EF-hand consists of two alpha helices linked by a short loop region (usually about 12 amino acids) that usually binds calcium ions. EF-hands also appear in each structural domain of the signaling protein calmodulin and in the muscle protein troponin-C.  Calcium ion binding site  EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif. * The calcium ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The six residues involved in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12; these residues are denoted by X, Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12 provides two oxygens for liganding Ca (bidentate ligand). * The calcium ion is bound by both protein backbone atoms and by amino acid side chains, specifically those of the acidic amino acid residues aspartate and glutamate. These residues are negatively charged and will make a charge- interaction with the positively charged calcium ion. The EF hand motif was among the first structural motifs whose sequence requirements were analyzed in detail. Five of the loop residues bind calcium and thus have a strong preference for oxygen-containing side chains, especially aspartate and glutamate. The sixth residue in the loop is necessarily glycine due to the conformational requirements of the backbone. The remaining residues are typically hydrophobic and form a hydrophobic core that binds and stabilizes the two helices. * Upon binding to Ca2+, this motif may undergo conformational changes that enable Ca2+-regulated functions as seen in Ca2+ effectors such as calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C (TnC) and Ca2+ buffers such as calreticulin and calbindin D9k. While the majority of the known EF-hand Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) contain paired EF-hand motifs, CaBP’s with single EF hands have also been discovered in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In addition, \\"EF- hand-like motifs\\" have been found in a number of bacteria. Although the coordination properties remain similar with the canonical 29-residue helix- loop-helix EF-hand motif, the EF-hand-like motifs differ from EF-hands in that they contain deviations in the secondary structure of the flanking sequences and/or variation in the length of the Ca2+-coordinating loop. * EF hands have very high selectivity for calcium. For example, the dissociation constant of alpha parvalbumin for Ca2+ is ~1000 times lower than that for the similar ion Mg2+. This high selectivity is due to the relatively rigid coordination geometry, the presence of multiple charged amino acid side chains in the binding site, as well as the ion solvation properties.  Prediction  Summary of motif signatures used for prediction of EF-hands. * Pattern (motif signature) search is one of the most straightforward ways to predict continuous EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites in proteins. Based on the sequence alignment results of canonical EF-hand motifs, especially the conserved side chains directly involved in Ca2+ binding, a pattern has been generated to predict canonical EF-hand sites. A prediction servers may be found in the external links section.  Classification  * Since the delineation of the EF-hand motif in 1973, the family of EF-hand proteins has expanded to include at least 66 subfamilies thus far. EF-hand motifs are divided into two major groups: ** Canonical EF-hands as seen in calmodulin (CaM) and the prokaryotic CaM-like protein calerythrin. The 12-residue canonical EF-hand loop binds Ca2+ mainly via sidechain carboxylates or carbonyls (loop sequence positions 1, 3, 5, 12). The residue at the –X axis coordinates the Ca2+ ion through a bridged water molecule. The EF-hand loop has a bidentate ligand (Glu or Asp) at axis –Z. ** Pseudo EF-hands exclusively found in the N-termini of S100 and S100-like proteins. The 14-residue pseudo EF-hand loop chelates Ca2+ primarily via backbone carbonyls (positions 1, 4, 6, 9). Additional points: Phylogenetic tree of the EF-hand protein family. * EF-hand-like proteins with diversified flanking structural elements around the Ca2+-binding loop have been reported in bacteria and viruses. These prokaryotic EF-hand-like proteins are widely implicated in Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis in bacteria. They contain flexible lengths of Ca2+-binding loops that differ from the EF-hand motifs. However, their coordination properties resemble classical EF-hand motifs. ** For example, the semi-continuous Ca2+-binding site in D-galactose-binding protein (GBP) contains a nine-residue loop. The Ca2+ ion is coordinated by seven protein oxygen atoms, five of which are from the loop mimicking the canonical EF-loop whereas the other two are from the carboxylate group of a distant Glu. ** Another example is a novel domain named Excalibur (extracellular Ca2+-binding region) isolated from Bacillus subtilis. This domain has a conserved 10-residue Ca2+-binding loop strikingly similar to the canonical 12-residue EF-hand loop. ** The diversity of the structure of the flanking region is illustrated by the discovery of EF-hand-like domains in bacterial proteins. For example, a helix-loop-strand instead of the helix- loop-helix structure is in periplasmic galactose-binding protein (Salmonella typhimurium, ) or alginate-binding protein (Sphingomonas sp., ); the entering helix is missing in protective antigen (Bacillus anthracis, ) or dockerin (Clostridium thermocellum, ). *Among all the structures reported to date, the majority of EF-hand motifs are paired either between two canonical or one pseudo and one canonical motifs. For proteins with odd numbers of EF-hands, such as the penta-EF-hand calpain, EF-hand motifs were coupled through homo- or hetero-dimerization. The recently-identified EF-hand containing ER Ca2+ sensor protein, stromal interaction molecule 1 and 2 (STIM1, STIM2), has been shown to contain a Ca2+-binding canonical EF-hand motif that pairs with an immediate, downstream atypical \\"hidden\\" non-Ca2+-binding EF-hand. Single EF- hand motifs can serve as protein-docking modules: for example, the single EF hand in the NKD1 and NKD2 proteins binds the Dishevelled (DVL1, DVL2, DVL3) proteins. * Functionally, the EF-hands can be divided into two classes: 1) signaling proteins and 2) buffering/transport proteins. The first group is the largest and includes the most well-known members of the family such as calmodulin, troponin C and S100B. These proteins typically undergo a calcium- dependent conformational change which opens a target binding site. The latter group is represented by calbindin D9k and do not undergo calcium dependent conformational changes.  Subfamilies  * EPS15 homology (EH) domain –  Examples   Aequorin  Aequorin is a calcium binding protein (CaBP) isolated from the coelenterate Aequorea victoria. Aequorin belongs to the EF- hand family of CaBPs, with EF-hand loops that are closely related to CaBPs in mammals. In addition, aequorin has been used for years as an indicator of Ca2+ and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated by cells. Aequorin is made up of two components – the calcium binding component apoaequorin (AQ) and the chemiluminescent molecule coelenterazine. The AQ portion of this protein contains the EF-hand calcium binding domains.

Blunt The 2nd Vermont Brigade was an infantry brigade in the Union Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War.  Composition and commanders  The brigade was composed of the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th Vermont Infantry regiments, all nine-month regiments raised as a result of President Lincoln's call on August 4, 1862, for additional troops due to the disastrous results of the Peninsula Campaign. The brigade was organized on October 27, 1862, after the five regiments had arrived in Washington, D.C. The brigade's first commander was Colonel Asa P. Blunt, commander of the 12th regiment, who was the ranking colonel. Brigadier General Edwin H. Stoughton arrived on December 7, and assumed command of the brigade. Stoughton was not popular with the officers and men of the brigade, so when he was captured by Confederate partisan John S. Mosby on March 9, 1863, few mourned his loss. Colonel Blunt assumed command of the brigade again, turning it over to the new brigade commander, Brigadier General George J. Stannard, on April 20, who led the brigade until the Battle of Gettysburg.  Defense of Washington  The brigade spent most of its short career in the defenses of Washington, in and around Fairfax, Virginia. From October 1862 until February 1863, it served as the 2nd Brigade, (Brigadier General John J.) Abercrombie's Division, Military District of Washington. In a reorganization in February 1863, the division came under command of Brigadier General Silas Casey and the military district was reorganized as the XXII Corps. In April, Abercrombie resumed command of the division. The 13th, 14th and 15th regiments were stationed at Camp Chase, Arlington, Virginia until October 28, then joined the 12th and 16th at East Capital Hill by October 30, when the brigade moved to Munson's Hill, thence to Hunting Creek several days later, where it conducted picket duty on Occoquan Creek, until mid-December. On December 12, the brigade moved to Fairfax Court House, where it remained until late March 1863, when it moved to Wolf Run Shoals. Several of the regiments were camped independently or in pairs at Bristoe Station, Catlett's Station, Manassas, Warrenton Junction and Rappahannock Station until late June, when they were consolidated at Union Mills in mid- to late-June. The only excitement to break the tedium of picket duty occurred on December 29, 1862, when Fairfax Court House was attacked by J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry, and March 9, 1863, when Stoughton was captured. But all that was to change when Lee's Army of Northern Virginia started marching north in late June.  Gettysburg Campaign  On June 25, the brigade was assigned as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, I Corps, and ordered to follow the rest of the Army of the Potomac north. The 12th and 15th regiments were detached at Westminster, Maryland, on July 1, to guard supply trains, and the remaining regiments arrived on the battlefield late that evening, and camped to the rear of Cemetery Hill. On the morning of July 2, the brigade remained massed in the rear of Cemetery Hill. In the afternoon, Stannard was given command of the infantry supporting batteries on the left flank. The brigade was moved forward some, and the 14th and 16th regiments engaged to check advancing Confederates and help close up the Union line on the left flank of Cemetery Hill. The 13th regiment engaged some Georgian troops who were trying to capture a battery, approaching the Emmitsburg road. Members of the regiment, led by Captain John Lonergan, approached and surrounded the Codori farm house, and captured 80 soldiers from an Alabama regiment. Colonel Wheelock G. Veazey of the 16th regiment was detailed as the division field officer of the day. On the morning of July 3, members of the 16th regiment were stationed as pickets forward of Cemetery Hill. In the afternoon, after a two-hour artillery duel, Confederate General Robert E. Lee launched what has become known Pickett's Charge. The Vermont pickets were withdrawn, and as the Confederates approached Cemetery Hill, the three Vermont regiments flanked the Confederate troops first flanking Pickett's division by wheeling two units to the right and then doing the same to two detached Confederate brigades by wheeling two regiments to the left. Stannard's brigade inflicted severe casualties on the advancing Confederate regiments and forcing some of Pickett's men to redeploy covering their right flank. History recalls this battle as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. Three years later, at St. Albans, Vermont, General George G. Meade, commanding the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, said \\"there was no individual body of men who rendered greater service at a critical moment than the comparatively raw troops commanded by General Stannard.\\"Crockett, iii:563.  After the battle  Col Francis V. Randall assumed command of the brigade after Stannard was wounded. On July 4, the 12th regiment was sent to Baltimore, Maryland to transport and guard prisoners. The 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th regiments participated in the pursuit of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia starting July 4, but broke off and were ordered back to Vermont between July 8 and July 18. Some of them tarried at New York City to assist in controlling the Draft riots, but by August 10, all five regiments had mustered out at Brattleboro, Vermont. A total of 4,847 men served in the five regiments of the brigade. It suffered at total of 356 casualties during its career, including 70 killed or mortally wounded at Gettysburg, 282 lost to disease, 2 who died in Confederate prisons, 1 who committed suicide, and 1 who was murdered.

He was a member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU), President of the RAOU 1939–1940, and editor of its journal the Emu from 1926 to 1928. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the RAOU in 1941 and the previous year he had been the first recipient of the Australian Natural History Medallion for his work in ornithology and popularising natural history. Chisholm was a prolific and popular writer of articles and books, mainly on birds and nature but also on history, literature and biography.  Early life  Alec H. Chisholm was born on 28 March 1890 at Maryborough, Victoria, seventh of eight children. His father was Colin Chisholm, an Australian-born grocer, and his wife Charlotte, née Kennedy, from Scotland.Tess Kloot, 'Chisholm, Alexander Hugh (Alec) (1890–1977)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, (MUP), 1993 He was educated at Maryborough State School until the age of 12.  Conservationist  By the time he began work as a journalist, Chisholm already had a name as a conservationist. In 1907, aged seventeen, he joined the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and during the next year wrote six articles in the organisation's journal, the Emu. In the Maryborough and Dunolly Advertiser he campaigned in 1908 against the killing of egrets for feathers for women's hats, a crusade in which he won support from Australian poet Dame Mary Gilmore. In 1911 he was employed at the newspaper as a journalist, leaving in 1915 for a position at the Brisbane Mail. He continued to campaign for the conservation of Australia's birds, animals and plants for the rest of his life. Personal life On 8 November 1923 Chisholm married Olive May Haseler in Brisbane. They had one daughter, Deirdre, who was born on 26 December 1924. From 1964, Olive Chisholm's health deteriorated seriously. Alec cared for her as best he could until late 1968, when she was committed to Balmoral Hill Convalescent Home, where she died in 1970. By this time, his own health was in serious decline, although he continued living alone in a small flat in Sydney's Cremorne Point until his death in 1977.  Journalist and editor  Chisholm worked as a journalist in Queensland from 1915 to 1922, then moved to Sydney, where he became news editor of the Daily Telegraph and later editor of the Sunday Pictorial. After moving to Melbourne in 1933, he was for many years editor of the Australasian, before being appointed editor of The Argus in June 1937. He spent ten years, from 1948 to 1958, editing the ten-volume Australian Encyclopaedia, for which he was awarded the Order of the British Empire. Chisholm was also editor of The Victorian Naturalist and Who's Who in Australia. In his late years he wrote several entries on ornithologists, naturalists and explorers in the Australian Dictionary of Biography. He was a contributor of articles to a number of publications, including Walkabout, the latter mostly on Australian bird life and history.  Historian  Visiting England in 1938, Chisholm discovered a large number of documents relating to the nineteenth-century ornithologist John Gould. They included the diary kept by Gould's principal collector, John Gilbert, during his participation in Ludwig Leichhardt’s 1844-45 expedition to Port Essington. This diary became the foundation of Chisholm's 1941 book, Strange New World. He published several later works of history, but none achieved the popularity or notoriety of his Gilbert and Leichhardt book.

An Indian design, the Kaveri was originally intended to power production models of the HAL Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) being built by the Aeronautical Development Agency. However, the Kaveri programme failed to satisfy the necessary technical requirements or keep up with its envisaged timelines and was officially delinked from the Tejas programme in September 2008. Snecma, on a tie up with DRDO, is slated to revive and certify the engine as part of the offsets deal for 36 Dassault Rafale jets purchased by India.DRDO ties up with Snecma to revive engine for Tejas Business Standard 21 November 2016 As of 7th February 2020, India and Uk are jointly developing an engine which would be based on the Eurojet EJ200 afterburning turbofan, it is expected this engine would be placed in the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft. The deal is expected to be signed soon. History  Programme  In 1986, the Indian Defence Ministry's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was authorized to launch a programme to develop an indigenous powerplant for the Light Combat Aircraft. It had already been decided early in the LCA programme to equip the prototype aircraft with the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engine, but if this parallel program was successful, it was intended to equip the production aircraft with this indigenous engine. The DRDO assigned the lead development responsibility to its Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE), which had some experience in developing jet engines. It had developed the GTX37-14U after-burning turbojet, which first ran in 1977, and was the first jet engine to be designed entirely in India. A turbofan derivative, the GTX37-14UB, followed. The GTRE returned to turbojet technology with the greatly redesigned, but unsatisfactory, GTX-35. For the LCA programme, the GTRE would again take up a turbofan design which it designated the GTX-35VS \\"Kaveri\\" (named after the Kaveri River). Full-scale development was authorized in April 1989 in what was then expected to be a 93-month programme projected to cost . A new engine typically costs up to $2 billion to develop, according to engine industry executives. Development The original plans called for 17 prototype test engines to be built. The first test engine consisted of only the core module (named \\"Kabini\\"), while the third engine was the first example fitted with variable inlet guide vanes (IGV) on the first three compressor stages. The Kabini core engine first ran in March 1995. Test runs of the first complete prototype Kaveri began in 1996 and all five ground-test examples were in testing by 1998; the initial flight tests were planned for the end of 1999, with its first test flight in an LCA prototype to follow the next year.There has been much criticism of the degree of realism in the DRDO's planning schedules for various elements of the LCA programme, most particularly for the Kaveri development effort. France's Snecma, with over half a century of successful jet engine development experience, took nearly 13 years to bring the Rafale fighter's M88 engine to low-volume production after bench testing had begun; a similar timespan for the less-experienced GTRE would see Kaveri production beginning no earlier than 2009. (See Reddy, C. Manmohan (16 September 2002). LCA economics . The Hindu However, progress in the Kaveri development programme was slowed by both political and technical difficulties. In 2002, little information had been publicly released concerning the nature of the Kaveri technical challenges, but it was known that the Kaveri had a tendency to \\"throw\\" turbine blades, which required securing blades from SNECMA (as well as digital engine control systems).Anon. (30 May 2002). Snecma Aerospace India: a new stage in cross- border collaboration . SAFRAN Group website Le Webmag. Retrieved from \\"Military Aviation and Defense\\" section 14 September 2006. Continuing development snags with the Kaveri resulted in the 2003 decision to procure the uprated F404-GE-IN20 engine for the eight pre-production Limited Series Production (LSP) aircraft and two naval prototypes. The ADA awarded General Electric a 105 million contract in February 2004 for development engineering and production of 17 F404-IN20 engines, delivery of which is to begin in 2006. In mid-2004, the Kaveri failed its high-altitude tests in Russia, ending the last hopes of introducing it with the first production Tejas aircraft.Since India does not possess suitable aircraft, the high-altitude testing of the Kaveri is contracted to Russia, which uses a Tu-16 bomber for the purpose. Another Kaveri engine was delivered to Russia for further flight testing from June to September 2006, but on an Il-76 testbed instead of a Tu-16. This unfortunate development led the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) to order 40 more IN20 engines in 2005 for the first 20 production aircraft, and to openly appeal for international participation in completing development of the Kaveri. In February 2006, the ADA awarded a contract to SNECMA for technical assistance in working out the Kaveri's problems.Jackson, Paul; Munson, Kenneth; & Peacock, Lindsay (Eds.) (2005). \\"ADA Tejas\\" in Jane's All The World's Aircraft 2005-06. Coulsdon, Surrey, UK: Jane's Information Group Limited. p. 195. . In December 2004, it was revealed that the GTRE had spent over on developing the Kaveri. Furthermore, the Cabinet Committee on Security judged that the Kaveri would not be installed on the LCA before 2012, and revised its estimate for the projected total development cost to .Pandit, Rajat (16 July 2006). IAF may not get to fly LCA before 2010. The Times of India. In April 2005, \\"There is good progress\\" on the development of the Kaveri engine, M. Natarajan, Scientific Adviser to the Defense Minister told The Hindu. \\"We are planning to integrate a prototype Kaveri engine into one of the LCA prototypes sometime in 2007 to understand the nuances of such a complex power-pack,\\" he further told The Hindu. In February 2006, the US experts told pti that \\"Kaveri is truly a world-class engine.\\" \\"We are ready to join in partnership with the Defence Research and Development Organisation to make Kaveri work,\\" General William J Begert of Pratt and Whitney, told PTI. But DRDO secretary Natrajan told PTI that \\"But Kaveri is and would remain an Indian project.\\" On 5 February 2007, Scientific Adviser to Defense Minister M Natarajan said nearly 90 to 93 per cent of the expected performance had been realized and the government had recently floated an expression of interest to seek partners to move the programme further.Anon. (5 February 2007). Rediff.com, Rediff news website. Retrieved from \\"Rediff.com\\" on 15 May 2007. Till 11 February 2008, Kaveri had undergone 1,700 hours of tests and has been sent twice to Russia to undergo high-altitude tests for which India has no facility. The engine is also being tested to power the next generation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.Uutlookindia.com  wired In July 2007, GTRE divided Kaveri program into two separate programs. They are K9+ Program and K10 Program. K9+ Program is a program to prove concept of complete design and gain hand-on experience of aircraft engine integration and flight trials to cover a defined truncated flight envelope prior to the launch of production version of K10 Standard engine. While K10 Program is a joint venture (JV) partnership with a foreign engine manufacturer. K10 program engine will be final production standard Kaveri engine and shall have less weight and more reheat thrust along with certain other changes to meet the original design intent. In September 2008, it was announced that the Kaveri would not be ready in time for the Tejas, and that an in-production powerplant would have to selected. Development of the Kaveri by the GTRE would continue for other future applications. It was announced in November 2008 that the Kaveri engine will be installed on LCA by December 2009,Kaveri in LCA by 2009 apparently for tests only. In February 2009, it was published in Flightglobal that the GTRE had spent in developing the Kaveri engine since 1989, but the power-plant is still overweight and does not have the of thrust that its customer requires. Natarajan told Flightglobal that the programme will not be scrapped. \\"A team of air force engineers is working with GTRE and ADA in addressing the issues. As an ongoing project, the air force will be involved at the point of integrating the upgraded version of the engine with the aircraft,\\" he told Flightglobal. \\"Discussions with Snecma have been going on for two years,\\" he further adds. \\"Development and flight-testing of the new engine will take at least five to six years.\\"Flightglobal.com In December 2009, Kaveri-Snecma JV was trying Back-door Entry in LCA. The People's Post reported that GTRE has agreed to de-link Kaveri from LCA, but has put in a proposal that when the first 40 GE-404 engines in the initial two squadrons of the LCA for the IAF, get phased out should be replaced by the Kaveri-Snecma engine, in future. On 3 May 2010, about 1880 hours of engine test had been completed on various prototypes of Kaveri Engine. A total of eight Kaveri Engines and four core engines have been manufactured, assembled and tested. High Altitude testing on core engine has been completed successfully. In June 2010, the Kaveri engine based on Snecma's new core, an uprated derivative of the M88-2 engine that powers the French Rafale fighter, providing of maximum thrust is being considered an option by DRDO. A press release in August 2010, stated that GTRE with the help of Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) of Russia is trying to match objective of fine tuning of Kaveri engine performance. Until August 2010, one major milestone which is altitude testing, simulating Kaveri engine performance at different altitude and achieving speed of Mach 1 had been completed successfully. One of Kaveri prototype (K9) was successfully flight tested at Gromov Flight Research Institute in Moscow, on 4 November 2010. The test was conducted at the Flying Test Bed at Gromov, with the engine running right from the take-off to landing, flying for a period of over one hour up to an altitude of . The engine helped the IL-76 aircraft test bed fly at speeds of 0.6 Mach in its maiden flight, according to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). \\"The engine control, performance and health during the flight were found to be excellent. With this test, Kaveri engine has completed a major milestone of development programme,\\" it added. After completing these milestone Kaveri engine is flight-worthy. The Kaveri engine was tested for the first time on a flying testbed and the trials were a success. Till April 2011, the first phase of Kaveri engine FTB trials have been completed successfully and further tests will continue from May 2011 onwards. The flight tests successfully carried out so far are up to maximum altitude and a maximum forward speed of 0.7 Mach. In its annual report for 2010–11, The Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that had been spent on development, with only two out of the six milestones prescribed having been met. Among its deficiencies, CAG says the engine weight was higher than the design specifications, being against , and there was no progress on developing the compressor, turbine and engine control systems.Deccan Chronicle New Report On 21 December 2011, \\"9 prototypes of Kaveri engines and 4 prototypes of Kabini (Core) engines have been developed\\" told by the then Defence Minister AK Antony in Rajya Sabha. Further on, 2050 hours of test flight of engines has been taken place so far. 27 flights for 55 hours duration have been completed on testbed IL-76 aircraft as well as maximum forward altitude and a maximum forward speed of 0.7 Mach had been recorded. ;Problems The Kaveri program has attracted much criticism due to its ambitious objective, protracted development time, cost overruns, and the DRDO's lack of clarity and openness in admitting problems. Much of the criticism of the LCA program has been aimed at the Kaveri and Multi-Mode Radar programs. There has been much criticism of the degree of realism in the DRDO's planning schedules for various elements of the LCA programme, most particularly for the Kaveri development effort. France's SNECMA, with over half a century of successful jet engine development experience, took nearly 13 years to bring the Rafale fighter's M88 engine to low-volume production after bench testing had begun; a similar timespan for the less-experienced GTRE would see Kaveri production beginning no earlier than 2009.Reddy, C. Manmohan (16 September 2002). LCA economics . The Hindu. Another criticism has been DRDO's reluctance to admit problems in the engine and its resistance to involve foreign engine manufacturers until the problems became too large to handle. In August 2010, regarding the reasons for delay, a Ministry of Defense press release reported: # \\"Ab-initio development of state-of-the-art gas turbine technologies. # Technical/technological complexities. # Lack of availability of critical equipment & materials and denial of technologies by the technologically advanced countries. # Lack of availability of test facilities in the country necessitating testing abroad. # Non availability of skilled/technically specialized manpower.\\" Current status The DRDO currently hopes to have the Kaveri engine ready for use on the Tejas in the latter half of the 2010s decade and according to latest news still research on it is going on and the time to complete its research has been extended to 2011-2012. \\"In recent times, the engine has been able to produce thrust of but what the IAF and other stake-holders desire is power between \\", senior officials told The Hindu. \\"On using the Kaveri for the LCA, they said the engine would be fitted on the first 40 LCAs to be supplied to the IAF when they come for upgrades to the DRDO in the latter half of the decade.\\" Article further adds that in 2011, 50-60 test flights will be carried out to mature the engine in terms of reliability, safety and airworthiness. India's Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) aims to integrate the Kaveri power-plant with the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) Tejas fighter within the next nine months. A test aircraft operated by India's Aeronautical Development Agency will be used for the integration, says an industry source familiar with the programme. If the integration is successful, the GTRE hopes to see a Tejas fly with a Kaveri power-plant by the end of 2013. In Lok Sabha on 10 December. 2012 Defence Minister A K Antony gave an update on the progress made by the Kaveri Engine Development Project as follows: # So far, 9 prototypes of Kaveri Engine and 4 prototypes of Kabani (Core) Engine have been developed. # 2,200 hours of test (ground and altitude conditions) has been conducted. # The following two major milestones have been achieved: ## Successful completion of Official Altitude Testing (OAT) ; and ## Demonstration of First Block of flight of Kaveri Engine in Flying Test Bed (FTB). Kaveri Engine was integrated with IL-76 Aircraft at Gromov Flight Research Institute (GFRI), Russia and flight test was successfully carried out up to maximum altitude and maximum forward speed of 0.7 Mach. Twenty Seven flights for 57 hours duration have been completed. DRDO demonstrated its technological capability in aero-engine technology. This has been a great achievement in the aerospace community of the country, when the first ever indigenously developed fighter aircraft engine was subjected to flight testing. Tacit knowledge acquired by the DRDO scientists during this project will also be applied for further aerospace technology. Kaveri spin-off engine can be used as propulsion system for Indian Unmanned Strike Air Vehicle (USAV). In January 2013, the GTRE director said that they are abandoning the plan for co-development with Snecma, but they still need an overseas partner, which will be selected through competitive bidding. In November 2014, The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) decided to abandon the Kaveri engine (GTX-35VS ) programme due to its shortcomings. Foreign help On 4 July 2016, according to Indian media report, France offered to invest EUR 1 billion to revive India's combat jet engine project, proposing a joint development plan that could see the stalled Kaveri gas turbine powering indigenous Tejas fighters by 2020. On 20 November 2016, DRDO Director General for Aeronautics Cluster C P Ramanarayanan confirmed that DRDO and French Snecma have tied up to revive Kaveri Engine as part of the offsets deal for 36 Rafale jet. It is expected that the engine would be integrated and tested in LCA Tejas by 2018. In 2018, La Tribune reported that French Snecma will help in production of the Kaveri by sharing M88's technology. Design A low- bypass-ratio (BPR) afterburning turbofan engine featuring a six-stage core high-pressure (HP) compressor with variable inlet guide vanes (IGVs), a three- stage low-pressure (LP) compressor with transonic blading, an annular combustion chamber, and cooled single-stage HP and LP turbines. The development model is fitted with an advanced convergent-divergent (\\"con-di\\") variable nozzle, but the GTRE hopes to fit production Tejas aircraft with an axisymmetric, multi-axis thrust-vectoring nozzle to further enhance the LCA's agility. The core Turbojet engine of the Kaveri is the Kabini. The general arrangement of the Kaveri is very similar to other contemporary combat engines, such as the Eurojet EJ200, General Electric F414 and Snecma M88. It has a very low bypass ratio (0.16:1). Similar low amounts of bypass on earlier engines, required only for afterburner and nozzle cooling,Design For Air Combat, Ray Whitford 1987, Jane's Publishing Company Limited, , p.140 introduced the term \\"'leaky' turbojet\\". The Kaveri engine has been specifically designed for the Indian operating environment, which ranges from hot desert to the highest mountain range in the world. The GTRE's design envisions achieving a fan pressure ratio of 4:1 and an overall pressure ratio of 27:1, which it believes will permit the Tejas to \\"supercruise\\" (cruise supersonically without the use of the afterburner). Plans also already exist for derivatives of the Kaveri, including a non-afterburning version for an advanced jet trainer, and a high-bypass-ratio turbofan based on the Kabini core.Mama, Hormuz (November 1998). LCA Update . Flight International via Bharat-Rakshak.com.

It sits on the banks of the Cromarty Firth overlooking the Black Isle, the \\"big meadowland\\", from which it takes its name. The Dalmore distillery is owned and operated by Whyte & Mackay, which is owned by Philippines based Emperador Inc.\\"Philippines firm Emperador buys Whyte & Mackay for £430m\\" History The legend of The Dalmore dates back to 1263, when Colin of Kintail, Chief of the clan Mackenzie, saved King Alexander III of Scotland from a charging stag. As a reward the grateful King, granted Colin of Kintail the lands of Eilean Donan, the motto ‘Luceo Non Uro’, which translates to ‘I Shine, Not Burn’ and the right to use the 12-pointed Royal Stag as the Mackenzie clan crest. The distillery was established in 1839 by entrepreneur Alexander Matheson, who after 28 years decided it was time to pass the distillery onto new owners. Andrew and Charles Mackenzie came forward, and as members of the clan Mackenzie they brought with them the iconic 12-pointed Royal Stag emblem, the caberfeidh which has adorned every bottle of The Dalmore. Operations ran fairly smoothly at the distillery until 1917, when the British Royal Navy began to use the firth next to the distillery as a site for the production of deep-sea mines. In 1920 much of the distillery was destroyed by an explosion and the fire that came as a result of a mine detonation incident. The subsequent legal battle between Andrew Mackenzie and the Royal Navy lasted over half a decade, even reaching the House of Lords. The distillery remained family-owned until 1960 when one of Dalmore's main customers, Whyte & Mackay, took control. A significant contributor to W&M;'s blends, for many years Dalmore's presence in the world of single malt was restricted to a 12-year-old expression. In recent times, however, the range has expanded dramatically, with a core range of 12, 15, 18 and 25-years-old, plus no-age-statement specialties like King Alexander III, Cigar Malt, and an ever-growing selection of luxury expressions such as the 21-strong Constellation range, and 1951 \\"Sirius\\". Prices at the top end regularly top five figures. Process The water used in the Dalmore is taken from the river Alness, which runs through the small town of Alness, where the distillery is located. The waters of the river flow from the nearby Loch Morie, located deep in the heart of the Northern Highlands. The location of the Dalmore's distillery and its smooth, floral flavor qualify it as a Highland malt. The wash stills at Dalmore have flat tops, and are also in two sizes. Three are in capacity, the fourth is double that. The spirit stills all sport water coolers around their necks to assist in reflux. Again, one of the quartet is double the size. Because of this discrepancy in size and the fact that the spirit stills are charged when the low wines and feints receiver is full, the strength of the charge to those stills varies, creating different end flavors. Though it seems random to an outsider, thankfully it is controlled by high experienced stillmen. All these distillates are vatted before being casked. Condensing is also unusual. The spirit stills have external shell and tube condensers which lie horizontally. This mirrors the old worm pipe which lay in the burn which runs outside the stillhouse. Each expression of The Dalmore is matured in two different types of wooden casks: American white oak bourbon casks and exclusive aged sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass. Each sherry cask – which is hand selected by master distiller Richard Paterson – gives the whisky a deep copper colour and flavours of crushed almonds, cinnamon, ginger and citrus. The bourbon casks give the whisky notes of vanilla, spice, honey and tropical fruits. To create a more complex character, selected expressions are finished in exceptional casks, showcasing woods from world-renowned bodegas and exclusive wineries. Whiskies  Products currently produced  * The Dalmore 12-year-old Matured for an initial nine years in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, the spirit is then divided. One half remains in the bourbon barrels, while the other is transferred to exclusive 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before they are reunited to create this whisky. * The Dalmore 15-year- old This vintage is initially matured for 12 years in American white oak ex- bourbon casks. The Dalmore 15 is then split equally between three different sherry woods; Amoroso, Apostoles and Matusalem oloroso for a further three years. The spirit is finally married together in an upstanding sherry butt, allowing the flavors to infuse. * The Dalmore Cigar Malt Matured initially in American white oak ex-bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts, it is then transferred into Cru Cabernet Sauvignon wine barriques. * The Dalmore 18-year-old Matured initially for 14 years in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, the spirit is then transferred to 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts for a further four years. These sherry butts from the house Gonzalez Byass are selected exclusively for The Dalmore. * The Dalmore King Alexander III Spirits matured in ex-bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry butts, Madeira barrels, Marsala casks, Port pipes and Cabernet Sauvignon wine barriques are combined in perfect harmony to create a complex, yet smooth single malt. * The Dalmore 25-year-old Matured initially in American white oak, the whisky is divided into rare hand-sourced 25 year old sweet Palomino Fino sherry butts and 1980 first fill bourbon casks. These whiskies are then married together in bourbon barrels before being transferred, for the final time into Tawny Port pipes from Portugal. * The Dalmore Valour – Travel Retail Exclusive Valour marries together the distinct characteristics of three exceptional casks. Matured initially in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, the spirit is then transferred to 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry wood casks from Gonzalez Byass, before being finessed in Port pipes from the Douro region in Portugal for a unique finish. * The Dalmore Constellation Collection The Dalmore Constellation Collection unites a spectrum single malt scotch whisky vintages distilled between 1964 and 1992.  Limited edition products  * The Paterson Collection This collection has been created to honor the people who have shaped, influenced and inspired the 50-year career of the Dalmore's master distiller, Richard Paterson. The twelve individual expressions encompass some of the distillery's oldest and rarest whiskies, Richard creates a tribute to William Taylor, Charles Chree Doig, Alexander Matheson, Andrew MacKenzie, Douglas Cooper, John MacDonald, Donald MacKinlay, Andrew Usher, his Grandfather and Father, Drew Sinclair, Aeneas Coffey and J Whyte & C MacKay. * Trinitas The Dalmore Trinitas is a 64 year old single malt. Named Trinitas as only three bottles were produced, it contains some of the oldest and rarest whiskies in the world, dating from 1868, 1878, 1926 and 1939. * The Drew Sinclair An expression created by Master Distiller Richard Paterson as a tribute to Andrew ‘Drew’ Sinclair, who was Distillery Manager for many of his 40 years at The Dalmore. * Eos Named after the Titan goddess of the dawn, Eos is a 59 year old expression crafted from two outstanding sherry casks. The casks were left to mature from 1951 before both were combined to create this truly brilliant whisky. * Selene The Dalmore Selene brings together two exceptional sherry casks, number 1781 and 1782, both had been left to mature since 1951. Over half a century passed before the Dalmore Master Distiller deemed it the time right to combine them and create this 58 year old whisky. * Oculus The Dalmore Oculus was a unique release. Only one bottle was created using a combination of rare malts from 1868, 1878, 1922, 1926, 1939 and 1951. The Oculus was encased in an engraved Baccarat crystal decanter, within a wooden display case. * Sirius Only 12 decanters of the Dalmore Sirius existed in the whole world of this 1951 vintage. Named Sirius after the brightest star in the sky, the whisky is presented in a decanter with starburst engraving and iconic solid silver stag. * Candela The Dalmore Candela is a 50 year old expression that has been selected from the oldest maturing stocks of any single Highland malt whisky, it contains spirits dating from 1868, 1878, 1909, 1922, 1939 and 1951. * Aurora The Dalmore Aurora is a 45 year old single malt. The flavors and aromas of Aurora are created during a 45-year maturation in hand selected oak casks from the house of Gonzalez Byass. * Astrum Named after the Latin word for constellation, this 40 year old expression emerged from the darkness of a lengthy maturation. The Astrum was sealed into American white oak casks in 1966. Four decades later it was given a final flourish of 18 months in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. * Ceti This 30 year old expression of The Dalmore is named after the Ceti star which is 30 light years away from earth. As the brightest star in its constellation, the Ceti also reflects the Mackenzie Clan motto ‘Luceo Non Uro’, translated as ‘I shine, not burn’. Ceti began with a 23 year long maturation in hand selected American white oak ex- bourbon barrels, before spending a further seven years in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts sourced from bodega Gonzalez Byass. * Vintage 1979 The journey of this vintage began on 29 October 1979, when the spirit was put into bespoke bourbon barrels. After a 29-year maturation, it was transferred to Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Jerez de la Frontera for the final two years. * 1981 Matusalem After an initial period of 22 years in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, the 1981 Matusalem is aged for six years in Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. * 1981 Amoroso The 1981 Amoroso spent the first 26 years in American white oak bourbon barrels before a short, intense period in Amoroso sherry casks from bodega Gonzalez Byass. * Mackenzie In 1263, the Chief of the Clan MacKenzie saved King Alexander III from being gored by a stag whilst out hunting. The grateful King granted him the right to bear a 12-pointed Royal Stag in his coat of arms. Descendants of the Clan took over The Dalmore distillery in 1867 and from then on, every bottle of The Dalmore single malt whisky has been adorned with the emblem. Master Distiller, Richard Paterson, created The Mackenzie expression as a tribute to this act of bravery. The vintage was initially matured in American white oak for 11 years, then transferred to Port pipes from Oporto for a further six years. * Castle Leod A homage to the Clan Mackenzie whose history is entwined with The Dalmore distillery, this 1995 vintage was the second in a series crafted by Master Distiller, Richard Paterson. It honors the Clan, who's seat is still to this day at Castle Leod, and is found only 25 miles from The Dalmore Distillery. Initially matured in American white oak and Spanish sherry wood, it then spends a final 18 months in barriques from a first cru classe Bordeaux Chateau. * Cromartie This expression was crafted as a tribute to the lands of Cromarty: the seat of the Clan Mackenzie and their home Castle Leod. Locked deep within Castle Leod is an ancient map depicting the lands of Cromarty drawn up in 1762 as part of the government's order to map ‘rebels estates’. The map adorns each gift box . The vintage was first put into American white oak ex-bourbon casks before being transferred to Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from world-renowned bodega Gonzalez Byass. * Daniel Boulud Chef Daniel Boulud worked with Richard Paterson to create this bespoke expression using aged stocks from Muscatel, Madeira, and Port. Record price * On 15 April 2005, a bottle of 62-year-old Dalmore was sold by Denis Barthe, Bar Manager of the Ascot Bar at Pennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot Surrey, for £32,000. The blend was a mix of five casks, from 1868, 1878, 1922, 1926 and 1939. Only 12 bottles were produced. * In 2010 the distillery completed production of Dalmore Trinitas, so called because only three bottles were produced. The first two bottles sold for £100,000 each. According to the distillery website, the final bottle was sold in Harrods in London for £120,000 in 2011. *In 2013, The Dalmore created the Paterson Collection, in homage to its Master Distiller Richard Paterson.

He plays for Ireland in Tests, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, with his first appearance for the national side coming in 2005. He was one of the eleven cricketers to play in Ireland's first ever Test match, against Pakistan, in May 2018. In June 2018, he was named captain of Ireland's T20I side, a role he held until November 2019. He has played county cricket for Derbyshire, having previously appeared for Surrey. He was Surrey captain for the latter part of the 2014 season, following injury to Graeme Smith, Surrey v Leicestershire and was awarded his cap in the same season. Wilson signed a three-year contract with Derbyshire on 19 September 2016, and the following year, he captained the club to the quarterfinals of the T20 Blast, only the second time Derbyshire had gone so far in the competition. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full- time basis.

In 1929, he was a founder of the investment brokers, Paige, Smith, and Remick, serving as senior partner until 1937 and remaining a member for more than 60 years. In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Smith as special assistant in the Office of Production Management (later War Production Board). He left this post to serve in the United States Army during the Second World War. He served overseas and by the end of the war reached the rank of Lieutenant colonel. As a successful businessman, he became the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Committee. Ambassador to Cuba In June 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Smith ambassador to Cuba, replacing Arthur Gardner. Smith was a businessman who had never held a diplomatic position and who did not speak Spanish.Book Excerpt The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L. Matthews of the New York Times On arrival, Smith was urged by his staff to leave Havana to get a better feel of the country, which was in a state of some turmoil. On a visit to Santiago de Cuba, Smith witnessed firsthand the funeral and burial of Frank Pais, one of the leaders of the M-26-7 movement. After his death, well over 200,000 people attended the event, which convinced Smith that something had to be done about the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Smith was also critical of what he perceived as Washington's ambivalent attitude towards the growing 26th of July movement led by Fidel Castro. Smith felt that the CIA underestimated the strength of the revolutionary movement.Kirkpatrick, Lyman B. (Jr.).“Chapter 7: Batista's Cuba”. The Real CIA. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1968. Smith resigned his post on January 20, 1959 and was replaced by Philip Bonsal, three weeks after the Cuban Revolution led by Castro. From his 1962 book, The Fourth Floor, Smith’s remark is often quoted: “Whenever I asked President Batista for Cuba's vote to support the United States in the United Nations, he would instruct his Foreign Minister to have the Cuban delegation vote in accordance with the United States delegation and to give full support to the American delegation at the United Nations.” In Richard E. Sprague’s 1976 book The Taking of America, 1-2-3, Smith’s wife is listed among those who have been assassinated.Sprague, Richard E. “Chapter 10: Techniques and Weapons and 100 Dead Conspirators and Witnesses”. The Taking of America, 1-2-3 (PDF). 1976. (1st Ed.) p. 75 Later life In 1960, Smith testified to the Senate Committee on the subject of the \\"Communist threat to the United States through the Caribbean.\\" During the hearings, Smith said, \\"Until Castro, the U.S. was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the Cuban president.\\"Kellner, Douglas. Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara (World Leaders Past & Present). Chelsea House Publishers, 1989. (p. 66) He also presented the lawmakers with the following options: Smith was named the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland by President Kennedy, but declined because Switzerland was charged with United States relations in Cuba. In the 1980s, he was named to the Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Cuba by President Ronald Reagan alongside George W. Landau. Personal life Smith was married four times and divorced twice. His marriage was on January 7, 1926 to Consuelo Vanderbilt (1903–2011), a daughter of the former Virginia Graham Fair and William Kissam Vanderbilt II. Consuelo, the sister of Muriel Vanderbilt, was also a granddaughter of William Kissam Vanderbilt, Alva Belmont, James Graham Fair, and a niece of Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and, her namesake, Consuelo Vanderbilt (the former Duchess of Marlborough from her marriage to Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough). Before their 1935 divorce, they were the parents of two daughters: * Iris Vanderbilt Smith (1927–2006), who married Herbert Pratt Van Ingen, Augustus G. Paine III, Edwin F. Russell, and Donald C. Christ. * Virginia Consuelo Smith (b. 1930), who married William Langdon Hutton and Edwin Marston Burke. The year after their divorce, Consuelo remarried to Henry Gassaway Davis III (the heir to a coal fortune who was recently divorced from her cousin, Grace Vanderbilt, a daughter of Grace and Cornelius Vanderbilt III). Smith remarried to Mimi Elaine Richardson (1916–1995) on December 28, 1936. Mimi, a graduate of Miss Porter's, was a daughter of Courtlandt Richardson of New York. They divorced in November 1939, and she married William Gamble Woodward Jr. in December 1940. In 1947, Smith was married to model Florence Pritchett Canning (1920–1965). Flo, as she was known, was the former wife of Richard Canning. After her 1943 divorce from Canning, she met John F. Kennedy in 1944, with whom she may have dated. They remained friends into the early 1960s. Pritchett was also romantically linked to actors Robert Walker and Errol Flynn. She worked as the fashion editor for New York Journal-American and wrote articles for Photoplay. She appeared as a panelist on the radio and TV program Leave It to the Girls from 1945 to 1953. Before her death in 1965, they were the parents of: * Earl Edward Tailer Smith Jr. (b. 1953) After the death of his third wife in 1965, he married for the fourth, and last, time to the former Lesly H. Stockard at the Atlanta County Courthouse in March 1968. Lesly, a daughter of Lester Napier Stockard, was the former wife of John Barker Hickox and James Langley Van Alen (son of Margaret Van Alen Bruguiére).

The programmes are drawn up by the Penang Arts Council every year and are partly sponsored by the YTL Group of Companies, a corporate patron of the arts scene in Malaysia. Penang is also home to the indigenous boria, a fading art form with singing and dancing once popular among the local Malay community. Lion dance is an ancient art form brought from China by early Chinese immigrants, and over time has evolved into a distinctive Malaysian style. The earliest record of lion dancing in Malaysia was the official registration of a Penang lion dance troupe back in 1903 but it is indisputable that the Chinese community had been practising it long before then. The Chinese place special significance to this dazzling form of art, associating it good luck, power, strength, majesty and happiness. Today lion dance remains actively performed especially during Chinese New Year and also during the opening of new businesses.

Wesak Day is considered as most sacred celebration for the Buddhists as the day commemorates with Lord Buddha's birth, enlightenment and final Nibbana. Wesak Day's night procession is an annual event organised in Penang since 1949 until present days. It was organised entirely by Buddhist community in Penang and funded through donations. The annual grand float procession usually starts at 6.00 pm in the evening, from the Malaysian Buddhist Association in Burma Road. The procession floats are beautifully decorated with colourful flowers and bright lights. Buddhist monks will conduct chanting and sprinkling holy water throughout the procession journey. Thaipusam is an annual religious event celebrated by Hindus to commemorate the victory of Lord Murugan over the demons. It falls on a full moon day on the Tamil tenth month of Thai. Devotees and penitents can seen bearing kavadis, and piercing their bodies with hooks and spears without seeming to cause any pain or harm as an act of faith and atonement. The centre of the celebration takes place at the Nattukkottai Chettiar Temple Penang at Waterfall Road where the chariot procession ends. As in other places with a substantial population of Chinese people, Chinese New Year is a grand affair in Penang, celebrated with firecrackers, worshipping at temples, lion dance, sumptuous feasts and open houses.

The Hindu festival Deepavali, also known as the Festival of Lights, celebrates the triumph of good over evil. The Zhong Yuan Festival (known in Hokkien as Phor Tor (普度)) is celebrated on a grand scale by the Penang Chinese. The Chinese believe that on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, the gates of underworld would open and the dead souls whom without any descendants to conduct ancestral worship for them would be allowed to roam in the living realm to receive food and offerings. The Chinese would placate the 'hungry ghosts' by organizing big worship celebration that include religious rituals, burning incense, making food offerings and performing Chinese opera or getai on makeshift stages. At the end of the month-long festival, a giant effigy of Da Shi Ye (大士爷) who is maintaining the law and order of the 'hungry ghosts' will be sent off and burned. Throughout the month, it is ill-advised to travel, go out at night or to get marry. This tradition is more popular among Oversea Chinese communities because many Chinese migrants in the past often passed away without any offspring or descendants, therefore they do not have anyone to conduct the ancestral worship for them. Many Oversea Chinese communities will therefore conduct grand seventh lunar month worship celebration as a way to honour those Chinese migrants.

There are six major orthodox (astika) schools of Hindu philosophy — Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta. Among the various orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya, Yoga and Mimamsa, while not rejecting either the Vedas or Brahman, typically reject a personal God, creator God, or a God with attributes. Some schools of thought view the path of atheism as a valid one but difficult to follow in matters of spirituality.  Etymology  The Sanskrit term ' (\\"pious, orthodox\\") refers to the systems of thought which admit the validity of the Vedas. Sanskrit ' means \\"there is\\", and ' (per Pāṇini 4.2.60) derives from the verb, meaning \\"one who says '\\". Technically, in Hindu philosophy the term refers only to acceptance of authority of Vedas, not belief in the existence of God. However, even when philosophers professed allegiance to the Vedas, their allegiance did little to fetter the freedom of their speculative ventures. On the contrary, the acceptance of the authority of the Vedas was a convenient way for a philosopher's views to become acceptable to the orthodox, even if a thinker introduced a wholly new idea. Thus, the Vedas could be cited to corroborate a wide diversity of views; they were used by the Vaisheshika thinkers (i.e., those who believe in ultimate particulars, both individual souls and atoms) as much as by the Advaita Vedanta philosophers.  Historical development  The Rig Veda, the oldest of the Vedas, deals with significant skepticism around the fundamental question of a creator God and the creation of the universe. It does not, at many instances, categorically accept the existence of a creator God. Nasadiya Sukta (Creation Hymn) in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda states: The Brihadaranyaka, Isha, Mundaka (in which Brahman is everything and \\"no-thing\\") and especially the Chandogya Upanishads have also been interpreted as atheistic because of their stress on the subjective self. Mimamsa was a realistic, pluralistic school of philosophy which was concerned with the exegesis of the Vedas. The core text of the school was the Purva Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini (c. 200 BCE–200 CE). Mimamsa philosophers believed that the revelation of the Vedas was sacred, authorless (apaurusheyatva) and infallible, and that it was essential to preserve the sanctity of the Vedic ritual to maintain dharma (cosmic order).Encyclopædia Britannica (2007) As a consequence of the belief in sanctity of the ritual, Mimamsas rejected the notion of God in any form. Later commentators of the Mimamsa sutras such as Prabhākara (c. 7th century CE) advanced arguments against the existence of God. The early Mimamsa not only did not accept God but said that human action itself was enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits. Samkhya is not fully atheistic and strongly dualistic orthodox (Astika) school of Indian Hindu philosophy. The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the Samkhyakarika (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa. The Samkhyakarika is silent on the issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.  Arguments against existence of God in Hindu philosophy  Mimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. They further thought that the Gods named in the Vedas had no physical existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods. Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas. Samkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God: * If the existence of karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God. * Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion. * Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self. * Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakriti as the origin of the world, not God. Therefore, Samkhya maintained not only that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God, but that God as normally understood—an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator who is free from suffering—cannot exist. The Indian Nobel Prize-winner Amartya Sen, in an interview with Pranab Bardhan for the California Magazine published in the July–August 2006 edition by the University of California, Berkeley states:\\"The Arguing Indian\\" California Magazine According to Markandey Katju, former Chairman of the Press Council of India and former judge of the Supreme Court of India, \\"...there are six classical systems of Indian philosophy, Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Sankya, Yoga, Purva Mimansa and Uttar Mimansa, and three non-classical systems, Buddhism, Jainism and Charvak.

The reproduction of color scenes in black-and-white tones is one of the long- time concerns of photographers. A tone reproduction curve is often referred to by its initials, TRC, and the 'R' is sometimes said to stand for response, as in tone response curve. In photography In photography, the differences between an \\"objective\\" and \\"subjective\\" tone reproduction, and between \\"accurate\\" and \\"preferred\\" tone reproduction, have long been recognized. Many steps in the process of photography are recognized as having their own nonlinear curves, which in combination form the overall tone reproduction curve; the Jones diagram was developed as a way to illustrate and combine curves, to study and explain the photographic process. The luminance range of a scene maps to the focal-plane illuminance and exposure in a camera, not necessarily directly proportionally, as when a graduated neutral density filter is used to reduce the exposure range to less than the scene luminance range. The film responds nonlinearly to the exposure, as characterized by the film's characteristic curve, or Hurter–Driffield curve; this plot of optical density of the developed negative versus the logarithm of the exposure (also called a D–logE curve) has central straight section whose slope is called the gamma of the film. The gamma can be controlled by choosing different films, or by varying the development time or temperature. Similarly, the light transmitted by the negative exposed a photographic paper and interacts with the characteristic curve of the paper to give an overall tone reproduction curve. The exposure of the paper is sometimes modified in the darkroom by dodging and/or burning-in, further complicating the overall tone reproduction, usually helping to map a wider dynamic range from a negative onto a narrower print reflectance range. In digital photography, image sensors tend to be nearly linear, but these nonlinear tone reproduction characteristics are emulated in the camera hardware and/or processing software, via \\"curves\\". In printing In printing, a tone reproduction curve is applied to a desired output-referred luminance value, for example to adjust for the dot gain of a particular printing method. Dot-based printing methods have a finite native dot size. The dot is not square, nor any other shape that when stacked together perfectly fills an image area; rather, the dot will be larger than its target area and overlap its neighbors to some extent. If it were smaller than its target area, it would not be possible to saturate the substrate. A tone reproduction curve is applied to the electronic image prior to printing, so that the reflectance of the print closely approximates a proportionality to the luminance intent implied by the electronic image. It is easier to demonstrate the need for a TRC using halftoned printing methods such as inkjet, or xerographic technologies. However, the need also applies to continuous-tone methods such as photographic paper printing. As an example, suppose one wants to print an area at 50% reflectance, assuming no ink is 100% reflective and saturated black ink is 0% (which of course they aren't). The 50% could be approximated using digital halftoning by applying a dot of ink at every other dot target area, and staggering the lines in a brick-like fashion. In a perfect world, this would cover exactly half of the page with ink and make the page appear to have 50% reflectivity. However, because the ink will bleed into its neighboring target locations, greater than 50% of the page will be dark. To compensate for this darkening, a TRC is applied and the digital image's reflectance value is reduced to something less than 50% dot coverage. When digital halftoning is performed, we will no longer have the uniform on- off-on-off pattern, but we will have another pattern that will target less than 50% of the area with ink. If the correct TRC was chosen, the area will have an average 50% reflectance after the ink has bled. A TRC can be applied when doing color space conversion. For example, by default, when transforming from L*A*B* to CMYK, Photoshop applies an ICC profile for SWOP standard inks and 20% dot gain for coated paper.

He was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India from Outer Delhi as a member of the Indian National Congress but resigned from the primary membership of the party after he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a case relating to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/why-gujarat-2002-finds-mention- in-1984-riots-court-order-on-sajjan-kumar-1963730 Political career In 1977, Kumar was sworn in as the Delhi Councillor by prominent social activist Guru Radha Kishan. He was first elected to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi at a time when only few congressman were able to win in Delhi, and was later appointed General Secretary, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), Delhi. In 1980, he elected to 7th Lok Sabha, and was a Member, Consultative Committee, Ministry of Works and Housing in the Lok Sabha. At the time, he was a Sanjay Gandhi loyalist and a bakery owner. In 1991, he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha, and then again in 2004 when he won by the largest number of votes ever in India, 855,543, representing Indian National Congress in outer Delhi. Following his election in 2005, he served as Member, Committee on Urban Development and Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme. Investigations and conviction for role in anti-Sikh riots  PUDR & PUCL fact-finding report In 1984, a fact-finding team jointly organized by People's Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) and the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) concluded that attacks on members of the Sikh community in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots were not from spontaneous outrage over the assassination of Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, but rather the result of deliberate planning by important politicians of the Indian National Congress party. The investigators found that the member of parliament who was most commonly named by Sikh riot survivors for being responsible for the attacks in Delhi locality of Sultanpuri was Sajjan Kumar. Similarly, Sikh riot survivors in the locality of Mangolpuri nearly unanimously named Kumar as having \\"masterminded the violence\\". They alleged that Kumar had given Rs. 100 and a bottle of liquor to each attacker in the riots. The investigators also observed Sikh riot survivors confront Kumar directly at the Mangolpuri police station accusing him of being responsible for the riots. Later, Kumar attempted to provide food aid to hungry Sikh survivors at a refugee camp, but the refugees refused it saying that he was behind the riots in the first place.  Delhi Police Investigation  Prior to 2005, the Delhi Police had investigated Kumar's role in the riots. The investigation was then given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2005 by recommendation from the Justice G.T. Nanavati Commission. In the subsequent investigation, the CBI concluded that there was a conspiracy of \\"terrifying proportion\\" between Kumar and the police during the riots, and that the Delhi police had systematically removed Kumar's name from all eyewitness testimony of the riots.  CBI Investigation  In 2010, as a result of the CBI investigation, Kumar was tried for murder, dacoity, mischief to cause damage to property, promoting enmity between different communities, criminal conspiracy, and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Eyewitnesses testified how Sajjan Kumar had colluded with the police and incited mobs to kill Sikhs.1984 riots: Sajjan Kumar provoked mob to kill my father, witness tells court In 2012, the CBI prosecutor told a Delhi court that riots targeting the Sikhs had the \\"patronage\\" of Sajjan Kumar. CBI alleged that he organised anti-Sikh riots and he along with five others are being tried at court for killing six Sikh people. Trial and Conviction In April 2013, the Karkardooma district court in Delhi acquitted Sajjan Kumar, while convicting five others, leading to protests. On 27 August 2013, the Delhi High Court accepted an appeal filed by the CBI against Kumar's previous acquittal by a lower court. CBI stated that the trial court \\"erred in acquitting Sajjan Kumar as it was he who had instigated the mob during the riots\\". He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court on 17 December 2018 for his role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. On 18 December 2018, he resigned from his party Indian National Congress. His lawyer said they will appeal in the Supreme Court of India.

The name is thought by some historians to be a corruption of the original Verulamstead. Flamstead stands on a ridge above the River Ver, which runs on its north side; to the south the village extends downhill to the adjoining hamlet of Trowley Bottom. The first documented record of the village was in 1006, and it was also recorded in the Domesday Book eighty years later. In the Middle Ages it was important enough for a market and fair to be held there, though it is now mainly a dormitory village for neighbouring towns, several of which can be reached by bus from the village. The current population is around 1,306. Buildings St Leonard's Church From a distance the village is dominated by the parish church of St Leonard, with its characteristic \\"Hertfordshire Spike\\" spire. St Leonard’s (Church of England) is believed to stand on the site of a ninth-century Saxon chapel, though the oldest parts of the present structure date from around 1140. Features of interest include mediaeval wall paintings, the Saunders Memorial of 1670, and a fine fifteenth century rood screen. The village also has a Methodist church, Other notable buildings in Flamstead include the almshouses in the High Street, built in 1669; the Three Blackbirds pub opposite (one of three in the village), partly dating from the sixteenth century; and several attractive cottages of similar age. Flamstead has 65 listed buildings. Flamstead has a pre-school and a primary school, though older local children have to travel to secondary schools elsewhere in Hertfordshire. The present school dates from the late 1950s, and the previous school building adjacent to the churchyard is now used by the pre-school and also as the Village Hall. Beechwood Park School, now a preparatory school, was once the site of a Benedictine nunnery and then a Tudor mansion. It lies in the parish, though it is closer to the neighbouring village of Markyate. Beechwood Park gave its name to a song by The Zombies, written by the group's bassist Chris White, who grew up in Markyate. History The Old Watling Street in the parish, as its name suggests, follows the route of the original Roman road. The modern A5 runs roughly parallel with it but closer to the River Ver. In 2008 Channel 4's Time Team discovered a previously unknown major Roman temple complex near Watling Street at nearby Friar's Wash. The programme about the dig was first broadcast on 4 January 2009. Since 2002, an annual Scarecrow Festival has been held in Flamstead to raise funds for the upkeep of the church and for local charities. Since 2014 the village has held a Literary Festival - Books in the Belfry - attracting best-selling authors including Tony Parsons, Sophie Hannah, Jane Hawking, Jonathan Stroud, Alex Scarrow, Clare Mulley, Ian Ridley and Michael Calvin. Proceeds go to restoration of medieval wall-paintings in the village church.

The First Piano Sonata in 1946, a Second Piano Sonata in 1948, and a Third Piano Sonata was composed in 1955–57 with further elaborations up to at least 1963, though only two of its movements (and a fragment of another) have been published. First Piano Sonata Boulez's First Piano Sonata, completed in 1946, has two movements. It was his first twelve-tone serial work (together with his Sonatine for flute and piano), and he originally intended to dedicate it to René Leibowitz, but their friendship ended when Leibowitz tried to make \\"corrections\\" to the score (, quoted without a page reference in ). Second Piano Sonata Pierre Boulez's Second Piano Sonata series consists of three cells: A) a perfect fifth followed by a tritone and perfect fourth; B) a descending perfect fifth followed by an ascending major second, descending augmented fifth, and ascending major second; and B1) B inverted . The Second Piano Sonata of 1947–48 is an original work which gained Boulez an international reputation. The pianist Yvette Grimaud gave the world premiere on 29 April 1950 . Through his friendship with the American composer John Cage, the work was performed in the U.S. by David Tudor in 1950 . The work is in four movements, lasting a total of about 30 minutes. It is notoriously difficult to play, and the pianist Yvonne Loriod \\"is said to have burst into tears when faced with the prospect\\" of performing it . Tom Service listed it as one of ten key Boulez compositions . Third Piano Sonata The Third Piano Sonata was first performed by the composer in Cologne and at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1958, in a \\"preliminary version\\" of its five-movement form. A subsequent Darmstadt performance by the composer, on 30 August 1959 in the Kongresssaal Mathildenhöhe, was recorded and has been released commercially on CD2 of the seven-disc boxed set, Neos 11360, Darmstadt Aural Documents, Box 4: Pianists ([Germany]: Neos, 2016). One motivating force for its composition was Boulez's desire to explore aleatoric music. He published several writings, both criticizing the practice and suggesting its reformation, leading up to the composition of this sonata in 1955–57/63. Boulez has published only two complete movements of this work (in 1963), and a fragment of another (in ), the other movements having been written up to various stages of elaboration but not completed to the composer's satisfaction. Of the unpublished movements (or \\"formants\\", as Boulez calls them), described in , the one titled \\"Antiphonie\\" is the most fully developed. It has been analysed by Pascal . The formant titled \\"Strophe\\" is the one least developed since the preliminary form but: > a 1958 radio tape of the composer's Cologne performance of the Third Piano > Sonata shows that the wealth of cross-reference introduced by the inclusion > of the other three movements, even in their preliminary versions, > contributes exponentially to the complex, multiform effect of the whole. A facsimile of the manuscript of the preliminary version of the remaining formant, \\"Séquence\\", was published in Schatz and Strobel 1977, but was subsequently continued to nearly twice its original length .

Hydroxycut was originally developed and manufactured by MuscleTech Research and Development; MuscleTech was sold to Iovate Health Sciences in 2003–2004 and declared bankruptcy in 2005; Iovate continues to use MuscleTech as a brand to market Hydroxycut. Since 2013, the primary ingredients in the product line include caffeine, lady's mantle extract (Alchemilla vulgaris), wild olive extract (Olea europaea), cumin extract (Cuminum cyminum), wild mint extract (Mentha longifolia), and, in some products, green coffee bean extract (Coffea canephora). Before the 2004 reformulation, formulations contained ephedra, a supplement banned by the FDA in 2004. Before the 2009 reformulation, formulations contained several substances with potential to harm the liver. After a series of reports in the medical literature of serious liver problems, including one death, the FDA warned consumers to stop using Hydroxycut, and Iovate agreed to voluntarily recall the products. The harm caused by Hydroxycut products has led to calls for stricter regulation of the dietary supplement industry and to calls within the industry for more rigorous safety testing.  Marketing and sales  Hydroxycut is sold at conventional retailers, online retailers, and through direct television marketing. Like many dietary supplements, published studies demonstrating scientific evidence of its effectiveness and safety is lacking. In March 2013, Sean Lowe became the brand ambassador for Hydroxycut Hardcore. In the same month, IndyCar racer Tony Kanaan announced he will pilot the No. 11 Hydroxycut IndyCar at the Indianapolis 500 along with 8 other events at the 2013 IndyCar Championship. Hydroxycut has been promoted as being created and endorsed by doctors. Television advertisements for Hydroxycut featured a medical resident, although reporters were unable to locate him after Hydroxycut was removed from the market in 2009.

March 4, 2009, pp. 499–516 Thousands of lawsuits were filed over ephedra in the early 2000s; the first lawsuits against MuscleTech began in 2000 and by 2004 there were about 80 pending. In 2003 and 2004, most of the assets of the MuscleTech group of companies were sold off to other companies, including Iovate Health Sciences; the same person controlled MuscleTech and Iovate. MuscleTech filed for bankruptcy in June 2005 and the claims of litigants against MuscleTech were resolved by 2007. Since then, MuscleTech has become a brand of Iovate, under which Hydroxycut products are sold.Iovate's Linked-in page Iovate Health Sciences operates as a subsidiary of Kerr Investment Holding Corp.Staff, BloombergBusinessWeek.

Accessed March 31, 2013  Pre-2004 formulations  Prior to 2004, some formulations of Hydroxycut contained ephedra. There were reports of seizures in people who had ingested Hydroxycut, which were attributed to the ephedra and caffeine in the product. As a result, there were around 80 pending ephedra lawsuits against MuscleTech. In 2003, Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon filed a lawsuit in St. Louis against Hydroxycut's manufacturer, MuscleTech, stating that its marketing claims that Hydroxycut was \\"clinically proven\\" to be a \\"fat-burner\\" were false. Nixon also alleged that \\"MuscleTech's own consultants had serious concerns about the safety of Hydroxycut, but the company continued to market the product.\\" MuscleTech paid $100,000 to settle the case and agreed to cease marketing ephedra-containing products in Missouri and to refund customers' money. The New York Times reported in 2003 that internal documents from MuscleTech indicated that the company had buried studies showing that Hydroxycut was ineffective, covered up evidence of cardiac side effects, and even tampered with the documents it submitted as evidence in a lawsuit in Oklahoma. In 2004, the FDA banned ephedra after 155 deaths from heart attack and stroke were attributed to ephedra, including the death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler. It was the first banning of a dietary supplement by the FDA.Death at the ballpark: a comprehensive study of game-related fatalities of … By Robert M. Gorman, David Weeks. McFarland Press. p. 64.  Pre-2009 formulations  By 2009, about 15% of Americans had tried taking dietary supplements for weight loss, and Hydroxycut was the biggest seller, with about a million units sold each year. However, Hydroxycut formulations contained several substances with potential to harm the liver such as hydroxycitric acid. Scientific evidence of serious side effects from Hydroxycut products accumulated, including liver failure (requiring liver transplantation in some cases), rhabdomyolysis, and at least one death, of a 19-year-old man who used the product. On May 1, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to consumers to stop using Hydroxycut products, due to 23 reports of serious health problems associated with the use of Hydroxycut, and at least one death, and to destroy any product that they may possess. The warning stated \\"Although the liver damage appears to be relatively rare, FDA believes consumers should not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Consumers who have these products are urged to stop using them.\\" Following the FDA warning, the manufacturer then agreed to voluntarily recall the products.  Post-2009 formulations  After the 2009 recall, Hydroxycut was reformulated and placed back on sale, and the FDA confirmed that the only ingredient left from prior formulations was caffeine.Lorraine Heller for NutraIngredients-USA.com, September 8, 2009. Reformulated Hydroxycut back on shelves As of 2013, its primary ingredients include caffeine. Lady's mantle extract (Alchemilla vulgaris), Wild olive extract (Olea europaea), Cumin extract (Cuminum cyminum), Wild mint extract (Mentha longifolia) and, in some Hydroxycut products, Green coffee bean extract (Coffea canephora robusta). Following the reformulation, case reports in the medical literature have continued to link Hydroxycut to serious side effects.

Accessed March 30, 2013 Another case published in 2013 reported on a patient who developed ulcerative colitis due to Hydroxycut Hardcore.  Reactions  The Hydroxycut case has been cited as emblematic of the weak regulation of dietary supplements in the U.S. Defenders of the nutritional supplements industry said that the recall demonstrated that the FDA has the power to protect consumers from toxic products, while critics cited it as evidence that the FDA's powers over dietary supplements need to be expanded. While some diet supplement executives defended the safety of Hydroxycut and believed the media \\"over-hyped\\" the FDA withdrawal, others questioned why Iovate had not published long-term safety or efficacy studies on the final Hydroxycut products, and used weak trial duration and sample sizes. This is despite having the money to perform such studies and their self-definition as a \\"research-oriented\\" company. The editors of the nutrition trade journal Nutrition Business Journal noted that this recall \\"will ultimately be a good thing for the dietary supplement industry if it encourages weight-loss supplement manufacturers to care as much about their products' safety and efficacy as they do about expanding and protecting their bottom lines.\\" In a paper published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in October 2010, Hydroxycut was cited as an example of \\"current and former weight loss products backed by potentially conflicted or low quality research.\\" It noted that \\"Marketing materials for Hydroxycut cited two published studies asserting product effectiveness that were small, of short duration, reported no serious side effects, and did not disclose relationships between authors and the product manufacturer or that funding was received from the product manufacturer.\\" The paper noted that at least three studies supported the safety and effectiveness for weight loss of Cissus quadrangularis (CQ), which is an ingredient used in one of the reformulated Hydroxycut products, but \\"lack financial disclosures or funding sources, beyond mentioning that the CQ being tested was provided by\\" General Health Alliances, an herbal products manufacturer. The studies did not disclose that one of its authors was a chief scientific officer for GHA that holds a patent on a CQ product.

It originally aired on November 20, 1995, in broadcast syndication. The story was created by Richard Danus and was turned into a teleplay by Hans Beimler. The episode was directed by Star Trek: The Next Generation alumnus LeVar Burton, and featured the return of John Colicos as Kor. Colicos had first appeared as Kor in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\", and had previously appeared in this series in the episode \\"Blood Oath\\". Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, Kor returns to the station to recruit Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) to help to find the ancient Sword of Kahless. After they find the sword, they are forced to evade the forces of Toral (Rick Pasqualone), Son of Duras, and Worf and Kor come to blows over the future use of the weapon. The episode was the first in the series to feature the character of Worf, who had previously been a character on The Next Generation, in a central storyline. Due to time restraints in filming, there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously. The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, including the use of Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Plot Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's bar telling stories of past battles to his friend Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She introduces Kor to her colleague Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn). He explains that he is on a quest to find the legendary Sword of Kahless, the founder of the Klingon Empire; he has come into possession of a shroud which he believes once held the Sword. When he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword. Jadzia verifies the authenticity of the shroud, and the next morning she, Kor, and Worf depart for the Gamma Quadrant to search for the Sword on the planet where the shroud was found. On the planet, they discover a secret chamber in an underground vault containing the Sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras, who hired the Lethean and wants the Sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to their ship, they head into the adjoining cave system in order to try to escape Toral. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons are affected by the prestige of the Sword: Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II; but Worf believes that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses to let go of the Sword. Worf grabs the other end of the Sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go. Dax helps Worf save Kor, and afterwards takes possession of the Sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and Dax tries to sleep, but is awakened by an argument between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily when Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia stuns them both with her phaser and then forces Toral to enable the three to return to their ship. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the Sword divided two men as honorable as they, it would do the same to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it. Production Writing The episode was the first to feature Michael Dorn's (right) character centrally, and was directed by LeVar Burton (left). \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was the first Deep Space Nine (DS9) episode to predominantly focus on Worf. Michael Dorn had joined the cast at the beginning of season four, but his character was not featured prominently in the first eight episodes of the season because they had been scripted prior to confirmation that Dorn would be joining the show. \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was the first episode to be written after his arrival, so it was the first time his character was featured centrally. This meant that in each of those episodes, Worf was inserted into the episode, whereas \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was the first episode to be written after his arrival and the production team wanted him to feature centrally for the first time.Erdmann; Block (2000): p. 289 The story was created by Richard Danus, who had been the executive story editor during the third season of TNG, when Ira Steven Behr joined the production team. Danus had written TNG episodes such as \\"Déjà Q\\" and co-wrote the teleplay for \\"Booby Trap\\". It was Behr who gave Danus the opportunity to write for DS9, after they became friends following Behr's arrival on TNG. The episode was directed by another former TNG actor, LeVar Burton, who described the story as something akin to the search for the Holy Grail in Klingon mythology. Hans Beimler, who converted Danus' story into a teleplay, was aware of the mythology of the Grail as he wrote the script and wanted to avoid giving the sword any mystical or magical powers. He said that \\"It's the concept of the sword that has the power. We could have said that some technology or magic gave the Klingons the feeling of power, but that would have been a cheap way to go.\\"Erdmann; Block (2000): p. 290 The writing staff was disappointed in the reaction of many fans, who wanted a technological explanation for the effects of the sword. Filming, casting and music Because of limited time to film, several edits were made to the script by Beimler. Some of the scenes set in the cave sets were dropped as they would have taken too long to set up. Kor, Worf and Dax were in almost every scene of the episode and so time could not be saved by filming more than one scene at a time.Erdmann; Block (2000): p. 291 The cave sequences were filmed on the cave standing sets on stage 18 of Paramount Studios. The sets were limited, so Burton said that in order to make it look like the characters were moving through a complex labyrinth of caves, he and director of photography Jonathan West used the sets' depth to make them look like different parts of the caves. The precipice that Kor nearly falls down was created by filming the actors on the second level of the cave sets and then matting the footage onto a long miniature version of the cave that Gary Hutzel created out of aluminium foil. The production staff also spread sand onto the floor of the cave sets in order to make it look different from other episodes in which the sets had been used. Burton advised Farrell on the aggressiveness Dax should show in her interactions with Kor and Worf in the episode, a type of performance which both Burton and Farrell later nicknamed \\"Action Barbie\\". John Colicos had appeared as Kor once before on DS9, in the second-season episode \\"Blood Oath\\". In The Original Series first-season episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\", Colicos had portrayed Star Treks first main character Klingon.Gross; Altman (1995): p. 40 Rick Pasqualone appeared as Toral, son of Duras, in \\"The Sword of Kahless\\". Originally, the character, played by JD Cullum, was introduced in the TNG two-part episode \\"Redemption\\", when he sought the leadership of the Klingon High Council alongside his aunts Lursa and B'Etor. Worf has history with the House of Duras, dating back to the rivalry between Worf's father, Mogh, and Toral's grandfather, Ja'Rod. Composer David Bell created music for the episode that had echoes of the operas of 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner. He explained that he used \\"Wagner opera vocabulary in the orchestrations, and ... actually used Wagner tubas in the score\\". He used religious tones to accompany appearances of the sword itself, specifically when it is first found by Worf, and said, \\"If the audience isn't made to understand the spiritual importance of that weapon, then we have no episode\\". Props Several replica bat'leths, with a replica sword of Kahless on the top Dan Curry created the Klingon weapon, the bat'leth, while working on TNG. Its first appearance was in the episode \\"Reunion\\" and has appeared in all live action series of Star Trek with the exception of The Original Series. The sword in \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was intended to be the first bat'leth made by, according to Klingon mythology, Kahless himself, which he used to defeat the tyrant Molor and unite the Klingon people for the first time in their history. It was decided that the sword needed to be different from other bat'leths seen on the show, and so a new hardened aluminium prop was ordered after numerous designs by John Eaves were considered on paper. As with the original bat'leth, Dan Curry created the prop. Sculptor Dragon Dronet then etched designs into the blade by hand using dental tools. The producers requested designs on the blade similar to the effects seen in Damascus steel, which was combined with Dronet's idea of forming these into a topographic map, with an effect described as being \\"as if you're staring down at mountains\\". Klingon names were then added to the side of the weapon. Dronet also created the stand for the sword out of plexiglas which was spray-painted to look metallic. The legs of the stand were carved to look like the feet of the Klingon animal, the targ.Erdmann; Block (2000): p. 292 \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" also featured new prop designs for Starfleet-issued over-the-shoulder bags and the camping equipment used in the cave sequences. Reception and home media release \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was first broadcast on November 20, 1995, in broadcast syndication. It received Nielsen ratings of 6.9 percent, placing it in tenth place in its timeslot and lower than the episode that aired the previous week, \\"Little Green Men\\", which gained a rating of 7.1 percent. \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" received a higher rating than the following episode, \\"Our Man Bashir\\", seen by 6.8 percent of viewers. Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Michelle Erica Green, who watched the episode in April 2013 for TrekNation, thought that it was not a typical Deep Space Nine episode and that it required knowledge of Worf's history from The Next Generation. She said that the episode was \\"admirable for a drama that takes place mostly walking through uninteresting cave sets\\". She thought that towards the end, it became a little \\"mumbo-jumbo-mystical\\" but that it was in \\"perfect keeping with the Klingons\\". However, she felt that the episode again relied on Jadzia's past as Curzon Dax and that the ending would have been better with Toral stealing the sword at the last minute so that it could be followed up with in a later episode. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website Jammer's Reviews compared the episode to an Indiana Jones story and said that it was a \\"enjoyable fable for a simpler time\\". He praised the musical score by David Bell and thought that the episode was the perfect vehicle for Worf, saying that Michael Dorn gave a strong performance. He gave the episode a rating of three and a half out of four. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club in January 2013, said that the plot was similar to the plots of stories such as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927). He felt that the episode showed a side of Worf that had not been seen before, and that Worf had exhibited a \\"willingness to go to absolute lengths to do what he believes needs to be done\\". He compared it to the anger bubbling under the surface of Bruce Banner in the 2012 film The Avengers. In 2015, Geek.com rated the scene where Worf holds the Kahless artifact as one of the top 35 moments in Star Trek. In 2017, The Daily Dot recommended this as a Star Trek Klingon alien themed episode to prepare for Star Trek: Discovery. The first home media release of \\"The Sword of Kahless\\" was as a two-episode VHS cassette alongside \\"Our Man Bashir\\" in the United Kingdom on June 13, 1996, followed in the United States and Canada by a single-episode release on October 3, 2000. It was later released on DVD as part of the season four box set on August 5, 2003.

Filmed in the United Kingdom, it was released in 2007 in Europe and in January 2008 in the United States. It was developed as a British- French-American co-production. The film was premiered in secret at Avilés, Spain on June 18, 2007. It was officially premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 2, 2007 and was already in theaters in Spain by November 3. The film had its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2007.TIFF '07 - Films and Schedules Cassandra's Dream Plot Brothers Terry (Colin Farrell) and Ian (Ewan McGregor), who live in South London, were raised by a weak father Brian (John Benfield) who runs a restaurant, and a strong mother Dorothy (Clare Higgins) who taught her sons to look up to their uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson), a successful plastic surgeon and businessman. The brothers buy a sailboat at an oddly low price, despite its near pristine condition. They name it Cassandra's Dream, after a greyhound that won Terry the money to buy the boat. Knowing nothing of Greek mythology, they are unaware of the ominous antecedents of this name—the ancient prophetess Cassandra, whose prophecies of doom went unheeded by those around her. While driving home from a day's sailing in a borrowed car, Ian crosses paths with beautiful actress Angela Stark (Hayley Atwell), with whom he becomes infatuated. Terry has a gambling addiction that sinks him deeper in debt. Ian wishes to invest in hotels in California to finance a new life with Angela. To overcome their financial problems, they ask Howard for help. He agrees to help them, but asks for a favor in return: they must murder someone for him. Howard faces imprisonment for unspecified crimes and his future is threatened by Martin Burns (Phil Davis), a former business partner who plans to testify against him. Howard asks his nephews to get rid of Burns, and in return he will reward them financially. After initial reluctance, the brothers agree. They make two zip guns, untraceable and easily destroyed. Lying in wait in Burns' home, their plan is foiled when Burns arrives with a woman. Their resolve shaken, they leave and agree to commit the murder the next day. The next day, they succeed in carrying out the murder and later destroy the guns. Ian is content to move on as if nothing happened, but Terry is consumed by guilt and begins abusing alcohol and other drugs. His behavior frightens his fiancée (Sally Hawkins), who tells Ian about the situation and that Terry believes he has killed someone. After Terry confides that he wants to turn himself in to the police, Ian goes to Howard for advice. They agree there is no alternative but to get rid of Terry. Ian plans to poison Terry during an outing on the boat. Ian can't bring himself to kill his own brother, and attacks him in a fit of rage. In the chaos, Terry knocks Ian down the steps into the cabin, killing him. The boat is later discovered adrift by the police, and the audience learns that Terry snapped and drowned himself after killing his brother. The last shot is of Cassandra's Dream, still in beautiful condition despite the tragedies it set in motion. Cast Soundtrack This is the first Woody Allen film since Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) to have an original score commissioned for it. The score was composed by Philip Glass. It was also his first film released with a stereo soundtrack. Allen previously eschewed stereo although often employing Dolby Stereo and Dolby Digital technologies to convey a higher quality mono soundtrack. The film is stereo for its music only. Critical response The film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score 46% based on reviews from 116 critics. Another aggregator Metacritic gave the film an average rating score of 49 out of 100, based on 31 reviews. Manohla Dargis commended the film in her review for The New York Times. Although offering criticism such as the film feeling \\"too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch,\\" she suggests that Allen's film \\"is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn't just stop making comedies once and for all.\\" Roger Ebert compared the film negatively to Sidney Lumet's similarly themed Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, adding: \\"The Lumet film uses actors who don't look like brothers but feel like brothers. Allen's actors look like brothers but don't really feel related.\\" He rated the film two out of four stars, and noted that Allen's previous film Match Point presented the material more effectively. Damon Wise of Empire magazine concluded that Cassandra's Dream was \\"[a] clumsy, clichéd morality play that may actually represent the lowest point of Allen's recently chequered career.\\" Paul Jordan also compared the film to a morality play—but considered that praise: \\"Allen gets past the guard of a modern audience which would not have taken seriously the appearance of a Mephistopheles or an Old Scratch. Uncle Howard is a chilling 21st Century Tempter, fulfilling the heart's desire in return for murder and leading his nephews to terrible perdition.\\"Paul Jordan, \\"Persistent Myths,\\" p. 17 In his \\"Best of the Decade\\" article, New Yorker critic Richard Brody called Cassandra's Dream one of the best films of the 2000s: \\"Few aging directors so cogently and relentlessly depict the grimly destructive machinery of life, and every time the word 'family' is uttered, the screws tighten just a little more.\\" In 2016 film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.

Some philosophers believe causation relates facts, not events, in which case the meaning is adjusted accordingly. Some philosophers believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass- energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say). There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists. The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics. Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon counterfactual definiteness, that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B. It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects counterfactual definiteness for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).

In the vein of interactive movie games like Wild Gunman, Dragon's Lair, and Cliff Hanger, Badlands lets its players navigate through various animated sequences by pressing a single button at a precise moment (unlike Dragon's Lair, there is no joystick). Since the game is themed as an old West shooter, the function of the button is almost always the fire the main character's gun to fend off against attackers. If the player shoots too soon, he will be hanged for murder. Failing to fire in time, however, will result in being killed by the attack. As the player progresses, the timing becomes more precise. The game was very particular about firing at the right time, which made it very difficult and often unplayable. At one point Buck must shoot a snake and fire at the snake at the exact second to succeed. It is even possible for Buck to shoot himself in sequences where it shows him. Distributed by Centuri in the U.S., it was Konami's only laserdisc game. Plot The player assumes the role of Buck, a hardworking family man, whose wife and children are murdered by a band of outlaws. One by one, for his revenge on them if so, Buck tracks down the various outlaws, earning higher and higher bounties as he progresses. The final foe is the outlaw leader, Landolf. Gameplay Despite the game's apparent old west setting, its storyline sent the hero, Buck, into some noticeably non-realistic settings. For example, at one point Buck walks through a cave and ends up in a prehistoric jungle populated with dinosaurs. Also, the game provided Buck with three lives. As he lost those lives, the player would see him limp by humorously on crutches, or be humorously carried away on a stretcher — a noticeable break from the game's otherwise dark and mature themes. If the player lost his/her last life, Buck would turn into a super deformed angel during which time the \\"game over\\" text would appear. In addition, some of the game's \\"miss\\" sequences (which occur when the player loses a life) are humorous as well (including, but not limited to a scorpion giving Buck a Mohawk, or Buck being cut in half by an axe). In the end, if Buck could kill Landolph and his henches, the player would see him ride off into the sunset. The outlaws, ranked in order of their bounties, are as follows: #Gas, for $2,500 #Doug, for $2,500 #Smith, for $3,000 #Paco, for $3,000 #Bull, for $4,000 #Lloyd, for $5,000 #Liston, for $5,000 #Hawk, for $6,000 #Mary, for $7,000 #Landolf, for $10,000  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Badlands on their September 15, 1984 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade unit of the year.

It ceased operations nationwide on July 16, 2010.Galva News - January 17, 2017 Company history Founded by Earl Scheib (February 28, 1908 – February 29, 1992)Los Angeles Times in Los Angeles in 1937,Los Angeles Times the company grew quickly following World War II and by 1975 had branches in Germany and England, all company-owned, with Scheib manufacturing his own paint through a wholly owned subsidiary. Born in San Francisco on February 28, 1908, Earl moved to Southern California with his family when he was 10. A graduate of Los Angeles High School, Earl never went to college. Instead, he got a job as a gas station attendant changing oil and tires for General Petroleum Co. in the late 1920s. Not long after, he went into business with his own gas station on the corner of Whitworth and Fairfax. His neighbors soon began asking if he knew anyone who could paint their cars. So, each night, after closing time, Earl would paint cars in the station's lube garage. It didn't take long for word of Earl's painting service to spread, and soon there was more paint business than the station could handle. As a result, he sold his station, rented a \\"shack\\" on the corner of Pico and La Brea (Los Angeles), and in 1937 opened the first Earl Scheib Paint and Body. His philosophy was \\"work hard, be on time, and don't worry about how much you make.\\" It was a belief that underscored the way he ran his business. Earl Scheib's paint- coating systems were used by its company-owned paint and collision repair shops. The paint also was sold to original equipment manufacturers and architectural construction firms. Advertising Scheib began to expand nationally in the 1950s, and to raise awareness of his auto painting shops he turned to advertising. Earl Scheib marketed his shops through low-budget television commercials. Appearing on late-night television programs, Scheib soon became a national icon and celebrity, and his oft-heard sales pitch, 'I'm Earl Scheib, and I'll paint any car, any color for $29.95. No ups, no extras,' became an instantly recognizable phrase. Scheib, credited as being the first spokesperson for his own company, handled all advertising and developed and wrote his own television commercials. Scheib believed viewers would find his ads more convincing and genuine if he spoke directly to the viewers about the company's offerings. Earl Scheib also handled media buys, placing his television and radio ads carefully. As son Donald explained in a company statement: 'He'd personally call the station manager and tell him to interrupt a sponsored show at a pivotal moment and run his ad. ... So you'd be watching a show, the villain's sneaking up behind the hero with a knife, and just when he's about to plunge the knife into the hero's back ... Earl comes on the screen pitching his service.' Scheib's commercials were seen and heard on television and radio stations in more than 100 cities, and he continued to film spots until his death in 1992. Despite his fame and television ad ubiquity, son Donald claimed that Scheib was less than fond of appearing in commercials. 'In truth,' Donald Scheib said in a company statement, 'he hated doing those television spots. ... He didn't like being in front of the camera, you'd have to drag him feet-first into that studio, screaming.' Restructuring In 1999, the company began closing branches and selling company-owned properties to show a profit to shareholders. The organization reduced the number of its shops as a result of this practice, with most of its remaining centers in the western states, where rust and corrosion are less likely to be a problem.Earlscheib.com On February 18, 2009, Earl Scheib and Kelly Capital LLC, a private equity firm, announced the signing of the merger agreement. Kelly Capital LLC acquired the company in the second quarter of 2009 following shareholder approval of a merger agreement. Beginning in July 2010, the company closed certain locations and franchised off the remaining locations to shop managers, giving them the opportunity to become small business owners. Specifically, the company offered them the rights to purchase all the equipment and fixtures in their shops and to use the Earl Scheib name for their own business. Many managers took advantage and agreed to the terms, resulting in today's independent Earl Scheib paint centers. These modern Earl Scheib centers now offer paint jobs and most of today's Scheib shops also offer custom painting, collision repair and pinstriping.

There are around 200 of these fragments, each the size of a handspan or larger, making Portmahomack one of the major centres of rediscovered Pictish art. Nineteen pieces were found in and around the churchyard before 1994, and the remainder were found during formal archaeological investigations by the University of York between 1994 and 2007 Tarbat Discovery Programme. The excavation director, Martin Carver has proposed that the majority of the carved pieces originated in four monumental crosses or cross-slabs of exceptional size and elaboration, placed around the site of St Colman's Church. One of these (TR1) carried four Pictish symbols, a second (TR2) had snake-headed interlace. A third (TR10, 20), features images of a complex beast and a row of apostles carrying books. This same stone originally carried along one edge a Latin inscription, > IN NOMINE IHU XRI CRUX XRI IN COMMEMORATIONE REO... LII... DIE HAC... commemorating an unknown person. The fourth cross was covered in spiral and interlace ornament. Another large fragment, the so-called Boar Stone, has been identified as a sarcophagus lid with images of a boar and a wolf-like creature. Yet another fragment, the so-called Calf Stone, appears to belong to a shrine or screen. It depicts a bull and a cow tending to their calf. Other pieces from Portmahomack have been recognised as grave markers, incised with simple crosses. These are comparable to examples known from Iona and other early Christian sites in Argyll and western Scotland. Much of the Portmahomack sculpture has been assigned by radiocarbon dating of the layer in which it was found to the 8th century. Artistically, it has points of contact with sculpture in Iona and Northumbria, but its closest affiliation is with the great cross-slabs on other parts of the Tarbat peninsula, namely those at Hilton of Cadboll, Shandwick and Nigg, which one may perhaps assume were created by a school of masons centred on Tarbat. Together they demonstrate that the Tarbat peninsula was a prime centre of 8th-century European art. The collection also includes a number of architectural pieces which are likely to have adorned an early stone church, including a probable label-stop and a gable finial. This collection, not yet fully published, is probably the most extensive to survive from early medieval Scotland.

Legislative Ratings One of the state organizers of the Republican Liberty Caucus, Shafer is popularly associated with the libertarian wing of the Republican Party. He describes himself, however, as a \\"fiscal and social conservative.\\" He receives generally high marks from traditional conservative and libertarian organizations. In his 2012 re-election campaign, Shafer received A+ ratings from Americans for Prosperity, American Conservative Union, Georgia Family Council's Center for an Educated Georgia and National Rifle Association. He received an A rating from Georgia Chamber of Commerce. Shafer was also recognized for \\"environmental leadership\\" by Georgia Conservation Voters, a \\"moderate\\" coalition of environmental organizations. Leadership Positions Shafer was unanimously elected to serve as the 68th President Pro Tempore of the Georgia State Senate on January 14, 2013. In his campaign for President Pro Tem, Shafer won the backing of the Senate Republican Caucus at its biennial organizational meeting held at Little Ocmulgee State Park on November 15, 2012. His nominating speech before the full Senate was given by Senate Republican Leader Ronnie Chance. In a show of unity, Senate Democratic Leader Steve Henson seconded the nomination. Shafer's election was widely seen as an end to two years of infighting between Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and a faction of the Senate Republican Caucus led by the outgoing Senate President Pro Tem Tommie Williams and Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Bill Cowsert. Williams did not seek re-election, backing Cowsert who was defeated within the Senate Republican Caucus by a reported vote of 25 to 11. At the time of his nomination as President Pro Tempore, Shafer was vice chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus. He served as chairman of the Senate Science and Technology Committee from 2003 to 2006 and as chairman of the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee from 2006 until his election as President Pro Tem. He also served as an administration floor leader for Governor Sonny Perdue from 2003 to 2004. Shafer was an early supporter of Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and played a prominent role in his 2006 campaign. He served on Cagle's kitchen cabinet as an appointed member of the Senate Committee on Assignments. In 2011, when the Senate adopted new Senate Rules transferring the power of the lieutenant governor to the Senate Committee on Assignments, Shafer remained a member of the committee by virtue of being vice chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus. Shafer was the only elected leader of the caucus who maintained a cordial relationship with Cagle in his reduced state, setting the stage for him to reunify the Caucus and end the infighting two years later. Legislative record Best known as an advocate for reforming the state's budget procedures, Shafer has introduced legislation mandating zero-based budgeting, requiring budgetary surpluses to be returned to the taxpayers and requiring periodic sunset review of certain state agencies. Shafer served as floor leader to Governor Sonny Perdue but voted against Perdue's proposed 2003 tax increase. Shafer's has compiled a pro-business voting record. He was recognized as Legislator of the Year by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce in 2010 for his 99% pro-business voting record. He is also a recipient of the Guardian of Free Enterprise Award from the National Federation of Independent Business. Shafer has sponsored several major telecommunications bills, encouraging competition and protecting customer privacy. He authored legislation in 2007, dubbed the \\"Corporate Good Samaritan Act,\\" which limits the liability of corporations who provide voluntary, uncompensated assistance during times of declared disaster.Georgia Chamber of Commerce, \\"GAC Judiciary Committee\\" March 31, 2008. He introduced legislation in 2009 requiring periodic review of all state licensing boards to determine whether or not they are still needed. Shafer is also known for his advocacy of \\"nondestructive stem cell research\\" involving stem cells derived from sources other than the human embryo. In 2006, he authored legislation creating the Georgia Newborn Umbilical Cord Blood Bank, which passed in 2007 as the \\"Saving the Cure Act.\\" Shafer was recognized for his work in this area by Georgia Right to Life, which gave him its Pro-Life Hero Award. He sponsored a resolution that passed in 2007 apologizing for Georgia's eugenics laws and blaming them on Social Darwinism. In 2008, he denounced atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan as genocide and introduced legislation preventing Georgia pension funds from investing in companies that sell weapons to the Sudanese government. In 2009, he introduced and won passage of a resolution expressing support for the State of Israel in defense against terror attacks from the Gaza Strip. Shafer drew national attention in 2008 with a resolution asserting that Georgia's northern border was erroneously surveyed in 1818 and authorizing litigation to recover the disputed area. Shafer's resolution would give Georgia access and riparian rights to the Tennessee River. Shafer is a supporter of the Fair Tax. In 2009, he introduced a resolution urging the United States Congress to adopt the Fair Tax, calling for repeal of Sixteenth Amendment and expressing the will of the Georgia General Assembly to abolish the state income tax and replace it with a Fair Tax. In 2010, Shafer saw passage of his zero-based budgeting bill as well as legislation to reform transportation spending, subject state agencies to sunset review and expand Second Amendment rights. Governor Perdue vetoed all three bills. In 2011, Shafer successfully moved to override the veto of the zero based budgeting bill in the Senate. When the House failed to take up the veto, Shafer authored another zero based budgeting bill that was signed into law by Governor Nathan Deal in 2012. In 2013, Shafer introduced a constitutional amendment capping the state income tax which passed the General Assembly and was approved by the voters in the 2014 general election. = The Shafer Amendments = Shafer authored two controversial amendments significantly limiting taxation powers of local government in Fulton County. In 2005, Shafer attached an amendment to the charter of the City of Sandy Springs which prevented the mayor and council from increasing city property taxes above the existing millage rate without a referendum. Similar amendments were subsequently incorporated in the charters of the City of Milton and City of Johns Creek. More controversially, Shafer sponsored a legislative amendment prohibiting counties from collecting taxes in one area of a special services taxing district and spending those taxes in a noncontiguous area. The amendment affected only Fulton County. Senator Vincent Fort denounced the Shafer Amendment as \\"apartheid,\\" saying it prevented Fulton County from taxing wealthy, predominately white homeowners in North Fulton and spending those taxes providing services to poorer areas of South Fulton. Shafer agreed that the amendment had that effect, saying that each area should pay for its own services, but called the reference to apartheid \\"erroneous and insulting.\\" Fulton County unsuccessfully sued to overturn the Shafer Amendment, losing in front of both a Fulton Superior Court judge and the Georgia Supreme Court. = Budgetary disagreements with the Perdue Administration = Shafer supported Sonny Perdue for governor, endorsing him, contributing to his campaigns and making speeches on his behalf. He also served briefly as one of Perdue's floor leaders in the Senate. However, the two disagreed on budgetary issues. Shafer opposed Perdue's 2003 package of proposed excise and property tax increases, voting against even a scaled back version that only raised tobacco taxes. He also opposed Perdue's 2010 proposed tax on hospital bills, insisting that it be coupled with reductions in income and insurance premium taxes. Also, Shafer introduced zero-based budgeting legislation over Perdue's objections. When Shafer won passage of zero based budgeting in 2010 with Senate Bill 1, Perdue vetoed it. Shafer moved to override Perdue's veto during the 2011 legislative session. 2010 Exploratory Campaign for Lieutenant Governor In late 2008, after Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle announced that he would be running for governor in 2010, Shafer filed paperwork with the Georgia State Ethics Commission authorizing formation of a campaign committee to run for lieutenant governor. In early 2009, Shafer announced endorsements from a majority of the Republican members of the Georgia General Assembly and decisively defeated Senator Eric Johnson, who had also announced as a candidate for lieutenant governor, in straw polls held at county Republican conventions. On April 15, 2009, after Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle announced that a debilitating spinal disease was forcing him to withdraw from the race for governor and instead seek re-election as lieutenant governor, Shafer released a statement wishing Cagle well and suspending his own campaign in order to \\"reevaluate political options.\\" Shafer defeated Cagle and Johnson in a straw poll held at the Seventh Congressional District Republican Convention on April 18, 2009Gwinnett Daily Post, \\"Polls look good to Shafer\\" April 23, 2009. and at the State Convention of the Georgia Association of College Republicans held the same day. Shortly thereafter, Shafer announced that he was permanently ending his campaign, subject to Cagle's full medical recovery, and that he would instead seek re-election to the state senate. He was re-elected in 2010 at the same time that Cagle won re-election as lieutenant governor. Controversies In March 2018, the day after he filed papers qualifying to run for lieutenant governor, an unidentified lobbyist filed a complaint accusing Shafer of sexually harassing comments seven years earlier.https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt-- politics/lobbyist-files-sexual-harassment-complaint-against-georgia- lawmaker/ERcsb7xkuU8PrRA6q3wv5L/ Shafer forcefully denied the allegations, saying that the accuser was a woman he had dated in the 1990s prior to his election to the Senate and that he had never been alone with her after his election as a State Senator in 2002, producing affidavits from his staff saying he had instructed them never to schedule events with her or allow her to meet with him alone on his office. The Senate Ethics Committee retained independent counsel to investigate the complaint. The independent counsel found that “it is more likely that Sen. Shafer did not make sexually harassing comments and demands to (the lobbyist) than it is likely that he did, and that it is more likely that the (lobbyist) has fabricated her allegations of sexually harassing conduct than it is likely that she is telling the truth.” The report stated that the lobbyist changed her story during the investigation, acknowledging that she had never been alone with Shafer but claiming the alleged harassment was by telephone. The lobbyist produced no records of the alleged harassing calls but Shafer produced telephone records for a five year period showing that the alleged calls had not taken place. The ethics panel dismissed the complaint, stating that “no evidence” had been uncovered to corroborate the complaint and that the evidence uncovered had “contradicted the essential elements of the complaint.” Personal Shafer is married and lives in Duluth, GeorgiaAJC Political Insider, \\"Like your drivers ed teacher said: The right-of-way often belongs to he who takes it\\" June 4, 2008. with his family.

The game was released on February 8, 2007 in Japan, August 14, 2007 in North America, and October 18, 2007 in Australia by Atlus, and in Europe the following day by Rising Star Games. The game features voiced scenes, character designs by Kaito Shibano and music by Akari Kaida, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Mitsuda's studio, Procyon. Along with the main gameplay, there is an online multiplayer battle option. The game has a sequel, Luminous Arc 2, that was released in 2008. Luminous Arc 3: Eyes was released on December 10, 2009 in Japan. The latest entry in the series, Luminous Arc Infinity, was released for the PlayStation Vita in Japan on August 6, 2015. Gameplay Luminous Arc is a tactical role-playing game and uses a battlefield grid viewed from an isometric perspective. The top screen is used to display unit information while movement and attacks are determined on the lower screen. Left- and right-handed touch-screen controls and D-pad control schemes are available. One of the special traits is the Flash Drive Gauge, which, when filled, allows a character to use a special attack. Between battles, players can view short sequences featuring the game's mascot, Kopin, and intermission sequences that will allow the player to get to know the characters in the party better. The game also includes a multiplayer battle mode. Special attacks Each time a player character makes an action, his or her Flash Meter will increase. The player can then use Flash Points to perform powerful attacks, called Flash Drives that may also cause status ailments to enemies. Some enemies in Luminous Arc can also use Flash Drives. It is important to note that, while normal attack skills can damage allies and healing skills can restore enemy HP, the effects of Flash Drives committed to their intended targets; for instance, it is impossible for a recovery Flash Drives to heal opponents. Flash Drives can be learned via leveling up, but several are learned as the story progresses. Synergy attacks are a combination attack that can be used when all characters involved have their Flash Points filled up and are close to each other. However, not all characters can perform Synergy attacks, as they are unlocked via story arcs that revolve around certain characters bonding. Intermissions After each battle, the spoils of battle will be displayed on the screen, including gold, items, and Vitae. In addition, the player will be prompted to talk with one of the characters that took part in the battle. An Intermission scene occurs after the ensuing plot dialogue, in which the player can have a short conversation with the previously selected character. On the touch screen, a list of responses will appear with the chosen character's avatar on the top screen. If the choice was favorable, the main character, Alph, will develop a stronger bond with that character, which takes the form of evasion and hit rate bonuses if the two are placed next to each other in future battles. If the character particularly likes the player's response, he or she may give Alph a useful item. However, the player is given a finite number of opportunities to talk to each character, after which it will be impossible to improve the bond. If the player has made good choices throughout the various conversations with a character, there may be a special scene between Alph and that character featuring anime-style art and an additional voice-over. If you say the right thing, you could get an item from the person. As the bond between a character and Alph improve, the heart will continue to grow, and once the heart becomes blue, the character will no longer speak with Alph during Intermission. There are also short cutscenes after every story battle featuring the game's mascot, Kopin. Though he claims that he will try to keep an eye on the characters and tell the story from his point of view, the player actually learns more about Kopin's personality, philosophy, and possible love interests. Vitae Throughout the adventure, the player will obtain magical items called Vitae. According to the game's lore, Vitae obtain their magical properties from the ancient power of Rune, the same power used by the Witches to fuel their magic. In order to make use of a piece of Vitae, it must first be appraised at the workshop in the Witch Village. Once this has been accomplished, the Vitae can be used to add elemental and status effects to weapons. In addition, it is possible to ask other characters about what they know about Vitae. This will allow the player to learn the best combinations for developing items with different strengths. Multiplayer battles Using the Wi-Fi option, players can choose to either battle against an anonymous and random opponent, or against a player whose friend code has been registered. Items are won for each game played against a random opponent, with more being earned if the player is victorious. Players can also play locally via the DS' wireless connection. Plot Luminous Arc takes place in the world of Shtraberl. The land is in a medieval-like era, where the Luminous Church rules over the lands. The Luminous Church which worships their God Zehaal is the only form of government the land has. According to the scriptures known as The Book of Mena of the Luminous Church, thousands of years ago Witches and Dragons fought all across the world to be the superior race. In the process: _The air was stale, the earth barren. The seas raged and the sun vanished. The world fell into darkness._ This disaster was known as Aldheld. The scriptures go on to continue that the saints prayed upon the barren land and eventually the God Zehaal replied to their prayers in beginning the Advent. Zehaal then defeated both the Dragons and Witches and cleansed the world. It was then that Zehaal supposedly blessed the world and named it Shtraberl. Afterwards he endowed the saints with knowledge and went into a deep slumber. The saints then went on to create the Luminous Church. The actual game begins with the Garden Children, a group of people raised as an elite force for the Luminous Church. In the beginning of the game the Garden Children are called to a town to be given their first orders by the Church. They are ordered to hunt for Witches which have been spotted in Canal. As the game progresses, the Garden Children discover that the Witches are not as evil as they had been taught. They then, through the witches discover that the God of the Luminous Church, Zehaal, is trying to resurrect himself to consume the world. After joining forces, the garden Children and the witches fight past members of the Luminous Church as well as vassals of Zehaal. They spend the game fighting against the Luminous Church and their sinister attempts to defeat them. Near the end of the game the group goes through a portal to the world's center to confront Zehaal. They then battle Zehaal and his true form, The Wings Of Doom. After injuring the Wings Of Doom he retreats to lick his wounds, and Lucia the Dawn witch decides to use a powerful yet self-destructive magic to finish him forever. Alph then stays with her to ensure she does not die in the attack, and together they defeat Zehaal once and for all. In the aftermath of the final battle, Canal is restored to a peaceful state. A stable form of government is formed and the Witches are accepted into society as heroes rather than deviants. Development The game was developed by Marvelous Interactive and \\"rookie development studio\\" imageepoch. The game's music was produced, mixed, and mastered by famed sound designer and composer Yasunori Mitsuda. He, along with Akari Kaida, Kazumi Mitome, and Shota Kageyama, composed the music for the game. Reception Luminous Arc received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Honest Gamers said, \\"I realised that it was exactly because Luminous Arc refused to take itself seriously that it was so much fun.\\" However, 1UP.com rated the game as \\"average\\", calling it a \\"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance clone\\" because of its similar gameplay and overall feel. While not impressed with the DS's touch screen capabilities used in the game, the editor wrote that \\"the game's biggest attraction, in theory, is wireless multiplayer, either locally or online\\". GamePro said, \\"It's a decent enough game but it isn't the grand strategy RPG experience that we've all been waiting for.\\" Japanese publication Famitsu gave the game a score of one eight, two sevens, and one six for a total of 28 out of 40. Luminous Arc sold 25,676 copies during its debut week in Japan.

Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld two important aspects of the capital sentencing scheme in Arizona — judicial sentencing and the aggravating factor \\"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" — as not unconstitutionally vague. The Court overruled the first of these holdings in Ring v. Arizona, . The second of these holdings has yet to be overturned. Background On the night of March 2, 1986, Walton and his two codefendants entered a bar in Tucson, Arizona, set on finding someone at random to rob, kidnap, and leave stranded in the desert. The person they chose was Thomas Powell, an off-duty Marine. The three robbed Powell at gunpoint and forced him into his car. Then they drove him out into the desert. While Walton's codefendants sat in the car with the radio turned up, Walton and Powell marched out into the desert. Walton threw Powell down on the ground and shot him once in the head. Walton bragged to his co-defendants that he had \\"never seen a man pee in his pants before.\\" After Walton was arrested a week later, he led the police to Powell's body. The medical examiner revealed that Powell did not die instantly from the gunshot; rather, he had been blinded and rendered unconscious by the gunshot, and only died six days later from dehydration, starvation, and pneumonia. Procedural history A jury convicted Walton of first-degree murder under Arizona's alternate definitions of the crime, either premeditated murder or felony murder. As provided by Arizona law, the trial judge then conducted a sentencing hearing. The State proved two aggravating factors — that the murder was committed in an \\"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner,\\" and that it was committed for pecuniary gain. In mitigation, he argued his relative youth (he was 20) and his diminished capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. The trial judge found both aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mitigating factors were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency, and then imposed a death sentence. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. With respect to the finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, the court observed that under its prior case law, the murder was cruel in light of the evidence that Powell had some uncertainty as to his ultimate fate, and the murder was depraved in light of the evidence that Walton had relished the killing. Reviewing the death sentence independently, it found that the death sentence was appropriate on these facts. While Walton's case was pending on direct appeal, the Ninth Circuit had ruled that Arizona's capital sentencing scheme was unconstitutional. The Court agreed to review Walton's case in order to resolve this split. Jury determination of facts necessary to support the death sentence Walton's first contention before the Court was that \\"every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision must be made by a jury, not by a judge, and that the Arizona scheme would be constitutional only if a jury decides what aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present in a given case and the trial judge then imposes the sentence based on those findings.\\" But the Court had consistently rejected the suggestion that the Constitution required jury sentencing. Aggravating factors were not \\"elements\\" of the crime; as the Court had previously held, they were merely standards to guide the choice between a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment. Moreover, the Constitution does allow a judge to make the findings required by Enmund v. Florida and Tison v. Arizona. The Enmund/Tison finding is not a substantive limit on the definition of a crime, and neither were aggravating factors. Accordingly, the Sixth Amendment did not require a jury to pass on aggravating factors. Justice Scalia concurred in this part of the holding in Walton. It would be another eight years before he would first express his view that every fact necessary to a criminal defendant's punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and six more years after that before that view would become fully articulated as the law of the land. \\"Heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" aggravating factor is not unconstitutionally vague In two earlier decisions, the Court had ruled that aggravating factors imposing the death penalty where the murder was \\"outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman,\\"Godfrey v. Georgia, . or where the murder was \\"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\\"Maynard v. Cartwright, . was unconstitutionally vague. In Walton, however, the Court reversed this trend and upheld Arizona's \\"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" aggravating factor against a similar challenge. Under Gregg v. Georgia and its companion cases, the death penalty was only constitutional because states provided for jury sentencing--or at a very minimum, jury factfinding at sentencing--and appellate review of all death sentences. The Court had to concede that words such as \\"outrageously vile\\" and \\"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\\" were vague without further definition. In the prior decisions where the Court had struck down aggravating factors for vagueness, the jury instructions did not define the terms for the jury, and state supreme court decisions did not define these words any further. These two flaws had led the Court to strike down death sentences predicated on these findings because they posed too great a risk that the death sentences had been imposed arbitrarily or capriciously. But the Arizona system was different in both these areas. First, a jury was not involved in the sentencing phase of a capital case at all — a judge sitting alone presided over the sentencing hearing and made both the preliminary findings of fact and the ultimate decision.NOTE: As a result of the decision in Ring v. Arizona, , Arizona revamped its capital sentencing system. In Arizona, a jury both makes the subsidiary aggravating findings as Ring requires, and imposes the ultimate punishment. Because judges were presumed to follow the law, they needed no guidance in finding a killing to be \\"heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" in the correct circumstances. Second, the Arizona Supreme Court had developed a body of law that defined the words \\"heinous, cruel, or depraved.\\" Thus, there were legal standards available for trial judges to follow in imposing the death sentence. For the Walton Court, these key differences meant that Arizona's \\"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" aggravating factor satisfied the dictates of the Eighth Amendment. Counter-arguments In spite of these developments, Walton contended that the Arizona Supreme Court's definitions had still been arbitrarily applied in his case. The Court recast this argument as a challenge to the proportionality review the Arizona Supreme Court had conducted, and then dismissed it because it deemed proportionality review to be unnecessary in the face of the adequate definition of \\"especially heinous, cruel, and depraved\\" the Arizona Supreme Court had developed. Furthermore, \\"the Arizona Supreme Court plainly undertook its proportionality review in good faith and found that Walton's sentence was proportional to the sentence imposed in cases similar to his.\\" When the Court approved modern capital sentencing systems in 1976, it did so in part because states had undertaken this kind of proportionality review. In Walton, however the Court abandoned any further requirement that the states ensure the death penalty is expressly reserved for the worst of the worst by explicitly comparing the facts of individual cases. Justice Blackmun disagreed with the Court's conclusion that the judge-only sentencing and appellate definition of \\"heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" allowed it to uphold Walton's death sentence. In the Court's view, the state supreme court's definition of the words \\"heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" provided \\"meaningful guidance\\" to trial judges charged with carrying out sentencing hearings and applying the standards the Arizona Supreme Court had propounded. Justice Blackmun pointed out that \\"the State Supreme Court's opinions, however, will serve to narrow [a trial judge's] discretion only if that body of case law articulates a construction of the aggravating circumstance that is coherent and consistent, and that meaningfully limits the range of homicides to which the aggravating factor will apply.\\" In Justice Blackmun's opinion, there was no such definition to be found in Arizona law. In 1977, the Arizona Supreme Court took its first steps toward defining the words \\"heinous, cruel or depraved\\" by turning to dictionary definitions. \\"Heinous\\" meant \\"hatefully or shockingly evil;\\" \\"cruel\\" meant \\"disposed to inflict pain, especially in a wanton, insensate or vindictive manner;\\" and \\"depraved\\" meant \\"marked by debasement, corruption, perversion or deterioration.\\" In other words, the words \\"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" were meant to operate to \\"set the crime apart from the usual or the norm.\\" In 1983, the court expanded this definition. \\"Cruelty\\" focused on the \\"pain and distress visited upon the victim,\\" while \\"heinous\\" and \\"depraved\\" \\"go to the mental state and attitude of the perpetrator as reflected in his words and actions.\\" The majority in Walton reasoned that these cases, along with other decisions applying the definitions to specific crimes, provided \\"meaningful guidance to the sentencer\\" that satisfied the Eighth Amendment's requirement of standardized capital sentencing. Canvassing the Arizona Supreme Court's prior decisions reviewing death sentences on appeal, Blackmun concluded that Arizona's definition of \\"heinous, cruel, or depraved\\" was so broad as to be meaningless. In other words, because there were \\"few first- degree murders which the Arizona Supreme Court would not define as especially heinous or depraved,\\" the aggravating circumstance did not serve its constitutional role of narrowing the class of murderers who were eligible for the death penalty. Under Arizona case law, a murder was \\"heinous\\" if the murderer used more force than necessary to accomplish the killing, but \\"cruel\\" if he used less so that the victim suffers too much before dying. \\"I do not believe that an aggravating factor which requires only that the victim be conscious and aware of his danger for some measurable period before the killing occurs can be said to provide a 'principled way to distinguished this case, in which the death penalty was imposed, from the many cases in which it was not.'\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 497 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court References External links  United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Overruled United States Supreme Court decisions Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and death penalty case law United States Sixth Amendment sentencing case law Capital punishment in Arizona 1990 in United States case law 1990 in Arizona Legal history of Arizona ","title":"Walton v.

The label was most active during the late 1980s and early 1990s and produced primarily salsa, Latin jazz, and merengue music. At its peak, RMM Records employed 55 staff members and had distribution deals in 42 cities around the world, occupying 9,000 square feet in two floors at its Soho headquarters. The label was established by Fania Records promoter Ralph Mercado, who had established RMM Management in 1972 as an artist management and booking agency, providing bookings for Latin artists Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, and Ray Barretto. Artists who recorded for the label included Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Tito Nieves, Oscar D'Leon, Eddie Palmieri, Cheo Feliciano, Ismael Miranda, José Alberto \\"El Canario\\", Tony Vega, Johnny Rivera, Ray Sepúlveda, Domingo Quiñones, Miles Peña, Orquesta Guayacan, Conjunto Clasico, Manny Manuel, the New York Band, Marc Anthony & La India. Record producers included Sergio George, Isidro Infante, and Humberto Ramirez. Empire and legacy RMM filed for bankruptcy in November 2000, selling its assets to Universal Music Group. According to the NY Times, unpaid royalties, as well as a lawsuit settlement of $7.7 million to Glenn Monroig totaling over $11 million, plus interest, contributed to the end of RMM Records. On June 25, 2001, as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy sale, Universal Music Group (UMG) announced the acquisition of RMM’s assets.

In the 1960s, he promoted R & B and soul artists like James Brown and paired them with Latin artists like Mongo Santamaria. In the 1980s-1990s, Mercado was a promoter of Latin Jazz, Latin rock, Merengue and Salsa. He established a network of businesses that promoted concerts, managed artists, and led to the foundation of the record label Ritmo Mundo Musical (RMM). Following the bankruptcy of RMM in 2000, Ralph Mercado returned to artist promotion. * Debra A. Mercado, starting in the early 1990s, was RMM's National Director of Publicity, as well as overseeing international promotions generated by RMM International.

He was prosecuted as one of the Panther 21. He spent six years incarcerated at Leavenworth Penitentiary.Joseph, Jamal, Panther Baby. New York: Algonquin Books, 2012. Early life and Black Panthers Born Edward L. Joseph in Havana, Cuba, Jamal Joseph was raised in New York City where he joined the ranks of the Black Panther Party in September 1968 at the age of 15. The Assassination of Martin Luther King had occurred that same year, leaving Joseph feeling outraged. He sought out the Panthers believing them to be the most militant Black group around. However, when he asked his local branch to arm him, instead of receiving a gun as he expected, the local chapter gave him a stack of books by African-American authors instead. He was informed that is how he would be \\"armed\\". Legal experiences In 1969, Joseph was one of the defendants in the Panther 21 trial, which accused the Panthers of planning a series of deadly attacks across New York City. Joseph spent a year in prison pending the verdict before it was deemed he, as well as all other defendants, were ultimately not guilty. During Joseph's time in the Black Panther Party, he befriended Afeni Shakur, who was later one of his fellow defendants in the Panther 21 trial, and would act as Godfather to her son Tupac Shakur. In 1981, he was convicted for harboring a fugitive, Mutulu Shakur (Afeni's husband), who had taken part in the robbery of a Brink’s armored car in Rockland County, New York as part of an operation by members of the Black Liberation Army and the Weather Underground.

It is composed of repeating 20–30 amino acid stretches that are unusually rich in the hydrophobic amino acid leucine. These tandem repeats commonly fold together to form a solenoid protein domain, termed leucine-rich repeat domain. Typically, each repeat unit has beta strand-turn-alpha helix structure, and the assembled domain, composed of many such repeats, has a horseshoe shape with an interior parallel beta sheet and an exterior array of helices. One face of the beta sheet and one side of the helix array are exposed to solvent and are therefore dominated by hydrophilic residues. The region between the helices and sheets is the protein's hydrophobic core and is tightly sterically packed with leucine residues. Leucine-rich repeats are frequently involved in the formation of protein–protein interactions. Examples Leucine-rich repeat motifs have been identified in a large number of functionally unrelated proteins. The best-known example is the ribonuclease inhibitor, but other proteins such as the tropomyosin regulator tropomodulin and the toll-like receptor also share the motif. In fact, the toll-like receptor possesses 10 successive LRR motifs which serve to bind pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns. Although the canonical LRR protein contains approximately one helix for every beta strand, variants that form beta-alpha superhelix folds sometimes have long loops rather than helices linking successive beta strands. One leucine-rich repeat variant domain (LRV) has a novel repetitive structural motif consisting of alternating alpha- and 310-helices arranged in a right-handed superhelix, with the absence of the beta-sheets present in other leucine-rich repeats. Associated domains Leucine-rich repeats are often flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine- rich domains, but not always as is the case with C5orf36 They also co-occur with LRR adjacent domains. These are small, all beta strand domains, which have been structurally described for the protein Internalin (InlA) and related proteins InlB, InlE, InlH from the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Their function appears to be mainly structural: They are fused to the C-terminal end of leucine-rich repeats, significantly stabilising the LRR, and forming a common rigid entity with the LRR. They are themselves not involved in protein-protein-interactions but help to present the adjacent LRR- domain for this purpose. These domains belong to the family of Ig-like domains in that they consist of two sandwiched beta sheets that follow the classical connectivity of Ig-domains. The beta strands in one of the sheets is, however, much smaller than in most standard Ig-like domains, making it somewhat of an outlier. An iron sulphur cluster is found at the N-terminus of some proteins containing the leucine-rich repeat variant domain (LRV). These proteins have a two-domain structure, composed of a small N-terminal domain containing a cluster of four Cysteine residues that houses the 4Fe:4S cluster, and a larger C-terminal domain containing the LRV repeats. Biochemical studies revealed that the 4Fe:4S cluster is sensitive to oxygen, but does not appear to have reversible redox activity.

His work includes novels, short stories, non-fiction (including histories of food and of homosexuality), cookery books, stage and television plays, paintings and drawings, book and magazine illustrations. He has written and presented a television documentary on vandalism, appeared in numerous radio and television programmes and lectured on food history, literature and social issues. For fourteen years he wrote a regular food column for The Guardian.  Early and personal life  Colin Spencer was born in 1933 in Thornton Heath, London, and was largely brought up in the south of England. From an early age he knew that he wanted to paint and write. He attended Brighton Grammar School and went on to study at Brighton Art College, but he feels now that he is wholly self-educated. His colourful family provided his youthful imagination with rich material for his later novels, as did his passionate emotional involvements with both men and women. He spent his period of National Service as a pacifist in the Royal Army Medical Corps in war-ravaged Hamburg. He has subsequently lived in London, Vienna, Athens and on the Greek island of Lesbos. His first novel was published when he was 28. His portrait of E.M. Forster was painted when he was 29. He has twice been married and has one son and two grandsons. He has never stopped painting and writing, and now lives in East Sussex where he is writing the second volume of his autobiography, staring with delight at the Seven Sisters, gardening, and producing the paintings he feels he has striven to create throughout his life – recently described in The Financial Times How to Spend It magazine as \\"muscular, powerfully envisaged oils\\", the work of \\"a remarkable Indian summer\\".Paul Richardson, The Reconnoisseur column, How To Spend It magazine, Financial Times, 1 November 2011 The first volume of his planned 3-part autobiography has recently been published (Quartet Books, April 2013). Backing into Light: My Father's Son tells the story of the first 3 decades of his eventful life through his wartime boyhood dominated by his raucous, womanising and irrepressible father, to his first successes in the 50s and 60s as an artist, novelist and playwright. They were years which saw ardent affairs with both women and men, a stormy marriage, the birth of a son, and a traumatic divorce. The book has been described as “full of clear-eyed observation and thoughtful reflection, as well as comic incident … unflinchingly honest and exuberantly entertaining,”review by Sebastian Wayneflete, Fitzrovia News, Issue 129 Summer 2013 while The Spectator finds it “a remarkable autobiography which subverts everything you thought you knew about love and life.” review by Duncan Fallowell, The Spectator, 22 June 2013  Fiction  Since 1955 Colin Spencer has had nine novels as well as numerous short stories published both in the UK and abroad. His work can be divided into the 4 semi-autobiographical works of the Generation sequence; the two satirical black comedies Poppy, Mandragora and the New Sex, and How the Greeks Kidnapped Mrs Nixon (republished in paperback under the title Cock-Up); the sexual realist drama Panic, a compassionate examination of the mentality of a child murderer; the experimental Asylum, merging the myths of Oedipus and the Old Testament Fall of Man into a narrative written in a style akin to poetic prose; and his first novel, set mostly in Vienna, An Absurd Affair, which he feels can be sensibly ignored. That first novel was followed in 1963 by Anarchists in Love the first book of his four-volume novel sequence GENERATION which the author describes as the main core of his work, and “fictionalised autobiography.” Further volumes in the series The Tyranny of Love, Lovers in War and The Victims of Love appeared in 1967, 1969 and 1978. With a Dickensian breadth of characters and social settings, the four volumes follow the saga of the Simpson family from the end of World War I through to the 1960s age of sexual and social experimentation. It focuses in particular on the tortuous search for self-realisation and love by Sundy and Matthew, the two artistically gifted children of the raucously womanising Eddy. The sequence was described by Sir Huw Wheldon as a \\"work of serious purpose; affecting, hilarious and grave. It is a tapestry of unforgettable characters in all their seaminess and sadness, their idealism and desires.\\"from the book-jacket of Victims in Love – an appreciation provided to the publishers, Quartet Books, by Sir Huw  Theatre  Seven of Colin Spencer's plays have been performed since the first production in December 1966 at the Hampstead Theatre Club of The Ballad of The False Barman. It was directed by Robin Phillips and featured Caroline Blakiston, Penelope Keith and Michael Pennington. The play is a musical fantasy set in a beach bar run by a bald-headed lesbian \\"barman\\" and peopled by whores of various sexes and their clientele, including a transvestite thieving vicar. His next play to be performed, Spitting Image, also first appeared at Hampstead in October 1968 before moving to The Duke of York's in the West End. The production was directed by James Roose-Evans and starred Derek Fowlds, Frank Middlemass and Lally Bowers. Further productions followed in 1969 off Broadway in New York, in Arnhem, The Netherlands, in Vienna and in Australia. The play concerns a homosexual couple who discover that they are expecting a baby, and society's reaction to this unconventional conception. John Russell Taylor in his book, The Second Wave: British Drama of the Sixties, remarks “for all the play’s cheery light fantastic [it] contains altogether more truth than is quite comfortable.\\"John Russell Taylor, The Second Wave: British Drama of the Sixties, 1978, Methuen; (1st ed. reprinted, paperback), . , p 210. The play was revived in a performance at the Hampstead Theatre in 2009 as part of the celebrations of the theatre’s 50th anniversary. Three comedies: The Trial of St George, a satire on British justice when dealing with sexuality, inspired by the Oz Trial; Why Mrs Neustadter Always Loses, a wry monologue by an American divorcee exiled on a Greek island; and Keep It in the Family, a satire concerning a happy incestuous family (which Colin Spencer also directed) appeared between 1972 and 1978 at the Soho Poly. Interest in his work abroad led to performances of his play The Sphinx Mother, a modern Oedipus, at the Salzburg Festival in 1972, and Lilith, a comedy of surrealist images, at the Schauspielhaus, Vienna in 1979.  Non-fiction  Colin Spencer's first published non-fiction book (written with Chris Barlas), which appeared in 1984, was a treatise on farting, Reports from Behind, illustrated by Spencer cartoons. His moving account of his affair with the Australian theatre director, John Tasker, Which of Us Two?, was first published by Viking in 1990, and then in a paperback edition by Penguin in 1991. The Faber Book of Food, an anthology, collected and written with Claire Clifton, was published by Faber & Faber in 1994. His interest in sexuality and social attitudes towards it led to the publication of Homosexuality – a History in 1995, and The Gay Kama Sutra in the following year. His scholarly interest in food culture and history led to the publication of The Heretic's Feast – a History of Vegetarianism in 1993 (also published in the US in 1995, and winning a special mention in the Premio Langhe Ceretto prize of Italy), the award-winning British Food – an Extraordinary Thousand Years of History in 2002, and his recently published book From Microliths to Microwaves – The Evolution of British Agriculture, Food and Cooking, an account of the long history of farming, food and cookery in Britain and how our national cuisine was forged.  Cookery books  From early on Colin Spencer's creative instincts were applied to food and cookery, and in 1978 his book Gourmet Cooking for Vegetarians was published. That was followed through the 80s and 90s by a series of other cookery books, totalling 18 in all. For fourteen years he wrote a regular food column for the Guardian. His column was particularly concerned with exploring current issues and anxieties about food production and manufacture. In 2001 he was described by Germaine Greer as 'the greatest living food writer'.In her column in The Telegraph 30 June 2001. He has received many awards for his food writing, including the Guild of Food Writers Michael Smith Award, the André Simon Memorial Fund Special Award, the Gourmand World Cookbook Award for the Best Culinary History Book in the World, and the Glenfiddich Cookery Writer of the Year Award.  Visual arts  During his twenties numerous of Colin Spencer's drawings were published in The London Magazine, The Transatlantic Review and Encounter. A series of drawings of writers of our time was published in The Times Literary Supplement in 1959. Those he portrayed included John Betjeman, E.M. Forster, C.P.Snow and his wife Pamela Hansford Johnson, Graham Greene, Alan Ross, Iris Murdoch, Angus Wilson, Evelyn Waugh, John Lehmann, Stevie Smith, V.S.Naipaul, and John Osborne, among others. An oil portrait of E.M. Forster hung for many years in his rooms at King's College Cambridge. On his death Forster left it to Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears and it is now in the Britten-Pears Library in Aldeburgh. Colin Spencer painting: Travelling Player 2011 Colin Spencer had huge fun working alongside Katharine Whitehorn to illustrate her column in the national Sunday newspaper, The Observer, with satirical drawings delineating the public's interpretation of fashion trends. He was commissioned by the Royal Opera House to draw their idiosyncratic opera audience for their member's Magazine. He has completed oil portraits for a wide range of private customers and collectors, including Carl Winter, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; Lady Rawlinson; Diana Hopkinson; Michael Davidson; and Canon Frederic Hood of Pusey House, Oxford. His work resides in a wide range of private collections amongst those of Melvyn Bragg, Germaine Greer, Derek Grainger, Bob Swash, Diana Athill, Prue Leith and the late Mary Renault and Sir Huw Wheldon. His artistic work since has ranged from landscape drawings of Winchelsea Beach and Rye countryside to oil portraits of the poet Harry Fainlight and has lately been exhibited in London, Rye and Brighton. A recent series of paintings entitled The Downs reflected the sensuous forms of the landscape of the South Downs where he lives. He is currently intensely involved in creating paintings which he describes as \\"images of the unknown, paths through conflict, compounds of sex and spirit, mysterious reflections, hints and fading memories which unsettle the darkness.\\" The themes of his present paintings are: War, Music, and Sex, the interior life of flowers, the sea bed and how do hills form roots.  Other activities  Colin Spencer has been Co-Chairman (1982), Chairman (1988–90) and Vice-President (1990–99) of The Writers Guild of Great Britain and President of the Guild of Food Writers (1994–99). He continues as a judge for the J R Ackerley Prize for Autobiography.  Works   Fiction  An Absurd Affair, 1961, Longmans Green. 1970, Panther Books, (paperback), , .

Harvesting The peas are spherical when harvested, with an outer skin. The peas are dried and the dull-coloured outer skin of the pea removed, then split in half by hand or by machine at the natural split in the seed's cotyledon. There are green and yellow varieties of split pea. Gregor Mendel studied the inheritance of seed colour in peas; the green phenotype is recessive to the yellow one. Traditionally, the genotype of purebred yellow is \\"YY\\" and that of green is \\"yy\\", and hybrids of the two, \\"Yy\\", have a yellow (dominant) phenotype. Split peas are high in protein and low in fat, with one gram of fat per serving. Most of the calories come from protein and complex carbohydrates. The split pea is known to be a natural food source that contains some of the highest amounts of dietary fibre, containing 26 grams of fibre per 100 gram portion (104% DV based on a diet). The Indian toor dal (split pigeon peas) and chana dal (split yellow gram, desi chickpeas) are commonly also referred to as peas, although from other legume species than Pisum sativum.  Uses  Culinary A sack of split peas Green and yellow split peas are commonly used to make pea soup or \\"split pea soup\\", and sometimes pease pudding, which was commonly prepared in medieval Europe. Yellow split pea is known as Lappeh in western Asia and particularly in Iran. It is the main ingredient of the Iranian food khoresh gheymeh, which is served on the side of white rice in Iranian cuisine. It is also an important ingredient in the famous Tabriz köftesii, a kofta speciality from northern Iran. In north India, they are generally known as matar ki daal, sometimes used as a cheaper variation for the very popular chhole on stalls offering it. Yellow split peas are most often used to prepare dal in Guyana, Suriname, Mauritius, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Fiji. Referred to as simply dal, it is prepared similarly to dals found in India, but also may be used in a variety of other recipes. Yellow split peas are used to make a sweet snack in Beijing cuisine. Wandouhuang (豌豆黄) is a sweetened and chilled pease pudding, sometimes flavored with osmanthus blossoms and dates. In Europe, the Greek \\"fáva\\" is a dish made with yellow split peas pureed to create an appetizer or meze. Furthermore, in the winter the Dutch serve a dish called erwtensoep which is primarily made from green split peas. In the Caribbean split peas are a key ingredient in many Indian dishes. Moroccan Berber cuisine has “tamaraqt” or yellow split pea soup with olive oil and cumin added. Salt, garlic and onion can be added to taste. It is eaten with bread.

It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1977. Creative origins In his biography of Kingsley Amis, Richard Bradford devotes a chapter to The Alteration, its origins and context within the author's life. In 1973, Amis had heard a reproduction of the voice of Alessandro Moreschi, the last known European castrato. Amis disagreed with the proposition that Moreschi's performance could be considered \\"great art\\", because Moreschi had been castrated, and \\"true\\" art centred on the celebration of human sexuality. Bradford argues that this was a matter of considerable importance for Amis himself, as he may have been suffering from impotence or sexual dysfunction in his marriage, due to advancing age. Thus, he took exception to Roman Catholic teaching, based as it was in a magisterium of celibate men. Plot introduction The main character, ten-year-old Hubert Anvil, is a chorister at St George's Basilica, Coverley (real world Cowley), for whom tragedy beckons when his teachers and the Church hierarchy, all the way up to the Pope himself, decree that the boy's superb voice is too precious to sacrifice to puberty. Despite his own misgivings, he must undergo castration, one of the two alterations of the title. Insight into this world is offered during Anvil's abortive escape from church authorities, with references to alternative world versions of known political and cultural figures. Hubert's mother carries on an illicit affair with the family chaplain, and his brother, Anthony, is a liberal dissident from repressive church policies. In this timeline, there are two pivotal divergences from known history. Arthur Tudor and Catherine of Aragon's short- lived union produced a son, Stephen II of England. When Henry of York (\\"the Abominable\\") tried to usurp his nephew's throne, there was a papal crusade (the \\"War of the English Succession\\") to restore the rightful heir, culminating in the \\"Holy Victory\\" at Coverley, which was designated as the ecclesiastical capital of England. Secondly, the Protestant Reformation did not take place as Martin Luther was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became Pope Germanian I. Luther's anti-Semitism may have infected this history to a greater extent during his papacy, as the novel discloses that Jews are forced to seclude themselves and wear yellow stars to advertise their religious and ethnic identity. In this history, Thomas More did not marry, and ascended to the Papacy as Pope Hadrian VII. While the Papacy still holds sway across Western Europe, in this version of the twentieth century Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of New England, which includes such locations as Cranmeria (named after Thomas Cranmer), Hussville (named for Jan Huss), Waldensia (Waldensians) and Wyclif City (John Wycliffe). The head of the schismatic church in New England is the Archpresbyter of Arnoldstown (named after Benedict Arnold). Joseph Rudyard Kipling held office as \\"First Citizen\\" from 1914–1918, while Edgar Allan Poe was an acclaimed general who died at the moment of his victory over the combined forces of Louisiana and Mexico in the war of 1848–1850. We learn towards the end of the book that this Protestant state also has unpleasant features, such as practising apartheid towards Native Americans and a harsh penal system. England dominates the British Isles with Ireland being called \\"West-England\\" and Scotland being annexed to England as \\"North-England\\". Instead of parliamentary democracy, the English Isles are administered by a Convocation of clergy accountable to the Catholic hierarchy. The rule of the Church is absolute and totalitarian, controlled by the Holy Office, a sort of KGB or Gestapo equivalent. (Monsignors Henricus and Laurentius – Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria – are mentioned in passing.) The state of the world is illustrated in a description of national, clerical and royal figures at the funeral of Stephen III, late King of England, which opens the book. There is reference to the Kings of Portugal, Sweden, Naples and Lithuania, which suggests that no Italian nation-state exists in this history due to the temporal strength of the Papacy. The Crown Prince of Muscovy is also mentioned, suggesting that Tsarism holds sway, and the Dauphin leads one to conclude that the French monarchy is also still in existence. Germany is a nation-state, known as Almaigne and ruled by an Emperor, although it may not have exactly the same national boundaries. The \\"Vicar General\\" of the \\"Emperor Patriarch\\" of Candia suggests that the Greek Orthodox Church survives as a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, albeit exiled from its native Greece (which is still under Ottoman domination) and with its headquarters in Crete. Finally, this opening section cites the \\"Viceroys\\" of India, Brazil and New Spain, suggesting that colonialism and direct imperialism are still realities here. A Christian/Muslim cold war exists between the Papacy and the Ottoman Empire. Described as a war against an opponent that can never be destroyed and which can be held in check only by maintaining permanent armies and fleets, it serves the useful purpose of distracting any tendency to rebel or question. Pope John XXIV is a Machiavellian Yorkshireman, who allows the cold war to heat up as a Malthusian plot to resolve Europe's population growth – the church has access to bacteriological warfare as an alternative to birth control, whose prior papal prohibition John XXIV opposes. The book's coda, set in 1991, fifteen years after the events of the main body of the book, reveals that events have turned out as the Pope planned. Europe's surplus population has become cannon fodder for the war, which ended in a narrow victory, despite mention that the Ottoman Empire got as far as Brussels. However, one of Hubert's childhood friends, Decuman, is mentioned as being among the occupation troops in Adrianople in far western Turkey, suggesting that the Ottomans either lost the war, or at least were forced to make significant territorial concessions to the Catholic West. William Shakespeare's work was suppressed in this history, although Thomas Kyd's original text of Hamlet has survived, and is still performed in 1976 (albeit only in New England). Shelley lived until 1853, at which point he set fire to Castel Gandolfo outside Rome and perished. By contrast, Mozart, Beethoven, Blake, Hockney and Holman Hunt have allowed their talents to submit to religious authority. Edward Bradford argues that the choice of authors and musicians here is not meant to imply Amis's own preferences, but questions the value of art subordinated to a destructive ideology that represses sexual freedom and human choice. Underscoring the clerical domination of this world, Hubert's small collection of books includes a set of Father Bond novels (an amalgam of Father Brown and James Bond), as well as Lord of the Chalices (The Lord of the Rings), Saint Lemuel's Travels (Gulliver's Travels), and The Wind in the Cloisters (Wind in the Willows). There is also reference to a Monsignor Jean-Paul Sartre of the Jesuits, and A. J. Ayer (who was in real life a noted atheist) is Professor of Dogmatic Theology at New College, Oxford. \\"Science\\" is literally a dirty word, and while \\"invention\\" is not, the scope of inventors is severely limited. Electricity has been banned; the only form of internal combustion engine permitted is the Diesel, which works without a spark. Some of the incidental pleasure of the book is in the \\"alternative technology\\" reminiscent of Amis's friend and fellow-author Harry Harrison, such as the high-speed train that takes characters from London to Rome in just seven hours, via Thomas Sopwith's Channel Bridge. Airships feature as a mode of transportation connecting Europe with Africa and North America, with heavier-than-air vehicles being exclusive to New England. Allusion to known historical figures include the political scene in Britain in the 1970s, and may reflect Amis's increasingly conservative attitudes. For example, Lord Stansgate (Tony Benn) presides over the Holy Office, and Officers Paul Foot and Corin Redgrave are two of its feared operatives. Pope John XXIV is a thinly disguised Harold Wilson and his Secretary of State is Enrico Berlinguer. Other references are more obscure; opera-lovers with a good knowledge of Latin will, however, be able to identify the two castrati from the Vatican, Federicus Mirabilis and Lupigradus Viaventosa, as the German singers Fritz Wunderlich and Wolfgang Windgassen, both recently deceased when Amis was writing. Alternative parallel-world novels in The Alteration Just as The Man in the High Castle features a book titled The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, depicting a world (but not our own) in which the Axis powers lost World War II, so The Alteration refers to an alternate history book by one Philip K. Dick entitled The Man in the High Castle. This book-within-a-book depicts a world in which Stephen II was never born, so the \\"Holy Victory\\" never happened, and Henry VIII became king legitimately. As in reality, Henry married Catherine of Aragon, but their son Henry, Duke of Cornwall survived infancy, becoming Henry IX in 1547. Martin Luther became \\"schismatic\\" in this world, as he did in reality, and a \\"Union\\" of former English North American colonies breaks away in 1848 instead of 1776, conquering most of North America. The same book also features the publication of The Origin of Species, the widespread application of electricity including in aviation and Beethoven's composing of twenty symphonies before his death in 1835. Galliard, an alternative-universe counterpart to Keith Roberts's Pavane, is also mentioned in this tribute to the subgenre. (The Galliard and the Pavane were both forms of Renaissance dance.)

After following trails of the engine oil, police found the BMW at 50 Golf Links, the residence of Rajeev Gupta. It was then revealed that Sanjeev Nanda, grandson of Indian Navy Chief and son of Indian arms dealer Suresh Nanda was driving the car after returning from a party with Siddhartha Gupta (son of Rajeev Gupta), and Manik Kapoor. While Nanda and several related parties were initially acquitted and released in a trial in 1999, he was later found guilty in 2008 and sentenced to two years in prison, which was reduced to time served, a large fine, and two years of community service by the Indian Supreme Court in 2012. The case attracted media attention, and was viewed by India Today as \\"a test of the judicial system's ability to take on the powerful\\".indiatoday.digitaltoday.in  Hit- and-run case  In the early morning of 10 January 1999, Sanjeev Nanda was returning from a late night party in Gurgaon with some friends. Nanda had reportedly been instructed by his parents not to drive that night, but was driving anyway. There was a police checkpoint on Lodhi Road and it appears that the constable may have challenged the car, though it is also possible that the car was going so fast that it was out of control. Sanjeev's BMW crashed through all the people at the police checkpoint, immediately killing two constables and two others. Another policeman and another bystander died later in hospital. The seventh victim survived. After running through the policemen, he allegedly stopped the car to check the damage, saw people under the car, and according to the prosecution, at this point a co-passenger said: \\"Let’s go,\\" and they quickly drove away. The car was then driven to a house in Golf Links, New Delhi, where a watchman and driver were instructed to clean the bumpers and bonnet of the car. Subsequently, the police charged these three with destroying evidence. A few days later, a witness came forward to describe the scene. At the time of the crash, he was on his way to the railway station. NDTV sting operation NDTV carried out a sting operation in which defence attorneys were filmed offering money to a witness. Later the Delhi High Court debarred the advocates for four months.Sanjeev Nanda’s friend acquitted Investigation The vehicle's broken registration plate was found on the scene the next morning. Preliminary investigations revealed that the car would have been going at 140 km/h when it hit the victims. Within a few hours of the incident, Inspector Jagdish Pandey of the Police Control Room of Delhi Police traced the car by trailing the oil leak to the grade from the spot of the accident. They found the one-month-old car, purchased in his sister Sonali Nanda's name, with foreign number plates, which had not been registered in India. Attempts to clean it were still in progress. Nanda and his friends were arrested, but his clothes, and those of the others who helped clean the car, were never found. Nanda and his friends were charged with culpable homicide in court. Re-trial The case went up for re-trial and was tried on a fast-track basis. On 2 September 2008, Nanda was convicted by a Delhi court for killing six persons. On 3 August 2012 the Supreme Court reduced his prison sentence to the two years he had already spent in prison, but the court added a large fine, and sentenced Nanda to do community service for two years.

Biography Reilly was born (as Pauline Duncan) in Adelaide. Her family moved to Melbourne where she attended Korowa Anglican Girls' School and Melbourne Girls Grammar School until 1934. Before the Second World War she worked as a secretary, then served from 1942 to 1944 as a gunner in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, as well as working for Australian Army Intelligence. She married Arthur Reilly in 1943. Reilly joined the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1956, which she served as Publicity Officer 1966–1967, on the Field Investigations Committee 1969–1972, as President 1972–1975, and as the Chair of the Atlas Committee 1976–1982. From 1969 to 1970 she was President of the Bird Banders' Association of Australia. From 1964 to 1981 she was the Honorary Regional Victorian Organiser of the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme. One of her main achievements with the RAOU was the instigation, leadership and successful conclusion of the RAOU's first Atlas of Australian Birds project, fieldwork for which ran from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1981. Reilly was actively involved in ornithological fieldwork for many years, especially in studies of little penguins. In 1968 she founded the Penguin Study Group of the Victorian Ornithological Research Group. In 1973 she led an expedition to the Great Australian Bight to carry out penguin research. In 1978–79 she became the first woman to spend the summer research season on subantarctic Macquarie Island to band penguins. She was invited to open the Second International Penguin Conference in August 1992. In later years Reilly moved to Aireys Inlet on the Victorian coast where she concentrated on writing a series of scientifically accurate children's books about Australian birds and other animals, mainly illustrated first by Will Rolland and later by Kaylene Traynor. Reilly died on the 22 April 2011, aged 92.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average – across all demographics.\\" As of 2015, it had a total semestral enrollment of 1,716. These students are primarily from Mindanao, although there are quite a number from Luzon and the Visayas. International enrollment from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America comprises about five percent of the total student population. History MVC was founded by Andrew Nathaniel Nelson primarily in response to the growing interest in Christian education within the Philippines. A 584% increase for a six-year period in the college enrollment of Philippine Union College when he was then president, magnified the problems associated with the less-than-ideal location of the campus, leading him to the formulation of a nine-point criteria for the location of an Adventist college. It was founded on Adventist principles and prior experience (involvement in the founding of Seattle Junior Academy in 1915 and the relocation of Japan Missionary College in 1926). Although Nelson's criteria was perceived as too idealistic by some of his colleagues, he was determined to find such a site. His search focused on the island of Mindanao, since part of the criteria involved the incidence of typhoons, which was a rare occurrence in that island. The campus of Mindanao Mission Academy, situated in Manticao, Misamis Oriental, served as MVC's temporary campus from 1949 to 1952, while the search was on for a site that met the criteria. It was then known as Philippine Union Junior College. Nelson and his team arrived at MVC's current site in 1950. Negotiations for the purchase of property were then started. After the purchase, initial structures were set up. In 1952, the name \\"Mountain View College\\" was chosen from a list that included \\"Philippine Missionary College\\" and \\"Oriental Missionary College\\". In 1953, classes officially started at the new location. MVC's first offerings were certificates or associate degrees in business, education, and religion. It held its first graduation exercises in 1957. As of 2009, the college has 132 full-time and part-time teaching faculty members and 73 staff members in the industrial and support service departments. Gentilic The Gentilic \\"MVCian\\" has been used for many years by MVC alumni. Students only use it when they are off-campus. Its use is more informal than official. Campuses Mountain View College main campus The main campus is located on a plateau in Mt. Nebo, Valencia City, with an area of 10.24 km², which includes farmlands, forests, and ranch lands ideal for industry work. The land has an ample supply of water that allows MVC to have its own hydroelectric plants, providing the campus populace with enough electricity along with an abundant water supply for the homes and other college facilities. It is situated between the Kitanglad and Kalatungan mountain ranges and bordered on the north by the Manupali River and on the south by the Anasag and Malingon creeks. An annex campus is located in Bagontaas, Valencia City, which is occupied by the School of Nursing. It includes a solarium, dormitories, classrooms, offices, and a cafeteria. Villages The faculty homes within the main campus are clustered into villages. These villages are often referred to as barangays, although not in the same sense as barangay, the smallest political administrative division used by the national government. Some village names are derived from the road or drive passing through it. The residence buildings originally sported the ubiquitous white coloring with green trimmings. On the southwest corner of the campus is Malingon Drive. Prior to that, it was called Jamandre Drive, which was once split into two: Jamandre Village (in the northern end) and Bougainvilla Beauty (in the southern end). On the western edge of the campus is Ranch Drive, although the road is named M.O. Abesta Avenue. On the northwest corner is Pioneers' Drive, which used to be Loggers' Village. Between Ranch Drive and Pioneers' Drive is a scatter of homes collectively known as Engineering Drive. On the southern edge is Barangay Uno, which was also called Elementary Drive and Section Two. Part of Barangay Uno is the Korean Village, where most houses were once occupied by Korean students. On the eastern-southeastern corner is Pines Drive, which used to be Section One, or the American Homes, where American missionaries were housed during the early years of MVC. Guesthouses There are currently four guesthouses on campus: the Jubilee Guesthouse, which is adjacent to the Jubilee Park; the Pioneer Guesthouse, which is adjacent to the Hilltop Minimart; The Pallasa Hall, located also in the Jubilee Park and occasionally used for the practicum of TLE students; and the Alumni Church Guesthouse, located behind the church building. Student life The student body of MVC is represented by the Central Student Council which elects its officers every school year. Each of the seven schools has its own local council which elects its officers every semester. About 80% of the students are housed in two ladies' dormitories, two men's dormitories and a married-student dormitory. The rest either stay with the faculty or commute from the nearby sitios, barangays, or municipalities. A typical student's extra-curricular time is spent in the group activities of the organizations that the student belongs to. Given the country setting of MVC, the most common activities are camping and outreach. Smaller-sized organizations tend to have a more close-knit group of members. On the other hand, relationships between members and non-members vary from simple face- recognition to the intimate, as inter-group dating is frowned upon. Student organizations MVC is home to a number of student organizations. Included here are the current and defunct organizations: The political organizations include: Central Student Council, School of Agriculture Student Council, School of Arts and Sciences Student Council, School of Business and Accountancy Student Council, School of Computing Student Council, School of Education Student Council, School of Nursing Student Council, and School of Theology Student Council. Inter-school organizations include: ANAK, OP, and PE. Academic organizations include: Circle of English Majors, Lambda Sigma, Mu Sigma Kappa, Society of Agricultural Majors, Society of Electrical Technologists, Teachers of Tomorrow – Ethyl Young Chapter, Teachers of Tomorrow – Urbano Oliva Chapter, Young Ellen's Club, Young Theologians Club. The singing groups include the: Advent Philomels, Alauda Arvensis,Hilltop Chorale, Singing Ambassadors, Sons and Daughters, Thrushes Ministrants, Goldenaires. There are also other musical groups, such as: Hilltop Symphonic Band and His Instruments. Cultural organizations include: Adventist Muslim Relations, International Students Association, area specific organizations, such as: Association of DAvao Mission Students (ADAMS); and the alumni organizations of the Adventist academies in Mindanao and the Visayas. Service, outreach, and ministerial organizations include: Hilltop Amateur Radio Team (HART), LIGHT, Master Guides, Ministerial Seminar, Peer Counselors, Regeneration, Rescue 741, Seekers for Truth, Student Association of Literature Evangelists (SALE), and SULADS. Miscellaneous organizations are: EARTH Society, Advent Explorers, and the Reach-out Gymnaires. Fraternities and sororities are not allowed on campus. Student media Also featured at MVC are a number of student publications, both current and defunct: BEAMS, Dots and Dashes, Hilltop Flashes, Hilltop Slashes, Non-Linear Points, The Orchid, Outreach, Newsprint, Pencil, The Sentry, and The Views. Students also man the campus AM station, DXCR. In-campus accessibility The different buildings within the campus are within walking distance from each other. They are often connected with covered concrete walkways. Prior to the fire of 1991 that damaged the administration building and some classrooms, elevated wooden ramps connected the main buildings. Vehicular access is also provided either through graveled or concreted, one-lane or two-lane roads. Access to more distant locations are usually via dirt roads that are only occasionally graveled. Off-campus accessibility The main campus is accessible by public utility jeeps that travel to and from Valencia City. A concreted two-lane road links the campus to the national highway, which is about away. Students residing in the dormitories have limited off-campus access. Only commuting students compose the bulk of passengers traveling to and from the campus on a daily basis. Connectivity A fiber-optic backbone links the main buildings and offices. Some locations on the main campus also provide free public wifi. Students pay a one-time fee and have unlimited access throughout the entire semester. However, some students still opt to access the internet through any of the locally available service providers due to speed and filtering issues. Despite having two hydroelectric plants, the power supply remains unstable at times, making uninterruptible internet access impossible. Sports and recreation The main campus includes a football field, which is also utilized for track and field events, one outdoor tennis court, three outdoor basketball courts, one outdoor volleyball court, a softball field, two swimming pools, and an auditorium, for indoor sports activities. The roads, paths, and walkways crisscrossing the entire campus make it conducive for jogging, brisk walking, or running. The Manupali River, north of the campus, and the Malingon River, south of the campus, where the Malingon Falls is also located, have some locations suitable for white water rafting. The rock cliffs bordering the Manupali River may provide some possible venue for rock climbing. The Nelson Hill, east of the campus, and the Telescope Hill, west of the campus, and the generally varied topographical terrain surrounding the campus also makes it suitable for hiking and horseback riding. Being a bird sanctuary makes it also appropriate for bird watching. A number of locations suitable for camping dot the area in and around the campus: multiple spots along the Manupali; a clearing adjacent to the Malingon Falls; a reforested area known as the Millennium Park; the grounds of the elementary school; a forested area known as Sleepy Hollow; the reservoir grounds; and many others. Located within a few kilometers of Mount Musuan, an active volcano, Mount Kalatungan, a potentially-active volcano, and Mount Kitanglad, an inactive volcano, the campus has many students who count mountaineering as among their hobbies. Given the number of waterfalls located close to the campus, falls- hopping is also considered a recreational activity. The Malingon Falls and the Twin Falls are both located within the MVC property. The neighboring barangay of Lilingayon to the west of the campus also has its Alamay Falls and Kimatahay Falls. Outreach Most students are active in religious, livelihood, and health outreach to the neighboring sitios and barangays. These locations are often accessible via mountain trails, and sometimes require wading waist-deep across icy-cold creeks and rivers.

The museum contains both an open-air museum open seasonly, and an indoor building open year-round. Opened in 1967 and expanded significantly since then, it is a major tourist attraction in the area. Approximately 47,000 visitors visit the museum each year. The village features original Mennonite housebarns, churches, and other buildings, some of which date back to the 1800s. The indoor facility documents the history of Mennonites from their origins in the Netherlands and Switzerland and focuses on the Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites who came to Western Canada. Temporary exhibits, also open year-round, are held in the Gerhard Enns Gallery. The museum is famous for its Dutch windmill, a replica of the original windmill built in Steinbach in the 1880s. The first replica was burned down by arsonists in 2000, but was later rebuilt. The outdoor village also displays a section of the Berlin Wall, the original sawmill used by Mennonite Conscientious Objectors during their Alternative Service in World War II, and two important monuments originally erected in Russia to commemorate the centennial of Chortitza and honor the two Mennonite leaders, Jacob Hoeppner and Johann Bartsch, who chose the site and accompanied the first colonists. The museum holds numerous special events and festivals, including the Pioneer Days Parade and festival each August. The museum also has a restaurant that serves Russian Mennonite food (open seasonally) and a bookstore (open year-round). In 2018, a statue of Anabaptist martyr Dirk Willems by sculptor Peter Sawatzky was unveiled on the grounds of the museum.

They credited much of their success to their coaches, Mary Jo Hatton Thompson, Don Clause, Ron Riegler, Gene Stickler and Ed Weber, to their chorus Director, Jim Miller, and to their long-time arrangers, Ed Waesche and Walter Latzko. Bluegrass Student Union's members were Allen Hatton (tenor), Ken Hatton (lead), Dan Burgess (baritone), and Rick Staab (bass). Allen Hatton later sang tenor with the original version of the Second Edition quartet to win the Cardinal District Quartet Championship for his second time, in 1986. Ken Hatton later sang lead with the 2000 Cardinal District Champion SENSATIONS quartet, which earned semi-finalist status (20th place) in the 2001 International Quartet Competition.

The Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist, also called the Governance of the Jurist (; ), is a post-Occultation theory in Shia Islam which holds that Islam gives a faqīh (Islamic jurist) custodianship over people. Ulama supporting the theory disagree over how encompassing custodianship should be. One interpretation – Limited Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist – holds that guardianship should be limited to non-litigious matters (al-omour al-hesbiah) including religious endowments (Waqf) judicial mattersInterview: Hamid al-Bayati (May 2003) and the property for which no specific person is responsible. Another – Absolute Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist – maintains that Guardianship should include all issues for which ruler in the absence of Imams have responsibility, including governance of the country. The idea of guardianship as rule was advanced by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a series of lectures in 1970 and now forms the basis of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The constitution of Iran calls for a faqih, or Vali-ye faqih (Guardian Jurist), to serve as the Supreme Leader of the government.Taking Stock of a Quarter Century of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Wilfried Buchta, Harvard Law School, June 2005, p.5–6Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, section 8 Article 109 states an essential qualification of \\"the Leader\\" is \\"scholarship, as required for performing the functions of mufti in different fields of fiqh\\" In the context of Iran, Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist is often referred to as \\"rule by the jurisprudent\\", or \\"rule of the Islamic jurist\\". Theory Wilayat conveys several intricate meanings which are deeply tied to Twelver history. Morphologically, it is derived from the Arabic wilayah, the verbal noun of waliyan: to be near and to have power over something. Technically, wilayat means rule, supremacy or sovereignty. In another sense, wilayat means friendship, loyalty, or guardianship (see Wali).Ahmad Moussavi, The Theory of Wilayat-i Faqih The doctrinal basis of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist comes at least in part from the hadith where Islamic Prophet Muhammad is reputed to have said \\"The ulama are the inheritors of the prophets\\" ().Chapter 14 The issue was mentioned by the earliest Shi'i mujtahids such as al-Shaykh Al-Mufid (948–1022), and enforced for a while by Muhaqqiq Karaki during the era of Tahmasp I (1524–1576). However, according to John Esposito in The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Morteza Ansari (~1781–1864) was the first Islamic scholar to advance the theory of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist.Esposito, John, \\"Ansari, Murtada.\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, (2003). Found in Oxford Islamic Studies Online There is a wide spectrum of ideas about Wilayat-Faqih among Ja'fari scholars and it is not limited to two ideas mentioned above. The spectrum starts from restricting the scope of the doctrine to guardian-less matters (الامور الحسبیه) in Islamic society, such as unattended children, and ends in the idea of absolute authority (الولایه المطلقه) over all public matters. Two kinds of Wilayah can be understood. The first kind mentioned in various chapters of Shia fiqh discusses Wilayah over the dead and Wilayah over those who resemble the dead, such as insane (سفيه), absentee (غائب), poor (فقير), etc. For example, verse 33 of Sura 17 refers to an inheritor of oppressed slain. This type of Wilayah cannot be applied to a society because none of mentioned conditions hold for the majority of a society. The second kind of Wilayah which appears in principles of faith and kalam discusses Wilayah over sane people. The verse 55 of Sura 5 implies the second type of Wilayah in Quran. The Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist can only be argued in terms of this second notion of Wilayah. Recognition of Wilayat-e Faqih is not similar to emulation of a marja but it should be acknowledged by intellectual reason. Limited Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist Traditionally Shi'i jurists have tended to this interpretation, leaving secular power for Shi'i kings called \\"Sultans.\\" They should defend the territory against the non-Shi'a. For example, according to Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian, in centuries of debate among Shi'i scholars, none have \\"ever explicitly contended that monarchies per se were illegitimate or that the senior clergy had the authority to control the state.\\"Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic by Ervand Abrahamian c1993. (Professor of History at Baruch College, in the City University of New York, p. 19 Most scholars viewed the 'ulama's main responsibilities (i.e. their guardianship) as being: *to study the law based on the Qur'an, Sunnah and the teachings of the Twelve Imams. *to use reason *to update these laws; *issue pronouncements on new problems; *adjudicate in legal disputes; and *distribute the Khums contributions to worthy widows, orphans, seminary students, and indigent male descendants of the Prophet.Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic by Ervand Abrahamian c1993. (Professor of History at Baruch College, in the City University of New York According to one of the leading Ayatollahs, Sayyid Sistani, Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist > means every jurisprudent (Faqih) has wilayah (guardianship) over non- > litigious affairs. Non-litigious affairs are technically called \\"al-omour > al-hesbiah\\". As for general affairs with which social order is linked, > wilayah of a Faqih and enforcement of wilayah depend on certain conditions > one of which is popularity of acceptability of Faqih among majority of > momeneen. Notwithstanding his indirect but decisive role in most major Iraqi political decisions, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani has often been identified with the quietist school of thought, which seeks to keep religion out of the political sphere until the return of the Imam of the Age. Similarly, Sistani's mentor the Late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abul Qasim al-Musawi al-Khoei is deemed to be one of the most vocal modern day jurists against the innate nature of Wilayat al-Faqih. Al-Khoei restricted the scope of Wilayat al-Faqih to the jurist's authority in terms of wakalah alone while dismissing the notion of the jurist inheriting the intrinsic authority of the Infallibles. In Al Tanqih fi Sharh al \`Urwatil Wuthqa, Kitab al Ijtihad wa al Taqlid, Pg #360 he states: إن الولاية لم تثبت للفقيه في عصر الغيبة بدليل، وإنما هي مختصة بالنبي والأئمة المعصومين (عليهم السلام)، بل الثابت حسبما يستفاد من الروايات أمران: نفوذ قضائه، وحجّية فتواه. وليس له التصرف في أموال القصّر أو غير ذلك مما هو من شؤون الولاية، إلاّ في الأمر الحسبي، فإن الفقيه له الولاية في ذلك لا بالمعنى المدعى “Wilayah for the faqih in the age of ghaybah is not approved by any evidence whatsoever - and it's only the prerogative of the Messenger and the Imams peace be upon them all, rather the established fact according to the narrations lies in two affairs: Him exercising the role of a judge and his fatwa being a proof - and he holds no authority over the property of a child or others which is from the affairs of wilayah except in the hisbi sense (wakalah), ie. the faqih holds wilayah in this sense not in the sense of being the claimant (al mudda\`ee).” Absolute Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist Supporters of absolute guardianship cite verse 62 of sura 24 and believe that collective affairs () are under the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist at most. Those scholars who believe in the necessity of establishing an Islamic state say that within the boundary of public affairs the guardianship must be absolute, otherwise the state can not govern the country. The idea of the Absolute Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist gained influence with the success of Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership of the Iranian Revolution. Earlier, Khomeini had expanded on it in his book Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist. He presented the concept as necessary to protect and preserve Islam during the Occultation of the Imam. According to Khomeini, society should be governed by those who are the most knowledgeable about Islamic law (Shari'ah). =Velayat-e Faqih in the Iranian constitution= According to the constitution of Iran, Islamic republic is defined as a state ruled by Islamic jurists (Fuqaha). In accordance with verse 21/105 of the Koran and on the basis of two principles of the trusteeship and the permanent Imamate, it is counted as a function of jurists. Also it is explained that only those jurists are entitled to rule who are upright, pious and committed experts on Islam. Also those who are informed of the demands of the times and known as God- fearing, brave and qualified for leadership. Also they must hold the religious office of source of imitation and be permitted to deliver independent judgments on general principles (fatwas). Chapter one of the constitution, where fundamental principles are expressed, states that continual ejtehad by qualified jurists is a principle in Islamic government. Likewise Article 5 expresses that an individual jurist who is endowed with all necessary qualities, or a council of jurists, has the right to rule in the Islamic republic as long as the Twelfth Imam remains in occultation. Also article 57 and 110 show the exact meaning of the ruling jurist's power. According to article 57, the jurist has supervision over three other branches. According to article 110 these supervisory powers are as follow: *Jurist appoints the jurists to the guardian council *He appoints the highest judicial authority in the country *He holds supreme command over the armed forces by exercising some functions *He signs the certificate of appointment of the president *In the national interest, he can dismiss the president *On the recommendation of the supreme courts, he grants amnesty These powers belong to the Supreme Leader as a Vali-e-faqih. Religious and political positions According to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, during the occultation of the Wali al-'Asr, the Guardianship and the Leadership of the Ummah () devolve upon the just and pious jurist, who is fully aware of the circumstances of his age, courageous, resourceful, and possessed of administrative ability. Also, in another article states that the powers of government in the Islamic Republic of Iran are vested in the legislature, the judiciary, and the executive powers, functioning under the supervision of the Absolute Guardianship and the Leadership of the Ummah () that refers to the Supreme Leader of Iran.Constitution of Iran Unofficial English translation hosted at University of Bern, Switzerland (with good summaries) History \\"Limited Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist\\" has been known since Sheikh Mofid, When Ijtihad among the Shi'a emerged in 10th century CE (4th century AH). On the basis of this jurists have judged and take Khoms. Absolute Velayat-e faqih was probably first introduced in the Fiqh of Ja'far al-Sadiq in the famous text book Javaher-ol-Kalaam (). Later, Ayatollah Molla Mohammad Mahdee Naraqi of Iran published a paper advocating a modest level of political actions for Islamic leaderslimited velayat-e-faqih. By the time of Iranian Constitutional Revolution (), Ayatollah Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri customized this theory to match with Iranian Majles of National Council, which was removed when he was executed by those opposed to his idea of Islamic government. Nevertheless, an extensive \\"guardianship\\" was given to clerics. (see: Iranian Constitution of 1906) Ayatullah Khomeini in 1970 gave a series of lectures that became a book Hokumat-e Islami: Valiyat-e faqih (Islamic Government) arguing that monarchy was \\"un-Islamic\\". In a true Islamic state those holding government posts should have knowledge of Sharia, as well as having intelligence and administrative ability. The theory is also a key ideology of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. Velayat-e faqih in practice Clerics in politics of Iran Iran has become the first nation-state in history to apply absolute velayat-e faqih in government. Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist in the Islamic Republic of Iran is represented not only in the Supreme Leader, who must be a cleric, but in other leading bodies, particularly the Assembly of Experts whose members must be clerics, the Council of Guardians, half of whom must be clerics, and the courts. Friday prayer leaders are appointed by the Supreme Leader as well.Wright, The Last Revolution, 2000, p.15–16 Criticism =Opposition among scholars= Quietist scholars of Qom and Najaf hawzas criticise Iranian system of governance, while the Big Four, among them Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, oppose the concept actively.Dueling Ayatollahs Sistani Khamenei Shiite Iran Iraq al-monitor.com Shia split: Sistani and Khamenei clash over Iraq's future alaraby.co.uk In fact, a large segment of the clerical Shia population does not believe in the theory of velayat-e-faqih and thinks the clergy should stay away from politics.The Widening Rift Among Iran's Clerics nytimes.com The majority of Shi'a accepted the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi (1875–1961) as the most prominent scholar. It was only after his death that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini published his first political and social treatise in which he explicitly called for active participation in political matters. Throughout his life, Ayatollah Hosain Borujerdi, who was a quietist and therefore refrained from taking political stances, forbid his student Khomeini from engaging in non-religious matters. =Persecuted scholars in Iran= Twelver Shia Muslims have to follow one of several different marjas in the matters of fiqh. However, Ayatollahs hold different opinions in some of the matters, especially those considering the system of rule during the absence of Imams. Some disapproved of the concept to establish an Islamic rule on Earth before the arrival of Imam Mahdi. Others disagree with the policies implemented by Ayatollah Khomeini, and/or his successor, Ali Khamenei.

History The group was formed by Winston Riley in 1962 while still at school, with the initial line-up also featuring Slim Smith, Franklyn White, and Frederick Waite.Larkin, Colin (1998) \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", Virgin Books, Thompson, Dave (2002) \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, They regularly performed at Edward Seaga's Chocomo Lawn club, where they were spotted by talent scouts from Columbia Records, who released their first single, \\"No One\\", released only in the United Kingdom in 1963. Their Jamaican debut came in 1965 when they were introduced to producer Duke Reid by singer Stranger Cole, with Reid-produced singles such as \\"Don't Leave Me\\", \\"When You Are Wrong\\", and \\"Little Did You Know\\" appearing on labels such as Island Records, and Reid's own Duke and Treasure Isle labels. Smith left the group in 1966, to pursue a solo career at Studio One, and later forming The Uniques with White. He was replaced by Pat Kelly. The shift from ska to rocksteady suited The Techniques, with a string of hits in 1967 and 1968 following, including \\"You Don't Care\\", \\"Queen Majesty\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\", \\"It's You I Love\\", and \\"Love Is Not a Gamble\\". The group left Treasure Isle in 1968, with Riley setting up his own 'Techniques' record label, releasing further sides by the group and also his productions of other artists. The group's line up changed regularly with Riley the only constant member. Other members in the late 1960s included Lloyd Parks, Bruce Ruffin, and Dave Barker. Kelly returned for a time, recording lead vocals on \\"What Am I To Do?\\". Riley became one of the most successful Jamaican producers of the 1980s. Kelly and Ruffin enjoyed successful solo careers. Parks worked as a prolific session musician as well as working as a solo artist. Barker found fame as part of the duo Dave & Ansell Collins. Waite emigrated to the UK where he managed Musical Youth, the band including his sons as members. The Techniques were briefly revived in 1982, with ex-Paragon Tyrone Evans on lead vocals, releasing a re-recorded \\"Love Is Not a Gamble\\", and a new album.

He was known for the many sprinters he trained to the highest level of swimming competition. Blair was one of the first coaches to emphasize that in order to sprint, you must practice sprinting. In fact, most sprint coaches today have based their swim workouts on Blair's method. Coach Blair has trained many notable swimmers, including John Hargis (Olympic gold medalist), Steve Crocker, Doug Boyd, Kicker Vencill, Matt Weghorst, Bobby O'Bryan, Tom Genz, Noel Strauss, and Manuel Twillie. Blair was known around the world for his sprinting methods, which became apparent through the accomplishments of his swim team, the Arkansas Dolphins, based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Blair led the Dolphins to a men's U.S. Open title in 1988 and then a men's National title in 1989 in less than ten years as head coach. It was the smallest team ever to win a United States National Championship. He was also an eight-time USA National Team coach, and coached the Arkansas Dolphins to 10 Region VIII Championship titles and 57 Arkansas State Age Group Championship titles, making him the second winningest coach ever of all sports in the state of Arkansas.

Koch and directed by Gene Saks, and starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. It is the story of two divorced men—neurotic neat-freak Felix Ungar and fun-loving slob Oscar Madison—who decide to live together, even though their personalities clash. The film was successful with critics and audiences, grossing over $44.5 million, making it the third highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States. The success of the film was the basis for the ABC television sitcom of the same name, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman as Felix and Oscar.  Plot  Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) checks into a fleabag hotel near Times Square and attempts to kill himself by jumping out of the window, but he fails to open it and pulls a muscle in his back. Limping back on the street he tries to get drunk at a dance bar (The Metropole) and ends up hurting his neck when he drinks a shot. He stands on a bridge, contemplating jumping into the river. Meanwhile, in the frowzy Upper West Side apartment of divorced sportswriter Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) on a hot and sticky summer evening, Oscar and his buddies Speed (Larry Haines), Roy (David Sheiner), Vinnie (John Fiedler), and policeman Murray (Herb Edelman) are playing poker and discussing their friend, Felix Ungar, who is unusually late for the game. They also complain about how messy the place is—Oscar at one point offers them brown sandwiches and green sandwiches, not knowing what they are. Murray's wife calls and tells him that Felix is missing. Oscar then calls Felix's wife Frances who says that she and Felix have split up. As they are discussing what to do, and worried that Felix might try to commit suicide, Felix arrives not knowing that his friends already know that his wife has kicked him out of the house. Felix eventually breaks down crying and his friends try to console him. Oscar then suggests that Felix move in with him, since Oscar has lived alone since he split up with his own wife, Blanche, several months earlier. Felix agrees, and urges Oscar to not be shy about letting him know if he gets on Oscar's nerves. Within only a week, Oscar is going nuts. Felix is a neurotic, obsessive-compulsive nut, who runs around the apartment cleaning, picking up after Oscar, and berating him for being such a slob. Now the guys complain about how clean the poker game is, even being upset that Felix has washed the cards. He also refuses to have any fun, spending most of his time thinking about Frances. Felix at one point even telephones Oscar at Shea Stadium telling him not to eat any hot dogs at the game, because Felix is preparing franks and beans for dinner; this distraction causes Oscar to miss seeing a rare triple play at the Mets game on which he is reporting. The two men are shown bowling, shooting pool, and walking the city streets. Felix has a sinus attack, making loud obnoxious noises while seated in a coffee shop. Finally, after Felix drives everyone at the weekly poker game crazy, Oscar convinces Felix to lighten up and join him on a double-date with two English girls who live in the building - the Pigeon sisters, Cecily (Monica Evans) and Gwendolyn (Carole Shelley),Possibly a reference to the two young female characters in Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest, who share the same names. who actually \\"coo\\" when they laugh. As the date commences, Oscar tries to get Felix to loosen up by leaving him alone for a while in their living room with the two attractive, and somewhat frisky, sisters. Instead, he winds up talking about Frances, and breaks down weeping. When Oscar returns from their kitchen, the Pigeon sisters, one a divorcee, the other widowed, are sobbing as uncontrollably as Felix. Oscar cheers them up and they invite the boys upstairs for what should be a wild night when it's discovered that the dinner Felix has worked so hard to prepare has essentially gone up in flames. Instead, Felix, who realizes that he is still too attached to his wife, refuses to go, opting to \\"scrub the pots and wash his hair\\" instead. Oscar joins the sisters in their apartment, but winds up spending the night drinking tea and telling them all about Felix. Furious about Felix's ruining the date, Oscar resorts to giving Felix the silent treatment and torturing him by messing up the apartment as much as possible. Felix retaliates by just being himself, driving Oscar insane with his endless cleaning and neurotic behavior. Eventually, the tension explodes into an argument that results in Oscar demanding that Felix move out. Felix complies, but leaves Oscar with a major-league guilt trip for having abandoned his still-in-need friend. Feeling awful about throwing Felix out, and not knowing where he has gone, Oscar assembles his poker buddies to search New York City for Felix in Murray's NYPD police car, which he's not supposed to use for this purpose. After searching for hours, they return to Oscar's apartment to find out that Felix has moved in with the Pigeon sisters. Oscar and Felix apologize to each other, and realize that a bit of each has rubbed off on the other, with each being a better person for it. Felix agrees that next Friday night, he will be at Oscar's apartment for their poker game. The once slobbish Oscar tells his friends to clean up their mess after the poker game is over, ending the film.

For the film version, Matthau reprised his role as Oscar, and Felix was portrayed by Jack Lemmon, who had never played the character before. At one point, Frank Sinatra (as Felix) and Jackie Gleason (as Oscar) were reportedly considered for the film version. Dick Van Dyke and Tony Randall were also among those considered for the role of Felix (the latter portrayed him in the TV series). Similarly, Jack Klugman (who aside from the TV series had replaced Matthau on Broadway) and Mickey Rooney were also to play Oscar. Most of the script from the play has been retained, although the setting is expanded: instead of taking place entirely in Oscar's apartment, Simon also added some scenes that take place at various outdoor New York City locations (such as the scene at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York). Oscar's poker playing cronies were Roy (David Sheiner), Vinnie (John Fiedler), Speed (Larry Haines) and Murray the Cop (Herb Edelman). The film made its debut at Radio City Music Hall in 1968. It was a hit and earned Neil Simon a nomination for the Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Lemmon and Matthau were both nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The scene at Shea Stadium, which also featured Heywood Hale Broun, was filmed right before a real game between the New York Mets and the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 27, 1967. Roberto Clemente was asked to hit into the triple play that Oscar misses, but he refused to do it and Bill Mazeroski took his place. One of the outdoor scenes in the film involved Felix shopping at Bohack, a Maspeth, Queens-based supermarket chain ubiquitous in the New York City area during the mid-20th century. The last Bohack supermarket closed in 1977.Bohack  Theme music  The award-winning jazz instrumental theme was composed by Neal Hefti. The theme was used throughout the movie's sequel, starring Lemmon and Matthau and released 30 years later, and also adapted for the 1970 TV series and used over the opening credits. The song also has seldom-heard lyrics, written by Sammy Cahn.  Release and reception  The Odd Couple garnered both critical acclaim and box-office success; it opened at New York's Radio City Music Hall on May 2, 1968 and ran there for a record-breaking 14 weeks. It grossed over $44.5 million in the United States, making it the third highest-grossing film of 1968.North American rentals were $18.5 million. See \\"Big Rental Films of 1968\\", Variety, 8 January 1969 p 15. Please note this figure is a rental accruing to distributors. The Odd Couple received universal acclaim from critics, earning a 97% \\"Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.05/10. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised the \\"universally good\\" performances, though he noted times when \\"the movie's Broadway origins are painfully evident, as when the players in the poker game are grouped around three sides of the table, but the 'downstage' side is always left bare.\\" Renata Adler of The New York Times called the film \\"a very funny, professional adaptation\\" of the play although \\"Mr. Lemmon sometimes overacts.\\"Adler, Renata (May 3, 1968). \\"Screen: Sweatshirt Meets an Apron\\".

He was the first player for Ireland to take 100 wickets in ODIs. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis. Personal life and education Kevin O'Brien was educated in Marian College, Ballsbridge. He has a degree in marketing and advertising. His brother Niall was also a member of the Irish team. Their father Brendan played 52 times for Ireland. His sister, Ciara, played for the Irish women's hockey team. Career International breakthrough Kevin O'Brien represented Ireland in the Under-19s World Cup of 2004 in which he made 241 runs to help his country reach the Plate Semi-Final before being defeated by Australia. The following year he played for the MCC Young Cricketers. In June 2006 he made his One Day International debut in Ireland's inaugural ODI game, against England in Belfast. Bowling first he took 1 for 47 off his 10 overs as England managed 301. His wicket came off his first delivery and was that of captain Andrew Strauss who was caught at square leg by Andre Botha. Batting at number 8, O'Brien made 35 from 48 balls but Ireland fell 38 runs short. Taking part in Ireland's disappointing World Cricket League campaign in Kenya, O'Brien was one of the success stories. In their second game of the tournament, against Bermuda, O'Brien took his career best figures of 2 for 38 by taking the wickets of middle order batsmen David Hemp and Lionel Cann. In the chase he made 54, his maiden ODI half century and helped his side win with 8 balls to spare. When Ireland made 284 batting first against Kenya in the following game it was O'Brien who made half of the runs. His innings of 142 was the highest ever by an Irish batsman and was made off 128 balls, containing 10 fours and 6 sixes. Ireland then took on Canada and O'Brien continued his good form with the bat by making his 3rd consecutive score of fifty plus with a composed 52. The final game of the tournament came against the Netherlands and despite failing with the bat he took 2 wickets. He finished as the second top scorer in the League with 263 runs at 52.80. The next tour for O'Brien was the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean and it would be his biggest test yet as 6 of his 7 One Day International games prior had been against non-Test playing nations. Their opening game against Zimbabwe finished in a tie when Zimbabwe collapsed in the dying stages. O'Brien came on to bowl in the 49th over with Zimbabwe requiring 9 runs from 12 balls and 3 wickets in hand. His first ball was a full toss but Zimbabwean captain Prosper Utseya hit it straight to Eoin Morgan at cover to give him his first World Cup wicket. Chris Mpofu was run out off O'Brien's final delivery and he finished the penultimate over with a wicket maiden. Ireland came up against Pakistan in the next game and they restricted the Test nation to just 132 with O'Brien taking the wicket of Shoaib Malik. O'Brien came in to bat with his side at 70/4 and he added 38 runs with his brother Niall. Ireland eventually won by 3 wickets and O'Brien finished unbeaten on 16 from 52 balls. His highest score of the tournament came in the Super Eight stage against New Zealand where he made 49, hitting 3 sixes. He missed out on his half century when he was run out by his brother. Arguably his best performance of the World Cup was his fast 48 runs scored against Bangladesh which helped secure a historic Irish victory. On 8 June 2009, O'Brien guided Ireland to victory over Bangladesh in the Twenty20 Cricket World Cup.Ireland Beat Bangladesh. Retrieved on 2009-06-08. O'Brien was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all), although he did not make the shortlist. Trial with Nottinghamshire O'Brien was signed by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 2009 on a trial basis. The previous season O'Brien had scored 93 against the club, impressing Mick Newell, Nottinghamshire's director of cricket. He joined the club after the end of Ireland were knocked out of the Friends Provident Trophy, a domestic competition in England. In his stint with the club, O'Brien played eight list A matches, scoring 79 runs at an average of 13.16 with a highest of 42, and taking one wicket for 72 runs; he also played five T20 matches for Nottinghamshire, scoring 31 runs and taking two wickets. During his time with Nottinghamshire, he also played as a professional for Plumtree Cricket Club in the Nottinghamshire Premier League. Professional contract with Ireland Cricket Ireland, the governing body for cricket in Ireland, awarded O'Brien a full-time \\"category A\\" contract in January 2010. He was one of six players to be awarded such contracts with Cricket Ireland (four players received category B contracts and five category C), and came just a year after the first professional contracts were awarded to Ireland's cricketers. Before that players were amateurs relying on income from other jobs and playing cricket in their spare time. The contract allowed O'Brien and the others to focus on cricket, with the aim of improving ahead of the 2011 World Cup. In Ireland's first match at the Sri Lanka Associates T20 Series against Afghanistan, O'Brien performed poorly overall. With the bat he managed only 1 run from 2 balls before having to depart. His bowling figures ended at 0–34, but Ireland managed to seal the win by 5 wickets. In their second match against Canada, O'Brien finished with 0–38 in the Canadian innings, and 5 off 2 balls with the bat as Ireland narrowly lost by 4 runs. In the third and final game (against Sri Lanka A), O'Brien ended the tournament wicketless after 0–15 off two overs. He managed 11 off ten balls as Ireland put in a spirited performance but lost by 5 wickets. The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium cricket ground in India where O'Brien scored the fastest century in World Cup history. In 2010, O'Brien was again nominated for the Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year Award, this time alongside two other Ireland players (there were 16 nominees in all); the award was given to Netherlands Ryan ten Doeschate. O'Brien was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. On 2 March O'Brien hit the fastest century in World Cup history, off just 50 balls against England helping his team to successfully chase down a target of 328 when at one stage they were struggling at 111/5. In that World Cup match against England he along with Alex Cusack set the highest ever 6th wicket partnership in World Cup history (162). Ireland won two of their matches, but failed to progress beyond the first round, finishing six out of seven in their group. With 198 runs at an average of 39.60, O'Brien finished as Ireland's second highest run-scorer in the tournament. On 23 May 2013, at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground, Dublin, he scored an unbeaten 84 in 47 balls against Pakistan which helped the Ireland to tie the match. Ireland required 15 runs in the last over to win the match, O'Brien hit last ball of Saeed Ajmal to boundary to pull out a thrilling 'tie' for the Irish team. County cricket O'Brien's performance at the World Cup attracted the attention of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and he secured a contract with the club for 2011. John Bracewell, Gloucestershire's coach, viewed O'Brien as primarily a one-day player and believed his style of batting was best suited to situations where the team needed to increase their run- rate. He made his debut for Gloucestershire on 15 May, scoring three runs from four balls in a CB40 match against Glamorgan. In June he scored his first century in twenty20 cricket, beating his previous highest score of 39. His innings of 119 runs against Middlesex came from 52 deliveries and helped lift Gloucestershire to the highest total in the history of domestic T20 cricket. O'Brien shared an opening stand of 192 with Hamish Marshall, who also scored a century, and the pair set a record partnership for any wicket in the format.(But this record was broken in just a few years) When O'Brien was finally dismissed, he received a standing ovation. Both Kevin O'Brien and Hamish Marshall became the first pair of batsmen to score centuries in a single T20. O'Brien also signed a contract to play in the first season of the Sri Lankan Premier League, which was scheduled to take place in late July and early August, however the competition was postponed until 2012, allowing O'Brien to spend more time at Gloucestershire. His stint with Gloucestershire also clashed with some of Ireland's international matches. Scotland hosted Ireland and Sri Lanka in July for a tri-series; Ireland's match against Sri Lanka was rained off and in the Scotland match O'Brien was dismissed off his first ball. After the internationals O'Brien returned to Gloucestershire, and again helped his team to victory over Middlesex, this time scoring 58 not out from 35 balls. Gloucestershire finished the Friend's Life t20 competition with four wins from sixteen matches, leaving them 8th out of nine teams in their group. O'Brien – who scored 365 runs from 14 matches, making him the club's second-highest run-scorer in the competition, just two runs behind Marshall – felt he had been consistent with the bat for Gloucestershire, but that his bowling had been underused. Such was O'Brien's effect on the team was that, along with batsman Paul Stirling, he was one of two Ireland players shortlisted for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at the 2011 ICC Awards. Although a full-strength team played against England in an ODI in August, county commitments meant many of Ireland's senior players were unavailable to play in the team's opening match of the 2011–13 Intercontinental Cup. With regular captain William Porterfield playing for Warwickshire and Trent Johnston who often stood in injured, O'Brien was chosen to lead Ireland against Namibia. He had led Ireland in one-day matches before, but this was the first time he had captained in first-class cricket. In October Ireland sent a seven-man squad captained by O'Brien to participate in the Hong Kong Sixes. At the start of 2012 O'Brien was made Ireland's vice captain, taking over the role from Trent Johnston. Soon after, Cricket Ireland increased the number of players with contracts from 15 to 23; O'Brien was one of four players to be given a category A contract. In February 2012 Ireland toured Kenya for an Intercontinental Cup match followed by two ODIs and two T20Is. During the tour O'Brien was fined 20% of his match fee for \\"using offensive language when leaving the field after being bowled\\". Kevin O'Brien has signed for Gloucestershire County Club to play a single season in 2016 in all First-class, List A, and T20 and he is a List A specialist. Test cricket and beyond In May 2018, he was named in a fourteen-man squad for Ireland's first ever Test match, which was played against Pakistan later the same month. He made his Test debut for Ireland, against Pakistan, on 11 May 2018, becoming the first sportsperson from Ireland to appear in 300 matches for his country. He was the top scorer for Ireland in the first innings, with 40 runs. In the second innings of the match, he scored Ireland's first ever Test fifty, and then first ever Test century. Despite Ireland losing the Test by five wickets, O'Brien won the man of the match award for his batting performance. In January 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for their one- off Test against Afghanistan in India. O'Brien recorded his second 50 in the second innings. In September 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Ahead of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as the key player in Ireland's squad. Later the same month, during the 2019–20 Oman Pentangular Series, O'Brien became the first batsman for Ireland to score a century in a T20I match, when he made 124 against Hong Kong. On 10 July 2020, O'Brien was named in Ireland's 21-man squad to travel to England to start training behind closed doors for the ODI series against the England cricket team. Playing style O'Brien is a strong batsman, with the ability to clear the ropes. In his record-breaking century against England in the 2011 World Cup he hit the longest six of the tournament. His brother Niall stated that \\"in the field he was grumpy, he was moping around ... when he's like that, he tends to kinda take the bull by the horns\\". In March 2011 Ireland's coach, Phil Simmons, remarked of O'Brien that \\"There's a lot more thought to his batting and he has worked on different things like batting against spin. He doesn't have the facilities of a county but he is working hard on his game at home.\\" Footnotes References External links  1984 births Irish cricketers Ireland Test cricketers Ireland One Day International cricketers Ireland Twenty20 International cricketers Living people Cricket players from County Dublin Nottinghamshire cricketers Cricketers at the 2007 Cricket World Cup Cricketers at the 2011 Cricket World Cup Cricketers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Gloucestershire cricketers Somerset cricketers Irish cricket captains Surrey cricketers Trinbago Knight Riders cricketers Rangpur Rangers cricketers Northern Districts cricketers Leinster Lightning cricketers Leicestershire cricketers Cricketers who made a century on Test debut Kandahar Knights cricketers People from Sandymount ","title":"Kevin O'Brien (cricketer)"},{"id":"6492655","text":"Griesedieck Brothers Beer is a historic St. Louis beer brand that has been reintroduced after years of absence. The Griesedieck family once owned three St. Louis-area breweries, Griesedieck Brothers Brewery, Griesedieck Western Brewery Co. in Belleville, Illinois (producers of Stag Beer) and the Falstaff Brewing Corporation, producer of Falstaff Beer. Family brewing tradition  German immigrant Anton Griesedieck brought his family brewing tradition (dating from 1766 in Stromberg, Germany) to St. Louis in about 1866. He owned a series of breweries, employing his four sons, including Henry Jr. and Joseph \\"Papa Joe,\\" and nephew Henry L. Griesedieck who would later found Griesedieck Western Brewery Co.Leonard, Melinda. \\"Joseph Griesedieck.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified September 25, 2014. The four sons established the National Brewery Co. in 1891, which later became part of the Independent Breweries Company in 1907. Henry Jr. ran IBC for four years until he quit to help his five sons Anton, Henry, Raymond, Edward and Robert found Griesedieck Brothers Brewery Co. in 1911. GB made non-alcoholic beer and soft drinks during Prohibition, but closed its doors by 1920. For the next 13 years, the Griesedieck Brothers would anxiously bide their time before they could once again brew what would become the most popular beer in St. Louis.  Post-Prohibition  Harry Caray, behind the microphone for a radio broadcast sponsored by Griesedieck Brothers After prohibition ended, the heirs of Henry Jr. kept Griesedieck Brothers while the heirs of Papa Joe ran Falstaff. Starting in 1947, Griesedieck Brothers sponsored the St. Louis Cardinals radio broadcasts with Harry Caray until the Anheuser-Busch brewery bought the team in 1953. Shortly after Anheuser-Busch bought the team, it renamed Sportsman's Park as Busch Stadium and introduced Busch Beer. This new beer was sold at new low prices and significantly dug into Griesedieck Brothers sales. When Edward Griesedieck, the last remaining original Griesedieck Brother died in 1955, the company looked at its options. In 1957, Griesedieck Brothers was sold to its cousins at Falstaff and production under the GB name stopped almost overnight. The Griesedieck brewery, at that point, was the most updated brewery in the nation, with production over 1,000,000 barrels per year. Falstaff thus moved all production into the former GB plant. Falstaff's peak production year was 1966 at 6,000,000 barrels, declining thereafter. When Falstaff got hit with court costs involving the acquisition of Narragansett beer, the company had to sell. Paul Kalmanovitz purchased the company in 1975 and moved the headquarters to California. By 1977, the old GB plant was closed down. Through various mergers and acquisitions, Pabst Brewing Company eventually acquired the Falstaff brand, but quit production in 2005.  Present-day  Family descendant Raymond A. Griesedieck, son of Henry A. Griesedieck (the last president of the original Griesedieck Brothers), incorporated the new Griesedieck Brothers Brewery Company in 1992. By 2002, Griesedieck Brothers Beer re-emerged in the St. Louis beer market. Raymond A. Griesedieck owns the GB shield and Griesedieck Bros. trademarks. Griesedieck Brothers Brewery has provided to various local establishments in the St. Louis area since 2002. The original Griesedieck Beer was a classic American lager. The current incarnations include Golden Pilsner (a German pilsner beer) and Unfiltered Bavarian-Style Wheat (a German hefeweizen). References *St. Louis Post- Dispatch, July 14, 2006, page. B1.

The tournaments fixtures were to be held originally in the cities of Dambulla and Colombo, but were later revised to be played only in Colombo. Each team was to play 4 matches, 2 against each opponent, with the best 2 teams qualifying for the final. Despite statistics pointing out Sri Lanka to be favourites at home, the series was tipped to be one of the most competitive tournaments in a while. This was despite many key injuries in the South African squad.  Safety Issues  On the eve of the tournament, the opening match, between Sri Lanka and South Africa, on 14 August 2006, was called off due to torrential rain. With reserve days for each scheduled match, this was not a major issue, but a bomb blast that occurred only 2 kilometres away from the stadium endangered the tournament. This was due to increased concerns from the South African players, who were ready to pull out, but were willing to continue playing if Security Evaluations deemed it safe. An official statement from the South African Cricket Board was made, stating that the team would pull out, due to the current risk being at an \\"unacceptable level\\".

Consisting of a concert hall, City Hall, and a clocktower, the Group is a center of government and culture in the city. The Municipal Complex's architecture is a notable example of the City Beautiful style made popular by Daniel Burnham, an architect from Chicago, Illinois, in the early 20th century. Layout A typical illustration of the building used by city offices, with Symphony Hall visible at the left, and City Hall to the right of the campanile respectively. Bounded by Court and Pynchon Streets, East Columbus Ave, and City Hall Place, the Municipal Group consists of two Greek Revival buildings which house City Hall and Symphony Hall, originally built as the Municipal Auditorium. Between the two is the Italianate Campanile clock tower. With a carillon of twelve bells, it plays sixteen notes of Handel's Messiah. The face of the clock is fourteen feet in diameter. When originally built, the clock and elevator were powered by water. The Municipal Group looks out onto Court Square and the city's Old First Church. Symphony Hall Symphony Hall is a concert venue located on the south end of the complex. Constructed between 1911–1913 and originally known as \\"The Auditorium,\\" Symphony Hall is known for its excellent acoustics and Greek Revival architecture. Symphony Hall has a current seating capacity of 2,611 people. Initially it seated over 1,000 more people; however, it has been renovated several times to meet modern seating standards - and modern body sizes - and thus lost seats. The Auditorium was renamed Symphony Hall during the 1940s, after it became the main performance venue for the progressive Springfield Symphony Orchestra. It is also home to Broadway-style theatre, children’s programming, internationally recognized speakers, and the yearly induction ceremony for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as well as numerous concerts and performances. Symphony Hall is managed by MGM Springfield. MGM Springfield also manages the MassMutual Center in downtown Springfield. Springfield Symphony Hall was rededicated in 1980 and underwent an extensive renovation in the fall of 2004. History In 1905, Springfield's first city hall was destroyed by fire. According to legend a monkey upended a kerosene lamp, which ultimately engulfed the building in flames. The city, at the time an industrial powerhouse in New England, financed construction of a grand municipal complex. During construction, the clocktower was bombed by anarchist Ortie McManigle, the same culprit as the Los Angeles Times bombing. However, the thick walls were not disturbed by the truck bomb, and it was completed in 1913. Former Mayor John A. Denison and President William Howard Taft officiated the opening ceremonies. On December 8, 1913, as Taft dedicated the Springfield Municipal Group as \\"one of the most distinctive civic centers in the United States, and indeed the world.\\" Over the years, the Municipal Group came to represent the city itself as its most identifiable landmark. Following the end of each of the World Wars, the carillon of bells tolled before jubilant crowds. Due to a legal height restriction in Springfield imposed by the Massachusetts State Legislature in 1908, the Campanile remained the tallest structure in the city until 1973 when Bay State West (now called Tower Square) was built. Its views would remain largely unobstructed until the construction of Monarch Place in 1987. Over time, as the city's fortunes deteriorated, so did the Municipal Group. Their age made them notoriously expensive to heat and cool. Symphony Hall remained in comparatively good shape, due to the money coming in from performances. However, City Hall and especially the Campanile languished. Sporadic renovations barely would keep City Hall operable. The aging electrical system in the Campanile silenced the bells and structural instability closed it off. The time on each of the clock's faces was rarely correct. Falling debris required officials to constantly widen the area off-limits to passers-by. The tower stood in danger of collapse. In 2006, the city's Finance Control Board authorized a new capital investment plan, which included money for renovate the entire Municipal Group complex, mostly prominently the Campanile. The improving finances of the city permitted the Control Board to issue bonds to finance the SMG's portion of the capital plan. Before the announcement, a partial renovation of City Hall was underway and will be expanded as a result.

He has previously served as Chairman of the New Black Panther Party. , he is the current National President of Black Lawyers for Justice, which he co-founded. Shabazz announced on an October 14, 2013 online radio broadcast that he was stepping down from his leadership position in the New Black Panther Party and that Hashim Nzinga, then national chief of staff, would replace him. He is an occasional guest on television talk shows. The Anti- Defamation League describes Shabazz as \\"anti-Semitic and racist\\" and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)'s Intelligence Project's Intelligence Report, which monitors what the SPLC considers radical right hate groups and extremists in the United States has included Shabazz in its files since a 2002 Washington, D.C. protest at B'nai B'rith International at which Shabazz shouted: \\"Kill every goddamn Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist supermarkets!\\" Early life and legal career Shabazz was born in 1966 as Paris Lewis and raised in Los Angeles. Shabazz says his father, James Lewis, was a Muslim who was killed when Shabazz was a child. Shabazz was raised by his mother, whom he describes as a successful businesswoman. His grandfather, who introduced him to the Nation of Islam, was also a strong influence. Shabazz graduated from Howard University and Howard University School of Law. In 1994, Shabazz was fired from a position with then Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, who criticized Shabazz for statements \\"regarding other people's cultural history, religion and race that do not reflect the spirit of my campaign, my personal views or my spirituality.\\" In 1995, while he was a law student, Shabazz ran his first unsuccessful campaign for a seat on the Council of the District of Columbia. In 1996, Shabazz founded Black Lawyers for Justice. In 1998, Shabazz was named \\"Young Lawyer of the Year\\" by the National Bar Association, the nation's leading black lawyers' association, and ran, unsuccessfully again, for a seat on the D.C. Council. Public attention Shabazz first came to widespread public attention in 1994, when Unity Nation, a student group he founded at Howard University, invited Khalid Abdul Muhammad, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, to speak. Introducing the speaker, Shabazz engaged in a call and response with the audience: A year later, Shabazz told an interviewer that everything he said was true, with the possible exception of the assertion concerning Nat Turner. New Black Panther Party Shabazz followed Muhammad's lead and joined the New Black Panther Party about 1997. When Muhammad, who greatly expanded the organization and rose to its chairmanship, died in early 2001, Shabazz took over as National Chairman. The principles Shabazz purports to promote include the following: *Black nationalism *Black Power *Support for reparations for slavery *Conspiracy theories about Jewish involvement in the September 11 attacks *The view that Jews dominated the Atlantic slave trade *Anti-Zionism Prevented from entering Canada In May 2007, Shabazz was invited by Black Youth Taking Action (BYTA) to speak at a rally at Queen's Park in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and to give a lecture to students at Ryerson University. Shabazz arrived at Toronto Pearson International Airport as planned but Canada border officials prevented him from entering Canada because of past rhetoric that violated Canadian hate laws. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty expressed concern about Shabazz. The press reported that Shabazz was denied entry to Canada because of a minor criminal record. Shabazz flew back to Buffalo, New York and attempted to cross the border by car, but border agents spotted him and again prevented him from entering Canada. 2015 demonstrations in Baltimore Shabazz helped organize and promote a demonstration in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 25, 2015, following the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man who died while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department. Addressing the crowd, Shabazz called for them to \\"Shut it down if you want to! Shut it down!\\" Shabazz planned another protest on May 2, 2015. Some in Baltimore who had been involved with the peaceful protests expressed concerns to The Baltimore Sun about his involvement. Rev. Alvin S. Gwynn, Jr., who leads the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore, described Shabazz as an \\"outside agitator\\" and another local pastor, Rev. Louis Wilson, said Shabazz does not speak for all African-Americans. Wilson added, \\"I've talked to people who wish he'd just stay away.\\" References Further reading * External links * 1966 births Living people African- American lawyers African and Black nationalists Antisemitism in the United States Howard University alumni Howard University School of Law alumni 9/11 conspiracy theorists Lawyers from Los Angeles Reparations for slavery American conspiracy theorists ","title":"Malik Zulu Shabazz"},{"id":"6492709","text":"Thomas M.

She is overall a three-time women's world champion under different incarnations and recognitions. Burke's heyday lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, when she held the NWA World Women's Championship for almost twenty years. Burke started out in 1935, wrestling men at carnivals. She was managed by her second husband, promoter Billy Wolfe. She is a charter member of WWE Hall of Fame's Legacy Wing, Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.  Early life  Mildred Burke, aged 15, began to work as a waitress on the Zuni Indian Reservation in Gallup, New Mexico. She lived there for three years, before leaving for Kansas City after agreeing to marry her boyfriend. He took her to a professional wrestling event, which sparked her interest in the sport. Burke, who was pregnant at the time, later persevered.  Professional wrestling career  Burke in 1937 Prior to wrestling, she was an office stenographer by day, had outstanding muscle development, and was hoping to become a professional wrestler.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 290, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . Locally, Billy Wolfe was training aspiring women professional wrestlers. At first, Wolfe did not want to train Burke and instructed a male wrestler to body slam her, so she would stop asking Wolfe to train her. Burke, however, performed a body slam on the man instead, which resulted in Wolfe agreeing to train her.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p.44–45. Wolfe tutored her and realized that she was the prospect for which he was waiting. The close proximity of their training resulted in a relationship and ultimately marriage. Changing her name to Mildred Burke, she defeated Clara Mortenson for the Women's World Championship in January 1937. In the 1930s, Burke wrestled over 200 men, but only lost to one of them.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 33. Despite the riches that her husband earned as a promoter of women grapplers, there was a dark side to their marriage. On the road, Wolfe stood as a father figure to the women he trained and managed, but he also earned a reputation as a womanizer. Their marriage was not monogamous, as Wolfe enjoyed the companionship of women with whom he traveled.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 291, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, .  Divorce from Billy Wolfe  Tensions emanated from the extramarital activity and in 1952, Wolfe and Burke went their own ways. Burke found herself frozen out of professional wrestling among all National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) channels. Desperate, Burke decided to consult Jack Pfefer for help. The NWA attempted to reconcile the couple, but the only agreed upon solution was that one would sell out to the other. Burke volunteered to sell to Wolfe for Burke's Attractions, Inc. went into bankruptcy and into the hands of receiver James Hoff of Columbus. Eight months later, Hoff named Wolfe as administrator and was approved by Franklin County Judge William Bryant. A memorandum dated August 20, 1953, was circulated by Wolfe, in which he boldly announced that he was the booker for Burke and her stable of 27 wrestlers. The claim was disputed by Burke on August 26, 1953, by stating that the issue would be settled in the courts. It was emphasized that her contract prohibited Wolfe from competing in wrestling and was in breach of the binding agreement. She consulted with Leroy McGuirk and hoped that she would be vindicated by the NWA at their September 1953 meeting in Chicago.  Dealings with the NWA  Burke faced many obstacles, as women were banned from yearly NWA conferences, and this diminished the importance of women in professional wrestling.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 292, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . An example of the discrimination was evident during the dispute with Wolfe. Burke sat in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago as male dignitaries argued behind closed doors about her future. Wolfe's voice was the only one heard by the membership. In the end, the NWA declined to recognize women's wrestling after the meeting, Wolfe regained his stake, but many women were loyal to Burke and refused to wrestle for Wolfe.  Genuine animosity  In a letter to NWA members on November 4, 1953, Burke refuted Wolfe's claim that she would wrestle only one woman grappler. She claimed that there were twelve grapplers with whom she would work. Wolfe, however, used his influence to get her frozen from NWA members and her promising run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled. Emotionally exhausted, Burke wrestled Wolfe's daughter-in-law June Byers and there was genuine heat between the two. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in Atlanta. It was a grudge match that quickly became a shoot fight, due to genuine enmity between the two women.Molinaro, John F.: Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, page 177, Winding Stair Press, 2002. Wolfe had the local commission in his corner and slid a friendly referee into the match. Burke later admitted that she had given up the legitimate first fall with the intention of competing stronger in the second. The second fall never had a finish. Officials called the match, and Burke left the ring believing that her title was safe because she had not lost two falls. The result was that many in the press stated that Byers had defeated her and the importance of Burke's championship began to diminish.  Legacy  A Jacksonville, Florida poster advertises Burke In the early 1950s, Burke started the World Women's Wrestling Association in Los Angeles, California. She returned to her promotion after her match with Byers, still recognizing herself as the World Women's Champion even after the NWA had recognized rival June Byers as champion since then, and continued to defend it. She vacated the title in 1956, when she retired from professional wrestling. In 1970, the title was revived by All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) as their top prize. After the tensions with Wolfe and the NWA, Burke traveled with an escort for the rest of her career as a protective measure. She started International Women's Wrestlers Inc. with Bill Newman and the promotion had offices in New York City, San Francisco and Sydney, Australia.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 293, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . These offices served in the dual capacity of booking offices and training centers. Her efforts to spread women's wrestling internationally reached Japan and brought about the World Wide Women's Wrestling Association (WWWA). Mildred Burke introduced women's wrestling to several countries, including almost every state of the United States, Canada, Cuba, Mexico and some parts of the Orient: Japan, Hong Kong, Macao and the Philippines. All Japan Women's Pro- Wrestling (AJW) bought the legal rights of the WWWA World Championship from her and later created the WWWA World Tag Team Championship, in 1971 and the All Pacific Championship, in 1977. In her later years, Burke ran a women's wrestling school in Encino, California.MILDRED BURKE, 73, DIES AFTER STROKE – February 14, 1989 Among her students was Canadian Rhonda Sing, who went on to fame as WWWA World Champion, Monster Ripper, and later WWF Women's Champion Bertha Faye. Burke died from a stroke on February 18, 1989 in Northridge, California, and was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. In 2002, she was posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. On April 2, 2016, Burke was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a \\"Legacy\\" member.
