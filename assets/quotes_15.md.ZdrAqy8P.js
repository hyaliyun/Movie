The station opened on 1 December 1917 as the terminus of the line from Newport.Altona VicsigAltona Station Rail Geelong History The railway to Altona was constructed by the Altona Bay Estate Company, a private land developer, and opened on 9 November 1888 to a station named Altona Beach, which was about a kilometre to the east of the current station. As a result of the collapse of the 1880s Land Boom, regular services to Altona Beach ceased after August 1890, and the Victorian government declined the offer of the owners to gift it the line. In the 1890s, the company opened a brown coal mine near the terminus of the line, and in 1907, a siding was built in the same area to enable sand to be despatched by rail. In 1910, the Altona Brown Coal Colliery Company began railing quantities of brown coal, using a siding which was a north-west extension of the Altona line. In 1917, the owners of the railway entered into an agreement with the Victorian Railways (VR) to provide a regular passenger service, having guaranteed to cover any operating losses. On 1 December 1917, the VR opened a new Altona Beach station on the present site. For a period of time, de-motored McKeen railmotors were used as carriages on steam-hauled passenger services. By 1924, the private owner of the Altona line owed the VR ¬£7,289, being the accumulated deficit on operating passenger services, so the VR took full control of the line on 1 October 1924. The track was electrified in 1926, and the station was renamed Altona in 1938. Apart from a few direct trains between Altona and Melbourne in peak periods, all trains were run as shuttle services between Newport and Altona. By the early 1980s, the station, and the line itself, was under threat of closure, as recommended in the Lonie Report. In October 1981, the rail service was drastically cut, with all shuttle services withdrawn, and only two morning and evening trains being run to and from Melbourne. However, a change of state government in 1982 saw the restitution of many services in July that year. The line was subsequently extended to Westona on 21 January 1985, and to Laverton, on 14 April 1985.\\"Victoria\\" Railway Digest March 1985 page 97\\"Victoria\\" Railway Digest May 1985 page 151 Platforms and services Altona has one platform.

In the novels, his background is the least developed of the pilgrims and he contributes the least to their efforts. He is called Sand or Sandy and is known as a \\"water buffalo\\" for his seemingly less developed intelligence in many English versions of the story. His Buddhist name \\"Sha Wujing\\", given by the bodhisattva Guanyin, means \\"sand aware of purity\\". His name is rendered in Korean as Sa Oh Jeong, into Japanese as Sa Goj≈ç, into Sino-Vietnamese as Sa Ng·ªô T·ªãnh. He is also known as \\"Monk Sha\\", (literary Chinese: Sa TƒÉng in Sino- Vietnamese and Sua Cheng in Thai), or Sha Heshang Ê≤ôÂíåÂ∞ö (colloquial Chinese). Overview Like Zhu Bajie, Wujing was originally a general in Heaven, more specifically a Curtain-Lifting General (Âç∑Â∏òÂ§ßÂ∞Ü ju«énli√°n d√†ji√†ng). In a fit of rage, he destroyed a valuable vase. Other sources mention that he did this unintentionally, and it was an accident. Nevertheless, he was punished by the Jade Emperor, who had him struck 800 times with a rod and exiled to earth, where he was to be reincarnated as a terrible man-eating sand demon. There, he lived in the Li√∫shƒÅ-h√© (ÊµÅÊ≤ôÊ≤≥, \\"flowing-sand river\\", or \\"quicksand-river\\"). As a punishment, every day, seven flying swords sent from heaven would stab him in the chest before flying off. As a result, he had to live in the river to avoid the punishment. Character as portrayed in Peking opera Wujing's appearance was rather grisly; he had a red beard and his head was partially bald; a necklace consisting of skulls made him even more terrible. He still carried the weapon he had in Heaven, a magic wooden staff created by Lu Ban. There is an interesting story about the necklace of skulls: An earlier group of nine monks on a pilgrimage west to fetch the scriptures met their end at the hands of Wujing. Despite their pleas for mercy, he devoured them, sucked the marrow from their bones, and threw their skulls into the river. However, unlike his other victims whose bone sank to the river bottom, the skulls of the monks floated. This fascinated and delighted Wujing, who strung them on a rope and played with them whenever he was bored. Later, Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, and her disciple Prince Moksha came searching for powerful bodyguards in preparation of Tang Sanzang's journey west. She recruited Wujing in exchange for some relief from his suffering. She then converted him and gave him his current name, ShƒÅ W√πj√¨ng. His surname ShƒÅ (\\"sand\\") was taken from his river-home, while his Buddhist name W√πj√¨ng means \\"awakened to purity\\" or \\"aware of purity\\". Finally, he was instructed to wait for a monk who would call for him. When Wujing does meet Tang Sanzang, he was mistaken for an enemy and attacked by Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie. Guanyin was forced to intervene for the sake of the journey. After everything was cleared up, Wujing became the third disciple of Tang Sanzang, who called him ShƒÅ-h√©sh√†ng (, i.e. the \\"sand priest\\"; a h√©sh√†ng is a Buddhist monk or priest in charge of a temple; in Japanese, osh≈ç). Now, he was clad in a Buddhist pilgrim's robe and his skull- necklace was turned into a bhikkhu's one. During the Journey to the West, his swimming ability was quite useful. He always carried a small gourd which he could turn into a huge one to cross rivers. Wujing was actually a kind-hearted and obedient person and was very loyal to his master, among the three he was likely the most polite and the most logical. At the journey's end, Buddha transformed him into an arhat known as the Golden-bodied Arhat (). As the third disciple, even though his fighting skills are not as great as that of Wukong or Bajie, he is still a great warrior protecting Tang Sanzang and can use his intellect as well as his strength to beat the enemy. He knows only 18 forms of transformation and admits this as reported in the middle of the narrative. Character origins Sha Wujing is the end result of embellishing a supernatural figure mentioned in Monk Hui Li's () 7th-century account of the historical Xuanzang called Daciensi Sanzang Fashi Zhuan (, A Biography of the Tripitaka-master of the Great Ci'en Monastery). According to the text, Xuanzang spilled his surplus of water while in the deserts near Dunhuang. After several days without liquid, Xuanzang had a dream where a tall spirit wielding a ji (halberd) chastised him for sleeping on such an important journey to get scriptures from India. He immediately woke up and got on his horse, which took off in a different direction than what he wanted to go. They finally came to an oasis with green grass and fresh water.Dudbridge, Glen. The Hsi-Yu Chi: A Study of Antecedents to the Sixteenth-Century Chinese Novel. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1970, pp. 18‚Äì19 The Tang Sanzang ji (Âîê‰∏âËóèËÆ∞, Record of the Tang Monk Tripitaka), a book of unknown date appearing in an 11th-century Japanese collection of tales known as J≈çbodai sh≈´ (ÊàêËè©Â†§ÈõÜ), states Xuanzang (Tang Sanzang) was magically provided food and drink by a Deva while in the \\"Flowing Sands\\" (liusha, ÊµÅÊ≤ô) desert.The original source says \\"Moving sands,\\" but here the wording is changed to conform with that commonly used in English translations of the tale. \\"Moving Sands\\" (liusha, ÊµÅÊ≤ô) was a common term for the desert area of the northwestern territories of China (Dudbridge, p. 19 n. 3). The compiler of the J≈çbodai sh≈´ explained: \\"This is the reason for the name Spirit of the Deep Sands (Shensha shen, Ê∑±Ê≤ôÁ•û).\\"Dudbridge, p. 19 After performing a pilgrimage to China in 838‚Äì839, the Japanese Buddhist monk J≈çgy≈ç (Â∏∏Êôì) wrote a report which mentions Xuanzang's fabled exchange with the deity, as well as equates Shensha shen with King Vai≈õrava·πáa, one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism.Dudbridge, pp. 19‚Äì20 Therefore, the Tang Sanzang ji most likely hails from the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907). The J≈çbodai sh≈´ also mentions the god manifested itself before the famous Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian (c. 4th century) during his pilgrimage to India. Shensha shen tells him: \\"I am manifested in an aspect of fury. My head is like a crimson bowl. My two hands are like the nets of heaven and earth. From my neck hang the heads of seven demons. About my limbs are eight serpents, and two demon heads seem to engulf my (nether-) limbs‚Ä¶\\"Dudbridge, p. 20 The golden statues at the Rua Yai City Pillar Shrine in Suphan Buri, Thailand By the compiling of the \\"K≈çzanji version\\" (È´òÂ±±ËÆ∞, 13th century), the earliest known edition of Journey to the West, Shensha shen was transformed into a blood thirsty demon who had continuously eaten Tang Sanzang's past reincarnations. The demon tells him: \\"Slung here from my neck are the dry bones from when I twice before devoured you, monk!\\" Shensha Shen only helps him to pass over the deep sands with the aid of a magic golden bridge after Tang Sanzang threatens him with heavenly retribution.Dudbridge, pp. 20‚Äì21 As can be seen, the complete version of Journey to the West anonymously published in 1592 borrowed liberally from tales concerning Shensha shen. The character of Sha Wujing was given his monstrous appearance and dress. The skulls of the nine Buddhist monks hanging from his head recalls both the demon skulls worn by the spirit, and the skulls of Tang Sanzang's past incarnations worn by his wrathful counterpart from the K≈çzanji version. His home of the \\"Flowing Sands River\\" (Liusha he ÊµÅÊ≤ôÊ≤≥) is derived from the \\"Flowing Sands\\" desert inhabited by Shensha shen. Sha Wujing also aids Tang Sanzang pass over the Flowing Sands River by tying his nine skulls into a makeshift raft.Yu, Anthony C. The Journey to the West (Vol. 1).

The station opened on 28 February 1932 to coincide with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. History Building Sydney Rail Network, ca. 1926, Arthur Ernest Foster Wynyard railway station, 1940s Former tram tunnels leading to disused platforms 1 and 2 The station opened on 28 February 1932.Wynyard Station NSWrail.net Wynyard was originally constructed with six platforms (the existing four platforms are still numbered from 3 to 6), with platforms 1-4 located on the upper level and platforms 5 and 6 on the lower level. The original intention was that Platforms 1 and 2, located adjacent to platforms 3 and 4, would eventually serve the eastern pair of railway tracks across the Harbour Bridge. In the interim, they were used as a terminus for North Shore tram services on Sydney's tram network, a service that operated over those tracks from the bridge's opening in 1932 until 1958. A feature of these lines was Australia's only underground tram terminus. On 22 January 1956, the lines from platforms 5 and 6 were extended to Circular Quay as part of the City Circle. Former tram tunnels In 1968, platforms 1 and 2 were walled off from 3 and 4, and part of the space converted into an underground car park for the Menzies Hotel. The tunnels were accessed from Wynyard Lane where a descending ramp was cut west under Wynyard Park to the disused platforms. The car park used both tunnels north from the former platforms to an exit cut in from Cumberland Street just south of Essex Street. The Wynyard Lane Car Park was closed in October 2016 to make way for the mixed-use Wynyard Place development which would obstruct the entrance ramp to the tunnels. The remainder of the tunnels north of the car park exit were walled off as were the northern portals on the Harbour Bridge. North of the portals, two additional road lanes were built above the old tramway as part of the Cahill Expressway. The disused tunnels and ramp that formerly connected the station to the eastern tram tracks can still be seen from the pedestrian path along the east side of the bridge, mirroring those still in use to the west of the bridge. Station configuration Ticket barriers on the eastern side of the concourse Station concourse Wynyard station currently has two levels, each with two platforms. The upper level serves the North Shore line, whilst the lower level serves lines traversing the City Circle. Both lines run south under York Street from Wynyard to Town Hall. There is no connection between the rails of these two lines at Wynyard. The passenger concourse is on an intermediate level between the upper and lower platforms. Wynyard is connected via underground passageways to several surrounding buildings and shopping arcades and is located immediately below Wynyard Park. Direct access via tunnels is possible to George, Hunter and Pitt Streets. Escalators connect the station concourse with York Street (emerging underneath Transport House) and Carrington Street (under Wynyard Park). Refurbishment 'Interloop' sculpture 2017 Commencing in 2015, the platforms and concourse were thoroughly refurbished with new flooring and ceilings as well as an extra stairway to platforms 3 and 4 and the addition of more ticket barriers. The four wooden escalators underneath Transport House, which had been operational since the opening of the station, were replaced with modern escalators.

It is situated in Burgas Province, 20 km away from the city of Burgas and 18 km from the Sunny Beach resort. The ultrasaline lagoon Lake Pomorie, the northernmost of the Burgas Lakes, lies in the immediate proximity. The town is the administrative centre of the eponymous Pomorie Municipality. Pomorie is an ancient city and today an important tourist destination. As of December 2009, it has a population of 13,569 inhabitants.Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 It lies at . Name Centre of Pomorie Pomorie was founded by the Ancient Greeks under the name Anchialos (), deriving from Ancient Greek \\"anchi-\\" (\\"near, close to\\") and \\"als-\\" (either \\"salt\\" or a poetic and uncommon word for \\"sea\\"). In Latin, this was rendered as Anchialus. The Bulgars called the town Tuthom, though its more common name in Bulgarian was –ê–Ω—Ö–∏–∞–ª–æ, Anhialo based on the Greek name. During the Ottoman rule, the town was called Ahyolu. In 1934 the town was renamed to Pomorie, from the Bulgarian \\"po-\\" (in this context \\"by, next to\\") and \\"more\\" (\\"sea\\"), corresponding to one of the two etymologies of the original Greek name. History Ancient Greek colony and Roman centre Possibly founded in the 5th or 4th century BC as a colony of Apollonia (today Sozopol), Anchialos was mentioned in Strabo's Geographica as a small town. It was briefly captured by Messembria (Nesebar) in the 2nd century BC, but reconquered by Apollonia and its fortified walls destroyed. The western Black Sea coast was ultimately conquered by the Romans under Marcus Licinius Crassus in 29-28 BC after continuous campaigns in the area since 72-71. The fortified wall was meanwhile rebuilt, as evidenced by Ovid in 9 AD en route to Tomis. In the early 1st century AD Anchialos was the centre of a strategia of the vassal Odrysian kingdom, and the town had a Thracian population in the 6th century AD according to the early Byzantine historian Procopius. As the Odrysian kingdom's self-independence was abolished in 45 AD, Anchialos became part of the Roman province of Thrace and was formally proclaimed a city under Emperor Trajan. At the time the city controlled a vast territory bordering that of Augusta Trajana (Stara Zagora) and reaching the Tundzha to the west, bordering that of Messembria to the north and the southern shore of Lake Burgas to the south. Anchialos acquired the appearance of a Roman city and throve in the 2nd and 3rd century under the Severan Dynasty, serving as the most important import and export station of Thrace. Early Byzantine rule However, the invasion of barbarian tribes from the north meant an end to this prosperity in the middle of the 3rd century, with the Goths briefly capturing Anchialos around 270. Diocletian stayed in the city between 28 and 30 October 294. His and Constantine the Great's reforms restored the city's prosperity for a while, as the proximity to the new capital of Constantinople made Anchialos a key food supply centre. Theodoric the Great passed through the city in 476 on the way to Adrianople. A high-ranking Byzantine general named Vitalian in 513 revolted in the region and briefly took control of Anchialos and the neighbouring cities to use their fleet in his attack of Constantinople until he was crushed in 515. The bishopric of Anchialus was originally a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto, capital of the Roman province of Haemimontus. However, the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo- Epiphanius, written in the reign of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (c. 640), gives it as an autocephalous archbishopric, today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 832 The first bishop of the see whose name is known is 2nd-century Sotas, mentioned by Eusebius of Caesarea as an adversary of Montanism. Timotheus was at the Council of Sardica in 343/344. Sebastianus was one of the bishops at the First Council of Constantinople of 381. Sabbatius was a signatory of the decree of the Patriarch of Constantinople against simoniacs in 459. Paulus was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Jacobus was a contemporary of Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople. Nicolaus was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879).

Anchialos, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. II, Paris 1914, coll. 1511-1513 No longer a residential bishopric, Anchialus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 832 Pomorie's ancient Thracian tomb The Slavic and Avar invasion in 584 meant Anchialos was conquered and its fortifications were destroyed. Avar Khagan Bayan turned the city into his residence for a few months and concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines. At the eve of his campaigns, the emperor Maurice visited the city to oversee reconstruction. Byzantine and Bulgarian rule After 681 and the formation of the First Bulgarian Empire to the north Anchialos played an important role in many conflicts between the two empires. In 708 the forces of Justinian II were completely defeated near the fortress by the army of Bulgar Khan Tervel. On 30 June 763 the Bulgars under Telets suffered a defeat by the Byzantine army of Constantine V. On 21 June 766 the same emperor's fleet of 2,600 heavy ships sank en route to Anchialos, where Constantine was waiting, and most soldiers drowned, forcing him to return to Constantinople. In May 783 Irene undertook a demonstrative campaign across Thrace and restored Anchialos' destroyed fortifications. The city was first conquered by the Bulgarian Empire in 812, under Khan Krum, who settled Slavs and Bulgars in Anchialos. The Byzantines restored their control over the city and the area in 864. The Battle of Anchialus took place near the city on 20 August 917, and was one of Tsar Simeon the Great's greatest military achievements. Simeon's army routed the considerably larger Byzantine forces under Leo Phocas. Bulgaria retained the city until 971, when the Byzantine Empire reconquered it and held it for two centuries as Bulgaria was subjugated. After the restoration of the Bulgarian state Anchialos changed hands several times until it was captured by the Venetian knights of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in October 1366. The next year it was ceded to Byzantium. Ottoman rule After the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans in the 14th century, Anchialos remained a Byzantine bulwark until submission in 1453 together with Constantinople. Whilst under Ottoman administration, it became the centre of a kaza also encompassing the area around Sozopol as \\"Ahyolu\\". It was the centre of an eparchy of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and continued to act as a cultural, religious, economic and administrative centre of the region until the early 19th century, as many noble Byzantine families settled after 1453. Two Patriarchs of Constantinople stem from the city‚ÄîMichael III of Anchialus (1170‚Äì1178) and Jeremias II Tranos (1572‚Äì1579, 1580‚Äì1584, 1587‚Äì1595). Already before 1819 many prominent locals joined the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Eteria. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) a part of the town's representatives, priests as well as the Orthodox bishop Eugenios were executed by the Ottoman authorities. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 Anchialos was captured by the Russian forces on 11 July 1829 and held for a year. At the time it was mainly inhabited by Greeks, with minorities of Bulgarians and Turks, had a population of 5,000-6,000, six Orthodox churches and a mosque. After the Russian forces withdrew the whole of what is today Eastern Bulgaria gradually depopulated, with many people fleeing to the Christian lands to the north. Pomorie's St George's Monastery was founded in 1856. It was a kaza centre in ƒ∞slimye sanjak of Edirne Province before 1878 as \\"Ahyolu\\". Part of Bulgaria Anchialos was liberated from Ottoman rule on 27 January 1878 and became part of Eastern Rumelia as a kaza centre in Burgaz sanjak until Bulgaria unified in 1885. At the turn of the 20th century Anchialos was a town of about 6,000 inhabitants of which 82% were Greeks. Pomorie was one of the predominantly Greek-inhabited towns in Bulgaria that were afftected by anti-Greek pogroms in early 1900s. The local Greek community was already targeted by the Bulgarian authorities from early 1905. The town was burnt down in July, 1906, and over 300 Greeks were murdered. The perpetrators were Bulgarian refugees from the region of Macedonia as a response to the massacre of the Bulgarian inhabitants of the village of Zagorichani by Greek militants. In addition to political reasons there were also economic motives.Theodora Dragostinova, Between two motherlands : nationality and emigration among the Greeks of Bulgaria, 1900-1949. Cornell University Press, 2011. , page=44-47 The Bulgarian authorities were accused by most European governments due to this turn of events. The destruction of the town was compared by contemporary European diplomacy to the anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia. The town accommodated many Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace, mainly from around Lozengrad after World War I, who replaced the Greeks who had fled in the first decade of the 20th century; in 1906 they founded Nea Anchialos in Greece. During the 19th and 20th century it gradually lost most of its importance in the southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast at the expense of rapidly developing Burgas. It established itself as a centre of wine and salt production and was renamed Pomorie in 1934.

In this version Phaedra fights against her own sexual desires, which have been incited by Aphrodite. Phaedra agonizing over her love for Hippolytus. Ph√®dre by Alexandre Cabanel Synopsis The play is set in Troezen, a coastal town in the north-eastern Peloponnese. Theseus, the king of Athens, is serving a year's voluntary exile after having murdered a local king and his sons. His illegitimate son is Hippolytus, whose birth is the result of Theseus's rape of the Amazon Hippolyta. Hippolytus has been trained since childhood by the king of Troezen, Pittheus. At the opening of the play Aphrodite, Goddess of love, explains that Hippolytus has sworn chastity and refuses to revere her. Instead, he honours the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis. This has led her to initiate a plan of vengeance on Hippolytus. When Hippolytus went to Athens two years previously Aphrodite inspired Phaedra, Hippolytus' stepmother, to fall in love with him. Hippolytus appears with his followers and shows reverence to a statue of Artemis, a chaste goddess. A servant warns him about slighting Aphrodite, but Hippolytus refuses to listen. The chorus, consisting of young married women of Troezen, enters and describes how Theseus's wife, Phaedra has not eaten or slept in three days. Phaedra, sickly, appears with her nurse. After an agonizing discussion, Phaedra finally confesses why she is ill: she loves Hippolytus. The nurse and the chorus are shocked. Phaedra explains that she must starve herself and die with her honour intact. However, the nurse quickly retracts her initial response and tells Phaedra that she has a magical charm to cure her. However, in an aside she reveals different plans. The nurse, after making Hippolytus swear not to tell anyone, informs Hippolytus of Phaedra's desire and suggests that Hippolytus consider yielding to her. He reacts with a furious tirade and threatens to tell his father, Theseus, everything as soon as he arrives. Phaedra realizes disaster has fallen. After making the chorus swear secrecy, she goes inside and hangs herself. Theseus returns and discovers his wife's dead body. Because the chorus is sworn to secrecy, they cannot tell Theseus why she killed herself. Theseus discovers a letter on Phaedra's body, which falsely asserts that she was raped by Hippolytus. Enraged, Theseus curses his son either to death or at least exile. To execute the curse, Theseus calls upon his father, the god Poseidon, who has promised to grant his son three wishes. Hippolytus enters and protests his innocence but cannot tell the truth because of the binding oath that he swore. Taking his wife's letter as proof, Theseus exiles his son. The chorus sings a lament for Hippolytus. A messenger enters and describes a gruesome scene to Theseus; as Hippolytus got in his chariot to leave the kingdom, a bull roared out of the sea, frightening his horses, which dashed his chariot among the rocks, dragging Hippolytus behind. Hippolytus seems to be dying. The messenger protests Hippolytus' innocence, but Theseus refuses to believe him. Theseus is glad that Hippolytus is suffering and about to die. But then the goddess, Artemis, appears and rages at Theseus for killing his own son; she brutally tells him the truth: there was no rape, Phaedra had lied, his son was innocent. Theseus is painfully devastated by this revelation. Hippolytus is carried in physically battered and barely clinging to life. In the last moments of the play, Hippolytus forgives his father, kind words are exchanged between father and son, and then Hippolytus dies. Interpretations In this play, all characters, the humans and gods, have imperfections and can be jealous and brutal in vengeance. They all have blindnesses that keep them from seeing and understanding others with empathy and these blindnesses result in tragedy. The play presents two goddesses who represent two aspects of the human spirit in conflict: One aspect is love, represented by Aphrodite and personified by Phaedra. The second aspect is what the play refers to as sophrosyne, which is represented by Artemis and personified by Hippolytus. Sophrosyne can be defined in part as being chaste, pure, clear-headed and untainted by sexual desire. Texts *Barrett, W. S.

Targa top, or targa for short, is a semi-convertible car body style with a removable roof section and a full width roll bar behind the seats. The term was first used on the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa, and it remains a registered trademark of Porsche AG. The rear window is normally fixed, but on some targa models, it is removable or foldable, making it a convertible-type vehicle. Any piece of normally fixed metal or trim which rises up from one side, over the roof and down the other side is sometimes called a targa band, targa bar, or a wrapover band. Targa tops are different from T-tops, which have a solid, non- removable bar running between the top of the windscreen and the rear roll-bar, and generally have two separate roof panels above the seats that fit between the window and central t-bar.  Origin  The word targa first came into use from the 1965 Porsche 911 Targa, though it was not the first to use the removable roof panel system. The system first appeared in 1957 on the limited- production Fiat 1200 ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äù by Vignale, designed by Giovanni Michelotti. The later Triumph TR4 from 1961, another Michelotti design, also featured a similar system, defined by Triumph as a surrey top. The 1964 SAAB Catherina prototype and the 1965 Toyota Sports 800 both used similar systems before the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa. The targa style roof opening became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were fears that the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the United States would ban convertibles, due to concerns over the safety of occupants when a car overturns. As a result, manufacturers adopted Targa tops or T-tops. As Porsche helped to popularise this body style, they took out a trademark for the Targa name and manufacturers sought for alternative names for their removable tops. Porsche got the name \\"Targa\\" from the Targa Florio, the road race in Sicily where Porsche was very successful. Targa means \\"plate\\" in Italian. Targa and T-top numbers have slowly declined as manufacturers discontinued them in favour of full convertibles with retractable hardtops and folding metal roofs such as the Mercedes-Benz SLK, and by better structural engineering with pop-up roll over bars behind the seats and front roll-over bar incorporated into the front windscreen, File:\\" 13 - ITALY - Vettura Targa - Targa top - Targadach - Fiat X19.svgTarga top body style (Fiat X1/9 example) File:TR 250 Valencia Blue.jpgTriumph TR250 Surrey Top.  Glass roof  1996 saw the debut of a retractable glass roof in the Porsche 993 Targa, a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The glass roof retracted underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. A shade was there to help prevent the greenhouse effect of the closed roof. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new glass roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain nearly the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and eliminated the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa had the body of the Cabriolet with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof. The 911 Targa continued with the all-new 996-model and gained a lifting hatchback glass window. This, in turn, was used on the later 997 model of 911.  Motorized roof  With the introduction and production of the latest 911, the Type 991, Porsche decided to take the latest Targa in a different direction from that of the previous water-cooled Type 996/997 cars. The latest Targa was introduced in 2014 and unlike the Type 993/996/997 Targas, the new car has somewhat returned to its earliest Targa roots by the utilizing of a solid roof panel spanning over the front seats. However unlike the manual lift-out panels of earlier 911s, the Type 991 Targa's roof panel is mechanized for automated lift-away and storage under the rear glass roof, which itself is mechanized to lift up and out of the way as the roof panel is placed into its stowed position. The Type 991 Targa also brings back the styling feature of the 'Targa bar' that was perhaps the most obvious and overt design cue of the air-cooled generation Targas. But unlike the previous Targa hoops, the one used on the Type 991 is in sections, where the horizontal span member is a physically separate piece that itself is mechanized to lift off of its vertical supports in order to allow the solid roof panel and its motorized components to slide rearwards as the panel is being stored within the car.  Rotating roof  Ferrari introduced a hybrid variation of the targa roof and folding metal roof with the 180 degree rotating roof featured on the 2005 Ferrari 575M Maranello Superamerica. The concept was also used in the 2010 Renault Wind.

The Shamrock Summit was the colloquial name given to the 18 March 1985 meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and US President Ronald Reagan in Quebec City. It gained this nickname because of the Irish background of the two leaders and because the meeting was held the day after St. Patrick's Day. The summit was capped by a televised gala, which ended with Mulroney, Reagan and their wives singing When Irish Eyes are Smiling, which publicly exemplified the camaraderie between the two leaders.

Background Mulroney enjoyed a close friendship with Reagan at the time; both men considered themselves conservatives politically, and shared a common agenda on many issues, notably free trade.

Life  Felix von Hartmann was born in M√ºnster, the child of the second marriage of government official Albert von Hartmann. The family was close to the Westphalian aristocracy and served in a manner similar to the traditional Prussian public servants. After finishing his courses at Gymnasium Paulinum in Westphalia, he attended the Roman Catholic boarding school Collegium Augustinianum Gaesdonck, where Hermann Dingelstad, later Bishop of M√ºnster, was his teacher. In 1870, he enrolled in a theological school in Westphalia, and on 19 December 1874, he was ordained a priest. Because the \\"Kulturkampf\\" (\\"culture war\\") made employment in Germany impossible, he went to Rome, where he became Chaplain of S. Maria dell'Anima, the German church in Rome, and simultaneously started his study of Canon law. In 1877 he earned the title of Dr. jur. can. (doctor of canon law) and returned to Westphalia in 1879, where he became chaplain in the parishes of Havixbeck and Emmerich. In 1890, he became secretary and chaplain to Dingelstad, by this time Bishop of M√ºnster. He rose through the ranks of the Church, serving as counselor of the episcopal curia of M√ºnich, 1895‚Äì1905; canon of the cathedral chapter of M√ºnster, 1903‚Äì1905; vicar general of M√ºnster, 30 October 1905‚Äì1911; dean of the chapter and vicar capitular, 1910; and protonotary apostolic ad instar participantium, 20 December 1907. He was prepared, on the basis of royal nomination, to be promoted to the episcopate of M√ºnster, where he was promoted to dean in 1911. Having great influence on church politics, because the Bishop trusted him completely, he had a certain view concerning the reformation of Catholicism, which even later he never gave up. Because his influence was well known, his election to the bishopric of M√ºnster on 6 June 1911 surprised no one. Despite the royal government's disapproval of his ultramontane views it was impressed by his wise and polite ways, his excellent manners as well as his noble descent. His papal confirmation followed on 27 July and his ordination as bishop by the archbishop of Cologne, Anton Fischer, on 26 October in M√ºnster. On 29 October 1912, von Hartmann was selected as archbishop of Cologne and was enthroned on 19 April 1913. On 2 May 1914, Pope Pius X made him a Cardinal. From 1914 until his death, he was the leader of the Conference of German Bishops in Fulda. When he arrived in Cologne at the height of the trade union strike, his main concern were the Catholic workers' organizations. In this issue he succeeded in assuming a flexible attitude and starting in 1913, he also openly endorsed the interdenominational trade unions. Whereas he found support for his stance in Cologne and some other places many others considered his opinion to be a stab in the back. Cardinal Kopp even tried to block his creation as Cardinal because of this. Often, and certainly accurately, described as patriotic and loyal to the monarchy, those around him always saw him as a political conservative, given which his restraint with reference to the Centre Party is self-explanatory. In addition, he did not support the abolition of the \\"Dreiklassenwahlrecht\\", a system which allocated voting rights according to how much tax one paid, because he feared that is would benefit the Social Democrats (SPD). He was convinced of the legitimacy of World War I, and in 1915 went to Rome personally to explain the German government's view on the Belgian question. The risk-averse and conflict-shy Hartmann sought in this manner to escape at any price from the Belgian Cardinal Mercier. When Mercier asked the German episcopate in 1916 to acquit the Belgian population from the reproach of partisan warfare, Hartmann could barely be hindered to make a public statement in response, which would have drawn the episcopate into the nationalist polemic debate. In general Felix von Hartmann cared for the cure of souls, for prisoners of war and for mercy for many foreigners that were sentenced by German war tribunals. Therefore, he travelled to the Western Front in the summer of 1916 and continued to maintain good contacts with Kaiser Wilhelm II even after the fall of the German Empire. In mid-September 1919 Hartmann became ill with shingles on the left side of his head, which led rapidly to the paralysis of the left half of his face. At the beginning of November he contracted pneumonia as well, which led to his death in the early morning hours of 11 November 1919 in Cologne, Germany. Hartmann is buried in the metropolitan cathedral of Cologne.

It was probably written to aid missionaries in explaining the Christian religion to and defending it against dissenting points of doctrine in Islam and Judaism. To this end, Aquinas could rely on a substantial body of shared doctrine, especially tenets of monotheism, in the case of Judaism the shared acceptance of the Old Testament as scripture and in the case of Islam the (at the time) shared tradition of Aristotelian philosophy. Whereas the Summa Theologi√¶ was written to explain the Christian faith to theology students, the Summa contra Gentiles is more apologetic in tone, as it was written to explain and defend the Christian doctrine against unbelievers, with arguments adapted to fit the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain heretical belief or proposition. Instead of a mere elucidation of the length and breadth of Christian doctrine, Aquinas explains specific core articles of Christian belief.  Title  The conventional title Summa contra Gentiles, found in some of the earliest manuscripts, is sometimes given in the variant Summa contra Gentes. The title is taken from chapter I.2, where Thomas states his intention as the work's author: > I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my limited powers will > allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of setting aside the > errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of Hilary: 'I am aware that > I owe this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense > may speak of Him' (De Trinitate I, 37).trans. Pegis (1955) A longer title is also given as Tractatus de fide catholica, contra Gentiles (or: contra errores infidelium), meaning \\"Tractate on the universal faith, against the pagans\\" (or, against the errors of the unbelievers). This is often shortened to De fide Catolica. Date and composition The work was written over a period of several years, between 1259 and 1265. In the spring of 1256 Thomas was appointed regent master in theology at Paris and one of his first works upon assuming this office was Contra impugnantes Dei cultum et religionem, defending the mendicant orders, which had come under attack by William of Saint-Amour. During his tenure from 1256 to 1259, Thomas wrote numerous works, and he was working on Summa contra Gentiles by the time he left Paris.Davies, Aquinas: An Introduction, p. 4. From Aquinas's autograph, Torrell (1996) identified the first 53 chapters of Book I as having been written in Paris based on studies of the parchment and the ink used. According to a tradition that can be traced to shortly after Thomas's death, the Summa contra Gentiles was written in response to a request, made in 1259, for a book that would help the Dominican missionaries in Spain to convert the Muslims and Jews there. The request was made by Raymond of Pe√±afort, a Dominican friar and advisor to James I of Aragon.John Y.B. Hood, Aquinas and the Jews (1995), p. 37. Raymond had been active in the Christian defense against the Moors (Muslims) and Jews in the kingdom of Aragon since the 1240s. To this end, Raymond instituted the teaching of Arabic and Hebrew in several houses of the friars, and he also founded priories in Murcia (then still under Muslim rule) and in Tunis. Additionally he went to help establish the Church in the recently conquered island of Mallorca. Raymond's request to Thomas was transmitted by fellow Dominican Ram√≥n Mart√≠, one of eight friars appointed to make a study of oriental languages with the purpose of carrying on a mission to Jews and Moors.Anthony Bonner, Doctor illuminatus, Princeton University Press (1993), p. 78 The historicity of this account has been questioned in modern scholarship.Brian Davies, Thomas Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles: A Guide and Commentary, Oxford University Press, (2016), pages 8-10. Arguments adduced include the lack of an explicit dedication to Raymond, the evidence that substantial portions of book 1 were complete by mid-1259 (suggesting that Thomas started work on the book as early as 1257), and the suggestion that the work makes no effort to address tenets of Islam specifically.\\"Aquinas only mentions Islam nine times in the entire work, and only a brief paragraph (1.6) says anything remotely substantive about the religion.\\" T. E. Burman in: Nicholas of Cusa and Islam: Polemic and Dialogue in the Late Middle Ages, Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions (Ian Christopher Levy, Rita George-Tvrtkoviƒá, Donald Duclow eds.), BRILL (2014), p. xv. Later in 1259, Thomas left Paris and returned to Naples, where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to Orvieto as conventual lector responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a studium generale. It was in Orvieto that Thomas completed Summa contra Gentiles, which was followed by the Catena aureaHealy, Theologian, p. 4. and minor works produced for Pope Urban IV such as the liturgy for the newly created feast of Corpus Christi and the Contra errores graecorum. Parts of the text have survived in Aquinas's autograph, kept in the Vatican Library as Lat. 9850. The manuscript includes fragments of books one and two, and large portions of book three. Contents The Summa contra Gentiles consists of four books. The structure of Thomas's work is designed to proceed from general philosophical arguments for monotheism, to which Muslims and Jews are likely to consent even within their own respective religious traditions, before progressing to the discussion of specifically Christian doctrine. * Book I begins with general questions of truth and natural reason, and from chapter 10 investigates the concept of monotheistic God, chapters 10 to 13 concerned with the existence of God, followed by a detailed investigation of God's properties (chapters 14 to 102). * Book II is dedicated to the Creation (viz. the physical universe, everything which exists). * Book III discusses providence and the human condition, i.e. good and evil acts, human fate and intellect and the relation of created beings to the creator. * Book IV is dedicated to discussing points of Christian doctrine which separate Nicaean Christianity from the other monotheistic religions, i.e. the doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Sacraments and the Resurrection. Books I‚ÄìIII cover truths that naturally are accessible to the human intellect while Book IV covers revealed truths for which natural reason is inadequate.

The date of composition is unknown, but he probably worked on it periodically between 1911 and 1928. Intended to be a spatial composition for two or more orchestras, it is in three sections: Ives conceived the idea during the autumn of 1915 while he was staying in the Adirondacks of New York State, but he left it alone until 1923, when he returned to working on it. Although he spent many years on it, many of the sketches are missing. During the 1990s there were three separate performing versions assembled, including a version by David Gray Porter (1993, Section A plus the Coda and part of a first Prelude only), Larry Austin (1994), and Johnny Reinhard (1996). It is a complex work, using 20 independent musical lines; each moves in a separate meter, only coinciding on downbeats eight seconds apart. According to his notes on a sketch of the Universe Symphony, Ives was \\"striving to ... paint the creation, the mysterious beginnings of all things known through God and man, to trace with tonal imprints the vastness, the evolution of all life, in nature, of humanity from the great roots of life to the spiritual eternities, from the great inknown to the great unknown.\\" Ives envisioned the work being performed by multiple orchestras located in valleys, on hillsides and mountains, with the music mimicking \\"the eternal pulse ... the planetary motion of the earth ... the soaring lines of mountains and cliffs ... deep ravines, sharp jagged edges of rock\\". Pages are missing or were never written. The first part (\\"Section A\\") was derived from a sketch of 1915 for a piece called \\"The Earth and the Heavens\\" or \\"The Earth and the Firmament\\", with one group of instruments representing the Earth and another group representing the Heavens, and with a group of percussion instruments representing the eternal pulse of the universe underlying both. This is the most complete large fragment of the piece, along with a Coda for the complete movement written in a similar style that shares the same four main \\"Earth- themes\\" of Section A. The main \\"sky-theme\\" is the only theme built upon a quotation, the hymn tune \\"Bethany\\" (\\"Nearer My God to Thee\\", the same hymn tune used as the basis for the Finale of his Fourth Symphony.) There were also to be three Preludes to the Symphony, but none were completed. The most complete is the first Prelude, but again this was not completed, left only in the form of an outline-sketch with musical examples. For more information see James B.

The station forms an artificial island in the West India Docks (North Dock). The five upper levels of the station are a mixed-use development known as Crossrail Place. It will be on the Abbey Wood branch of the Crossrail route between and Custom House. Construction began in May 2009, and it is expected to start receiving passenger rail services in 2021. During the project's development the station was named Isle of Dogs, before the current name was adopted. Construction will cost an estimated ¬£500 million to complete. The station will be one of the largest on the Crossrail route when it opens, providing Canary Wharf estate with a connection to the National Rail network and additionally an interchange with Canary Wharf station on the London Underground and Poplar DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway. Design and construction The station is located beneath and within the West India North Dock on an artificial island.Route Window C11: Isle of Dogs station Crossrail Retrieved 1 November 2008 The station will extend from east of the Docklands Light Railway bridge to the east end of the dock. It stands within a long concrete box with a long island platform. It is fitted out to with the potential for extension should the need to operate longer trains arise. A long scissor crossover at the western end of the station will enable trains to either terminate at Canary Wharf and turn back towards central London, or to continue to the terminus at . Original design The main access point for the Crossrail station was to be the rebuilt Great Wharf Bridge. From this entrance there would have been a set of escalators to the concourse level, which will be located underwater. Another bank of escalators would take passengers to the platforms. Construction of the station was to predominantly take place on Hertsmere Road, which runs parallel to the West India North Dock. This would have involved digging a wide shaft to the station depth of below the dock water-level to enable crew and equipment to begin boring the box that would form the station. The construction including fit-out and commissioning of the Hertsmere Road shaft was expected to take approximately four years whilst the same would take five years for the station. Redesign and construction In December 2008 an extra ¬£150 million of funding from the Canary Wharf Group was announced for the station. Work was due to commence in January 2009. As part of the deal Canary Wharf Group substantially redesigned the station, incorporating a large shopping centre and a park above the platforms situated in the middle of the dock. A groundbreaking ceremony for the station was held on 15 May 2009. Throughout 2009 the main focus was on installing 293 interlocking steel piles high and wide into the dock floor using ten-storey high piling cranes and Giken piling machines to form a cofferdam. As part of this, deep reinforced concrete piles were placed through each of the 293 tubes. On 11 February 2010 Sadiq Khan, then Transport Minister, activated pumps designed to drain nearly 100 million litres () from the work site over the following six weeks. The pumps transferred water from inside the site's specially constructed cofferdam to the North Dock at a maximum rate of per minute. A station 'box' was constructed in a dry environment in a similar technique to that used in the construction of the nearby Canary Wharf Underground station. Crossrail Place is the structure above the platforms and was partly opened on 1 May 2015. In September 2015, the station construction was completed and the focus has shifted to fitting the station screen doors, ticket machines and other things before the station is scheduled for opening. Ownership While TfL Rail will operate services and manage the station as a train operating company and will form a part of National Rail, all infrastructure will be owned and maintained by Transport for London and not by Network Rail.

It is down the line from . Train services from the station are operated by Southeastern and Thameslink. Southeastern also manages the station. Dartford is a major interchange station in the North Kent region of the Southeastern network. Ticket barriers control access to the platforms. The station is where three lines from London meet: * the North Kent Line, via Woolwich Arsenal * the Bexleyheath Line * the Dartford Loop Line via Sidcup. Westbound services normally terminate at London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street (both via London Bridge), London Victoria and, for Thameslink trains, Luton and Bedford. Services from London also continue through Dartford to Greenhithe (for Bluewater) to terminate at Gravesend, Strood, Rochester or Gillingham. Thameslink trains terminate at Rainham. Many of the terminating services at Dartford form London bound services, but the remainder will be stabled and maintained at Slade Green Depot approximately two miles west on the North Kent Line. There are several sidings to the east of the station where terminating trains can be stabled until such time as needed to return to Dartford to form London bound services or until drivers are available to return the train to Slade Green Depot.  History  The first station was opened here by the South Eastern Railway it extended its North Kent Line from Gravesend on 30 July 1849, taking the line from there to London. The original station building had an Italianate design; this was replaced by a glass and metal ticket office complex in 1972. A footbridge leads across the line to the two island platforms. Replacement of the 1972 station building was approved in 2011, with enabling works started late that year, and major works commenced in mid-2012. The new building was completed in November 2013. Future development In the future, Dartford station may form part of a Crossrail extension line, linking to Canary Wharf, London Paddington station, Heathrow Airport and Reading. Trivia In 1960, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards met by chance at the station, going on to be the core writing team of the Rolling Stones. There is a plaque on the London-bound platform to commemorate this fact.Victor Bockris, Keith Richards: The Unauthorised Biography - Page 21, 2002, Omnibus Press, Christopher Sandford, Keith Richards: Satisfaction - Page 174, 2004, Carroll & Graf Publishers, Dartford railway station gained a lot of attention due to the high numbers of people travelling using this line, mistakenly not knowing that Oyster cards were not valid, and there was evidence of being approached by staff and receiving penalty fares.

Subtext is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext has been used historically to imply controversial subjects without drawing the attention, or wrath, of censors. This has been especially true in comedy, but it is also common in science fiction, where it can be easier and safer to make social critiques if it is set in a time other than the (author's) present. Definition Subtext is content \\"under\\", and hence, \\"sub\\", or hidden beneath, the actual dialog or text. To gather subtext the audience must \\"read between the lines\\". This is crucial to a clear and accurate understanding of the word. If it is stated explicitly, it is by definition not subtext, because it is no longer hidden. In fact, writers are often criticized for the failure to artfully create and use subtext. Such writing is faulted for being too \\"on the nose\\", meaning the characters always mean what they actually say. Among other things, this robs the text of dramatic tension and can make the whole thing too boring and obvious. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to the desire to appeal to a general audience. Examples are sexual or other adult references in a story nominally marketed to children. Their inclusion sails right over the kid's heads but the adults appreciate a chuckling nod to the fact that they too are in the audience. Subtext is not costumes, set pieces, or design, although these cultural cues may 'set the table' for the understanding and interpretation of the subtext.

A chapel of ease (or chapel-of-ease) is a church building other than the parish church, built within the bounds of a parish for the attendance of those who cannot reach the parish church conveniently. Overview Often a chapel of ease is deliberately built as such, being more accessible to some parishioners than the main church. Such a chapel may exist, for example, when a parish covers several dispersed villages, or a central village together with its satellite hamlet or hamlets. In such a case the parish church will be in the main settlement, with one or more chapels of ease in the subordinate village(s) and/or hamlet(s). An example is the chapel belonging to All Hallows' Parish in Maryland, USA; the chapel was built in Davidsonville from 1860 to 1865 because the parish's \\"Brick Church\\" in South River was too far away at distant. A more extreme example is the Chapel-of-Ease built in 1818 on St. David's Island in Bermuda to spare St. David's Islanders crossing St. George's Harbour to reach the parish church, St. Peter's, on St. George's Island.Anglican Church of Bermuda. Where to Worship. OUR CHURCHES: St. George's ParishBermuda Online: Bermuda's St. David's Island. In St. George's Parish but with a unique flavour and character: St. David's Chapel of Ease Some chapels of ease are buildings which used to be the main parish church until a larger building was constructed for that purpose. For example, the small village of Norton, Hertfordshire, contains the mediaeval church of St Nicholas, which served it adequately for centuries; but when the large new town of Letchworth was built, partly within the parish, St Nicholas's became too small to serve the increased population. This led to the building of a new main church building for the parish, and St Nicholas's became a chapel of ease. Chapels of ease are sometimes associated with large manor houses, where they provide a convenient place of worship for the family of the manor, and for the domestic and rural staff of the house and the estate. There are many such chapels in England, for example that at Pedlinge in Kent. An example in the New World is Saint John's Chapel of Ease in Chamcook, New Brunswick, Canada, which was built in the 1840s to support a gentleman's house and the small settlement of shipbuilders, farmers, and grist-mill nearby. Sometimes an ancient parish church is reduced in status to a chapel of ease due to a shift of population. An example is the churches of St Mary Wiston and All Saints' at Buncton in West Sussex. For centuries St Mary's was the parish church (located near to Wiston House and therefore the centre of population), whilst All Saints' served the nearby hamlet of Buncton, as a chapel of ease. Today, however, the resident population of Wiston is tiny, whilst Buncton has grown, so that in 2007 the status of the buildings was reversed, with All Saints' becoming the parish church, and St Mary's reduced to a chapel of ease. When two or more existing parishes are combined into a single parish, one or more of the old church buildings may be kept as a chapel of ease. For example, the six Roman Catholic parishes in Palo Alto, California, were combined into a single parish, St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in 1987. Since then, St. Thomas Aquinas Church serves as the parish church, with Our Lady of the Rosary Church and St. Albert the Great Church as chapels of ease. When a parish is split because of expanding population a chapel of ease may be promoted to a full parish church. An example of this is St. Margaret's Church, Rochester in Kent which started as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Nicholas in 1108, became a parish church in 1488 then reverted to a chapel of ease when the parish was recombined with St Peter's in 1953.

The phrase death certificate can refer either to a legal document issued by a medical practitioner and signed by a doctor which states the time, month, hour, cause, minute, year, and day of a person‚Äôs death or of a person‚Äôs or, popularly, to a document issued by a person such as a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location and cause of a person's death as later entered in an official register of deaths. Nature of a certificate Death Certificate Rev. 1945 issued on April 5, 1948 Before issuing a death certificate, the authorities usually require a certificate from a physician or coroner to validate the cause of death and the identity of the deceased. In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead (usually because their body is being sustained by life support), a neurologist is often called in to verify brain death and to fill out the appropriate documentation. The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government (to trigger issuance of the death certificate) is often both a crime and cause for loss of one's license to practice. This is because of past scandals in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or voted in elections. A full explanation of the cause of death includes any other diseases and disorders the person had at the time of death, even though they did not directly cause the death. Public documents In most of the United States, death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester's relationship to the deceased. Other jurisdictions take a different view, and restrict the issue of certificates. For example, in the State of New York, death certificates are only obtainable by close relatives, including the spouse, parent, child or sibling of the deceased, and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim, documented medical need, or a New York State Court Order. History In Europe and North America, death records were kept by the local churches, along with baptism and marriage records. In what would become the United States, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first to have the secular courts keep these records, in 1639. By the end of the 19th century, European countries were pursuing centralized systems for recording deaths. In the United States, a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910. Specific jurisdictions  Scotland  National registration began in 1855; registrations are rather more detailed. Stillbirths United States A 2007 article in People magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a birth certificate and a death certificate.

Under Scots law, a criminal trial may end in one of three verdicts: one of conviction (\\"guilty\\") and two of acquittal (\\"not proven\\" and \\"not guilty\\").The Scottish criminal jury: A very peculiar institution, Peter Duff, 62 Law & Contemp. Probs. 173 (Spring 1999) Between the Restoration in the late 17th century and the early 18th century, jurors in Scotland were expected only to find whether individual factual allegations were proven or not proven, rather than to rule on an accused's guilt. In 1728, the jury in a murder trial asserted \\"its ancient right\\" to declare a defendant \\"not guilty\\". Over time, the \\"not guilty\\" verdict regained wide acceptance and use amongst Scots juries, with the encouragement of defence lawyers. It eventually displaced \\"not proven\\" as the primary verdict of acquittal. Nowadays, juries can return a verdict of either \\"not guilty\\" or \\"not proven\\", with the same legal effect of acquittal. Out of the country, the \\"not proven\\" verdict may be referred to as the Scottish verdict, and in Scotland itself it may be referred to colloquially as the bastard verdict, which was a term coined by Sir Walter Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk. History By the early 17th century, the standard practice of juries in Scotland was to return a finding of \\"fylet, culpable and convict\\" or \\"clene, innocent and acquit\\". This changed in the late 17th century, at which point the role of the jury became simply to \\"declare whether or not the facts alleged had been proved\\", with the judge left to determine, based on that declaration, whether the accused was guilty or not. There is some disagreement between historians as to why this change happened. David Hume and Hugo Arnot argue that it was rooted in religious oppression. The Crown persecuted the Covenanters but popular support made it impossible to convict them in a jury trial. To pare the power of the jury, the Scottish judges began restricting the jury's role: no longer would the jury announce whether the accused was \\"guilty\\" or \\"not guilty\\"; instead it would decide whether specific factual allegations were \\"proven\\" or \\"not proven\\"; and the judge would then decide whether to convict. Reintroduction of \\"not guilty\\" In a notable trial in 1728, a defence lawyer (Robert Dundas) persuaded a jury to reassert its ancient right of acquitting, of finding an accused \\"not guilty\\", in spite of the facts being proven. The case involved the trial of Carnegie of Finhaven for the murder of the Earl of Strathmore. The law required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of \\"proven\\" or \\"not proven\\" depending on whether they believed the evidence proved that the accused had killed the Earl. Carnegie had undoubtedly killed the Earl, but had also clearly not intended to do so. If the jury brought in a \\"proven\\" verdict they would in effect constrain the judge to find Carnegie guilty of murder, for which the punishment was hanging. To avert this outcome, the jury asserted what it believed to be their \\"ancient right\\" to judge the whole case and not just the facts, and brought in the verdict of \\"not guilty\\". The reintroduction of the \\"not guilty\\" verdict was part of a wider movement during the 17th and 18th century which saw a gradual increase in the power of juries, such as the trial of William Penn in 1670, in which an English jury first gained the right to pass a verdict contrary to the law (known as jury nullification), and the trial of John Peter Zenger in New York in 1735 in which jury nullification is credited with establishing freedom of the press as firm right in what would become the United States. Legal academic Ian Willock argues that the 1728 case was \\"of great significance in calling a halt to a process of attrition which might have led to the total extinction of the criminal jury\\". Although jurors continued to use both \\"not guilty\\" and \\"not proven\\" after 1728, jurors tended to favour the \\"not guilty\\" verdict over the \\"not proven\\" and the interpretation changed. Calls for reform There have been consistent calls to scrap the \\"not proven\\" verdict since the middle of the 20th century. In 1975, the Thomson Committee on Criminal Procedure in Scotland (chaired by Lord Thomson) recommended retaining the three-verdict system. The Scottish Office consulted on scrapping \\"not proven\\" in 1994. Unsuccessful attempts to scrap the \\"not proven\\" verdict were made in Parliament by Donald Dewar in 1969, George Robertson in 1993 (prompted by the trial outcome in the murder of Amanda Duffy) and Lord Macauly of Bragar in 1995. A members' bill to scrap the \\"not proven\\" verdict was debated in the Scottish Parliament in 2016, but was rejected by 80 votes to 28. Proponents of reform argue that the \\"not proven\\" verdict is widely regarded as an acquittal used when the judge or jury does not have enough evidence to convict but is not sufficiently convinced of the accused person's innocence to bring in a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Essentially, the judge or jury is unconvinced that the suspect is innocent, but guilt has not been proven \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\". Conversely, its opponents argue that a two-verdict system would lead to an increase in wrongful convictions. Following a not proven verdict in a criminal trial in 2015, Miss M successfully sued Stephen Coxen in the civil courts, in what was the first civil damages action for rape following an unsuccessful criminal prosecution in almost 100 years. In 2018 Miss M launched #EndNotProven alongside Rape Crisis Scotland, calling for Not Proven to be removed and citing the disproportionate use in rape cases, the widespread misunderstandings of the verdict and fears that it is being used as an 'easy way out' by jurors. Modern usage In Scotland, a criminal case may be decided either in solemn procedure by a jury (instructed by the judge), or in summary procedure by the judge alone (with no jury appointed). There are various rules for when the one or the other procedure may or must be employed; in general, juries are employed for the more severe accusations, while petty crimes and offences are treated summarily. A criminal case jury consists of fifteen jurors, who make their decision by a simple majority vote: eight votes are necessary and sufficient for the verdict guilty, which has replaced the verdict proven. Approximately one-third of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries use the formulation not proven; the others use not guilty. The verdict not proven also is available for judges in the summary procedure, and is employed in about a fifth of the \\"summary\\" acquittals. The proportion of not proven acquittals, in general, is higher in the more severe cases; but so then are the proportion of acquittals versus convictions. This might have many different reasons, e.g. that on average it might be factually more complicated to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the more severe cases. Both in the \\"solemn\\" and the \\"summary\\" acquittals, not proven is interpreted as indicating that the jury or judge, respectively, is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be morally convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find the proofs sufficient for a conviction. One reason for this is the rule that in such cases the evidence for the prosecution must be corroborated in order to permit a conviction. Thus, there might be a single plaintiff or witness for the prosecution, which the jury or judge believes is both truthful and trustworthy, but no other witness or circumstances against the accused. By Scottish law, the accused then should be acquitted, but often will be so by the verdict not proven. Use in other jurisdictions Since 1989, in the Italian juridical system, there are five modes of acquittal available. Two of these correspond roughly to the Scottish not guilty and not proven, respectively.Quoted from The New Italian Code of Criminal Procedure: The Difficulties of Building an Adversarial Trial System on a Civil Law Foundation by William T. Pizzi and Luca Marafioti, Yale J Intl L 1,2,15 (1992), page 7; the reference found in Comment: Not proven: Introducing a third verdict by Samuel Bray, The University of Chicago law review 72 (2005), pp. 1299-1329 In general, the Scottish verdict has not been permanently adopted outside its home country, but it was sometimes used in colonial Canada, especially by some judges in southwestern Ontario. Its most famous use in the United States came when Senator Arlen Specter tried to vote \\"not proven\\" on the two articles of impeachment of Bill Clinton, his votes were recorded as \\"not guilty\\" and when, at the O.J. Simpson murder case, various reformers, including Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman's father, pushed for a change to \\"not proven\\" because of what they felt was an incorrect presumption of innocence on the part of Simpson. The verdict is often referenced in US cases where the jury is obliged to find the state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but there is widespread feeling that the defendant does not deserve the exoneration of a ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô verdict. A popular saying about the ‚Äònot proven‚Äô verdict is that it means ‚Äònot guilty, but don‚Äôt do it again‚Äô. In 2005, a proposal was made in the University of Chicago Law Review to introduce the not proven verdict into the United States.

It is used by political scientists, such as Joseph Nye, to describe \\"attempts to understand all the interconnections of the modern world‚Äîand to highlight patterns that underlie (and explain) them.\\" While primarily associated with world-systems, it can be used to describe other global trends. The term is also used by opponents of globalization such as populist movements. The term is similar to internationalism and cosmopolitanism.  Political science definitions  Paul James defines globalism \\"at least in its more specific use [...] as the dominant ideology and subjectivity associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the Roman Empire in the second century AD, and perhaps to the Greeks of the fifth-century BC.\\". Manfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.. Market globalism includes the ideology of neoliberalism. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World, Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways. Alternatively, American political scientist Joseph Nye, co- founder of the international relations theory of neoliberalism, generalized the term to argue that globalism refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by networks of connections that span multi- continental distances; while globalization refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.. This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization. The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e., whether globalization is unprecedented or not). It has been used to describe international endeavours begun after World War II, such as the United Nations, the Warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, and sometimes the later neoliberal and neoconservative policies of \\"nation building\\" and military interventionism between the end of the Cold War in 1991 and the beginning of the War on Terror in 2001.  Arguments in favor  Proponents of globalism believe in global citizenship; that is, the problems of humanity can be resolved with democratic globalism. Democratic globalism is the idea that all people matter, no matter where they live, and that universal freedom and human rights can be fostered for all mankind. World citizens believe in civic globalism and that by thinking globally and acting locally they can affect positive change across all barriers.  Arguments against  Arguments against globalism are similar to those moved against globalisation, among which loss of cultural identity, deletion of community history, conflict of civilization, loss of political representation and collapse of the democratic process in favour of a globally managed open society. However, the term \\"globalist\\" has also been used as a pejorative for political enemies, on the left within the context of the 1990s anti-globalization movement and protests, and on the right as a pejorative of \\"cosmopolitans\\" or those who favor internationalist projects over national ones. For example, during the election and presidency of United States president Donald Trump, he and members of his administration used the term globalist on multiple occasions. The administration was accused of using the term as an anti-Semitic \\"dog whistle\\", to associate their critics with a Jewish conspiracy.  History of the concept  The term first came into widespread usage in the United States. Compare this with globalism in the British-English corpus, where its appearance is later and much more muted. The modern concept of globalism arose in the post-war debates of the 1940s in the United States. In their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States. This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history.. As George Kennan's Policy Planning Staff put it in February 1948: \\"[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. [‚Ä¶] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity\\".. America's allies and foes in Eurasia were still recovering from World War II at this time. American historian James Peck has described this version of globalism as \\"visionary globalism\\". Per Peck, this was a far-reaching conception of \\"American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking\\". This included global economic integration, which had collapsed under World War I and the Great Depression.() Modern globalism has been linked to the ideas of economic and political integration of countries and economies. The first person in the United States to use the term \\"economic integration\\" in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) was John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Department of the Treasury, towards the end of 1941.. By 1948, \\"economic integration\\" was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches.. Paul Hoffman, then head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, used the term in a 1949 speech to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. As The New York Times put it, Globalism emerged as a dominant set of ideologies in the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of globalization intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.. In 2010, Manfred Steger and Paul James theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies..

In the legends he is often featured alongside fellow bogatyrs Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich.Josepha Sherman, Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore, Routledge, 2015, , pp. 234-235, \\"Ilya Murometz/Ilya of Murom\\" Although Ilya Muromets's adventures are mostly a matter of legend, he is associated with a historical figure: a medieval warrior, and in later life a monk, named . Venerable Ilya Pechersky is beatified as a monastic saint of the Orthodox Church. His relics are preserved in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, Ukraine. Ilya in byliny According to legends, Ilya Muromets, the son of a farmer, was born in a village near Murom. He suffered a serious illness in his youth and was unable to walk until the age of 33. He could only lie on a Russian stove, until he was miraculously healed by two pilgrims. He was then given super-human strength by a dying knight ‚Äì Svyatogor ‚Äì and set out to liberate the city of Kiev from Idolishche to serve Prince Vladimir the Fair Sun (Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko). Along the way he single-handedly defended the city of Chernigov (modern day Ukrainian Chernihiv) from nomadic invasion (possibly by the Polovtsi) and was offered knighthood by the local ruler, but Ilya declined to stay. In the forests of Bryansk he then killed the forest-dwelling monster Nightingale the Robber (Solovei-Razboinik), who murdered travelers with his powerful whistle. In Kiev, Ilya was made chief bogatyr by Prince Vladimir and he defended Rus' from numerous attacks by the steppe people, including , the (mythical) tsar of the Golden Horde. Generous and simple-minded but also temperamental, Ilya once went on a rampage and destroyed all the church steeples in Kiev after Prince Vladimir failed to invite him to a celebration. He was soon appeased when Vladimir sent for him. Ilya as a saint Forensic reconstruction of Ilya Muromets by Sergey Nikitin It is generally believed that Muromets's prototype was Venerable Ilya Pechersky, a monastic saint of the Orthodox Church, beatified in 1643. According to hagiography, before taking his monastic vows Ilya was a warrior famous for his strength. His nickname was Chobotok, Old East Slavic for \\"(small) boot\\", given to him after an incident when Ilya, caught by surprise, fought off enemies with only his boot.\\"–°—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ –ò–ª—å–µ\\", Vokrug Sveta, Magazine, January 1994 In 1988, Soviet archeologists exhumed Ilya Chobotok's remains, stored in Kiev Pechersk Lavra, and studied them. Their report suggested that at least some parts of the legend may be true: the man was tall, and his bones carried signs of spinal disease at early age and marks from numerous wounds, one of which was fatal. Legendary status  Incorrupt relic of saint Ilya Muromets in the Near Caves at Kiev Pechersk Lavra Bogatyrs (1898), a famous painting by Viktor Vasnetsov. Ilya Muromets is in the center, with Dobrynya Nikitich on the left, and Alyosha Popovich on the right Ilya Muromets's name became a synonym of an outstanding physical and spiritual power and integrity, dedicated to the protection of the Homeland and People. Over time he became a hero of numerous movies, pictures, monuments, cartoons and anecdotes. He is the only epic hero canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. Although the remains of Ilya Muromets are supposedly stored in Kiev Pechersk Monastery, his character probably does not represent a unique historical persona, but rather a fusion of multiple real or fictional heroes from vastly different epochs. Thus Ilya supposedly served Prince Vladimir of Kiev (ruled 980‚Äì1015); he fought Batu Khan, the founder of Golden Horde (c. 1205‚Äì55); he saved Constantine the God-Loving, the tsar of Constantinople, from a monster (there were a number of Byzantine emperors named Constantine, one of them a contemporary of Prince Vladimir, named Constantine VIII (); it could also be a reference to Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (), who encountered Olga of Kiev in the 950s; but the one Emperor in Constantinople with this name most likely to be called \\"God-loving\\" was Constantine XI, ).

For many years she lived and worked in Paris, France. Her art is known for its symbolism, and the metaphorical use of existing objects, including human hair. Early life Lucien Parent's children. Parent was born Marie Parent in Montreal, Quebec.\\"Great Works: Ma√Ætresse, 1996, by Mimi Parent\\" . The Independent, Michael Glover, October 27, 2012 She was the eighth of the nine children of architect Lucien Parent. Between 1942 and 1947 she studied art at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Montr√©al where she met her future husband, fellow art student Jean Beno√Æt. While she was there, she studied under Alfred Pellan who influenced Parent's work. Parent was later expelled from the school after joining a controversial artists' group, called Prisme d‚Äôyeux. Career In Canada, Parent identified with the Surrealist movement, as well as automatism, and in 1959, she became a member of the Paris Surrealist Group. Parent associated with other surrealist artists, such as Andre Breton and Marcel Duchamp. Parent participated in the International Surrealist Exhibition, devoted to Eros. During 1964‚Äì1967, Parent made Anti-Gaullist posters, and she was involved in protests in Paris in May 1968. Parent illustrated books for Guy Cabanel and Jose Pierre. Parent was most known for her 3D tableaux boxes. In these boxes, Parent would include figures and elements relating to mythology, folklore, and her unconscious imagination. Parent often incorporated elements of lunar and solar forces, representing masculinity and femininity. Parent was raised in a Catholic household, and her work showed influences of her faith and eroticism. Parent incorporated materials such as human hair, in her art objects. One of her well known pieces Maitresse, 1996, was a whip, with the lash being composed of two braids of her hair. In 1947 she had her first one-woman exhibition at the Dominion Gallery in Montreal which received praise from Time. In 1948 she received the C√©zanne medal. That year she married Benoit, and the two moved to Paris.\\"Mimi Parent, artiste surr√©aliste\\" . Le Monde, June 17, 2005. On December 2, 1959, she participated in Jean Benoit's performance, L‚ÄôExecution du testament du marquis de Sade, a ceremony in which Benoit brands the letters SADE in his chest while dressed with accessories representing Eros and Thanatos. This ceremony established the two as centers of the Parisian surrealist group, led by Andre Breton. Between 1964 and 1967, they participated together in many soirees at the Le Ranelagh theatre in Paris, and in 1965, exhibited at the ‚ÄúL‚ÄôEcart absolu‚Äù exposition. She exhibited at the \\"Surrealist intrusion into the Enchanter's Domain\\" in New York in 1960 and in 1966 had a solo exhibition at the \\"Maya\\" gallery in Brussels. She also exhibited in Chicago, London, Lausanne and Frankfurt. She assisted with the organization of the \\"Exposition inteRnatiOnale du Surr√©alisme\\" (EROS), which ran in Paris from December 1959 to the following February; although this is often attributed to Duchamp, she came up with the ideas for the exhibit catalogue, titled Boite Alerte ‚Äì Missives Lascives, which was presented as a green box into which ideas could be 'posted'. Parent lived and worked in Paris, France and continued creating art in her later years. Her art medium turned to ink drawings. She had many solo exhibitions throughout her life (Galerie Andr√©-Fran√ßois Petit, Paris, 1984; Museum Bochum, 1984; Noyers-sur-Serein, 1992) and was active as an artist until the end of her days.

Its upper drainage basin includes the remote forested hills in the center of the island. It empties into the Fresh Kills. Its source is Ohrbach Lake, located on the grounds of the Pouch Camp, maintained by the Boy Scouts of America. From there, it enters the Greenbelt, crossing underneath the intersection of Manor Road and Rockland Avenue. It enters the Egbertville Ravine, then emerges from the ravine and flows along the east side of Lighthouse Hill. There, it skims the western edge of the Richmondtown neighborhood and through Historic Richmond Town. South of Richmondtown, it emerges into a wide floodplain that has been designated as part of Staten Island's Bluebelt, a region of protected wetlands. It flows under Richmond Avenue south of the Staten Island Mall, and flows into the Fresh Kills alongside the former Fresh Kills Landfill and the developing Freshkills Park. In colonial times and in the early 19th century, the creek was used to operate up to 11 mills in the center of the island. One such mill is being restored along the creek in Historic Richmond Town. In late 2017, a family of beavers moved into the creek, cut down over 100 trees, and contributed to local flooding. DEP destroyed a small dam, but the beavers repaired it overnight.

It is situated on road and rail routes to the Simplon Pass. History The Grand Hotel in Stresa The name of this town first appeared in documents in AD 998. In the 15th century, it grew into a fishing community and owed feudal allegiance to the Visconti family. It subsequently came under the control of the Borromeo family. In 1948 American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway visited the town. He had set part of his 1929 novel Farewell to Arms in the Grand Hotel des Iles Borromees. In 2002 Stresa hosted the 10th International Hemingway Conference. Stresa has played host to a number of political conferences in the 20th century, including in: *1935: the UK, Italy and France re-affirm the Treaty of Locarno and agree to form the Stresa front to combat and contain Nazi Germany. *1958: the foundations of what would become Europe's Common Agricultural Policy of the European Economic Community were formulated in Stresa. Stresa is also the venue for the \\"Settimane Musicali\\"; an international classical music festival which is held annually in the summer. The cable car to Monte Mottarone Transport Regular boat services from the town's two docks provide access to the nearby Borromean Islands. The cable-car offers a 20-minute ride to the summit of Monte Mottarone, with the Giardino Botanico Alpinia en route. Eurocity services connect to Milano, Berne and Geneva.

The underlying random variables may be random real numbers, or they may be random vectors (each having the same dimension), in which case the mixture distribution is a multivariate distribution. In cases where each of the underlying random variables is continuous, the outcome variable will also be continuous and its probability density function is sometimes referred to as a mixture density. The cumulative distribution function (and the probability density function if it exists) can be expressed as a convex combination (i.e. a weighted sum, with non-negative weights that sum to 1) of other distribution functions and density functions. The individual distributions that are combined to form the mixture distribution are called the mixture components, and the probabilities (or weights) associated with each component are called the mixture weights. The number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to being finite, although in some cases the components may be countably infinite. More general cases (i.e. an uncountable set of component distributions), as well as the countable case, are treated under the title of compound distributions. A distinction needs to be made between a random variable whose distribution function or density is the sum of a set of components (i.e. a mixture distribution) and a random variable whose value is the sum of the values of two or more underlying random variables, in which case the distribution is given by the convolution operator. As an example, the sum of two jointly normally distributed random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution. On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution. Mixture distributions arise in many contexts in the literature and arise naturally where a statistical population contains two or more subpopulations. They are also sometimes used as a means of representing non-normal distributions. Data analysis concerning statistical models involving mixture distributions is discussed under the title of mixture models, while the present article concentrates on simple probabilistic and statistical properties of mixture distributions and how these relate to properties of the underlying distributions.  Finite and countable mixtures  Density of a mixture of three normal distributions (Œº = 5, 10, 15, œÉ = 2) with equal weights. Each component is shown as a weighted density (each integrating to 1/3) Given a finite set of probability density functions p1(x), ‚Ä¶, pn(x), or corresponding cumulative distribution functions P1(x), ‚Ä¶, Pn(x) and weights w1, ‚Ä¶, wn such that and the mixture distribution can be represented by writing either the density, f, or the distribution function, F, as a sum (which in both cases is a convex combination): : F(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\, w_i \\\\, P_i(x), : f(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\, w_i \\\\, p_i(x) . This type of mixture, being a finite sum, is called a finite mixture, and in applications, an unqualified reference to a \\"mixture density\\" usually means a finite mixture. The case of a countably infinite set of components is covered formally by allowing n = \\\\infty\\\\\\\\! .  Uncountable mixtures  Where the set of component distributions is uncountable, the result is often called a compound probability distribution. The construction of such distributions has a formal similarity to that of mixture distributions, with either infinite summations or integrals replacing the finite summations used for finite mixtures. Consider a probability density function p(x;a) for a variable x, parameterized by a. That is, for each value of a in some set A, p(x;a) is a probability density function with respect to x. Given a probability density function w (meaning that w is nonnegative and integrates to 1), the function : f(x) = \\\\int_A \\\\, w(a) \\\\, p(x;a) \\\\, da is again a probability density function for x. A similar integral can be written for the cumulative distribution function. Note that the formulae here reduce to the case of a finite or infinite mixture if the density w is allowed to be a generalized function representing the \\"derivative\\" of the cumulative distribution function of a discrete distribution. Mixtures within a parametric family The mixture components are often not arbitrary probability distributions, but instead are members of a parametric family (such as normal distributions), with different values for a parameter or parameters. In such cases, assuming that it exists, the density can be written in the form of a sum as: : f(x; a_1, \\\\ldots , a_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\, w_i \\\\, p(x;a_i) for one parameter, or : f(x; a_1, \\\\ldots , a_n, b_1, \\\\ldots , b_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\, w_i \\\\, p(x;a_i,b_i) for two parameters, and so forth.  Properties   Convexity  A general linear combination of probability density functions is not necessarily a probability density, since it may be negative or it may integrate to something other than 1. However, a convex combination of probability density functions preserves both of these properties (non- negativity and integrating to 1), and thus mixture densities are themselves probability density functions.  Moments  Let X1, ..., Xn denote random variables from the n component distributions, and let X denote a random variable from the mixture distribution. Then, for any function H(¬∑) for which \\\\operatorname{E}[H(X_i)] exists, and assuming that the component densities pi(x) exist, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[H(X)] & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty H(x) \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i p_i(x) \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty p_i(x) H(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \\\\operatorname{E}[H(X_i)]. \\\\end{align} The jth moment about zero (i.e. choosing ) is simply a weighted average of the jth moments of the components. Moments about the mean involve a binomial expansion:Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1.2.4) : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[(X - \\\\mu)^j] & = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \\\\operatorname{E}[(X - \\\\mu_i + \\\\mu_i - \\\\mu)^j] \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\\\sum_{k=0}^j \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} j \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{array} \\\\right) (\\\\mu_i - \\\\mu)^{j-k} \\\\operatorname{E}[(X - \\\\mu_i)^k], \\\\end{align} where Œºi denotes the mean of the ith component. In the case of a mixture of one-dimensional distributions with weights wi, means Œºi and variances œÉi2, the total mean and variance will be: : \\\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\\\mu = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \\\\mu_i , : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[(X - \\\\mu)^2] & = \\\\sigma^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\operatorname{E}[X^2] - \\\\mu^{2} & (\\\\mathrm{standard}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{variance}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{reformulation})\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\\\\operatorname{E}[X_i^2])) - \\\\mu^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\\\\sigma_i^2 + \\\\mu_i^{2})) - \\\\mu^{2} & (\\\\mathrm{from}\\\\ \\\\sigma_i^2 = \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i^2] - \\\\mu_i^{2}, \\\\mathrm{therefore}\\\\ , \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i^2] = \\\\sigma_i^2 + \\\\mu_i^{2})\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\\\\sigma_i^2 + \\\\mu_i^{2} - \\\\mu^{2}). \\\\end{align} These relations highlight the potential of mixture distributions to display non- trivial higher-order moments such as skewness and kurtosis (fat tails) and multi-modality, even in the absence of such features within the components themselves. Marron and Wand (1992) give an illustrative account of the flexibility of this framework., http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176348653 Modes The question of multimodality is simple for some cases, such as mixtures of exponential distributions: all such mixtures are unimodal.Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1) However, for the case of mixtures of normal distributions, it is a complex one. Conditions for the number of modes in a multivariate normal mixture are explored by Ray & Lindsay extending the earlier work on univariate Robertson CA, Fryer JG (1969) Some descriptive properties of normal mixtures. Skand Aktuarietidskr 137‚Äì146 and multivariate distributions (Carreira-Perpinan and Williams, 2003http://faculty2.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/papers/EDI-INF- RR-0159.pdf). Here the problem of evaluation of the modes of an n component mixture in a D dimensional space is reduced to identification of critical points (local minima, maxima and saddle points) on a manifold referred to as the ridgeline surface, which is the image of the ridgeline function : x^{*}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\alpha_i \\\\Sigma_i^{-1} \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\alpha_i \\\\Sigma_i^{-1} \\\\mu_i \\\\right], where Œ± belongs to the dimensional unit simplex \\\\mathcal{S}_n = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n: \\\\alpha_i \\\\in [0,1], \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i = 1 \\\\\\\\} and correspond to the covariance and mean of the ith component. Ray & Lindsay consider the case in which showing a one-to-one correspondence of modes of the mixture and those on the elevation function thus one may identify the modes by solving \\\\frac{d h(\\\\alpha)}{d \\\\alpha} = 0 with respect to Œ± and determining the value x*(Œ±). Using graphical tools, the potential multi-modality of } mixtures is demonstrated; in particular it is shown that the number of modes may exceed n and that the modes may not be coincident with the component means. For two components they develop a graphical tool for analysis by instead solving the aforementioned differential with respect to w1 and expressing the solutions as a function Œ†(Œ±), so that the number and location of modes for a given value of w1 corresponds to the number of intersections of the graph on the line . This in turn can be related to the number of oscillations of the graph and therefore to solutions of \\\\frac{d \\\\Pi(\\\\alpha)}{d \\\\alpha} = 0 leading to an explicit solution for a two component homoscedastic mixture given by : 1 - \\\\alpha(1-\\\\alpha) d_M(\\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2, \\\\Sigma)^2 where is the Mahalanobis distance. Since the above is quadratic it follows that in this instance there are at most two modes irrespective of the dimension or the weights. Examples Two normal distributions Simple examples can be given by a mixture of two normal distributions. (See Multimodal distribution#Mixture of two normal distributions for more details.) Given an equal (50/50) mixture of two normal distributions with the same standard deviation and different means (homoscedastic), the overall distribution will exhibit low kurtosis relative to a single normal distribution ‚Äì the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, namely by twice the (common) standard deviation, so \\\\left\\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2\\\\right > 2\\\\sigma, these form a bimodal distribution, otherwise it simply has a wide peak. The variation of the overall population will also be greater than the variation of the two subpopulations (due to spread from different means), and thus exhibits overdispersion relative to a normal distribution with fixed variation \\\\sigma, though it will not be overdispersed relative to a normal distribution with variation equal to variation of the overall population. Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution. File:Bimodal.pngUnivariate mixture distribution, showing bimodal distribution File:Bimodal-bivariate-small.pngMultivariate mixture distribution, showing four modes A normal and a Cauchy distribution The following example is adapted from Hampel, who credits John Tukey. Consider the mixture distribution defined by :. The mean of i.i.d. observations from behaves \\"normally\\" except for exorbitantly large samples, although the mean of does not even exist.  Applications  Mixture densities are complicated densities expressible in terms of simpler densities (the mixture components), and are used both because they provide a good model for certain data sets (where different subsets of the data exhibit different characteristics and can best be modeled separately), and because they can be more mathematically tractable, because the individual mixture components can be more easily studied than the overall mixture density. Mixture densities can be used to model a statistical population with subpopulations, where the mixture components are the densities on the subpopulations, and the weights are the proportions of each subpopulation in the overall population. Mixture densities can also be used to model experimental error or contamination ‚Äì one assumes that most of the samples measure the desired phenomenon, Parametric statistics that assume no error often fail on such mixture densities ‚Äì for example, statistics that assume normality often fail disastrously in the presence of even a few outliers ‚Äì and instead one uses robust statistics. In meta-analysis of separate studies, study heterogeneity causes distribution of results to be a mixture distribution, and leads to overdispersion of results relative to predicted error. For example, in a statistical survey, the margin of error (determined by sample size) predicts the sampling error and hence dispersion of results on repeated surveys. The presence of study heterogeneity (studies have different sampling bias) increases the dispersion relative to the margin of error.

Bailey: Teacher, Scholar, Popularizer,\\" Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 56, No. 2 (May 1987): 166 Bailey contended foreign policy was significantly affected by public opinion, and that current policymakers could learn from history. Career Bailey received his B.A. (1924), M.A. (1925), and Ph.D (1927) from Stanford University, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. His doctoral work was in U.S. political history. He switched his emphasis towards diplomatic history while teaching at the University of Hawaii.DeConde, \\"Thomas A. Bailey,\\" 174. After three years at Hawaii, he taught American history for nearly 40 years at Stanford and also served as a visiting professor at Harvard, Cornell, the University of Washington, and the National War College in Washington, D.C. He retired in 1968. Bailey authored a number of articles in the 1930s that indicated the historical techniques he would use throughout his career. While not groundbreaking, they remain noteworthy for the care with which Bailey systematically overturned received myths about U.S. diplomatic history by a careful reexamination of the underlying sources.Langley, \\"The Diplomatic Historians,\\" p. 52-54. His first book was a study of the diplomatic crisis between the United States and Japan during the Theodore Roosevelt administration over racial issues.Bailey, Theodore Roosevelt and the Japanese- American Crisis: An Account of the International Complications Arising from the Race Problems on the Pacific Coast (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1934). He delivered the Albert Shaw Lectures on Diplomatic History at Johns Hopkins on the Wilson administration's policy towards neutrals in 1917-1918, later published in 1942.Bailey, The Policy of the United States Toward the Neutrals, 1917-1918 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1942) While the theme of the impact of public opinion on the making of foreign policy was a theme through most of his works, he laid it out most clearly in The Man in the Street, published in 1948. Perhaps the harshest attack on Wilson's to diplomacy came from Bailey in two books that remain widely cited by scholars, Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace (1944) and Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal (1945), Bailey: :contended that Wilson's wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war's end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson's progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others, including House, did not emerge unscathed. Scot D. Bruce, \\"Woodrow Wilson's House: The Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\\" Reviews in American History 45#4 (2017) pp 623-24.

One of Bailey's students from the 1940s, Betty Miller Unterberger, was elected president of the SHAFR in 1986, the first woman in the position at a time when the organization was 99 percent male. It was Bailey who introduced Unterberger to the subject of one of her prime interests, the Russian Civil War between 1918 and 1920. He was married to Sylvia Dean, daughter of a former University of Hawaii president. Honors and awards In 1960 he served as president of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association. In 1968, he was elected to the presidencies of both the Organization of American Historians and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. The Commonwealth Club awarded him gold medals in 1940 for his Diplomatic History of the American People and 1944 for his Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace.

The term carries the implication, whether or not specified, that the referent is superior in some way. Though the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today it is particularly applied with respect to particular nations or regions. Other uses of the term include medical and genetic exceptionalism. History The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762‚Äì1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the Volk, comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions. Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a \\"national spirit\\", or \\"soul of the people\\" (in German: Volksgeist). This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands‚Äîespecially in ones ruled by √©lites from somewhere else.Royal J. Schmidt, \\"Cultural Nationalism in Herder\\", Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 17, No. 3 (June 1956), pp. 407‚Äì17 in JSTOR Hans Kohn, \\"The Paradox of Fichte's Nationalism\\", Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 10, No. 3 (June 1949), pp. 319‚Äì43 in JSTOR Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the United States, Australia, France, Germany, Greece, India, Pakistan, Imperial Japan, Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Africa, Spain, Britain, the USSR, the European Union, and Thailand. Historians have added many other cases, including historic empires such as China, the Ottoman Empire, ancient Rome, and ancient India, along with a wide range of minor kingdoms in history.See Christopher K. Chase-Dunn, Thomas D. Hall, and E. Susan Manning, \\"Rise and Fall: East-West Synchronicity and Indic Exceptionalism Reexamined\\", Social Science History, Volume 24, Number 4, Winter 2000, pp. 727‚Äì54 in Project Muse  Criticism  Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to historicism in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons . A group may assert exceptionalism in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications . This can be an example of special pleading, a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons .  Separateness  J. Bradford DeLong has used the term \\"exceptionalism\\" to describe the economic growth of post-World War II Western Europe. Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to historicism in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. Political scientist Noritada Matsuda writes, \\"[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries.\\" In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert exceptionalism, with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of special pleading, a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison. The term \\"exceptionalism\\" can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the United States government to join various international treaties is sometimes called \\"exceptionalist\\". Medical exceptionalism Use of the term \\"HIV exceptionalism\\" implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases. Genetic exceptionalism is a policy program that medicalizes genetic information. Like the exceptionalism surrounding HIV testing, genetic exceptionalism is based on the belief that the average person needs a licensed health professional for guidance and support through the discovery of information with health implications, even if this information is common knowledge, such as that the person has red hair, which is associated with a higher risk of sunburns and skin cancer. In countries with strong genetic exceptionalism laws, permission from a physician is necessary to obtain information about one's genes.

Praxis is a key to understanding the Byzantine tradition, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Eastern Catholic Churches. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint Maximus the Confessor: \\"Theology without action is the theology of demons.\\"Virginia Fabella, Sergio Torres (editors), Doing Theology in a Divided World (Orbis Books 1985 ), p. 15Paul W. Chilcote, Wesley Speaks on Christian Vocation (Wipf and Stock 2001 ), p. 67Mission among Other Faiths: An Orthodox Perspective Union with God, to which Eastern Christians hold that Jesus invited man, requires not just faith, but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the Scriptures (1 Cor 11:2, 2 Thes 2:14) and the Church Fathers, and is linked with the term praxis in Byzantine theology and vocabulary. In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of 'theory and practice'. Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox do. Praxis is 'living Orthodoxy'. Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with worship. \\"Orthopraxis\\" is said to mean \\"right glory\\" or \\"right worship\\"; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of liturgy (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the West, Christianity has been reduced \\"to intellectual, ethical or social categories,\\" whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the Body of Christ and providing the path to \\"true religious education.\\" A \\"symbiosis of worship and work\\" is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis. Fasting, another key part of the practice of the Christian faith, is mentioned as part of Byzantine praxis, in connection with the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 6), and in comparison with the history and commemorations of Lenten fasts. Praxis may also refer to proper religious etiquette.  Corresponding terminology in Latin Christianity  In the Latin Church, parallel ideas of asceticism and worship exist. The word used in this regard is the regular English word \\"practice\\", since in English the term \\"praxis\\" is not normally used in this sense. The simplest and most common understanding of the term \\"practising Catholic\\", a minimal interpretation of the phrase, is that the person has been baptized (or canonically received into full communion with the Catholic Church) and strives to observe the Church's precept of attending celebration of the Mass or Divine Liturgy on Sundays and holy days of obligation.Catholic Schools and the Definition of a \\"Practising Catholic\\" Someone who does not fulfil even this minimum requirement for being considered \\"practising\\" is referred to as a lapsed Catholic. A more ample indication of what practice involves is given in a statement by Bishop Luc Matthys of Armidale, New South Wales, Australia.What distinguishes a practising Catholic? Living the Catholic faith involves much more than the minimum requirements referred to above. Matters such as fasting have applications that vary according to place and according to the autonomous particular Church to which a person belongs. In each of the Eastern Catholic Churches, practice is generally the same as in the associated Eastern Church with which it is not in full communion. Thus, practice in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite is identical with that described above for the Churches that constitute the Eastern Orthodox Church, but differs from that of, for instance, the Syro- Malabar Catholic Church. Within the Latin Church too, there are variations in such matters in accordance with rules laid down by the episcopal conferences in view of local conditions and traditions.  Modern meaning of \\"praxis\\"  In English the word \\"praxis\\" is more commonly used in the sense not of practice but with the meaning given to it by Immanuel Kant, namely application of a theory to cases encountered in experience or reasoning about what there should be as opposed to what there is: this meaning Karl Marx made central to his philosophical ideal of transforming the world through revolutionary activity.Simon Blackburn, Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Oxford University Press 2005 ), pp.287-288 Proponents of Latin American liberation theology have used the word \\"praxis\\" with specific reference to human activity directed towards transforming the conditions and causes of poverty. Their \\"liberation theology\\" consists then in applying the Gospel to that praxis to guide and govern it.D. A.

Eastern Orthodox theology  The term phronema is used in Eastern Orthodox theology to one particular mindset or outlook ‚Äì the Orthodox mind.The appeal to Tradition was actually an appeal to the mind of the Church, her phronema. It was a method to discover and ascertain the faith as it had been always held, from the very beginning: semper creditum. The permanence of Christian belief was the most conspicuous sign and token of its truth: no innovations [For further discussion of this topic see my articles: \\"The Function of Tradition in the Ancient Church,\\" The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, IX (No. 2, 1964), 181-200, and \\"Scripture and Tradition: An Orthodox point of view,\\" Dialog, II (No. 4, 1963), 288-293.

An Eastern Orthodox View by Archpriest George Florovsky (1893-1979) The attaining of phronema in this sense is a matter of practicing the correct faith (orthodoxia) in the correct manner (orthopraxis). Attaining phronema is regarded as the first step toward theosis, the state of glorification. Phronema is also the name of the official annual review of St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College, Sydney, Australia. It presents articles and book reviews from Orthodox and non-Orthodox on topics with central reference to theology, Church history and Orthodoxy. Phronema, volume 23, 2008  Use by John Henry Newman  The term was used in by John Henry Newman in an article published in 1859 under the title \\"On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine\\". He said that the consensus of the faithful is to be regarded as \\"a sort of instinct, or phronƒìma, deep in the bosom of the mystical body of Christ\\".John Henry Newman, On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine (Rambler, July 1859)  Use by Ernst Haeckel  The term was used in by Ernst Haeckel in his book The Wonders of LifeErnst Haeckel, The Wonders of Life: A Popular Study of Biological Philosophy (London, 1904, Watts & Co.) where (p. 342) the phronema is the name given to a part of the cortex, as ‚Äúthe real organ of mind‚Äù.

The one-man play premiered Off- Broadway in 2003 at Playwrights Horizons. It opened on Broadway later that year. The play was developed with Mois√©s Kaufman and his Tectonic Theater Project, and Kaufman also acted as director. Jefferson Mays starred in the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, playing some forty roles. Wright received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. I Am My Own Wife (or I Am My Own Woman) is also the English title of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf's autobiography, first issued in 1992, translated in 1995.  Plot synopsis  I Am My Own Wife is an examination of the life of German antiquarian Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, born Lothar Berfelde, who killed her father when she was a young child and survived the Nazi and Communist regimes in East Berlin as a transgender women.  Productions  I Am My Own Wife began with Moises Kauffman and Doug Wright at About Face Theatre in Chicago in 2002, and moved to Broadway in 2004 where it won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play (Mays) and Best Play. It was first produced as a workshop in July 2001 at the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla CA.La Jolla Playhouse Workshops Wright's I Am My Own Wife July 10-29Playbill Premieres In 2004, the play had its European premiere at Stockholms Stadsteater, Stockholm, starring Bj√∂rn Kjellman. In 2005, it had its American regional premiere at Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati, starring Todd Almond. That production then traveled to Actors Theatre of Louisville and Florida Studio Theatre. In 2006, the play was staged in Hudson, New York at Stageworks/Hudson starring Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn, in Toronto, Ontario at CanStage, with Stephen Ouimette in the starring role, in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Playhouse Theatre with Canadian actor Tom Rooney, at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal with actor Brett Christopher, in Portland, Oregon at the Gerding Theater starring actor Wade McCollum, in Portland, Maine at the Portland Stage Company starring actor Tom Ford, and in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Performance Network Theatre starring actor Malcolm Tulip. In January 2007, the San Pedro Playhouse in San Antonio, Texas successfully mounted the play. It was also performed at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey from January 16, 2007 to February 11, 2007. It featured Mark Nelson, and was directed by Anders Cato. Vince Gatton performed the role in a production directed by Andrew Volkoff at Barrington Stage Company in 2008. A French translation (Ma femme, c'est moi) was performed in February 2009 at Th√©√¢tre du Rideau Vert in Montreal. It also ran at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, starring Helen Hayes award winner Andrew Long, and directed by Alan Paul, and at Theater Three in Port Jefferson, New York, featuring Jeffrey Sanzel. Between May 6 and May 23, 2009, it played in Tasmania at the Earl Arts Centre in Launceston, and the Theatre Royal, Hobart Backspace, produced by the Tasmanian Theatre Company and featuring Robert Jarman. In the Czech Republic, the play was premiered in 2008 by Divadlo Let√≠ in Prague, starring Pavol Smol√°rik. At the same time it was also staged by a Czech non-professional theater group with Libor Ulovec in the role. The latter was awarded the Best Czech Non-Professional Drama Performance 2009 and Libor Ulovec received (among others) the Best Czech Non-Professional Actor Prize 2009. In Mexico it is starring by the actor Hector Bonilla who, on January 23, 2010, accomplished 100 performances, with 89 standing ovations by that time. It was also performed in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, at Gettysburg Stage starring actor Eric Jones. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the play was part of the renowned Jungle Theater's 2011-2012 season. It was directed by Joel Sass in that venue, and Bradley Greenwald embodied the stageful of characters in an amazing tour de force performance. It ran from November 4 though December 18. In Greece, I Am My Own Wife had its premiere in January 2011, in Bios Basement, Athens. It was produced by Degreezero Theatre Company, translated and directed by Iossif Vardakis and performed by Haris Attonis with the original music of Marietta Fafouti who also composed a special song for the show, named \\"Ich Erinnere Mich\\" ‚Äî lyrics by Dimitris Dimopoulos. It went on for 20 performances and carried on for the following season, moving to 104 theatre, in Athens and opening in November 2011 for the second run. It has received great acceptance and outstanding critiques both for the whole of the show but for Haris Attonis' exceptional performance, as well. The play itself and the story of Charlotte are very well-timed with the political and social situation in Greece. The staging itself is very minimal and it has been considered to be one of the most emotional presentations, internationally and there have been innovations like the beard and the lack of the head scarf, for the very first time. Haris Attonis won the 2012 Best Male Theatre Performance Award for I Am My Own Wife in Athens Voice Best Choice and Audience Awards and Marietta Fafouti won the 2012 Best Original Theatre Music for I Am My Own Wife in the Gay Theatre Awards. I Am My Own Wife returned to Chicago's About Face Theatre in November 2016 in a re-imagined production directed by artistic director Andrew Volkoff using four actors and featuring Delia Kropp in the role of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. This production marks the first known professional performance of the role by a trans actor. It was met with high praise from area critics as well as the author. I Am My Own Wife opens on March 14, 2019 at Out Front Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia featuring Peter Smith playing all roles in the show. This production will mark the first professional production where a trans/gender-non-conforming performer portrays all characters in the piece.

He is also known as Macarius the Elder, Macarius the Great and The Lamp of the Desert. Life St. Macarius was born in Lower Egypt. A late tradition places his birthplace in the village of Shabsheer (Shanshour), in Al Minufiyah Governorate, Egypt around 300 A.D. At some point before his pursuit of asceticism, Macarius made his living smuggling saltpeter in the vicinity of Nitria, a vocation which taught him how to survive in and travel across the wastes in that area.Harmless, William. Desert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism, p. 174, (Oxford University Press, 2004) St. Macarius is known for his wisdom. His friends and close kin used to call him Paidarion Geron (,which when compounded as Paidiogeron led to , Pidar Yougiron) which meant the ‚Äúold young man‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúthe young man with the elders‚Äô wisdom.\\" At the wish of his parents Macarius entered into marriage, but was soon widowed. Shortly after, his parents died as well. Macarius subsequently distributed all his money among the poor and needy. He found a teacher in an experienced Elder, who lived in the desert not far from the village. The Elder accepted the youth, guided him in the spiritual science of watchfulness, fasting and prayer, and taught him the handicraft of weaving baskets. A while later, a pregnant woman accused him of having defiled her. Macarius did not attempt to defend himself, and accepted the accusation in silence. However, when the woman's delivery drew near, her labor became exceedingly difficult. She did not manage to give birth until she confessed Macarius's innocence. A multitude of people then came asking for his forgiveness, but he fled to the Nitrian Desert to escape all mundane glory. As a hermit, Macarius spent seven years living on only pulse and raw herbs.Butler, Alban. (1866). The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints. Dublin. p. 35 He spent the following three years consuming four or five ounces of bread a day and only one vessel of oil a year. While at the desert, he visited Anthony the Great and learned from him the laws and rules of monasticism. When he returned to the Scetic Desert at the age of forty, he became a priest. The fame of his sanctity drew many followers. The community, which took up its residence in the desert, was of the semi- eremitical type. The monks were not bound by any fixed rule; their cells were close together, and they met for Divine worship only on Saturdays or Sundays. He presided over this monastic community for the rest of his life. For a brief period of time, Macarius was banished to an island in the Nile by the Emperor Valens, along with Saint Macarius of Alexandria, during a dispute over the doctrine of the Nicene Creed. Both men were victims of religious persecution by the followers of then Bishop Lucius of Alexandria. During their time on the island, the daughter of a pagan priest had become ill. The people of the island believed that she was possessed by an evil spirit. Both saints prayed over the daughter, which in turn had saved her. The pagan people of the island were so impressed and grateful that they stopped their worship of the pagan gods and built a church. When word of this got back to the Emperor Valens and Bishop Lucius of Alexandria, they quickly allowed both men to return home. At their return on 13 Paremhat, they were met by a multitude of monks of the Nitrian Desert, numbered fifty thousand, among whom were Saint Pishoy and Saint John the Dwarf. Death and relics Macarius died in the year 391. After his death, the natives of his village of Shabsheer stole the body and built a great church for him in their village. Pope Michael V of Alexandria brought the relics of Saint Macarius back to the Nitrian Desert on 19 Mesori. Today, the body of Saint Macarius is found in his monastery, the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in Scetes, Egypt. Attributed writings: the 50 Spiritual Homilies and Letters St. Macarius the Great standing next to a Cherub. Fifty Spiritual Homilies were ascribed to Macarius a few generations after his death, and these texts had a widespread and considerable influence on Eastern monasticism and Protestant pietism.Frances Young, From Nicaea to Chalcedon, (2nd edn, 2010), p116 This was particularly in the context of the debate concerning the 'extraordinary giftings' of the Holy Spirit in the post- apostolic age, since the Macarian Homilies could serve as evidence in favour of a post-apostolic attestation of 'miraculous' Pneumatic giftings to include healings, visions, exorcisms, etc. The Macarian Homilies have thus influenced Pietist groups ranging from the Spiritual Franciscans (West) to Eastern Orthodox monastic practice to John Wesley to modern charismatic Christianity. However, modern patristic scholars have established that it is not likely that Macarius the Egyptian was their author.Johannes Quasten, Patrology Vol. 3. Utrecht, 1966, 162-164. The identity of the author of these fifty Spiritual Homilies has not been definitively established, although it is evident from statements in them that the author was from Upper Mesopotamia, where the Roman Empire bordered the Persian Empire, and that they were not written later than 534.J. Quasten, Patrology Vol. 3, 164-165. In addition to the homilies, a number of letters have been ascribed to Macarius. Gennadius (De viris illustribus 10) recognizes only one genuine letter of Macarius, which is addressed to younger monks. The first letter, called \\"Ad filios Dei,\\" may indeed be the genuine letter by Macarius the Egyptian that is mentioned by Gennadius (Vir. Ill.10), but the other letters are probably not by Macarius. The second letter, the so-called \\"Great Letter\\" used the De instituto christiana of Gregory of Nyssa, which was written c. 390; the style and content of the \\"Great Letter\\" suggest that its author is the same anonymous Mesopotamian who wrote the fifty Spiritual Homilies.J. Quasten, Patrology Vol. 3, p. 167 The seven so-called Opuscula ascetica edited under his name by Petrus Possinus (Paris, 1683) are merely later compilations from the homilies, made by Simeon the Logothete, who is probably identical with Simeon Metaphrastes (d. 950). The teachings of Macarius are characterized by a strong Pneumatic emphasis that closely intertwines the salvific work of Jesus Christ (as the 'Spirit of Christ') with the supernatural workings of the Holy Spirit. This 'Pneumatic' thrust in the Spiritual Homilies is often termed 'mystical' and as such is a spiritual mode of thought which has endeared him to Christian mystics of all ages, although, on the other hand, in his anthropology and soteriology he frequently approximates the standpoint of St. Augustine. Certain passages of his homilies assert the entire depravity of man, while others postulate free will, even after the fall of Adam, and presuppose a tendency toward virtue, or, in semi-Pelagian fashion, ascribe to man the power to attain a degree of readiness to receive salvation. Legacy and monastery Macarius is a saint in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. In the Methodist Churches, Macarius is regarded highly for writing on the topic of entire sanctification. Macarius of Egypt founded a monastery that bears his name, the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, which has been continuously inhabited by monks since its foundation in the fourth century. St. Macarius‚Äô face used to be enlightened with grace in an amazing way to the extent that many fathers testified that his face used to glow in the dark; and thus appeared his name as ‚Äúthe glowing lantern.‚Äù This description was transferred to his monastery, and thus it was called ‚Äúthe glowing lantern of the wilderness‚Äù or ‚Äúthe glowing monastery,‚Äù which meant the place of high wisdom and constant prayer. Today it belongs to the Coptic Orthodox Church. The entirety of the Nitrian Desert is sometimes called the Desert of Macarius, for he was the pioneer monk in the region. The ruins of numerous monasteries in this region almost confirm the local tradition that the cloisters of Macarius were equal in number to the days of the year.  Saint Macarius Depicted on the Camposanto Fresco in Pisa  Saint Macarius The Great, Camposanto, Trionfo Della Morte Saint Macarius the Great, one of the Egyptian desert recluses and a disciple of Saint Anthony the Great, is depicted on the right edge of the Triumph of Death fresco in Pisa. A group of leisurely aristocrats and their animals occupy the central part of the fresco. These rich young men and women riding horses, surrounded by their decorative hunting dogs have gone on a pleasant journey. Suddenly, their path, somewhere deep in the woods, is barred by three open sarcophagi with bodies in different degrees of decomposition. Everybody in the scene, including the men, women and even the animals are horrified by this terrible and palpable presence of death. The unsupportable stench hits their noses. The abhorrent scene dismays them. Only Saint Macarius the Great, made wise and powerful by his faith, stands above them all. The mystic Saint teaches the youngsters a lesson about life and death by reading from the scroll. The Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini was inspired by this depiction of Saint Macarius in his painted portrait.

He was a slightly younger contemporary of Macarius of Egypt, and is thus also known as Macarius the Younger. Life Macarius was born about the year 300 in Alexandria. He was a merchant until the age of 40, when he was baptized and went off into the desert. After several years of ascetic life, he was ordained a presbyter and appointed prior of a monastery known as the \\"Kellii\\", or \\"cells\\" in the Egyptian desert, between the Nitria mountain and a skete in which monastic hermits lived in silence, each in his own cell.\\"St. Macarius of Alexandria\\", St. John's Orthodox Church About the year 335, Macarius of Alexandria retired to live alone as a recluse in el- Natroun desert. Many miracles were ascribed to him. He presided over five thousand Nitric monks. Having learned of the extremely strict rule for monastic life observed at the Tabbenesiot Monastery, whose prior was Venerable St. Pachomios the Great (+ 348), St. Macarius disguised himself in secular clothing, and over the course of the entire Quadragesima [the 40-day Great Lent] neither ate bread nor drank water. No one saw him eating or sitting down. He was making baskets of palm leaves while he was standing. The monks said to Saint Pachomius: \\"Cast out this man from here, for he is not human.\\" A divine inspiration subsequently revealed Macarius' identity to him, and the monks rushed to receive his blessings. Having demonstrated humility and taught a lesson to all, St. Macarius returned to his own monastery. At the age of 73 Macarius of Alexandria was exiled by Emperor Valens, along with Macarius of Egypt to an island, which they subsequently Christianized. According to Eastern Orthodox tradition, Macarius of Alexandria died on 2 January 395. According to the Coptic Orthodox tradition, he died on 1 May 395. (6 Pashons, 111 A.M.) In addition to a monastic rule and three brief apothegms, a homily \\"On the End of the Souls of the Righteous and of Sinners\\" is ascribed to him, although excellent Vienna manuscripts assign the latter to a monk named Alexander. Palladius and Sozomen also mention a Macarius the Younger of Lower Egypt, who lived in a cell for more than twenty three years to atone for a murder which he had committed.

It drains approximately of Curry County. Flowing through a rugged and isolated coastal region, it descends rapidly from about to sea level at the Pacific Ocean. Except for the lowermost , the river is located entirely within the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. The river rises in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, northwest of Chetco Peak at the junction of the Oregon Coast Range and the Klamath Mountains. It flows generally north, west, and then southwest, before emptying into the ocean between Brookings and Harbor, approximately north of the California state line. The Chetco River's watershed remains largely undeveloped, protected by the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The upper of the river have been designated Wild and Scenic since 1988. Native Americans have lived in the Chetco River's watershed for the last one to three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19th centuries, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water. Supporting a large population of salmon and trout, the Chetco's water is of very high quality. The watershed is home to many other species, including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area. The northernmost grove of Redwoods‚Äîthe tallest trees on Earth‚Äîgrow in the southern region of the Chetco's drainage basin. In total, the river is home to over 200 species of animals, and 97 percent of the watershed is forested. Course The Chetco River begins about east of Chetco Peak, approximately above sea level. It flows north, gathering small tributaries such as the Little Chetco River and Babyfoot Creek. The river turns west near the Pearsoll Peak, the highest point in the watershed. It receives Box Canyon Creek on the left bank, Tincup Creek on the right bank, and Boulder Creek on the left. It then flows south, gathering the South Fork Chetco River. A few miles farther south, the river passes through a Redwood grove. It flows between Bosley Butte to the north and Mount Emily to the south; the latter is the impact site of one of only four bombs known to have been dropped in the continental United States by an enemy aircraft. This occurred during the Lookout Air Raids of 1942. Turning southwest, the river flows through Alfred A. Loeb State Park and collects the North Fork Chetco River on the right at river mile (RM) 5 (or river kilometer (RK) 8). The Chetco becomes an estuary about from its mouth. It passes through the communities of Brookings to the north and Harbor to the south, and discharges into the Pacific Ocean. Discharge The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of the Chetco River at a stream gauge at RM 10.7 (RK 17.2), which is northeast of Brookings. It opened in 1969, and continues to operate. The average flow was from a drainage area of , about 77 percent of the Chetco's total drainage basin. The maximum recorded flow was on December 22, 1964, during the Pacific Northwest flood of 1964. The minimum flow was on October 14, 1987. Watershed alt=A small stream flows through steep and forested hills below a blue sky with several white clouds. The Chetco River drains of the southern Oregon Coast. About 78 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service, and another 5 percent is owned by the Bureau of Land Management. Sixteen percent is privately owned, while the remaining one percent is managed by the cities of Brookings and Harbor, Curry County, and the state of Oregon. Approximately 97 percent of the land is used for forestry, 2 percent for agriculture and rural areas, and 1 percent is urban. Gravel and minerals are mined from the lower and upper regions of the watershed, respectively. The region is mostly mountainous, characterized by steep river valleys. Elevations in the Chetco River watershed range from sea level to at the summit of Pearsoll Peak. Precipitation averages between per year, with October through June being the wettest months. Seventy percent of surface runoff is collected from rain, and 30 percent from rain on snow. Twenty-five separate wetlands totaling have been identified in the watershed. Temperatures average between , although the Brookings effect (or Chetco effect; similar to a foehn wind) often brings localized hot weather to the Brookings area. The increase in temperature is caused by the geography of the region; cool air funnels down the Chetco River valley from the Siskiyou and Coast ranges, gradually heating up before eventually reaching Brookings as a warm wind. The mountains also shield the area from cool marine layers. Partially as a result of this phenomenon, Brookings recorded its highest temperature ever, , on July 8, 2008. Earthquakes are common, and large-scale ones occur around every 300 years. The Cascadia earthquake of 1700‚Äîestimated at 8.7‚Äì9.2 on the moment magnitude scale‚Äîcaused a tsunami to sweep across California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, reaching Japan the next day. It was produced when the entire Cascadia subduction zone, about long, slipped approximately in a megathrust event. Another major earthquake occurred in 1873 near present-day Brookings. With a magnitude of 7.3, the quake was felt from Seattle to San Francisco. Wind is also a factor in the region; storms can sometimes reach over . The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 brought devastating winds to nearly all of Oregon; nearby Port Orford recorded gusts exceeding . The storm killed 38 people across the state and caused over $200 million worth of damage. The watershed often experiences wildfires, some of them major. The Biscuit Fire of 2002 burned over of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and surrounding regions. As of the 2010 census, the city of Brookings had a population of 6,336, while nearby Harbor had 2,391. In total, over 14,000 residents of the Brookings‚ÄìHarbor area depend on the Chetco River for drinking water. Nearby watersheds include the Winchuck and Smith rivers to the south, the Pistol River to the north, and the Illinois River, a tributary of the Rogue River, to the north and east. Flora and fauna The rare alt=A cluster of pink flowers that have five overlapping petals. Two in the foreground are focused, while numerous flowers and small leaves in the background are blurry. Each flower has many long, black stamens that are as long as their petals. The Chetco River watershed is covered primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes species such as Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles. The most prevalent species of the extreme southern portion of the watershed is the coastal redwood, one of the tallest types of trees on Earth. The world's northernmost redwood grove is located near the south bank of the Chetco at RM 15 (RK 24), about north of the California border. Trees here are around 300 to 800 years old, in diameter, and some exceed tall. The redwoods were heavily logged in the early 20th century. Prior to logging, the massive trees created their own microclimate by capturing moisture from fog, and also by the immense amount of shade they produced. The redwoods region is less mountainous than the rest of the watershed, and meandering streams are much more common. Over 200 species of animals inhabit the river and its tributaries. Birds such as loons, grebes, ducks, kingfishers, and bald eagles are known to live around streams and other regions of the watershed. Auks, gulls, and terns have been spotted around the river's mouth, and black-legged kittiwakes nest in the area during the winter. The wildlife in the Kalmiopsis region of the Chetco watershed is more diverse than that of any other region in Oregon. Mammals such as American black bears, black-tailed deer, bobcats, ring-tailed cats, and gray foxes are common inhabitants of this region. The rare Siskiyou chipmunk is endemic to the Klamath Mountains. Steelhead and chinook and coho salmon are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit the Chetco River. Steelhead are abundant and have been spotted in most major and minor streams. Chinook salmon usually travel as far as Boulder Creek, about halfway between the Chetco's headwaters and its mouth. Coho also generally stay in this area, but some have been found in the Granite and Carter Creek area, about above Boulder Creek. Coastal cutthroat trout can be found all around the watershed; some migrate to the ocean, while others live in the river and its tributaries year round. Pacific lamprey, three-spined stickleback, and various sculpins have also been observed. Geology A sample of alt=A rough surfaced rock covered in olive green, white, and black specks. A vertical black stripe runs through the center. The Chetco River flows through the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100 million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath microcontinent was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating hundreds of millions of years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170 million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165 million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle. The mountainous terrain of the Chetco River watershed was created approximately 130 million years ago when the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today. Today, sandstone, shale, granite, and serpentine are the primary rock types in the Chetco region. Various forms of loam comprise its soil. Erosion levels are high due to a combination of high precipitation, steep slopes, and landslides, which can result in earthflows. History alt=Man with high forehead and short pointed beard, in dark clothing which incorporates a shining leather or metallic collar. His right hand is resting on a globe of the world. Humans have lived in the Chetco River watershed since approximately 1,000 to 3,000 years ago. The first inhabitants were perhaps ancestors of the Chetco Indians and other Native American tribes, themselves descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia over 10,000 years ago. At least nine separate villages were constructed along the Chetco River, including two on either side of its mouth. The Native Americans named the river \\"chit taa-ghii~-li~'\\". The first European American to visit the area may have been Sir Francis Drake on June 5, 1579, during his circumnavigation of the world. The Vancouver Expedition also explored the area in 1792. In June 1828 Jedediah Smith and his company of fur traders camped on the south bank of the river near a Native American village. Between 1853 and 1855, many Native Americans were killed and their villages destroyed in skirmishes occurring around the same time as the nearby Rogue River Wars. On July 9, 1856, the remaining Chetco were marched north to the Siletz Reservation. Oregon‚Äîand therefore the Chetco watershed‚Äîwas jointly occupied by the United Kingdom and the United States after the Treaty of 1818 was signed. The Oregon Treaty was ratified in 1846, giving the United States ownership of Oregon. Soon after, the Oregon Territory was established, and Oregon became a U.S. state on February 14, 1859. The discovery of gold and other precious metals in the watershed brought settlers to the region in the 1840s and 1850s. Nickel, cobalt, and chromium were also mined. The town of Harbor was founded on the south bank of the Chetco River in 1891, and a ferry service across the river opened in 1904. It was shut down in 1915 when the Chetco Bridge opened. In 1912, the Brookings Lumber & Box Company moved north from the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California to the southern Oregon coast region. The company constructed a sawmill in 1914, and founded the town of Brookings. Brookings was not incorporated until 1951. The region remained relatively isolated due to its mountainous terrain until 1924, when Highway 101 was extended from Crescent City, California, to Brookings. In 1932, the Isaac Lee Patterson Bridge was completed over the Rogue River to the north, connecting the region to the rest of the Oregon coast. In 1917, a wharf was built at the mouth of the river. Jetties were constructed on either side of its mouth by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1957. The Siskiyou National Forest was created on October 5, 1906, protecting the entire upper portion of the Chetco watershed. The nearby Rogue River National Forest was combined with it in 2004, creating the nearly Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. In 1964, the United States Congress set aside over of the eastern Chetco River watershed and surrounding regions to create the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The wilderness was expanded several times in the 1970s, and now encompasses over . alt=An aerial image of southern Oregon and northern California. The Pacific Ocean is to the west, while the circular Crater Lake and Upper Klamath Lake are visible to the east. Fires are outlined in red. The Biscuit Fire‚Äîlocated in the southwestern corner‚Äîforms a large irregular ring shape, and a massive gray smoke plume rises from it. The smoke is drifting southwest over the ocean.Another smaller fire is located to the northeast. On October 28, 1988, a stretch of the Chetco River was designated a National Wild and Scenic River, from its headwaters to the boundary of the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. In a court case in 1994, the Chetco was determined to be navigable. In 2002, over of the eastern portion of the watershed and surrounding regions were destroyed in the Biscuit Fire. Originally five separate fires, it was caused by several lightning strikes between July 12 and 15. By August 17, all five had burned together, creating one massive fire. It burned for over five months and was not fully extinguished until December 31. In 2002, of land on the Little Chetco River were sold to Washington real estate developer David Rutan, only several months after the Biscuit Fire tore through the region. He opened a gold mining camp on the site in 2007, flying in customers by helicopter. Curry County officials soon stated that the camp violated zoning and sanitation laws, but inspections were stymied because of the area's inaccessibility. Rutan bought several more claims in the Wild and Scenic section of the Chetco River in the following years, beginning inside the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, and ending downstream. Despite environmentalists' concerns, he proposed mining the Chetco riverbed for gold and minerals via commercial suction dredges, permitted by the General Mining Act of 1872. In 2010, the Chetco River was identified as the seventh most endangered river in America by advocacy organization American Rivers, facing a threat of \\"motorized instream mining\\". Oregon's governor, Ted Kulongoski, two senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and congressman Peter DeFazio all asked the United States Department of Agriculture to withdraw the Chetco River from the 1872 Mining Act, thus preventing mineral mining on the river. However, Rutan forfeited his claims by not paying his annual filing fees to the Bureau of Land Management in 2011.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has monitored the Chetco River for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The Chetco from Box Canyon Creek to its mouth exceeded the standard level for temperature and turbidity. The North Fork, South Fork, and other tributaries were also listed for temperature and turbidity. All tributaries of the Chetco usually exceed the temperature standard. Water temperatures range from at Bosley Creek to at Willow Bar. High turbidity levels in the Chetco River watershed are usually caused by landslides, various forms of erosion, and plugged road culverts. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Chetco River at RM 10.8 (RK 17.4) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 (excellent) in the summer and 90 in the fall, winter, and spring. These scores are comparable to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93. Despite the excellent ratings, the Chetco River actually ranks as the second most polluted stream in Curry County, after nearby Floras Creek, a tributary of the New River. Recreation Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are the primary recreational activities in the watershed. Whitewater kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high. Several trails are maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, as well as other regions in the watershed. Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south fork and its mouth. Alfred A. Loeb State Park, located on the banks of the Chetco, has three cabins and 48 camping sites. Several large parks are located in Brookings. The Azalea Park in Brookings features five species of wild azaleas. The park was designated an Oregon State Park in 1939, but was given to Brookings in 1993. It hosts the American Music Festival from June until September. The Nature's Coastal Holiday light show is displayed in Azalea Park every December. Chetco Point Park, located near the wharf, has several fire rings and picnic tables, as well as views of the river, the Pacific Ocean, and the Port of Brookings Harbor. It is home to the rare Wolf's Evening Primrose.

Blondel (Paris, 1876). This work (called in Greek; Apocriticus in Latin) agrees in its dogmatics with Gregory of Nyssa, and is valuable on account of the numerous excerpts from the writings of the opponent of Macarius. These fragments are apparently drawn from the lost Against the Christians of Porphyry or from the Lover of Truth of Hierocles. He may be the Macarius, bishop of Magnesia, who, at the Synod of the Oak in 403, brought charges against Heraclides, bishop of Ephesus, the friend of John Chrysostom, although Adolf Harnack dated him in the late third century. Like Macarius the Younger, this Macarius is frequently confused with Macarius of Egypt. References Sources *A.

He is recognized as a saint within the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Athanasius, in one of his orations against Arianism, refers to Macarius as an example of \\"the honest and simple style of apostolical men.\\" The date 312 for Macarius's accession to the episcopate is found in Jerome's version of Eusebius of Caesarea's Chronicle.Tillemont, M√©moires... About 325 he accompanied Helena Augusta, the mother of Constantine I in her search at Jerusalem for relics of the Passion of Jesus, including the cross on which Jesus of Nazareth was thought to have been crucified. According to Eusebius, he received a long letter from Constantine with reference to the building of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem: \\"Such is our Saviour's grace, that no power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration ... And as to the columns and marbles, whatever you shall judge, after actual inspection of the plan, to be especially precious and serviceable, be diligent to send information to us in writing, in order that whatever quantity or sort of materials we shall esteem from your letter to be needful, may be procured from every quarter, as required, for it is fitting that the most marvelous place in the world should be worthily decorated.\\"Eusebius, Vita Constantini, III, 30-32. Macarius is listed as one of the bishops to whom Pope Alexander of Alexandria wrote warning against Arius.Epiphanius, \\"H√¶r.\\", LXIX, iv. His death must have been before the Council of Tyre, in 335, at which his successor, Maximus, was apparently one of the bishops present. Macarius and Arianism Macarius took part in the Council of Nicaea (325), and two conjectures as to the part he played there are worth mentioning. The first is that there was a passage of arms between him and his metropolitan, Eusebius of Caesarea, concerning the rights of their respective sees. The seventh canon of the council ‚Äî \\"As custom and ancient tradition show that the bishop of √Ülia [Jerusalem] ought to be honoured, he shall have precedence; without prejudice, however, to the dignity which belongs to the Metropolis\\" ‚Äî by its vagueness suggests that it was the result of a drawn battle. The second conjecture is that Macarius, together with Eustathius of Antioch, had a good deal to do with the drafting of the Nicene Creed finally adopted by the First Council of Nic√¶a in 325.For the grounds of this conjecture (expressions in the Creed recalling those of Jerusalem and Antioch) the reader may consult Hort, \\"Two Dissertations\\", etc., 58 sqq.; Harnack, \\"Dogmengesch.\\", II (3rd edition), 231; Kattenbusch, \\"Das Apost. Symbol.\\" (See index in vol. II.) The vigour of his opposition to the theology of Arianism is suggested by the abusive manner in which Arius writes of him in his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia.Theodoret, \\"H. E.\\", I, 4. In the \\"History of the Council of Nic√¶a\\" attributed to Gelasius of Cyzicus there are a number of imaginary disputations between Fathers of the Council and philosophers in the pay of Arius. In one of these disputes where Macarius is spokesman for the bishops he defends the Descent into Hell. This, in view of the question whether the Descent into Hell was found in the Jerusalem Creed, is notable, especially as in other respects Macarius's language is made conformable to that Creed.cf Hahn, \\"Symbole\\", 133. Macarius's name appears first among those of the bishops of Palestine who subscribed to the Council of Nic√¶a; that of Eusebius comes fifth. Athanasius, in his encyclical letter to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, places the name of Macarius (who had been long dead at that time) among those bishops renowned for their orthodoxy. SozomenH. E., II, 20. narrates that Macarius appointed Maximus, who afterwards succeeded him, Bishop of Lydia, and that the appointment did not take effect because the people of Jerusalem refused to part with Maximus. He also gives another version of the story, to the effect that Macarius himself changed his mind, fearing that, if Maximus was out of the way, an unorthodox bishop would be appointed to succeed him (Macarius). Tillemont discredits this story: Macarius by so acting would have contravened the seventh canon of Nic√¶a and Aetius, who at the time of the council was Bishop of Lydda, was certainly alive in 331, and very probably in 349.Louis-S√©bastien Le Nain de Tillemont, M√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire eccl√©siastique des six premiers si√®cles, VI, 741. Of course, if Aetius outlived Macarius, the story breaks down; but if he died shortly after 331, it seems plausible enough. The fact that Macarius was then nearing his end would explain the reluctance, whether on his part or that of his flock, to be deprived of Maximus. Tillemont's first objection carries no weight. The seventh canon was too vague to secure from an orthodox bishop like Macarius very strict views as to the metropolitan rights of a Semi-Arian like Eusebius. Macarius and the Holy Sites Theophanes (d. 818) in his Chronography makes Constantine, at the end of the Council of Nic√¶a, order Macarius to search for the sites of the Resurrection and the Passion, and the True Cross. It is likely that this is what happened, for excavations were begun very soon after the council, and, it would seem under the superintendence of Macarius. The huge mound and stonework with the temple of Venus on the top, which in the time of Hadrian had been piled up over the Holy Sepulchre, were demolished, and \\"when the original surface of the ground appeared, forthwith, contrary to all expectation, the hallowed monument of our Saviour's Resurrection was discovered\\".Euseb., Vit. Const., III, 28. On hearing the news Constantine wrote to Macarius giving lavish orders for the erection of a church on the site.Euseb., Ib., III, 30; Theodoret, H. E., I, 16. Later on, he wrote another letter \\"To Macarius and the rest of the Bishops of Palestine\\" ordering a church to be built at Mambre, which also had been defiled by a pagan shrine. Eusebius, though he gives the superscription as above, speaks of this letter as \\"addressed to me\\", thinking, perhaps of his metropolitan dignity (Vit. Const., III, 51-53). Churches were also built on the sites of the Nativity and Ascension. Veneration Macarius is recognised as a saint within the Orthodox and Catholic traditions. Relics of Saint Macarius, including his skull, are located in Saint Anthony's Chapel (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

It drains part of the Klamath Mountains in northern California and southwestern Oregon. The river's main stem begins at the confluence of its east and west forks near Cave Junction in southern Josephine County. Its drainage basin includes Sucker Creek, which rises in the Red Buttes Wilderness, near Whiskey Peak on the California state line. The main stem flows generally northwest in a winding course past Kerby and through the Siskiyou National Forest and Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It joins the Rogue River from the south at Agness on the Curry-Josephine county line, from the Pacific Ocean. The river's lower , from where it enters the Rogue River‚ÄìSiskiyou National Forest downstream from Kerby to its confluence with the Rogue River, were designated Wild and Scenic in 1984. Of this, is protected as wild, as scenic, and as recreational. Tributaries Sucker Creek is named after the state of Illinois, one of whose nicknames is the Sucker State. Miners from Illinois named the creek. In 2011, the United States Forest Service worked on a project to improve the creek. The project is a fishery rehabilitation project. Rafting and kayaking Illinois River Rafters The Illinois River is \\"a wilderness river that tests both the skill and strength of boaters\\". For the run along the Wild and Scenic part of the river between upper Oak Flat near Kerby and lower Oak Flat, boaters are far from trails and roads. In fact, it is \\"the most inaccessible river canyon in the lower 48 states...\\" with sections that are inaccessible, even by trail. Depending on the water flow, this stretch of the river has eight class IV to IV+ rapids. Green Wall, a class V, \\"is considerably more difficult and longer than the others\\" and below it lie of difficult rapids. The river is generally run by raft or kayak during the rainy season, October through April. At flows below , boating is difficult because of exposed rocks, and flows above \\"turn the river into boiling holes and rapids.\\" A heavy rain can turn an ordinary trip into a high-water nightmare. Permits from the U.S. Forest Service are required (year round) for river trips on the Wild Section of the river (between Briggs Creek and Nancy Creek) and groups are limited to no more than twelve. However, the permits for non-commercial groups are free and are self issued 24/7, but the permit must also be deposited at Oak Flat to verify the safe completion of the trip. Since there is no dam on the Illinois River, river flows are highly dependent upon weather conditions. Changing weather can often result in water levels being too high or too low for safe and successful navigation. Furthermore, since water levels can rise rapidly, potential bad weather can also be the cause for cancelled or postponed trips.

Oxford Dictionary of Art First School of Fontainebleau (from 1531) Diana the Huntress - School of Fontainebleau, 1550‚Äì1560, (Louvre) In 1531, the Florentine artist Rosso Fiorentino, having lost most of his possessions at the Sack of Rome in 1527, was invited by Fran√ßois I to come to France, where he began an extensive decorative program for the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, Francesco Primaticcio (from Bologna). Rosso died in France in 1540. On the advice of Primaticcio, Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate (from Modena) was invited to France in 1552 by Fran√ßois's son Henri II. Although known for their work at Fontainebleau, these artists were also invited to create works of art for other noble families of the period and were much esteemed and well-paid. The works of this \\"first school of Fontainebleau\\" are characterized by the extensive use of stucco (moldings and picture frames) and frescos, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of allegories and mythological iconography. Renaissance decorative motifs such as grotesques, strapwork and putti are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism. The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian Mannerism of Michelangelo, Raphael and especially Parmigianino. Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique Roman statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary. Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and dell'Abate have not survived; parts of the Chateau were remodelled at various dates. The paintings of the group were reproduced in prints, mostly etchings, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris. These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived. The mannerist style of the Fontainebleau school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter Jean Cousin the Elder, the sculptors Jean Goujon and Germain Pilon, and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist Fran√ßois Clouet the son of Jean Clouet. Printmaking workshop Etching by Antonio Fantuzzi, copying a drawing for this stucco and paint surround at the Palace of Fontainebleau Although there is no certain proof, most scholars have agreed that there was a printmaking workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself, reproducing the designs of the artists for their works in the palace, as well as other compositions they produced. The most productive printmakers were L√©on Davent, Antonio Fantuzzi, and Jean Mignon, followed by the \\"mysterious\\" artist known from his monogram as \\"Master I‚ôÄV\\" (‚ôÄ being the alchemical symbol for copper, from which the printing plates were made),Jacobson, 80-83 and the workshop seems to have been active between about 1542 and 1548 at the latest; Fran√ßois I died in March 1547, after which funding for the palace ended, and the school dispersed. These were the first etchings made in France, and not far behind the first Italian uses of the technique, which originated in Germany.Jacobson, 80-81; Landau, 308-309 The earliest impressions of all the Fontainebleau prints are in brown ink, and their intention seems to have been essentially reproductive.Jacobson, 80-81 The Enlightenment of Francois I by Rosso Fiorentino, and its surround in the Gallery of Francois I in the palace. A preparatory drawing is copied in the print above. The intention of the workshop was to disseminate the new style developing at the palace more widely, both to France and to the Italians' peers back in Italy. Whether the initiative to do this came from the king or another patron, or from the artists alone, is unclear. David Landau believes that Primaticcio was the driving force;Jacobson, 95; Landau, 309 he had stepped up to become the director of the work at Fontainebleau after the suicide of Rosso Fiorentino in 1540.Jacobson, 79 The enterprise seems to have been \\"just slightly premature\\" in terms of catching a market. The etched prints were often marked by signs of the workshop's inexperience and sometimes incompetence with the technique of etching, and according to Sue Welsh Reed: \\"Few impressions survive from these plates, and it is questionable whether many were pulled. The plates were often poorly executed and not well printed; they were often scratched or not well polished and did not wipe clean. Some may have been made of metals soft as copper, such as pewter.\\"Reed, 27 A broadening market for prints preferred the \\"highly finished textures\\" of Nicolas Beatrizet, and later \\"proficient but ultimately uninspired\\" engravers such as Ren√© Boyvin and Pierre Milan.Landau, 309 Notable artists of the first school *Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate (c.1509‚Äì1571) (Italian) *Damiano del Barbiere, Italian stuccoist and sculptor *Francesco Scibec da Carpi (died c. 1557) Italian furniture maker, who worked on the boiseries. *L√©on Davent, French etcher *Antonio Fantuzzi, Italian painter and etcher *Rosso Fiorentino (Giovanni Battista di Jacopo de' Rossi) (1494‚Äì1540) (Italian) *Juste de Juste (c.1505‚Äì1559) Franco-Italian sculptor and etcher *Luca Penni (c. 1500/1504‚Äì1556) (Italian) *Francesco Primaticcio (c.1505‚Äì1570) (Italian) *L√©onard Thiry, Flemish, painter and etcher Second School of Fontainebleau (from 1594) Portrait of Gabrielle d'Estr√©es and Duchess of Villars, School of Fontainebleau, c.1594 From 1584 to 1594, during the Wars of Religion the ch√¢teau of Fontainebleau was abandoned. Upon his accession to the throne, Henri IV undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born Ambroise Dubois (from Antwerp) and the Parisians Toussaint Dubreuil and Martin Fr√©minet. They are sometimes referred to as the \\"second school of Fontainebleau\\". Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continue in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions. Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian Torquato Tasso and the ancient Greek novelist Heliodorus of Emesa. Their style continued to have an influence on artists through the first decades of the 17th century, but other artistic currents (Peter Paul Rubens, Caravaggio, the Dutch and Flemish naturalist schools) soon eclipsed them.

It drains a mountainous area of of the Southern Oregon Coast Range into the Pacific Ocean. Its watershed is between that of the Coos River to the north and the Rogue River to the south. Course The river, formed by the confluence of its north and south forks, begins at Myrtle Point. The North Fork Coquille River, about long), rises in northern Coos County and flows southwest. The East Fork Coquille River, about long, rises in eastern Coos County, and flows generally west to join the North Fork. The South Fork, about long, rises in southern Coos County, north of the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area, and flows generally north. It receives the Middle Fork Coquille River, about long, then joins the North Fork from the south at Myrtle Point. The combined river meanders generally west, past Coquille. It enters the Pacific at Bandon, about north of Cape Blanco. Just before emptying in the Pacific, it is crossed by [US Route 101] via a relatively small [drawbridge] called [Bullards_Bridge]. http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/Planning/cctsp03-28-11.pdf Tributaries Named tributaries of the Coquille River from source to mouth are the North Fork and South Fork followed by Grady, Hall, Gray, Fishtrap, Glen Aiken, Pulaski, Rink, Fat Elk, Calloway, and China creeks. Next come Beaver, Iowa, and Hatchet sloughs followed by Alder, Lampa, Lowe, and Bear creeks. Further downstream Offield Creek enters via Randolph Slough. Then come Sevenmile and Fahys creeks followed by Peterson Gulch. Below that are Spring, Simpson, and Ferry creeks. The map includes mile markers along the main stem and each large Coquille River fork. Tidal effect The Coquille River is a tidal-effect river. During high tides at sea, the water at the mouth of the river acts like a dam, impeding the flow of the stream. More water always flows out into the ocean than enters with the tide; however, logs, sticks, and leaves on the surface can float upriver at certain times of day. There is a time lag between the high tide at sea and the effect pushing upstream. This varies according to the number of miles from the ocean. The tidal-effect is observed as far as Myrtle Point, some upriver. The head of tide is upriver from the mouth at Bandon. But some salt water does enter across the bar. The salt water intrusion was once minor. Today, however, sometimes traces of salinity appear only a few miles below the town of Coquille. This phenomenon affects industry along the river, as mills and other sites need fresh water intakes on the river in order not to rust or damage equipment or affect production processes. On its main forks, the Coquille is also an alluvial river valley, meaning it was once a drowned river valley‚Äîa lake, or perhaps a much wider river, with a sandy bottom. The soil in the valley is very fertile. However, the rise and fall of the water level, and flooding in winter, prevent ordinary types of farming. A lush grass grows in the valley lowlands which can survive either drought or inundation. Tide-gates along the river can bring in water when needed. On this sweeping stand of grass, in summer many cattle find pasture. Oregon Water Resources Department Watermaster District 19 covers the Coquille River system. History In its natural state, the Coquille River meandered widely at its mouth. Owing to storms, tides, or other conditions, the river could empty into the sea as far north as a beach now called Whiskey Run, or as far south as a rock formation called Table Rock‚Äîan overall distance of several miles. It is said that when early sailing vessels tried to cross the dangerous bar to return to the port at Bandon, the main channel might have moved, or shoaled in, at the very place the ships had crossed safely on the outgoing journey. Coquille River LighthouseCaptain Judah Parker, a sea captain, built a jetty of bunches of cedar branches wrapped in burlap, sunken into the mud. Rocks were added. In the late 1890s, the government built jetties to force the channel to stay put. Huge boulders for the South Jetty, at Bandon, came from the blasting of a nearby mound of rock called Tupper Rock. The North Jetty is across the river, and clearly visible from the south jetty. The Coquille River Lighthouse,http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=127 lighthousefriends.com commissioned in 1896, guided mariners to find the dangerous bar at the mouth of the Coquille. The lighthouse was built on or near Rackleff Rock, a rocky obstacle in the channel. The rock became part of the bulwark of the North Jetty area. The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1939, following the last of improvements to the river channel. The pioneer Hamblock and Bullards families had ranches in that region. But eventually their lands became part of the present Bullards Beach State Park. The old lighthouse building still stands. It is now a tourist attraction. Literary setting In his early science fiction book The Begum's Millions, Jules Verne depicted a fictional Utopian community named Ville-France being created in 1872 at the Coquille River's confluence with the Pacific, slightly south-west of the actual site of Bandon.

About 1645 he studied at Athens with the Neo-Aristotelian philosopher and scholar Theophilos Corydalleus. Early in 1661 he was in Constantinople on business connected with his monastery, and on his return to Sinai he was chosen abbot (25-1-1661). However, on his way to Jerusalem to be consecrated, he was informed that he had been chosen Patriarch of the Holy City, and was consecrated on April 9, 1661. As he was fond of learning and of music, he arranged for the establishment of schools in Constantinople, in Arta and Chios. In addition, he repaired the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and cared for the reconstruction of monastic houses and guest houses for visitors there. When he was present in Ia»ôi, the capital of Moldavia, he became involved with the issues surrounding Patriarch Nikon of Moscow and all the Rus'. In July 1663, when Pantaleon Ligarid and Archbishop Josef of Astrakhan tried to officially depose Patriarch Nikon from his cathedra, Patriarch Nectarius of Jerusalem protested in 1664 against their intended trial of Patriarch Nikon, because he saw no serious basis for it. He also knew Ligarid well, considering him a rogue.Daniel Shubin. A History of Russian Christianity. Algora Publishing, 2004. p. 119.

He participated in the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672, that refuted the Calvinist confessions of Cyril Lucaris. After his resignation, Nectarius remained in Jerusalem, except for a short time when he was driven to Mount Sinai by Latin monks who came to Palestine with Roman Catholic crusaders. Later he remained at the Monastery of The Holy Archangels (Andromedos, Joppa) until his death. Patriarch Nectarius died on July 14, 1676. Writings Patriarch Nectarius was versed in the Greek, Arabic, Turkish, and Latin languages. During his patriarchate, Romish emissaries were very active in endeavoring to persuade the Greek Christians of Palestine, suffering under the yoke of the Turks, to unite with the Church of Rome. Among them a Franciscan, named Peter, was especially active in distributing five tracts in defense of the papal authority. Nectarius' refutation of these tracts regarding papal supremacy was among the most important of his writings, in a publication entitled: ŒöŒ±œÑŒ¨ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºÄœÅœá·øÜœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ†Œ±œÄ·æ∂, a firm refutation of the Roman Catholic theses. He also wrote a work in Greek against the doctrines of Luther and Calvin, which was translated into Latin by Renaudot, who published it, together with Gennadius' Homilies on the Eucharist.(Paris, 1709, 4to). In his doctrine of the Eucharist, Nectarius was strictly Orthodox, and a zealous opponent of Cyril Lucaris and the Calvinistic movement. In addition, Nectarius is said to have written a history of the Egyptian empire down to Sultan Selim. In this Arabic manuscript (which he composed in Greek), he states that he personally witnessed a miracle in the region of Heliopolis, Egypt, similar to the narrative of The Valley of Dry Bones, (Ezekiel 37:1-14) in which the prophet sees the dead rise again.The Rudder (Pƒìd√°lion): Of the metaphorical ship of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of the Orthodox Christians, or all the sacred and divine canons of the holy and renowned Apostles, of the holy Councils, ecumenical as well as regional, and of individual fathers, as embodied in the original Greek text, for the sake of authenticity, and explained in the vernacular by way of rendering them more intelligible to the less educated. :Comp.

On August 28, 2020 Birdstone was pensioned from stud duty to Old Friends Retirement Farm in Georgetown,Kentucky where he will be accessible to his fans from all over the world.  Background  Owned and bred by Marylou Whitney of Whitney family racing fame, Birdstone was sired by Grindstone, winner of the 1996 Kentucky Derby, who in turn was sired by Unbridled, who won the 1990 Kentucky Derby. Unbridled was in turn sired by Fappiano, a son of Mr. Prospector, the tail-male ancestor of the vast majority of winners of Triple Crown races in recent years (22 out of the 24 races 1998-2005). Birdstone's dam, Dear Birdie, was 2004 Broodmare of the Year, and produced 12 stakes winning foals, including Bird Town (by Cape Town), who won the 2003 Kentucky Oaks. Bird Town would later go on to produce graded stakes winner Bird Song (by Unbridled's Song).  Racing career  As a juvenile, Birdstone won the Champagne Stakes, a leading race for two-year-olds, at Belmont Park in 2003. Beginning his sophomore season, Birdstone won an allowance and finished fifth in the Lane's End Stakes. He was not a factor in the first two Triple Crown races (finishing eighth in the Kentucky Derby and skipping the Preakness Stakes) and was a 36-1 longshot when he upset the overwhelmingly favored Smarty Jones, taking the lead in the final furlong (201 m) in the fastest Belmont Stakes since the advent of modern electronic timing (2002 was the first year times were kept to hundredths). Birdstone's victory represented the first in the Belmont for trainer Nick Zito, whose horses had finished second in that classic five times. In the winner's circle after the Belmont Stakes, his owners apologized to the connections of Smarty Jones for winning, as did jockey Edgar Prado. The next major race for Birdstone was the Travers Stakes, which he won being the fourth betting choice at 5-1. He was Zito's first Travers champion.  Retirement and Stud Career  Birdstone's retirement from racing after suffering a bone chip at the Breeders' Cup was announced on November 4, 2004. He began his career as a stallion at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. His first starter was the colt Shoe Strap (Birdstone - Boot Strap by Storm Boot), who first went to post on May 21, 2008, at Churchill Downs and was trained by D. Wayne Lukas.Who U Like? Shoe Strap? - Maiden Watch From his first crop of foals to race, Birdstone sired Mine That Bird, who had several wins as a two-year-old gelding before winning the 2009 Kentucky Derby as a three-year-old. Another of Birdstone's top runners was Summer Bird, who upset Mine That Bird in the 2009 Belmont Stakes (later winning the Jockey Club Gold Cup). His first crop also included Birdrun, who set the Belmont track record at a mile and a sixteenth . Birdstone was one of the top ten ranked freshman sires of 2008 with 11 winners out of 22 starters and stood for $10,000 for the remainder of the 2009 season, despite his first-crop success. His 2010 stud fee was posted as $30,000 but by 2017 it had fallen to $5,000. Birdstone has sired 30 black-type runners, 19 stakes winners, 8 graded stakes winners, and has amassed progeny earnings over $21 million. Birdstone's most notable progeny includes: * Summer Bird: Won Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup, 2009 Eclipse Champion 3 Year Old Colt. * Mine That Bird: Won Kentucky Derby, Grey Stakes, 2008 Canadian Champion Juvenile Male. * Noble Bird: Won Stephen Foster Handicap, Pimlico Special, Fayette Stakes. * Birdrun: Won Brooklyn Handicap. * Blue Tone: Won San Gabriel Stakes. * Thank You Marylou: Won Dogwood Stakes, multiple graded stakes placed.

Cape Blanco extends further west than any point of land in the contiguous United States (lower 48 states) except portions of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, including Cape Alava, the true westernmost point. The cape is part of Cape Blanco State Park and is the location of the Cape Blanco Light, first lit in 1870. The cape may have been named by explorer Mart√≠n de Aguilar in 1603 for its appearance, as blanco means \\"white\\" in Spanish. In 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra named the point Cabo Diligensias. It was later renamed Cape Orford by Captain George Vancouver in 1792, but this name fell into disuse and Cape Blanco became the common usage. Geology The cape, a relatively level landform with cliffs facing the sea, is about higher than the ocean. It consists of layers of uplifted marine sediments, ranging in age from 80 million years at the bottom to less than 500,000 years at the top. The uplift is continuing; Cape Blanco is rising by several millimeters each year. Generally, landforms on the north and south end of the Oregon Coast are rising as the ocean floor slides under the continent, while the central part of the coast \\"seems to be folding down.\\" Landforms near the cape include beaches, bluffs, and reefs. Visible to the south are Needle Rock, Blanco Reef, and Humbug Mountain. To the north are Gull Rock, Castle Rock, and Blacklock Point. Blanco Reef is a group of irregular rocks and ledges that are from offshore and are up to high. Geography Cape Blanco is in northern Curry County, about north of Port Orford, along a mountainous and isolated stretch of the coast bounded to the east by the Coast Range. It lies about west of U.S. Route 101. The Sixes River empties into the Pacific Ocean along the north side of the cape. A walk along the Oregon Coast Trail leads south from the park to the mouth of the Elk River. Climate Cape Blanco has very mild temperatures year round, with an all-time record high of only . Annual precipitation is high, but there is a distinct drying trend in summer, which gives Cape Blanco a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification system. During winter storms, wind speeds can reach at the cape. Extreme winds at the cape and over the Blanco Reef make this part of the coast especially dangerous for ships. Recreation Activities at the park include hiking, horseback riding, fishing, camping, picnicking, and beachcombing, among others, and visiting the lighthouse, a pioneer cemetery, or the Hughes House, on the National Register of Historic Places. The property belonged originally to Patrick Hughes, who came to the cape in 1860 in search of gold and who eventually established a dairy ranch along the lower Sixes River. Restored by the Friends of Cape Blanco, the two-story, eleven-room ranch house was completed in 1898. Literature In Jules Verne's early science fiction book The Begum's Millions, a Utopian community named Ville-France is established in 1872 on the South Oregon beach. Verne gives the location of this fictitious community as \\"eighty kilometres north of Cape Blanco\\". Cape Blanco is also noted on a map of Brobdingnag in Gulliver's Travels. It is also mentioned in Chapter 3 of Moby-Dick: \\"And that harpoon-so like a corkscrew now-was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.\\" Gallery File:Cape Blanco State Park.jpgNorth side of the Cape File:Cape Blanco and Lighthouse.JPGCape Blanco and lighthouse File:Cape Blanco looking north.JPGCape Blanco looking north towards Gulf Rock, Castle Rock and Floras Lake State Park See also *Cape Blanco (disambiguation) *Cape Blanco State Airport *Cape Mendocino *Extreme points of U.S. states *List of Oregon state parks References External links Cape Blanco Heritage Society Blanco State parks of Oregon Oregon Coast Landforms of Curry County, Oregon Parks in Curry County, Oregon ","title":"Cape Blanco (Oregon)"},{"id":"708358","text":"The Coos River flows for about into Coos Bay along the Pacific coast of southwest Oregon in the United States. Formed by the confluence of its major tributaries, the South Fork Coos River and the Millicoma River, it drains an important timber-producing region of the Southern Oregon Coast Range. The course of the main stem and the major tributaries is generally westward from the coastal forests to the eastern end of Coos Bay near the city of Coos Bay. The river is the largest tributary of Coos Bay, which at about is the largest estuary that lies entirely within Oregon.

About 30 other tributaries also enter the bay directly. Most of the Coos River watershed of is in Coos County, but are in eastern Douglas County. Commercial forests cover about 85 percent of the basin. The river supports populations of chinook and coho salmon, shad, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Since public river-bank access is limited, fishing is often done by boat.Sheehan, pp. 66-67 Course Flowing west from the confluence of the South Fork Coos River and the Millicoma River, the Coos River is bordered by Oregon Route 241 (Coos River Highway) on the right and Coos River Road on the left. Downstream from its source, the river receives Noah Creek from the right from the river mouth. Curving south, the river receives Vogel Creek and then Lillian Creek, both from the left, before passing under Chandler Bridge, which carries Route 241 from the right bank to the left bank about from the mouth. The river then turns west and north as it enters the bay and splits into two distributaries separated by a marsh. The Cooston Channel, which is on the right, continues north around the west side of the marsh for about to the mouth. The left-hand channel almost immediately merges with Catching Slough, which enters from the left and continues around the east side of the marsh to meet the Marshfield Channel of the bay. Discharge Estimates of the average discharge of the Coos River varies from in late summer to in February. Estimated extremes vary from a low of to a high of .

Shellfishing in Coos Bay  Some of Oregon's most productive shellfishing is in Coos Bay. Coos Bay is Oregon's largest bay, and the lower part of the bay offers many shellfishing opportunities such as crabbing and clamming. The lower bay is the area that extends from the airport to the ocean entrance, and is marine dominated (meaning there is little freshwater influence). Some popular, easily accessible clamming spots are along Cape Arago highway, where recreational clammers can dig for gaper and butter clams, in the extensive mud flats during low tide.

It drains an area of the Central Oregon Coast Range west of the Willamette Valley near Newport. It rises in the mountains west of Corvallis along the county line between Benton and Lincoln counties. It flows south, then generally west, in a highly serpentine course, past Eddyville, Chitwood, Toledo, and Elk City, and enters the Pacific in Yaquina Bay, a broad estuary at Newport. U.S. Route 20, the Corvallis‚ÄìNewport highway, follows the river from Eddyville, at the confluence of the river with Little Elk Creek, to slightly downstream of Chitwood. Near the mouth of Yaquina Bay, the river passes under Yaquina Bay Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 101. Other bridges over the river include the Chitwood Covered Bridge at Chitwood. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Center and the Hatfield Marine Science Center are both along Yaquina Bay. Adjacent to the Hatfield Center is the Oregon Coast Aquarium. The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, contained within the Yaquina Bay State Recreation Site, is on the coast near the mouth of the river. Fishing A large charter fishing fleet operates out of Newport in search of halibut, salmon, and other fish found in the nearby ocean. Species within the bay include cabezon, striped perch, rockfish, greenling, salmon, sturgeon, herring, and crabs. The river upstream of the bay supports populations of salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout. The river and bay are also fished from the banks in places and from small boats. Boat- launching ramps are available along the lower river and the bay. Tributaries Named tributaries of the Yaquina River from source to mouth begin with Bailey Creek and the Little Yaquina River followed by Splide, Humphrey, Young, Felton, Davis, Randall, Stony, Bryant, and Buttermilk creeks.

Formed by the confluence of its north and south forks near Valsetz in Polk County, it winds through the Central Oregon Coast Range. The river, draining a watershed of , empties into Siletz Bay, south of Lincoln City in Lincoln County. Although the river travels in river miles, its winding course begins only about east of the ocean, and its mouth and source latitudes are almost identical. Course The river begins slightly east of the Polk-Lincoln county border in the Siuslaw National Forest of the Central Oregon Coast Range. Flowing west, it crosses into Lincoln County, returns to Polk County, then re-enters Lincoln County for the last time about from the mouth. Blind Creek enters from the left about further on. Flowing generally southwest, the river receives Elk and then Holman creeks from the right, Sunshine Creek from the left, Buck Creek from the right, followed by Wolfer Creek from the left at about river mile (RM) 57 or river kilometer (RK) 92\\\\. About later, the river turns west and soon receives Wildcat Creek from the right. For parts of its course along its upper reaches, the river flows near non-contiguous parcels of land belonging to the Siletz Reservation. Turning southwest and then south, the Siletz receives Palmer Creek from the right, flows by Moonshine County Park, then receives Baker Creek and Mill Creek from the left before reaching Logsden, about from the mouth. Passing under Rock Creek Road and receiving Rock Creek from the left, the river turns west again and soon receives Scott Creek from the right, Sam Creek from the left, and Bentilla and Baker creeks, both from the right. Continuing south and then west parallel to Upper Siletz Road, the river passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge and reaches Siletz at about RM 41 (RK 66). At Siletz, the river receives Mill and Dewey creeks from the left. Following a series of meanders that carry it under Oregon Route 229 twice and almost completely around the city of Siletz, the river heads north, roughly parallel to Route 229, which runs near it all the way to Siletz Bay. In the next stretch, the river receives Tangerman, Spencer. and Thompson creeks, all from the right. Turning west about from the mouth, the river flows under Route 229 at Ojalla Bridge and then receives Ojalla Creek from the left at RM 30 (RK 48). Meandering north, then east, then north again, the Siletz receives Euchre Creek and Reed creeks from the right. After another sharp turn to the west from the mouth, the river flows by Jack Morgan County Park and receives Chitwood, Hough, and Wade creeks, all from the right. Cedar and Misac creeks then enter from the right, Jaybird Creek from the left, and, from the mouth, Roy Creek from the left. Over the next , the river again doubles back on itself, flowing west, then north, then east until it is near Roy Creek again, then turns north. It receives Roots, Skalada, Townsend, and Stemple creeks in quick succession, all from the right, near RM 15 (RK 24). Shortly thereafter, Scare Creek enters from the left. Butterfield Creek enters from the left just before the river makes another sharp turn to the east, receiving Foster Creek from the left and Reed Creek from the right about from the mouth. Turning north and then west again, the river over the next receives Bear, Skunk, Barhaven, and Anderson creeks, all from the right. A distributary, Millport Slough, branches to the left from the main stem as the river nears Siletz Bay and the Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The river reaches Kernville, passes under U.S. Route 101 and enters the bay. Discharge The USGS monitors the flow of the Siletz River at a station east of Siletz and from the mouth. The average flow of the river at this station is . This is from a drainage area of , or about 54 percent of the total Siletz River watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on November 28, 1999, and the minimum flow was on September 5-6, 2003. Tides affect the flow along the last of the river. Fishing The river has been described as \\"a fine all-around stream\\" with good accessibility. Sport fish include fall chinook salmon, summer and winter steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Fishing by boat is most common between Moonshine Park and Jack Morgan Park. The city of Siletz has a boat ramp, parking, and a picnic area along the river, and the lower river and bay have many moorages offering boats and fishing equipment.

The head of tide is upstream. It is part of the homeland of the Siuslaw people, after whom it is named. Citizens of the Siuslaw nation lived in villages along the river until 1860 when they were forcibly removed to an Indian reservation in Yachats whereupon their homes, farms, gardens and villages were destroyed and occupied by U.S. settler-colonists. The valley of the river has been one of the productive timber regions in Oregon. The lower course of the river passes through Siuslaw National Forest. The Coos Bay branch of the Coos Bay Rail Link crosses many bridges as it follows the narrow, winding valley of the Siuslaw River to the swing bridge at Cushman. The river has historically been a spawning ground for Chinook and coho salmon. Although the Chinook population is substantial, coho numbers have declined from an annual average of 209,000 fish between 1889 and 1896 to just over 3,000 fish between 1990 and 1995.

The episode of her violation by Shechem, son of a Canaanite or Hivite prince, and the subsequent vengeance of her brothers Simeon and Levi, commonly referred to as the rape of Dinah, is told in Genesis 34. In Genesis Dinah is first mentioned in Genesis 30:21 as the daughter of Leah and Jacob, born to Leah after she bore six sons to Jacob. In Genesis 34, Dinah went out to visit the women of Shechem, where her people had made camp and where her father Jacob had purchased the land where he had pitched his tent. Shechem (the son of Hamor, the prince of the land) \\"took her and lay with her and humbled her. And his soul was drawn to Dinah ... he loved the maiden and spoke tenderly to her\\", and Shechem asked his father to obtain Dinah for him, to be his wife. Hamor came to Jacob and asked for Dinah for his son: \\"Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. You shall dwell with us; and the land shall be open to you.\\" Shechem offered Jacob and his sons any bride-price they named. But \\"the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah\\"; they said they would accept the offer if the men of the city agreed to be circumcised. So the men of Shechem were deceived, and were circumcised; and \\"on the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob and Leah, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males. They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.\\" And the sons of Jacob plundered whatever was in the city and in the field, \\"all their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses.\\" \\"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.' But they said, 'Should he treat our sister as a harlot? (Genesis 34:31). Origin of Genesis 34 17th century depiction of the rape of Dinah. This portion of the Book of Genesis deals primarily with the family of Abraham and his descendants, including Dinah, her father Jacob, and her brothers. The traditional view is that Moses wrote Genesis as well as almost all the rest of the Torah, doubtlessly using varied sources but synthesizing all of them together to give the Hebrews a written history of their ancestors. This view‚Äîwhich has been held for the past several thousand years, although it is not explicitly mentioned in either the Hebrew or the Christian Bible‚Äîholds that Moses included this story primarily because it happened and he viewed it as significant. It foreshadows later happenings and prophecies further along in Genesis and the Torah dealing with the two violent brothers. Source-critical scholars speculate that Genesis combines separate literary strands, with different values and concerns, and does not pre-date the 1st millennium BC as a unified account. Within Genesis 34 itself, they suggest two layers of narrative: an older account ascribing the killing of Shechem to Simeon and Levi alone, and a later addition (verses 27 to 29) involving all the sons of Jacob. Kirsch argues that the narrative combines a Yahwist narrator describing a rape, and an Elohist speaker describing a seduction.Kirsch, Jonathan. Harlot by the Side of the Road, Random House, 2009. On the other hand, another critical scholar, Alexander Rof√©, assumes that the earlier authors would not have considered rape to be defilement in and of itself, and posits that the verb describing Dinah as \\"defiled\\" was added later (elsewhere in the Bible, only married or betrothed women are \\"defiled\\" by rape). He instead says that such a description reflected a \\"late, post-exilic notion that the idolatrous gentiles are impure [and supports] the prohibition of intermarriage and intercourse with them.\\" Such a supposed preoccupation with ethnic purity must therefore indicate a late date for Genesis in the 5th or 4th centuries BC, when the restored Jewish community in Jerusalem was similarly preoccupied with anti-Samaritan polemics. In Rof√©'s analysis, the \\"defilement\\" refers to interracial sex rather than rape. In rabbinic literature Midrashic literature contains a series of proposed explanations of the Bible by rabbis. It provides further hypotheses of the story of Dinah, suggesting answers to questions such as her offspring: Osnat a daughter from Shechem, and links to later incidents and characters. One midrash states that Dinah was conceived as a male in Leah's womb but miraculously changed to a female, lest the maid-servants (Bilhah and Zilpah) be associated with more of the Israelite tribes than Rachel. (Berakhot 60a) Another midrash implicates Jacob in Dinah's misfortune: when he went to meet Esau, he locked Dinah in a box, for fear that Esau would wish to marry her,\\"Dinah\\", JewishEncyclopedia.com but God rebuked him in these words: \\"If thou hadst married off thy daughter in time she would not have been tempted to sin, and might, moreover, have exerted a beneficial influence upon her husband\\" (Gen. R. lxxx.). Her brother Simeon promised to find a husband for her, but she did not wish to leave Shechem, fearing that, after her disgrace, no one would take her to wife (Gen. R. l.c.). However, she was later married to Job (Bava Batra 15b; Gen. R. l.c.). When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. She is therefore referred to as \\"the Canaanitish woman\\" (Gen. 46:10). Asenath (ib.) was her daughter by Shechem (Gen. R. l.c.).\\"Asenath\\", JewishEncyclopedia.com Early Christian commentators such as Jerome likewise assign some of the responsibility to Dinah, in venturing out to visit the women of Shechem. This story was used to demonstrate the danger to women in the public sphere as contrasted with the relative security of remaining in private.Shemesh, Yael. \\"Review of Joy A. Schroeder's Dinah‚Äôs Lament: The Biblical Legacy of Sexual Violence in Christian Interpretation\\", Review of Biblical Literature, July 2008, Society of Biblical Literature. Simeon and Levi On his deathbed, their father Jacob curses Simeon and Levi's anger (Genesis 49). Their tribal portions in the land of Israel are dispersed so that they would not be able to regroup and fight arbitrarily. According to the Midrash, Simeon and Levi were only 14 and 13 years old, respectively, at the time of the rape of Dinah. They possessed great moral zealousness (later, in the episode of the Golden Calf, the Tribe of Levi would demonstrate their absolute commitment to Moses' leadership by killing all the people involved in idol worship), but their anger was misdirected here. Gerard Hoet: \\"Simeon and Levi slay the people of Shechem\\" One midrash told how Jacob later tried to restrain their hot tempers by dividing their portions in the land of Israel, and neither had lands of their own. Therefore, Dinah's son by Shechem was counted among Simeon's progeny and received a portion of land in Israel, Dinah herself being \\"the Canaanite woman\\" mentioned among those who went down into Egypt with Jacob and his sons (Gen. 46:10). When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. (According to another tradition, her child from her rape by Shechem was Asenath, the wife of Joseph, and she herself later married the prophet Job (Bava Batra 15b; Gen. R. l.c.).) The Tribe of Simeon received land within the territory of Judah and served as itinerant teachers in Israel, traveling from place to place to earn a living. In the Hebrew Bible, the tribe of Levi received a few Cities of Refuge spread out over Israel, and relied for their sustenance on the priestly gifts that the Children of Israel gave them. In medieval rabbinic literature, there were efforts to justify the killing, not merely of Shechem and Hamor, but of all the townsmen. Maimonides argued that the killing was understandable because the townsmen had failed to uphold the seventh Noachide law (denim) to establish a criminal justice system. However, Nachmanides disagreed, partly because he viewed the seventh law as a positive commandment that was not punishable by death. Instead, Nachmanides said that the townsmen presumably violated other Noachide laws, such as idolatry or sexual immorality. Later, the Maharal reframed the issue‚Äînot as sin, but rather as a war. That is, he argued that Simeon and Levi acted lawfully insofar as they carried out a military operation as an act of vengeance or retribution for the rape of Dinah. Travel to Egypt When Jacob's family prepares to descend to Egypt , the Torah lists the 70 family members who went down together. Simeon's children include \\"Saul, the son of the Canaanite woman.\\"Bereishit - Chapter 46 - Genesis at chabad.org The medieval French rabbi Rashi hypothesized that this Saul was Dinah's son by Shechem. He suggests that after the brothers killed all the men in the city, including Shechem and his father, Dinah refused to leave the palace unless Simeon agreed to marry her and remove her shame (according to Nachmanides, she only lived in his house and did not have sex with him). Therefore, Dinah's son is counted among Simeon's progeny, and he received a portion of land in Israel in the time of Joshua. The list of the names of the families of Israel in Egypt is repeated in . In culture Symbol of black womanhood Dinah, Portrait of a Negress by Eastman Johnson In 19th-century America, \\"Dinah\\" became a generic name for an enslaved African woman.Footnote 3 to \\"Women's Rights Convention\\", New York Herald, 26 October 1850; U.S. Women's History Workshop. At the 1850 Woman's Rights Convention in New York, a speech by Sojourner Truth was reported on in the New York Herald, which used the name \\"Dinah\\" to symbolize black womanhood as represented by Truth: Lizzie McCloud, a slave on a Tennessee plantation during the American Civil War, recalled that Union soldiers called all enslaved women \\"Dinah\\". Describing her fear when the Union army arrived, she said: \\"We was so scared we run under the house and the Yankees called 'Come out Dinah' (didn't call none of us anything but Dinah). They said 'Dinah, we're fightin' to free you and get you out from under bondage'.\\"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States From Interviews with Former Slaves, The Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1938. Library of Congress, 1941. After the end of the war in 1865 The New York Times exhorted the newly liberated slaves to demonstrate that they had the moral values to use their freedom effectively, using the names \\"Sambo\\" and \\"Dinah\\" to represent male and female former slaves: \\"You are free Sambo, but you must work. Be virtuous too, oh Dinah!\\"Gutmann, Herbert. \\"Persistent Myths about the Afro-American Family\\" in The Slavery Reader, Psychology Press, 2003, p.263. The name Dinah was subsequently used for dolls and other images of black women.Husfloen, Kyle. Black Americana, Krause Publications, 2005, p.64. In literature The novel The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is a fictional autobiography of the biblical Dinah. In Diamant's version, Dinah falls in love with Shalem, the Canaanite prince, and goes to bed with him in preparation for marriage. Simon and Levi, Jacob's sons, instigate the discord between Jacob and the men of the King of Shechem out of fear for their own prosperity, even though Dinah tells them the truth.

About long, the river drains a remote area of the Coast Range into the Pacific Ocean. Rising in the mountains in northern Curry County, in the Siskiyou National Forest at confluence of its north and south forks, the river initially flows generally west along the south edge of the Grassy Knob Wilderness. It then flows northwest, approaching the coast north of Port Orford and entering the Pacific between Cape Blanco to the north and The Heads to the south. Course From the confluence of its two forks, Elk River flows generally west and northwest for about . All but the lowermost of it are in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. Forest Road 5325 follows the river along its left bank, becoming County Road 208 (Elk Creek Road) after leaving the national forest. County Road 208 ends when it reaches U.S. Route 101 about by water from the mouth of the river. In its first stretch, Elk River receives McCurdy and Blackberry creeks from the left, then Bungalow Creek from the right before Milbury Creek enters from the left at river mile (RM) 26 or river kilometer (RK) 42\\\\. About further downstream, Butler Creek enters from the right at Butler Bar Campground, and the river becomes the southern border of Grassy Knob Wilderness. Over the next few miles, Lost and Panther creeks enter from the left, then Sunshine Creek from the right near Sunshine Bar Campground, from the river mouth. Below this, Red Cedar and Slate creeks enter from the right and Platinum Creek from the left. After turning more sharply northwest, the river receives Bald Mountain Creek from the left, leaves the wilderness, and reaches the Elk River State Fish Hatchery. At this point, Anvil Creek enters from the right. Below the hatchery, Chapman Creek enters from the left, the river turns sharply north and meanders along the national forest border, crossing it a total of five times and leaving it on the final crossing. At this point, Rock Creek enters from the right from the mouth. About further downstream, Bagley Creek enters from the left, and below that Indian Creek enters from the right. After Elk River flows under Route 101, it meanders across the coastal flatland and turns north behind sand dunes. It enters the Pacific Ocean between Cape Blanco on the north and Port Orford on the south. In the ocean opposite the mouth are Orford Reef and a portion of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. Recreation The Elk River at a high water level in 1999 Fishing, camping, hiking, swimming, and wildlife viewing are among the forms of recreation pursued in the Elk River watershed. The river and its tributaries support native chinook salmon, coastal cutthroat trout, winter steelhead, and coho salmon. Fishing is permitted within the national forest boundaries only on the of the river below the confluence with Bald Mountain Creek. Downstream of the Elk River Hatchery, about of the river that flows by private land is open for fishing from drift boats. In 1988, parts of the Elk River and its north fork were designated Wild and Scenic. The lower of the river's north fork are classified \\"wild.\\" The segment of the main stem from the confluence of the river's north and south forks to Anvil Creek is classified \\"recreational.\\" Three national forest campgrounds‚ÄîSunshine Bar and Butler Bar near the main stem and Laird Lake near the south fork‚Äî are along Forest Road 5325. The river has many pools that are big enough for swimming. Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run all or part of a stretch of the river between Butler Creek and the Elk River Hatchery. Rapids vary from class 3 to 4 on the International Scale of River Difficulty. In 2009, along the north and south forks of Elk River and the upper middle fork of Sixes River were designated as the Copper Salmon Wilderness.

It drains of the Central Oregon Coast Range between the watershed of the Umpqua to the south and the Siuslaw River to the north. Rising in northern Douglas County about north of Drain, the river flows generally west in a winding course through the mountains, passing through the Siuslaw National Forest for about in its lower course. It joins the Umpqua from the north across from Reedsport, about from the mouth of the Umpqua on the Pacific Ocean. The river is named for Jedediah Smith, who in 1828 led a party of explorers from Utah overland to northern California and southern Oregon. From California, they traveled north to the Umpqua River, camping along its banks near the mouth of the Smith River on July 13. An attack by Native Americans on July 14 killed 15 of Smith's party. One man escaped by heading north to Tillamook and then Fort Vancouver. Smith and two others who were not in camp at the time of the attack fled east toward the Willamette Valley and survived. The Smith River in California is also named for Smith. Tributaries Smith River north of Reedsport Named tributaries of the Smith River from source to mouth are Spring, Whiskey, Alder, Watering Trough, Sleezer, Tip Davis, Peterson, Redford, and Hall creeks. Then Summit, Hefty, Plank, Clevenger, Beaver, Elk, and Arthur Jones creeks. Next is the South Fork Smith River followed by Salmonberry, Amberson, Panther, Haney, Huckleberry, Deer, Yellow, and Hardenbrook creeks. Next, continuing downstream, are Cleghorn, Johnson, Slideout, Clabber, Halfway, Mosetown, Blind, Rock, Marsh, Devils Club, South Sister and North Sister creeks. Then Beaver, Carpenter, Coldwater, Clearwater, Blackwell, and Scare creeks. Next is the West Fork Smith River followed by Vincent, Rachel, Johnson, Bear, Little Buck, and Buck creeks.

David. \\"Caravans, Kenites, and Casus Belli: Enmity and Alliance in the Song of Deborah.\\" The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, vol. 55, no. 1, 1993, pp. 18‚Äì38. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43721140.) was a concubine (1917 Jewish Publication Society of America translation). \\"And the sons of Keturah, Abraham‚Äôs concubine....\\" and wife (1917 Jewish Publication Society of America translation). \\"And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah....\\" of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. According to the Book of Genesis, Abraham married Keturah after the death of his first wife, Sarah. Abraham and Keturah had six sons. One modern commentator on the Hebrew Bible has called Keturah \\"the most ignored significant person in the Torah\\". The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi, and some previous rabbinical commentators, related a traditional belief that Keturah was the same person as Hagar, although this idea cannot be found in the biblical text. The biblical traditions concerning Abraham and related characters are generally regarded as non-historical by scholars. Sources for Keturah Keturah is mentioned in two passages of the Hebrew Bible: in the Book of Genesis, and also in the First Book of Chronicles. Additionally, she is mentioned in Antiquities of the Jews by the 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus, in the Talmud, the Midrash, the Targum on the Torah, the Genesis Rabbah, and various other writings of Jewish theologians and philosophers. Louis Feldman has said \\"Josephus records evidence of the prolific non-Jewish polymath Alexander Polyhistor, who, in turn, cites the historian Cleodemus Malchus, who states that two of the sons of Abraham by Keturah joined Heracles' campaign in Africa, and that Heracles, without doubt the greatest Greek hero of them all, married the daughter of one of them.\\" Relationship of Keturah to Abraham Keturah is referred to in Genesis as \\"another wife\\" of Abraham (Strong's Concordance, Hebrew word #376.). In First Chronicles, she is called Abraham's \\"concubine\\" (Strong's Concordance, Hebrew word #6370.). Keturah and Hagar There is disagreement amongst Jewish scholars as to whether Keturah was, or was not, the same person as Hagar (known in Islam as HƒÅjar)‚Äîa handmaid of Abraham's wife Sarah, and Abraham's concubine (or, in Islamic tradition, his second wife)‚Äîwho, together with her son Ishmael, was sent away by Abraham at the insistence of Sarah.. The discussion of in the Genesis Rabbah includes statements by Rabbi Judah the Prince arguing that Hagar returned to Abraham and was renamed Keturah. Her new name (Keturah means incense in Hebrew) is said to refer to the pleasant aroma of incense‚Äîsymbolic of her having turned from misdeeds committed during her time away from Abraham. Since Keturah is referred to in First Chronicles as Abraham's concubine (in the singular), some scholars concluded that this was why Keturah was identified with Hagar in the Midrash and the Palestinian Targumim. An alternative interpretation of the name Keturah (based on an Aramaic root meaning \\"to tie\\" or \\"to adorn\\") is also cited in the Genesis Rabbah to suggest that Hagar did not have sexual relations with anyone else from the time she left Abraham until her return. The theory that Keturah was Hagar was also supported by the 11th-century scholar Rashi.Rashi on Genesis 25:1 cites Genesis Rabbah 61:5 in his commentary: \\"Keturah: This is Hagar. She was called Keturah because her deeds were as pleasant as keturah (incense), and because she remained chaste (katrah, from the Aramaic for \\"restrained\\") and did not consort with another man from the day she separated from Abraham\\". Biblical scholar Richard Elliott Friedman dismisses the identification of Keturah with Hagar as \\"an old rabbinic idea\\" for which \\"there is no basis ... in the text\\", and also notes that the idea was rejected by traditional commentators such as Ibn Ezra, Nahmanides, and Rashbam. The Book of Jubilees also supports the conclusion that Keturah and Hagar were two different people, by stating that Abraham waited until after Hagar's death before marrying Keturah.Jubilees 19:11. Descendants Keturah bore Abraham six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. Genesis and First Chronicles also list seven of her grandsons (Sheba, Dedan, Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah). Keturah's sons were said to have represented the Arab tribes who lived south and east of Israel (). According to the African writer Olaudah Equiano, the 18th-century English theologian John Gill believed the African people were descended from Abraham and Keturah. According to the Bah√° º√≠ author John Able, Bah√° º√≠s consider their founder, Bah√°'u'll√°h, to have been \\"descended doubly, from both Abraham and Sarah, and separately from Abraham and Keturah.\\" References Midian Abraham Book of Genesis people Jewish concubines Women in the Hebrew Bible Concubines ","title":"Keturah"},{"id":"708399","text":"Euclid's Elements, found at Oxyrhynchus and dated to circa AD 100.

Among published compilations of important publications in mathematics are Landmark writings in Western mathematics 1640‚Äì1940 by Ivor Grattan-Guinness and A Source Book in Mathematics by David Eugene Smith. Algebra Theory of equations =Baudhayana Sulba Sutra= * Baudhayana (8th century BCE) Believed to have been written around the 8th century BCE, this is one of the oldest mathematical texts. It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia and its surrounding regions, and perhaps even Greece. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, geometric solutions of linear equations, the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax2 = c and ax2 \\\\+ bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous Diophantine equations with up to four unknowns. =The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art= * The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art from the 10th‚Äì2nd century BCE.

This algebra came along with the Hindu Number system to Arabia and then migrated to Europe. The text contains 33 verses covering mensuration (k·π£etra vyƒÅvahƒÅra), arithmetic and geometric progressions, gnomon / shadows (shanku-chhAyA), simple, quadratic, simultaneous, and indeterminate equations. It also gave the modern standard algorithm for solving first-order diophantine equations. =Jigu Suanjing= Jigu Suanjing (626 CE) This book by Tang dynasty mathematician Wang Xiaotong Contains the world's earliest third order equation. =BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta= *Brahmagupta (628 CE) Contained rules for manipulating both negative and positive numbers, rules for dealing the number zero, a method for computing square roots, and general methods of solving linear and some quadratic equations, solution to Pell's equation. =Al- KitƒÅb al-mukhta·π£ar fƒ´ hƒ´sƒÅb al-ƒüabr wa'l-muqƒÅbala= * Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al- KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ (820 CE) The first book on the systematic algebraic solutions of linear and quadratic equations by the Persian scholar Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al- KhwƒÅrizmƒ´. The book is considered to be the foundation of modern algebra and Islamic mathematics. The word \\"algebra\\" itself is derived from the al-Jabr in the title of the book.

The first volume deals with determinate equations, while the second part deals with Diophantine equations. The last section contains a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 3, making some valid assumptions regarding Q() that Euler did not prove. =Demonstratio nova theorematis omnem functionem algebraicam rationalem integram unius variabilis in factores reales primi vel secundi gradus resolvi posse= * Carl Friedrich Gauss (1799) Gauss' doctoral dissertation, which contained a widely accepted (at the time) but incomplete proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Abstract algebra =Group theory= R√©flexions sur la r√©solution alg√©brique des √©quations *Joseph Louis Lagrange (1770) The title means \\"Reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations\\". Made the prescient observation that the roots of the Lagrange resolvent of a polynomial equation are tied to permutations of the roots of the original equation, laying a more general foundation for what had previously been an ad hoc analysis and helping motivate the later development of the theory of permutation groups, group theory, and Galois theory. The Lagrange resolvent also introduced the discrete Fourier transform of order 3. =Articles Publi√©s par Galois dans les Annales de Math√©matiques= * Journal de Mathematiques pures et Appliqu√©es, II (1846) Posthumous publication of the mathematical manuscripts of √âvariste Galois by Joseph Liouville. Included are Galois' papers M√©moire sur les conditions de r√©solubilit√© des √©quations par radicaux and Des √©quations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux. =Trait√© des substitutions et des √©quations alg√©briques= *Camille Jordan (1870) Online version: Online version Trait√© des substitutions et des √©quations alg√©briques (Treatise on Substitutions and Algebraic Equations). The first book on group theory, giving a then-comprehensive study of permutation groups and Galois theory. In this book, Jordan introduced the notion of a simple group and epimorphism (which he called l'isomorphisme m√©ri√©drique), proved part of the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem, and discussed matrix groups over finite fields as well as the Jordan normal form. =Theorie der Transformationsgruppen= *Sophus Lie, Friedrich Engel (1888‚Äì1893). Publication data: 3 volumes, B.G. Teubner, Verlagsgesellschaft, mbH, Leipzig, 1888‚Äì1893. Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3. The first comprehensive work on transformation groups, serving as the foundation for the modern theory of Lie groups. =Solvability of groups of odd order= *Walter Feit and John Thompson (1960) Description: Gave a complete proof of the solvability of finite groups of odd order, establishing the long-standing Burnside conjecture that all finite non-abelian simple groups are of even order. Many of the original techniques used in this paper were used in the eventual classification of finite simple groups. =Homological algebra= =Homological Algebra= * Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg (1956) Provided the first fully worked out treatment of abstract homological algebra, unifying previously disparate presentations of homology and cohomology for associative algebras, Lie algebras, and groups into a single theory. =\\"Sur Quelques Points d'Alg√®bre Homologique\\"= * Alexander Grothendieck (1957) Often referred to as the \\"T√¥hoku paper\\", it revolutionized homological algebra by introducing abelian categories and providing a general framework for Cartan and Eilenberg's notion of derived functors. Algebraic geometry Theorie der Abelschen Functionen * Bernhard Riemann (1857) Publication data: Journal f√ºr die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik Developed the concept of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties beyond Riemann's 1851 thesis work, proved an index theorem for the genus (the original formulation of the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula), proved the Riemann inequality for the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles (the original formulation of the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem), discussed birational transformations of a given curve and the dimension of the corresponding moduli space of inequivalent curves of a given genus, and solved more general inversion problems than those investigated by Abel and Jacobi. Andr√© Weil once wrote that this paper \\"is one of the greatest pieces of mathematics that has ever been written; there is not a single word in it that is not of consequence.\\" Faisceaux Alg√©briques Coh√©rents * Jean-Pierre Serre Publication data: Annals of Mathematics, 1955 FAC, as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of sheaves in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of complex manifolds. Serre introduced ƒåech cohomology of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry. For example, the long exact sequence in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group. The dimension of a vector space of sections of a coherent sheaf is finite, in projective geometry, and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example Hodge numbers. While Grothendieck's derived functor cohomology has replaced ƒåech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by ƒåech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important. G√©om√©trie Alg√©brique et G√©om√©trie Analytique * Jean-Pierre Serre (1956) In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are closely related subjects, where analytic geometry is the theory of complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from Hodge theory. (NB While analytic geometry as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was G√©ometrie Alg√©brique et G√©om√©trie Analytique by Serre, now usually referred to as GAGA. A GAGA-style result would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings. Le th√©or√®me de Riemann‚ÄìRoch, d'apr√®s A. Grothendieck * Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre (1958) Borel and Serre's exposition of Grothendieck's version of the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result. Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that Hirzebruch proved in 1953 in the framework of morphisms between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization. In his proof, Grothendieck broke new ground with his concept of Grothendieck groups, which led to the development of K-theory. √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique * Alexander Grothendieck (1960‚Äì1967) Written with the assistance of Jean Dieudonn√©, this is Grothendieck's exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry. It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry. The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances. S√©minaire de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique * Alexander Grothendieck et al. These seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at IH√âS starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960‚Äì1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is Pierre Deligne's proof of the last of the open Weil conjectures in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include Michel Raynaud, Michael Artin, Jean-Pierre Serre, Jean-Louis Verdier, Pierre Deligne, and Nicholas Katz. Number theory BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta *Brahmagupta (628) Brahmagupta's BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers. De fractionibus continuis dissertatio *Leonhard Euler (1744) First presented in 1737, this paper provided the first then- comprehensive account of the properties of continued fractions. It also contains the first proof that the number e is irrational. Recherches d'Arithm√©tique *Joseph Louis Lagrange (1775) Developed a general theory of binary quadratic forms to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form ax^2 + by^2 + cxy. This included a reduction theory for binary quadratic forms, where he proved that every form is equivalent to a certain canonically chosen reduced form. Disquisitiones Arithmeticae *Carl Friedrich Gauss (1801) The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a profound and masterful book on number theory written by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre and adds many important new results of his own. Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the first two published proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, a deep investigation of binary quadratic forms going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithm√©tique, a first appearance of Gauss sums, cyclotomy, and the theory of constructible polygons with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular 17-gon. Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of class numbers of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had conjectured. In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the Hasse‚ÄìWeil theorem). \\"Beweis des Satzes, da√ü jede unbegrenzte arithmetische Progression, deren erstes Glied und Differenz ganze Zahlen ohne gemeinschaftlichen Factor sind, unendlich viele Primzahlen enth√§lt\\" *Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1837) Pioneering paper in analytic number theory, which introduced Dirichlet characters and their L-functions to establish Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. In subsequent publications, Dirichlet used these tools to determine, among other things, the class number for quadratic forms. \\"√úber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr√∂sse\\" *Bernhard Riemann (1859) \\"√úber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr√∂sse\\" (or \\"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\\") is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern analytic number theory. It also contains the famous Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in mathematics. Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie * Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory) is a textbook of number theory written by German mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863. The Vorlesungen can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of Fermat, Jacobi and Gauss, and the modern number theory of Dedekind, Riemann and Hilbert. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the group that is central to modern algebra, but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory Zahlbericht * David Hilbert (1897) Unified and made accessible many of the developments in algebraic number theory made during the nineteenth century. Although criticized by Andr√© Weil (who stated \\"more than half of his famous Zahlbericht is little more than an account of Kummer's number-theoretical work, with inessential improvements\\") and Emmy Noether, it was highly influential for many years following its publication. Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta-Functions * John Tate (1950) Generally referred to simply as Tate's Thesis, Tate's Princeton PhD thesis, under Emil Artin, is a reworking of Erich Hecke's theory of zeta- and L-functions in terms of Fourier analysis on the adeles. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke's results to more general L-functions such as those arising from automorphic forms. \\"Automorphic Forms on GL(2)\\" * Herv√© Jacquet and Robert Langlands (1970) This publication offers evidence towards Langlands' conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of modular forms and their L-functions through the introduction of representation theory. \\"La conjecture de Weil. I.\\" * Pierre Deligne (1974) Proved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open Weil conjectures. \\"Endlichkeitss√§tze f√ºr abelsche Variet√§ten √ºber Zahlk√∂rpern\\" * Gerd Faltings (1983) Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the Mordell conjecture (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the Tate conjecture (relating the homomorphisms between two abelian varieties over a number field to the homomorphisms between their Tate modules) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties. \\"Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last Theorem\\" * Andrew Wiles (1995) This article proceeds to prove a special case of the Shimura‚ÄìTaniyama conjecture through the study of the deformation theory of Galois representations. This in turn implies the famed Fermat's Last Theorem. The proof's method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an R=T theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory. The geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties * Michael Harris and Richard Taylor (2001) Harris and Taylor provide the first proof of the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n). As part of the proof, this monograph also makes an in depth study of the geometry and cohomology of certain Shimura varieties at primes of bad reduction. \\"Le lemme fondamental pour les alg√®bres de Lie\\" * Ng√¥ B·∫£o Ch√¢u Ng√¥ B·∫£o Ch√¢u proved a long-standing unsolved problem in the classical Langlands program, using methods from the Geometric Langlands program. Analysis Introductio in analysin infinitorum * Leonhard Euler (1748) The eminent historian of mathematics Carl Boyer once called Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum the greatest modern textbook in mathematics. Published in two volumes, this book more than any other work succeeded in establishing analysis as a major branch of mathematics, with a focus and approach distinct from that used in geometry and algebra. Notably, Euler identified functions rather than curves to be the central focus in his book. Logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, and transcendental functions were covered, as were expansions into partial fractions, evaluations of for a positive integer between 1 and 13, infinite series and infinite product formulas, continued fractions, and partitions of integers. In this work, Euler proved that every rational number can be written as a finite continued fraction, that the continued fraction of an irrational number is infinite, and derived continued fraction expansions for and \\\\textstyle\\\\sqrt{e}. This work also contains a statement of Euler's formula and a statement of the pentagonal number theorem, which he had discovered earlier and would publish a proof for in 1751. Calculus =YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ= *Jyeshtadeva (1501) Written in India in 1530, this was the world's first calculus text. \\"This work laid the foundation for a complete system of fluxions\\" and served as a summary of the Kerala School's achievements in calculus, trigonometry and mathematical analysis, most of which were earlier discovered by the 14th century mathematician Madhava. It is possible that this text influenced the later development of calculus in Europe. Some of its important developments in calculus include: the fundamental ideas of differentiation and integration, the derivative, differential equations, term by term integration, numerical integration by means of infinite series, the relationship between the area of a curve and its integral, and the mean value theorem. =Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quae nec fractas nec irrationales quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illi calculi genus= *Gottfried Leibniz (1684) Leibniz's first publication on differential calculus, containing the now familiar notation for differentials as well as rules for computing the derivatives of powers, products and quotients. =Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica= *Isaac Newton The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin: \\"mathematical principles of natural philosophy\\", often Principia or Principia Mathematica for short) is a three-volume work by Isaac Newton published on 5 July 1687. Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of Newton's laws of motion forming the foundation of classical mechanics as well as his law of universal gravitation, and derives Kepler's laws for the motion of the planets (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena. In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus. When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments. =Institutiones calculi differentialis cum eius usu in analysi finitorum ac doctrina serierum= Institutiones calculi differentialis *Leonhard Euler (1755) Published in two books, Euler's textbook on differential calculus presented the subject in terms of the function concept, which he had introduced in his 1748 Introductio in analysin infinitorum. This work opens with a study of the calculus of finite differences and makes a thorough investigation of how differentiation behaves under substitutions. Also included is a systematic study of Bernoulli polynomials and the Bernoulli numbers (naming them as such), a demonstration of how the Bernoulli numbers are related to the coefficients in the Euler‚ÄìMaclaurin formula and the values of Œ∂(2n), a further study of Euler's constant (including its connection to the gamma function), and an application of partial fractions to differentiation. =√úber die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe= *Bernhard Riemann (1867) Written in 1853, Riemann's work on trigonometric series was published posthumously. In it, he extended Cauchy's definition of the integral to that of the Riemann integral, allowing some functions with dense subsets of discontinuities on an interval to be integrated (which he demonstrated by an example). He also stated the Riemann series theorem, proved the Riemann‚ÄìLebesgue lemma for the case of bounded Riemann integrable functions, and developed the Riemann localization principle. =Int√©grale, longueur, aire= *Henri Lebesgue (1901) Lebesgue's doctoral dissertation, summarizing and extending his research to date regarding his development of measure theory and the Lebesgue integral. Complex analysis =Grundlagen f√ºr eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer ver√§nderlichen complexen Gr√∂sse= * Bernhard Riemann (1851) Riemann's doctoral dissertation introduced the notion of a Riemann surface, conformal mapping, simple connectivity, the Riemann sphere, the Laurent series expansion for functions having poles and branch points, and the Riemann mapping theorem. Functional analysis =Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires = * Stefan Banach (1932; originally published 1931 in Polish under the title Teorja operacyj.) * The first mathematical monograph on the subject of linear metric spaces, bringing the abstract study of functional analysis to the wider mathematical community. The book introduced the ideas of a normed space and the notion of a so-called B-space, a complete normed space. The B-spaces are now called Banach spaces and are one of the basic objects of study in all areas of modern mathematical analysis. Banach also gave proofs of versions of the open mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, and Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem. =Produits Tensoriels Topologiques et Espaces Nucl√©aires= * Grothendieck's thesis introduced the notion of a nuclear space, tensor products of locally convex topological vector spaces, and the start of Grothendieck's work on tensor products of Banach spaces. Alexander Grothendieck also wrote a textbook on topological vector spaces: * =Sur certains espaces vectoriels topologiques= * Fourier analysis =M√©moire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides= * Joseph Fourier (1807) Reprinted in Introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Key contribution was to not simply use trigonometric series, but to model all functions by trigonometric series: When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: ...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...] his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the Dirichlet integral and later the Lebesgue integral. =Sur la convergence des s√©ries trigonom√©triques qui servent √† repr√©senter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites donn√©es= * Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1829, expanded German edition in 1837) In his habilitation thesis on Fourier series, Riemann characterized this work of Dirichlet as \\"the first profound paper about the subject\\". This paper gave the first rigorous proof of the convergence of Fourier series under fairly general conditions (piecewise continuity and monotonicity) by considering partial sums, which Dirichlet transformed into a particular Dirichlet integral involving what is now called the Dirichlet kernel. This paper introduced the nowhere continuous Dirichlet function and an early version of the Riemann‚ÄìLebesgue lemma. =On convergence and growth of partial sums of Fourier series= * Lennart Carleson (1966) Settled Lusin's conjecture that the Fourier expansion of any L^2 function converges almost everywhere. Geometry Baudhayana Sulba Sutra * Baudhayana Written around the 8th century BC, this is one of the oldest geometrical texts. It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia and its surrounding regions, and perhaps even Greece. Among the important geometrical discoveries included in this text are: the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, the earliest statement of the Pythagorean theorem, geometric solutions of linear equations, several approximations of œÄ, the first use of irrational numbers, and an accurate computation of the square root of 2, correct to a remarkable five decimal places. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax2 = c and ax2 \\\\+ bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous Diophantine equations with up to four unknowns. Euclid's Elements * Euclid Publication data: c. 300 BC Online version: Interactive Java version This is often regarded as not only the most important work in geometry but one of the most important works in mathematics. It contains many important results in plane and solid geometry, algebra (books II and V), and number theory (book VII, VIII, and IX). More than any specific result in the publication, it seems that the major achievement of this publication is the promotion of an axiomatic approach as a means for proving results. Euclid's Elements has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art * Unknown author This was a Chinese mathematics book, mostly geometric, composed during the Han Dynasty, perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in China and East Asia for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid's Elements in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the rule of false position. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to Gaussian elimination. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the Pythagorean theorem. The earliest solution of a matrix using a method equivalent to the modern method. The Conics * Apollonius of Perga The Conics was written by Apollonius of Perga, a Greek mathematician. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemy, Francesco Maurolico, Isaac Newton, and Ren√© Descartes. It was Apollonius who gave the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola the names by which we know them. Surya Siddhanta * Unknown (400 CE) Contains the roots of modern trigonometry. It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or \\"perpendicular sine\\") and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time, and also contains the earliest use of the tangent and secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East. Aryabhatiya *Aryabhata (499 CE) This was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth's circumference. La G√©om√©trie * Ren√© Descartes La G√©om√©trie was published in 1637 and written by Ren√© Descartes. The book was influential in developing the Cartesian coordinate system and specifically discussed the representation of points of a plane, via real numbers; and the representation of curves, via equations. Grundlagen der Geometrie *David Hilbert Online version: English Publication data: Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry, whose primary influence was in its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions including the use of models to prove axiom independence and the importance of establishing the consistency and completeness of an axiomatic system. Regular Polytopes * H.S.M. Coxeter Regular Polytopes is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of regular polytopes, the generalisation of regular polygons and regular polyhedra to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled Dimensional Analogy written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973. Differential geometry =Recherches sur la courbure des surfaces= * Leonhard Euler (1760) Publication data: M√©moires de l'acad√©mie des sciences de Berlin 16 (1760) pp. 119‚Äì143; published 1767. (Full text and an English translation available from the Dartmouth Euler archive.) Established the theory of surfaces, and introduced the idea of principal curvatures, laying the foundation for subsequent developments in the differential geometry of surfaces. =Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas= * Carl Friedrich Gauss (1827) Publication data: \\"Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas\\", Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingesis Recentiores Vol. VI (1827), pp. 99‚Äì146; \\"General Investigations of Curved Surfaces\\" (published 1965) Raven Press, New York, translated by A.M.Hiltebeitel and J.C.Morehead. Groundbreaking work in differential geometry, introducing the notion of Gaussian curvature and Gauss' celebrated Theorema Egregium. =√úber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde Liegen= * Bernhard Riemann (1854) Publication data: \\"√úber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde Liegen\\", Abhandlungen der K√∂niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen, Vol. 13, 1867. English translation Riemann's famous Habiltationsvortrag, in which he introduced the notions of a manifold, Riemannian metric, and curvature tensor. =Le√ßons sur la th√©orie g√©nerale des surfaces et les applications g√©om√©triques du calcul infinit√©simal= *Gaston Darboux Publication data: Volume I, Volume II, Volume III, Volume IV Le√ßons sur la th√©orie g√©nerale des surfaces et les applications g√©om√©triques du calcul infinit√©simal (on the General Theory of Surfaces and the Geometric Applications of Infinitesimal Calculus). A treatise covering virtually every aspect of the 19th century differential geometry of surfaces. Topology Analysis situs * Henri Poincar√© (1895, 1899‚Äì1905) Description: Poincar√©'s Analysis Situs and his Compl√©ments √† l'Analysis Situs laid the general foundations for algebraic topology. In these papers, Poincar√© introduced the notions of homology and the fundamental group, provided an early formulation of Poincar√© duality, gave the Euler‚ÄìPoincar√© characteristic for chain complexes, and mentioned several important conjectures including the Poincar√© conjecture. L'anneau d'homologie d'une repr√©sentation, Structure de l'anneau d'homologie d'une repr√©sentation * Jean Leray (1946) These two Comptes Rendus notes of Leray from 1946 introduced the novel concepts of sheafs, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences, which he had developed during his years of captivity as a prisoner of war. Leray's announcements and applications (published in other Comptes Rendus notes from 1946) drew immediate attention from other mathematicians. Subsequent clarification, development, and generalization by Henri Cartan, Jean-Louis Koszul, Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Leray himself allowed these concepts to be understood and applied to many other areas of mathematics. Dieudonn√© would later write that these notions created by Leray \\"undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the methods invented by Poincar√© and Brouwer\\". Quelques propri√©t√©s globales des vari√©t√©s differentiables *Ren√© Thom (1954) In this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of oriented and unoriented cobordism, and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces. Thom completely characterized the unoriented cobordism ring and achieved strong results for several problems, including Steenrod's problem on the realization of cycles. Category theory \\"General Theory of Natural Equivalences\\" * Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane (1945) The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in Categories for the Working Mathematician that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, \\"natural\\" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, \\"natural\\" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences. Categories for the Working Mathematician * Saunders Mac Lane (1971, second edition 1998) Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses. Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as adjoint functors and universal properties. Higher Topos Theory * Jacob Lurie (2010) This purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of \\"quasicategories\\" or \\"weak Kan complexes\\"), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included. (see arXiv.) Set theory \\"√úber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen\\" * Georg Cantor (1874) Online version: Online version Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See Georg Cantor's first set theory article.) Grundz√ºge der Mengenlehre * Felix Hausdorff First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on measure theory and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas. \\"The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory\\" * Kurt G√∂del (1938) G√∂del proves the results of the title. Also, in the process, introduces the class L of constructible sets, a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory. \\"The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis\\" * Paul J. Cohen (1963, 1964) Cohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the continuum hypothesis and axiom of choice with respect to Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory. In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of forcing which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory. Logic The Laws of Thought * George Boole (1854) Published in 1854, The Laws of Thought was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re- expression and extension of Aristotle's logic in the language of mathematics. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for Claude Shannon in the development of digital logic. Begriffsschrift * Gottlob Frege (1879) Published in 1879, the title Begriffsschrift is usually translated as concept writing or concept notation; the full title of the book identifies it as \\"a formula language, modelled on that of arithmetic, of pure thought\\". Frege's motivation for developing his formal logical system was similar to Leibniz's desire for a calculus ratiocinator. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the foundations of mathematics. Begriffsschrift is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein. It was arguably the most significant publication in logic since Aristotle. Formulario mathematico * Giuseppe Peano (1895) First published in 1895, the Formulario mathematico was the first mathematical book written entirely in a formalized language. It contained a description of mathematical logic and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use. Principia Mathematica * Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead (1910‚Äì1913) The Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published in 1910‚Äì1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by G√∂del's incompleteness theorem in 1931. Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals * Alan Turing's PhD thesis \\"√úber formal unentscheidbare S√§tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I\\" (On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems) * Kurt G√∂del (1931) Online version: Online version In mathematical logic, G√∂del's incompleteness theorems are two celebrated theorems proved by Kurt G√∂del in 1931. The first incompleteness theorem states: > For any formal system such that (1) it is \\\\omega-consistent (omega- > consistent), (2) it has a recursively definable set of axioms and rules of > derivation, and (3) every recursive relation of natural numbers is definable > in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the > intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural > numbers and yet it is not a theorem of the system. Combinatorics \\"On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression\\" *Endre Szemer√©di (1975) Settled a conjecture of Paul Erd≈ës and P√°l Tur√°n (now known as Szemer√©di's theorem) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Szemer√©di's solution has been described as a \\"masterpiece of combinatorics\\" and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the Szemer√©di regularity lemma. Graph theory =Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis= * Leonhard Euler (1741) * Euler's original publication (in Latin) Euler's solution of the K√∂nigsberg bridge problem in Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. =\\"On the evolution of random graphs\\"= *Paul Erd≈ës and Alfr√©d R√©nyi (1960) Provides a detailed discussion of sparse random graphs, including distribution of components, occurrence of small subgraphs, and phase transitions. =\\"Network Flows and General Matchings\\"= * L. R. Ford, Jr. & D. R. Fulkerson * Flows in Networks. Prentice-Hall, 1962. Presents the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem, along with many ideas on flow-based models. Computational complexity theory See List of important publications in theoretical computer science. Probability theory and statistics See list of important publications in statistics. Game theory \\"Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele\\" * John von Neumann (1928) Went well beyond √âmile Borel's initial investigations into strategic two-person game theory by proving the minimax theorem for two-person, zero-sum games. Theory of Games and Economic Behavior * Oskar Morgenstern, John von Neumann (1944) This book led to the investigation of modern game theory as a prominent branch of mathematics. This work contained the method for finding optimal solutions for two-person zero-sum games. \\"Equilibrium Points in N-person Games\\" * Nash equilibrium On Numbers and Games *John Horton Conway The book is in two, {0,1}, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games ‚Äì both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as Nim, Hackenbush, Col and Snort amongst the many described. Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays *Elwyn Berlekamp, John Conway and Richard K. Guy A compendium of information on mathematical games. It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on Combinatorial game theory and surreal numbers, and the other concentrating on a number of specific games. Fractals How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension *Beno√Æt Mandelbrot A discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. Shows Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work. Numerical analysis Optimization =Method of Fluxions= * Isaac Newton Method of Fluxions was a book written by Isaac Newton. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736. Within this book, Newton describes a method (the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method) for finding the real zeroes of a function. =Essai d'une nouvelle m√©thode pour d√©terminer les maxima et les minima des formules int√©grales ind√©finies= * Joseph Louis Lagrange (1761) Major early work on the calculus of variations, building upon some of Lagrange's prior investigations as well as those of Euler. Contains investigations of minimal surface determination as well as the initial appearance of Lagrange multipliers. =\\"–ú–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥—ã –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞\\"= * Leonid Kantorovich (1939) \\"[The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization]\\" (in Russian). Kantorovich wrote the first paper on production planning, which used Linear Programs as the model. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 1975. =\\"Decomposition Principle for Linear Programs\\"= * George Dantzig and P. Wolfe * Operations Research 8:101‚Äì111, 1960. Dantzig's is considered the father of linear programming in the western world. He independently invented the simplex algorithm. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large- scale linear programs in factory and production planning. =\\"How Good is the Simplex Algorithm?\\"= * Victor Klee and George J. Minty * Klee and Minty gave an example showing that the simplex algorithm can take exponentially many steps to solve a linear program. =\\"–ü–æ–ª–∏–Ω–æ–º–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º –≤ –ª–∏–Ω–µ–π–Ω–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏\\"= * . Khachiyan's work on the ellipsoid method. This was the first polynomial time algorithm for linear programming. Early manuscripts These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the history of mathematics. Moscow Mathematical Papyrus This is one of the earliest mathematical treatises that still survives today. Rhind Mathematical Papyrus * Ahmes (scribe) One of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt. It was copied by the scribe Ahmes (properly Ahmose) from an older Middle Kingdom papyrus. It laid the foundations of Egyptian mathematics and in turn, later influenced Greek and Hellenistic mathematics. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of œÄ only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at squaring the circle and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the Egyptians deliberately built their pyramids to enshrine the value of œÄ in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the cotangent. Archimedes Palimpsest *Archimedes of Syracuse Although the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school geometry, he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using infinitesimals to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus. Among those problems were that of the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines. For explicit details of the method used, see Archimedes' use of infinitesimals. The Sand Reckoner *Archimedes of Syracuse Online version: Online version The first known (European) system of number-naming that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life. Textbooks Abstract Algebra * David Dummit and Richard Foote \\"Dummit and Foote has become the modern dominant abstract algebra textbook following Jacobson's Basic Algebra. Synopsis of Pure Mathematics * G. S. Carr Contains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training his students for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Studied extensively by Ramanujan. (first half here) √âl√©ments de math√©matique * Nicolas Bourbaki One of the most influential books in French mathematical literature. It introduces some of the notations and definitions that are now usual (the symbol ‚àÖ or the term bijective for example). Characterized by an extreme level of rigour, formalism and generality (up to the point of being highly criticized for that), its publication started in 1939 and is still unfinished today. Arithmetick: or, The Grounde of Arts * Robert Recorde Written in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language. Cocker's Arithmetick * Edward Cocker (authorship disputed) Textbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676. This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years. The Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical * Thomas Dilworth An early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in America in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections. Geometry *Andrei Kiselyov Publication data: 1892 The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and MAA review.) A Course of Pure Mathematics * G. H. Hardy A classic textbook in introductory mathematical analysis, written by G. H. Hardy. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge, and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge. As such, it was aimed directly at \\"scholarship level\\" students ‚Äì the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory calculus and the theory of infinite series. Moderne Algebra * B. L. van der Waerden The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether. First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag. A later English translation was published in 1949 by Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. Algebra * Saunders Mac Lane and Garrett Birkhoff A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a category theoretic approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field. Calculus, Vol. 1 * Tom M. Apostol Algebraic Geometry * Robin Hartshorne The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology. Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the functor of points. Naive Set Theory * Paul Halmos An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades. It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners. While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects. Where it differs from a \\"true\\" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long- winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like large cardinals. Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before. Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers * Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski The nec plus ultra reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers. If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years. Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs * Kenneth Kunen This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to forcing. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, Set Theory. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom. Topologie * Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov * Heinz Hopf First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering \\"reference\\" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory. General Topology * John L. Kelley First published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles. Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint * John Milnor This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style. While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details. Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre * Andr√© Weil An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field. The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre. The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners. An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers * G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers. Foundations of Differential Geometry *Shoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II * Claire Voisin Popular writings G√∂del, Escher, Bach * Douglas Hofstadter G√∂del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books. It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt G√∂del, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: \\"I realized that to me, G√∂del and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book.\\" The World of Mathematics * James R. Newman The World of Mathematics was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincar√©, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.

It may be useful if the country has contrary foreign and domestic policy goals or if it wants to take advantage of risk aversion to abet a deterrence strategy. Such a policy can be very risky as it may cause misinterpretation of a nation's intentions, leading to actions that contradict that nation's wishes.  China  There is deliberate ambiguity regarding the government of the country of 'China' (as well as what land this country constitutes). Currently, two governments claim legitimate rule and sovereignty over all of China, which they claim includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, as well as some other islands. The People's Republic of China (PRC) rules Mainland China under a one-party system and Hong Kong and Macau as special administrative regions, while the Republic of China (ROC) governs the Island of Taiwan as well as the Kinmen Islands, the Pescadores Islands and the Matsu Islands, which the ROC collectively refers to as the \\"Free area of the Republic of China\\". For further background, see Two Chinas, One-China policy and Cross- Strait relations. Owing to the controversial political status of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China's One-China policy, foreign governments have felt a need to be ambiguous regarding Taiwan. The PRC pressures states to recognize it as the sole legitimate representative of China, with which most states comply. In practice, however, most states maintain different levels of ambiguity on their attitudes to the Taiwan issue: see Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China and Foreign relations of the Republic of China. Starting with the 1979 Nagoya Resolution, an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, those from Taiwan who attend the Olympic Games and other various international organizations and events participate under the deliberately ambiguous name of \\"Chinese Taipei\\".  Iraq  Saddam Hussein employed a policy of intentional ambiguity about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction prior to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. He persisted in a ‚Äúcat and mouse‚Äù game with U.N. inspectors to try to avoid violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, while at the same time trying to ensure that the population and its neighbors (specifically Iran) still believed that Iraq may have weapons of mass destruction.  Israel  Israel is deliberately ambiguous as to whether or not it possesses nuclear weapons, which its commentators term \\"nuclear ambiguity\\" or \\"nuclear opacity\\". Most analysts agree that Israel is in possession of nuclear weapons. Israel also practices deliberate ambiguity over the issue of targeted killings and airstrikes. Prior to 2017, Israel almost never confirmed or denied whether Israel was involved in the deaths of suspected terrorists on foreign soil. However, with the onset of the Syrian Civil War (and Israel's involvement against Iran and Hezbollah), exceptions to its policy became more prominent. Israel acknowledged its intervention in missile strikes in military role in the war has been limited to missile strikes, which until 2017 were not officially acknowledged. Israel has made rare exceptions to this policy to deny involvement in certain killings in the Syrian Civil War.  Russia  In early April 2015, an editorial in the British newspaper The Times, with a reference to semi-official sources within the Russian military and intelligence establishment, opined that Russia's warnings of its alleged preparedness for a nuclear response to certain non-nuclear acts on the part of NATO, were to be construed as \\"an attempt to create strategic uncertainty\\" to undermine Western concerted security policy.  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom is deliberately ambiguous about whether its ballistic missile submarines would carry out a nuclear counter-attack in the event that the government were destroyed by a nuclear first strike. Upon taking office, the incoming Prime Minister issues sealed letters of last resort to the commanders of the submarines on what action to take in such circumstances.  United States  The United States has historically and presently had a policy of strategic ambiguity on several issues.  Taiwan  The oldest and longest running of the United States' deliberately ambiguous policies is whether and how it would defend the Republic of China on Taiwan in the event of an attack by the People's Republic of China (Mainland China). This issue is at the cornerstone of United States‚ÄìTaiwan relations and a central sticking point in United States‚ÄìChina relations. This policy was intended to discourage both a unilateral declaration of independence by ROC leaders and an invasion of Taiwan by the PRC. The United States seemingly abandoned strategic ambiguity in 2001 after then-President George W. Bush stated that he would \\"do whatever it takes\\" to defend Taiwan. He later used more ambiguous language, stating in 2003 that \\"The United States policy is one China\\".  Response to chemical or biological warfare  Another historic use of this policy is whether the United States would retaliate to a chemical or biological attack with nuclear weapons; specifically, during the Persian Gulf War. Related is the notion of a nuclear umbrella. Some commentators believe President Barack Obama broke US policy and damaged U.S. interests by failing to take sufficient action against the regime of Bashar al-Assad for its Ghouta chemical attack on civilians in the village of Ghouta near Damascus on August 21st, 2013. President Barack Obama had used the phrase \\"red line\\" in reference to the use of chemical weapons on August 20th, just one day prior. Specifically, Obama said: \\"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\\"  Nuclear weapons on surface ships  Since a passing a 1987 law, New Zealand has banned all nuclear powered means of war, whether nuclear weapons or nuclear powered propulsion from its sovereign territory; thereby making it a military nuclear-free zone. New Zealand has not banned civilian nuclear energy, but it is no longer used there and the public is quite opposed, thereby making it a de facto nuclear-free country. This ban includes its territorial waters as per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The U.S. is deliberately ambiguous as to whether certain United States Navy surface ships, such as destroyers, carry nuclear weapons. Further more, it is ambiguous about whether some of its ships are wholly or partially propelled by nuclear power. Therefore, New Zealand expelled United States Navy nuclear submarines and suspected nuclear-propelled surface ships from its waters. Because the U.S. would not comment on whether these ships were nuclear powered or not, this was an effective ban on the ships entry into New Zealand territory. In response, the United States partially suspended New Zealand from the ANZUS military alliance. President Ronald Reagan stated that New Zealand was \\"a friend, but not an ally\\". Finally, the United States also complies with Israel's deliberate ambiguity as to whether Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel is not a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Therefore, by not stating that Israel has nuclear weapons, the US avoids having to sanction it for violating American anti-proliferation law. East and West Germany After West Germany gave up its \\"Hallstein Doctrine\\" of ending diplomatic relations with any country recognizing East Germany (thus implicitly following a \\"one Germany policy\\"), West Germany turned to a policy of virtual/de facto recognizing East Germany in the 1970s, despite still maintaining several policies in accordance with the fictive but de jure legal principle of there being only one Germany. East German citizens were treated as West German citizens upon arrival in West Germany and exports to East Germany were treated as if they were domestic trade. That created a deliberately ambiguous policy that reconciled the demand by the rest of the world for West Germany to acknowledge the existence of East Germany and the desire by the vast majority of West German politicians to avoid recognizing German partition as permanent.

This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage. Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising. Once in the market, dogfooding demonstrates confidence in the developers' own products. Real world usage InfoWorld commented that this needs to be transparent and honest: \\"watered- down examples, such as auto dealers' policy of making salespeople drive the brands they sell, or Coca-Cola allowing no Pepsi products in corporate offices ... are irrelevant.\\" In this sense, a corporate culture of not supporting the competitor is not the same as a philosophy of \\"eating your own dog food\\". The latter focuses on the functional aspects of the company's own product. Dogfooding allows employees to test their company's products in real-life situations; a perceived, but still controversial, advantage beyond marketing, which gives management a sense of how the product might be used‚Äîall before launch to consumers. In software development, dogfooding can occur in multiple stages: first, a stable version of the software is used with just a single new feature added. Then, multiple new features can be combined into a single version of the software and tested together. This allows several validations before the software is released. The practice enables proactive resolution of potential inconsistency and dependency issues, especially when several developers or teams work on the same product. The risks of public dogfooding, specifically that a company may have difficulties using its own products, may reduce the frequency of publicized dogfooding. Origin of the term In 2006, the editor of IEEE Software recounted that in the 1970s television advertisements for Alpo dog food, Lorne Greene pointed out that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. Another possible origin he remembers is from the president of Kal Kan Pet Food, who was said to eat a can of his dog food at shareholders' meetings. In 1988, Microsoft manager Paul Maritz sent Brian Valentine, test manager for Microsoft LAN Manager, an email titled \\"Eating our own Dogfood\\", challenging him to increase internal usage of the company's product. From there, the usage of the term spread through the company.Inside Out: Microsoft‚ÄîIn Our Own Words () Quote: \\"[Paul] Maritz also poked fun at himself by claiming that one of his only contributions to the IT world is coining the commonly used \\"eat your own dog food\\" phrase. \\"You can read about it on Wikipedia, so it must be true,\\" Maritz said. Dave Cutler's February 1991 insistence on dogfooding in development of Windows NT at Microsoft was documented in Pascal Zachary's 1994 book, Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft. Microsoft developed the operating system on computers running NT daily builds, initially text only, then with graphics, and finally with networking. Examples In February 1980, Apple Computer president Michael Scott wrote a memo announcing \\"Effective Immediately!! No more typewriters are to be purchased, leased etc., etc. ... We believe the typewriter is obsolete. Let's prove it inside before we try and convince our customers.\\" He set a goal to remove all typewriters from the company by 1 January 1981. By 1987, Atari Corp. was in the process of using the Atari ST throughout the company. The development of Windows NT at Microsoft involved over 200 developers in small teams, and it was held together by Dave Cutler's February 1991 insistence on dogfooding. Microsoft developed the operating system on computers running NT daily builds. It was initially crash prone, but the immediate feedback of code breaking the build, the loss of pride, and the knowledge of impeding the work of others were all powerful motivators. Windows developers would typically dogfood or self-host Windows starting from the early (alpha) builds, while the rest of the employees would start from the more stable beta builds that were also available to MSDN subscribers. In 2005, InfoWorld reported that a tour of Microsoft's network operations center \\"showed pretty much beyond a reasonable doubt that Microsoft does run its 20,000-plus node, international network on 99 percent Windows technology, including servers, workstations, and edge security\\". InfoWorld argued that \\"Microsoft's use of Windows for its high- traffic operations tipped many doubters over to Windows' side of the fence.\\" In the mid-1990s, Microsoft's internal email system was initially developed around Unix. When asked why, they publicly moved to using Microsoft Exchange. In 1997, an email storm known as the Bedlam DL3 incident made Microsoft build more robust features into Microsoft Exchange Server to avoid lost and duplicate emails and network and server down-time, although dogfooding is rarely so dramatic. A second email storm in 2006\\"It's Bedlam all over again...\\" Larry Osterman's WebLog. 18 September 2006 in blogs.msdn.com was handled perfectly by the system. In 1999, Hewlett-Packard staff referred to a project using HP's own products as \\"Project Alpo\\". Note: Alpo is a brand of dog food. Around the same time, Mozilla also practised dogfooding under that exact name. Government green public procurement that allows testing of proposed environmental policies has been compared to dogfooding. On 1 June 2011, YouTube added a license feature to its video uploading service allowing users to choose between a standard or Creative Commons license. The license label was followed by the message (Shh! ‚Äì Internal Dogfood) that appeared on all YouTube videos lacking commercial licensing. A YouTube employee confirmed that this referred to products that are tested internally. Oracle Corporation stated that it \\"runs Oracle Linux with more than 42,000 servers [to] support more than 4 million external users and 84,000 internal users. More than 20,000 developers at Oracle use Oracle Linux\\". Criticisms and support Forcing those who design products to actually use and rely on them is sometimes thought to improve quality and usability, but software developers may be blind to usability and may have knowledge to make software work that an end user will lack. Microsoft's chief information officer noted in 2008 that, previously, \\"We tended not to go through the actual customer experience. We were always upgrading from a beta, not from production disk to production disk.\\" Dogfooding may happen too early to be viable, and those forced to use the products may assume that someone else has reported the problem or they may get used to applying workarounds. Dogfooding may be unrealistic, as customers will always have a choice of different companies' products to use together, and the product may not be used as intended. The process can lead to a loss of productivity and demoralisation, or at its extreme to \\"Not Invented Here\\" syndrome, i.e. only using internal products. In 1989, Donald Knuth published a paper recounting lessons from the development of his TeX Typesetting software, in which the benefits of the approach were mentioned: Alternative terms In 2007, Jo Hoppe, the CIO of Pegasystems, said that she uses the alternative phrase \\"drinking our own champagne\\". Novell's head of public relations Bruce Lowry, commenting on his company's use of Linux and OpenOffice.org, said that he also prefers this phrase. In 2009, the new CIO of Microsoft, Tony Scott, argued that the phrase \\"dogfooding\\" was unappealing and should be replaced by \\"icecreaming\\", with the aim of developing products as \\"ice cream that our customers want to consume\\". A less controversial and common alternative term used in some contexts is self-hosting, where developers' workstations would, for instance, get updated automatically overnight to the latest daily build of the software or operating system on which they work. Developers of IBM's mainframe operating systems have long used the term \\"eating our own cooking\\".

Dutch, monolingual French or bilingual depending on their nature. University hospitals belong to one of the two linguistic communities and are therefore monolingual Dutch or French by law. Other public hospitals managed by a public authority have to be bilingual by law. Private hospitals not managed by a public authority are legally not bound to either language, but most cater to both. However, all hospital emergency services in the Brussels-Capital Region (no matter if they're part of a public or private hospital) are required to be bilingual, since patients transported by emergency ambulance do not have a free choice to which hospital they will be brought. Mind that this is only the de iure situation, de facto are some hospitals that are legally required to be bilingual seriously lacking in personnel that's proficient in the other language. This list indicates whether hospitals or hospital networks are officially monolingual or bilingual. The name of the bilingual hospitals is also given in the two languages. Additionally, hospitals where younger members of the Belgian royal family were born are indicated with an asterisk (*).

About long, it begins and ends in Lincoln County but also flows briefly through western Polk and southern Tillamook counties. Much of its course lies within the Siuslaw National Forest. Rising in the mountains near the Lincoln-Polk county line, it flows east into Polk County, then north and west, re-entering Lincoln County, entering Tillamook County and re-entering Lincoln County near Oregon Route 18. It continues generally west-southwestward through the Siuslaw National Forest, turning west again to enter the Pacific near Cascade Head, about north of Lincoln City. Following the river through the mountains, Route 18 connects to Sheridan, McMinnville and the South Yamhill River valley to the east and U.S. Route 101 to the west. The river and highway pass through the Van Duzer Forest Corridor State Wayside. The river supports populations of wild steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout, as well as chinook and coho salmon released each year from a hatchery at Otis.

It was issued by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (from 1220) and King of Sicily (from 1198), and was minted until his death in 1250. In addition, a half augustalis was issued. It was identical in design, but smaller and half the weight. The augustalis bore a Latin inscription and was widely circulated in Italy. It was patterned after the Roman aureus. (2008). Retrieved 7 October 2008. It was struck at Brindisi and Messina with accompanying billon deniers. The style of the augustalis has been described as splendid and proto-Renaissance; the quality of its execution and its fineness was high. The augustalis had a nominal weight of 5.31 grams and was 20 carats (854/1000) fine. The legal value was a quarter of a Sicilian gold ounce. The obverse contains a classical (not medieval) profile bust of the emperor wearing a laureate wreath with the legend CESAR AVG IMP ROM (Caesar Augustus, Emperor of the Romans); the reverse shows an eagle, the imperial symbol, with the name FRIDE RICVS (Frederick). [Erratum: CESAR AVG misquoted as CESAVG.] [Errata: Gold content of 4.33g should read 4.53g; obverse referred to as reverse, and vice versa; CESAR misquoted as CAESAR.] The name augustalis means literally \\"of the august one\\", referring to the coin's provenance from the emperor himself, but also linking it with the Roman Emperor, who was commonly styled Augustus.

It is a remake of the British film The Big Job (1965). The film was shot on location in California. The prime shooting spot was Sony Pictures Studios, which is located in Culver City, California. The film was released in September 1999 and opened as the number one movie in North America. It went on to gross nearly US$120 million at the worldwide box office. The film's soundtrack album, featuring a number of popular urban/hip-hop artists, was certified platinum. Plot Jewel thief Miles Logan participates in a $17 million diamond heist in Los Angeles. One of his accomplices, Deacon, turns on Miles and kills Eddie, Miles' best friend and another member of the team, before attempting to take the stone from Miles. The police arrive and Miles is forced to hide the diamond in the ductwork of a building being constructed. Deacon flees and Miles is arrested, and as Miles is being taken away he is horrified to discover that Eddie has been killed. Two years later, Miles is released from prison and attempts to reconnect with his girlfriend. She dumps him for lying to her about his criminal life, and Miles decides to go retrieve the diamond. He is dismayed to find that the building he hid the diamond in is now an LAPD police station. He goes inside and discovers that the stone is hidden in what is now the Robbery/Homicide detective bureau, which requires a key card to access. Miles returns later on disguised as an eccentric pizza deliveryman. While unable to gain access to the ducts, he does manage to steal an access card. Miles visits his forger Uncle Lou, who creates a fake badge and transfer papers that allow Miles to enter the building posing as a newly transferred Detective Malone. While trying to access the ducts, Miles inadvertently foils a prisoner escape and is teamed up with Detective Carlson. The pair are sent out on a burglary call, where Miles quickly solves it as a fraud perpetrated by the owner. On the ride back, they stumble upon an armed robbery being committed by Miles' good friend and former getaway driver Tulley. Miles intervenes and arrests Tulley before the police can shoot him, but Tulley demands $50,000 to keep quiet about who Miles really is. Miles makes another attempt to locate the diamond but is interrupted by Carlson, who has discovered that Miles isn't who he claims to be. Miles convinces Carlson that he is from Internal Affairs. Miles tries to get back to searching for the diamond but he and Carlson are sent out on another call. While out, they capture a truckload of heroin belonging to a major dealer. Miles locates the diamond in the vent inside the evidence locker and finally retrieves it, but accidentally drops it into the load of heroin they seized. The FBI arrives and demands the heroin be turned over to them for testing. A panicked Miles suggests the FBI and his cops unit use the heroin as bait in a sting. He arranges to be with the heroin in the delivery truck, but is soon joined by Tulley (who he secretly set free from holding) and Deacon. During the drug deal, Deacon tries to expose Miles as a cop to the drug runners. While Miles and Tulley attempt to distract the dealers, the police and FBI raid the deal. Deacon escapes with the diamond in an armored truck and the police and FBI follow as he approaches the border to Mexico. The police and FBI are forced to halt their pursuit at the border, but Miles steals a patrol car and continues after Deacon. Miles forces Deacon to wreck the truck and then offers him a deal: Deacon gives Miles the diamond and allows Miles to arrest him and in exchange Miles takes him back to the United States and cuts him back in on the diamond. Deacon agrees, and Miles immediately double-crosses him by handcuffing him to the wrecked truck for the Federales to find. Deacon draws a gun to shoot Miles but Miles turns and shoots him first, killing him and avenging Eddie's death. Miles walks back the US side of the border where the FBI demands he explain his actions. The police also want to know who he's working for as his fake credentials didn't check out. Miles tells them he's an undercover Mexican officer, and has to get back to Mexico to explain everything to his fellow Federales. Miles gets a few inches over the border when Carlson and Hardcastle stop him and reveal that they know who Miles really is. However, they don't arrest him as they are grateful for all of his help and look at him as a friend. They jokingly state the FBI are strict about integrating people over international borders although Miles is only a few inches over the border. The three men share a bittersweet goodbye, before Miles heads off into Mexico with the diamond.

It deals largely with Jewish criminal and civil law and the Jewish court system. Nezikin contains ten volumes (or \\"tractates\\"): #Bava Kamma (, First Gate) deals with civil matters, largely damages and compensation. 10 chapters. (See also Shomer) #Bava Metzia (, Middle Gate) deals with civil matters, largely torts and property law. 10 chapters. #Bava Batra (, Last Gate) deals with civil matters, largely land ownership. 10 chapters. #Sanhedrin (, The Sanhedrin) deals with the rules of court proceedings in the Sanhedrin, the death penalty, and other criminal matters. 11 chapters. #Makkot (, Lashes) deals with collusive witnesses, cities of refuge and the punishment of lashes. 3 chapters. #Shevu'ot (, Oaths) deals with the various types of oaths and their consequences. 8 chapters. #Eduyot (, Testimonies) presents case studies of legal disputes in Mishnaic times and the miscellaneous testimonies that illustrate various Sages and principles of halakha. 8 chapters. #Avodah Zarah (, Foreign worship) deals with the laws of interactions between Jews and Gentiles and/or idolaters (from a Jewish perspective). 5 chapters. #Avot (, Fathers) is a collection of the Sages' favourite ethical maxims. 6 chapters. #Horayot (, Decisions) deals with the communal sin-offering brought for major errors by the Sanhedrin. 3 chapters. Originally, the first three volumes were counted as one single, very lengthy volume. Since it was the chief repository of \\"civil\\" law, it was simply called Massekhet Nezikin (\\"Tractate Damages\\"). The traditional reasoning for the order of the volumes of Nezikin is as follows: The Order begins with civil law (the first 3 tractates) because it is considered the cornerstone of righteousness within a Jewish state. Sanhedrin naturally follows, as it deals with criminal law. Next comes Makkot, as it is a continuation of Sanhedrin's subject matter in terms of criminal procedure. Then, Shevuot, which continues the general topic dealt with in Makkot of the false testimony. After outlining the main points of civil and criminal law, Eduyot follows to fit it all into a halakhic framework. After dealing with \\"damages\\" within a society, the next stage is Avodah Zarah placed after to highlight what is seen as behavior that inflicts damage on the universe. Avot is probably placed next to counteract the negativity of the laws of Avodah Zarah and to relate maxims of the Sages, an essential aspect of whose teaching was to counteract idolatry. Finally, Horayot brings the discussion from lofty heights to a humble note, highlighting the concept that even the Sages and battei din can err. There is both a Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud to each of the tractates except for Eduyot and Avot. This is probably because these two tractates aren't concerned with individual laws and therefore don't lend themselves to a Gemara style analysis.

This order deals with the clean/unclean distinction and family purity. This is the longest of the orders in the Mishnah. There are 12 tractates: #Keilim: (◊õ◊ú◊ô◊ù \\"Vessels\\"); deals with a large array of various utensils and how they fare in terms of purity. 30 chapters, the longest in the Mishnah. #Oholot: (◊ê◊ï◊î◊ú◊ï◊™ \\"Tents\\"); deals with the uncleanness from a corpse and its peculiar property of defiling people or objects either by the latter \\"tenting\\" over the corpse, or by the corpse \\"tenting\\" over them, or by the presence of both corpse and person or object under the same roof or tent. #Nega'im: (◊†◊í◊¢◊ô◊ù \\"Plagues\\"); deals with the laws of the tzaraath. #Parah: (◊§◊®◊î \\"Cow\\"); deals largely with the laws of the Red Heifer (Para Adumah). #Tohorot: (◊ò◊î◊®◊ï◊™ \\"Purities\\"); deals with miscellaneous laws of purity, especially the actual mechanics of contracting impurity and the laws of the impurity of food. #Mikva'ot: (◊û◊ß◊ï◊ê◊ï◊™ \\"Ritual Baths\\"); deals with the laws of the mikveh. #Niddah: (◊†◊ô◊ì◊î \\"Separation\\"); deals with the Niddah, a woman either during her menstrual cycle or shortly after having given birth. #Makhshirin: (◊û◊õ◊©◊ô◊®◊ô◊ü \\"Preliminary acts of preparation\\"), the liquids that make food susceptible to tumah (ritual impurity). #Zavim: (◊ñ◊ë◊ô◊ù \\"Flows\\"); deals with the laws of a person who has had abnormal genital discharge. #Tevul Yom: (◊ò◊ë◊ï◊ú ◊ô◊ï◊ù \\"Immersed [on that] day\\") deals with a special kind of impurity where the person immerses in a mikveh but is still unclean for the rest of the day. #Yadayim: (◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ù \\"Hands\\"); deals with a Rabbinic impurity related to the hands. #Uktzim: (◊¢◊ï◊ß◊¶◊ô◊ù \\"Stalks\\"); deals with the impurity of the stalks of fruit. Order of tractates The traditional reasoning for the order of the tractates (according to Rambam) is as follows. Kelim is first as it introduces the levels of impurity, and dictates to which object the various impurities apply at all. Oholot follows because it outlines the most serious type of impurity. Negaim follows because it is next in severity and because, like a corpse, a metzorah transmits tent-impurity. Parah follows as it outlines the purification for the severe impurities already dealt with. The next stage is lesser impurities (Tohorot) and their method of purification which is immersion (Mikvaot). Niddah follows as it is also a lesser impurity but it has the extra feature of applying to only a portion of people (i.e. to women). Makshirin, Zavim and Tevul Tom follow Niddah based on Scriptural order. The next stage down is impurities that are Rabbinic only (Yadaim). Finally, Uktzin is last as it is restricted and has no Scriptural source, the laws being derived from the reasoning of the Sages. The Jewish Encyclopedia on the other hand observed that the tractates are arranged in order of decreasing length. There is a Babylonian Gemara on only Niddah. This is because most of the other laws of purity do not apply when the Temple is not in existence. The Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud) only covers four chapters of Niddah.

Finland List Hospitals ","title":"List of hospitals in Finland"},{"id":"708503","text":"Latah, from Southeast Asia, is a condition in which abnormal behaviors result from a person experiencing a sudden shock. When surprised, the affected person typically engages in such behaviors as screaming, cursing, dance movements, and uncontrollable laughter, and will typically mimic the words or actions of those around them. Physical symptoms include an increased heart rate and profuse sweating, but no clear physiological source has been identified. Latah is considered a culture-specific startle disorder that was historically regarded as personal difference rather than an illness. Similar conditions have been recorded within other cultures and locations. For example, there are the so-called Jumping Frenchmen of Maine, imu among women of the Ainu people of Japan, mali-mali or silok among Filipinos, and bat-schi among Thais; however, the connection among these syndromes is controversial. Earliest record The earliest mention of latah is in J. R. Logan's journal from 1849 when he traveled from Melaka to Naning. Though this is only a possible reference, by the 1860s, latah had been clearly identified in Malaya and Java. Seen first as merely a \\"cerebral affection\\", little was understood about latah during this time. O'Brien's notes from the early‚Äì to mid‚Äì1880s are the first gathering of information on latah recorded. He observed that latah was more common in women than men, and more likely to occur in more mature, rather than younger, women.Gimlette, J. D. (21 August 1897). \\"Remarks on the Etiology, Symptoms, and Treatment of Latah, with a Report of Two Cases\\" [Electronic version]. British Medical Journal, 455-457. From many of the original accounts of European travelers, latah does not seem to have changed much in either affected demographic population nor in symptoms. The British colonial administrator Frank Swettenham wrote about latah in his volume of essays Malay Sketches (1895). Swettenham describes how two policemen from Ambon Island stationed in Selangor in 1874 who were affected with the condition were made the victims of pranks by their colleagues. Signs and symptoms Latah can affect people differently; someone can have a very strong reaction or a slight reaction during a latah episode. Every instance of latah has been acquired over time. Those who are affected, which by an overwhelming number are middle- aged to older women, are not born latah. It typically occurs around the time of menopause. There is a lack of latah in the higher social strata of Malay and Java, which suggests they are more likely to suppress their responses than those who belong to lower social classes. A latah episode occurs after being startled (poking, shouting, something falling). During an episode, a latah person will begin to shout obscenities, imitate words or gestures of those around them or even those on TV, and will often obey any commands given to them ‚Äì no matter how outrageous or against cultural norms they are. Persons with latah make movements reminiscent of behaviors normally peculiar to certain childhood developmental stages. The person is unlikely to remember anything occurring during the episode. Malay perspective When Malays were asked why they thought that women were more likely to suffer from latah, they responded with the cultural explanation that women have less \\"semangat\\" or soul substance. They also said women are simply easier to tease than men, and coupling these two together, latah becomes more readily observable and developed throughout recurrent provocation in women than in men. This also accounts for the higher prevalence of latah in lower status persons, as they are more vulnerable to abuse than others. The Malay also believe women are more susceptible because they lose more blood than men, through menstruation. Some Malay believe that excess tickling of a child will predispose them to latah later in life.Simons, R. C. (2001, November 1). \\"Introduction to Culture-Bound Syndromes\\". In Psychiatric Times. Retrieved April 6, 2016. In the DSM Latah was included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV under the \\"Dissociative Disorder: Not Otherwise Specified\\" section as a culture‚Äìbound syndrome. DSM IV describes latah as a hypersensitivity to sudden fright, often with echopraxia, echolalia, command obedience, and dissociative or trancelike behavior. It mentions other cultures where latah is found, but the only further information the DSM IV gives us is that in Malaysia, it is more often found in middle‚Äìaged women. It has been removed from DSM 5, and rather than the DSM 5 expanding upon the DSM IV's list of culture‚Äìbound syndromes, it has instead provided cross-lists for more commonly known disorders that a culture-bound syndrome might be classified as. DSM 5 has taken out the \\"culture‚Äìbound syndrome\\" language and replaced it with more \\"sensitive\\" language, and the glossary where the now shortened list of previously recognized culture‚Äìbound syndromes is titled \\"Other Specified\\" and \\"Unspecified\\" dissociative disorders. A more general discussion, involving the formation of a cultural identity, explanation, and assessment, has been added. In popular culture William S. Burroughs mentions latah several times in his 1959 novel Naked Lunch, \\"a parody of modern mass man under modern conditioning programmes of advertising and public[ly] induced morality\\", according to Eric Mottram.Parkingson A.D., Giving Away the Basic American Root[ed]ness Burroughs described latah as involving echopraxia, as well as being forcibly induced rather than spontaneously occurring. Latah is also mentioned in Burroughs' 1963 novel The Yage Letters. Possible causes The onset of latah is often associated with stress. In a study done by Tanner and Chamberland in 2001, a significant number of research participants had experienced a life stressor (such as a child or husband dying) just before becoming latah. Additionally, a large number of participants from many research studies have reported strange dreams occurring just before the onset of latah. These dreams usually had a sexual element to them, often involving penises or enlarged penises. According to Tanner and Chamberland, perhaps the dreams, although with variation, indicate some sort of dysfunction in a specific anatomical area. Exploring this further might lead to more insights as to the cause and/or cure of latah. Osborne (2001) states that latah is a possible emotional outlet in a stifling culture.Osborne, L. (2001, May). \\"Regional Disturbances\\". New York Times. Retrieved April 6, 2016. Winzeler's believes that latah is less demeaning for women than it is for men, and that women actually have more freedom in society because they are not held to as strict of standards as men are. He argues that as men age, they become more concerned with personal dignity and poise while women become less so. Because of this, women feel more freedom to engage in latah behavior, while men do not.

WWOOF volunteers generally do not receive money in exchange for services. The host provides food, lodging, and opportunities to learn, in exchange for assistance with farming or gardening activities. The duration of the visit can range from a few days to years. Workdays average five to six hours, and participants interact with WWOOFers from other countries. WWOOF farms include private gardens through smallholdings, allotments, and commercial farms. Farms become WWOOF hosts by enlisting with their national organization.

Sue Coppard, a woman working as a secretary in London, wanted to provide urban dwellers with access to the countryside, while supporting the organic movement. Her idea started with trial working weekends for four people at the biodynamic farm at Emerson College in Sussex. People soon started volunteering for longer periods than just weekends, so the name was changed to Willing Workers On Organic Farms, but then the word \\"work\\" caused problems with some countries' labour laws and immigration authorities, who tended to treat WWOOFers as migrant workers and oppose foreigners competing for local jobs. (Many WWOOFers enter countries on tourist visas, which is illegal in countries such as the United States.) Both in an attempt to circumvent this and also in recognition of WWOOFing's worldwide scope, the name was changed again in 2000 to World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. Some WWOOF groups (such as Australia) choose to retain the older name, however. Volunteering Volunteers choose what country they would like to visit and volunteer in and contact arrange the dates and duration of their stay at selected farms. The duration of a volunteer's stay can range from days to months, but is typically one to two weeks. Volunteers can expect to work for 4‚Äì6 hours a day for a full day's food and accommodation. Volunteers could be asked to help with a variety of tasks, including: sowing seed, making compost, gardening, planting, cutting wood, weeding, harvesting, packing, milking, feeding, fencing, making mud- bricks, wine making, cheese making and bread baking.

For small or special purpose engines, cooling using air from the atmosphere makes for a lightweight and relatively simple system. Watercraft can use water directly from the surrounding environment to cool their engines. For water-cooled engines on aircraft and surface vehicles, waste heat is transferred from a closed loop of water pumped through the engine to the surrounding atmosphere by a radiator. Water has a higher heat capacity than air, and can thus move heat more quickly away from the engine, but a radiator and pumping system add weight, complexity, and cost. Higher-power engines generate more waste heat, but can move more weight, meaning they are generally water-cooled. Radial engines allow air to flow around each cylinder directly, giving them an advantage for air cooling over straight engines, flat engines, and V engines. Rotary engines have a similar configuration, but the cylinders also continually rotate, creating an air flow even when the vehicle is stationary. Aircraft design more strongly favors lower weight and air-cooled designs. Rotary engines were popular on aircraft until the end of World War I, but had serious stability and efficiency problems. Radial engines were popular until the end of World War II, until gas turbine engines largely replaced them. Modern propeller- driven aircraft with internal-combustion engines are still largely air-cooled. Modern cars generally favor power over weight, and typically have water-cooled engines. Modern motorcycles are lighter than cars, and both cooling fluids are common. Some sport motorcycles were cooled with both air and oil (sprayed underneath the piston heads).  Overview  Heat engines generate mechanical power by extracting energy from heat flows, much as a water wheel extracts mechanical power from a flow of mass falling through a distance. Engines are inefficient, so more heat energy enters the engine than comes out as mechanical power; the difference is waste heat which must be removed. Internal combustion engines remove waste heat through cool intake air, hot exhaust gases, and explicit engine cooling. Engines with higher efficiency have more energy leave as mechanical motion and less as waste heat. Some waste heat is essential: it guides heat through the engine, much as a water wheel works only if there is some exit velocity (energy) in the waste water to carry it away and make room for more water. Thus, all heat engines need cooling to operate. Cooling is also needed because high temperatures damage engine materials and lubricants and becomes even more important in hot climates. Internal- combustion engines burn fuel hotter than the melting temperature of engine materials, and hot enough to set fire to lubricants. Engine cooling removes energy fast enough to keep temperatures low so the engine can survive. Some high-efficiency engines run without explicit cooling and with only incidental heat loss, a design called adiabatic. Such engines can achieve high efficiency but compromise power output, duty cycle, engine weight, durability, and emissions.  Basic principles  Most internal combustion engines are fluid cooled using either air (a gaseous fluid) or a liquid coolant run through a heat exchanger (radiator) cooled by air. Marine engines and some stationary engines have ready access to a large volume of water at a suitable temperature. The water may be used directly to cool the engine, but often has sediment, which can clog coolant passages, or chemicals, such as salt, that can chemically damage the engine. Thus, engine coolant may be run through a heat exchanger that is cooled by the body of water. Most liquid-cooled engines use a mixture of water and chemicals such as antifreeze and rust inhibitors. The industry term for the antifreeze mixture is engine coolant. Some antifreezes use no water at all, instead using a liquid with different properties, such as propylene glycol or a combination of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Most \\"air-cooled\\" engines use some liquid oil cooling, to maintain acceptable temperatures for both critical engine parts and the oil itself. Most \\"liquid-cooled\\" engines use some air cooling, with the intake stroke of air cooling the combustion chamber. An exception is Wankel engines, where some parts of the combustion chamber are never cooled by intake, requiring extra effort for successful operation. There are many demands on a cooling system. One key requirement is to adequately serve the entire engine, as the whole engine fails if just one part overheats. Therefore, it is vital that the cooling system keep all parts at suitably low temperatures. Liquid- cooled engines are able to vary the size of their passageways through the engine block so that coolant flow may be tailored to the needs of each area. Locations with either high peak temperatures (narrow islands around the combustion chamber) or high heat flow (around exhaust ports) may require generous cooling. This reduces the occurrence of hot spots, which are more difficult to avoid with air cooling. Air-cooled engines may also vary their cooling capacity by using more closely spaced cooling fins in that area, but this can make their manufacture difficult and expensive. Only the fixed parts of the engine, such as the block and head, are cooled directly by the main coolant system. Moving parts such as the pistons, and to a lesser extent the crank and rods, must rely on the lubrication oil as a coolant, or to a very limited amount of conduction into the block and thence the main coolant. High performance engines frequently have additional oil, beyond the amount needed for lubrication, sprayed upwards onto the bottom of the piston just for extra cooling. Air-cooled motorcycles often rely heavily on oil-cooling in addition to air-cooling of the cylinder barrels. Liquid-cooled engines usually have a circulation pump. The first engines relied on thermo-syphon cooling alone, where hot coolant left the top of the engine block and passed to the radiator, where it was cooled before returning to the bottom of the engine. Circulation was powered by convection alone. Other demands include cost, weight, reliability, and durability of the cooling system itself. Conductive heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between materials. If engine metal is at 250 ¬∞C and the air is at 20 ¬∞C, then there is a 230 ¬∞C temperature difference for cooling. An air-cooled engine uses all of this difference. In contrast, a liquid-cooled engine might dump heat from the engine to a liquid, heating the liquid to 135 ¬∞C (Water's standard boiling point of 100 ¬∞C can be exceeded as the cooling system is both pressurised, and uses a mixture with antifreeze) which is then cooled with 20 ¬∞C air. In each step, the liquid-cooled engine has half the temperature difference and so at first appears to need twice the cooling area. However, properties of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. As example, comparing water and oil as coolants, one gram of oil can absorb about 55% of the heat for the same rise in temperature (called the specific heat capacity). Oil has about 90% the density of water, so a given volume of oil can absorb only about 50% of the energy of the same volume of water. The thermal conductivity of water is about four times that of oil, which can aid heat transfer. The viscosity of oil can be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to pump oil for cooling, and reducing the net power output of the engine. Comparing air and water, air has vastly lower heat capacity per gram and per volume (4000) and less than a tenth the conductivity, but also much lower viscosity (about 200 times lower: 17.4 √ó 10‚àí6 Pa¬∑s for air vs 8.94 √ó 10‚àí4 Pa¬∑s for water). Continuing the calculation from two paragraphs above, air cooling needs ten times of the surface area, therefore the fins, and air needs 2000 times the flow velocity and thus a recirculating air fan needs ten times the power of a recirculating water pump. Moving heat from the cylinder to a large surface area for air cooling can present problems such as difficulties manufacturing the shapes needed for good heat transfer and the space needed for free flow of a large volume of air. Water boils at about the same temperature desired for engine cooling. This has the advantage that it absorbs a great deal of energy with very little rise in temperature (called heat of vaporization), which is good for keeping things cool, especially for passing one stream of coolant over several hot objects and achieving uniform temperature. In contrast, passing air over several hot objects in series warms the air at each step, so the first may be over-cooled and the last under- cooled. However, once water boils, it is an insulator, leading to a sudden loss of cooling where steam bubbles form (for more, see heat transfer). Steam may return to water as it mixes with other coolant, so an engine temperature gauge can indicate an acceptable temperature even though local temperatures are high enough that damage is being done. An engine needs different temperatures. The inlet including the compressor of a turbo and in the inlet trumpets and the inlet valves need to be as cold as possible. A countercurrent heat exchange with forced cooling air does the job. The cylinder-walls should not heat up the air before compression, but also not cool down the gas at the combustion. A compromise is a wall temperature of 90 ¬∞C. The viscosity of the oil is optimized for just this temperature. Any cooling of the exhaust and the turbine of the turbocharger reduces the amount of power available to the turbine, so the exhaust system is often insulated between engine and turbocharger to keep the exhaust gases as hot as possible. The temperature of the cooling air may range from well below freezing to 50 ¬∞C. Further, while engines in long-haul boat or rail service may operate at a steady load, road vehicles often see widely varying and quickly varying load. Thus, the cooling system is designed to vary cooling so the engine is neither too hot nor too cold. Cooling system regulation includes adjustable baffles in the air flow (sometimes called 'shutters' and commonly run by a pneumatic 'shutterstat); a fan which operates either independently of the engine, such as an electric fan, or which has an adjustable clutch; a thermostatic valve or just 'thermostat' that can block the coolant flow when too cool. In addition, the motor, coolant, and heat exchanger have some heat capacity which smooths out temperature increase in short sprints. Some engine controls shut down an engine or limit it to half throttle if it overheats. Modern electronic engine controls adjust cooling based on throttle to anticipate a temperature rise, and limit engine power output to compensate for finite cooling. Finally, other concerns may dominate cooling system design. As example, air is a relatively poor coolant, but air cooling systems are simple, and failure rates typically rise as the square of the number of failure points. Also, cooling capacity is reduced only slightly by small air coolant leaks. Where reliability is of utmost importance, as in aircraft, it may be a good trade-off to give up efficiency, longevity (interval between engine rebuilds), and quietness in order to achieve slightly higher reliability; the consequences of a broken airplane engine are so severe, even a slight increase in reliability is worth giving up other good properties to achieve it. Air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines are both used commonly. Each principle has advantages and disadvantages, and particular applications may favor one over the other. For example, most cars and trucks use liquid-cooled engines, while many small airplane and low-cost engines are air-cooled.  Generalization difficulties  It is difficult to make generalizations about air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines. Air-cooled diesel engines are chosen for reliability even in extreme heat, because air-cooling would be simpler and more effective at coping with the extremes of temperatures during the depths of winter and height of summer, than water cooling systems, and are often used in situations where the engine runs unattended for months at a time. Similarly, it is usually desirable to minimize the number of heat transfer stages in order to maximize the temperature difference at each stage. However, Detroit Diesel two-stroke cycle engines commonly use oil cooled by water, with the water in turn cooled by air. The coolant used in many liquid-cooled engines must be renewed periodically, and can freeze at ordinary temperatures thus causing permanent engine damage when it expands. Air-cooled engines do not require coolant service, and do not suffer damage from freezing, two commonly cited advantages for air-cooled engines. However, coolant based on propylene glycol is liquid to ‚àí55 ¬∞C, colder than is encountered by many engines; shrinks slightly when it crystallizes, thus avoiding damage; and has a service life over 10,000 hours, essentially the lifetime of many engines. It is usually more difficult to achieve either low emissions or low noise from an air-cooled engine, two more reasons most road vehicles use liquid-cooled engines. It is also often difficult to build large air-cooled engines, so nearly all air-cooled engines are under 500 kW (670 hp), whereas large liquid-cooled engines exceed 80 MW (107000 hp) (W√§rtsil√§-Sulzer RTA96-C 14-cylinder diesel).  Air-cooling A cylinder from an air-cooled aviation engine, a Continental C85. Notice the rows of fins on both the steel cylinder barrel and the aluminum cylinder head. The fins provide additional surface area for air to pass over the cylinder and absorb heat. Cars and trucks using direct air cooling (without an intermediate liquid) were built over a long period from the very beginning and ending with a small and generally unrecognized technical change. Before World War II, water-cooled cars and trucks routinely overheated while climbing mountain roads, creating geysers of boiling cooling water. This was considered normal, and at the time, most noted mountain roads had auto repair shops to minister to overheating engines. ACS (Auto Club Suisse) maintains historical monuments to that era on the Susten Pass where two radiator refill stations remain. These have instructions on a cast metal plaque and a spherical bottom watering can hanging next to a water spigot. The spherical bottom was intended to keep it from being set down and, therefore, be useless around the house, in spite of which it was stolen, as the picture shows. During that period, European firms such as Magirus-Deutz built air-cooled diesel trucks, Porsche built air- cooled farm tractors,\\"Porsche Diesel .\\" March 20, 2008. and Volkswagen became famous with air-cooled passenger cars. In the United States, Franklin built air-cooled engines. For many years air cooling was favored for military applications as liquid cooling systems are more vulnerable to damage by shrapnel. The Czech Republic‚Äìbased company Tatra is known for their large displacement air-cooled V8 car engines; Tatra engineer Julius Mackerle published a book on it. Air-cooled engines are better adapted to extremely cold and hot environmental weather temperatures: you can see air-cooled engines starting and running in freezing conditions that seized water-cooled engines and continue working when water-cooled ones start producing steam jets. Air-cooled engines have may be an advantage from a thermodynamic point of view due to higher operating temperature. The worst problem met in air- cooled aircraft engines was the so-called \\"Shock cooling\\", when the airplane entered in a dive after climbing or level flight with throttle open, with the engine under no load while the airplane dives generating less heat, and the flow of air that cools the engine is increased, a catastrophic engine failure may result as different parts of engine have different temperatures, and thus different thermal expansions. In such conditions, the engine may seize, and any sudden change or imbalance in the relation between heat produced by the engine and heat dissipated by cooling may result in an increased wear of engine, as a consequence also of thermal expansion differences between parts of engine, liquid-cooled engines having more stable and uniform working temperatures. Liquid cooling A typical engine coolant radiator used in an automobile Coolant being poured into the radiator of an automobile Today, most automotive and larger IC engines are liquid-cooled. A fully closed IC engine cooling system Open IC engine cooling system Semi-closed IC engine cooling system Liquid cooling is also employed in maritime vehicles (vessels, ...). For vessels, the seawater itself is mostly used for cooling. In some cases, chemical coolants are also employed (in closed systems) or they are mixed with seawater cooling.Marine cooling systems overview Transition from air cooling The change of air cooling to liquid cooling occurred at the start of World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived durability tests, but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated \\"rope\\" seal (gland) on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water to the top of the radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden. After isolating the pump problem, cars and trucks built for the war effort (no civilian cars were built during that time) were equipped with carbon-seal water pumps that did not leak and caused no more geysers. Meanwhile, air cooling advanced in memory of boiling engines... even though boil-over was no longer a common problem. Air-cooled engines became popular throughout Europe. After the war, Volkswagen advertised in the USA as not boiling over, even though new water-cooled cars no longer boiled over, but these cars sold well. But as air quality awareness rose in the 1960s, and laws governing exhaust emissions were passed, unleaded gas replaced leaded gas and leaner fuel mixtures became the norm. Subaru chose liquid-cooling for their EA series (flat) engine when it was introduced in 1966. Low heat rejection engines A special class of experimental prototype internal combustion piston engines have been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss. These engines are variously called adiabatic engines, due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion, low heat rejection engines, or high-temperature engines. They are generally diesel engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Some make use of titanium pistons and other titanium parts due to its low thermal conductivity and mass. Some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether. Developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization.

Bortniansky was critical to the musical history of both Ukraine and Russia, with both nations claiming him as their own. Bortniansky, who has been compared to Palestrina,Rzhevsky, Nicholas: The Cambridge Companion to Modern Russian Culture. Cambridge 1998. P. 239. is known today for his liturgical works and his prolific contributions to the genre of choral concertos. He was one of the \\"Golden Three\\" of his era, alongside Artemy Vedel and Maxim Berezovsky. Bortniansky was so popular in the Russian Empire that his figure was represented in 1862 in the bronze monument of the Millennium of Russia in the Novgorod Kremlin. Bortniansky composed in many different musical styles, including choral compositions in French, Italian, Latin, German and Church Slavonic.  Biography  Student Dmitry Bortniansky was born on 28 October 1751 in the city of Glukhov,The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music Cossack Hetmanate, Russian Empire (in present-day Ukraine). His father was Stefan Skurat (or Shkurat), a Lemko-Rusyn Orthodox religious refugee from the village of Bartne in the Malopolska region of Poland. Stefan Skurat served as a Cossack under Kirill Razumovsky, he was entered in the Cossack register in 1755. Dmitry's mother was a Cossack origin woman, her surname after the first marriage was Marina Dmitrievna Tolstaya, she was a widow of a Russian landlord Tolstoy, who lived in Glukhov. At the age of seven, Dmitry's prodigious talent at the local church choir afforded him the opportunity to go the capital of the empire and sing with the Imperial Chapel Choir in St. Petersburg. Dmitry's half brother Ivan Tolstoy also sang with the Imperial Chapel Choir.Kovalev, Konstantin: Bortniansky. Moscow 1998. P. 34. There Dmitry Bortniansky studied music and composition under the director of the Imperial Chapel Choir, the Italian master Baldassare Galuppi. When Galuppi left for Italy in 1769, he took the boy with him. In Italy, Bortniansky gained considerable success composing operas: Creonte (1776) and Alcide (1778) in Venice, and Quinto Fabio (1779) at Modena. He also composed sacred works in Latin and German, both a cappella and with orchestral accompaniment (including an Ave Maria for two voices and orchestra). Master Bortniansky returned to the Saint Petersburg Court Capella in 1779 and flourished creatively. He composed at least four more operas (all in French, with libretti by Franz-Hermann Lafermi√®re): Le Faucon (1786), La f√™te du seigneur (1786), Don Carlos (1786), and Le fils-rival ou La moderne Stratonice (1787). Bortniansky wrote a number of instrumental works at this time, including piano sonatas and a piano quintet with harp, and a cycle of French songs. He also composed liturgical music for the Orthodox Church, combining the Eastern and Western European styles of sacred music, incorporating the polyphony he learned in Italy; some works were polychoral, using a style descended from the Venetian polychoral technique of the Gabrielis. After a while, Bortniansky's genius proved too great to ignore, and in 1796 he was appointed Director of the Imperial Chapel Choir, the first director not to have been imported from outside of the Russian Empire. With such a great instrument at his disposal, he produced scores upon scores of compositions, including over 100 religious works, sacred concertos (35 for four-part mixed choir, 10 for double choruses), cantatas, and hymns. Dmitry Bortniansky died in St. Petersburg on 10 October 1825, and was interred at the Smolensky Cemetery in St. Petersburg. His remains were transferred to the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the 20th century. Musical legacy In 1882, Pyotr Tchaikovsky edited the liturgical works of Bortniansky, which were published in ten volumes. While Bortniansky wrote operas and instrumental compositions, it is his sacred choral works that are performed most often today. This vast body of work remains central not only to understanding 18th- century Orthodox sacred music, but also served as inspiration to his fellow Ukrainian composers in the 19th century. The tune he wrote for the Latin hymn Tantum Ergo eventually became known in Slavic lands as –ö–æ–ª—å —Å–ª–∞–≤–µ–Ω (Kol slaven), in which form it is still sung as a church hymn today. The tune was also popular with freemasons. It travelled to English-speaking countries and came to be known by the names Russia, St. Petersburg or Wells. In Germany, the song was paired with a text by Gerhard Tersteegen, and became a well-known chorale and traditional part of the military ceremony Gro√üer Zapfenstreich (the Grand Tattoo), the highest ceremonial act of the German army, rendered as an honor for distinguished persons on special occasions. Prior to the October revolution in 1917, the tune was played by the Moscow Kremlin carillon every day at midday. James Blish, who novelized many episodes of the original series of Star Trek, noted in one story, Whom Gods Destroy, that Bortniansky's Ich bete an die Macht der Liebe was the theme \\"to which all Starfleet Academy classes marched to their graduation.\\" He composed \\"The Angel Greeted the Gracious One\\" (hymn to the Mother of God used at Pascha) as a trio used by many Orthodox churches in the Easter season.

Explanation The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true because \\"or\\" is defined inclusively rather than exclusively. It is a fallacy of equivocation between the operations OR and XOR. Affirming the disjunct should not be confused with the valid argument known as the disjunctive syllogism. Examples The following argument indicates the unsoundness of affirming a disjunct: :Max is a mammal or Max is a cat. :Max is a mammal. :Therefore, Max is not a cat. This inference is unsound because all cats, by definition, are mammals. A second example provides a first proposition that appears realistic and shows how an obviously flawed conclusion still arises under this fallacy. :To be on the cover of Vogue Magazine, one must be a celebrity or very beautiful. :This month's cover was a celebrity. :Therefore, this celebrity is not very beautiful.

He also served as Deputy Prime Minister of France from 1946 to 1947.  Pre- War  Thorez, born in Noyelles-Godault, Pas-de-Calais, became a coal miner at the age of 12. He joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1919 and was imprisoned several times for his political activism. After the 1920 split in the SFIO led to the formation of the French Communist Party (PCF), Thorez became party secretary in 1923 and, in 1930, secretary- general of the Party, a position he held until his death. In wake of his own struggle with Leon Trotsky, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin supported Thorez for PCF leadership following splits in many non-Soviet Communist parties. As the official leader, Thorez was secretly controlled by the Comintern and by the secretive Eugene Fried.Annie Kriegel, St√©phane Courtois: Eug√®ne Fried: Le grand secret du PCF, Seuil, 1997. . In 1932 Thorez became the companion of Jeannette Vermeersch; they had three sons before marrying in 1947, and remained married until his death. Thorez was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1932 and reelected in 1936. In 1934, following a Comintern directive, he helped form the Popular Front, an alliance between Communists, Socialists, and radical Socialists. In June 1934, at a party congress, Communist leader Maurice Thorez announced that ‚ÄúWe want, at whatever the cost, to accomplish unity in action with the socialist workers against fascism‚Ä¶ We want to bring over to us the middle class, wresting them from fascist demagoguery.‚Äù The working class‚Äôs interest now lies in ‚Äúnot underestimating the defense of democratic liberties.‚Äù And in what would be a key element of future policy, Thorez said, ‚ÄúWe love our country.‚Äù The Front, because of strong popular support as France was reeling from the impact of the Great Depression, won the elections of 1936. With the support of the Communists under Thorez, the socialist L√©on Blum became prime minister of a Popular Front government and managed to enact much of the Front's social-legislation programme. Meanwhile, Thorez presided over massive growth in the Communist Party, beginning with the elections of 1936.  World War II  Following the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939 and the subsequent Soviet participation in the invasion of Poland, the Communist Party was against the French war effort and so was outlawed: the Communist Party did not support what the Nazis stood for, but did support the Soviet Union's tactical treaty with Germany in order to direct German aggression away from the U.S.S.R. and toward Britain. Its publications were banned and many Party members were interned. Thorez himself had his nationality revoked. Shortly thereafter, Thorez was drafted, but rather than fight the Germans, he deserted from the army to flee to the Soviet Union. Thorez was tried in absentia for desertion and sentenced to death. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the French Communist Party openly declared it would violently resist the German occupation (though even before this the Communist Party organized a demonstration of thousands of students and workers against the occupation on 11 November 1940, and in May 1941 organized a strike of 100,000 miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments). During this time, articles written by and ghostwritten for Thorez appeared frequently in the party's underground newspaper, Humanit√© Clandestine. Each of these letters was signed 'Maurice Thorez, Somewhere in France.' It was not until several years after the war that the party admitted that this was false, and that Thorez had been in Moscow for the entire war. In his absence, the affairs of the Party and of the Party resistance movement (FTP) in France were organised by his second in command, Jacques Duclos. When General Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces liberated France in 1944, Thorez received a pardon. After the Liberation, Thorez was ordered by Stalin to lead the PCF immediately after the Second World War to a non-revolutionary road to power. The instructions were to have the reluctant wartime Communist partisans to surrender their weapons, while the party became a powerful force in the postwar governments since it was thought that they would soon win legally. Post-war In November 1944, he returned to France from the Soviet Union, and in 1945 his citizenship was restored. The PCF emerged from the Second World War as the largest political party in France based on its role in the anti-Nazi resistance movement during the occupation of France, at least after 1941. He tried to make a revolution, after strikes that he organised, in 1948 that failed only because the post-war army was strongly for the democratic Fourth Republic. Thorez was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies and reelected throughout the Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì1958).  In power  Forming a popular front with the Socialist Party in the 1945 elections, he became vice premier of France from 1946 to 1947. During this time, the Communist members of the coalition government supported the French drive to renew colonial rule in Indochina. See, George Moss, Vietnam: An American Ordeal, 3rd Edition 1998, Prentice-Hall; They were supported in this regard by Joseph Stalin. (ibid.) By 1947 a combination of the emerging Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union and growing social conflicts in France, linked to the increasing gap between wages and prices, put the three party union (SFIO, PCF and MRP) under heavy pressure. But the crisis came with the beginnings of the colonial war in Vietnam, with the communist deputies in the Assembl√©e nationale voting against the communist-participating government. That incident led Premier Paul Ramadier to dismiss his Communist ministers from the government on 7 May 1947. Contrary to a very common legend, the firing of the communist ministers was not linked to U.S. pressure, as a condition for France to benefit from the coming Marshall Plan. But the parallel movements in Italy and Belgium show that Cold War resistance to Communism was rising all over Western Europe at that time. The Communists' refusal to continue support for the French colonial effort in Vietnam on one hand and a wage-freeze during a period of hyperinflation on the other were the immediate triggers to the dismissal of Thorez and his colleagues from the ruling coalition in May 1947. In opposition  Although the Communists under Thorez's leadership continued to enjoy a dedicated following among a minority of the electorate, the French democratic parties operated to isolate and marginalize them for the remainder of the regime. Following the Cominform meeting in September 1947, Thorez abandoned its cooperative attitude towards the other political forces, intending to follow the Zhdanov Doctrine. He then proved to be the most Stalinist of all communist leaders in Western Europe, blocking the change of his party. That, and the growing popular distaste for the Party, clearly appeared after de Gaulle came to power again in 1958 upon the founding of the French Fifth Republic: the Communist Party's strength in the Chamber shrank to 10 seats. However, Thorez retained his seat. In 1950, at the height of his popularity among party members, Thorez suffered a stroke and remained in the Soviet Union for medical care until 1953. That March, Stalin died and Thorez was among the French delegation at Stalin's funeral. During his absence, the party was de facto controlled by his ally Jacques Duclos, who expelled Thorez's rival Andr√© Marty. Thorez resumed his duties upon returning to France. Although his health deteriorated, Thorez remained party leader, until shortly before his death in 1964 on a Black Sea cruise. He published Fils du peuple (1937; Son of the People, 1938) and Une politique de grandeur fran√ßaise (1945; \\"Politics of French Greatness\\"). The city of Torez in Ukraine was named after him in 1964. On 12 May 2016 the Ukrainian parliament renamed the town back to Chystyakove.

The third track was removed after a period of inactivity. Between 26 January 1942 and 6 February 1942, 14 trains were modified to become ambulance trains. The trains ferried returning wounded World War II servicemen from Melbourne to Heidelberg, where ambulances were waiting to collect them. Heidelberg's role in the war was recognised on 3 November 1995, 50 years after the end of the war, when Vin Heffernan, member for Ivanhoe, erected a plaque at the station to commemorate the event.Plaque inside Heidelberg Station During 1988, the former No. 4 and No. 5 tracks were abolished, along with a number of disc signal posts. In 1992, the station received an enclosed waiting area and ticket facilities, as part of the ‚ÄòTravel Safe‚Äô program of the early 1990s. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 21 June 1996. At 5am on 5 March 1994, after the signals were upgraded to an electronic system, one of the decommissioned mechanical semaphore signals (\\"Signal No. 4\\") was relocated from the Melbourne side of the station, to the car park opposite Platform 1, for display purposes.

It formed in 1990 at Akkerhaugen, Norway, under the name \\"Dark Device\\". Its style was mainly death metal, though it included some black metal traits, alongside Ihsahn's trademark keyboard melodies. The band split up in late 1991 when its members formed Emperor and Ildjarn. In 2000, Ihsahn used the name Thou Shalt Suffer for his solo project. That year he released Somnium, an album of ambient songs influenced by medieval music. History Thou Shalt Suffer began in 1990 when vocalist Ihsahn met guitarist Samoth at a clinic for rock musicians. The two started playing together under various names, such as Dark Device, Xerasia, and Embryonic. They eventually settled on Thou Shalt Suffer. It was during this time Ihsahn began to develop his skills as a keyboard player, and his trademark sound can be heard on the band's recordings. In 1991, the band recorded two demos, Into The Woods Of Belial and Open The Mysteries Of Your Creation. Both recordings exhibited a distinct style which would eventually develop into the classic \\"Emperor sound\\" of Ihsahn's and Samoth's later careers. Most of the band's early material was recorded on Ildjarn's 4-track recording device (which he later used to record his solo albums) and featured very raw and dirty production. When Samoth began writing music outside of the band, Thou Shalt Suffer began to dissolve. Bassist Ildjarn and drummer Thorbj√∏rn Akkerhaugen both left the band. Ildjarn formed his own eponymous project Ildjarn (which was often contributed to by both Ihsahn and Samoth), while Akkerhaugen went on to found Akkerhaugen Studios. At this point (late 1991), Emperor had come into full swing, and Thou Shalt Suffer was put on hold. Ihsahn didn't completely abandon the band, however ‚Äì instead, he used the name to release dark neo-romantic orchestral music. The first Thou Shalt Suffer full-length album was released in 2000, titled Somnium. It was composed and produced entirely by Ihsahn. The band's original two demos were pressed to CD and released to the public. This compilation, simply titled Into The Woods Of Belial was re-released and widely distributed in 2004. For the time being, Thou Shalt Suffer seems to be on hold once again, as Ihsahn is focusing primarily on his solo career because his previous project, Peccatum, has been terminated.

It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Greensborough opening on 5 June 1902.Greensborough Vicsig It was upgraded to a Premium station on 21 June 1996. Because of the curvature of the line, northbound (Hurstbridge) bound services head south-east upon departing the station, and, likewise, southbound (Flinders Street) bound services head north-west. Just past the station, the double track becomes single, for the remainder of the journey to Hurstbridge. A number of peak hour services to and from Flinders Street terminate at Greensborough. History Greensborough station was a single track, single platform train station built in 1902, for service to (at the time) the outer north eastern suburb of Greensborough. At the time of construction, it was serviced by steam engines inbound and outbound from the Melbourne central business district, until the completion of the electrification from Heidelberg to Eltham in 1923. The original platform was located on the south western side of the current platforms where current parking is available. The original track ran through the current island platform. Due to the restrictions of only having one track out to Hurstbridge and only one through track, the trains were timetabled to arrive 3‚Äì4 minutes apart. The Hurstbridge service would collect passengers from the platform, then shunt out to a junction at the Up end of the station, pull into a side track and wait 1‚Äì2 minutes for the Flinders Street service to arrive then depart, then continuing to Hurstbridge. Due to a much higher passenger count going to the city at the time, the Flinders Street service was given priority over the low passenger count toward Hurstbridge. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the station was upgraded to two tracks, and a single platform island was built. The station had a platform on the left and right, one for each direction. The rebuilt station officially opened on 3 April 1970. The goods yard that existed at the station was removed in the late 1970s. The timetabling for services, however, have remained practically the same, due to the single track which still remains between Greensborough and Hurstbridge, with only crossing loops at Eltham and Diamond Creek. An Eltham/Hurstbridge service arrives approximately one minute before the Flinders Street service arrives, with both services departing at same time, allowing the outbound service clear passage to Eltham. In May 2019, Victoria State Government announced the plan to duplicate section between this station and Eltham, which includes rebuilding this station.

A shaft is supported by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that no contact occurs. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure, which is generated by the rotation that pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. The high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting. Development alt= Sectional diagram of a foil bearing, showing the component parts (inner, moving outwards) of the shaft journal, a smooth top foil, the bump foil (both foils joined) and finally the bearing housing alt= Graph of load capacity against speed for first and third generation bearings: The load is proportional to rotation speed, bearing length, and the square of shaft diameter. Third-generation bearings carry about three times as much load as first-generation ones. Foil bearings were first developed in the late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the Garrett Corporation using independent R&D; funds to serve military and space applications. They were first tested for commercial use in United Airlines Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early and mid-1960s. Garrett AiResearch air cycle machine foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the DC-10's environmental control systems. Garrett AiResearch foil bearings were installed on all US military aircraft to replace existing oil-lubricated rolling-contact bearings. The ability to operate at cryogenic gas temperatures and at very high temperatures gave foil bearings many other potential applications. Current-generation foil bearings with advanced coatings have greatly exceeded the limitations of earlier designs. Antiwear coatings exist that allow over 100,000 start/stop cycles for typical applications. Applications Turbomachinery is the most common application because foil bearings operate at high speed. The main advantage of foil bearings is the elimination of the oil systems required by traditional bearing designs. Other advantages are: * Higher efficiency, due to a lower heat loss to friction; instead of fluid friction, the main source of heat is parasitic drag * Increased reliability * Higher speed capability * Quieter operation * Wider operating temperature range (40‚Äì2,500 K) * High vibration and shock load capacity * No scheduled maintenance * No external support system * Truly oil free where contamination is an issue * Capable of operating above critical speed Areas of current research are: * Higher load capacity * Improved damping * Improved coatings The main disadvantages are: * Lower capacity than roller or oil bearings * Wear during start-up and stopping * High speed required for operation See also * Fluid bearing * Tribology References External links *NASA Glenn Research Center \\"Creating a Turbomachinery Revolution\\" *NASA Tribology & Mechanical Components Branch *R&D; Dynamics Corporation Foil bearing supported high speed turbomachinery *Turbomachinery and Energy System Laboratory at UTA *Mohawk Innovative Technology, Inc. *Tribology Group at Texas A&M; *Korean Institute for Science and Technology KIST *Center for Rotating Machinery at LSU Bearings (mechanical) Gas turbine technology ","title":"Foil bearing"},{"id":"708582","text":"Thornbury railway station is located on the Mernda line, in Victoria, Australia.

Childhood, early career and education Born in Horsham, Victoria, Australia in 1925, the eldest child of Thomas Basil Hennessy and Nell Poultney, Hennessy was educated in nearby Ballarat, before leaving school at 17 to join the Royal Australian Navy. Released from military service in 1946, Hennessy enrolled at the University of Sydney in early 1947 with the intention of studying anthropology. In 1948, however, Arthur Dale Trendall and James Stewart founded the University's Department of Archaeology, Hennessy becoming one of their first undergraduates. Foreign ventures Graduating with a BA Hons in 1950, Hennessy embarked on a tour throughout the Middle East, finishing at Ankara, capital of Turkey where Hennessy held the inaugural student scholarship at the newly created British School of Archaeology in Ankara. Hennessy returned to Jerusalem at the end of 1951 in order to join the first season of renewed excavations at Jericho under the direction of Kathleen Kenyon. It was at Jericho that Hennessy was exposed to the Wheeler-Kenyon technique of baulk-debris excavation, a technique he was to employ and adapt widely in his own subsequent excavations. Returning to Australia via London, Hennessy became engaged to Ruth Shannon. The couple were married in 1954 and subsequently had three children. 1954 also saw Hennessy join the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sydney, initially as a temporary lecturer (1954‚Äì55, 1957), then later as a full-time lecturer (1958‚Äì61). 1962 saw Hennessy and his young family leave Australia once more, in order that Hennessy might pursue postgraduate study at Oxford University, England. During the period 1962-64, Hennessy studied at Magdalen College, completing his DPhil under the supervision of Kathleen Kenyon. His resulting dissertation, entitled The Foreign Relations of Palestine during the Early Bronze Age, remains one of the early standard works on that period. Years in Jerusalem Hennessy's completion of his doctorate coincided with the beginning of an intimate association with the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. Appointed Assistant Director of the School in 1965, becoming Deputy Director later the same year, Hennessy achieved the full directorship in 1966, remaining as Director until 1970. During these years, Hennessy directed excavations at the Damascus Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem (1964‚Äì66), at the Amman Airport Temple (1966), at Teleilat Ghassul (1967) and at Samaria in 1968. Return to Sydney Hennessy left Jerusalem in 1970 because of the outbreak of Arab- Israeli hostilities, taking up the Edwin Cuthbert Hall Visiting Professorship in Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney. The chair was fully restored in 1973, Hennessy holding the Sydney professorship from that year until his retirement in 1990, when he was replaced by the current chair, Daniel Potts. During his tenure, Hennessy directed Australian excavations at Teleilat Ghassul (1975‚Äì77) and, from 1978 at Pella (initially in association with Wooster College, Ohio). Hennessy was also instrumental in founding the Near Eastern Archaeology Foundation at the University of Sydney in 1986. Retirement and honours Hennessy was appointed Emeritus Professor of Archaeology after his retirement in 1990 and in 1993 received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from his alma mater, the University of Sydney.

It is the third-largest known impact crater or astrobleme on Earth, as well as one of the oldest. The crater formed 1.849 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. The basin is located on the Canadian Shield in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario. The former municipalities of Rayside-Balfour, Valley East and Capreol lie within the Sudbury Basin, which is referred to locally as \\"The Valley\\". The urban core of the former city of Sudbury lies on the southern outskirts of the basin. The Sudbury Basin is located near a number of other geological structures, including the Temagami Magnetic Anomaly, the Lake Wanapitei impact crater, the western end of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone and the eastern end of the Great Lakes Tectonic Zone, although none of the structures are directly related to each other in the sense of resulting from the same geological processes.  Formation  Onaping Fallback Breccia, polished slab, The Sudbury basin formed as a result of an impact into the Nuna supercontinent from a bolide approximately in diameter that occurred 1.849 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. Debris from the impact was scattered over an area of thrown more than ; rock fragments ejected by the impact have been found as far away as Minnesota.Associated Press: \\"Ontario crater debris found in Minn.\\", Star Tribune, July 15, 2007 Models suggest that for such a large impact, debris was most likely scattered globally,Melosh, J. (1989)Impact Cratering: A Geologic Process. Oxford University Press. but has since been eroded away. Its present size is believed to be a smaller portion of a round crater that the bolide originally created. Subsequent geological processes have deformed the crater into the current smaller oval shape. Sudbury Basin is the third-largest crater on Earth, after the Vredefort crater in South Africa, and the Chicxulub crater under Yucat√°n, Mexico.  Structure  The full extent of the Sudbury Basin is long, wide and deep, although the modern ground surface is much shallower. The main units characterizing the Sudbury Structure can be subdivided into three groups: the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC), the Whitewater Group, and footwall brecciated country rocks that include offset dikes and the Sub layer. The SIC is believed to be a stratified impact melt sheet composed from the base up of sub layer norite, mafic norite, felsic norite, quartz gabbro, and granophyre. The Whitewater Group consists of a suevite and sedimentary package composed of the Onaping (fallback breccias), Onwatin, and Chelmsford Formations in stratigraphic succession. Footwall rocks, associated with the impact event, consist of Sudbury Breccia (pseudotachylite), footwall breccia, radial and concentric quartz dioritic breccia dikes (polymict impact melt breccias), and the discontinuous sub layer. Because considerable erosion has occurred since the Sudbury event, an estimated in the North Range, it is difficult to directly constrain the actual size of the diameter of the original transient cavity, or the final rim diameter.Pye, E.G., Naldrett, A.J. & Giblin, P.E. (1984) The Geology and Ore Deposits of the Sudbury Structure. Ontario Geological Survey, Special Volume 1, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. The deformation of the Sudbury structure occurred in five main deformation events (by age in Mega years): # formation of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (1849 Ma) # Penokean orogeny (1890‚Äì1830 Ma) # Mazatzal orogeny (1700‚Äì1600 Ma) # Grenville orogeny (1400‚Äì1000 Ma) # Lake Wanapitei impact (37 Ma)  Disputes over origin  Geological map of the Copper Cliff area, produced in the 1950s. Some 1.8 billion years of weathering and deformation made it difficult to prove that a meteorite was the cause of the Sudbury geological structures. A further difficulty in proving that the Sudbury complex was formed by meteorite impact rather than by ordinary igneous processes was that the region was volcanically active at around the same time as the impact, and some weathered volcanic structures can look like meteorite collision structures. Since its discovery, a layer of breccia has been found associated with the impact event and stressed rock formations have been fully mapped. Geologists reached consensus by about 1970 that the Sudbury basin was formed by a meteorite impact. Reports published in the late 1960s described geological features that were said to be distinctive of meteorite impact, including shatter cones and shock-deformed quartz crystals in the underlying rock. In 2014, analysis of the concentration and distribution of siderophile elements as well as the size of the area where the impact melted the rock indicated that a comet rather than an asteroid most likely caused the crater.  Modern uses  Rich ore sample from Sudbury, collected in 1932: Pentlandite ‚Äì Chalcopyrite ‚Äì Pyrrhotite The large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold, and other metals. In 1856 while surveying a baseline westward from Lake Nipissing, provincial land surveyor Albert Salter located magnetic abnormalities in the area that were strongly suggestive of mineral deposits. The area was then examined by Alexander Murray of the Geological Survey of Canada, who confirmed \\"the presence of an immense mass of magnetic trap\\". Due to the then-remoteness of the Sudbury area, Salter's discovery did not have much immediate effect. The later construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the area, however, made mineral exploration more feasible. The development of a mining settlement occurred in 1883 after earth moving at the railway construction site revealed a large concentration of nickel and copper ore at what is now the Murray Mine site. As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world's major mining communities. The region is one of the world's largest suppliers of nickel and copper ores. Most of these mineral deposits are found on the outer rim of the basin. Due to the high mineral content of its soil, the floor of the basin is among the best agricultural land in Northern Ontario, with numerous vegetable, berry, and dairy farms located in the valley. However, because of its northern latitude, it is not as productive as agricultural lands in the southern portion of the province. Accordingly, the region primarily supplies products for consumption within Northern Ontario, and is not a major food exporter. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the discovery of the Sudbury Basin.  Astronaut training  NASA used the site to geologically train the Apollo astronauts in recognizing rocks formed as the result of a very large impact, such as breccias. Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 15's David Scott and James Irwin, Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke, and Apollo 17's Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt. Notable geologist instructors included William R. Muehlberger.

It is currently made in Waterford and County Kilkenny and was historically made in Wexford. Blaas are sold in two varieties: \\"soft\\" and \\"crusty\\". Soft blaas are slightly sweet, malt flavour, light but firm in texture and melt in the mouth. Crusty blaas are crunchy at first bite, then chewy with a subtle malt taste and a pleasing bitter aftertaste from the well cooked, dark crust. Eaten mainly at breakfast with butter, they are also eaten at other times of the day with a wide variety of fillings (including a type of luncheon meat often referred to as \\"red lead\\"). The breakfast blaa (egg, bacon rasher and sausage) is more common than the breakfast roll in Waterford. A combined 12,000 blaas are sold each day by the four remaining bakeries producing blaas: Walsh's Bakehouse, Kilmacow Bakery, Barron's Bakery & Coffee House and Hickey's Bakery. Of the four remaining bakeries, only two remain in Waterford City. Blaas quickly lose their freshness and are best consumed within a few hours of purchase. Some sources report that the blaa was introduced to Waterford at the end of the 17th century by the Huguenots. This theory is disputed because although white flour existed in the 17th century, it was not widely used until mass production of the industrial revolution. Blaas are sometimes confused with a similar bun known as a bap; however, blaas are square in shape, softer, and doughier, and are most notably identified by the white flour shaken over them before the baking process.\\"Blaa blaa blaa: Waterford bap considered for EU protected statuss\\", Thejournal.ie, 8 September 2011.

The main east to west route is now part of London Overground's North London Line. Other NLR lines fell into disuse but were later revived as part of the Docklands Light Railway, and London Overground's East London Line. The company was originally called the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway (E&WID;&BJR;) from its start in 1850, until 1853. in 1909 it entered into an agreement with the London and North Western Railway which introduced common management, and the NLR was taken over completely by the LNWR in 1922. The LNWR itself became part of the LMS from the start of 1923. The railways were nationalised in 1948 and most LMS lines, including the North London route, then came under the control of the London Midland Region of British Railways. History Railway map of London, 1899, from The Pocket Atlas and Guide to London The East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 26 August 1846. It was empowered to construct a railway from the district of Poplar and the docks to Camden Town in north London. The railway's headquarters and locomotive works were initially in Bow. At first, it ran trains from Bow Junction on the London and Blackwall Railway (L&BR;) to Islington, starting on 26 September 1850. The line was extended to Camden Town railway stationRenamed Camden Road on 25 September 1950 from 7 December 1850 and to Hampstead Road station (later renamed Primrose Hill) from 9 June 1851. Another extension via the L&BR; was opened on 1 January 1852, from Bow Junction to Poplar railway station, and from there to Blackwall and the East India Docks; a connection at Bow allowed trains to run to Fenchurch Street. This arrangement lasted until 1865, when an extension from Dalston Junction to Broad Street was opened; Broad Street became the main terminus, and the Poplar line became a branch. In 1858 the line was extended along the North and South Western Junction Railway (a joint enterprise by the LNWR, Midland Railway and the NLR) from Willesden Junction to a London and South Western Railway branch to Richmond. A bypass line from Camden to Willesden Junction via Gospel Oak and West Hampstead opened in 1860. Meanwhile, at the eastern end, a spur line connecting the NLR to Stratford from Victoria Park opened in 1854 but was not used by passenger services. The line between Camden Town and Dalston Junction was quadrupled in 1871. The LNWR took over the working of the railway under a common management arrangement on 1 February 1909.The National Archives, RAIL 529/32 ‚Äì NLR Board Minute No 6940 of 14 January 1909 The company still existed until 1922, with its own board of directors and shareholders, when it was absorbed by the LNWR. The last board meeting and last shareholders meeting were both held on 23 November 1922, the latter giving the shareholders' approval of amalgamation. The board minutes were signed by A Holland-Hibbert, the chairman, who added \\"Goodbye!\\". Beneath this was typed, \\"This was the last Board Meeting of the North London Railway Company, the Undertaking being absorbed under ‚ÄúThe London and North Western Railway (North London Railway and Dearne Valley Railway) Preliminary Absorption Scheme 1922‚Äù by the London and North Western Railway Company as from 1 January 1922.\\"The National Archives RAIL 529/34 NLR Board Meeting 22 November 1922 The LNWR, which half-owned Broad Street station, was responsible for electrification of the Broad Street to Richmond and Kew Bridge lines in 1916. The Kew Bridge service was withdrawn as a wartime economy measure in 1940, which proved to be permanent. The line from Dalston Junction to Poplar was heavily damaged during the Blitz of World War II. Passenger services from Broad Street to Poplar via Victoria Park and Bow were suspended on 15 April 1944 and officially closed on 14 May 1944. A substitute bus service was provided until 23 April 1945 but the service was finally withdrawn at the end of the war. Passenger services from Dalston Junction to Victoria Park Junction resumed from 12 May 1980 during the gradual run-down of the line from Dalston Junction to Broad Street, which finally closed on 30 June 1986. The line from Victoria Park Junction to Poplar Docks via Bow Junction closed on 3 October 1983. Present day Camden Road station is one of the few remaining examples of the NLR's yellow-brick, \\"Venetian\\" architectural style. It was designed by Edwin Henry Horne. In 1979 the line between Richmond and Dalston via Gospel Oak and the extension to Stratford was joined with the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway to form the North London Line. The line between Willesden Junction and Camden via Primrose Hill is now primarily used (in 2014) for empty coaching stock movements between the North London Line and Willesden Depot, freight trains and, during engineering work, diverted passenger services to and from the Watford DC Line. Primrose Hill station has been closed. Since 31 August 1987, Docklands Light Railway has followed the path of the North London Railway from Bow Church to Poplar. The northern section of the East Cross Route (A12) built in the late 1960s ran parallel to the rail line between Old Ford and Victoria Park stations, both of which were demolished for the road's construction. The East London Line Extension took over the abandoned stretch between Dalston Junction and Shoreditch from April 2010, incorporating it into the London Overground network. Stock Among the first locomotives bought by the railway from outside contractors were five 0-4-2ST saddle tanks. After that, all were constructed at Bow, London. * List of locomotives * LNWR electric units Workshop Bow railway works was built in 1853 and had a sizeable wagon repair shop. When the railway was merged into the LMS it was the smallest of 15 workshops. It repaired NLR locomotives and from 1927 those from the former London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR). In the 1930s the works developed and manufactured the Hudd automatic control system for the LTSR, which led to a British Rail (BR) team from the national headquarters setting up in Bow to develop BR's standard Automatic Warning System. The workshop was badly damaged during the blitz and the wagon workshop destroyed. In 1956 the workshop repaired diesel-electric locomotives for the motive power depot at Devons Road (the first to become all-diesel). After a while it was receiving locos in the morning and turning them round by the evening, which initially confused the statistical returns since locos were entering and leaving the works on the same day. The works closed in 1960. Stations Hoxton.

Gesenius, Hebrew Lexicon (Strong's H1935).) is the eighth sephira of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Hod sits below Gevurah and across from Netzach in the tree of life; Yesod is to the south-east of Hod. It has four paths, which lead to Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netzach, and Yesod. All the sephirot are likened to different parts of the body, and Netzach and Hod are likened to the two feet of a person i.e. the right and left foot. The feet are usually only the means for a person's activity. While the hands are the main instrument of action, the feet help bring a person to the place where he wishes to execute that action. Hasidic Judaism's view of Hod is that it is connected with Jewish prayer. Prayer is seen as form of \\"submission\\"; Hod is explained as an analogy - that instead of \\"conquering\\" an obstacle in one's way, (which is the idea of Netzach), subduing oneself to that \\"obstacle\\" is related to the quality of Hod. Hod is where form is given by language in its widest sense, being the key to the \\"mystery of form\\" (this may be an adoption of a point of view of Jacques Lacan). Our unconscious desires come from Netzach, and are given form in the symbolic realm by Hod, manifesting unconsciously through Yesod to Malkuth. \\"Hod is like doing your dirty laundry\\" -Reb Zalman Shachter-Shalomi Non-Jewish occult associations Hod is described as being a force that breaks down energy into different, distinguishable forms, and it is associated with intellectuality, learning and ritual, as opposed to Netzach, Victory, which is the power of energy to overcome all barriers and limitations, and is associated with emotion and passion, music and dancing. Both these forces find balance in Yesod, foundation, the world of the unconscious, where the different energies created await expression in the lowest world of Malkuth, the Kingdom. The archangel of this sphere is Michael, and the Bene Elohim is the Angelic order. The opposing demonic order in the Qliphoth is Samael, headed by the Archdemon Adrammelech. Hod is said to be the sphere in which the magician mostly works. An example is given by Dion Fortune in The Mystical Qabalah: Imagine primitive man is meditating in the wilderness, and comes in contact with, and begins to understand, some energy that surrounds him. So that he can grasp it better, he creates some form, perhaps the form of a god or a symbol, so he has something he can relate to. He then uses that statue or that symbol in future ceremonies to contact that intangible energy once again. This is the role that Hod plays in magic, while the music and dance that may be present in such a ceremony is the role that Netzach might play, providing the raw energy to reach the higher levels of consciousness. In comparison with Eastern systems, both Hod and Netzach are sometimes associated with the Manipura chakra, which is associated with the breaking down and releasing of energy, anabolism and catabolism. In 777, Aleister Crowley associates Hod to the Four Eights of occult tarot, Anubis, Thoth, Hanuman, Loki, Hermes, Mercury, Jackal. Hermaphrodite, Opal, Storax, and quicksilver (Not a complete list).

Biography After education at Canterbury Boys' High School (where he was a contemporary of former Liberal Australian prime minister John Howard), Windschuttle was a journalist on newspapers and magazines in Sydney. He completed a BA (first class honours in history) at the University of Sydney in 1969, and an MA (honours in politics) at Macquarie University in 1978. He enrolled as a PhD student but did not submit a thesis; instead he published it under the title The Media with Penguin Books. In 1973, he became a tutor in Australian history at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Between 1977 and 1981, Windschuttle was lecturer in Australian history and in journalism at the New South Wales Institute of Technology (now the University of Technology, Sydney) before returning to UNSW in 1983 as lecturer/senior lecturer in social policy. He resigned from UNSW in 1993 and founded Macleay Press, a small-press publishing company. Published authors besides Windschuttle include Leonie Kramer and Michael Connor. He has been a regular visiting and guest lecturer on history and historiography at American universities. In June 2006, he was appointed to the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Australia's non-commercial public broadcaster. Political evolution An adherent of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s, Windschuttle later moved to the right. This process is first evident in his 1984 book The Media, which took inspiration from the empirical perspective of the Marxist historian E. P. Thompson, especially his The Poverty of Theory, to make a highly critical review of the Marxist theories of Louis Althusser and Stuart Hall. While the first edition attacked \\"the political program of the New Right\\" and set out a case for both favouring \\"government restrictions and regulation\\" and condemning \\"private enterprise and free markets\\",Gerard Henderson, \\"The Battle is not to be Left Behind\\", The Age, 24 December 2002. the third edition four years later (1988) took a different view: > Overall, the major economic reforms of the last five years, the deregulation > of the finance sector, and the imposition of wage restraint through the > social contract of The Accord, have worked to expand employment and > internationalize the Australian economy in more positive ways than I thought > possible at the time. In The Killing of History, Windschuttle defended the practices and methods of traditional empirical history against postmodernism, and praised historians such as Henry Reynolds, but he now argues that some of those he praised for their empirically-grounded work fail to adhere to the principle. In the same book, Windschuttle maintains that historians on both sides of the political spectrum have misrepresented and distorted history to further their respective political causes or ideological positions. In The Fabrication of Aboriginal History and other writings on Australian Aboriginal history, Windschuttle criticises historians who, he claims, have extensively misrepresented and fabricated historical evidence to support a political agenda. He argues that Aboriginal rights, including land rights and the need for reparations for past abuses of Aboriginal people, have been adopted as a left-wing 'cause' and that those he perceives as left-wing historians distort the historical record to support that cause. For Windschuttle, the task of the historian is to provide readers with an empirical history as close to the objective truth as possible, based on an analysis of documentary, or preferably eye-witness, evidence. He questions the value of oral history. His \\"view is that Aboriginal oral history, when uncorroborated by original documents, is completely unreliable, just like the oral history of white people\\". A historian has no responsibility for the political implications of an objective, empirical history. One's political beliefs should not influence one's evaluation of archival evidence.Keith Windschuttle, 'Doctored Evidence and Invented Incidents in Aboriginal Historiography', in Bain Attwood and S. G. Foster (eds), Frontier Conflict: The Australian Experience, Canberra: National Museum of Australia, 2003, p. 106. For some of his critics, \\"historians don't just interpret the evidence: they compose stories about these meanings, or in the words of Hayden White, they 'emplot' the past. This is itself a cultural process\\".Stephen Garton, \\"On the Defensive: Poststructuralism and Australian Cultural History\\" in Hsu-Ming Teo, Richard White (eds.) Cultural history in Australia, UNSW Press, 2003 pp Windschuttle's recent research disputes the idea that the colonial settlers of Australia committed genocide against the Indigenous Australians. He also disputes the widespread view that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement.Keith Windschuttle, Postmodernism and the Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Lecture to NSW Higher School Certificate History Extension Conference, Tom Mann Theatre, Sydney, 30 May 2007. He writes: \\"There are two central claims made by historians of Aboriginal Australia: first, the actions by the colonists amounted to genocide; second, the actions by the Aborigines were guerilla tactics that amounted to frontier warfare.\\" He goes on to say: \\"Ryan says the so-called 'Black War' of Tasmania began in the winter of 1824 with the Big River tribe launching patriotic attacks on the invaders.\\" Extensive debate on his work has come to be called the history wars. He dismisses assertions, which he imputes to the current generation of academic historians, that there was any resemblance between racial attitudes in Australia and those of South Africa under apartheid and Germany under the Nazis. He has been a frequent contributor to conservative magazines, such as Quadrant in Australia, of which he became editor in 2007, and The New Criterion in the United States.

Windschuttle criticizes the last 3 decades of historical scholarship which had challenged the traditional view of Aboriginal passivity in the face of European colonisation.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia': A Review of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History: Volume One\\", in Journal of Social History, Vol. 37, No. 2 (Winter, 2003), pp. 493‚Äì505, p.493. His critique specifically challenges the prevailing consensus created by what he called the \\"orthodox school\\" of Australian frontier history concerning the violence between indigenous Australians and settlers, by examining the evidence for reported massacres in what is known as the \\"Black War\\" against the Aboriginal people of Tasmania. He refers to historians he defines as making up this \\"orthodox school\\" as being \\"vain\\" and \\"self-indulgent\\" for imposing their politics onto their scholarship,Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847, p. 402. and \\"arrogant, patronizing and lazy\\" for portraying the Tasmanian Aboriginal people's behavior and motivations in terms of European cultural concepts rather than taking the time to understand the cultural concepts of a hunter-gatherer society.Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847, p. 406. Windschuttle's \\"orthodox school\\" comprises a large number of historians and archaeologists, deceased or living, such as Henry Reynolds, Lyndall Ryan, Lloyd Robson, John Mulvaney, Rhys Jones, Brian Plomley, and Sharon Morgan, whom he regards as responsible for a politicized reading of the past, and for inflating the number of Aboriginal deaths.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia': A Review of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History\\", p. 495. Reviewing their work, he highlights multiple examples of misrepresented sources,e.g. a colonial government report being cited as evidence of a massacre by a vigilante group when the report refers only to the movement of troops in response to Aboriginal attacks: Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847 Macleay Press, 2002, p. 142. inaccurate reportageAn Anglican minister's diary reported as recording 100 Aboriginal and 20 white deaths, was found to record 4 for the former, and 2 for the latter. Checking a source for Brian Plomley's reference to \\"more killed\\", Windschuttle found that the original actually had \\"mare killed\\". ‚Äî Geoffrey Blainey, \\"Native Fiction\\", The New Criterion, Vol. 21, 2003, p. 79. or the citation of sources that do not exist.The Hobart Town Courier for 1826 is twice cited by one historian as providing the evidence for killings, but was not printed that year. ‚Äî Geoffrey Blainey, \\"Native Fiction\\", The New Criterion, Vol. 21, 2003, p. 79. His work on sources constitutes, according one critic, his most damaging contribution to the subject, though Stuart Macintyre argues that Windschuttle \\"misreads those whom he castigates\\". Windschuttle challenges the idea that mass killings were commonplace, arguing that the colonial settlers of Australia did not commit widespread massacres against Indigenous Australians; he drastically reduces the figures for the Tasmanian Aboriginal death toll, and writes that Aboriginal people referred to by both Reynolds and Ryan as resistance figures, included \\"black bushrangers\\" and others engaged in acts normally regarded as \\"criminality\\"; arguing that the evidence clearly shows that attacks by Aboriginal people on settlers were almost invariably directed at acquiring goods, such as flour, sugar, tea and tobacco, and that claims by orthodox historians that this was a form of guerrilla warfare against British settlement aren't supported by credible evidence.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 65‚Äì77, 95‚Äì103.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia',\\" p. 497. Vicki Grieves argues that Windschuttle regards Aboriginal men who traded their women's services as pimps, although Windschuttle does not use the term. Adducing the work of a source who Stuart Macintyre claims is 'a particularly tendentious American anthropologist',His source is Robert B. Edgerton, Sick Societies: Challenging the Myth of Primitive Harmony, Free Press, New York, 1992 pp. 47ff. he argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal society was primitive, dysfunctional and on the verge of collapse, because their putative maltreatment of women impaired their ability to reproduce in a number of critical ways. Windschuttle agrees with earlier historical analysis, such as that of Geoffrey Blainey, that introduced disease was the primary cause of the demise of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 372‚Äì375. He is highly critical of recent historical scholarship, arguing that much of it ignores the scholar's basic duties to be objective and true to the evidence, and he advances a sympathetic analysis of settler opinion, arguing that historians such as Henry Reynolds had misrepresented the contents of records of settler opinion to conceal the fact that the majority of settlers were consistently in favour of the protection of Aboriginal people.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, , pp. 308‚Äì314. He also criticises Aboriginal land right politics,Gregory D. B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia',\\" p. 494, 497. arguing that it has resulted in many Aboriginal people being effectively confined to remote settlements far from viable employment opportunities and from the benefits of a modern society.http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol15/v15chap11.pdf His own examination of archives, contemporary newspapers, diaries and official accounts yields a provisory figureK. Windschuttle, \\"This figure is not absolute or final\\". of approximately 120 deaths of Tasmanian Aboriginal people \\"for which there is a plausible record of some kind\\" as having been killed by settlers, as opposed to earlier figures ranging as high as 700,Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia',\\" p. 494. and thus far less than the number of whites (187) reported as killed during the \\"Black War\\" of 1824 to 1828 by Aboriginal people.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 387‚Äì397. Windschuttle argues that the principles of the Enlightenment, fused with the 19th century evangelical revival within the Church of England and Britain's rule of law had a profound effect on colonial policy and behaviour, which was humane and just,Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia',\\" p. 496. that together made the claimed genocide culturally impossible. Gregory D.B. Smithers argues that Windschuttle interpreted settler violence as self-defence. Windschuttle argues that encroaching pastoralism did not cause starvation through the loss of native hunting grounds as some historians have proposed, as their numbers were being drastically reduced by introduced disease,Geoffrey Blainey, \\"Native Fiction\\", The New Criterion, April 2003. and large parts of Tasmania were not then, or now, occupied by white settlers.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 87‚Äì95. Windschuttle's estimate of the size of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population at the time of settlement is that it may have been as low as 2,000. Estimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are generally in the range of 3,000 to 8,000 people. Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures, which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were \\"more numerous than the white people were aware of\\" but that their population had been decimated by a sudden outbreak of disease prior to 1803.James Bonwick, Daily Life and Origins of the Tasmanians, Sampson, Low, Son and Marston, London, 1870, p. 84-85. It has been speculated that early contacts with passing ships, exploratory expeditions or sealers before colonization may have caused outbreaks of epidemic disease.Josephine Flood, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006, pp. 66‚Äì67. The low rate of genetic drift found in a recent genetic study argues that the highest previous estimate of pre- colonial Aboriginal population (8,000) is likely too low and that a significantly higher population cannot be ruled out. He argues that the evidence shows that what the orthodox historians construed as \\"resistance\\" by Tasmanian Aboriginal people were acts of theft and violence motivated by their desire for exotic consumer goods like flour, tea, sugar and blankets. The indigenous culture, in his view, \\"had no sanctions against the murder of anyone outside their immediate clan\\", therefore they had no cultural sanctions preventing the killing of settler outsiders to obtain desired goods or in revenge. The forced removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people from the Tasmanian mainland to Flinders Island was the Colonial Administration's measure to ensure peace for hard-pressed settlers while attempting, unsuccessfully to prevent the extinction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people. The rapid decline in the Aboriginal population after the British colonisation was the product of the interaction of a number of factors, including introduced diseases causing death and infertility, continued internecine warfare, deaths through conflict with settlers and the loss of a significant number of women of childbearing age from the full-blooded aboriginal gene pool to white sealers and settlers through abduction, \\"trade\\" and by voluntary association. Specific issues =Treatment of women= Windschuttle refers to accounts by the French zoologist Fran√ßois P√©ron (who is credited with the first use of the term anthropology),Flannery, T. F. (1994) The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People, Chatswood: New South Wales Edward Duyker, Fran√ßois P√©ron: an Impetuous Life: Naturalist and Voyager, Miegunyah Press, 2006, describes him as the expedition's assistant zoologist. by George Augustus Robinson in his journals, and by the early Australian writer James Bonwick, of the violence and cruelty with which many Tasmanian Aboriginal men were observed to treat women. He notes that the \\"murder of women because of insult, jealousy and infidelity, was common\\" and that a woman who refused a particular suitor would often be abducted and raped. He argues that this contributed to the willingness of some Aboriginal women to associate themselves with sealers and settlers rather than their own people, so reducing the full-blooded Aboriginal population's ability to reproduce itself. He cites a number of accounts including one published in 1820 by a British officer who had spoken with Aboriginal women living with Bass Strait sealers. The officer reported that Aboriginal women made it known that their (Aboriginal) husbands treat them with \\"considerable harshness and tyranny\\" and that they sometimes run away and \\"attach themselves to the English sailors\\", finding \\"their situation greatly improved by attaching themselves to the sealing gangs\\".Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 379‚Äì382. Windschuttle holds that the willingness of some Tasmanian Aboriginal women to engage in prostitution with convicts, sealers and settlers and the Tasmanian Aboriginal men who \\"actively colluded\\" in the trade in their women aided in the transmission of venereal and other introduced diseases to the indigenous population. Windschuttle argues that introduced disease was the primary cause of the destruction of the full- blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people, not merely by directly causing deaths but also through widespread infertility resulting from introduced venereal disease.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 372‚Äì375, 383‚Äì386. James Boyce, a Tasmanian historian, dismisses Windschuttle's argument as \\"uninformed slander\\" based on a failure to read the only documentary sources that matter, the journals of French and British explorers recording the first contacts with Tasmanian Aboriginal people before the colonial period. Examining Windschuttle's use of sources for the view women were treated like slaves and drudges, he says Windschuttle relies on a selective reading of just two of many sources in an early work by Ling Roth, \\"written at the height of Social Darwinist orthodoxy\\" (1899). However, Ling Roth did not \\"write\\" these sources; he simply translated the diaries of the first contacts by the French explorers. One is from P√©ron, who noted scars on women, and interpreted them as signs of domestic violence, which however he had never witnessed. Other early observers took this scarring as an indigenous cultural practice. James Cook had noticed Aboriginal men and women's bodies were both incised with scars in the same manner. P√©ron was less sympathetic than other first observers on the Baudin expedition to Australia. Boyce argues that their observations, including those of the captain Nicolas Baudin, do not support Windschuttle's claims. Even P√©ron records an encounter at Port Cygnet with an Aboriginal group of men and women, who shared a meal of abalone with the French explorers and, according to P√©ron, provided \\"the most striking example we had ever had of attention and reasoning among savage people\\". P√©ron would have disagreed, Boyce believes, with Windschuttle's claim that \\"(t)raditional Aboriginal society placed no constraints on the women's sexual behaviour with men\\", for he was repeatedly rebuffed when he tried to make physical contact with Aboriginal women. Baudin believed that no one on his ship had managed to have sexual relations with the women on Bruny Island. The behaviour adduced by Windschuttle from the other, late report by J. E. Calder (in 1829) is, for Boyce, \\"self evidently a product of the extensive disruption of traditional life that had occurred by then\\". He concludes: \\"Only someone who is totally blind to the impact of changing power relations, of declining choices, of the profound impact of cultural disintegration and recurring violence and abuse, let alone the simple imperatives of survival, could cite the unfolding tragedy at Bruny Island in this period as evidence for the sexual mores and domestic relations of pre-invasion Aboriginal society\\".Boyce, in Robert Manne (ed.) Whitewash, pp. 65‚Äì66. Shayne Breen argues that Windschuttle's claim is a calculated guess. The picture is however complex. Evidence exists for some use of women as trading commodities. Some women were abducted by sealers, while others were traded by Aboriginal men in attempts to establish reciprocal relations with the sealers.Shayne Breen, \\"Tasmanian Aborigines\\", in James Jupp (ed.) The Australian People: an Encyclopedia of the Nation, its People and their Origins, Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 110‚Äì113. Shayne concludes that: \\"There is some evidence that Aboriginal men, especially along the northern and south eastern coastlines, used women as trading commodities. Some of this trading was culturally sanctioned, some of it was not. Sometimes women willingly participated, sometimes they did not. But no credible documentary evidence is available for widespread selling of women into prostitution. There is, however, strong evidence that the abduction of women by colonists was practised across the island for much of the period to 1820. Indeed, the 1830 Aborigines Committee found that the abduction of women was a major cause of attacks against colonists by Aborigines\\".Shayne Breen, \\"Criminals and Pimps: Keith Windschuttle and Tasmanian Aborigines\\", Evatt Foundation, 27 August 2003. In reply to Boyce, Windschuttle argues that Boyce could not have read the whole book, or even properly checked the index, which cited \\"this very evidence\\", i.e. the journals of early French and British explorers. With respect to Boyce's claims that Windschuttle was \\"unaware\\" of or \\"ignored\\" various sources, Windschuttle responded that Boyce's claims, based on what was, and was not, in Fabrications bibliography, misinterpret the purpose of a bibliography. It listed only the sources referred to in the text and in his footnotes, and was not intended as an exhaustive list of every book or document that he had read regarding colonial Tasmania. Windschuttle argues that \\"were Boyce more familiar with the ethnographic literature\\", he would know the most telling evidence about the treatment of women comes not from explorers but the Aboriginal people themselves; from the recorded words of Aboriginal men, such as Woorrady, Montpeliatter, Mannalargenna and Nappelarteyer, and those of Aboriginal women such as Tencotemainner, Truganini and Walyer. Windschuttle did not claim that women had been sold \\"into prostitution\\"Bass Strait sealers acquired Aboriginal women, and much more rarely Aboriginal men, for their skill in hunting seals, sea-birds and other foods, Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006, pp 58‚Äì60, 76 but that they were, as Breen admits, traded as commodities. Breen, Windschuttle replies, admits such trading and regards this as an admission of the \\"cruelty of pre-contact indigenous culture\\". For Windschuttle, Breen and others can say things that sicken no one, because they contextualise it within a model of British invasion and Aboriginal resistance, whereas he is taken to task for being \\"pitiless\\" for making what he argues is the same point, \\"within a historical model of aboriginal accommodation to a comparatively nonviolent British settlement\\".Keith Windschuttle, \\"No Slander in Exposing Cultural Brutality\\", The Australian, 29 December 2003. =Attachment to land= In reply to his critics, Windschuttle argues that Henry Reynolds \\"willfully misinterprets\\" what he wrote, since his argument about Aboriginal concepts of land is based not on their words but on their deeds. \\"It is not primarily an argument about Aboriginal language but about Aboriginal behaviour. I demonstrated the Tasmanian Aborigines did not act as if they demanded the exclusive usage of land. They had no concept of trespass\\". Windschuttle argues that no word list records an Aboriginal term corresponding to the English word \\"land\\" in the sense that Europeans use it, \\"as a two-dimensional space marked out with definite boundaries, which can be owned by individuals or groups, which can be inherited, which is preserved for the exclusive use of its owner, and which carries sanctions against trespassers\\", but states that \\"they certainly did identify themselves with and regularly hunted and foraged on particular territories, known as their \\"country\\", which I openly acknowledge. They had obvious attachments to these territories. But they did not confine themselves to these regions nor did they deter other Aborigines from entering their own territory\\". \\"Members of the Big River tribe, for instance, annually visited Cape Grim in the north-west, Port Sorell on the north coast, Oyster Bay on the east coast, and Pittwater and Storm Bay in the south-east; that is, they regularly traversed most of the island\\". \\"The strongest evidence for this thesis is actually the history of white colonization and the timing of the conflict that did occur between blacks and whites. Most observers at the time agreed there was very little violence in Tasmania for the first twenty years after the British arrived. And the historians, except Lyndall Ryan, agree there were minimal hostilities before 1824. If the Aborigines had really felt the land was exclusively theirs, they would not have waited more than twenty years after the colonists arrived to do something about it\\". He contrasts this to the fiercely territorial Polynesian tribes of New Zealand, Tahiti and Tonga who fought off the British immediately. \\"The fact that the Tasmanian Aborigines did not respond in the same way is not to say they didn't love their country or were thereby deficient as human beings. They simply had a different culture\\". The University of New England's Russell McDougall, in turn, has recently argued that Windschuttle's use of Henry Ling Roth's word- lists to deny an indigenous Tasmanian concept of \\"land\\" constitutes \\"a wrong- headed attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Aboriginal land claims\\", especially since Roth's lists made no claim to capture a linguistic totality, and Roth himself cited earlier testimonials to the fact that, though nomadic, the \\"Tasmanians confined themselves within the boundaries of specific territories\\". It was, McDougall argues, the pressing presence of colonisers that forced them to trespass and make war upon each other.Russell McDougall, \\"Henry Ling Roth in Tasmania\\", in Peter Hulme, Russell McDougall (eds.) Writing, Travel, and Empire: in the Margins of Anthropology, I.B. Tauris, 2007, pp. 43‚Äì68, p.61. Critical reception The appearance of the first volume provoked a lively polemical correspondence in the pages of The Australian, with its \\"agenda-setting capacity\\".R. Manne (ed.)Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Introduction p.10. It was positively reviewed by Geoffrey Blainey, who called it \\"one of the most important and devastating (books) written on Australian history in recent decades\\", although Blainey notes that not every side-argument in the book convinced him and that his \\"view is that the original Tasmanians were not as backward, mentally and culturally, as Windschuttle sometimes depicts them\\". On Windschuttle's analysis of the \\"fabrications\\", Blainey wrote: \\"While reading the long recital of these failings, I felt an initial sympathy towards the Australian and overseas historians who were under such intense scrutiny. But many of their errors, made on crucial matters, beggared belief. Moreover their exaggeration, gullibility, and what this book calls \\"fabrication\\" went on and on. Admittedly, if sometimes the historians' errors had chanced to favour the Aborigines, and sometimes they had happened to favour British settlers, a reader might sympathetically conclude that there was no bias amongst the historians but simply an infectious dose of inaccuracy. Most of the inaccuracies, however, are used to bolster the case for the deliberate destruction of the Aborigines.\\"Geoffrey Blainey, \\"Native Fiction\\", The New Criterion, April 2003: \\"his book will ultimately be recognized as one of the most important and devastating written on Australian history in recent decades\\". Claudio Veliz greeted it as \\"one of the most important books of our time\\".Manne, \\"Windschuttle's Whitewash\\", in Peter Craven (ed.), The Best Australian Essays, Black, Inc., 2003, pp. 65‚Äì77, p.66. Peter Coleman, while speaking of its \\"painstaking and devastating scholarship\\", regretted the absence from Windschuttle's work of any \\"sense of tragedy\\".Robert Manne, in R. Manne (ed.) Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Introduction, Black, Inc., 2003, pp. 9‚Äì10. Within a year Windschuttle's claims and research produced a volume of rebuttal, namely Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, an anthology edited and introduced by Robert Manne, professor of politics at La Trobe University, with contributions by Australian academics from a range of disciplines. Manne, who called Windschuttle's publication \\"one of the most implausible, ignorant and pitiless books about Australian history written for many years\\",Manne, \\"Windschuttle's Whitewash\\", in Craven, p. 66 summed up the case against Windschuttle's book, noting that its assessment of Aboriginal deaths is based on Plomley, despite the fact that Plomley denied that any estimate regarding such deaths could be made from the documentary record. Manne added further observations, to the effect: that \\"a scrupulous conservative scholar\\", H. A. Willis, using exactly the same sources as Windschuttle, instead came up with a figure of 188 violent deaths and another 145 rumoured deaths; that Windschuttle's method excludes deaths of Aborigines who were wounded, and later died; that all surviving Aborigines transported by Robinson to Flinders' Island bore marks of violence and gunshot wounds \\"perpetrated on them by depraved whites\\"; that Windschuttle cannot deny that between 1803 and 1834 almost all Tasmanian Aborigines died, and the only evidence for disease as a factor before 1829 rests on a single conversation recorded by James Bonwick, and that Aboriginal women who lived with sealers did not, however, die off from contact with bearers of foreign disease; that Windschuttle likened Aboriginal attacks on British settlers to \\"modern-day junkies raiding service stations for money\\", whereas both colonial records and modern historians speak of them as highly \\"patriotic\\", attached to their lands, and engaged in a veritable war to defend it from settlement; that by Windschuttle's own figures, the violent death rate of Aborigines in Tasmania in the 1820s must have been 360 times the murder rate in contemporary New York; that Windschuttle shows scarce familiarity with period books, citing only 3 of the 30 books published on Van Diemen's land for the period 1803‚Äì1834, and with one of them confuses the date of the first visit by the French with the publication date of the volume that recounted their expedition; that it is nonsensical to argue that a people who had wandered over an island and survived for 34,000 years had no attachment to their land; that Windschuttle finds no native words in 19th century wordlists for \\"land\\" to attest to such an attachment, when modern wordlists show 23 entries under \\"country\\".Robert Manne, \\"Windschuttle's Whitewash\\", in Peter Craven (ed.), The Best Australian Essays, Black, Inc., 2003, pp. 65‚Äì77.Also see Robert Manne, \\"Keith Windschuttle,\\" The Monthly, January 2010; Keith Windschuttle, \\"Mind Your Language, Robert,\\" Quadrant, May 2010; Windschuttle, \\"Robert Manne's Bad Language,\\" Quadrant, April 2010. This in turn provoked Melbourne writer and Objectivist John Dawson,John Dawson, \\"Historian Keith Windschuttle: Bringing Objectivity Back to the 'Queen of the Humanities',\\" Capitalism Magazine, 25 January 2003. to undertake a counter-rebuttal, Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History in which he argues that Whitewash leaves Windschuttle's claims and research unrefuted.John Izzard, \\"Keeping Track of the Fabrications,\\" Quadrant, Vol. LIV, No. 11, 2010. In their reviews, Australian specialists in both Aboriginal and indigenous peoples' history were generally far less impressed than those who praised the book, which included Geoffrey Blainey, Claudio Veliz and Peter Coleman. *Henry Reynolds interprets his book as an attempt to revive the concept of terra nullius, and regards it as \\"without doubt, the most biased and cantankerous historical work to appear since the publication of G.W. Rusden's three-volume History of Australia in the 1880s\\".Henry Reynolds, \\"Killing off the Case for Terra Nullius,\\" The Age, 23 August 2003. *The historian of genocide, Ben Kiernan, who classifies the fate of Aborigines as an example of the practice, situates Windschuttle's polemical history within a new campaign, led by Quadrant, but taken up by a \\"chorus of right-wing columnists\\" within the Australian mass media with a record of antagonism to both Aborigines and their \\"leftist\\" supporters.Ben Kiernan, \\"Cover-up and Denial of Genocide: Australia, the USA, East Timor, and the Aborigines\\", in Critical Asian Studies, Routledge, 34:2 (2002), pp. 163‚Äì192, p.182. *Stephen Garton, Professor of History, Provost & Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Sydney University, argued that \\"the flaw in Windschuttle's argument is his belief that history can only be based on the evidence that survives. Evidence is always partial and only takes on a meaning if placed in an appropriate context. In other words historians always construct larger worlds from the fragments that survive\\".Stephen Garton, \\"On the Defensive: Poststructuralism and Australian Cultural History\\", in Hsu-Ming Teo, Richard White (eds.), Cultural History in Australia, UNSW Press, 2003, pp. 52‚Äì67, p.61, p.62. *The University of Aberdeen's Gregory D. B. Smithers, an Australian comparativist working on native histories, argues that Windschuttle's political agenda shows a \\"discomfort with the way the 'orthodox school', by inflating Aboriginal deaths, impugns Australian identity and its virtuous Anglo-Saxon origins\\". Windschuttle's book plays to \\"the white wing populism of white Australians, who feel their racially privileged position is under attack\\". By reaction, Smithers argues, Windschuttle highlights \\"the nation's virtues\\", privileging the opinions of settlers and colonial officials, \\"while rejecting Aboriginal oral histories\\". Smithers argues that Windschuttle ignores documentary evidence that contradicts his own ideology, and fails to perceive that the island reserves created for indigenous Tasmanians were \\"racialized spaces\\" for a people regarded as a form of \\"social pollution\\"\\". He argues that the book is \\"a therapeutic history for white (Anglo-Saxon) Australians that distorts and distracts\\" and that in denying the reliability of historical evidence of racialized groups, Windschuttle employs a tactic used by historians to discredit historical accounts that do not fit with their presentist morality.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \\"Reassuring 'White Australia': A Review of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History: Volume One\\", in Journal of Social History, Vol. 37, No. 2 (Winter, 2003), pp. 493‚Äì505, pp.495‚Äì6, 500, 503 n.33. *For Stuart Macintyre, Windschuttle's book was not \\"so much counter-history as an exercise in incomprehension\\". He finds Windschuttle's method of calculating Aboriginal losses flimsy, and the figures he allocates to each incident \\"no more reliable than those, which he dismissed as guesswork, of mainstream frontier historians\\". He concludes that the first volume is \\"a shocking book, shocking in its allegation of fabrication and also in its refusal of the interpretive framework that earlier historians employed, and that its author \\"fails to register the tragedy of what was a fatal encounter\\". When challenged on his lack of compassion, Windschuttle is reported as replying: \\"You can't really be serious about feeling sympathy for someone who died 200 years ago\\". For Macintyre, \\"It is the absence of any sense of this tragedy, the complete lack of compassion for its victims, that is surely the most disturbing quality of Windschuttle's rewriting of Aboriginal history\\". *For University of Sydney historian Vicki Grieves, Windschuttle's approach reads as though indigenous people \\"were not the intentional targets of the colonisers but accidental targets, mostly through their inability to be realistic, objective, logical and moral, and thus the \\"seeds of their own destruction\\" lay within their own \\"psyche and culture\\". Even were one to concede Windschuttle's guesstimate for the pre-white population of Tasmania, by his own figures, the death-rate for his plausible deaths still works out as higher in percentage terms than the mortality risk of the Australian population during WWI, when 60,000 soldiers died. Windschuttle shows, she argues, a predilection for old colonial explanations, and Darwinist values, as though nothing had happened in between. Regarding native treatment of women, who in his account were viciously brutalized, Windschuttle appeals to the reader's moral outrage at the way a 14-year-old native girl was traded. In doing so, he ignores the fact that the age of consent in Britain at that time was 12, and whites themselves on the frontier exchanged wives or traded them for tobacco and rum. *James Boyce, in an extended review, notes that Windschuttle ignores native views for the period after 1832, precisely the date when almost all of what is known of Aboriginal perspectives began to be recorded. Examining Windschuttle's use of sources, he finds his selection of material narrow, and his reading of their contents \\"selective\\".James Boyce, \\"Fantasy Island\\", in R. Manne (ed.) Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 17‚Äì78, esp. p. 74, n. 107:, p. 77., n.179. *Bain Attwood of the School of Philosophical, Historical and International Studies at Monash University dismisses him as a \\"tabloid historian\\".Bain Attwood, \\"Old news from a Tabloid Historian\\", The Australian, 6 January 2003, p.13. However, Attwood concedes that \\"Boyce is unable to demonstrate\\" that the documents he says Windschuttle ignored \\"would have provided factual killings of Aborigines\\",Bain Attwood, Telling the Truth about Aboriginal History, Allen & Unwin, 2005, p. 251. and that revisionist' critics have demonstrated that the academic historians lacked documentation for most of the killings represented in their accounts\\".Bain, Telling the Truth about Aboriginal History, p. 162. *Shayne Breen, lecturer in Aboriginal history at the University of Tasmania, reads the book as \\"systematic character assassination\\", replete with \\"unsupportable generalizations\\", and nurtured by a \\"delusion\\" that only Windschuttle can find the historical truth. For Breen, \\"In making \\"the most primitive ever\\" claim, Windschuttle is not practising forensic scholarship. He is renovating a colonial ideology that decreed that Tasmanian Aborigines were the missing link between apes and man. This idea formed a central plank of what is known to scholars as scientific racism\\".Shayne Breen, \\"Criminals and Pimps: Keith Windschuttle and Tasmanian Aborigines\\", Evatt Foundation, 27 August 2003. Windschuttle's responses and critical replies In response to his critics, Windschuttle comments that they are \\"selective\\" in their critique, \\"politicised\\" in their judgment and do not address the \\"major charges\\" against the historians whom he criticised in Fabrication. Windschuttle wrote: > Robert Manne's anthology Whitewash does not address the empirical evidence > for genocide. In her essay in this collection, Lyndall Ryan does not attempt > to uphold her original claim. Nor does Henry Reynolds defend his version of > the topic[...] Yet this is supposed to be the place in which he and Ryan > answer my major charges against them. This is very telling. I take their > complete silence on this issue as an admission that their earlier claims are > unsustainable. He goes on to say: > Contrary to Manne's assertions, this death toll is not \\"almost entirely > reliant\\" on Brian Plomley's earlier survey of a similar kind. As Fabrication > states clearly, I \\"started with\\" Plomley's survey by checking his sources, > but then did my own research, which included a complete reading of all the > relevant files in the Tasmanian archives plus all the local newspapers up to > 1832, as well as all the contemporary diaries and journals I could find. In addressing some of his critics' claims, he wrote: > Vicki Greaves had read at least some of the book but apparently not very > much of it.

In the wake of the 2011 Norway attacks, Windschuttle did not deny that the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, had read and praised statements he had made at a symposium in New Zealand in 2006,Keith Windschuttle, The Sydney Line, 2006. but stressed that he was \\"still at a complete loss to find any connection between them and the disgusting and cowardly actions of Breivik\\". Windschuttle went on to add that \\"it would be a 'disturbing accusation' if people thought that he had ever used deliberately provocative language that might have caused Breivik to take up a rifle and shoot unarmed teenagers in cold blood\\".Laura Westbrook, \\"Mass killer Anders Behring Breivik's NZ link,\\" Stuff, 2011. The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume Three, The Stolen Generations 1881‚Äì2008 Published in 2009, the argument of this book is that the Stolen Generations is a myth.Roger Sandall, \\"Aboriginal Sin?,\\" The New Criterion, Vol. 28, 2010, p. 75. Key elements of the story of the Stolen Generations are that children of Aboriginal descent were forcibly removed from their families and their culture. It is alleged that the children were removed as young as possible so that they could be raised to be ignorant of their culture and people and that the ultimate intent was to end the existence of the Aborigines as a distinct people. It was also alleged that, as a part of this policy, parents were deliberately prevented from maintaining contact with their children. Windschuttle cites the words of the principal historian of the Stolen Generations, Peter Read: \\"Welfare officers, removing children solely because they were Aboriginal, intended and arranged that they should lose their Aboriginality, and that they never return home\\". Windschuttle argues that his analysis of the records shows that Aboriginal children \\"were never removed from their families in order to put an end to Aboriginality or, indeed, to serve any improper government policy or program\\". He found a similar level of misrepresentation and fabrication in the history of the alleged Stolen Generations as he had in his previous study on Van Diemen's Land. He argues that \\"until the term stolen generations first appeared in 1981, there had been no popular tradition among Aboriginal people that employed either the term or the concept\\". Indeed, one of the organisations now accused of participation in the removals had Aboriginal rights activists working as members of the board and yet apparently they did not notice that they were \\"stealing\\" children. In 1981, a \\"then unknown white postgraduate history student, Peter Read\\" wrote, \\"in the course of just one day\\", a twenty- page pamphlet to make the case. \\"He alone was granted the vision denied to all who came before him\\". Two years later, Coral Edwards, a colleague of Peter Read at the Link-Up social work organisation, made a speech to a meeting of the National Aboriginal Consultative Council to seek funds for Link-Up and referred to the claims made in Read's pamphlet. \\"Edwards's speech came as a bombshell. Mothers had not voluntarily given their children away,\\" she said. Rather, \\"the governments never intended that the children should ever return\\". Windschuttle argues that Read's \\"version of events was deeply comforting\\". \\"Mothers had not given their children away, fathers had not left their children destitute or deserted their families or been so consumed by alcohol they left them vulnerable to sexual predators\\"... \\"Aborigines could suddenly identify as morally innocent victims of a terrible injustice. Their problems could all be blamed on faceless white bureaucrats driven by racism. Since Read created this interpretation, it has come to be believed by most Aboriginal people in Australia.\\" With regard to the Human Rights Commission investigation into the Stolen Generations and their 1997 report entitled Bringing Them Home, he writes: \\"The empirical underpinnings of Bringing Them Home derived largely from the work of white academic historians. The Human Rights Commission did no serious research of its own into the primary historical sources. Co-authors Ronald Wilson and Mick Dodson also declined to hear any evidence that might have contradicted their preferred interpretation. They did not call witnesses from many of the still-living public officials responsible for child removal to hear or test their reasons for their policies and practices. The commission's only original contribution was to solicit the testimony of 535 Aboriginal people who had been removed from their parents and who spoke about their own experiences. While many of these stories were completely believable in what they said about what happened and how they felt, it is nonetheless true that when these witnesses were children they were not in a position to comprehend the question at the centre of the accusation of genocide, the motives of government policy makers\\". He argues that only a small number of children were actually removed (approximately 8,250 in the period 1880 to 1971), far less than the tens of thousands claimed, and that most of the removed children had been orphaned or were abandoned, destitute, neglected or subjected to various forms of exploitation and abuse. These removals were based on traditional grounds of child welfare. He argues that his analysis of welfare policy shows that none of the policies that allowed the removal of Aboriginal children were unique to Aborigines and that the evidence shows they were removed for the same child welfare reasons as white children who were in similar circumstances. \\"A significant number of other children were voluntarily placed in institutions by Aboriginal parents to give them an education and a better chance in life\\". In Western Australia, the majority of the children who are claimed to have been removed and placed in state Aboriginal settlements, in fact went to those settlements with their destitute parents. In New South Wales, Aboriginal children were placed in apprenticeships to enable them to acquire the skills to earn a living and be independent of welfare in a program that \\"was a replica of measures that had already been applied to white children in welfare institutions in New South Wales for several decades, and to poor English children for several centuries before that\\". Windschuttle argues that the evidence shows that the claims that parents were deliberately prevented from maintaining contact with their children and that the children were prevented from returning home are falsehoods. In New South Wales, for example, the relevant government board not only allowed parents to visit their children in the Aborigines Protection Board Children's Homes, it provided them with train fare and a daily living allowance to enable them to do so. When children of Aboriginal descent were apprenticed to employers, they often returned home for the holidays and when necessary, were accompanied by officers of the responsible government board to ensure they reached home safely. When they finished their apprenticeships, in common with apprentices of other races, they were free to go wherever they pleased including back to their original homes, permanently or for social visits. With respect to the testing of the claims in court, Windschuttle writes: \\"... when they tested specific policies before the Federal Court, and when they argued the general intentions of the parliaments and legislators before the High Court, the historians and political activists who invented the notion of the Stolen Generations proved incapable of substantiating their case. As far as Australia's highest courts are concerned, the central hypothesis of the Stolen Generations is legally extinct\\"... \\"The only legal cases with any potential credibility would be those made by individuals such as Bruce Trevorrow, who was unlawfully removed from his family and suffered badly as a result\\". However in the Trevorrow case, Windschuttle argues that the decision shows \\"that the actions of the Aborigines Protection Board in placing Bruce in foster care without his parents' agreement was actually illegal at the time\\" and not the result of a policy of removal but rather the illegal actions of welfare officials who believed, rightly or wrongly, that Bruce Trevorrow was neglected and that his health and life would be in danger if they returned him to his mother. The fact that Bruce Trevorrow's siblings were never removed is an indicator that there was no such policy and that welfare officials were not empowered to remove Aboriginal children on racial grounds. Future volumes In April 2010, Windschuttle announced that the two remaining books in the series, Volume Two on the Colonial Frontier from 1788 onwards, and Volume Four on the History Wars, originally projected for publication in 2003 and 2004, will be published at a date yet to be announced.http://www.stolengenerations.info/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=221&Itemid;=166 In December 2013, Windschuttle advised that he hopes to have Volume Two published \\"in time to take its place in the discussions about our past during the Anzac Centenary in April 2015\\".Quadrant, January‚ÄìFebruary 2014, p5 Hoax In January 2009, Windschuttle was hoaxed into publishing an article in Quadrant. The stated aim of the hoax was to expose Windschuttle's alleged right-wing bias by proving he would publish an inaccurate article and not check its footnotes or authenticity if it met his preconceptions. An author using the pseudonym \\"biotechnologist Dr Sharon Gould\\" submitted an article claiming that CSIRO had planned to produce food crops engineered with human genes. However, \\"Gould\\" revealed that she had regarded the article as an Alan Sokal style hoax, referring to an instance in which writings described as obvious scientific nonsense were submitted to and accepted by an academic journal.Graham Young, \\"The Windschuttle Hoax ‚Äì Replete with Irony,\\" Online Opinion, 12 January 2009. Based on the reporter's intimate knowledge of the hoax and what he described as her \\"triumphant\\" tone when disclosing the hoax to him, Windschuttle accused the online publication Crikey of being involved in the hoax, a claim Crikey denied.Keith Windschuttle, \\"Margaret Simons and an Apparent Hoax on Quadrant,\\" Quadrant, 6 January 2009.Margaret Simons, \\"How Windschuttle Swallowed a Hoax to Publish a Fake Story in Quadrant,\\" Crikey, 6 January 2009. Two days later, Crikey revealed that \\"Gould\\" was in fact the writer, editor and activist Katherine Wilson. Wilson agreed to being named by Crikey, as her name had already appeared in online speculation and it seemed likely that her identity was about to be revealed by other journalists.Margaret Simons, \\"Outing 'Sharon Gould': the Hoaxer's Identity Revealed,\\" Crikey, 8 January 2009 Reporters Kelly Burke and Julie Robotham note that: > ‚Ä¶ the projects cited by \\"Gould\\" as having been dumped by the organisation > [CSIRO] are not in themselves implausible, and similar technologies are in > active development. Human vaccines against diseases including hepatitis B, > respiratory syncytial virus and Norwalk virus have been genetically > engineered into crops as diverse as lettuce, potato and corn, and shown to > provoke an immune response in humans. Gould also suggests the CSIRO > abandoned research into the creation of dairy cattle capable of producing > non-allergenic milk for lactose-intolerant infants and a genetically > engineered mosquito that could stimulate antibodies against malaria in > humans who were bitten, mitigating against (sic) the spread of the disease. > Both ideas are under serious scientific study by research groups around the > world.Kelly Burke and Julie Robotham, \\"Plausible Inventions Lie Alongside > the Facts,\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, January 7, 2009. The hoax elements of the article published in Quadrant were that the CSIRO had planned such research, that they had abandoned it because of perceived public moral or ethical objections and that evidence of this was \\"buried\\" in footnotes to an article in a scientific journal and in two annual reports of the CSIRO, the relevant report years being unspecified. Windschuttle states: > A real hoax, like that of Alan Sokal and Ern Malley, is designed to expose > editors who are pretentious, ignorant or at least over-enthusiastic about > certain subjects. The technique is to submit obvious nonsense for > publication in order to expose the editor's ignorance of the topic.

Finally, he made his debut with the Mariners on April 3, 2002. Ugueto was a promising young infielder with a strong arm and blistering speed on the bases. What Seattle hoped would develop was his bat and his overall feel for the game, especially defensively, at the major league level. In two seasons as a backup with the Mariners, Ugueto batted .214 with one home run and two RBI in 74 games. Ugueto signed with the Kansas City Royals prior to the 2005 season and spent the season with the Royals' top minor league club, the Omaha Royals. While with Omaha, he was suspended twice for violating baseball's steroid policy, and he was released by the Royals after the second violation.

He is widely seen as a foundational figure in Indian English literature. His poems are a meaningful and substantial contribution to Indian and World literature. Early life Dom Moraes was born in Bombay (now Mumbai) to Beryl and Frank Moraes, former editor of The Times of India and later The Indian Express. He had a tormented relationship with his mother Beryl, who had been confined to a mental asylum since his childhood. His aunt was the historian Teresa Albuquerque. He attended the city's St. Mary's School, and then left for England to enrol at Jesus College, Oxford. Moraes spent eight years in Britain, in London and Oxford, New York City, Hong Kong, Delhi and Bombay (now Mumbai). Career David Archer published his first collection of poems, A Beginning, in 1957. When he was 19, still an undergraduate, he became the first Indian to win the Hawthornden Prize and was presented with ¬£100 and a silver medal by Lord David Cecil at the Arts Council of Britain on 10 July 1958. He edited magazines in London, Hong Kong and New York. He became the editor of The Asia Magazine in 1971. He scripted and partially directed over 20 television documentaries for the BBC and ITV. He was a war correspondent in Algeria, Israel and Vietnam. In 1976 he joined the United Nations. Moraes conducted one of the first interviews of the Dalai Lama after the Tibetan spiritual leader fled to India in 1959. The Dalai Lama was then 23 and Moraes, 20. Later life He had a lifelong battle with alcoholism. Moraes suffered from cancer, but refused treatment and died from a heart attack in Bandra, Mumbai. He was buried in the city's Sewri Cemetery and as per his last wishes Sarayu Srivatsa buried the soil from his grave in Odcombe, Somerset, on 19 July 2002 (his birthdate). Many of Dom's old friends and publishers attended the memorial service in Odcombe. A headstone in yellow Jaisalmer stone lies embedded in the front lawn of the Church of St Peter and St Paul to mark the service. In 1961‚Äì62 he was one of the very few public Indian figures to strongly criticize the Indian Army takeover of Goa, land of his forefathers ‚Äì Daman and Diu from Portuguese India. He tore up his Indian passport on TV in protest. He was later allowed back in the country. When the Gujarat riots erupted in 2002, with their heavy toll of Muslim dead, Moraes left for Ahmedabad the minute the news came through, saying that since he was a Catholic, Muslims would not see him as an enemy. Even though he was physically in considerable pain by then, he was one of the first on the scene. Moraes ended his writing career, writing books in collaboration with Sarayu Srivatsa. Personal life In 1956, aged 18, he was courted by Audrey Wendy Abbott who later changed her name to Henrieta. They married in 1961. He left her, according to his close friends in London, but did not divorce her. He had a son, Francis Moraes, with his second wife Judith, whom he divorced and returned to India in 1968. In 1969, he married the Indian actress Leela Naidu. They were treated as a star couple, and known across the world for over two decades. Their marriage ended in a separation. For the last 13 years of his life he lived with Sarayu Srivatsa, with whom he co-authored two books. Bibliography * 1951: Green is the Grass, a book of cricket essaysJames D.

The Marine Biological Research Station, Ratnagiri is one of the premier institutes, especially in the South Konkan Coastal Fisheries Zone, having a mandate for development of fish production technologies, transferring the technologies to fish culturists, entrepreneurs and the industry, and generating professionally trained manpower in fish culture. History Thibaw Palace Ratnagiri was an administrative capital under the Sultanate of Bijapur. In 1731 it came under the control of the Kingdom of Satara, and in 1818 it was annexed to British India. A fortbuilt by the Bijapur reconstructed by the Maratha king Shivaji in 1670 is located on a headland near the harbour. Ratnagiri is the birthplace of Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He was born on 23 July 1856 after which he moved to Pune with his family when he was 10 years old. It was also then place of confinement for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar from 1921 to 1935. In 1886, King Thibaw of Burma was sent to Ratnagiri after he was deposed and his country annexed by the British Empire. Along with his pregnant wife, his junior queen, and his two young daughters, he would live out the rest of his life in Ratnagiri, as a prisoner of the British Crown. Ratnagiri was chosen for its remote location, some 3,000 miles from Thibaw's former royal seat of Mandalay, accessible only by sea for parts of the year and far from any territory of any rival European power.

The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten- containing cereals. Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy. In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten. People with poor basic education and understanding of a gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors. In addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak. Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education. A gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. Furthermore, they contain protein of higher nutritional quality than those of wheat, and in greater quantities. Rationale behind adoption of the diet One breadcrumb of this size contains enough gluten to reactivate the autoimmune response in people with coeliac disease when they are following a gluten-free diet, although obvious symptoms may not appear. Consuming gluten even in small quantities, which may be the result of inadvertent cross-contamination, impede recovery in people with gluten-related disorders. Coeliac disease Coeliac disease (American English: celiac) (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated, and mainly intestinal process, caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye and derivatives, that appears in genetically predisposed people of all ages. Coeliac disease is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may affect several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may often be completely asymptomatic. Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers (anti-tissue transglutaminase [TG2]) are not always present and many people with coeliac may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the intestinal villi. A 2017 study found that gluten is not related to a risk of coronary heart disease in people without celiac disease. Coeliac disease affects approximately 1%‚Äì2% of the general population all over the world and is on the increase, but most cases remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, exposing patients to the risk of long-term complications. People may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years before a proper diagnosis is achieved. Untreated coeliac disease may cause malabsorption, reduced quality of life, iron deficiency, osteoporosis, obstetric complications (stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for gestational age), an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas and greater mortality. Coeliac disease is associated with some autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroiditis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more. Coeliac disease with \\"classic symptoms\\", which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhoea and abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and impaired growth, is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly to small children generally younger than two years of age. Coeliac disease with \\"non-classic symptoms\\" is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children (over 2 years old), adolescents and adults. It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic both in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults. Following a lifelong gluten-free diet is the only medically-accepted treatment for people with coeliac disease. Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a gluten-free diet, after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are excluded. People with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, which resemble those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include any of the following: abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhoea or constipation), nausea, aerophagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aphthous stomatitis. A range of extra-intestinal symptoms, said to be the only manifestation of NCGS in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, have been suggested, but remain controversial. These include: headache, migraine, \\"foggy mind\\", fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, tingling of the extremities, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), atopic disorders such as asthma, rhinitis, other allergies, depression, anxiety, iron-deficiency anemia, folate deficiency or autoimmune diseases. NCGS has also been controversially implicated in some neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, eating disorders, autism, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Above 20% of people with NCGS have IgE-mediated allergy to one or more inhalants, foods or metals, among which most common are mites, graminaceae, parietaria, cat or dog hair, shellfish and nickel. Approximately, 35% of people with NCGS suffer other food intolerances, mainly lactose intolerance. The pathogenesis of NCGS is not yet well understood. For this reasons, it is a controversial syndrome and some authors still question it. There is evidence that not only gliadin (the main cytotoxic antigen of gluten), but also other proteins named ATIs which are present in gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley, and their derivatives) may have a role in the development of symptoms. ATIs are potent activators of the innate immune system. FODMAPs, especially fructans, are present in small amounts in gluten-containing grains and have been identified as a possible cause of some gastrointestinal symptoms in persons with NCGS. As of 2019, reviews have concluded that although FODMAPs may play a role in NCGS, they only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but not the extra-digestive symptoms that people with NCGS may develop, such as neurological disorders, fibromyalgia, psychological disturbances, and dermatitis. After exclusion of coeliac disease and wheat allergy, the subsequent step for diagnosis and treatment of NCGS is to start a strict gluten-free diet to assess if symptoms improve or resolve completely. This may occur within days to weeks of starting a GFD, but improvement may also be due to a non-specific, placebo response. Recommendations may resemble those for coeliac disease, for the diet to be strict and maintained, with no transgression. The degree of gluten cross contamination tolerated by people with NCGS is not clear but there is some evidence that they can present with symptoms even after consumption of small amounts. It is not yet known whether NCGS is a permanent or a transient condition. A trial of gluten reintroduction to observe any reaction after 1‚Äì2 years of strict gluten-free diet might be performed. A subgroup of people with NCGS may not improve by eating commercially available gluten-free products, which are usually rich of preservatives and additives, because chemical additives (such as sulphites, glutamates, nitrates and benzoates) might have a role in evoking functional gastrointestinal symptoms of NCGS. These people may benefit from a diet with a low content of preservatives and additives. NCGS, which is possibly immune- mediated, now appears to be more common than coeliac disease, with prevalence rates between 0.5‚Äì13% in the general population. Wheat allergy People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a wheat allergy. Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. Wheat allergy has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could be anaphylaxis. The management of wheat allergy consists of complete withdrawal of any food containing wheat and other gluten-containing cereals. Nevertheless, some people with wheat allergy can tolerate barley, rye or oats.  Gluten ataxia  A male with gluten ataxia: previous situation and evolution after 3 months of gluten-free diet. Gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten. With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing, with loss of Purkinje cells. People with gluten ataxia usually present gait abnormality or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs. Gaze-evoked nystagmus and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common. Myoclonus, palatal tremor, and opsoclonus-myoclonus may also appear. Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible. Gluten ataxia accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias. Less than 10% of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom, yet about 40% have intestinal damage. As a fad diet Since the beginning of the 21st century, the gluten-free diet has become the most popular fad diet in the United States and other countries. Clinicians worldwide have been challenged by an increasing number of people who do not have coeliac disease nor wheat allergy, with digestive or extra- digestive symptoms which improved removing wheat/gluten from the diet. Many of these persons began a gluten-free diet on their own, without having been previously evaluated. Another reason that contributed to this trend was the publication of several books that demonize gluten and point to it as a cause of type 2 diabetes, weight gain and obesity, and a broad list of diseases ranging from depression and anxiety to arthritis and autism. The book that has had the most impact is Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar - Your Brain's Silent Killers, by the American neurologist David Perlmutter, published in September 2013. Another book that has had great impact is Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health, by the cardiologist William Davis, which refers to wheat as a \\"chronic poison\\" and became a New York Times bestseller within a month of publication in 2011. The gluten-free diet has been advocated and followed by many celebrities to lose weight, such as Miley Cyrus, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kourtney Kardashian, and are used by some professional athletes, who believe the diet can improve energy and health. It became popular in the US, as the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets faded. Estimates suggest that in 2014, 30% of people in the US and Australia were consuming gluten-free foods, with a growing number, calculated from surveys that by 2016 approximately 100 million Americans would consume gluten-free products. Data from a 2015 Nielsen survey of 30,000 adults in 60 countries around the world conclude that 21% of people prefer to buy gluten-free foods, being the highest interest among the younger generations. In the US, it was estimated that more than half of people who buy foods labeled gluten-free do not have a clear reaction to gluten, and they do so \\"because they think it will help them lose weight, because they seem to feel better or because they mistakenly believe they are sensitive to gluten.\\" Although gluten is highly immunologically reactive and humans appear not to have evolved to digest it well, a gluten-free diet is not a healthier option for the general population, other than people suffering from gluten-related disorders or other associated conditions which improve with a gluten-free diet in some cases, such as irritable bowel syndrome and certain autoimmune and neurological disorders. There is no published experimental evidence to support that the gluten-free diet contributes to weight loss. In a review of May 2015 published in Gastroenterology, Fasano et al. conclude that, although there is an evident \\"fad component\\" to the recent rise in popularity of the gluten-free diet, there is also growing and unquestionable evidence of the existence of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The popularity of the gluten-free diet is hurting people who actually need to eliminate gluten due to medical reasons. The servers are issuing judgments, believing that it is simply a fad, which is leading to them not taking the necessary precautions in the handling of the food to avoid gluten cross-contamination. \\"In other words, the customers who 'order gluten-free meals washed down with a gluten-filled beer' are essentially making a mockery of a serious issue\\". Even many professionals in the medical field think that the gluten-free diet is just a fad. On the other hand, the popularity of the gluten-free diet has increased the availability of commercial gluten-free replacement products and gluten-free grains. Gluten- free commercial replacement products, such as gluten-free cakes, are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts, so their purchase adds a financial burden. They are also typically higher in calories, fat, and sugar, and lower in dietary fibre. In less developed countries, wheat can represent an important source of protein, since it is a substantial part of the diet in the form of bread, noodles, bulgur, couscous, and other products.Shewry P.R. \\"Seed Proteins\\". In: Black M., Bewley J.D., editors. Seed Technology and Its Biological Basis. Sheffield Academic Press; Sheffield, UK: 2000. pp. 42‚Äì84. In the British National Health Service, gluten-free foods have been supplied on prescription. For many patients, this meant at no cost. When it was proposed to alter this in 2018, the Department of Health and Social Care made an assessment of the costs and benefits. The potential annual financial saving to the service was estimated at ¬£5.3 million, taking into account the reduction in cost spending and the loss of income from prescription charges. The proposed scenario was actually that patients could still be prescribed gluten- free breads and mixes but would have to buy any other gluten-free products themselves. The savings would only amount to ¬£700,000 a year. Local initiatives by clinical commissioning groups had already reduced the cost of gluten-free foods to the NHS by 39% between 2015 and 2017. Healthcare professionals recommend against undertaking a gluten-free diet as a form of self-diagnosis, because tests for coeliac disease are reliable only if the person has been consuming gluten recently. There is a consensus in the medical community that people should consult a physician before going on a gluten-free diet, so that a medical professional can accurately test for coeliac disease or any other gluten-induced health issues. Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit in reducing the symptoms of autism.  Research  In a 2013 double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge (DBPC) by Biesiekierski et al. in a few people with irritable bowel syndrome, the authors found no difference between gluten or placebo groups and the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity as a syndrome was questioned. Nevertheless, this study had design errors and an incorrect selection of participants, and probably the reintroduction of both gluten and whey protein had a nocebo effect similar in all people, and this could have masked the true effect of gluten/wheat reintroduction. In a 2015 double-blind placebo cross-over trial, small amounts of purified wheat gluten triggered gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal bloating and pain) and extra-intestinal manifestations (such as foggy mind, depression and aphthous stomatitis) in self-reported non- celiac gluten sensitivity. Nevertheless, it remains elusive whether these findings specifically implicate gluten or other proteins present in gluten- containing cereals. In a 2018 double-blind, crossover research study on 59 persons on a gluten-free diet with challenges of gluten, fructans or placebo, intestinal symptoms (specifically bloating) were borderline significantly higher after challenge with fructans, in comparison with gluten proteins (P=0.049). Although the differences between the three interventions was very small, the authors concluded that fructans (the specific type of FODMAP found in wheat) are more likely to be the cause of gastrointestinal symptoms of non- celiac gluten sensitivity, rather than gluten. In addition, fructans used in the study were extracted from chicory root, so it remains to be seen whether the wheat fructans produce the same effect.  Eating gluten-free  Quinoa is a pseudocereal that is gluten-free. Gluten-free bread made of a mixture of flours like buckwheat flour, tapioca flour, millet flour and psyllium seed husks. Special flour mixes can be bought for bread-making purposes. A gluten- free diet is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, proteins present in wheat (and all wheat varieties such as spelt and kamut), barley, rye, oat, and derivatives of these grains such as malt and triticale, and foods that may include them, or shared transportation or processing facilities with them. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial. Oat toxicity in people with gluten-related disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties. Furthermore, oats are frequently cross-contaminated with the other gluten-containing cereals. Pure oat (labelled as \\"pure oat\\" or \\"gluten-free oat\\") refers to oats uncontaminated with any of the other gluten-containing cereals. Some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a gluten-free diet, requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of pure oats consumption are still unclear and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in the gluten- free diet. Other grains, although gluten-free in themselves, may contain gluten by cross-contamination with gluten-containing cereals during grain harvesting, transporting, milling, storing, processing, handling or cooking. Processed foods commonly contain gluten as an additive (as emulsifiers, thickeners, gelling agents, fillers, and coatings), so they would need specific labeling. Unexpected sources of gluten are, among others, processed meat, vegetarian meat substitutes, reconstituted seafood, stuffings, butter, seasonings, marinades, dressings, confectionary, candies, and ice cream. Gluten-free rice flour Cross-contamination in the home is also a consideration for those who suffer from gluten-related disorders. There can be many sources of cross-contamination, as for example when family members prepare gluten-free and gluten-containing foods on the same surfaces (countertops, tables, etc.) or share utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (cutting boards, colanders, cutlery, etc.), kitchen equipment (toaster, cupboards, etc.) or certain packaged foods (butter, peanut butter, etc.). Medications and dietary supplements are made using excipients that may contain gluten. The gluten-free diet includes naturally gluten-free food, such as meat, fish, seafood, eggs, milk and dairy products, nuts, legumes, fruit, vegetables, potatoes, pseudocereals (in particular amaranth, buckwheat, chia seed, quinoa), only certain cereal grains (corn, rice, sorghum), minor cereals (including fonio, Job's tears, millet, teff, called \\"minor\\" cereals as they are \\"less common and are only grown in a few small regions of the world\\"),. See Table 2 and page 21. some other plant products (arrowroot, mesquite flour,O'Brian T, Ford R, Kupper C, Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: The evolving spectrum, pp. 305‚Äì330. In: sago, tapioca) and products made from these gluten-free foods. Risks An unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins and a higher intake of sugars and saturated fats. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid / carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. These nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have higher biological and nutritional value. Advances towards higher nutrition-content gluten-free bakery products, improved for example in terms of fiber content and glycemic index, have been made by using not exclusively corn starch or other starches to substitute for flour. In this aim, for example the dietary fibre inulin (which acts as a prebiotic) or quinoa or amaranth wholemeal have been as substitute for part of the flour. Such substitution has been found to also yield improved crust and texture of bread. It is recommended that anyone embarking on a gluten-free diet check with a registered dietitian to make sure they are getting the required amount of key nutrients like iron, calcium, fiber, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate. Vitamins often contain gluten as a binding agent. Experts have advised that it is important to always read the content label of any product that is intended to be swallowed. Up to 30% of people with known coeliac disease often continue having or redeveloping symptoms. Also, a lack of symptoms or negative blood antibodies levels are not reliable indicators of intestinal recuperation. Several studies show an incomplete recovery of small bowel despite a strict gluten-free diet, and about 79% of such people have persistent villous atrophy. This lack of recovery is mainly caused by inadvertent exposure to gluten. People with poor basic education and understanding of the gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors. In addition, some people often deliberately continue eating gluten because of limited availability, inferior taste, higher price, and inadequate labelling of gluten-free products. Poor compliance with the regimen is also influenced by age at diagnosis (adolescents), ignorance of the consequences of the lack of a strict treatment and certain psychological factors. Ongoing gluten intake can cause severe disease complications, such as various types of cancers (both intestinal and extra-intestinal) and osteoporosis.  Regulation and labels The term gluten-free is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A 2008 systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg (10 ppm) of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done. Regulation of the label gluten-free varies by country. Most countries derive key provisions of their gluten-free labelling regulations from the Codex Alimentarius international standards for food labelling as a standard relating to the labelling of products as gluten-free. It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten. Gluten-free is defined as 20 ppm (= 20 mg/kg) or less. It categorizes gluten-free food as: * Food that is gluten-free by composition * Food that has become gluten-free through special processing. * Reduced gluten content, food which includes food products with between 20 and 100 ppm of gluten Reduced gluten content is left up to individual nations to more specifically define. The Codex Standard suggests the enzyme-linked Immunoassay (ELISA) R5 Mendez method for indicating the presence of gluten, but allows for other relevant methods, such as DNA. The Codex Standard specifies that the gluten-free claim must appear in the immediate proximity of the name of the product, to ensure visibility. There is no general agreement on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products. The ELISA method was designed to detect w-gliadins, but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins. The use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify gluten-free food products. The European Union, World Health Organization, and Codex Alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins, gliadins rather than all-wheat proteins.Codex Alimentarius (2003) Draft revised standards for gluten-free foods, report of the 25th session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, November 2003 Australia The Australian government recommends that: * food labelled gluten-free include no detectable gluten (<3ppm ) oats or their products, cereals containing gluten that have been malted or their products * food labelled low gluten claims such that the level of 20 mg gluten per 100 g of the food Brazil All food products must be clearly labelled whether they contain gluten or they are gluten-free. Since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. When a product contains the warning of cross-contamination with wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybridised strains, the warning \\"contains gluten\\" is mandatory. The law does not establish a gluten threshold for the declaration of its absence. Canada Health Canada considers that foods containing levels of gluten not exceeding 20 ppm as a result of contamination, meet the health and safety intent of section B.24.018 of the Food and Drug Regulations when a gluten-free claim is made. Any intentionally added gluten, even at low levels must be declared on the packaging and a gluten-free claim would be considered false and misleading. Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 10 ppm. European Union The EU European Commission delineates the categories as: * gluten-free: 20 ppm or less of gluten * very low gluten foodstuffs: 20-100ppm gluten. All foods containing gluten as an ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognised EU allergens. United States Until 2012 anyone could use the gluten-free claim with no repercussion. In 2008, Wellshire Farms chicken nuggets labelled gluten-free were purchased and samples were sent to a food allergy laboratory where they were found to contain gluten. After this was reported in the Chicago Tribune, the products continued to be sold. The manufacturer has since replaced the batter used in its chicken nuggets. The U.S. first addressed gluten-free labelling in the 2004 Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau published interim rules and proposed mandatory labelling for alcoholic products in 2006. (26 July 2006), (26 July 2006) The FDA issued their Final Rule on August 5, 2013. (5 August 2013). Codified at . When a food producer voluntarily chooses to use a gluten-free claim for a product, the food bearing the claim in its labelling may not contain: * an ingredient that is a gluten- containing grain * an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain that has not been processed to remove gluten * an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain, that has been processed to remove gluten but results in the presence of 20 ppm or more gluten in the food. Any food product claiming to be gluten-free and also bearing the term \\"wheat\\" in its ingredient list or in a separate \\"Contains wheat\\" statement, must also include the language \\"*the wheat has been processed to allow this food to meet the FDA requirements for gluten-free foods,\\" in close proximity to the ingredient statement. Any food product that inherently does not contain gluten may use a gluten-free label where any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food bearing the claim in its labelling is below 20 ppm gluten.

He previously played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres. He also played in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. Career Signed by Oakland as an amateur free agent in 1994, Salazar was selected off waivers by the Detroit Tigers in 2002, making his debut in that season. In one season as a backup with the Tigers, Salazar batted .190 with one home run and three RBI in three games. In 2003, Salazar was diagnosed with injuries in his arm and shoulder which required season-ending surgery. He worked out in 2004 spring training, but his recovery was slower than expected. He played that season for the Buffalo Bisons, the Cleveland Indians' Triple-A team. In 2005, Salazar played for Canc√∫n of the Mexican League. He played for his hometown team, the Tigres de Aragua the Caribbean Series, after he plays on his actual team, Tiburones de La Guaira. Baltimore Orioles Salazar joined the Orioles system in 2007, when he played for the Bowie Baysox of the Double-A Eastern League. He began 2008 with the Norfolk Tides of the International League. On June 10, 2008, Salazar was called up to the Orioles to replace struggling starter Steve Trachsel on the roster.

Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. Ricotta (literally meaning \\"recooked\\", \\"refined\\") protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by letting it sit for 12‚Äì24 hours at room temperature). Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling. The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to precipitate, forming a fine curd. Once cooled, it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth, leaving the curd behind. Ricotta curds are creamy white in appearance, and slightly sweet in taste. The fat content changes depending on the brand and the type of milk used. In this form, it is somewhat similar in texture to some cottage cheese variants, though considerably lighter. It is highly perishable. However, ricotta also is made in aged varieties which are preservable for much longer.  History  The production of ricotta in the Italian peninsula dates back to the Bronze Age. In the second millennium BC, ceramic vessels called milk boilers started to appear frequently and were apparently unique to the peninsula. These were designed to boil milk at high temperatures and prevent the milk from boiling over. The fresh acid-coagulated cheeses produced with these boilers were probably made with whole milk. However, the production of rennet-coagulated cheese overtook the production of fresh whole-milk cheeses during the first millennium BC. Bronze cheese graters found in the graves of the Etruscan elite prove that hard-grating cheeses were popular with the aristocracy. Cheese graters were also commonly used in ancient Roman kitchens. Unlike the fresh acid-coagulated cheese, aged rennet-coagulated cheese could be preserved for much longer. The increased production of rennet-coagulated cheese led to a large supply of sweet whey as a byproduct. Cheesemakers then started using a new recipe, which used a mixture of whey and milk to make the traditional ricotta as it is known today. The ancient Romans made ricotta, but writers on agriculture such as Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, and Columella do not mention it. They described the production of rennet- coagulated cheese but did not write about milk boilers or acid-coagulated cheese. A likely reason is that ricotta was not profitable because its very short shelf life did not allow distribution to urban markets. Ricotta was most likely consumed by the shepherds who made it. Even so, evidence from paintings and literature indicates that ricotta was known and likely eaten by Roman aristocrats as well. Ceramic milk boilers were still used by Apennine shepherds to make ricotta in the 19th century AD. Today, metal milk boilers are used, but production methods have changed little since ancient times.  Manufacturing process  Whey protein is a kind of milk protein but there are numerous other milk proteins. Whey itself comprises less than 1% of total milk protein, by weight. Accordingly, ricotta production requires large volumes of input milk. The production process entails the use of heat and acid to coagulate whey protein from whey solution. The whey solution is heated to a near-boiling temperature, much hotter than during the production of the original cheese, of which the whey is a remnant.  Fresh variants  The original ricotta is made of whey with the addition of a small amount of milk, but more recently ricotta has been made of whole milk as well. Whole-milk ricotta is primarily popular in the USA, where whey ricotta is known by the name ricottone. Ricotta di Bufala Campana and Ricotta Romana are notable varieties produced in Italy and protected by the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin regulation. Ricotta di Bufala Campana is made from the whey left over after the production of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected variety of buffalo mozzarella. Ricotta Romana is made from the whey of sheep milk.  Aged variants  Ricotta salata is a firm, salted variety of ricotta smoked variety from the Sila in Calabria Ricotta forte is a very soft variety from Apulia sold in jars. Fresh ricotta can be subject to extra processing to produce variants which have a much longer shelf life. These production methods include salting, baking, smoking, and further fermentation. Ricotta salata is a pressed, salted, dried, and aged variety of the cheese. It is milky-white and firm and used for grating or shaving. Ricotta salata is sold in wheels, decorated by a delicate basket-weave pattern. Ricotta infornata (baked ricotta) is produced by placing a large lump of soft ricotta in the oven until it develops a brown, lightly charred crust, sometimes even until it becomes sandy brown all the way through. Ricotta infornata is popular primarily in Sardinia and Sicily, and is sometimes called ricotta al forno. Ricotta affumicata (smoked ricotta) is similar to ricotta infornata and is produced by placing a lump of soft ricotta in a smoker until it develops a grey crust and acquires a charred wood scent, usually of oak or chestnut wood, although, in Friuli, beech wood is used, with the addition of juniper and herbs.MondoFriuli (click on Formaggi) Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat, or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to age for about a year, during which salt is added and the cheese mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold. The end result is a soft and creamy brown paste which has a very pungent and piquant taste. It is produced in the southern part of the Province of Lecce and sold in glass jars. It is smeared on bread, mixed with tomato sauces for pasta, or added to vegetable dishes.  Common culinary uses  Like mascarpone in northern Italian cuisine, ricotta is a favorite component of many Italian desserts, such as cheesecakes and cannoli. Also, a variety of different cookies include ricotta as an ingredient. Ricotta can be beaten smooth and mixed with condiments, such as sugar, cinnamon, orange flower water, strawberries, and occasionally chocolate shavings, and served as a dessert. This basic combination (often with additions such as citrus and pistachios) also features prominently as the filling of the Sicilian cannoli and layered with slices of cake in Palermo's cassata. Combined with eggs and cooked grains, then baked firm, ricotta is also a main ingredient in Neapolitan pastiera, one of Italy's many \\"Easter pies\\". Ricotta is also commonly used in savory dishes, including pasta, calzone, stromboli, pizza, manicotti, lasagne, and ravioli. It also is used as a mayonnaise substitute in traditional egg or tuna salad and as a sauce thickener. Local ricotta is dried in the sun and made into a hard, chewy tablet called chhurpi in Himalayan areas, notably in Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling and parts of Nepal. The fresh, soft chhurpi is the main ingredient in the Bhutanese national dish of ema datshi. It is often used as a substitute for paneer or chena (though the two are not identical) in the Indian dessert known as ras malai. However, paneer is mostly casein protein, similar to cottage cheese, while ricotta is made of all whey protein.  Similar non-Italian cheeses  In the United States, American ricotta is almost always made of cow's milk whey, as opposed to Italian ricotta which is typically made from the whey of sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk. While both types are low in fat and sodium, the Italian version is naturally sweet, while the American is a little saltier and more moist. In Tunisia, the rigouta from the city of B√©ja is a close relative to the ricotta, except that it is always fresh-soft and is not aged. It is exclusively made from the whey of Sicilo-Sarda sheep's milk. Rigouta is also used as the basis of several preparations and dishes of Tunisian cuisine. In Spanish, ricotta is known as reques√≥n. It can be salted or sweetened for cooking purposes. It was brought to Mexico by the Spaniards, although it is not as commonly used as queso fresco. It is sometimes used as filling for tlacoyos and tacos dorados, and in the central west area (Jalisco, Michoac√°n, and Colima) it is spread over tostadas or bolillos, or served as a side to beans. In Portugal and Brazil, a similar product is called requeij√£o. In the Balkans, Romanian urdƒÉ (), Macedonian urda (—É—Ä–¥–∞) and Bulgarian izvara (–∏–∑–≤–∞—Ä–∞) are made by reprocessing the whey drained from any type of cheese. UrdƒÉ is thus similar to fresh ricotta as its fabrication implies the same technological process.DEX dictionary definition of urdƒÉJurnalul Oficial al Uniunii Europene - in the Romanian version of the Official Journal of the EU ricotta is translated by urdƒÉ (page 4, subchapter 5.3.). However, Romanian urdƒÉ is neither smoked nor baked in the oven like some variants of the Italian ricotta. UrdƒÉ has been produced by Romanian shepherds for centuries and is consequently regarded by Romanians as a Romanian traditional product.Official site of the Directia pentru Agricultura si Dezvoltare Rurala Sibiu - UrdƒÉ is presented as a traditional dairy product. In Greece, very similar to ricotta are anthotyros (Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œåœÑœÖœÅŒø) and manouri (ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœçœÅŒπ), made from sheep or goat milk. Similarly in Cyprus, anari (Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÅŒÆ) is made from the same types of milk. Indian khoa is often confused with ricotta, but the two are very different. Khoa is lower in moisture than ricotta and made from whole milk instead of whey. Ricotta is similar to Indian chhena or paneer, and not at all like khoa; it can be substituted for the same in the making of Indian sweets such as sondesh or dishes such as palak paneer, but paneer and chhena are made from whole milk, usually from water buffalo, as the milk is high in fat. The process of making the curds uses citric acid or lime or lemon juice, but never rennet.

The atoll consists of a variable number of flat and sandy islets, typically between five and seven. More were noted in historical sources but have since been lost to erosion and rising sea levels. The atoll is named after Pearl and , a pair of English whaleships that wrecked there in 1822. It has been the site of at least eight known shipwrecks, including the Japanese Wiji Maru, SS Quartette, and most recently the M/V Casitas, which ran aground on the reef in 2005. The atoll is an important habitat for seabirds, marine life, and invertebrate species. Twenty-two bird species nest and breed on the islands, including twenty percent of the world's population of black-footed albatrosses. The atoll has historically been included with the rest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in conservation efforts. It is included in the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument, created in 2006. Ghost nets and other fishing debris, rising sea levels, and the invasive-like algae Chondria tumulosa pose a significant risk to the atoll and its wildlife. Geography The Pearl and Hermes Atoll is the third northernmost atoll of Hawaii, behind Midway and Kure, approximately northwest of Honolulu and east-southeast of Midway Atoll. Like the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, the atoll observes Hawaii Standard Time. In total, Pearl and Hermes has about of land and almost of coral reef habitat. The fringing coral reef which surrounds the atoll is roughly in circumference and open to the west. The atoll's land area consists of several small islands which are periodically washed over when winter storms pass, along with several ephemeral sand spits. The islets are low and flat, and there are no sources of fresh water on any of them. As of 2012, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the atoll consists of five islands: Southeast Island (the largest), North Island, Little North Island, Grass Island, and Seal-Kittery. Earlier sources note the presence of other islets, including a Sand Island and a Bird Island. Nomenclature The Hawaiian-language name for the atoll, Holoikauaua, was established in the late 1990s by the Hawaiian Lexicon Committee following an effort to restore traditional Hawaiian names which had been lost, misspelled, or replaced with foreign names. Because its original Hawaiian name was not known, the Committee conferred the new name of Holoikauaua to the atoll, in reference to the Hawaiian monk seal which frequents the waters there. History NOAA bathymetric map Initial discovery The atoll was discovered in 1822 when the English whaleships Pearl and Hermes ran aground on the surrounding reefs. The two ships had been en route to Japan from Honolulu through the uncharted waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Sometime late in the evening of April 24 or early in the morning of April 25, the 258-ton Hermes ran aground on an unseen reef. Shortly thereafter, the 327-ton Pearl also ran aground when it approached to provide assistance. The combined crews of both ships, some 57 sailors, were marooned on an unspecified island nearby for several months. During that time, James Robinson, a carpenter's mate, directed the construction of a small 30-ton vessel from the wreckage. Some accounts provide the name of the vessel as Drift, while others state it was called Deliverance. On July 1, before the beach-built vessel could be launched, the passing ship Earl of Morby was sighted. 46 of the sailors took passage on the Earl of Morby, but Robinson and eleven others opted to purchase the vessel they had built and sail it back to Honolulu in the hopes of recovering some of the losses incurred by the wreck. The sailors managed to sail the small vessel back to the main Hawaiian islands without further loss of life. They sold it for $2,000 USD. Robinson remained in Honolulu, and founded the James Robinson and Company shipyard there in 1827. King Kamehameha III of Hawaii claimed the atoll by proclamation in 1854. In 1857, it was surveyed by the crew of the Hawaiian schooner Manuokawai. The United States took possession of the atoll in 1859 by way of Captain N.C. Brooks and his ship Gambia. Brooks reported that the atoll had eleven or twelve islets, and that some of them had trees and coarse grass. In 1867, the crew of the Laconda produced the first reliable chart of the reef, which was published by the United States Navy. Entrepreneurs from a rabbit canning business intentionally released rabbits on Southeast Island in 1894, where they devoured all the island's vegetation. This was the first documented instance of mammals being introduced to the atoll. The Japanese schooner Wiji Maru crashed on the atoll in 1904, destroying the ship and losing its cargo of feathers. There was no loss of life, however. In 1916, crew members from the Thetis reported that they had spotted rabbits and Japanese fishing huts on Southeast Island. In 1923, the vessels of the Tanager Expedition stopped at the atoll and killed \\"all but one rabbit on Southeast Island.\\" Exploitation of oysters Black- lip pearl oyster at the Aquarium Finisterrae in Galicia, Spain In 1927, Captain William Greig Anderson of the Lanikai Fishing Company was fishing for tuna and in the process, discovered beds of black-lip pearl oysters in the atoll. He reported that they were rich with pearls ‚Äì the only pearl beds in the United States. Anderson formed a trading company to capitalize on his find. Over the next three years, his trading company harvested some 20,000 pearls from the atoll, with the largest of these having a reported value of US$5,000. Some 150 tons of oyster shells, valued for their shiny mother-of- pearl, were harvested in the process. They were primarily sold to button manufacturers on the United States mainland. In 1929, oyster harvesting in the atoll was made illegal by the government of the Territory of Hawaii. In 1930, the United States Bureau of Fisheries decided to conduct a thorough study of the atoll, led by Dr. Paul Galtsoff. The United States Navy loaned the minesweeper ship Whippoorwill for the five-week expedition, which covered the reef's geography, flora, and invertebrate and fish populations. A specific emphasis was placed on the pearl oyster population. Only 470 oysters were found. 320 were collected alive, and 150 were opened for examination. An estimated 10% contained pearls. Based on those findings, the surveyors concluded that Captain Anderson must have harvested between 150,000-200,000 oysters to obtain his reported 20,000 pearls, which had significantly depleted the oyster beds. The Whippoorwill expedition documented wildlife aside from the oysters: Dr. Galtsoff's report indicated that they had found seals, sharks, sea turtles, albatrosses, booby birds, and numerous species of fish. They did not find any of the trees which Captain Brooks had mentioned in his 1857 report. Later wrecks Wreckage of the SS Quartette The M/V Casitas aground on Pearl and Hermes Atoll, August 4, 2005 On December 21, 1952, the SS Quartette, a liberty ship weighing 7,198 tons, struck the eastern reef of the atoll at a speed of . The ship was driven further onto the reef by rough waves and winds, which collapsed the forward bow and damaged two forward holds. The crew was evacuated by the SS Frontenac Victory the following day. The salvage tug Ono arrived on December 25 to attempt to tow the ship clear, but persistent stormy weather forced a delay of the rescue attempt. On January 3, before another rescue attempt could be made, the ship's anchors tore loose and the Quartette was blown onto the reef. It was deemed a total loss. Several weeks later, it snapped in half at the keel and the two pieces sank. The wreck site now serves as an artificial reef which provides a habitat for many fish species. On July 2, 2005, the NOAA chartered research vessel M/V Casitas ran aground on the north end of the atoll. The ship was carrying large quantities of gasoline, diesel, and oil, which posed a substantial risk of leaking. Leak- prevention and extraction efforts led by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in conjunction with other federal and state agencies began immediately. Although several people on board were forced to evacuate the ship, there was no loss of life. The initial grounding, combined with the rescue efforts, caused extensive damage to the reef including \\"breakage of coral heads, scouring of the substrate, and injury to the reef structure itself\\". The ship was fully removed from the atoll on August 4, 2005, but was too damaged for salvage. It was towed to northwest of the Pearl and Hermes to a site approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where it was sunk over deep. Efforts to remove remaining debris and repair the reef are ongoing. Site exploration An early 19th century anchor at the Hermes shipwreck site Divers inspecting artifacts at the Pearl site In 2004, divers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) located wreckage believed to be from the Pearl during a debris removal dive. They were not able to complete a full survey at the time due to the challenging site environment. The same dive team also located the wreck site of an unknown fishing vessel during the same trip, which they nicknamed the \\"Oshima\\" site as some of the components located were similar to the Japanese \\"Oshima\\" design. Among the components located were \\"a six-cylinder Atlas Imperial diesel and machinery scatter, propeller shaft and propeller, a marine propulsion plant popular in the early decades of the 20th century.\\" Researchers theorized that the wreckage was an East Asian fishing vessel that struck the reef sometime after 1918, based on the age of the components. Maritime archaeologists from the NOAA returned to the wreck site of the Pearl in 2005 and 2006 to conduct further surveys. The 2005 survey was based on the NOAA research vessel Hi ªialakai. The same group also attempted to survey the nearby site of the Hermes, but were prevented by poor weather conditions. A number of artifacts were found at the Pearl site, including anchors, two cannons, and large try pots for rendering whale blubber. Many smaller artifacts were found actually embedded into the coral of the reef. The 2006 survey focused on completing a full site plan of the wreckage. In contrast to the scattered state of the Hermes site, the artifacts of the Pearl site are grouped roughly in the same configuration that they would have had on the intact ship, with site length being approximately the length the ship would have been. In 2008, NOAA maritime archaeologists returned to the site of the Hermes to complete the survey begun in 2005. The site was confirmed to be located about to the west of the Pearl site. A full site plan was completed, and both photographs and high definition video were made. The site contained similar artifacts to those found at the site of the Pearl, including two anchors and four cannons. At least 33 cannonballs were found, stored in linear racks, as well as stores of musket balls. Finally, some 150 iron ballast pieces were found. The extremely scattered state of the wreckage seems to confirm that the Hermes broke apart quickly and scattered with force across the sea floor. Flora and fauna Plant life 206x206px The islets of the Pearl and Hermes Atoll support thirteen native plant species and seven introduced species, including coastal grasses, vines, and herbal plants. Invasive plant species are considered a major conservation issue on the atoll, as they often out-compete and replace native species. As an example, Setaria verticillata, an undesirable noxious weed, has displaced the native grass Eragrostis variabilis on Southeast Island. An illegal landing by the military in the 1960s brought invasive field mustard seeds from Midway Atoll, which had to be removed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The flowering plant Verbesina encelioides has been identified as a major invasive threat since at least 2001. Although it provides food and nesting space for small songbirds, it poses a significant threat of entanglement to native seabirds, so removal is considered a priority for conservation purposes. Avian life Twenty percent of the world population of black-footed albatrosses breed on Pearl and Hermes The Pearl and Hermes Atoll is an important nesting area for many seabirds. Approximately 160,000 birds from 22 different species are known to live and breed on the Atoll. Tristram's storm petrels and black-footed albatrosses are among the most prominent. In 2001, it was reported that twenty percent of the world's population of black-footed albatrosses nested on Pearl and Hermes. Pearl and Hermes also hosts one of two known sites where little terns nest in Hawaii. In addition, the endangered Laysan finch was introduced to the island in 1967 to provide a backup population of these birds, should a hurricane, disease, rat introduction, or other disaster wipe out the population on the island of Laysan. Invertebrates The Pearl and Hermes Atoll provides an extensive and unique habitat for invertebrates, including various sponges and thirty- three species of stony corals. Some invasive invertebrate species have been found on the reef, including the orange-striped sea anemone, which is native to Japan, and the Christmas tree hydroid, which competes with native invertebrates for space. The atoll was once heavily populated with black-lip pearl oysters, but overfishing from 1927‚Äì1930 caused the population to crash to only 470 in 1930. An expedition in 1950 turned up only six live oysters, and another in 1969 only found one. Surveys in 1994 and 2000 also found only a few oysters, and a full analysis by the NOAA in 2003 concluded that the population has never recovered to pre-harvesting levels. Other wildlife A Hawaiian monk seal The Pearl and Hermes Atoll supports breeding populations of endangered Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. Spinner dolphins are known to mate in the area. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \\"the atoll has the highest standing stock of fish and the highest number of fish species in the NWHI\\", including sabre squirrelfish, various eels, Galapagos sharks, Sandbar sharks, giant trevally or ulua, angelfish, ƒÅweoweo or Hawaiian bigeyes, parrotfish, and various types of lobsters. Although they are rare in the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, masked angelfish and Japanese angelfish are common in the Pearl and Hermes Atoll. In 2016, scientists from the Bishop Museum, working with the NOAA, described a new species of butterflyfish found off the Pearl and Hermes Atoll, at a depth of . It was named Prognathodes basabei in honor of diver Pete Basabe, who provided support to the dives that first discovered the species. Conservation efforts Because of its small size, Pearl and Hermes Atoll has typically not been singled out for individual environmental protection; historically, it has been bundled with the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a protected region. The region was first protected in 1909 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation through , which included Pearl and Hermes Atoll. Over the next century, protection of the region increased incrementally, culminating in President George W. Bush signing Proclamation 8031 in 2006, designating the waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Threats This monster net found at Pearl and Hermes in 2014 weighed 11.5 tons Derelict fishing gear (ghost nets) and other types of marine debris have had a major impact on the reefs and associated fauna of the atoll. Pearl and Hermes Atoll is considered a high-risk entanglement zone for monk seals. Efforts have been undertaken to lessen the threat of this growing problem, including attempts at prevention as well as recurring debris removal projects. A multi-agency study was launched in 1999 to remove and catalogue debris from the water surrounding Lisianski Island and Pearl and Hermes Atoll. During this project, a total of of debris was removed from reefs and beaches around Pearl and Hermes. In 2000, the joint NOAA and NMFS Derelict Fishing Net Removal Project was launched, with the objective of removing fishing debris from the atoll and identifying any non- native species. In 2003, of marine debris was removed from the Pearl and Hermes reefs. In 2014, a net tangle weighing was located in the atoll. It was long, wide, and deep, and took three days to dismantle and remove. Rising sea level is also a major concern for the atoll due to the extremely low elevation of most of the islands. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency projects that sea level will rise by the year 2100. Southeast Island is only above sea level, and would be almost entirely submerged if sea levels rise that much. The other islets would also lose significant amounts of land area. Estimates of total land area loss range from 15% to 65% in a scenario of median sea- level rise, threatening the habitats of monk seals, sea turtles, and nesting birds. In 2016, a mysterious new red algae species known as Chondria tumulosa was spotted growing on the reefs. By 2019, it had smothered and killed large amounts of reef on the northeast section of the atoll. Analysis of the species and management techniques will be required to prevent the species from taking over other reefs on the atoll and the rest of the Northeast Hawaiian Islands. Climate Because there are no weather stations on the Pearl and Hermes Atoll, the following climate information is taken from sources for the Midway Atoll, which is approximately north-northwest of Pearl and Hermes. Like Midway, Pearl and Hermes has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen classification Aw). The atoll has no cold season. Its wet season corresponds to the high-sun months, and its dry season corresponds to the low-sun months.

The novel is composed of three parts, \\"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang,\\" \\"Shenandoah,\\" and \\"At the Still Point,\\" and is set in a post-apocalyptic era, a concept popular among authors who took part in the New Wave Science Fiction movement in the 1960s. Before the publication of Wilhelm's novel in 1976, part one of Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang was featured in the fifteenth edition of Orbit. Kate Wilhelm was a regular contributor to the Orbit anthology series, and assisted Damon Knight and other contributors with the anthology's editing. In its time, Orbit was known for publishing works of SF that differed from the mainstream of science fiction being published at the time. The title of the book is a quotation from William Shakespeare's Sonnet 73. Plot summary The novel takes place in Virginia, somewhere near the Shenandoah River, and quickly establishes its plot line in a post-apocalyptic era. The collapse of civilization around the world has resulted from massive environmental changes and global disease, which were attributed to large-scale pollution. With a range of members privileged by virtue of education and monetary resources, one large family founds an isolated community in an attempt to survive the still-developing global disasters. As the death toll rises, mainly to disease and nuclear warfare, they discover that the human population left on earth is universally infertile. From cloning experiments conducted through the study of mice, the scientists in the small community theorize that the infertility might be reversed after multiple generations of cloning, and the family begins cloning themselves in an effort to survive. The assumption is that after a few generations of cloning, the people will be able to revert to traditional biological reproduction. However, to the horror of the few surviving members of the original group, the clones who are finally coming of age reject the idea of sexual reproduction in favor of further cloning. The original members of the community, too old and outnumbered by the clones to resist, are forced to accept the new social order and the complications that arise. The new generations are cloned in groups of four to ten individuals, and due to a strong emotional and mental connection between the clones, they have a strong sense of empathy for one another. As the old generation dies out and the clones seek to expand their territory, they quickly discover that prolonged separation from other members of their group produces irreversible psychological stress. One woman, Molly, after being separated from her clones while on an expedition to find materials in the ruins of nearby cities, regains a \\"human\\" sense of individuality, which her fellow clones believe to be dangerous to the community. As a result of this, she is exiled. Though Molly is allowed to live by herself in peace, she is not allowed contact with the other clones except the members who bring her the supplies she needs. In secret, she goes on to have a child with Ben, one of the clones who accompanied her on the journey to the surrounding cities. After a few years of successful secrecy, she and the child are found, and although Molly and Ben are expelled from the community, the child, Mark, is allowed to stay. The clones, though wary of his threatening individuality, hope to study him in order to learn more about non-clones. As the child becomes a man, he realizes that his uniqueness gives him individuality and the ability to live away from the community, something which the clones are now unable to do. The leaders of the community realize that the latest generations of clones are losing all sense of creativity and are unable to come up with new solutions to problems; simultaneously they see that the growing lack of high-technology equipment will result in the community losing the ability to continue with the cloning process. As the only \\"naturally\\" produced human in the community, Mark seeks his own solution to the problem, and by force he leads a group of fertile women and children to abandon the community and start over, leaving a trail of devastation to the clone community in the wake of his departure. He returns to the community twenty years later to discover that in the wake of this disaster, the clones, unable to survive with their limited adaptability, have perished and the village has been destroyed. At novel's end, Mark returns to the community he created, where all of the children and younger generations, products of conventional reproduction, continue to thrive. The novel makes a passing reference to global cooling caused by human pollution, a prominent depiction of the future in the 1960s and 1970s:  Main characters   David  A very serious and dedicated scientist, David is a family member of the surviving colony of humans and a significant contributor to the creation of the first generation of clones, with which he has a tenuous relationship at best. He is in love with his distant cousin, Celia, and he is a donor with a batch of clones derived from his genes.  Celia  Also a family member in the original community, she is a small, but determined individual. She is a passionate person who seeks to help those suffering from the increasing global catastrophes, and assists with the development of sustainable farming methods in struggling countries. She is in love with David and is a gene donor for the production of clones.  Molly  A member of the first generation of clones and an excellent artist, she is one of a group of four who were all cloned from the same individual. She is a crew member of the first expedition to the outer cities, and suffers greatly from prolonged separation from her sisters. She is exiled to a house towards the far edges of the community and has a brief relationship with Ben. With Ben's assistance, she gives birth to Mark.  Ben  A scientist and a leader, he is also one of the original clones, along with his four brothers. He is a crew member of the first expedition, and suffers some psychological trauma from his separation from his brothers. He has a brief relationship with Molly, and is the biological father of Mark.  Barry  Also a scientist and one of Ben's brothers, he is a cautious man who resents the developed individuality of Molly, Ben, and the others who came back from the first expedition changed. Believing that the changed clones are a danger to the community, he takes a leadership position in the village after Molly and Ben are exiled.  Mark  The child of Ben and Molly, Mark is the first sexually reproduced individual in the colony who is allowed to live in the village with the clones. Separated from his mother, he is rambunctious, and a trouble maker for Barry and the other members of the community. He is isolated in the community due his individuality and intentionally causes trouble for both the clones in his peer group and the rest of the population. Eventually, he develops an escape plan and finds a community outside the village.

She is known for her distinctive sound, considered an exponent of folktronica, although it has also been described as ambient, experimental, neofolk, chill-out, indietronica, psychedelic, indie pop, and progressive folk. The daughter of tango singer Horacio Molina and actress Chunchuna Villafa√±e, she achieved fame as a sketch comedy actress in the 1990s, first as a guest in various shows and in 1991 with her own show, Juana y sus hermanas. At the height of her popularity, she quit her job as an actress to pursue a career in music. Her debut album, Rara, was subsequently released in 1996, and panned by local critics who resented her departure from television. Dejected from the criticism, she moved to Los Angeles, where her music had been better received, and she familiarized herself with electronic instruments. She then returned to Buenos Aires to produce her second album, Segundo, incorporating the sonic elements she had learned. Each one of her following albums have added a new complexity to her music, which is characterized by layered loops of acoustic and electronic sounds. Despite the initial negative reaction to her music in her home country, music critics have consistently championed Molina's body of work, praising her music and experimentation. In 2013, El Pa√≠s wrote, \\"she established herself as the star of the avant-garde sound of her country in the world.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Robin Denselow called her the \\"one-time Queen of Latin chill\\" and wrote: \\"[she] has built up a global cult following as one of the most experimental musicians in Argentina.\\" Early life Juana Molina was born to a family of artists in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 1, 1961. She is the eldest daughter of Horacio Molina, a tango singer, and Chunchuna Villafa√±e, an actress and model. She has a younger sister who has also worked as an actress and musician. The family lived in the central Buenos Aires barrio of Caballito. Her mother was a record collector, exposing her to various types of music. She began to learn to play the guitar at age 5. In 1967, Juana recorded her first song with her father, \\"Te regalo esta canci√≥n\\" (\\"I gift you this song\\"), as a gift to her mother for Mother's Day. Horacio Molina released the song as a single ‚Äîwithout his young daughter knowing‚Äîwhich sold 45 thousand copies. She also performed the song live with her father on national television. In 1976, the family left for Paris, France, due to the military dictatorship that overthrew president Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n. While in Paris, she listened to what is now known as \\"world music\\" on French radio stations. In various interviews, Molina has recalled a visit to a Spanish hippie family friend who introduced her to Indian classical music, whose drones have had an enduring influence on her music. In 1981, Molina returned to Buenos Aires. To finance her architecture studies, she had various small jobs, including an unsuccessful experience as a backing vocalist in small bands. Career As she could not make a living through music, Molina decided to find a job that paid well and did not consume much time. She decided on a career in television as the means to this end, and spent some months looking for a show that could use her services. She recorded a homemade audition tape for the studio and was offered a contract the same day. Molina began her television career in 1988 with the ATC show La noticia rebelde (\\"Rebel News\\", a word play on La novicia rebelde), where she would record one day a week and get paid for five. Her popular sketches parodied porte√±o women of various social classes. In October of the same year, Molina joined the cast of El mundo de Antonio Gasalla (\\"Antonio Gasalla's World\\"), led by comedy actor Antonio Gasalla. The show, which ran until 1990, further cemented her popularity as a sketch comedy actress and writer. The show was also performed live at the Teatro Gran Rex and in Mar del Plata. The pinnacle of her success came with her own show, Juana y sus hermanas (\\"Juana and Her Sisters\\", a wordplay on Hannah and Her Sisters), which premiered in 1991. Molina became Argentina's most popular comedian, having her show syndicated to other Latin American countries. Molina was dubbed \\"the new Nin√≠ Marshall\\" by the press, and won two Mart√≠n Fierro Awards. A compilation album of songs by Molina featured in the show was released. In 1993 Molina became pregnant with her only child, Francisca, and had to suspend her show. Reflecting on her rapid rise to stardom and distance from the music career she had always wanted, the actress decided to cancel the show in 1994. She recalls: \\"There was a moment when I imagined myself watching MTV as a decrepit old woman (like MTV would last a lifetime), thinking 'I could have done that.' I pictured myself feeling an infinite grudge, hatred, envy.\\" Produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and recorded in 1995, Molina's debut album, Rara, was released in 1996. The album was poorly marketed; Micaela Ortelli of P√°gina/12 wrote: \\"Never did an Argentine radio play a song from that album, ‚Äì too pop to be folk and too folk, perhaps, to be radio material.\\" Live shows were also problematic, as audiences expected her to act like on television. The album was better received in Los Angeles, United States, where Molina settled in 1998. Having learned how to record her music, she began to self-produce new material at the request of DreamWorks Records. Although the company ultimately did not sign her, these recordings would become Segundo, her second studio album. By 2000, she had finished recording the album and, back in Buenos Aires, she met Daniel Melero, who mixed the record. The music of Segundo was the result of Molina's new insights in timbre and her meeting with Alejandro Franov, who taught her \\"the endless sound possibilities that keyboards allow.\\" Despite remaining virtually unknown her native country, Molina's music found success in Japan, and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. American musician David Byrne bought Segundo ‚Äî intrigued by its artwork ‚Äî and quickly became and admirer of the record. He contacted Molina, and she became the opening act of his American tour.

Taxonomy and systematics  The species was first described by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1805, who named it Malimbus nigricollis. The description was based on a specimen that had been collected by Jean Perrein near Malimbe, French for the town Malembo, in the Cabinda Province of Angola. The species epithet nigricollis is a contraction of two Latin words, niger meaning \\"black\\", and collis, meaning \\"necked\\".  Subspecies  There are four subspecies recognized: * P. n. brachypterus - Swainson, 1837: Found from Senegal and Gambia to western Cameroon * P. n. nigricollis - (Vieillot, 1805): Found from eastern Cameroon to southern Sudan, western Kenya, north-western Tanzania, southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola * P. n. po - Hartert, 1907: Found on Bioko * P. n. melanoxanthus - (Cabanis, 1878): Found from southern Ethiopia and southern Somalia to central and eastern Kenya and north-eastern Tanzania  Description  The black- necked weaver is a stocky 16 cm bird with a strong conical bill. The adult male of the northern race has olive upper-parts and wings, and yellow underparts and head. It has a black eye-mask and bib, and a pale yellow iris. The non-breeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upper-parts and whitish. The wings remain yellow and black. P. n. melanoxanthus The adult female also has olive upper-parts and wings, and yellow underparts and head. It has a black eyemask but no bib. The southern race found from Nigeria eastwards has a quite different appearance, with almost black upper-parts and tail. The black-necked weaver feeds on insects and vegetable matter. The calls of this bird include a wheezing dew-dew-twee . Distribution and habitat This weaver occurs in forests, especially in wet habitats. Behaviour and ecology It builds a large coarsely woven nest made of grass and creepers with a 15 cm downward facing entrance tunnel hanging from the globular egg chamber. The nest is suspended from a branch in a tree and 2-3 eggs are laid. It nests in pairs but forms small flocks when not breeding.

It often includes times of intense study, prayer, living in community, studying the vowed life, deepening one's relationship with God, and deepening one's self-awareness. The canonical time of the novitiate is one year; in case of additional length, it must not be extended over two years.Codex iuris canonici 648 In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the novitiate is officially set at three years before one may be tonsured a monk or nun, though this requirement may be waived. The novitiate is in any case a time both for the novice to get to know the community and the community to get to know the novice. The novice should aspire to deepening his or her relationship to God and discovering the community's charism. The novitiate in many communities includes a concentrated program of prayer, study, reflection and limited ministerial engagement. > The novitiate, through which life in an institute is begun, is arranged so > that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one > which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the > institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their > intention and suitability are tested. :‚ÄîCodex Iuris Canonici (1983), can. > 646 In some novitiate communities, mostly monastic, the novice often wears clothing that is distinct from secular dress but is not the full habit worn by professed members of the community. The novices' day normally includes participation in the canonical hours, manual labor, and classes about the religious life they are preparing to commit themselves to. Spiritual exercises and tests of humility are common features of a novitiate. A superior should ideally appoint an experienced member of the community to serve as novice master or mistress. Different religious communities have varying requirements for the duration of the novitiate. The novice must complete a postulancy before being admitted to the novitiate, the duration of which can be short or extend up to three years. A novice is free to leave the novitiate at any time, and in most communities, the superiors are free to dismiss him or her with or without cause. At the end of the novitiate, the novices are either admitted to vows or asked to leave. The term \\"novitiate\\" also refers to the building, house, or complex devoted to the novices' needs.

The eruptions occur every 51‚ÅÑ2 to 7 hours. As is Old Faithful, Riverside is one of the most predictable geysers in the park, because it is not located near any other geysers that may disrupt the flow of underground water in the geyser's plumbing. Riverside is unique in its way that eruptions seldom occur at the average interval for any given time. Instead, Riverside is bimodal, meaning it usually erupts 20 minutes before or 25 minutes late for a duration of 20 minutes.

Additionally, it can be an animal, especially a racehorse, that has not yet won a major prize or reached a level of performance to qualify for important events. Religion Buddhism Buddhist novices in Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Bhutan In many Buddhist orders, a man or woman who intends to take ordination must first become a novice, adopting part of the monastic code indicated in the vinaya and studying in preparation for full ordination. The name for this level of ordination varies from one tradition to another. In Pali, the word is samanera, which means 'small monk' or 'boy monk'. Christianity =Catholicism= A novice is at left. The habit of a novice often differs from that of the full professed sisters. A novice in Catholic canon law and tradition, is a prospective member of a religious order who is being tried and being proven for suitability of admission to a religious order of priests, religious brothers, or religious sisters, whether the community is one of monks or has an \\"active\\" ministry. After initial contact with the community, and usually a period of time as a postulant (a more or less formal period of candidacy for the novitiate), the person will be received as a novice in a ceremony that most often involves being clothed with the religious habit (traditional garb) of the particular religious community. The novice's habit is often slightly different from those of professed members of the order. For instance, in communities of women that wear a dark veil over the head, novices often wear a white one; among Franciscan communities of men, novices wear an additional shirt-like chest piece over the traditional Franciscan robe; Carthusian novices wear a dark cloak over the usual white habit; etc. Novices are not admitted to vows until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the novitiate. This usually lasts one year, the minimum required by Canon Law, though in some orders and communities it is two. Novices typically have dormitories in separate areas within a monastery or community and are under the direct supervision of a novice master or novice mistress. =Eastern Orthodox Church= In the Orthodox Church, a candidate may be clothed as a novice (Slavonic: –ø–æ—Å–ª—É—à–Ω–∏–∫, poslushnik, literally \\"one under obedience\\") by the hegumen (abbot) or hegumenia (abbess) after at least three days in the monastery. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) is simply given the riassa, belt and skoufos. Novice nuns additionally wear a veil (apostolnik) that covers the head and neck. A novice is also given a prayer rope and instructed in the use of the Jesus Prayer. In large communities, the new novice may be assigned a starets (spiritual father or spiritual mother) who will guide his (or her) spiritual development. Frequent confession of sins and participation in the sacred mysteries (sacraments) of the church is an important part of Orthodox monastic life. A novice is free to leave the monastery at any time, and the superior is free to dismiss the novice at any time if, for instance, they feel that the novice is not called to monasticism, or if there have been issues of discipline. If, however, the novice perseveres, after a period of around three years the hegumen may choose to clothe them in the first (beginning) rank of monasticism: the rassaphore. Sports In National Hunt racing, a novice is a horse that has not won a race under a particular code (either chasing or hurdling) before the current season. In figure skating competitions, novice has two meanings. For the U.S. Figure Skating Association, it refers to a skill level, while the International Skating Union uses it to designate age. Novice is a level of minor hockey in Canada. Novice players are usually between the ages of 7 and 8. In the sport of crew (rowing), the term is used for an athlete in their first year of competition. In many sports, a novice athlete competing in their first season or league is often referred to as a rookie, and outstanding novice athletes can win Rookie of the Year. Online communities With the rise of the internet, a novice is a person who is a newcomer to a particular website, forum, or other social community. These people are usually inexperienced and unfamiliar with the traditions and protocols surrounding that community, and often tend not to contribute.In a study at Carnegie Mellon University, researchers looked at whether reminding users of their history of rating rarely-rated movies at MovieLens.com increased their contributions. The study found that reminding users of their uniqueness increased their willingness to contribute. The study also looked at whether goal-setting could help users contribute more to the community. The study found that users with specific goals contributed more than users with a do-your-best goal. Generally derogatory slang terms include \\"newbie\\" and the more derogatory \\"noob\\". Newbie is mostly used as a descriptor or qualifier, a name given to novices by more experienced users or community members to indicate someone who just entered the community and is eager to learn and participate. Noob is a word used to insult or deride novices who are disrespectful, uninterested, or unwilling to learn. In gamer culture, a newbie is an inexperienced player with a low level, rank, or in-game abilities but wants to participate and improve, and a noob is a bad player who seems disinterested in learning or teamwork and trolls other players.  Dealing With newcomers  Online communities have five basic problems regarding newcomers: recruitment, selection, retention, socialization, and protection.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012). Dealing with Newcomers. p. 2. Recruitment in online communities is about advertising to recruits and ensuring there is a healthy amount of newcomers because without newcomers, online communities can fail to survive. There many different methods that online communities use to recruit new members. For example, Blizzard entertainment used both impersonal advertisement (TV, print, online advertisement) and interpersonal advertisement (recruit-a-friend promotion) to recruit new players for World of Warcraft.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012). Dealing with Newcomers. p. 4. Selection in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers will be a good fit in the community. This is very important because a better fit is more likely to be beneficial for the community, since better fit newcomers stay in the group longer when they join and are more satisfied with their membership. One way that selection works in online communities is through the process of self- selection, in which the potential members decide themselves to join a community based on the information about the community available to them. Another way of selection is through screening, in which the community selects certain members who they believe will be a good fit.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012). Dealing with Newcomers. p. 13 Retention in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers stick around and stay long enough to become more committed members, who take on more important responsibilities and begin to be identify themselves with the group. One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment. For example, in World of Warcraft, newcomers have to play with other guild members for at least about a month to join.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012). Dealing with Newcomers. p. 22 Socialization in online communities about the rest of community interacting with newcomer and teaching them the guidelines and standards of the community. For example, in World of Warcraft, old member show the newcomers ropes, by coaching them, helping them with quests, and providing mentorship in general.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012). Dealing with Newcomers. p. 27 Protection in online communities is about protecting the community from the newcomers. Since newcomers still have not established themselves with the group or still may be unfamiliar with the norms of the community, the rest of the community has to beware of the potential damage that they can cause. One way to deal with the threats is through the use of sandboxes, which allows newcomers to try out the features and learn about the tools without causing damage to the community.Robert Kraut, Moira Burke & John Riedl (2012).

The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The governor has a duty to enforce local laws, to convene the Legislative Assembly, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly, to appoint government officers, to appoint justices, and to grant pardons. Since 1948, the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico. Prior to that, the governor was appointed either by the king of Spain (1510-1898) or the president of the United States (1898‚Äì1948). Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers them with the faculty to appoint officers. Law No. 104 of 1956 empowers them with the faculty to delegate functions. These two faculties in conjunction allow the governor to delegate most of their functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government. Most of the governor's functions are delegated to the chief of staff, who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies. The budget is delegated to the director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the president of the Planning Board. This effectively makes the governor a political figure rather than an administrative one, allowing them to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day-to-day operations. Historically, however, governors tend to be heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of the government in both internal and external affairs. History The first known and recorded heads of government in the history of Puerto Rico were the caciques, the tribal chiefs of the natives known as Ta√≠nos that inhabited the island before the arrival of Spaniards. It is believed that the cacique rank was apparently established through democratic means. His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills, since the Ta√≠nos were mostly a pacifist culture. Ag√ºeyban√° I is the most-well known cacique as he was the one governing all others when the Spaniards arrived in 1493 although many others existed during his period, as well as before and after him.  Spanish colonial era  When the Spanish Empire colonized Puerto Rico during the 16th century, the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le√≥n established himself as the island's first governor. Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n had been appointed to take the position of Captain General of the City of Puerto Rico prior to the island's colonization, but he never performed this function. As part of the Spanish Empire, the Spanish monarchy was in charge of appointing the governor of Puerto Rico. The person selected was in charge of the island's development and wealth and was responsible for reporting the colony's status to the government in Spain. The first native Puerto Rican to perform the function was Juan Ponce de Le√≥n II, grandson of the conquistador, who served as interim governor in 1579. After 1580 Puerto Rico's government was established as the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico, and subsequent governors held the office of Captain General as well.  As a United States territory and commonwealth  On July 25, 1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States. Following the conclusion of the war, Spain was forced to cede Puerto Rico, along with Cuba, the Philippines and Guam, to the United States under the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico began the twentieth century under the military rule of the United States with officials, including the governor, who were appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, William McKinley signed the Foraker Act as a United States federal law, which established civilian (limited popular) government on Puerto Rico. The new government had a governor and an executive council appointed by the President, a House of Representatives with 35 elected members, a judicial system with a Supreme Court, and a non-voting Resident Commissioner in Congress. The first civilian governor of the island under the Foraker Act was Charles Herbert Allen. This system was still used after the approval of the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act, which altered the structure of government in Puerto Rico, and was in use until 1948. Following the approval of the federal Elective Governor Act by President Harry S Truman in 1947, the governor has been elected through a democratic process every four years since 1948. At that time, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n became the first democratically elected governor. The current governmental structure was established under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, ratified in 1952. Sitting governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n was re-elected as the first governor under the Constitution. Under Article IV of the Constitution, the governor continues to be popularly elected every four years and is the head of the Commonwealth's executive branch. The governor-elect takes office on January 2 of the following year in a public inaugural ceremony which may be preceded by a private oath-taking ceremony. Powers The governor is head of the government of Puerto Rico. They have the power to veto any number of projects that the Puerto Rican Legislature wishes to pass. The governor also has the power to appoint the members of their cabinet, who in turn must be ratified by the Legislature. The governor also has the power to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court and all the lower courts of the island. The governor must address the legislature at the beginning of each year to present two speeches, one is the State of the Commonwealth speech and another in which the governor presents the \\"Recommended Budget\\" for the next fiscal year, in which the governor proposes to the state legislature a budget for the consideration of said body. They are also the commander-in-chief of the Puerto Rico National Guard and the chief diplomat. La Fortaleza is the oldest governor's mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere Eligibility On July 25, 1952, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was enacted by Governor Mu√±oz Mar√≠n after the approval by Congress and the President of the United States. Pursuant to section Three, Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico, the governor must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Puerto Rico for five consecutive years prior and at least 35 years old at the time of the election. The governor serves a four- year term which begins on the second day of January after the year of their election and ends on the date their successor takes office. Consecutive service is unlimited, according to the Constitution of the Island. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, its first elected governor, served for four consecutive terms from 1949 to 1965, but almost all subsequent governors served either one or two terms; the Constitution of the Commonwealth was ratified by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952. Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, however, served three non-consecutive terms: first from 1973 to 1977, and then from 1985 to 1993. Elections The governor is elected by a direct vote from the people. Candidates typically represent a political party, with every elected governor to date () having been a member of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico or the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico. Only a plurality vote (more than any other candidate) is required to win election, rather than a majority (more than half the votes). The Puerto Rico Elections Code states that if the margin of victory of a candidate is less than 0.5% of the votes, a full recount of the election must take place. So far, only in the gubernatorial elections of 1980 and 2004 has a recount taken place. Succession Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office (by impeachment and conviction) of a sitting governor, the secretary of state would then take the office of governor until the end of the four-year term. In case the secretary of state is unwilling or unable to assume it, the secretary of justice would assume the governorship, followed by the secretary of treasury, the secretary of education, the secretary of labor and human resources, the secretary of transportation and public works, the secretary of economic development and commerce, the secretary of health and the secretary of agriculture. If none of them is available for succession the Legislative Assembly meets to elect by majority vote of all of its members a governor for the rest of the term. Other provisions exist for the transition between an incumbent governor and a governor-elect. Similar to some U.S. states, such as California, if the governor is temporarily away from Puerto Rico, the secretary of state, or in their absence the highest ranking Cabinet member in the line of succession, becomes acting governor until the governor's return. In decades past, when off-island gubernatorial travel was infrequent, the powers of the governorship rarely devolved upon the secretary of state or other Cabinet officers. More accessible travel has made the acting governorship a much more common occurrence. During recent times, not only has the secretary of state frequently served as acting governor, but the secretary of justice, and secretary of treasury have as well. 2019 leadership crisis On July 24, 2019, Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ announced his resignation after two weeks of protests in Puerto Rico related to Telegramgate. He became the first elected governor to resign the post. His resignation took effect on August 2, 2019 at 5 pm. Before leaving office, Rossell√≥ nominated Pedro Pierluisi as secretary of state, intending to make Pierluisi his successor, but his nomination was not approved by the full legislature before Rossell√≥'s resignation took effect. Despite not having been confirmed by the Senate of Puerto Rico, Pierluisi was sworn in as governor, which prompted a legal challenge. Less than a week later, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico declared that Pierluisi had taken office on unconstitutional grounds and removed him from office, effective 5 p.m. AST on August 7. At that time, the current secretary of justice, Wanda V√°zquez Garced, became governor following the original line of succession as it was on August 2 at 5 pm.

(publ. Delacorte Press) The Choirboys (), a novel, is a controversial 1975 work of fiction written by Los Angeles Police Department officer-turned- novelist Joseph Wambaugh. In 1995 the novel was selected by the Mystery Writers of America as Number 93 of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time. The Choirboys is a tragicomic parody about the effects of urban police work on young officers, seen through the exploits of a group of Los Angeles police officers in the Wilshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department while an investigation is being conducted into an alleged shooting that took place in Macarthur Park, a frequent hangout of the group. A group of ten patrol officers on the nightwatch conducts end-of-shift get-togethers they euphemistically call \\"choir practices\\" (possibly to hide their true nature from superiors but actually a sardonic reference). These \\"choir practices\\" almost always involve heavy drinking, complaints about their superior officers, and war stories (and, occasionally, group sex with a pair of lusty, overweight barmaids). They hold the choir practices in MacArthur Park because it is in another division's territory and \\"one does not shit in one's own nest.\\" Each of the officers is disillusioned, to varying degrees, that many of the people they're paid to protect are not unlike the suspects they arrest, and that the ridiculous regulations of their department are onerously enforced on them while their commanders (without skills in police work) indulge themselves hypocritically. Wambaugh's portrayals of the ten officers are archetypes of varied personalities found in police departments in the 1970s, albeit well-drawn, but his most cutting descriptions are saved for the brutal \\"black-glove officer,\\" Roscoe Rules. The theme of police officer suicide (also known as \\"eating your gun\\"), which runs through many of Wambaugh's books, provides a grim undercurrent to the black humor of the novel and suggests a sub-conscious motivation for their activities. Due to the popularity of the book, the slang term \\"choir practice\\" became a somewhat popular euphemism for off-duty recreational activities even if it does not involve alcohol. The Choirboys is considered an indictment of the LAPD hierarchy in several ways: the choirboys' dislike and distrust of command-level officers; the way the investigation into the shooting was handled; and many of their superiors' apathetic attitudes about the pressures officers have to deal with. Wambaugh, however, summarized the conduct of the choirboys both on and off-duty by having Sgt. Yanov, their field supervisor, comment to his superior at the conclusion: \\"They weren't troublemakers...they were just policemen. Rather ordinary young guys. Maybe a little lonelier than some. Or scared.\\" Wambaugh's previous LAPD novels, The New Centurions and The Blue Knight, had been conventional and straightforward portrayals of his experiences. With The Choirboys he \\"found his voice,\\" and thereafter his novels were stylistic lampoons of not only the Los Angeles police world but the Hollywood lifestyle, and often filled with black comedy. Wambaugh, by then a successful author, resigned from the LAPD after fourteen years of service in order to publish The Choirboys without retribution from those he burlesqued. The Choirboys is also significant in that Wambaugh turned to the bizarre anecdotes of others (which he terms \\"cop talk\\") to provide the grist for his writing after previously drawing from his own experience.  The Choirboys  The nightwatch radio cars of Wilshire Station: 7-A-1: Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate At age 52, Herbert \\"Spermwhale\\" Whalen is the oldest and, legitimately, the toughest of the choirboys. However, unlike Roscoe Rules, he isn't \\"an insufferable prick,\\" although he has the same contempt for most \\"civilians, police brass and station supervisors, and all members of the Civil Service Department.\\" A nineteen-year veteran, Whalen considers anyone with less tenure a rookie. Whalen was a transport pilot in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He attained the rank of major as a reservist in the Air Force. Whalen is the only choirboy who never attended college. He carries a cropped mugshot of his dead son because it's the last photo taken of him before he died. He's been married three times and says he respects the second one the most because she had the most fortitude to take him for nearly everything he owned. Baxter Slate, almost 27, is a handsome cynic with a baccalaureate in classical literature, which he considers worthless; can tell dirty jokes in Latin; and amuses himself by confounding Roscoe Rules with his advanced vocabulary. Outwardly, Slate appears to be the most stable of the officers, but he is tormented by inner demons, particularly emotional scars from working child abuse cases, and is driven to suicide because of his shame in inadvertently being caught by Sam Niles in a humiliating encounter with a dominatrix. 7-A-29: Sam Niles and Harold Bloomguard Sam Niles and Harold Bloomguard, both 26, are, like many police officers of the era, Vietnam veterans, former Marines who were trapped together in a North Vietnamese Army cave during their tour. Harold found a father figure in Sam and followed him into the LAPD, where both obtained college degrees in their off-duty time. On the surface Niles is the dominant of the two. From a background of poverty and abuse, Niles is uncomfortable with all relationships, hastily marrying a coed. They were divorced as quickly. Although he tolerates his partner, he also fears him because Harold knows his innermost shame and secret, the helpless weakness he once showed in the cave. Bloomguard is the opposite. He's a physical and emotional weakling who attached himself to Sam Niles and dotes on his partner. While Niles had no difficulty meeting all the police selection requirements, Bloomguard, who barely met the height requirement, gorged himself on high- calorie food for three days just to meet the weight requirement. Bloomguard is a protector of the ducks at MacArthur Park and other small and meek animals. Due to his Vietnam experience, Niles developed severe claustrophobia, which becomes a key factor in the MacArthur Park shooting. Harold Bloomguard was the \\"driving force behind the inception of the MacArthur Park choir practice.\\" 7-A-33: Spencer Van Moot and Willie Wright  At 40, Spencer Van Moot is the second-oldest of the Choirboys and their \\"great provider\\", taking the fullest advantage of free meals, cigarettes, and other gratuities offered to uniformed officers by businesses within the division's jurisdiction. He is also a connoisseur of food and fashion and spends much of the time at choir practices complaining about his failing third marriage. \\"Father\\" Willie Wright is a short, chubby 24-year-old officer. A converted and thoroughly devout Jehovah's Witness, Father Willie is, like his partner, in an unhappy marriage, but in his case, his unhappiness is due primary to an obsessively religious wife who would rather distribute Watchtower magazines door-to-door on his days off than have sex with him. Wright joined the Choirboys out of loneliness and frustration. His guilt-driven, drunken sermons over the evils of drink and marital infidelity, despite the fact that he frequently engaged in both, earned him the moniker \\"Father\\" Willie Wright. 7-A-77: Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi Calvin Potts, 28, is a recently divorced black officer and an alcoholic like the rest of his middle-class Baldwin Hills family. His ex-wife's father is one of Los Angeles' top black attorneys who convinced the divorce judge to order Potts to pay nearly half of his salary in alimony and child support, so that Potts now rides an old Schwinn bicycle to work. Francis Tanaguchi, 25, is a third-generation Japanese-American who was raised in the barrios of Los Angeles, and \\"unquestionably, the biggest pain in the ass on the nightwatch at Wilshire Station\\". He believes, at heart, that he's more Hispanic than Asian and goes to great lengths to de-emphasize his Japanese ancestry. Francis is also an inveterate practical joker, once pretending to be a vampire for three weeks and suspected of being behind the anonymous sultry female voice nicknamed \\"The Dragon Lady\\" who makes anonymous phone calls to the homes of the choirboys in the middle of the night. Potts and Tanaguchi are collectively referred to as \\"The Gook and The Spook.\\" 7-A-85: Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt  Henry \\"Roscoe\\" Rules, 29, is a five-year veteran of the LAPD. He is brutal and mean, a bully. He was nicknamed \\"Roscoe\\" during a choir practice when he referred to his police-issue .38 special as a \\"roscoe\\" after watching a Humphrey Bogart movie on television. Of all the officers, he is the one most intent on proving he is the toughest cop on the force and refers to people he dislikes (which is just about everyone) as \\"scrotes\\" (short for scrotums). The word was coined by Father Willie Wright for Roscoe to use in reference to people since Rules felt that the word \\"asshole\\" was overused in police work, and the word scrotum too long. Of the word \\"scrote\\" as used by Roscoe Rules, Baxter Slate quips that it is \\"a philosophy in a word\\". Rules hates the city and lives on a \\"ranch\\" sixty miles from it, \\"east of Chino\\". To describe just how mean Roscoe Rules is, fellow officers created an inside joke that Roscoe Rules \\"handed out towels in the showers at Auschwitz\\". Dean \\"Whaddayamean Dean\\" Pratt, 25, is a bachelor who fears Roscoe and kowtows to his every impulse. Pratt is notorious for being unable to tolerate even moderate amounts of alcohol. When inebriated, Dean is incapable of holding even the simplest of conversations. \\"Any question, statement, piece of smalltalk would be met by an idiotic frustrating maddening double beseechment: \\"I don't get it. I don't get it.\\" Or, \\"Whaddaya trying to say? Whaddaya trying to say?\\" Or, most frequently heard, \\"Whaddaya mean? Whaddaya mean?\\"\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1977, The Choirboys was adapted into a film starring Charles Durning, Perry King, James Woods, Louis Gossett, Jr. and Randy Quaid. Ultimately the film was unsuccessful and critically panned. The entire ending was changed for the film, and critics complained that while the book showed the police officers as sympathetic characters, the film painted them as a bunch of drunken jerks. Wambaugh himself refused to have his name associated with the film, as he considered it to be an extremely poor interpretation of his novel. For this reason he is uncredited. Several characters had their names changed from what they had been in the novel: Sam Niles - Sam Lyles, Calvin Potts - Calvin Motts, Willie Wright - \\"Father\\" Sartino, Dean Pratt - Dean Proust. 1975 American novels Novels by Joseph Wambaugh Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Novels set in Los Angeles American novels adapted into films Delacorte Press books ","title":"The Choirboys (novel)"},{"id":"708725","text":"Michael Stewart (August 1, 1924 ‚Äì September 20, 1987) was an American playwright and librettist for the stage.

The adjacent village of Buttermere takes its name from the lake. Historically in Cumberland, the lake is now within the county of Cumbria. Owned by the National Trust, it forms part of its Buttermere and Ennerdale property. Geography The lake is long by wide, and is deep. It has an elevation above sea level of . It is situated towards the head of the valley of the River Cocker and is surrounded by fells, notably the High Stile range to the south west, Robinson to the north-east, Fleetwith Pike and Haystacks to the south- east and Grasmoor to the north-west. The village of Buttermere stands at the north-western end of the lake, and beyond this is Crummock Water. There is a path around the lake which is about long, and at one point runs through a rock tunnel beneath the locality of Hassness. Access is by road, from Cockermouth in the north-west; from Borrowdale via the Honister Pass; or from Braithwaite and the Newlands Valley via Newlands Hause. Etymology There are two possible origins for the name \\"Buttermere\\": One, that Buttermere means \\"the lake by the dairy pastures\\" (from the Old English \\"butere mere\\"). Whaley suggests this as the correct interpretation: \\" 'butter lake, the lake with good pasture-land', from OE 'butere' 'butter', conveying the fertile nature of the flat alluvial land at both ends of the lake, plus 'mere' 'lake',...\\" Two, that it is the corrupt form of a personal name. Robert Ferguson asserts in his 1866 work, \\"The Northmen in Cumberland and Westmoreland\\" that Buttermere derives from the Old Norse personal name \\"Buthar\\", as in \\"Buthar's mere\\" (lake). This accords with local tradition, which says that the valley of Buttermere was part of the holdings of an 11th-century Norse chieftain called \\"Buthar\\" (sometimes spelt \\"Boethar\\"). Large numbers of Vikings settled in the Cumbrian area during the 9th and 10th centuries and many names in the area are of Norse origin: streams are termed 'becks', from the Old Norse bekkr; mountains are 'fells', from the Norse fjall; waterfalls are forces, from fos; ravines are 'gills'; valleys are 'dales', from dalr (ON); and small lakes are termed 'tarns', which derives from tjorn, meaning teardrop. Whaley suggests that the personal name interpretation is incorrect, but notes that the Victoria County History \\"deemed it 'not disputed that the family of the Scotic ruler, Bueth or Boet, held its own against the Norman intruder', with possession of the barony of Gillesland, for fifty years after the Norman Conquest.\\" See article on Buttermere at the English Lakes.com website. History From his hidden stronghold at Buttermere, it is said that Jarl Buthar conducted a campaign of running resistance against the Norman invaders, from the time of William the Conqueror's Harrying of the North in 1069 right up until the early 12th century. In 1072 King William set up a garrison at Carlisle, but the isolated garrison needed constant reinforcement and supplies. It is claimed that the Cumbrians fought a guerrilla war against the Normans for almost half a century, attacking supply wagons, ambushing patrols and inflicting great losses upon them in terms of money, material and men. The extent to which Jarl Buthar is a semi-mythological figure is unclear. He is apparently mentioned in 12th century Norman documents, but much of his story appears to be based on local legend and archaeology, later enhanced by Nicholas Size's popular dramatised history (see below). Jarl Boethar's campaign and a final battle at Rannerdale (c.f. Ferguson, \\"Ragnar's dale\\") between the Normans and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cumbrians led by the Jarl is the subject of a dramatised history by Nicholas Size, called \\"The Secret Valley: The Real Romance of Unconquered Lakeland\\" (pub. 1930) Rosemary Sutcliff's YA novel \\"Shield Ring\\" (pub. 1956) imagines the lives of Jarl Buthar and his band of Cumbrian rebels, and their last stand against the forces of a Norman army under the command of Ranulf le Meschin, Lord of Carlisle and later Earl of Chester, nearly 50 years after the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. It was clearly inspired by Nicholas Size's history, which it closely follows. Mary Robinson (1778‚Äì1837), known as the \\"Maid of Buttermere\\" and the subject of Melvyn Bragg's novel of that name, was the daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn in Buttermere village.

He is best known for his romanticising depictions of rural scenes, and for creating Mulready stationery letter sheets, issued at the same time as the Penny Black postage stamp. Life and family William Mulready was born in Ennis, County Clare. Early in his life, in 1792, the family moved to London, where he was able to get an education and was taught painting well enough so that he was accepted at the Royal Academy School at the age of fourteen. Choosing the Wedding Gown illustrating chapter 1 of Vicar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith In 1802, he married Elizabeth Varley (1784‚Äì1864), a landscape painter. She came from a family of established artists; her brothers included John Varley, friend of William Blake, Cornelius Varley, and William Fleetwood Varley. Their three children, Paul Augustus (1805‚Äì1864), William (1805‚Äì1878), and Michael (1807‚Äì1889) also became artists. His relationship with his wife however deteriorated gradually over the years, which is detailed in papers stored at the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His strong Catholic beliefs prevented any chance of a divorce but they separated. He accused her of \\"bad conduct\\" but shied from providing details. In a letter to him in 1827 she blamed him entirely for the collapse of their marriage, suggesting cruelty, pederastic activities and adultery were the reasons,Brian Reade, Sexual Heretics, London, 1970. p. 16 writing that one of his pupils, Harriet Gouldsmith, had told her Malready \\"preferred her little finger\\" to his wife and children, and accusing him having \\"had taken a low boy to your bed, and turned one adrift at midnight, to seek one at the house of an unmarried man.\\"A Family HistoryClairmont, Clara Mary Jane; Stocking, Marion Kingston The Clairmont correspondence: letters of Claire Clairmont, Charles Clairmont, and Fanny Imlay Godwin, Volume 1, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995, p4. His son, William Mulready Junior (1805‚Äì1878), lived in London and maintained a career of a portrait painter and picture restorer. He had five children (Ellen, Mary, Augustus Edwin, Henry William, and JohnCensuses 1861, 1871, 1881). They also were trained as artists, but not all of them pursued the artistic career: Henry William and John described themselves as 'house painters'. Augustus Edwin Mulready (1844‚Äì1904) was the most successful of them and became known as a member of the Cranbrook Colony of artists. Artistic career The Sonnet: 1839 Mulready oil painting in V&A; CollectionMany of his early pictures show landscapes, before he started to build a reputation as a genre painter from 1808 on, painting mostly everyday scenes from rural life. He also illustrated children's books including the first edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare in 1807; William Roscoe's entertaining poem The Butterfly's Ball, and the Grasshopper's Feast in the same year; and a sequel to the latter by Catherine Ann Dorset. Some of these were for the Juvenile Library of William Godwin and Mary Jane Clairmont; Godwin in turn wrote, under a pseudonym, an account of Mulready's early life, suitable for children. This painting by Mulready portrays the African-American actor Ira Aldridge, known in Europe for his Shakespearean roles, including Othello, Lear, and Macbeth. The Walters Art Museum.Mulready's paintings were popular in Victorian times. His first painting of importance, Returning from the Ale House, now in the Tate Gallery, London, under the title Fair Time, appeared in 1809. In 1815 he became an Associate of the Royal Academy (A.R.A.) and R.A. in 1816.Melville, Fred J, Postage Stamps in the Making, p71, Stanley Gibbons, 1916. In the same year, he also was awarded the French \\"L√©gion d'honneur\\". Mulready's most important pictures are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the Tate Gallery. In the former are 33, among them Hampstead Heath (1806); Giving a Bite (1836); First Love (1839); The Sonnet (1839); Choosing the Wedding Gown (1846); and The Butt (Shooting a Cherry) (1848). In the latter are five, including a Snow Scene. In the National Gallery, Dublin, are Young Brother and The Toy Seller. His Wolf and the Lamb is in Royal possession. In 1840, Mulready designed the illustrations for the postal stationery, known as Mulready stationery were introduced by the Royal Mail at the same time as the Penny Black in May 1840. They were issued in two forms; one variant was precut to a diamond or lozenge shape and folded to form an envelope that could be held together by seal at the apex of the topmost flap; and lettersheets that were cut in rectangles, folded over and sealed or tucked in. Stationery manufacturers, whose livelihood was threatened by the new lettersheet, produced many caricatures (or lampoons) of Mulready's design. Only six days after their introduction, on May 12, Rowland Hill wrote that; I fear we shall have to substitute some other stamp for that design by Mulready ... the public have shown their disregard and even distaste for beauty, and within two months a decision had been made to replace the Mulready designed stationery. Essentially Mulready's designs were a folly. Death Funerary monument, Kensal Green Cemetery, London He died at the age of 77 in Bayswater, London and is buried in the nearby Kensal Green Cemetery where a monument to his memory was erected. The monument lies on the north side of the main path, midway between the entrance and the main chapel, and although not in the front line of graves it is easily spotted due to its unique form. The tomb was designed by Godfrey Sykes.

Masters of the vast plateaux of Najd, they enjoyed a somewhat infamous reputation, possibly owing to their relatively late (for the Arabian tribes) conversion to Islam and accounts of their campaigns in the borderlands between Iraq and Syria. With the revolutionary movement of the Qarmatians in Bahrain and Oman, they participated in the pillage of Mecca in 930 in their fight against the Fatimid Caliphate. When the latter became masters of Egypt and the founders of Cairo in 969, they hastened to confine the unruly Bedouin in the south before sending them to Central North Africa (Libya, Tunisia and Algeria).  Origin  According to Ibn Khaldun, the Banu Hilal were accompanied by their wives and their children when they came to the Maghreb. They settled in Tunisia after winning some battles against some Berber tribes, eventually going on to coexist with them. Patrilineal genealogy table Ibn Khaldun described their genealogy, which consisted of two mother tribes: themselves and the Banu Sulaym. In Arabia, they lived on the Ghazwan near Ta'if while the Banu Sulaym attended nearby Medina, sharing a common cousin in the Al Yas branch of the Quraysh. At the time of their migration, Banu Hilal comprised six families: Athbadj, Riyah, Jochem, Addi, Zughba, and Rbia.  History  From the Arabian Peninsula, they first migrated to the south of Egypt before heading to the central North Africa. Abu Zayd al-Hilali led between 150,000 and 300,000 Arabs into central North Africa, who assimilated and intermarried with the indigenous peoples. The Fatimids used the tribe, which began their journey as allies and vassals, to punish the particularly difficult to control Zirids after the conquest of Egypt and the founding of Cairo. As the dynasty became increasingly independent and abandoned Shia Islam, they quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadid dynasty and the Zenata. Their influx was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural Arabization of the Maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant.The Great Mosque of Tlemcen, MuslimHeritage.com Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.Populations Crises and Population Cycles , Claire Russell and W. M. S. Russell The Banu Hilal later came under the rule of various subsequent Berber dynasties, including the Almohad Caliphate, Hafsid dynasty, Zayyanid dynasty and Marinid dynasty. Finding their continued presence intolerable, the Almohad Caliphate defeated the Banu Hilal and forced many of them to leave Tunisia and settle in Morocco. Upon the arrival of the Turks, the Banu Hilaleen rose against the Ottoman Empire alongside Berbers in the Aur√®s region and south of Algeria.  Social organization  Originally, the Banu Hilal embraced a nomadic lifestyle, rearing cattle and sheep. Despite several tribes living in arid and desert areas, they became experts in the field of agriculture. The Hilaleen do not embrace any specific ideology and are not very conservative, though the majority of the population does embrace Islam. Initially Shia, after their conquest of the Sunni Maghreb majority of Banu Hilal converted to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam. Other tribes Arabized the Berbers to a considerable extent in Algeria, where intermarriage occurred frequently during their shared history.  Taghribat Banu Hilal  The accounts and records that the folk poet Abdul Rahman al-Abnudi gathered from the bards of Upper Egypt culminated in the Taghribat Bani Hilal, an Arab epic describing the journey of the tribe from Arabia to the Maghreb. The tale is divided into three main cycles. The first two bring together unfolding events in Arabia and other countries of the east, while the third, called Taghriba (march west), recounts the migration of the Banu Hilal to North Africa.Musique et spectacle: Le th√©√¢tre lyrique arabe - Esquisse d'un itin√©raire...

He was promoted to CEO in March 2002, while retaining the title of president, and named chairman effective January 1, 2003. Palmisano announced on October 25, 2011, that he was stepping aside as president and CEO. He was succeeded in these positions by Ginni Rometty. As of 2009, IBM was the largest IT company in the world and 45th largest company overall.Forbes International Business Machines 2009 Snapshot. Education and personal life Palmisano grew up in an Italian-American middle class family in Baltimore, Maryland. His father owned a body shop.http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a- super-second-act/ As an offensive lineman at Calvert Hall College High School in Baltimore, Maryland he prepared earnestly, studying pregame scouting reports and seldom missed a blocking assignment. He was also a union musician, and once was the opening act and played backup saxophone for The Temptations. He holds a bachelor's degree in history from Johns Hopkins University where he was member of Beta Theta Pi. He also played football (center, offensive tackle, team co-captain) there, and turned down an opportunity to try out with the Oakland Raiders. He met his wife, Gaier Notman, a 1969 alumna of Miss Porter's School, at an IBM training school. Career  IBM 1973-2012  Palmisano joined IBM in 1973 as a salesman. From 1989-1990, he served a one- year stint as executive assistant to then-chairman and CEO John F. Akers. During that time Palmisano was seen as a rising star and he had lunch with former chairman Thomas Watson, Jr. once per month. Palmisano afterwards ran the company's Japanese office. He was appointed senior vice president and group executive of the Personal Systems Group in 1997. He was then promoted to senior vice president and group executive of IBM Global Services in 1998, during the period when IBM shifted its focus from pure technology to embrace outsourcing and other services. He became senior vice president and group executive of Enterprise Systems in 1999 when the systems group drove IBM's move to adopt the Linux operating system. Before leading IBM Global Services, Palmisano led the IBM strategic outsourcing business and before that he was president of an IBM subsidiary‚ÄîIntegrated Systems Solutions Corporation‚Äîwhich ultimately became IBM Global Services. Palmisano was elected president and chief operating officer (COO) effective in October 2000. =Chief Executive Officer= Palmisano was promoted to CEO in March 2002 and named chairman effective January 1, 2003, succeeding the retiring Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. after the Dot-com bubble bust. While his predecessor had saved the company from bankruptcy by downsizing the workforce and cutting costs and then leading IBM's resurgence with systems integration and services consulting (such as e-commerce), Palmisano's goal was to reestablish IBM as a standard-setting company. He was influenced by the Watsons, the company founders who \\"always defined I.B.M. as a company that did more than sell computers; they believed that it had an important role to play in solving societal challenges\\". Palmisano's mandate was to move into new businesses with high-profit margins and potential for innovation. This included purchasing PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in 2002 so that IBM could go beyond selling computers and software and help customers use technology to solve business challenges (marketing, procurement, and manufacturing). During his tenure, the company also acquired 25 software companies that specialized in data mining and analytics so that IBM could help companies and governments to find patterns in web and internal data. Palmisano also prepared the company for cloud computing, originally known inside IBM as on-demand computing, where the center of innovation would be services and software, delivered over the Internet from data centers and connecting to PCs and other devices. In 2008, despite the financial crisis and economic recession , he launched I.B.M.‚Äôs Smarter Planet initiative which applies computer intelligence to create more efficient systems for numerous applications including utility grids and traffic management. Although the services and consulting businesses, which then-CEO Gerstner had championed, provided most of IBM's revenue, software analytics had higher margins, contributed more profits and had more growth. Palmisano also led the sale of the PC group to Lenovo which closed in 2005. The move was controversial inside IBM, as it had invented the personal computer in the 1980s, and the PC was one of the company's few products widely used by the masses and created strong brand recognition for IBM. Although it fell behind rivals during the 1990s, that division helped drive sales of other I.B.M. products in corporate accounts, and its purchasing power helped lower the cost of components for larger IBM offerings like mainframes and servers. As IBM's PC group was profitable and generated around US$20 billion in yearly revenue, the divestiture resulted in IBM ceding the title of the world's largest information technology firm (by revenue) to Hewlett-Packard, the latter whose revenue had increased due to the acquisition of Compaq in 2002. However to Palmisano, moving to new high-margin businesses meant exiting low-margin businesses like PC manufacturing, plus PC manufacturing was becoming commoditized and offered few opportunities for innovation. It took five years but Palmisano was vindicated from 2010 onward as the Post-PC era of technology took hold, with smartphones and tablet computers supplanting PCs as the primary computing devices of choice. Also recognizing that drives were becoming a commodity, he sold off IBM's disk drive business to Hitachi and then signed a five-year deal to buy Hitachi drives. As CEO of IBM, Palmisano has shifted many development and support positions to emerging markets. He was elected to the board of ExxonMobil in 2006. He is also the Honorary Chairman of National Engineers Week 2008. In November 2008, Palmisano, during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, outlined IBM's Smarter Planet initiative. While CEO of IBM in 2009, Palmisano earned a total compensation of $21,159,289, which included a base salary of $1,800,000, a cash bonus of $4,750,000, stocks granted of $13,517,401, no options, and other compensation of $1,091,888.2009 CEO Compensation for Samuel J. Palmisano , Equilar In 2010 Palmisano was awarded The Deming Cup, an excellence award presented by the W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity, and Competitiveness at Columbia Business School, for his ability to drive IBM to new levels of operational excellence and for his role in creating and leading IBM's Global Services business unit. Palmisano announced on October 25, 2011, that he was stepping aside as president and CEO, being succeeded by Ginni Rometty effective on January 1, 2012. Palmisano continued to serve as Chairman of the Board until October 1, 2012.  After IBM  Samuel J. Palmisano is the Chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise, a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of the contemporary corporation, the management science in a globally interconnected world. The CGE was established in 2013 to help educate societal stakeholders ‚Äì as well as leaders from the private sector, public sector, and academia ‚Äì on the globally integrated economy and its promise for a better future. In May 2013 Bloomberg LP appointed Palmisano as an independent advisor for the company's privacy and data standards. In February 2016, President Barack Obama appointed Palmisano as the Vice Chairman of a new White House cybersecurity commission tasked with helping the country better defend itself against and withstand cyber attacks, The Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.

Construction of the bridge was begun in the late 13th century by Richard Cementarius, although its completion was not until 1320 at the time of the Scottish War of Independence. After falling into disrepair in the mid 16th century it was extensively renovated in 1605. Throughout its history the bridge has been considered an important asset. For five centuries possession of the bridge was the only way to move large armies quickly along the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire. It also provided a trade route to the wealthy areas of the north-east of Scotland. The bridge is constructed of granite and sandstone. Its single gothic arch has span of over and at low tide the apex of the arch lies over above the water-line. The bridge ceased to be a major route in 1830 when the new Bridge of Don was built downstream. History The text below is taken from the notes of a public talk History of the Brig o'Balgownie given by Dr. Christopher P. Croly from the Archaeological Unit at Aberdeen City Council. Origin of the bridge's name The name \\"Balgownie\\" comes from the surrounding area, Balgownie, which from an early time was a barony. The name itself has a Gaelic origin, but is a source of some debate. Some authorities believe that the first part of the name derives from Baile and means \\"town\\". However the very earliest references to the barony, or settlement, of Balgownie invariably have the word as Palgoueny, or Polgowny, or a number of minor variants, generally starting with Pol. Pol relates to a pool, probably the one known as the \\"black neuk\\". However it may be that P and B are interchangeable and the distinction may not affect the meaning. There are two possible suggestions for the second part, some say that gabhainn, genitive of gabhann, means a \\"of a cattle-fold\\" whilst others have asserted that it derives from gobhainn which indicates a blacksmith, or just a smith. The first recorded instance of the name of Polgowny dates from 1256, but it is in all likelihood older. Who built the bridge The familiar story is that the stone bridge was commissioned by either Bishop Henry Cheyne or Robert the Bruce, or indeed was begun by the former and completed by the latter, and that the work was done by Richard Cementarius. It is said that Cheyne started the work but fled Bruce's troops, and then Bruce finished the work later on. However, the earliest written version of the origins of the bridge is slightly at odds with later ones. The first written history of the bridge was by Sir Alexander Hay, in a charter of 1605. In the charter he wrote that the bridge \\"was built by command, and at the expense of, the deceased most invincible prince, Robert Bruce, king of the Kingdom of Scotland.\\" This account only contains one element of what becomes a fairly consistent story. Parson Gordon was the first to record a fuller version of the story some sixty years after Hay. He wrote: \\"No man can certainly tell who builded the Bridge of Done. The commone and most probable reporte is that the renouned Prince Robert Bruisse, King of Scotland, at such tyme as he banished B. Henrie Cheyne from his sea, and drave him out of Scotland beside, did command for to sequester the bishops yeerlie revenue to be imployed towards pious uses, and that this bridge (which is lyke to be true) was builted with a part of that revenue.\\" Thus the two earliest versions of this story both put the onus for building the bridge on Robert the Bruce, and neither mention involvement by Bishop Cheyne. This story has been repeated a number of times over the centuries often with only minor changes. In 1780 Francis Douglas wrote that it \\"is said to have been built by Henry Cheyne, bishop of Aberdeen, about the year 1290, or by King Robert the Bruce, who perhaps completed what the bishop had begun.\\" In the 19th century Camden wrote that \\"it was projected by Bishop Henry Cheyne ‚Ä¶ and built at his expense\\". In the 20th century Alexander Keith tells all elements of the story: that it was started by Bruce or Cheyne, but certainly completed by the former. He favours the Bruce version citing Hay and Boece as his evidence. The story about the involvement of Cementarius is an entirely new one, and seems to be no older than the 20th century. It was perhaps first stated by W. Douglas Simpson. Richard Cementarius is often cited as the first Provost of Aberdeen, or rather the first Alderman. However, that can not be correct: what would be correct would be to say that he is the first person whose name has been connected with that office in some official document, and that therefore he is the first recorded Provost of Aberdeen. However that does not seem to be true either. Certainly Richard is an historical figure: there is a contemporary reference to Richard in the Exchequer Rolls return for Aberdeen of 1264 which refers to \\"Magistro Ri. Cementario\\" in the context of work being carried out of Aberdeen Castle. What is important is that he is not specifically described as \\"provost\\". Other documents about him all refer to him as a burgess of the Burgh, but never as provost. Moreover, he seems to have been dead by 1294. In that year Malcolm of Palogoueny and Duncan the merchant, both described as burgesses, wrote a charter in which they acted as guarantors of the estate of the late Richard, also described as burgess. He had left monies and annual rents to the altar of St John the Apostle in the Church of St Nicholas. The altar itself he seems to have founded in 1277. So from these it is probable that he was alive in 1277 but dead by 1294, therefore any involvement that he had with building the bridge would have to have been before 1294. As we do not know when the bridge was built it is unclear if he could have been involved. But it is a modern story whose only real prop is the similarity between the arch in the bridge and an arch in Drum Castle, also ascribed to Cementarius, but not proved and that certainly needs more research. However, it may simply have reflected a common building style.

However, Alexander also notes (p.xlvii) that Pit often refers to a town in the same sense as Bal, so it is possible that Pol was a different element with a different meaning. # gives 'town of the cattlefold'. # # In the ecclesiastical statutes of St Machar's issued in 1256 the rights of the salmon fishing at Palgoueny were given to the deacon of the Cathedral, # # # # Camden goes on to note that the story is in all likelihood false and he favours the Bruce version, as he relies on Hay's charter as evidence. # Keith quotes the following from Boerce, 'out of joy that he was received into the King's favour, upon his return home, he applied all the rents of his see, which during his absence had accresced to a considerable sum, towards building the stately bridge over the River Don'. However, in , in the part where he deals with Cheyne there is no mention whatsoever of his part in the building of the bridge suggesting Keith's quote is entirely fraudulent.

He joined Mumbai police - then known as Bombay - in 1995, and rose to fame as an encounter-specialist in the late 1990s. As a member of the Detection Unit, he gunned down more than 80 gangsters of the Mumbai underworld. In 2006, he was temporarily suspended, based on allegations of criminal links and disproportionate income by a journalist with underworld links. The Anti- Corruption Bureau could not find any evidence against him, and he was reinstated by the Mumbai Police in 2012. He was transferred to Nagpur in January 2014, and suspended in July 2015 after he reportedly declined to join his new posting at Nagpur fearing his family‚Äôs safety. The transfer order was cancelled in August 2015, and Nayak was reinstated in January 2016.  Early life  Daya Nayak was born in the Yennehole village of the Karkala taluk, Udupi district in a poor Konkani-speaking family. He studied till the 7th standard in a Kannada-medium school built by his grandfather. In 1979, he came to Mumbai, after his father asked him to earn some money to help the family. He worked at a hotel canteen, sleeping on the hotel's porch. He continued his education while working, and graduated 8 years later from the CES college in D.N. Nagar. After graduating, he started working with a plumber as a supervisor, earning a monthly salary of 3,000. He continued staying at the hotel until he got a police job.  Police career  Daya Nayak joined the Bombay Police as a trainee in 1995. After completing his training, he was posted to the Juhu police station in 1996. His first encounter killing happened on the night of 31 December, when he shot dead two members of the Chhota Rajan gang after they opened fire on him. Subsequently, he was shifted to the special squad working against the gangsters. In 1997, he was hospitalised after being shot twice and badly wounded by a gangster. Before being shot, he managed to shoot the criminal dead in front of a huge crowd. By 2004, he had killed 83 gangsters, acquiring reputation as an \\"encounter specialist\\". Nayak himself disapproved of the sobriquet \\"encounter specialist\\", insisting that he is not a trigger-happy man but was forced to kill gangsters to prevent more \\"bloodshed and mayhem\\". He also states that none of his encounter killings have been fake. He slowed down after the deputy chief minister R. R. Patil reined in the encounter specialists.  School in Yennehole  Daya Nayak built a school in his native village Yennehole. The money for building the school was collected through donations from Bollywood personalities in name of the Radha Nayak Educational Trust (named after Nayak's mother). The school was inaugurated by Amitabh Bachchan in 2000 in presence of celebrities like M. F. Husain, Suniel Shetty and Aftab Shivdasani. It was later handed over to the Government of Karnataka, and is now known as the Radha Nayak Government High School.  Allegations of corruption and criminal links  In 2003, Ketan Tirodkar, a journalist, accused Daya Nayak of having links with the Mumbai underworld, and of amassing wealth disproportionate to his income through illegal means. Tirodkar alleged that he had become friends with Nayak in 2002, and ran an extortion business with him. Nayak was investigated by the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court for links with the underworld. He came out clean in investigations conducted by ACP Shankar Kamble in 2003 and by DCP K L Bishnoy in 2004. He was given clean chit after another inquiry by ACP Dilip Sawant in 2004. The same year, Tirodkar was taken into custody on the charge of having links with the Dubai-based don Chota Shakeel. In 2006, Nayak was arrested during an investigation led by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) ACP Bhim Rao Ghadge. The ACB officials raided his house on 21 January 2006. He was suspended a day later. The school built by him was also raided without the knowledge of approval of the Karnataka state government. On 18 February 2006, a sessions court issued a non-bailable warrant against him in the disproportionate assets case after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the sessions court, the Bombay High Court and after the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere in the case and directed him to surrender. Two days later, he surrendered as directed and was sent to judicial custody. Nayak spent 14 days in police custody and 45 days in judicial custody, and was released on bail after no chargesheet could be filed against him due to lack of evidence. The 2003 complaint against him stated that he had amassed wealth worth crores of rupees. ACB found his assets to be worth much less ‚Äì Rs. 8,917,000, but still filed a chargesheet against him, stating that these assets were disproportionate to Nayak's monthly salary of 10,000 as a sub- inspector. Nayak was accused of floating bogus companies with help of his associate Rajendra Phadte, and getting his wife Komal to take property loans from these companies to launder his money. The ACB also stated that he had dealt properties in name of his brother-in-law and Phadte. The ACB summoned Them 27 times, but could not find any evidence. ACB arrested him at the insistence of the IPS officer Pradnya Saravade, on the charge of laundering Daya Nayak's money. He was jailed for 62 days, during which both his parents died. He appealed to the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC). The Commission chairman Justice Kshitij R. Vyas criticised the arrest and passed strictures against Pradnya Saravade for her high handedness. MSHRC imposed a fine of on the state government, asking it to be recovered from Saravade. Nayak insisted that all his money was accounted for, and every transaction was made by cheque. He also pointed out that his assets had been shown as inflated. For example, his Tata Sumo was a government vehicle and the 200,000 rupee expense reimbursed by the government for a post-encounter hospital stay had been counted as an asset. Ghadge claimed that Nayak had assets in Switzerland and owned hotels in Dubai. Nayak denied this, saying that he had never travelled outside India. The ACB alleged that Nayak had transferred 1 billion to a foreign contact from a cyber caf√© in Goa. It claimed that he was in Goa on 18 January 2006, but his duty records proved that he was at the Charkop Police station. ACB also brought up the point that a person called D Naik had travelled several times between Mumbai and Goa by air. It was later found out that the person was the Goa minister Damodar Naik. According to Nayak's supporters, he was framed by some of his colleagues who had close ties with the underworld criminals, whom Nayak had fought with. Nayak himself termed Ghadge as the \\"most corrupt officer\\", and alleged that Ghadge had filed an FIR against him after he refused his demand for a bribe of 10 million. In 2008, after the Soharbuddin Sheikh fake encounter case came to light, Tirodkar filed one more affidavit stating that Daya Nayak was involved in the death of Sadiq Jamal, another alleged fake encounter by the Gujarat Police. According to Tirodkar, the Gujarat police had asked Daya Nayak and him to supply \\"a Muslim boy with some criminal background\\" to the Gujarat Police, and in response, Nayak handed over Sadiq Jamal to them. In 2010, the Court quashed all the MCOCA charges against him.  After reinstatement  On 16 June 2012, the Mumbai Police reinstated Daya Nayak. He was posted in the Local Arms unit. He was then posted to the Western Zone, and worked out of Bandra. In January 2014, he was transferred to Nagpur. However, he did not report there, and was suspended in July 2015. The transfer order was cancelled in August 2015, and Nayak was reinstated in Mumbai Police on 11 January 2016.  In popular culture  The Hindi films Ab Tak Chhappan by Shimit Amin and N Chandra's Kagaar are based on Nayak's life, as is the Kannada film Encounter Daya Nayak. Ab Tak Chhappan was later remade into Telugu as Siddham. The 2007 film Risk by Vishram Sawant has overtones from Daya Nayak's life. A Telugu film, titled Golimaar released in 2010 is also inspired by his life. The 2012 Bollywood film Department highlights the encounter specialists of the Mumbai Police; Daya Nayak's role is played by Sanjay Dutt. Sequel to Ab Tak Chhappan was released in February 2015 titled Ab Tak Chhappan 2.

Jenkins worked with The Andrews Sisters, Johnny Cash, The Weavers, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Judy Garland, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Harry Nilsson, Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald. Biography Career Gordon Jenkins was born in Webster Groves, Missouri. He began his career writing arrangements for a radio Station in St. Louis. He was hired by Isham Jones, the director of a dance band known for its ensemble playing, which gave Jenkins the opportunity to develop his skills in melodic scoring. He also conducted The Show Is On on Broadway. After the Jones band broke up in 1936, Jenkins worked as a freelance arranger and songwriter, contributing to sessions by Isham Jones, Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Andre Kostelanetz, Lennie Hayton, and others. In 1938, Jenkins moved to Hollywood and worked for Paramount Pictures and NBC, and then became Dick Haymes' arranger for four years. In 1944, Jenkins had a hit song with \\"San Fernando Valley\\". In the 1940s, he was music director for the radio version of the program Mayor of the Town, and his orchestra provided the music for Ransom Sherman's program on CBS. In 1945, Jenkins joined Decca Records. In 1947, he had his first million- seller with \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" featuring vocalist Charles LaVere and, in 1949, had a hit with Victor Young's film theme \\"My Foolish Heart\\", which was also a success for Billy Eckstine. At the same time, he regularly arranged for and conducted the orchestra for various Decca artists, including Dick Haymes (\\"Little White Lies\\", 1947), Ella Fitzgerald (\\"Happy Talk\\", 1949, \\"Black Coffee\\", 1949, \\"Baby\\", 1954), Billie Holiday (\\"Crazy He Calls Me\\", \\"You're My Thrill\\", \\"Please Tell Me Now\\", \\"Somebody's on My Mind\\", 1949, and conducted and produced her last Decca session with \\"God Bless the Child\\", \\"This Is Heaven to Me\\", 1950), Patty Andrews of the Andrews Sisters (\\"I Can Dream, Can't I\\", 1949) and Louis Armstrong (\\"Blueberry Hill\\", 1949 and \\"When It's Sleepy Time Down South\\", 1951). The liner notes to Verve Records' 2001 reissue of one of Jenkins' albums with Armstrong, Satchmo In Style, quote Decca's A& RDirector Milt Gabler, saying that Jenkins \\"stood up on his little podium so that all the performers could see him conduct. But before he gave a downbeat, Gordon made a speech about how much he loved Louis and how this was the greatest moment in his life. And then he cried.\\" During this time, Jenkins also began recording and performing under his own name. One of his enduring works while at Decca was a pair of Broadway-style musical vignettes, Manhattan Tower and \\"California\\" which saw release several times (78s, 45s, and LP) in the 1940s and 1950s. The two were paired on a very early Decca LP in 1949, and Jenkins was given the Key to New York City by its mayor when Jenkins's orchestra performed the 16-minute suite on The Ed Sullivan Show in the early 1950s. Manhattan Tower was also a Patti Page LP album, issued by Mercury Records as catalog number MG-20226 in 1956. It is her version of Gordon Jenkins' popular 1948/1956 Manhattan Tower suite and the album charted at #18 on the Billboard charts. The album was reissued, combined with the 1956 Patti Page album You Go to My Head, in compact disc format, by Sepia Records on September 4, 2007. Jenkins also made a rare excursion into film work in 1952 when he scored the action film Bwana Devil, the first 3-D movie shot in color. His Seven Dreams released in 1953 included \\"Crescent City Blues\\", which was the source for Johnny Cash's popular recording, \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\". In 1956, he expanded Manhattan Tower to almost three times its length, released it (this time on Capitol Records), and performed it on an hour-long television show. (Both versions of \\"Manhattan Tower\\" are currently available on CD.) His final long-form work was The Future, which made up the entire third disk of Frank Sinatra's 1980 Grammy-nominated Trilogy album. Although the piece was savaged by critics, Sinatra reportedly loved the semi-biographical work and felt that Jenkins was treated unfairly by the media. Jenkins headlined New York's Capitol Theater between 1949 and 1951 and the Paramount Theater in 1952. He appeared in Las Vegas in 1953 and many times thereafter. He worked for NBC as a TV producer from 1955 to 1957, and performed at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964. By 1949, Jenkins was musical director at Decca, and he signed ‚Äì despite resistance from Decca's management ‚Äì the Weavers, a Greenwich Village folk ensemble that included Pete Seeger among its members. The combination of the Weavers' folk music with Jenkins' orchestral arrangements became popular. Their most notable collaboration was a version of Lead Belly's \\"Goodnight Irene\\" (1950) backed by Jenkins' adaptation of the Israeli folk song, \\"Tzena, Tzena, Tzena\\". Other notable songs they recorded together are \\"The Roving Kind\\", \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" (1951), and \\"Wimoweh\\" (1952). Also while at Decca Records Jenkins arranged and conducted several songs for Peggy Lee including her 1952 major hit recording of Rodgers and Hart's \\"Lover,\\" which she also performed in the Warner Bros. remake of The Jazz Singer (1952 film). Lee also had chart successes with the Jenkins-arranged \\"Be Anything (But Be Mine)\\" and \\"Just One of Those Things.\\" After a brief stint with RCA's \\"X\\" Records Jenkins was hired by Capitol, where he worked with Frank Sinatra, notably on the albums Where Are You? (1957) and No One Cares (1959), and Nat King Cole, with whom he had his greatest successes; Jenkins was responsible for the lush arrangements on the 1957 album Love Is the Thing (Capitol's first stereo release, which included \\"When I Fall in Love\\", one of Cole's best-known recordings), as well as the albums The Very Thought of You (1958) and Where Did Everyone Go? (1963). Jenkins also wrote the music and lyrics for Judy Garland's 1959 album The Letter which also featured vocalist Charles LaVere, and conducted several of Garland's London concerts in the early 1960s. Whilst most of Jenkins' arrangements at Capitol were in his distinctive string-laden style, he continued to demonstrate more versatility when required, particularly on albums such as A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra (1957), which opens with a swinging version of \\"Jingle Bells\\", and Nat King Cole's album of spirituals, Every Time I Feel The Spirit (1960), which includes several tracks with a pronounced \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{2}{4} beat that might almost be described as rock. He also produced a diverse set of charts for his critically acclaimed 1960 album Gordon Jenkins Presents Marshal Royal, a jazz- pop crossover project with Count Basie's alto saxophonist which included both strings and a swinging rhythm section. However, as rock and roll gained ascendancy in the 1960s, Jenkins' lush string arrangements fell out of favor and he worked only sporadically. However, Sinatra, who had left Capitol to start his own label, Reprise Records, continued to call upon the arranger's services at various intervals over the next two decades, on albums such as All Alone (1962), September of My Years (1965), for which Jenkins won a Grammy Award, Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back (1973), and She Shot Me Down (1981). Jenkins also worked with Harry Nilsson, arranging and conducting A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night (1973), an album of jazz standards. The Nilsson sessions, with Jenkins conducting, were recorded on video and later broadcast as a television special by the BBC. Although best known as an arranger, Jenkins also wrote several well-known songs, including \\"P.S. I Love You\\", \\"Goodbye\\" (Benny Goodman's sign-off tune), \\"Blue Prelude\\" (with Joe Bishop), \\"This Is All I Ask\\", and \\"When a Woman Loves a Man\\". Jenkins also composed the \\"Future\\" suite for Sinatra's 1980 concept album Trilogy: Past Present Future, and scored the music for the 1980 film The First Deadly Sin, which starred Sinatra in his last major film role. Personal life Jenkins married high school sweetheart Nancy Harkey in 1931 and had three children: Gordon Jr., Susan, and Page. In 1946, he divorced Harkey and married Beverly Mahr, one of the singers in his band. They had a son, Bruce. Jenkins also recorded an album with Beverly Jenkins for Impulse! in 1964, entitled Gordon Jenkins Presents My Wife The Blues Singer. Toward the end of his life, he was in a near-fatal automobile accident, which left him debilitated. Nonetheless, he conducted a full orchestra for a recording session in spite of his pain. Jenkins died of Lou Gehrig's disease in Malibu, California, eleven days shy of his 74th birthday. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Gordon Jenkins among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He was best known for his trilogy A Scots Quair, set in the north-east of Scotland in early years of the 20th century. Biography Born in Auchterless, and raised in Arbuthnott in the former county of Kincardineshire, Mitchell started working as a journalist for the Aberdeen Journal in 1917, and later for the Farmers Weekly after moving to Glasgow. Gibbon grew up in Stonehaven, and attended Mackie Academy. Around that time he was active with the British Socialist Party. In 1919, Mitchell joined the Royal Army Service Corps and served in Iran, India and Egypt before enlisting in the Royal Air Force in 1920. In the RAF he worked as a clerk and spent some time in the Middle East. When he married Rebecca Middleton (known as Ray) in 1925, they settled in Welwyn Garden City. He began writing full time in 1929, producing numerous books and shorter works under his real name and his pseudonym. He suffered an early death in 1935 from peritonitis brought on by a perforated ulcer. Fiction Mitchell attracted attention from his earliest attempts at fiction, notably from H. G. Wells, but it was his trilogy entitled A Scots Quair, and in particular its first book Sunset Song, with which he made his mark. A Scots Quair, with its combination of stream-of- consciousness, lyrical use of dialect, and social realism, is considered to be among the defining works of the 20th century Scottish Renaissance. It tells the story of Chris Guthrie, a young woman growing up in the north-east of Scotland in the early 20th century. All three parts of the trilogy have been turned into serials by BBC Scotland, written by Bill Craig, with Vivien Heilbron as Chris. Additionally, Sunset Song has been adapted into a film, released in 2015. Spartacus, a novel set in the famous slave revolt, is his best-known full-length work outside this trilogy. In 1934 Mitchell collaborated with Hugh MacDiarmid on Scottish Scene, which included three of Gibbon's short stories. His stories were collected posthumously in A Scots Hairst (1969). Possibly his best-known is \\"Smeddum\\", a Scots word which could be best translated as the colloquial term \\"guts\\". Like A Scots Quair, it is set in north-east Scotland with strong female characters.review of \\"Smeddum\\" It was dramatised by Bill Craig and the BBC, as a Play for Today in 1976, along with two other short stories, \\"Clay\\" and \\"Greenden\\".Play for Today website Also notable is his essay The Land. Remembrance The Grassic Gibbon Centre was established in Arbuthnott in 1991 to commemorate the author's life. There is a memorial to him and his wife, and other members of the Mitchell family, in the western corner of the village churchyard (parish church of Saint Ternan) of Arbuthnott, nowadays in Aberdeenshire. In 2016 Sunset Song was voted Scotland's favourite novel in the BBC Love to Read campaign.

Aberdeen University Press, 1981. was a pioneering Scottish photographer. In 1849, he began a career as a portrait miniaturist, switching to portrait photography in 1852. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He pioneered various techniques for outdoor photography and the mass production of photographic prints as he gradually began to largely do landscape photography in the 1860s. By 1864 he claimed to have sold over half a million prints. Biography After studying art in Edinburgh and London, Wilson returned to his native city of Aberdeen in 1849 and established a business as a portrait miniaturist catering to the wealthy families of the North East of Scotland. After some years of mediocre success, Wilson ventured into portrait photography in 1852, setting up a portrait studio with John Hay in 25 Crown Street in Aberdeen. From there, aided by his well-developed technical and commercial acumen and a contract to photograph the Royal Family while documenting the building of Balmoral Castle in 1854-1855, he established himself as one of Scotland's premier photographers working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1860. Pioneering the development of techniques for photography outside of the studio and the mass production of photographic prints, he moved increasingly from portraiture to landscape photography in the 1860s. He also produced stereoscopic pictures whose main characteristic was that exposures were very short. By 1864 he claimed to have sold over half a million prints. At the time of his death in 1893 (he had handed over the business to his sons, Charles, Louis and John Hay Wilson in 1888) the firm employed 40 staff and was one of the largest publishers of photographic prints in the world, competing with James Valentine, who was also a prolific photographer, with a large company in Dundee. The business survived until 1908, when it was wound up at auction.Alastair J Durie, \\"Tourism and commercial photography in Victorian Scotland: the rise and fall of G W Wilson & Co., 1853-1908,\\" Northern Scotland, vol.12, 1992.

A pioneering physician in the treatment of anemia, while stationed in Puerto Rico Ashford organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign against hookworm, which cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This reduced the death rate from associated anemia by 90 percent. He was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission. Early years Ashford was born in Washington D.C. as one of five children in the family of Francis Ashford, a prominent physician, and his wife. His general education was obtained at the public schools and at Columbian University in Washington D.C. (now George Washington University). In 1896, he graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine. He served as resident physician in several area hospitals.\\"Bailey K.

They had three children: Mahlon, Margarita, and Gloria Mar√≠a. Professional life Hookworm treatment Serving as the medical officer in the general military hospital in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1899 he was the first to describe and successfully treat North American hookworm. He was a tireless clinician and conducted an exhaustive study of the anemia caused by hookworm infestation, which was the leading cause of death and responsible for as many as 12,000 deaths a year. From 1903‚Äì1904, together with his colleague Pedro Guti√©rrez Igarav√≠dez, he organized and conducted a parasite treatment and education campaign, which treated approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This work reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent. Through Ashford's professor, Charles Wardell Stiles, his work also led to the creation of a seminal campaign to fight hookworm in the American South that was funded by John D. Rockefeller. Anemia treatment Captain Ashford was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission. By special authority of the Secretary of War, he served on the Commission from 1904‚Äì1906. School of Tropical Medicine In 1911, his proposal for an Institute of Tropical Medicine (Later renamed School of Tropical Medicine) in Puerto Rico was approved by Antonio R.

This puts the time reversal symmetry of (almost) all known low-level fundamental physical processes at odds with any attempt to infer from them the second law of thermodynamics which describes the behaviour of macroscopic systems. Both of these are well- accepted principles in physics, with sound observational and theoretical support, yet they seem to be in conflict, hence the paradox.  Origin  Josef Loschmidt's criticism was provoked by the H-theorem of Boltzmann, which employed kinetic theory to explain the increase of entropy in an ideal gas from a non-equilibrium state, when the molecules of the gas are allowed to collide. In 1876, Loschmidt pointed out that if there is a motion of a system from time t0 to time t1 to time t2 that leads to a steady decrease of H (increase of entropy) with time, then there is another allowed state of motion of the system at t1, found by reversing all the velocities, in which H must increase. This revealed that one of Boltzmann's key assumptions, molecular chaos, or, the Stosszahlansatz, that all particle velocities were completely uncorrelated, did not follow from Newtonian dynamics. One can assert that possible correlations are uninteresting, and therefore decide to ignore them; but if one does so, one has changed the conceptual system, injecting an element of time-asymmetry by that very action. Reversible laws of motion cannot explain why we experience our world to be in such a comparatively low state of entropy at the moment (compared to the equilibrium entropy of universal heat death); and to have been at even lower entropy in the past.  Before Loschmidt  In 1874, two years before the Loschmidt paper, William Thomson defended the second law against the time reversal objection.Thomson, W. (Lord Kelvin) (1874/1875). The kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy, Nature, Vol. IX, 1874-04-09, 441‚Äì444.  Arrow of time  Any process that happens regularly in the forward direction of time but rarely or never in the opposite direction, such as entropy increasing in an isolated system, defines what physicists call an arrow of time in nature. This term only refers to an observation of an asymmetry in time; it is not meant to suggest an explanation for such asymmetries. Loschmidt's paradox is equivalent to the question of how it is possible that there could be a thermodynamic arrow of time given time- symmetric fundamental laws, since time-symmetry implies that for any process compatible with these fundamental laws, a reversed version that looked exactly like a film of the first process played backwards would be equally compatible with the same fundamental laws, and would even be equally probable if one were to pick the system's initial state randomly from the phase space of all possible states for that system. Although most of the arrows of time described by physicists are thought to be special cases of the thermodynamic arrow, there are a few that are believed to be unconnected, like the cosmological arrow of time based on the fact that the universe is expanding rather than contracting, and the fact that a few processes in particle physics actually violate time-symmetry, while they respect a related symmetry known as CPT symmetry. In the case of the cosmological arrow, most physicists believe that entropy would continue to increase even if the universe began to contract (although the physicist Thomas Gold once proposed a model in which the thermodynamic arrow would reverse in this phase). In the case of the violations of time-symmetry in particle physics, the situations in which they occur are rare and are only known to involve a few types of meson particles. Furthermore, due to CPT symmetry reversal of time direction is equivalent to renaming particles as antiparticles and vice versa. Therefore, this cannot explain Loschmidt's paradox.  Dynamical systems  Current research in dynamical systems offers one possible mechanism for obtaining irreversibility from reversible systems. The central argument is based on the claim that the correct way to study the dynamics of macroscopic systems is to study the transfer operator corresponding to the microscopic equations of motion. It is then argued that the transfer operator is not unitary (i.e. is not reversible) but has eigenvalues whose magnitude is strictly less than one; these eigenvalues corresponding to decaying physical states. This approach is fraught with various difficulties; it works well for only a handful of exactly solvable models.Dean J. Driebe, Fully Chaotic Maps and Broken Time Symmetry, (1999) Kluwer Academic Abstract mathematical tools used in the study of dissipative systems include definitions of mixing, wandering sets, and ergodic theory in general.  Fluctuation theorem  One approach to handling Loschmidt's paradox is the fluctuation theorem, derived heuristically by Denis Evans and Debra Searles, which gives a numerical estimate of the probability that a system away from equilibrium will have a certain value for the dissipation function (often an entropy like property) over a certain amount of time.D. J. Evans and D. J. Searles, Adv. Phys. 51, 1529 (2002). The result is obtained with the exact time reversible dynamical equations of motion and the universal causation proposition. The fluctuation theorem is obtained using the fact that dynamics is time reversible. Quantitative predictions of this theorem have been confirmed in laboratory experiments at the Australian National University conducted by Edith M. Sevick et al. using optical tweezers apparatus. This theorem is applicable for transient systems, which may initially be in equilibrium and then driven away (as was the case for the first experiment by Sevick et al.) or some other arbitrary initial state, including relaxation towards equilibrium. There is also an asymptotic result for systems which are in a nonequilibrium steady state at all times. There is a crucial point in the fluctuation theorem, that differs from how Loschmidt framed the paradox. Loschmidt considered the probability of observing a single trajectory, which is analogous to enquiring about the probability of observing a single point in phase space. In both of these cases the probability is always zero. To be able to effectively address this you must consider the probability density for a set of points in a small region of phase space, or a set of trajectories. The fluctuation theorem considers the probability density for all of the trajectories that are initially in an infinitesimally small region of phase space. This leads directly to the probability of finding a trajectory, in either the forward or the reverse trajectory sets, depending upon the initial probability distribution as well as the dissipation which is done as the system evolves. It is this crucial difference in approach that allows the fluctuation theorem to correctly solve the paradox.  The Big Bang  Another way of dealing with Loschmidt's paradox is to see the second law as an expression of a set of boundary conditions, in which our universe's time coordinate has a low-entropy starting point: the Big Bang. From this point of view, the arrow of time is determined entirely by the direction that leads away from the Big Bang, and a hypothetical universe with a maximum-entropy Big Bang would have no arrow of time. The theory of cosmic inflation tries to give reason why the early universe had such a low entropy.

Description It is a herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial plant growing to 50 cm tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and more or less erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are compound, borne on a 4‚Äì20 cm long petiole and divided into three broad leaflets 1.5‚Äì8 cm long, shallowly to deeply lobed, each of which is stalked, distinguishing the species from Ranunculus acris in which the terminal leaflet is sessile.Parnell, P. and Curtis, T. (2012). Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. The leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets and may be simple and lanceolate. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are golden yellow, glossy, and 2‚Äì3 cm diameter, usually with five petals, and the flower stem is finely grooved. The gloss is caused by the smooth upper surface of the petal that acts like a mirror; the gloss aids in attracting pollinating insects and thermoregulation of the flower's reproductive organs.Buttercups focus light to heat their flowers and attract insects New Scientist 25 February 2017 The fruit is a cluster of achenes 2.5‚Äì4 mm long.

Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast . Cultivation and uses Creeping buttercup was sold in many parts of the world as an ornamental plant, and has now become an invasive species in many parts of the world. Like most buttercups, Ranunculus repens is poisonous, although when dried with hay these poisons are lost. The taste of buttercups is acrid, so cattle avoid eating them. The plants then take advantage of the cropped ground around it to spread their stolons. Creeping buttercup also is spread through the transportation of hay. Contact with the sap of the plant can cause skin blistering.Ranunculus repens. Plants for a Future Etymology Ranunculus is a diminutive of 'rana', meaning 'little frog'.

Scott Ian once recalled that Eddie Vedder was a fan of the album as well, saying he \\"cornered me one night at a party for 25 minutes telling me this story about the first time he heard Speak English Or Die and how it affected his life.\\" Slipknot and Stone Sour vocalist Corey Taylor wrote an introduction in the 30th anniversary edition saying how Speak English or Die has impacted his life. There were also plans for a Speak English or Die tribute album featuring multiple artists during the late '90s, but the release never materialized.

Life and career  Manuel M√©ndez Ballester was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, in 1909, where he was raised and received his primary education. Relocating to New York in his teens, he initiated secondary schooling, but upon his return to Puerto Rico, continued his studies on his own. While still in his adolescence, and due to economic urgency, he begins to work as a clerk in several commercial houses of Aguadilla and San Juan. He later served in the offices of the District Court of Aguadilla. His next profession was as the Administrator of the Central Coloso sugar cane refinery, a task that allows him first hand account of the social life, customs and problems of the sugar cane workers. This association and knowledge would prove of great value for the development of his literary role as a dramatist. M√©ndez Ballester began to participate in and became fond of local theater productions, and by 1931, his journalistic ventures led him to be collaborator and then editor of Atalaya y Letras, a local cultural periodical in Aguadilla. M√©ndez Ballester enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, seeking to become a lawyer, but before finalizing the first year of studies he dropped out to pursue a career in radio programming for the Department of Public Education. He returned to the university in 1935 as an evaluator and assessor of teachers for workers whom the Administration of Reconstruction of Puerto Rico sponsored. Isla Cerrera, written in 1937, was his first novel, and was a historical view of the early days of Spanish colonization. El Clamor de Los Surcos, his first popular play in 1938, received high accolades by Ateneo Puertorrique√±o. His classic tragedy in three acts, Tiempo Muerto, premiered in 1940. This is considered to be his masterpiece and the one most associated with M√©ndez Ballester. It is set in the sugar cane fields of Aguadilla and deals with the workers during the off season or \\"dead time,\\" thus the title. In 1943 he organized la Sociedad General de Autores (General Society of Authors) with whom he presented two new drama works: Hilaric√≥n in 1943, and Nuestros D√≠as in 1944. He then developed a more comical than satirical style with his El Misterio del Castillo in 1946, Un Fantasma Desentito in 1950, the farce Es de Vidrios la Mujer in 1952, and El Curioso Impertinente. In 1958 he wrote Encrucijada, and El Milagro in 1961, followed by La Feria o El Mono con la Lata en el Rabo (1963). In 1965 he wrote Bienvenido Don Goyito, a popular play which is still revered today. In 1968 he published Arriba las Mujeres, in 1970, the dramatic piece La Invasi√≥n, √≥ Jugando al Divorcio and in 1975 back to comedy with Los Cocorocos. M√©ndez Ballester was interested in politics and became a senator for the city of San Juan, and upon his retirement from politics dedicated himself to become Puerto Rico's foremost dramatist and man of letters. He died on January 23, 2002. There was a solemn funeral in his parents' native town of San Sebasti√°n, then a procession to Aguadilla, where there was a service at the Inter American University, where he had donated all his literary papers and historical documents to a library named in his honor. Luz Odilia Font Mendez Ballester is credited with discovering the talents of a young actress, his then neighbor in San Juan, the also San Sebastian native Luz Odilia Font.https://prpop.org/biografias/luz-odilia-font/ See also *List of Puerto Rican writers *List of Puerto Ricans *Puerto Rican literature *Miguel √Ångel Su√°rez References External links *Sala Museo Manuel M√©ndez Ballester- Interamerican University 1909 births 2002 deaths Puerto Rican writers People from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico ","title":"Manuel M√©ndez Ballester"},{"id":"708866","text":"Barbara Allan Simpson (born July 29, 1937) is an American retired TV reporter, news anchor, and conservative radio talk show host.

Clad in a cape and domino mask, DeMarco undergoes psychiatric treatment with Marlon Brando's character, Dr. Jack Mickler, to cure him of his apparent delusion. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on the psychiatric staff, some of whom find themselves inspired by DeMarco's delusion; the most profoundly affected is Dr. Mickler himself, who rekindles the romance in his complacent marriage. The movie is based on two different sources; the modern-day story is based on director/screenwriter Jeremy Leven's short story Don Juan DeMarco and the Centerfold (the movie's original title before the studio changed it shortly before release), while the flashbacks depicting DeMarco's back-story are based on the more familiar legend of Don Juan, especially as told by Lord Byron in his version of the legend. Depp received the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year, along with his performance in Ed Wood while the film's theme song, \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\\", co-written and performed by Bryan Adams, was nominated for the Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Plot Psychiatrist Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) dissuades a would-be suicide - a 21-year-old man who is costumed like Zorro and claims to be Don Juan (Johnny Depp), who is then held for a ten-day review in a mental institution. Mickler, who is about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation and conducts it without medicating the youth. \\"Don Juan\\" tells his story - born in Mexico, the death of his father, a year in a harem, and finding true love (and being rejected) on a remote island. Listening enlivens Mickler's relationship with his own wife, Marilyn (Faye Dunaway). As the ten days tick down, and pressure mounts on Mickler to support the youth's indefinite confinement, finding reality within the romantic imagination becomes Jack's last professional challenge. Cast * Marlon Brando as Dr. Jack Mickler/Don Octavio de Flores * Johnny Depp as John Arnold DeMarco/Don Juan * Faye Dunaway as Marilyn Mickler * G√©raldine Pailhas as Do√±a Ana * Bob Dishy as Dr. Paul Showalter * Franc Luz as Don Antonio * Rachel Ticotin as Do√±a Inez * Talisa Soto as Do√±a Julia * Tom Lister Jr. as Rocco Compton * Richard C. Sarafian as Detective Sy Tobias * Tresa Hughes as Grandma DeMarco * Stephen Singer as Dr. Bill Dunmore * Selena as ranchera singer * Marita Geraghty as woman in restaurant scene Music The film features the original Bryan Adams song, \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\\"; the lyrics incorporate quotes from Depp's character, and the melody is used as a musical motif throughout the film. In addition, the song itself is performed three times, once by Selena and a mariachi band serenading the characters in Spanish, once by Jose Hernandez and Nydia, as background music (again in Spanish), and once by Bryan Adams during the closing credits. The song is also available on the soundtrack. The song was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song at the 68th Academy Awards, but lost to \\"Colors of the Wind\\" from Pocahontas. Selena recorded other songs for the soundtrack, including \\"El Toro Relajo\\". The score was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Michael Kamen and was performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra. Tori Amos and Michael Stipe of R.E.M. recorded a duet for the film called It Might Hurt a Bit but it remains unreleased. Reception Critical response Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 69% based on review from 36 critics with an average rating of 6/10. Box office The film had an estimated budget of $25 million, grossing just $22,150,451 in the U.S. With a total $68,592,731 gross worldwide, it was then considered a hit for New Line Cinema. Upon its opening weekend, Don Juan DeMarco opened at #4 with $4,556,274 behind the openings of Bad Boys and A Goofy Movie, and the second weekend of Tommy Boy.

His stay at the Shots was a brief one, and in June 2006 he moved to Notts County, and was team captain for the 2007‚Äì08 season. It was announced on BBC East Midlands Today, during a feature presented by the player, that he would not be retained by the club for the 2008‚Äì09 campaign. Following his release from the Magpies, signed for Mansfield Town on 1 August 2008. Lee signed for Kettering Town on 13 January 2009, for the remainder of the 2008‚Äì09 season from Mansfield Town. Lee scored once in six league games for Kettering, his strike coming in a 2‚Äì1 loss to Stevenage on 27 January 2009. He moved on to Corby Town, making his d√©but in a 3‚Äì3 draw against Farnborough on 21 March 2009. He joined Ilkeston Town of the Conference North on 1 April 2010, scoring on his d√©but in a 2‚Äì1 victory over AFC Telford United. After a long and wide-ranging career Lee announced his retirement from football in November 2010 following the death of his mother. Lee came out of retirement in March 2011 when he joined Arnold Town, debuting in the club's Northern Counties East League 1‚Äì0 defeat at Hallam on 8 March 2011. The same week he was announced as the Matchday VIP Host for former club Lincoln City, a role which would limit his availability for Arnold. His second, and final, league appearance for the club saw him sent-off for two yellow cards, the second for the use of the elbow, in the 4‚Äì2 defeat to Pickering Town on 19 March 2011. Management career On 22 March 2011, Lee, along with Lee Canoville was confirmed as caretaker coach of Boston United following the resignation of joint first team managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst. Lee re-registered himself as a player towards the end of the 10‚Äì11 season. He made three appearances, including the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Shield and one Conference North playoff-game. Jason Lee was sacked as manager in December 2012 after a run of poor results in the 2012/13 season leaving the Pilgrims in 10th place.\\"Jason Lee sacked as Boston United manager\\" BBC Sport, 6 December 2012  Football administration  In 2013 Lee became the Equalities Education Executive for the Professional Footballers Association (PFA). In response to David Baddiel blackfacing to make fun of him in the 1990s, Lee said: \\"I'd ask them if they realised the significance of what they were doing. It was, looking back, a form of bullying. I work in equalities now, and it can affect different people in different ways. I don't think people appreciate the possible harm it can cause.

Many species are popular in horticulture. The genus name comes from the ancient Greek \\"aionos\\" (ageless). While most of them are native to the Canary Islands, some are found in Madeira, Morocco, and in East Africa (for example in the Semien Mountains of Ethiopia). Description The succulent leaves are typically arranged on a basal stem, in a dense, spreading rosette. A feature which distinguishes this genus from many of its relatives is the manner in which the flowers bear free petals, and are divided into 6 or 12 sections. Each rosette produces a central inflorescence only once, and then dies back (though it will usually branch or offset to produce ensuing rosettes). Low-growing Aeonium species are A. tabuliforme and A. smithii; large species include A. arboreum, A. valverdense and A. holochrysum. They are related to the genera Sempervivum, Aichryson and Monanthes, as can be seen by their similar flower and inflorescences. Recently, the genus Greenovia has been placed within Aeonium. Much hybridising has been done, resulting in several cultivars of mixed or unknown parentage. The following species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit:- *Aeonium tabuliforme *Aeonium haworthii *Aeonium haworthii 'Variegatum' *Aeonium 'Blushing Beauty' *Aeonium 'Sunburst' *Aeonium 'Zwartkop' Distribution Most aeoniums are from the Canary Islands, but some are from Madeira, Morocco and East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya) and Yemen.

Its area roughly correlates to the Ballaj√°, Catedral, Marina, Mercado, San Crist√≥bal, and San Francisco subbarrios of barrio San Juan Antiguo in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Old San Juan is the oldest settlement within Puerto Rico and the historic colonial section of the city of San Juan. This historic district is a National Historic Landmark District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old San Juan Historic District. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Location Aerial view of Old San Juan in 1952 Old San Juan is located on a small and narrow island which lies along the north coast, about from the east end of Puerto Rico, and is united to the mainland of Puerto Rico by three bridges. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and to the south by San Juan Bay (or \\"Bahia de San Juan\\")‚Äîwhich lies between the city and the mainland. On a cliff about high, at the west end of the island and commanding the entrance to the harbor, rise the battlements of Fort San Felipe del Morro, in which there is a lighthouse. The \\"Ca√±o de San Antonio\\" lies to the southeast, where the island of Old San Juan connects to the mainland through Santurce, by three bridges, \\"Puente Dos Hermanos\\" (Ashford Avenue), \\"Puente G. Esteves\\" (Ponce de Le√≥n Avenue) and \\"Puente San Antonio\\" (Fern√°ndez Juncos Avenue). The city is characterized by its narrow, blue cobblestone streets, and flat roofed brick and stone buildings which date back to the 16th and 17th century‚Äîwhen Puerto Rico was a Spanish possession. Near Fort San Felipe del Morro, is the Casa Blanca, a palace built on land which belonged to the family of Ponce de Le√≥n. History Origins In 1508, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n founded the original settlement, CaparraEB-Guaynabo- Puerto-Rico Guaynabo; [with a history of Puerto Rico]; \\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\"; 2006; Britannica.com webpage; Text: names Caparra, the first Spanish settlement of Puerto Rico (1508). (named after the Province of C√°ceres, Spain, birthplace of the then-governor of Spain's Caribbean territories, Nicol√°s de Ovando). The ruins of Caparra are known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, behind the almost land-locked harbor just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. In 1509, the settlement was abandoned and moved to a site which was called at the time \\"Puerto Rico\\" (meaning \\"rich port\\" or \\"good port\\"), a name that evoked that of a similar geographical harbor in the island of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. In 1521, the name \\"San Juan\\" was added, and the newer settlement was given its formal name of \\"San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico\\", following the usual custom of christening the town with both its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the islands, honoring John the Baptist. Expansion and growth The wall that surrounds Old San Juan (as seen near the San Juan Gate) Constructed in 1521, Casa Blanca served as the first fortification of the settlement and residence of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n descendants, until the mid-eighteenth century.

Centro de Investigaciones CARIMAR / Oficina Estatal de Preservaci√≥n Hist√≥rica.A Conservation Master Plan for the World Heritage Site of Old San Juan; Prof. Martin E. Weaver La Fortaleza was built between 1533 and 1540, which was followed by the construction of a battery at \\"the Morro.\\" Plans for the castle portion of San Felipe del Morro were made in 1584. Extensions to the Morro, plus construction of El Ca√±uelo, and El Boquer√≥n, were made between 1599 and 1609. Circumvallation of the city commenced in 1630 and was concluded by 1641. San Cristobal fort was completed by 1771. By 1776, the population totaled 6000, half of which were soldiers. The garrison town of San Juan included 250 acres of military installations and 62 acres of public and private use. By 1781, the city's fortifications included 376 cannon. By 1876, 24,000 lived inside the walls of San Juan, encompassing 62 acres, and 926 buildings. Prior to the 19th century, the area outside the city walls occupying the east side of Old San Juan Island, was almost uninhabited. In 1838 the so-called area of Puerta de Tierra (or \\"Land Gate\\") had a population of 168 residents, mainly of African descent. According to a census made in 1846, the population had risen to 223 inhabitants living in 58 houses. On March 3, 1865, the municipal government of San Juan approved a resolution promoting the city expansion across the Puerta de Tierra which included the plan for demolishing the city walls along the eastern side. On May 28, 1897, the wall demolition was officially started after a proclamation was issued by Queen Maria Christina. By the year 1899, the population of Puerta de Tierra had risen to 5,453; while the area comprising the old walled city had a civilian population of roughly 18,103 inhabitants. Maintaining architectural integrity During the late 1940s, disrepair in the old city was evident. The local authorities were considering development proposals for renovating the old city and incorporating modern architecture on new constructions. Anthropologist Ricardo Alegr√≠a vehemently advised against the idea of razing old colonial buildings in favor of contemporary building designs. He followed the example suggested by his father, a local civic leader who had successfully prevented the demolition of the Capilla del Cristo in favor of a traffic redesign. He advised mayor Rinc√≥n de Gautier in having local zoning laws changed to favor remodeling and the incorporation of Spanish colonial motifs in any new construction. This helped preserve the city's architectural profile, and has been a key to San Juan's current status as a tourist destination.

Castillo San Felipe in the background Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, as a senator and later as governor of Puerto Rico, supported and implemented what became known as Operation Bootstrap, which included the development of the tourism industry. In 1948 the government invited one of the organizers of Colonial Williamsburg to lead its tourism development efforts. These efforts were further supported by the 1955 creation of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±a) head by Alegr√≠a. He sought legal and administrative changes that would allow for major remodeling efforts to be successful. At the time, most real estate in Old San Juan had devalued under appraised values because the city was perceived as unsafe (particularly because of building disrepair and social ills such as prostitution) and not profitable for business (because of rent control statutes, as well as the reluctance of commercial banks to fund remodelings). Under combined efforts by the institute and the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, \\"model\\" remodelings were made to show potential property owners how their renewed properties could look. Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. As with other Operation Bootstrap projects, mainland corporate investors were lured in with tax breaks and other incentives. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared a historic building, and asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. As in other Operation Bootstrap projects, the Woolworth family was invited in 1957 to reconstruct the former convent (which had more recently been a low-rent apartment building and city garage) into the luxury Hotel El Convento. The Bank provided low interest loans to remodelers, and the government gave triple tax exemptions to commercial activities in the old city (they were exempted for a limited time, not only from property taxes and municipal taxes, but from income tax from activities generated in their properties as well). At least one retailer from the shopping district in Charlotte Amalie was given incentives to set up shop in the Calle del Cristo (the city's red light district during the early 1940s) in order to persuade other retailers to follow suit and somehow \\"clean up\\" the district. Potential developers were offered sketches of their properties after a remodeling, as to suggest which architectural elements to improve or change. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in Latin America, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias. Paseo de La Princesa Historic designations Painted door and street art in Old San Juan The San Juan National Historic Site was established in 1949 to preserve historic fortifications in Old San Juan. The historic site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. La Fortaleza along with the San Juan National Historic Site were then declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) in 1983. The casco (old city within the city walls) of San Juan was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2013. Today La Casita in Old San Juan With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air caf√©s, restaurants, colorful homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectural peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for domestic and international tourism. The district is characterized by numerous public plazas, which are filled with local shops that sell traditional craftwork, such as Taino sculptures and typical musical instruments. Moreover, Old San Juan is known for its churches, such as San Jos√© Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. Tourists' main spot to visit at Old San Juan is Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a fort built by the Spaniards when settled on the Island. Besides the magnificent fort, tourists are drawn to La Perla, a colorful neighborhood outside of the historic city wall. Old San Juan is one of the two barrios, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan after 1864 and prior to 1951, in which the former independent municipality of R√≠o Piedras was annexed. Blockhouses and subbarrios Old San Juan The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the Fort San Felipe del Morro, Castle of San Crist√≥bal, and el Palacio de Santa Catalina (also known as La Fortaleza), acted as the primary defense of the settlement which has been subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. Old San Juan's land area roughly correlates to the following subbarrios of barrio San Juan Antiguo: Ballaj√°, Catedral, Marina, Mercado, San Crist√≥bal, and San Francisco. Public transportation Old San Juan is the location for one of two transportation hubs serving Metropolitan San Juan. At one time, a free trolley provided limited service to Old San Juan seven days a week but is not available any longer. People get around the city on foot or by car.  Popular Culture  Old San Juan is the setting for films, books, song lyrics and music videos, including the following. Noel Estrada, a Puerto Rican composer, wrote the popular song \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\" in 1943. The song has been recorded by over 1,000 times by artists around the world, including many Puerto Rican musicians such as Trio Vegabaje√±o, Danny Rivera, Marc Anthony, Luis Miguel, Jos√© Feliciano, among many others. The Rum Diary, a film based with Johnny Depp based on Hunter S. Thompson‚Äôs memoir was filmed in Old San Juan; the film is set in the 1960s. United States of Banana (2011), a geopolitical tragicomedy about Puerto Rican independence by Giannina Braschi, has battle scenes set in old San Juan, including La Fortaleza, La Perla, El Capitolio, El Morro, and El Escambron beach. Music videos by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny, and Marc Anthony are set in Old San Juan. The song Despacito, which won Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video. The music video of \\"Despacito\\" featured La Perla.

This taxon is no longer used according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005. Ponder and Lindberg (1997) in the book The Southern Synthesis, showed the Orthogastropoda as one of two subclasses of the Gastropoda, the other subclass being a very much smaller group called the Eogastropoda, which contained only 5 families of true limpets. This subclass, Orthogastropoda, which one perhaps could call the true snails, was defined most concisely as all gastropods which were not members of Patellogastropoda, the true limpets. The Orthogastropoda appeared to form a clade which was supported by unambiguous synapomorphies. These synapomorphies (a series of characteristics that appear in its members but not in the other forms it diverged from) were the identifying characteristics of the clade. Some of the characteristics were: *eyes with a vitreous body on eyestalks. *paired jaws, with their position free from the buccal mass *a single kidney on the right side of pericardium *a flexoglossate radula (with a flexible radular membrane). The radula is the snail's tongue, used as a rasping tool. *unpaired osphradium (olfactory organ). *lateral ciliated zones of osphradium *a single left hypobranchial gland (on organ at gill, which releases secretions, such as the reddish dye Tyrian purple). *an unpaired ctenidium (a comblike respiratory structure in certain mollusks)  Taxonomy  The following is based on the somewhat out-dated taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997).

The district is located adjacent to the immediate downtown area, though in the first major town plan for Helsinki from the mid-18th century, the area fell outside the fortifications planned to encircle the city. Originally, it was a headland of the Helsinki peninsula but is now technically an island, as a small canal was dug across the base of the headland in the 19th century. Katajanokka is one of the most distinguished neighbourhoods in Helsinki. Katajanokka's residents include former Finnish President (from 1982 to 1994) Mauno Koivisto and composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. Uspenski Cathedral  Overview  The south side of Katajanokka is dominated by a passenger harbour which is frequented by large cruiseferries traveling between Helsinki, Stockholm, Mariehamn, Tallinn and Rostock. The rest of the district comprises co-operative apartment buildings and several small parks. The western part of the residential area, known as the \\"Old Side\\" of Katajanokka, is an upscale neighborhood and a well-preserved example of early 20th century Art Nouveau architecture, though up until the mid-19th century ‚Äì while the centre of Helsinki was being filled with stone buildings ‚Äì the area was essentially still a wooden shanty town. The eastern part was for a long time a closed military area containing a naval base and shipyard, later a commercial shipyard. It was redeveloped in the 1970s and 1980s into a mainly residential zone, often referred to as the \\"New Side\\" of Katajanokka. The new residential area is considered an exceptional example of modern town planning. A major part of the project was the conversion and extension of the old Russian naval barracks to house the Finnish foreign ministry. The northern shore of Katajanokka still serves as a base for the Finnish coast guard, Helsinki maritime police as well as the Finnish icebreaker fleet. Housing cooperatives built around 1902 in the popular Jugendstil style. The Finnish icebreaker fleet docked for the summer season on the northern side of Katajanokka Landmarks of Katajanokka include the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, also known as Uspenski Cathedral (architect Alexey Gornostaev, 1868), the Merikasarmi complex of the Foreign Ministry (architect Carl Ludvig Engel, 1825) and the Finnish headquarters of Stora Enso (architect Alvar Aalto, 1962; the most controversial of Aalto's works). The Katajanokka prison (now a Best Western hotel). Another famous building in Katajanokka is the former district prison of Southern Finland. The old prison dates back to 1837, and functioned as a prison until 2002. The prison underwent an extensive interior renovation to convert the cells of the prison into hotel rooms, with sets of two or three cells combined to make up the current hotel rooms. The Best Western Premier Hotel Katajanokka opened in May 2007 with 106 guest rooms. Renovations cost a reported 15 million euro. As a historic building, strict limits were imposed on the redevelopment due to the strict regime of protection for historically significant buildings that is in effect in Finland. Thus, as a hotel, the exterior of the building has been preserved, as has the central corridor of the old prison and even the old prison wall. A restaurant at the lowest level of the hotel has attempted to keep much of the character of the old prison alive, and is called the \\"Jailbird Restaurant\\". However, an actual former prisoner told a Finnish newspaper that the supposed \\"prison cutlery\\" is very different from what the prison actually used: for example, prisoners never drank out of tin cups. Katajanokka is the harbour of many large cruiseferries; M/S Gabriella from the Viking Line fleet docked to Katajanokka terminal. During the development of Katajanokka in the 1970s and 1980s, many old red brick industrial buildings were spared by converting them for public uses, such as a primary school and an indoors sports arena. Recently, there was controversy over the demolition of the former cadet school of the Russian navy, built in the early 20th century. Vacated by the Finnish military in the 1980s, the building survived, with various uses, mainly as a cultural centre. In the late 1990s, the city of Helsinki announced that it was going to demolish the building to build a new apartment building in its place. This caused huge protests, and the demolition was put off for almost a decade, mainly because of opposition from local inhabitants, and the Green League party. The navy school building was finally demolished in autumn 2006. However, additional problems resulted: Contrary to what the city of Helsinki and the architecture bureau responsible for the new building had thought, there was no solid rock bottom underneath the old building, but only scattered rocks here and there. Because the original building had stood there since Czarist Russia, no original construction plans were available, and therefore the new plans had to be redone from scratch. The Katajanokanpuisto park (\\"Katajanokka park\\") was renamed as Tove Janssonin puisto (\\"Tove Jansson's park\\") on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The ceremony was attended by Moomintroll himself. The local community organisation of Katajanokka is called Katajanokkaseura. The organization publishes an annual regional magazine, Katajanokan kaiku (Finnish for \\"The Echo of Katajanokka\\"). There is an annual running event called the Katajanokan ymp√§rijuoksu, open for everyone who lives in Katajanokka or has relatives living there.  Architecture  right Katajanokka is principally known for its fine examples of Jugendstil architecture. Other prominent styles apparent on the island are modernism, manifested in Alvar Aalto's Enso-Gutzeit Building, and the red-brick industrial former harbour buildings and prison (now a Best Western hotel).
