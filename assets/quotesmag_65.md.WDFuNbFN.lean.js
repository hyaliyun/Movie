It was originally programmed for the Apple II, then widely ported. The game was published in North America by Broderbund and in Europe by Ariolasoft. Along with Swashbuckler (1982), Karate Champ (1984), and Yie-Ar Kung Fu (1985), Karateka was one of the earliest fighting games. The player controls an unnamed protagonist who is attempting to rescue his love interest, the Princess Mariko, from Akuma's castle fortress. The game exhibits a combination of fighting game and side-scrolling beat 'em up elements. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress. A 2012 remake, led by Mechner, was released in 2012 as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and iOS. Gameplay Apple II version. Karateka uses gameplay elements found in both side-scrolling 2D platformers and fighting games. The player is introduced to the unnamed hero as he ascends a mountain into Akuma's fortress to rescue Princess Mariko. As the player directs the hero into the fortress, various foes appear and attempt to stop him. Once in a fighting stance, the player punches and kicks at each enemy, while trying to dodge their attacks. The player's health, shown by a bar on the bottom of the screen, loses a notch for every hit taken, though health is recovered slowly by not engaging in combat. Should the player lose all his health, the game is over, requiring the player to start again. The enemy's health bar is shown on the screen as well; once theirs is drained, the player has defeated him and can progress forward. In addition to human enemies, Akuma occasionally sends his trained hawk to attack the player, which can be deflected with well-timed punches or kicks. There are some environmental hazards that the player can come upon, such as an open cliffside or a falling portcullis, which end the game immediately if not avoided. Throughout the game, cut scenes are shown, displaying such scenes as Akuma ordering his men to attack the player, and Mariko nervously awaiting her fate. Eventually, the player will reach and face Akuma in a final conflict. Once Akuma is defeated, the player is able to rescue Mariko. If the player gets too close while still in his fighting stance, the princess will kill him in one blow. Once Mariko is freed, she and the player leave the fortress together. An Easter egg is present on the Apple II floppy disk release. Though claimed to be sold as a single-sided disk, the reverse side of the disk included a full version of the game that would be rendered upside-down on the player's monitor. According to Mechner, this was done as a joke, causing naive users to call tech support and ask why the game was upside-down. Invariably, those users received the reply, \\"take the disk out, insert it right-side up, and reboot\\". Development Jordan Mechner programmed Karateka on his own while a student at Yale. Karateka was developed by Jordan Mechner while he was a student at Yale University as a side project between his classes. In learning to program on the Apple II, he had written a clone of Asteroids and a modified version he titled Deathbounce. He submitted Deathbounce to Broderbund, which they declined. They provided Mechner with a copy of Choplifter, then one of the top selling games from Broderbund. Mechner recognized from this game that he could pursue original game concepts instead of having to remake existing titles. Using some of the graphic features that Choplifter provided, Mechner focused on a karate-themed game as a result of numerous factors which included his ongoing studies as a film student, his involvement in several film clubs at Yale, and having recently taken lessons in karate at the time. He also drew inspiration from Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print art, and the cinematic works of Akira Kurosawa, early Disney animated films, and silent pictures; he claimed that such works \\"convey such powerful emotion and atmosphere without a word being spoken\\". One of his goals was to combine cinematic techniques with game elements to create a novel experience; from this, Mechner programmed some of the screen wipes used in Seven Samurai as game elements. In reflecting on the game, Mechner stated that he did not consider the game as a \\"fighting game\\", but instead that of \\"a story-based game where the gameplay mechanic is fighting\\". Mechner used hand- drawn storyboards to plot out the course of the game, such as these images for the opening of the game. Mechner wanted to create fluid animations within the Apple II's eight frames per second capacity, but this was hampered by the presence of additional on-screen elements, such as one of the palace gates. Mechner found that he could not animate and play music (limited to one-note tones) at the same time, forcing him to adapt to these limitations. To create the animations, he used rotoscoping, the process of hand-drawing cartoons superimposed atop each frame of film of his karate instructor demonstrating various moves. Mechner credits his father with creating the music for the game. Work to complete the game took approximately two years, with Mechner submitting the game to Broderbund during the later part of his sophomore year at Yale. Ports Mechner believed that Robert Cook's versions for the Commodore 64 and Atari 800 were the best ports, with some features superior to the original; Mechner's father reorchestrated his music to use these newer computers' improved audio. Ports to the Amstrad CPC and DOS appeared in 1986, to the Atari 7800 in 1987, the Atari ST in 1988, and ZX Spectrum in 1990 though only released in Spain and in Spanish. The game was released in Japan for the Famicom in 1985, ported by Soft Pro. In that version, the Karateka's martial art is specified as Nanto Saishi Ken (ÂçóÊñóÂÜçË©¶Êã≥ South Dipper Retry Fist). An original Game Boy port was done under the name Master Karateka with release limited to Asia. Reception Sales of Karateka had surpassed 500,000 units by 2000. It was Broderbund's best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Compute! in 1985 called Karateka \\"a nominee for the Most Underrated Program of the Year. It's a program that must be seen to be fully appreciated\\". Although the reviewer criticized the player's necessity to restart from the beginning when defeated, It stated that the Apple II version \\"has by far the best animation I've seen in an Apple arcade game. The smoothness of the animation ... makes the game almost as enjoyable to watch as it is to play\\". Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"More like an adventure game with karate thrown in. Actually resembles a Chuck Norris movie in flavor.\\" Info rated the Commodore 64 version three stars out of five, praising the animation but disliking its simple and two-dimensional game play. The magazine concluded that it \\"needs more depth\\". Antic in 1986 liked its \\"cartoon-quality\\" graphics. Although critical of the \\"often slow\\" joystick control system, the magazine concluded that Karateka was \\"fun and extremely addicting\\". According to Dragon, \\"this game has a great plot, animation that'll dazzle your eyes, and player-controlled martial arts action.\\" Remake In February 2012, Mechner announced that he was leading a small independent development group to create a remake of Karateka for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network, and Wii U via the Nintendo eShop. Mechner anticipated a release date of late 2012, which was later announced to be November 2012. The concept for the remake came after Mechner completed work for the 2010 film The Sands of Time. He wanted to do a new project with a \\"guerrilla\\" feel and at a much smaller scale than he had experienced for the film. He also took into consideration that nearly 30 years after the game's release, he was still being asked questions about Karateka in interviews. This led Mechner to remaking Karateka which, outside of the ports near the time of its release, had not undergone a remake. He envisioned that he would be able to retell the story using modern console hardware and without the limitations of the Apple II system. Other factors leading to the remake included the resurgence of small, independent game development in 2010 and 2011, and games such as Limbo that \\"created a powerful emotional atmosphere within a limited budget and scope\\". A screenshot of the high-definition remake of Karateka, which features an updated art style and Quick time event-styled gameplay. Mechner assembled a small independent team at Liquid Entertainment backed by angel investment, to create the remake; this smaller group allowed Mechner to be more hands-on with the game's development. The remake was designed to stay true to core game, described by Mechner as \\"a compact, pick-up-and-play game that is fluid, atmospheric and beautiful\\". Certain cinematic elements, such as being void of dialogue, remain in the remake. Mechner's team focused on improving the game's controls, making them \\"hard to master\\", and encouraging players to run through the title again to improve on their performance. During the remake's development, the team experimented with different approaches, ending up with \\"brand-new combat mechanics\\" and creating a \\"rhythm-based\\" fighter, where \\"you match the rhythm of your opponent‚Äôs attacks and eventually earn your counterattack\\". Mechner, in anticipating frustration for younger players that may have not played the original game, removed the one-shot deaths present in the original that would force the player to restart the game. This is evident in the game's new approach: the player starts as Mariko's \\"True Love\\", as in the original, but should they fail in combat, they then play as a second character, a Monk. They play on from where the True Love fell, and then continue as a third character, a Brute, if the player fails again. While the player can complete the game as any of the characters, the ultimate goal is to reunite Mariko with her True Love, giving the approximate forty-minute game high replayability, according to Mechner. The game maintains the immersion as the player transitions between each character. Mechner stated that some of the humorous additions, such as the possibility of being killed by Mariko at the end of the game, would likely be removed. This was due to his belief that \\"you can‚Äôt surprise people twice the same way\\", and led him to replace this possibility with other secrets for players to discover. Mechner's focus on keeping the game as a simple game to pick up and play led to the decision to distribute the title through downloadable game services. Comic and animation artist Jeff Matsuda was brought into the team to help with character animations, while composer Christopher Tin developed the game's dynamic score.

Coal was discovered in the area in 1875, and later that year, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company began coal mining operations. A group of coal miners were delayed during an early winter storm in 1877, which led to the town's name of Winter Quarters. On May 1, 1900, an explosion in the Winter Quarters Number Four mine killed 200 miners. Despite the mine explosion, the coal mining operations remained active until 1922, when the opening of a new mine in Castle Gate caused many people to relocate there. By 1930, Winter Quarters was abandoned. Geography Winter Quarters is located west of Scofield, near Winter Quarters Canyon. Lower Gooseberry Reservoir is located west of Winter Quarters. Clear Creek and Electric Lake are south of Winter Quarters.  History  Prior to the discovery of coal in 1875, several pioneers had settled in Pleasant Valley, where Winter Quarters was located. In late 1875, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company began coal mining operations. In the winter of 1877, a group of fourteen coal miners led by Peter Morgan were traveling from Fairview to Sanpete County. They became trapped in snow for several months, which led to the camp's name of Winter Quarters. As the Winter Quarters mine developed, miners began to move into the area. As the town grew, the need for a railroad increased. In response to the town's high demand for a railroad, in 1879, Milan Packard, a merchant from Springville, financed the construction of a railroad from Springville to Winter Quarters and Scofield. The railroad was named the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railroad until it was purchased by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1883. Approximately 1,800 people were living in Winter Quarters by 1900, and the mine was considered the safest in the state. The town's Main Street was over a mile long, and it had many businesses, most of which were made of stone. On May 1, 1900, an explosion occurred in the Winter Quarters Number Four mine. Immediately following the explosion, miners working in the Winter Quarters Number One mine, which was connected to the Number Four mine, were killed by the carbon monoxide gas that was a product of the mine explosion. Rescue crews consisting of men from Clear Creek, Castle Gate, and Sunnyside, along with locals from the valley, worked for almost a week recovering bodies. The final death count reported by the Pleasant Valley Coal Company was 200, though other reports reported 246 deaths. 62 of the deceased were Finns. The state inspector's report concluded that the cause of the explosion was an accidental ignition of black powder, which ignited the coal dust in the air. The Pleasant Valley Coal Company supplied each deceased miner with a coffin and burial clothes. The company also provided $500 to each family who was affected by the mine explosion.History to Go on utah.gov Following the mine disaster, mining operations in Winter Quarters continued until a new mine was opened at Castle Gate in 1922. Miners from Winter Quarters and Scofield relocated to the new mine, and as a result, coal production in Pleasant Valley began to decrease. In 1930, the last few residents of Winter Quarters relocated to a more productive area.  Remnants  The walls of the Wasatch Store can be seen from the road leading into Winter Quarters. Several foundations and the remains of the blacksmith shop also remain.Western Mining and Railroad Museum website The railroad bed is now a dirt road leading to Tucker.

It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815; Fries gave it its current name in 1838. A widespread species, it is distributed in the United States, Europe, Africa, and India, and is found growing under spruce and pine in mixed forests. The fruit bodies are characterized by a light grayish cap that measures up to in diameter, waxy gills, a dry stem, and the distinct odor of bitter almonds. An edible but bland-tasting mushroom, extracts of the fruit bodies have been shown in laboratory tests to have antimicrobial activity against various bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.  Taxonomy, classification, and naming  The species was originally named Agaricus agathosmus by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries in 1815; he later moved it into the genus Hygrophorus in 1838. In the interim, English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley named the species Agaricus cerasinus in 1836, although he too would later transfer the species to Hygrophorus in 1860. In 1948, Richard Dennis examined the type material, and concluded that the two names referred to the same species. Additional historical synonyms include Limacium pustulatum var. agathosmum (Kummer, 1871), and Limacium agathosmum (W√ºnsch, 1877). In their 1963 monograph of the Hygrophorus of North America, American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith classified H. agathosmus in the subsection Camarophylli, a grouping of related species characterized by a dry stem, and the absence of a gelatinous outer veil.Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 309. The specific epithet agathosmus is derived from the Greek word agathos meaning ‚Äúgood‚Äù, and osme meaning ‚Äúscent‚Äù. Hygrophorus agathosmus is commonly known as the gray almond waxy cap, or the almond woodwax.  Description  The cap margin of young mushrooms are rolled inwards. The cap is in diameter, and initially convex with the edges rolled inwards. As it ages and the cap expands, it becomes flat, sometimes with the center slightly depressed, or sometimes with a slight central elevation. The color is a dull ashy gray, and when moist, the cap surface is sticky or tacky to the touch. It is smooth, although the edges can have a layer of minute, soft hairs. The flesh is soft, and whitish or watery gray. Hygrophorus agathosmus has a pronounced fragrant odor resembling cherry pitsHesler and Smith, 1963, p.10. or bitter almonds (occasionally the odor is weak). The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem, but in maturity the attachment becomes adnate-decurrent, meaning the gills start to extend down the length of the stem. The gills are white, but become grayish in maturity, close to distant (40‚Äì50 reach the stem), moderately narrow, rather thin. The stem is long by thick, whitish at first, and colored pale ashy in age. It is the same thickness throughout or somewhat narrowed toward the base. It is solid, dry or moist but has no gelatinous universal veil present. When young, the stem surface is evenly covered with tiny fibrils and a fine whitish powder; over time it loses the hairs and the powder and becomes smooth.  Microscopic characteristics  Spores at 1000x magnification. Each minor division equals 1 ¬µm. When viewed in mass, such as with a spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8‚Äì10.5 by 4.5‚Äì5.5 ¬µm, ellipsoid, smooth, and yellowish in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four- spored and measure 48‚Äì65 long by 6‚Äì8 ¬µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175‚Äì350 ¬µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5‚Äì4 ¬µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a fuscous‚Äîa dark brownish- gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an ixocutis, in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out in contrast to the underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film.Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 27. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.  Edibility and antimicrobial activity  The caps flatten as they mature, and may develop a central depression. Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but considered bland. A study of the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits the growth of the yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Similar species  Hygrophorus pustulatus resembles H. agathosmus and has a similar almond odor. However, the fruit bodies of H. pustulatus are smaller, and it produces larger spores (11‚Äì14 ¬µm long). Hygrophorus occidentalis, which grows under conifers or oak, has a sticky stem and less pronounced almond odor. Hygrophorus marzuolus is also similar in appearance, but it lacks a distinctive odor, and has smaller spores than H. agathamosus.Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 329.  Habitat and distribution  Hygrophorus agathosmus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, and it has been isolated, cultivated, and maintained as pure cultures of vegetative fungal inocula for artificial mycorrhization of planting stock in forest nurseries. Fruiting bodies are found scattered under spruce and pine and in mixed woods in the United States. The fungus is also found in Europe (Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Africa, and India.

These account for the majority of their genomic coding capacity. They are considered to form a group, phylogenetically, referred to as flexiviruses, with filamentous virions. Additional species A new virus ‚Äî Sclerotinia sclerotiorum deltaflexivirus 1 ‚Äî has been described that appears to belong to a new genus in this family. The name Deltaflexiviridae has been proposed for this genus. Another virus ‚Äî Fusarium graminearum deltaflexivirus 1 ‚Äî has been described.

He authored Lendas da √çndia (Legends of India), one of the earliest and most important works about Portuguese rule in Asia.Gaspar Corr√™a, \\"The three voyages of Vasco da Gama: and his viceroyalty\\", Introduction, Adamant Media Corporation, 2001, Ana Paula Avelar, \\"Gorreia, Gaspar\\" , in CHAM Letra  Biography  Hormuz Fortress from the Lendas da √çndia (c.1550) Little is known of the author or his family origins and birthplace. It is assumed that he was born in 1492. He lived mostly in Portuguese India, reportedly arriving around 1512-14 to serve as a soldier and then chosen as scrivener to Afonso de Albuquerque, for which he was very proud. He returned to Portugal in 1529 for some time but later returned to India. His work Lendas da √çndia, though written in a rude style,Ethel M. Pope, \\"India in Portuguese literature\\", p. 69, Asian Educational Services, 1989, is considered an indispensable contemporary reference, having profited from his thirty-five years' work in India, and from privileged sources unknown to Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda or Jo√£o de Barros. He wrote the first European account on Asiatic Cholera.Ethel M. Pope, India in Portuguese literature, p. 284, Asian Educational Services, 1989, One theory suggests that he was murdered in Portuguese Malacca, by order of Governor Est√™v√£o da Gama, the son of Vasco da Gama. The 3,500-page Lendas da √çndia manuscript was brought from India to Portugal by Miguel da Gama shortly after Correia's death and copies circulated only among authorised persons. One author claims, without citing any source, that the manuscript was published in 12 volumes in 1556 but, if it existed, no trace remains. His family retained the manuscript of the original, which was printed in 1858 (first part) and 1864 (second part) by the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon. He died around 1563 in Goa, Portuguese India. References Bibliography * CORREIA, Gaspar. Lendas da √çndia (introduction and review by M. Lopes de Almeida).

Each chapter covers the lives of two protagonists on 15 July, St Swithin's Day, for 20 years. The novel attracted generally positive reviews and was named 2010 Galaxy Book of the Year. Nicholls adapted his book into a screenplay; the feature film, also titled One Day, was released in August 2011. Plot Dexter and Emma spend the night together following their graduation from the University of Edinburgh, in 1988. They talk about how they will be once they are 40. While they do not become romantically involved completely, this is the beginning of their friendship. The novel visits their lives and their relationship on 15 July in successive years in each chapter, for 20 years. Emma wants to improve the world, and begins writing and performing plays, which remain unsuccessful, while Dexter travels through the world, drinking and hooking up with women. Eventually both move to London, where Emma becomes a waitress in Kentish Town, at a Tex-Mex restaurant, while Dexter becomes a successful television presenter. While there are various attempts from both sides to start a relationship, coincidences stop Emma and Dexter from getting together, and while they have relationships with other people, they remain best friends, each secretly longing for the other. They are drawn closer through a holiday together and the death of Dexter's mother. Emma breaks up with her boyfriend, Ian, after realising she is creating a life with someone she doesn't love. During this time she is able to find a job as a teacher, after various years of struggle, despite having a \\"double-first degree\\". Dexter, meanwhile, develops a drinking and drug problem, and watches his career collapse. Emma and Dexter's friendship grows increasingly difficult after Emma is constantly hurt by Dexter, who attempts to hide his feelings for her from both her and himself. Finally, after being treated rudely by Dexter at a restaurant, Emma breaks up the friendship. At the wedding of Emma's former roommate, Emma and Dexter meet again. Emma admits that she wants Dexter back. At this juncture, she has just ended an affair with the headmaster of the school she teaches in, and Dexter has fallen in love with another woman, Sylvie, who is pregnant. At this reunion, Dexter invites Emma, who is disappointed by the situation, to his wedding. Emma tries to overcome her problems and begins to write, while Dexter is unemployed and overwhelmed by his role as a father after his divorce from Sylvie, who was having an affair. Emma leaves to go to Paris in the hope of writing a sequel to her first successful children's novel. When Dexter visits her in Paris, he learns that she has met someone and likes him, and for the first time admits his feelings to her. After talking about their relationship, Emma chooses Dexter. Emma and Dexter form a relationship, are happy together, and get married, but Emma wants a child. The couple finds themselves frustrated by their failing attempts to have a child. Dexter, however, is able to open a deli-caf√© and finds himself on his way back to being successful. On the anniversary of the day they met after graduation and the day they got together, Emma and Dexter have an appointment to see a house. While travelling there, Emma has a bike accident and dies. After her death, Dexter finds himself in despair. He starts to drink again and provokes people in bars to get beaten. He is comforted by his ex-wife Sylvie, his father, and his daughter. Three years after Emma's death Dexter travels with his daughter to Edinburgh, where he and Emma met, and they climb the same hill together that he and Emma climbed 19 years earlier. The book ends with a vivid and lingering memory of what happened after that day together 20 years before: their goodbye kiss after the evening, promise to stay in touch, and goodbye. Major themes Writing in The Times, John O'Connell writes, \\"For, in spite of its comic gloss, One Day is really about loneliness and the casual savagery of fate; the tragic gap between youthful aspiration and the compromises that we end up tolerating. Not for nothing has Nicholls said that it was inspired by Thomas Hardy.\\" A critic in The London Paper observes that One Day \\"may be a love story, but it's no fairytale: Nicholls doesn‚Äôt shy from the harsh side of growing up, the disillusionment, regrets, and random cruelty of life.\\". According to Jonathan Coe, writing in \\"Guardian Books of the Year\\" (2009), \\"It's rare to find a novel which ranges over the recent past with such authority, and even rarer to find one in which the two leading characters are drawn with such solidity, such painful fidelity, to real life.\\" Reception The novel attracted mainly positive reviews. Writing in The Guardian, Harry Ritchie called it \\"a very persuasive and endearing account of a close friendship ‚Äì the delight Emma and Dexter take in one another, the flirting and the banter that sometimes hide resentment and sometimes yearning, the way the relationship shifts and evolves as the years pass.\\" Ritchie comments, \\"Just as Nicholls has made full use of his central concept, so he has drawn on all his comic and literary gifts to produce a novel that is not only roaringly funny but also memorable, moving and, in its own unassuming, unpretentious way, rather profound.\\" This story is reminiscent of Same Time, Next Year. Elizabeth Day of The Observer also praises the novel, although criticising \\"its structural flaws\\", since \\"some of the most important events in their life are never recounted.\\" Despite this, she concludes by commenting \\"there is no doubt that One Day is a beguiling read. But although I really liked it, I wanted desperately to love it because Nicholls is, I think, a far better writer than this format allows him to be.\\" The Times deflected comparisons to When Harry Met Sally..., \\"saccharine\\" assumptions, and expectations that the \\"more literary\\" will snobbishly gratify themselves that they never read \\"'commercial' romantic comedies with cartoons and squiggly writing on the cover. Well, be convinced: One Day is a wonderful, wonderful book: wise, funny, perceptive, compassionate and often unbearably sad. It's also, with its subtly political focus on changing habits and mores, the best British social novel since Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up.\\" Author Nick Hornby also praised the book on his blog, calling it \\"A big, absorbing, smart, fantastically readable on-off love story.\\" His blurb is used in some editions of the book, such as the US paperback edition.Hornby, Nick. Blog entry, 3 April 2009. In 2010, the novel was named Popular Fiction Book of the Year at the UK's annual Galaxy National Book Awards ceremony, and was later granted the accolade of Galaxy Book of the Year. Feature film adaptation At the time of the book's publication, Nicholls wrote that he was adapting his novel as a film script. He acknowledged the difficulties in casting people who \\"could be both students and middle-aged! But I think we've found a way.\\" The film was directed by Lone Scherfig for Random House Films and Focus Features, with a theatrical release in August 2011. Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess portrayed Emma and Dexter, respectively. Filming took place in England, Scotland, and France.

It was originally published in 1932 and included in We Are the Living (1933). It was also included in the 1983 collection of Caldwell stories, Stories of Life North & South.. In 1989 Story magazine chose it for re-publication as \\"a classic story\\".. Plot synopsis Two adolescent boys‚ÄîJack, the narrator, and his friend Les‚Äîtake off their clothes to go bathing in a creek recently filled by the rains. The creek is not the best place for the purpose‚Äîthe waters are yellow, the floor is made of ankle-deep stinking muck and it is also full of dead tree limbs, some of them very sharp on bare feet. But it is all that the boys have. The two accuse Old Howes, a farmer whose land is nearby, of deliberately filling the creek with tree limbs in order to keep them away, since they are scaring his cows. (It is revealed that at some past time they did put a drake in his chicken run.) Suddenly, they hear steps. The newcomer turns out to be Jenny, Howes' daughter who is a year or two older than them and for whom they bear a grudge for having \\"told tales\\" and gotten them punished. The boys tell her to go away and after a short and angry altercation she takes their clothes and threatens to hide them where they will never be found. The boys thereupon get out of the water, chase Jenny and drag her back to the edge of the creek. Les suggests dunking her. Jack, however, recalls that when they did it to a coloured boy named Bisco they came close to drowning him, and suggests to mud-cake Jenny instead. Les takes the suggestion but says that for that purpose they should strip Jenny naked. Despite Jenny fiercely resisting and kicking Jack very painfully in the stomach, they manage to get her clothes off and proceed to cover her with stinking mud. Jack however takes care not to put mud on her hair, knowing from experience that it would be very difficult to get off. He also takes care to hang her dress on a bush, to prevent it from becoming dirty. Overtly, the two boys do not think of their acts as sexual, but as a wild \\"horseplay\\" which might have been inflicted also on another boy. However, Jack becomes aware of the softness of Jenny's breasts, and sees her looking at him‚Äîwhich makes him start feeling that they are doing is \\"a mean thing\\". He resists the impulse to touch her breasts again and convinces Les to let her go. Now feeling shy, the boys go behind bushes to dress, though Jenny already saw them naked. For her part she quickly washes off the mud and gets dressed. Les immediately goes away, but Jack lingers, feeling apprehensive of the punishment awaiting him once Jenny tells of what he and Les had done to her. Jenny, however, is less hostile than he expected, and though he feels awkward and tends to run away from her, she actually invites him to walk with her to her home. Hesitantly he says: \\"But you're going to tell, aren't you? Aren't you going to tell what we did to you?\\" Jenny does not answer, but before going into her home she briefly touches his hand and afterwards gives him a look over her shoulder from the door. The story ends with Jack going back to his own home, saying to himself over and over again: \\"Jenny won't tell, Jenny won't tell.\\" Critical opinion Critic Phil Thomas characterizes \\"Indian Summer\\"‚Äîalong with another Caldwell story, \\"The Automobile that Wouldn't Run\\"‚Äîas stories which \\"bubble over with tenderness and gentle humor\\".Review of \\"Stories of Life North & South\\", in The Ledger, Lakeland, Florida, July 10, 1983 References 1932 short stories Works about adolescence Works by Erskine Caldwell ","title":"Indian Summer (story)"},{"id":"25170797","text":"Austin M.

Madsen is most renowned for leading the club from their first relegation in 65 years in 1999 to their first Swedish championship in 16 years in 2004. He also had a prominent role in Malm√∂ FF moving from Malm√∂ Stadion to Stadion. Madsen is also famous for being a controversial figure in the sport such as an incident in 2002 when Madsen verbally criticized referee Anders Frisk in half- time in an Allsvenskan match between Malm√∂ FF and Hammarby IF. Career Sports career As a young football player Madsen played at H√•kanstorps BK scoring 67 goals in 24 games, as of 2009 still holding the goal record at the club. After this he was noticed by Malm√∂ FF who signed him. In Malm√∂ FF he played with legends such as Bo Larsson and Krister Kristensson. After realising that he would not make it to the first team he accepted an offer to start a table tennis section at the club in 1975. The section was very successful and went from playing in the 6th division to becoming Swedish champions in just nine years. Chairman of Malm√∂ FF In 1999, he was appointed chairman of Malm√∂ FF, replacing Hans Cavalli-Bj√∂rkman, who had been chairman since 1975 when he took the position over from club legend Eric Persson. In 2009 Madsen announced that he would step down as chairman before he reaches the age of 70. He announced his decision to not seek re-election as chairman another year and thus his resignation on 14 January 2010. On 18 February 2010 H√•kan Jeppsson was named as Madsen's successor as chairman. The club won one Swedish championship during Madsen's time as chairman; this happened in 2004.

Born Harry James Wignall in New Bedford, Mass., he lived in New Bedford while his father, a US Army officer, was a prisoner of war for three years, held by the Communist Chinese in North Korea. In his youth Harry lived for four years in Mannheim and Frankfurt, Germany while his father was stationed with the US Army Northern Army Command. He graduated from Rancocas Valley Regional High School in Mt. Holly, NJ. He changed his name circa the publication of his first book to Harrison Gradwell Slater. A pianist, he studied with Anthony di Bonaventura and for many years with Paul Doguereau, the noted French pianist who was a pupil of Ravel, Emma Bardac (second wife of Claude Debussy) and Paderewski. In addition to writing and recording, Slater coached many world-class pianists, and served as chairman and Artistic Director of the Peabody Mason International Piano Competition.  Biography  Harrison Gradwell Slater combined the careers of musicologist, pianist and novelist. He has published three books on Mozart, the last of which is the mystery novel NightMusic, which deals with the life and music of Mozart. The sequel, Nocturne,Slater, Harrison Gradwell, Nocturne, Editions Peabody Mason, 2010 explores Chopin's biography and music within a contemporary narrative. For his first book, Slater (the author's pen name since 1995) traveled to fifty-five cities in nine European countries and completed his research over three years with correspondence to archives throughout Europe, always posing unresolved questions about Mozart Gedenkstaetten ‚Äì the palaces, concert halls and salons in which Mozart performed, the houses and taverns in which he lodged, and the churches and public edifices that he visited. The resulting reference book, In Mozart's Footsteps,Wignall, Harrison James, In Mozart's Footsteps, New York: Paragon House, 1991 has been called \\"an amazing feat of scholarship\\" by the pianist, Alfred Brendel,Ibid., Jacket inscription while Nicholas Slonimsky described it as \\"absorbing in its brilliance\\". NightMusic was voted \\"Rising Star of 2003\\" by nine publishing houses, was on the Barnes & Noble bestseller list for mystery trade paperback for nineteen weeks and was optioned for a film.

Memoirs of Carwin, the Biloquist follows the life of a young man by the name of Carwin as he realizes his biloquial, ventriloquist, talents. Carwin develops this ability to perfection, being able to manipulate his own voice to sound like any person he wants. Plot summary Memoirs of Carwin, the Biloquist begins with Carwin as a young boy, about 14 years old, living on a farm with his father and brother in Pennsylvania. Carwin is evidently different from his family in that he strives to have an education, especially through means of reading books. His father does nothing but discourages this desire, and expects Carwin to settle for a simple life on the farm. As a way to break away from his father's repression, Carwin continuously sneaks out into the woods at night with books to read by the moonlight. It is on one of these experiences that Carwin hears the echo of his own voice in the valley, giving him the inspiration to learn how to manipulate his voice. After several nights of practice, Carwin has the ‚Äúpower to impersonate‚Äù different people.Manning, Susan. ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äôs Dark Dreams: Two Fictions of Henry Mackenzie and Charles Brockden Brown.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Life. 21.3 (1997) : 39-56. Web. 20 Nov. 2009. Soon after, Carwin learns of an aunt in Philadelphia that wants to promote his further education, but his father refuses to send him. As an attempt to convince his father, Carwin decides to sneak into his bedroom late at night, impersonate the voice of his dead mother, and have her tell his father to let Carwin go to Philadelphia. This is the first scenario in which Carwin wants to use his voice talents to benefit himself, but before he can execute this plan, a barn on the farm starts on fire, disrupting his father's sleep. After this event, the father decides to give Carwin permission to stay with his aunt. In Philadelphia, Carwin receives a good education, but has to deal with hard times after the death of his aunt. He is left alone, because his aunt left everything in her possession to a faithful servant. For a second time, Carwin decides to use his ventriloquism, this time to imitate the voice of his dead aunt as a way to convince the servant that he is the rightful heir. Again, however, he fails to carry out his plan. At this time, a mysterious upper-class man named Ludloe decides to take Carwin under his wing. Carwin begins to idolize Ludloe for his way of life and his supreme education. Ludloe invites Carwin to travel to Europe with him, and Carwin, having nowhere else to go, willingly agrees. Throughout this relationship, Carwin never confides his biloquial abilities to Ludloe. Mysteriously enough, Carwin discovers that Ludloe is a member in a secret society, and immediately his curiosity is piqued. Carwin wants to be trusted with information about the society, but Ludloe always keeps him at a distance. Ludloe agrees that in time, Carwin might be able to be let into the society, but in the meantime sends Carwin all over Europe to increase his education. Additionally, Ludloe suggests marriage for Carwin as a step closer to his entrance into Ludloe's secret society. Mrs. Benington, a recent widow, is the suggested wife for Carwin, because with marriage he would acquire all her land and property. After this, Ludloe claims that he will start to talk to Carwin about the secret society. At the end of this story fragment, Ludloe requests to speak to Carwin. He demands that Carwin tell him all about his life, with complete honesty. Ludloe argues that the only way to completely trust and have faith in Carwin is to know everything about him. Carwin decides to tell the truth; however, selectively leaves out his biloquial talents. After this conversation, Ludloe admits that he knows an extensive amount of information about Carwin's past, especially regarding a mysterious murder of a woman in Toledo that Carwin was acquainted with. The story ends abruptly here with no conclusion. The reader only knows that Carwin's character reappears later in his life in Wieland; or The Transformation.Brown, Charles Brockden. Wieland; or The Transformation and Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist. Oxford: University Press. 2009. Print. Composition and publishing history Brown began his story in 1798, halted his writing, and continued again in 1803. From November 1803 until March 1805, Memoirs of Carwin, the Biloquist, or Carwin for short, was released in monthly installments in Brown's Literary Magazine. Brown never completed his story, and it has always remained unfinished, and unresolved.Pattee, Fred Lewis. Introduction. Wieland; or the Transformation: Together with Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist: a Fragment. By Charles Brockden Brown. 1926. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1958. ix-xlvi. Print. Carwin is technically the sequel to Brown's previous work, Wieland; or the Transformation, because Brown wrote it five years afterwards; however, the events in Carwin occur prior to the plot established in Wieland.Elliott, Emory. Introduction. Wieland; or The Transformation and Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist. By Charles Brockden Brown. 1994. Oxford: University Press, 2009. vii-xxx. Print. The common connection to the two novels is the character Carwin and his mysterious biloquial abilities. Carwin attempts to develop the history and background of Carwin prior to his appearance in Wieland as a way of clarifying some of the uncertainty that surrounds Carwin throughout Wieland. The fragment There have been many editions of Carwin published since it was originally released, and most critics and authors comment on the fragmented and incomplete nature of the story. For many years, Wieland and Carwin were not published together, and at times, it was difficult for readers to make the connection between the two stories. In the mid 1900s the books finally started being published as a pair, with Wieland always appearing before Carwin, functioning as supplemental pieces of work.Barnard, Philip, and Stephen Shapiro. Introduction. Wieland or the Transformation, with Related Texts. By Charles Brockden Brown. 2009. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co, Inc., 2000. ix-xlvi. Print. Critics have various opinions regarding the incomplete work, ranging from disappointment that such a great piece of work is left open ended, to Brown having deserted his work. A friend of Brown, William Dunlap claimed that Carwin helped to clear up the mystery left in Wieland and that readers \\"will regret that [Brown] did not finish a work so replete with novelty and interest\\".Dunlap, William. ‚ÄúThe Life of Charles Brockden Brown: Together with Selections from the Rarest of His Printed Works, from His Original Letters, and from His Manuscripts before Unpublished.‚Äù Vol. 2. Philadelphia: James P. Parke, 1815. Print. In opposition to this point of view, Carwin is often seen as unhelpful in that it failed to \\"untangle\\" any mystery, leaving absolutely no \\"closure and resolution\\" for those that read the story.Fliegelman, Jay. Introduction. Wieland and Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist. By Charles Brockden Brown. 1991. New York: Penguin Group, 1991. vii-xlii. Print. Carwin seems to end so abruptly that it could not possibly provide any satisfaction, rather creates more confusion regarding the character of Carwin. The idea that he may or may not have been involved in a murder of a woman in Toledo only increases the amount of curiosity swirling around Carwin's past. This sudden and unexpected end can suggest that Brown \\"lost his first conception of his plot and motif\\" as well as his \\"enthusiasm\\", and he \\"gave up his struggle\\" as he \\"abandoned\\" his story in 1805.Pattee, Fred Lewis. Introduction. Wieland; or the Transformation: Together with Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist: a Fragment. By Charles Brockden Brown. 1926. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1958. ix-xlvi. Print. This idea of abandonment of the text is also interpreted as a loss of interest or that Brown stopped writing because \\"his responsibilities turned his attention to other duties\\".Krause, Sydney J., and S.W. Reid. Introduction. Wieland and Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist. By Charles Brockden Brown. 1978. Kent: Kent State University Press, 1978. vii-xxv. Print. To give up one piece to do other things suggests a lack of interest or even a failure to feel as though it could ever be complete. Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist attempts to make a mysterious character a little more understandable, but in never finishing his story, Brown actually leaves the life of Carwin more unexplained and unresolved than it was after the completion of Wieland; or The Transformation.

Over time, the river begins to erode the outer edges of the bar, causing it to become a higher elevation than the surrounding areas. The water level decreases even more as the river laterally erodes the less cohesive bank material resulting in a widening of the river and a further exposure of the braid bar. As the discharge increases, material may deposit about the braid bar since it is an area in the river of low velocity due to its increased elevation in relation to surrounding areas. During times of extremely high flow, the bars may become covered; only to resurface when the flow decreases. Most braid bars do not remain stable or in one location. However, vegetation succession on braid bars can increase the stability of the landform. They are commonly composed of sand or gravel and typically occur in braided rivers.

He later served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1975 to 1982 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. During his time in public office he served as a cabinet minister in different portfolios in the government of Peter Lougheed. Born in Camrose, Alberta, Schmidt grew up in Millet, Alberta. Air Force career Schmidt volunteered for service in the RCAF on January 8, 1941, and was trained at Claresholm under the Commonwealth Air Training Plan. He was quickly shipped overseas to see action in World War II. In August to December 1942, he was placed in Malta, just off Axis Italy, said at the time to be the hottest place for fighting in the world. He was credited with either 8.5 or 10.5 aerial victories (sources differ), including two large Junkers troop-carrying planes, and sank two ships.Edmonton Journal, December 22, 1942, in the \\"Dallas Schmidt\\" information file at the Provincial Archives of Alberta He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on October 5, 1942, and then the bar, for his daring and destructive sorties. During the war he served in No. 227 Squadron. He flew a wide range of military aircraft used by Canada at the time. His aircraft was shot down by enemy fire on five separate occasions. On Christmas Day 1942 he parachuted out of his plane over Malta and through good fortune landed on the island itself, suffering only a twisted leg. He was then transferred to Rhodesia then to Britain where he joined No. 404 Squadron RCAF (the Buffalo Squadron) and attacked German shipping. He came home on leave in August 1943 and was feted as Millet's air ace, before travelling on to visit his parents at Ma-Me-O Beach, Alberta. After V-E Day, he returned to Canada in July 1945 and was released from service in September of that year. He re- enlisted in the Air Force and served his second stint from 1951 to 1956. Political career Schmidt first ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1967 general election in the electoral district of Wetaskiwin. He finished a close second to incumbent Albert Strohschein. Schmidt ran again in the 1975 general election in the electoral district of Wetaskiwin-Leduc. This time he won by a landslide margin over three other candidates to pick up the seat for the governing Progressive Conservative party. On April 3, 1975 Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Schmidt Minister without Portfolio. On August 26, 1976 he was appointed Associate Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Responsible for Public Lands. In the 1979 general election he won in a landslide.

He offers Filipino youth an alternative to street gangs through education, recreating school settings in unconventional locations such as cemeteries and trash dumps. In March 2009, Pe√±aflorida was featured as a CNN Hero as part of the news network's program to honor individuals who make extraordinary contributions to help others. On November 22, 2009, he was named CNN Hero of the Year.  Early life  Efren Pe√±aflorida was born the middle child of Efren Pe√±aflorida Sr., a tricycle driver, and Lucila Geronimo, a housewife. The family eventually started a small nut business to make ends meet. Efren grew up in an urban slum near an open dump site in Cavite City, Cavite, playing amongst garbage and swimming in polluted waters. He would often fall victim to neighborhood bullying. Pe√±aflorida was one of World Vision's sponsored-children during his early childhood. Pe√±aflorida completed his elementary and high school education through the help of scholarships and financial assistance, and received several class awards and honors. In 2000, he graduated from San Sebastian College‚ÄìRecoletos de Cavite with a degree in computer technology, receiving highest honors. He pursued a second course at Cavite City campus of the Cavite State University, graduating cum laude in 2006 with a degree in Secondary Education.  Dynamic Teen Company  In 1997, at 16 years old, Pe√±aflorida started a youth group in his high school aimed at diverting students' attention away from street gangs, and towards community activism and personal development. Joined by other classmates, they named the group \\"Dynamic Teen Company\\". Dynamic Teen Company started as a friendship club of around 20 members, with an aim of providing youth awareness projects, talent and self-development activities, and community services. They collaborated with Club 8586, another community service organization operating in the area. They eventually pioneered the idea of the \\"pushcart classroom\\", wherein pushcarts were stocked with school materials such as books, pens, tables, and chairs, and then used on Saturdays to recreate school settings in unconventional locations such as the cemetery or trash dump.  CNN Hero  Pe√±aflorida was nominated for CNN Heroes by Club 8586, the youth group that financed his elementary and high school education. After sifting through 9,000 nominees from over 100 countries, CNN's Blue Ribbon Panel selected Pe√±aflorida as one of its 28 heroes of 2009. On October 1, Pe√±aflorida was named among the ten finalists. On November 22, he was named CNN Hero of the Year for 2009. The award includes $100,000 cash to continue his work with Dynamic Teen Company.

This vehicle is usually in front of the Presidential Sparecoach and usually trails the vice- presidential limo behind the Vice Presidential Follow-Up Vehicle and is used to counter guided attacks, such as IEDs, rocket-propelled grenades, and anti- tank guided missiles. Its most identifying mark are two collinear antennas mounted on the roof that are solely used in barrage jamming applications, the primary method used to counter IED threats. The antenna configuration can be changed according to threat level, for instance, taller antennas are used to increase the jamming protection distance, or change jamming frequency ranges. The vehicles were modified by Advanced Counter Measure Systems, Inc, a division of Sierra Nevada Corporation. The secondary distinguishing mark are two dome-shaped electronic warfare (EW) sensors. The EW sensors are most likely millimeter-wave radars used to detect the launch of a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) or laser range finder illumination and launch of an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). Upon detection of a launch, or a laser range finder illumination, the system mostly likely triggers a salvo of infrared smoke grenades launched from this vehicle and the presidential limo to provide both a visual smoke screen in the kill zone and to also act as an obscurant for IR and radar guided attacks. This can be assumed, since it is known that the presidential limo is equipped with a driver's vision enhancer system which gives the driver the ability to drive in an infrared smoke environment. The visual obscurants would give the secure package the ability to leave the kill zone, leaving the counter-assault team (CAT) to deal with the threat.

Orion's catalogue would eventually list some 600 titles, and the label had its share of awards‚Äîseveral Grand Prix du Disques, two \\"Recordings of Special Merit\\" from Stereo Review, and the Grand Prix International du Disque Liszt 1977‚Äîbut sales were small, generally less than 25 copies of any given title annually, and the company relied on financial infusions from Cornfield to remain in business. An exception was one of the label's rare non-classical issues, a collection of torch songs recorded by Anita Ellis; with a few thousand copies sold, it was the label's most successful release. Due to conflict with other firms using the name Orion, the firm's name was changed to ORION MASTER RECORDINGS, LLC. As the compact disc decimated the market for conventional records, in 1988 Cornfield opted to retire rather than retool the company's output for the digital era. He donated the Orion archives to the University of Hawaii with the proviso he could reissue recordings at will. The bulk of Orion's archives are being reactivated (streaming) on two Naxos web sites: ClassicsOnLine.com and NaxosMusicLibrary.com.

Within meteorology, inflow normally refers to the influx of warmth and moisture from air within the Earth's atmosphere into storm systems. Extratropical cyclones are fed by inflow focused along their cold front and warm fronts. Tropical cyclones require a large inflow of warmth and moisture from warm oceans in order to develop significantly, mainly within the lowest of the atmosphere. Once the flow of warm and moist air is cut off from thunderstorms and their associated tornadoes, normally by the thunderstorm's own rain-cooled outflow boundary, the storms begin to dissipate. Rear inflow jets behind squall lines act to erode the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and accelerate its forward motion. Thunderstorms Airflow in and around a supercell with the inflow at the base on right. The inflow into a thunderstorm, or complex of thunderstorms, is the circulation of warm and humid air ahead of a trigger convergence zone such as a cold front. This airmass is uplifted by the trigger and form convective clouds. Later, cool air carried to the ground by thunderstorm downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. Inflow can originate from mid-levels of the atmosphere too. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops to the south of the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself. Tropical cyclones Structure of a tropical cyclone with inflow in red. While an initial warm core system, such as an organized thunderstorm complex, is necessary for the formation of a tropical cyclone, a large flux of energy is needed to lower atmospheric pressure more than a few millibars (0.10 inch of mercury). Inflow of warmth and moisture from the underlying ocean surface is critical for tropical cyclone strengthening. A significant amount of the inflow in the cyclone is in the lowest of the atmosphere. Extratropical cyclones A weather map of an extratropical cyclone affecting Great Britain and Ireland. The \\"L\\" symbol denotes the center of the \\"low\\", and the occluded, cold, and warm frontal boundaries are depicted. Polar front theory is attributed to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone was referred to as the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969. The left edge of the conveyor belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along the conveyor belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls in the form of heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence as to whether or not this phenomenon actually exists.

This often gives the tea a deep green colour and a bold taste though variations are greatly affected by the cultivation and production processes. After leaves are harvested by farmers in Japan, they are then processed at either private or often communal processing facilities where they are steamed, rolled, and dried.

The demo for \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was cut by journeyman session singer Jean Thomas on 22 January 1965 at the behest of Atlantic Records president Jerry Wexler, who wanted to offer the song to Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, then a Cameo-Parkway act Wexler was hoping to woo over to Atlantic. Patti Labelle and the Bluebelles did eventually sign to Atlantic, but only after protracted negotiations (their debut label session being on October 7, 1965), which meant \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was still unrecorded in the summer of 1965 when the success of \\"Baby I'm Yours\\" alerted Wexler to the suitability of \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" as a vehicle for the singer of \\"Baby I'm Yours,\\" Barbara Lewis. \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was recorded by Lewis in a July 1, 1965 session at Atlantic Records Recording Studios (NYC) in which Lewis also recorded the B-side \\"Love to Be Loved\\" and a third track, \\"I'm So Afraid.\\" 1 Like \\"Baby I'm Yours,\\" \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was produced by Ollie McLaughlin and Bert Berns, being described as \\"An Ollie McLaughlin production directed by Bert Berns.\\" The arranger and conductor for the session was Artie Butler, with featured personnel on the session being Patti Brown (piano), Vinnie Bell, Al Gorgoni, Trade Martin (guitar), Bob Bushnell (electric bass), Gary Chester (drums), Ted Sommer, Alvin Rogers (chimes, tambourine). \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was released as a single in September 1965 and that November matched the #11 peak of her preceding hit, \\"Baby I'm Yours.\\" Prior to the release of the Barbara Lewis version, the song had been recorded by the Pixies Three, whose version had successfully been pitched to Cameo Parkway. However, before the relevant contract had been finalized, the Barbara Lewis single had begun to break, causing Cameo Parkway to opt out. The Pixies Three consequently disbanded. Barbara Lewis' \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" had an unsuccessful September 1965 release in the UK, where a local cover was cut by producer Shel Talmy with vocalist Liz Shelley. Released 10 September 1965 on Brunswick, this version also failed to chart, but, despite the advance of Lewis' version on the US charts, Shelley's single was given an American release by Decca Records. Bobby Vinton remade the song as \\"I'll Make You My Baby\\". Billy Sherrill produced the track which, as the lead single for the Ev'ry Day of My Life, reached #30 on the Easy Listening chart in Billboard in April 1971, just missing the Billboard Hot 100 by peaking at #101 on the Bubbling Under chart. \\"Make Me Your Baby\\" was covered in late 1975 in a disco style by Canadian singer Suzanne Stevens.

The feminine form is Aula. An alternative pronunciation leads to the variant spellings Olus or Ollus and Olla. Aulus was widely used by both patrician and plebeian gentes. The name gave rise to the patronymic gens Aulia, and perhaps also to gens Avilia and the cognomen Avitus. The name was usually abbreviated A., but occasionally Av. or Avl.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyGeorge Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897) For most of Roman history, Aulus was one of the ten most common praenomina, being less common than Titus, the sixth most common praenomen, and comparable in frequency to Gnaeus, Spurius, and Sextus. Origin and meaning The 4th century epitome De Praenominibus (Concerning Praenomina) by Julius Paris derives the name from the verb alo, to nourish. However, Chase argues that in no circumstances could the simple root of al- be transmuted into aul-. Another popular etymology derived the name from aula or olla, a palace, perhaps implying nobility, or from its homonym, aula or olla, a pot, presumably an affectionate reference to the size and shape of a healthy baby. Both of these are also probably examples of false etymology.De Praenominibus (epitome by Julius Paris) One of the most common Etruscan praenomina was Aule or Aules (also spelled Avle, Aveles, etc.), the Etruscan cognate of Aulus. Deecke argued that the name was originally Etruscan, deriving it from avile, found in the plural form (\\"years\\") in numerous funerary inscriptions. The name would then have been brought to Rome during its period of Etruscan domination in the 6th century BC. The reason why avile should give rise to a personal name is unclear. Deecke also believed that the Latin praenomen Spurius was of Etruscan origin.Wilhelm Deecke, Etruskische Forschungen und Studien Chase felt that this explanation looked too far afield for the source of Roman names, and, supported by Zimmermann, proposed that Aulus was derived from , \\"little grandfather,\\" a diminutive of . This analogy was based on similar diminutives in other languages, some of them meaning \\"uncle\\" (from Latin avunculus).A.

Originally it consisted of a \\"tube\\" of gunpowder surrounded by a waterproofed varnished jute \\"rope.\\" It replaced earlier and less reliable methods of igniting gunpowder blasting charges which had caused many injuries and deaths in the mining industry. The safety fuse burns at a rate of typically about 30 seconds per foot (1 second per cm). History Documented evidence suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers. Gunpowder did not reach Europe until the early 13th century, carried over from China by Middle Eastern traders and merchants along the old Silk Road. For three centuries gunpowder was primarily used for military warfare. It was not until 1574 that gunpowder was first introduced to the mining industry,. and it took until 1617 before it was first used in a large- scale mining operation‚Äîat Thillot in France. Sensitivity of gunpowder One of the problems miners faced when introducing gunpowder into their operations was that it was relatively easy to ignite when exposed to sparks, intense heat, or flames. The method used by miners to blast away rock involved drilling several holes across a rock face which would be filled with charges of gunpowder. In order to confine the gases produced on ignition, the gunpowder was confined within each shot hole by inserting a pointed rod known as a \\"needle\\" in the gunpowder-charged hole and then packing in soft clay and tamping it down to form a plug. The \\"needle\\" was then removed and replaced by a fuse. To prevent sparking, a copper needle and a non-metallic ramming rod, typically made from hickory, were used. If a spark was created the results could be disastrous to the work force, and this was a common occurrence. Miners and mine owners were aware of the dangers of the use of gunpowder in mining, as is evident in their instructions for handling the material. A mill in England preparing the material wrote in its instructions, \\"Whosoever is at Labour within or without the powder magazines should execute his commission in such a respectful and revered silence as is seemly in such a place where (unless the Almighty in his Grace keeps a protective hand over the Labour) the least lack of care may not alone cause the loss of life of all present, but may even in a moment transform this place as well as its surroundings into a heap of stone.\\" The other major problem concerned the intentional ignition of the gunpowder charges. To provide some protection from the blast and the fumes, a nominated miner ignited the far end of the fuse which was intended to burn at a known rate. The miners, therefore, knowing the length of the fuse, could estimate the delay between ignition of the fuse and the ignition of the main charges. However, early fuses, known as filled \\"quills\\", had a tendency to either burn irregularly, \\"flash off\\", or break‚Äîeither by separation or by \\"pinching\\" in the shot hole due to the tamping process. They could also be damaged allowing moisture in, which could cause them to smoulder instead of burn and introduce a long delay. If the main charge failed to ignite, this was known as a misfire or \\"hang fire\\", and the miners would need to wait before returning to the work face to set new fuses. Increasingly, miners in Cornwall in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were becoming badly injured as a result of suspecting that there had been a misfire and returning to the work face just as a smouldering damp quill ignited the gunpowder charges. William Bickford In 1831 English merchant William Bickford moved to the heart of the Cornish mining district near Camborne; where at Tuckingmill he developed the first practical and reliable means for igniting gunpowder when mining, the \\"Safety Fuze\\". After earlier attempts at developing a safer way had failed, Bickford had an insight while visiting his friend who was a ropemaker. While observing his friend winding cord together to generate a rope, Bickford believed he could adapt the same method towards developing a fuse. This was done with the help of his son-in-law George Smith and a working miner named Thomas Davey. Bickford invented a machine which would thread and weave two layers of jute yarn (a shiny vegetable fibre), spun in opposite directions, over a small \\"tube\\" of gunpowder, the whole of which would then be \\"varnished\\" with tar to waterproof the product. The outcome was the development of a fuse which when lit \\"the fire only travels along it slowly, rate of burning ... being about 30 seconds per foot.\\" Bickford had developed a fuse which would burn for a known length of time, depending on the length of the fuse. Bickford obtained a British Patent for his device (No. 6159 \\"Safety Fuze for Igniting Gunpowder used in Blasting Rocks, Etc\\") on 6 September 1831. It was originally called \\"The Patent Safety Rod\\" but its name was later changed to the \\"Safety Fuse\\". It was supplied as a \\"rope\\" of about diameter; and was sold at the time for about same price as its predecessor, quills, at three pence per fathom (6 ft, 1.8 m). Bickford also set up a partnership with Thomas Davey, who gained twenty five percent of the profits for the first fourteen years. Impact of the safety fuse A burning waterproof fuse Given the unreliability of fuses and means of detonation prior to Bickford's fuse, this new technology changed the safety and conditions of mining. Due to poor record keeping or lack thereof, it is relatively difficult to determine the exact number of mining accidents and related statistics prior to the invention of the safety fuse. However \\"this fuse soon replaced the less reliable fuses which were made of straws or quills filled with black powder, thus greatly reducing the hazard of accidental explosions in mining or construction.\\". Word of the reliability of Bickford's safety fuse spread, and was soon in large demand across world markets. Bickford's fuse not only dramatically improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but also contributed to the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a blast cap which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the blast cap and igniting the fuse, it will set the blast cap off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a blast cap into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the blast cap and producing a current which will travel from the source to the blast cap will also set off the dynamite.

Early life and training Neil Clerehan was born in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton on 29 December 1922. He developed an interest in architecture at an early age, encouraged by his parents who bought him a subscription to Australian Home Beautiful as his eleventh birthday present. Matriculating from St Patrick's College, East Melbourne and enrolled in 1940 in the architecture program at the Melbourne Technical College. After a stint in the army, where he met Robin Boyd, he resumed his studies at RMIT University in 1945, transferring in 1946 to the night-class Atelier course at Melbourne University. For most of 1946, he also worked in the office of Martin & Tribe. He then transferred to the new Bachelor of Architecture at Melbourne University, graduating in 1950, having already registered as an architect in 1949. Early works In 1946 he took over the editorship of Smudges, the monthly news sheet of the Architectural Students Society of the RVIA, from Robin Boyd, carrying on the championship of modern design. In 1947 he assisted Boyd with the seminal publication Victorian Modern, and the establishment of The Age's Small Homes Service, which provided low cost modern house designs, promoted through the newspaper. Clerehan helped provided house designs from the beginning, and ran the service in 1950-51 while Boyd was overseas. In 1949 he designed his first built project, a simple skillion roofed north facing house for a Brighton neighbour. He returned in early 1953, and took over directorship of the Small Homes Service from Boyd again, and restarted his solo architectural practice. Personal life He married Sonia Cole in 1955, their first home for a few months being a flat in Regents Court on Toorak Road, before moving to the glass-walled house he designed for his family in Fawkner Street, South Yarra. Architecture Clerehan described his style as that of \\"an unreconstructed Modernist\\". In 2010 he wrote that \\"architecture is a system rather than a style. I don't have a social conscience on the question of sustainability. I regard our building habits, especially of housing, as the antithesis of environmental empathy.\\"Doug Evans (ed). Architect Victoria, pp. 6-7 Contributed by Neil Clerehan. Official Journal of the Australian Institute of Architects, Victorian Chapter, Summer, 2010. Writing and Public Life Clerehan wrote and published continuously, championing good, modern design, through editorials and articles, starting with his editorship of Smudges in the 1940s, he went on to publish weekly columns in The Age as part of the Small Homes Service through the 1950s. In 1961, Clerehan assembled and edited Best Australian Houses 1961 for the RAIA, to promote the work of Institute members, \\"an astute summary of the leap Australian architecture had made in the 1950s.\\"Clerehan, Black, and Edquist (2005), The Architecture of Neil Clerehan, RMIT Publishing, Melbourne, Australia. In 1970, Clerehan provided a broad overview on Australian architecture in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. In 1971, following Boyd's death, he put together a special edition of the RAIA's journal Architect. Through the 1970s he was the local contributor to the United States journal Architecture Plus. He took an active interest in the new discipline of heritage in the 1970s, joining the Buildings Committee of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria), and served as chairman then president of the Council for the Historic Environment (1977‚Äì84). In the 1980s and 1990s, he was a member of the State Government's Historic Buildings Preservation Council. He also sat on bodies such as the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council and the Commission of Advanced Education. Harriet Edquist and Richard Black paid tribute to his architectural work and writings in The architecture of Neil Clerehan (2010). Notable works Clerehan's first house for his family, built in 1955, was a simple two storey flat roofed brick walled structure with the north face being entirely a then typical 1950s timber framed window wall. Unusually however, this was on an inner city block of Victorian villas, and stood out with its tall all-glass front set well back behind a tall brick fence. The front garden functioned as the main outdoor space, and the living rooms were on the first floor. While director of the Small Homes Service between 1953‚Äì61, as contributions from other architects dropped off, he designed many houses himself, approximately 130. They ranged widely from simple, rectangular, flat roofed modernist styles, to the more typically suburban low pitched gable roof L shape plan. It is not known how many of these were ultimately built, but the service sold hundreds of his plans during his tenure, and examples can be found throughout Melbourne's huge suburban areas developed in the 1950s and 1960s. From 1962-64 he was briefly in partnership with Guilford Bell, another notable practitioner of postwar modernist domestic design, and their first and major commission was the Simon House, a large single level beach house in bayside Mt Eliza. The house has a square symmetrical plan, a Bell signature, arranged around a large courtyard containing a pool. The expansive living area has full height windows both to the bay on one side, and courtyard on the other. It won the RVIA Single House Medal in 1964. In 1968, with a growing family, Clerehan designed a second house for himself, in Walsh Street, South Yarra, around the corner from the Fenner House, and on the same street as Boyd's 1958 family home. As described by architectural academic Prof Philip Goad, \\"This is typical Clerehan: understated, self-effacing and underestimating his own consummate skill in being able to provide an elegant backdrop to everyday life.\\" It remained his family home until his death in 2017. In the late 1960s, his efficiency in house planning led to a commission from Pettit & Sevitt, a Sydney-based project home builder. Pettit & Sevitt offered a wide range of plans to suit various sites and budgets in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, designed by noted architects such as Ken Woolley of Ancher Mortlock Murray & Wooley and Harry Seidler, all with a similar aesthetic of white board or bagged brick walls, flat or cathedral ceilings with exposed beams, and open plan living spaces with generous walls of glass opening onto decks and gardens. In 1969, in association with Ancher Mortlock Murray & Woolley, Clerehan designed the 3136 (a very efficiently planned small flat roofed three bedroom house, named for its 11 square size of 31x36 feet), which won the Project Home Award from the New South Wales chapter of the RAIA in both 1970 and 1971. The house was popular, reportedly selling three per week for a year, mostly in Sydney. In 1972, again with Ancher Mortlock Murray & Woolley, he designed an even smaller house, the 2937 (29 x 37 feet), which received the 1973 NSW Project Home Award.

From 1980 onward he was in partnership with David Cran as Clerehan Cran until Cran's death in 1996, when he resumed solo practice, continuing to work into his 90s. He continued to write, including obituaries of his contemporaries as he outlived them. In 2006, his work and life was the subject of the RMIT publication The Architecture of Neil Clerehan. By 2011, he was described as a \\"living treasure\\". Neil Clerehan died in November 2017, aged 94.

Established in 1971, FACT is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization that supports non-toxic, biologically sound alternative cancer therapies. FACT is the creator of the documentary film Rethinking Cancer and Web site RethinkingCancer.org. FACT's goal is to educate physicians and patients about a different concept of cancer and chronic degenerative conditions in the hope that the public will gain an understanding of all viable medical options.  Brief history  Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy, established in 1971, is the creator of the film Rethinking Cancer. They are a federally approved 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization. Ruth Sackman, featured in the film, was co-founder and president of FACT until her death in December 2008 at age 93. She organized the foundation after watching helplessly as her daughter, Arlene, diagnosed with acute leukemia in 1970, suffered through chemotherapy, becoming progressively weaker until succumbing to the disease. Ruth felt there had to be a better way and traveled the world to find it. For the next 37 years she helped hundreds of cancer patients in the U.S. and worldwide return to healthy lives, as well as educate many more about prevention and treatment of chronic disease. Ruth's yardstick for success was always long-term recovery, i.e., at least 10 years cancer-free. FACT's goal is to educate physicians and patients about a different concept of cancer and chronic degenerative conditions: whether dealing with breast cancer, lymphoma, Lyme disease ‚Äî it is a systemic disease. Tumors or abnormal cells are symptoms of a biochemical imbalance in the body, and that imbalance can be corrected with a well-designed, individualized metabolic program. A non-toxic, biologically sound program, focusing on the whole body and not just the tumor, can provide all the materials and conditions necessary to produce healthy cells and restore well being. The primary tools for a comprehensive, metabolic approach are 1) a balanced diet of whole, unprocessed, preferably organic foods and 2) detoxification, to efficiently relieve the body of toxins released into the bloodstream as the immune system becomes energized to do its work. Attention must also be paid to optimum function of all the body organs and glands, as well as skeletal integrity, hormonal balance, stress management..  Book and documentary film  ;Rethinking Cancer The book, authored by founder Ruth Sackman, was published in 2003. The book shifts the focus of the cancer discussion from the treatment of the symptoms to correcting the cause of the health breakdown in the body as a whole. The goal is not neoplasm (tumor) reduction, as in conventional protocols such as chemotherapy and radiation. Rather, the success in the long-term recovery of the patient, i.e., returning the body to as normal a state of health as possible. Rethinking Cancer covers all the aspects of a comprehensive program that can provide the body with the factors required for restoration and maintenance of optimum health. However, this book is not intended as a self-treatment handbook. Guidance by experienced practitioners is vital, though understanding the logic of a non-toxic treatment approach is the first step. The film of the same title is an educational documentary produced in 2009 that provides a rare look into the psychological and therapeutic journeys of five men and women who used biological therapies to overcome serious illness. In this documentary, four of the featured subjects had been diagnosed with cancer; two of these patients were considered terminal cases. The fifth patient had a severe case of Lyme disease. All five have outlived their diseases, between 15 and nearly 40 years, thus far.documentary trailer References  External links  *Rethinking cancer ‚Äî official site *Wanted-a-Rethink! *\\"Rethinking Cancer\\" ‚Äî 5 People Fight Cancer with Non-Toxic Alternative Methods, and Win (Weblog) *Five men and women tell the story of \\"Rethinking Cancer\\" Cancer charities in the United States Medical and health foundations in the United States Medical and health organizations based in New York (state) ","title":"Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy"},{"id":"25171876","text":"Roblin station is a railway station in Roblin, Manitoba, Canada.

It was endemic to the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in the Eastern United States, in Henderson and Polk counties. It was found primarily along gravelly and sandy bars along high-gradient rivers, and was presumably wiped out due to changes in this restricted habitat. It was last sighted in 1919. Marshallia grandiflora was an herb up to 90 cm (3 feet) tall. Most of the leaves were clustered around the base of the stem. One plant would produce one or two heads, each head containing pink disc flowers but no ray flowers.Flora of North America, Marshallia grandiflora Beadle & F. E. Boynton, 1901.

It is very small, reaching a total length of no more than 25 mm. The males have orange or amber wings. Both sexes have a red pterostigma. The eastern amberwing dragonfly is one of the only types of dragonfly that actively mimics a wasp. The yellow and brown stripes on its abdomen encourage predators to stay away. When perched, they will wiggle their abdomen and wings in a wasp-like fashion to deter other animals from eating it. Males have an elaborate courtship ritual. When a female approaches his territory, the male will lead her to his selected egg-laying site and hover above it with wings whirring and abdomen raised. The common name refers to its eastern range, although this dragonfly does extend westward well into the central part of the United States. The scientific name, tenera, means delicate and alludes to its small size.

Her husband was the target of criticism for rampant corruption during his regime.\\"Shamed By Their Nation\\", Time Magazine, 6 September 1993 She was credited with creating the position of First Lady of Nigeria and making it her own. As first lady, she launched many programmes to improve the life of women. The \\"Maryam Phenomenon\\" became a celebrity and \\"an icon of beauty, fashion and style\\", a position she retained after her husband's fall from power. Early years Maryam King was born in 1948 in Asaba (present-day Delta State), where she attended her primary education. Her parents were Hajiya Asabe Halima Mohammed from the present Niger State, a Hausa, and Leonard Nwanonye Okogwu from Asaba, an Igbo. She later moved north to Kaduna where she attended Queen Amina's College Kaduna for her Secondary education. She graduated as a secretary at the Federal Training Centre, Kaduna. Later she obtained a diploma in secretaryship from La Salle Extension University (Chicago, Illinois) and a Certificate in Computer Science from the NCR Institute in Lagos. On 6 September 1969, shortly before her 21st birthday, she married Major Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. They had four children, boys Mohammed and Aminu, and two girls, Aisha and Halima. After her husband became Chief of Army Staff in 1983, Maryam Babangida became President of the Nigerian Army Officers Wives Association (NAOWA). She was active in this role, launching schools, clinics, women's training centres and child day care centers. Her hobbies were gardening, interior decoration, music, squash, badminton, collecting birds, philanthropic activities and reading. First lady When her husband became head of state in 1985, Maryam Babangida moved with her children into Dodan Barracks in Lagos. She had to arrange for considerable renovations to make the rooms more suitable for formal receptions. Dodan barracks was one of the key locations seized in the April 1990 coup attempt by Gideon Orkar against Ibrahim Babangida, who was present in the barracks when the attack occurred, but managed to escape via a back route. As First Lady of Nigeria between 1985 and 1993, she turned the ceremonial post into a champion for women's rural development. She founded the Better Life Programme for Rural Women in 1987 which launched many co-operatives, cottage industries, farms and gardens, shops and markets, women‚Äôs centres and social welfare programs. The Maryam Babangida National Centre for Women's Development was established in 1993 for research, training, and to mobilize women towards self-emancipation. She championed women issues vigorously. She reached out to the first ladies of other African countries to emphasize the effective role they can play in improving the lives of their people. Her book, Home Front: Nigerian Army Officers and Their Wives, published in 1988, emphasized the value of the work that women perform in the home in support of their husbands, and has been criticized by feminists. Working with the National Council for Women's Societies (NCWS) she had significant influence, helping gain support for programmes such as the unpopular SFEM (Special Foreign Exchange Market) program to cut subsidies, and to devalue and fix the currency. She also established a glamorous persona. Talking about the opening of the seven-day Better Life Fair in 1990, one journalist said \\"She was like a Roman empress on a throne, regal and resplendent in a stone-studded flowing outfit that defied description...\\" Women responded to her as a role model, and her appeal lasted long after her husband fell from power. Illness and death On 15 November 2009, rumours circulated that the former first lady had died in her hospital bed at the University of California (UCLA) Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles over complications arising from terminal ovarian cancer. However, an aide to the former president, said \\"Mrs Maryam Babangida is alive ... I told her about the spreading rumour in Nigeria concerning her death and she laughed, saying those carrying the rumour would die before her.\\" Maryam died aged 61 from ovarian cancer on 27 December 2009 in a Los Angeles, California hospital. Her husband was at her side as she died. President of the Senate of Nigeria, David Mark, was said to have broken down into tears upon hearing the news. The Times of Nigeria reported on her death that she was \\"considered to be one of the greatest women in Africa today\\".

The brand is known primarily for its lawn and garden tools like trimmers, lawn mowers, and chainsaws. In North America, WORX products can be found at numerous major retailers including Lowe's, Walmart, The Home Depot, Canadian Tire, and Costco. The brand is also sold on other continents, such as in Europe. History The Positec Tool Corporation was founded in Suzhou, China, by Don Gao in 1994. For most of its early years, Positec sold OEM power tools to companies and brands like Black & Decker. Gao wanted to branch out by creating a line of lawn and garden equipment using his own branding. Positec launched early versions of WORX tools in China in 2004. One of the first WORX products sold was an electric lawn trimmer called the WORX GT. Also in 2004, Gao met Tom Duncan, an entrepreneur and former executive at Vermont American, a company owned by the Robert Bosch Tool Group of Germany. Duncan brought the Rockwell Tools brand name under the umbrella of Positec and became the head of the company's North American division in 2005. He would eventually sell both the WORX and Rockwell brands from the headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Positec initially had trouble selling WORX products to major retailers because those retailers wanted to sell them as an in-house brand (rather than an independent brand). In order to sell under the WORX brand name, the company decided to employ direct response marketing including the use of infomercials. The WORX GT electric trimmer was the first Positec product to be sold using an infomercial in the United States in early 2007. By the end of that year, the company had sold 313,000 WORX GT units. The first retailer in which WORX products appeared was Lowe's in October 2009. By 2012, the WORX brand was in Walmart, Costco, and The Home Depot (among others). Also in 2012, Positec's increased sales required the company to move its US distribution center from Long Beach, California to Huntersville, North Carolina to be closer to the headquarters in Charlotte. Products The WORX brand is composed of numerous lawn and garden tools. The brand's flagship product was the WORX GT, a lightweight electric trimmer. Updated iterations of the WORX GT continue to be made and sold by Positec. WORX is also known for selling items like lawn mowers and chainsaws. It offers cordless electric lawn mowers that run exclusively on battery power and have zero carbon emissions. In 2014, WORX released a fully robotic lawn mower (dubbed the \\"WORX Landroid\\") that will mow the lawn, returning to a charging station if the battery begins to run low. The Worx JawSaw is a chainsaw with a partially enclosed blade that is designed for safety. Other products include leaf blowers, yard carts, and other accessories. The WORX TriVac is a cordless electric leaf blower that doubles as a vacuum. The WORX AeroCart is a wheelbarrow-like yard cart that features 8 different functions. Recognition and awards In 2011, Positec was honored with the Product of the Year award by DIY Week in the garden tools category for the WORX TriVac leaf blower/vacuum and the Eco cordless lawn mower.

Due to its unique appearance, the genus has been dubbed the headless chicken fish, headless chicken monster, and the Spanish dancer. It is also known as the swimming sea cucumber, and some are called the pink see-through fantasia.  Description and characteristics  Species in this genus have developed webbed swimming fin like structures at the front and back of their bodies which enable them to swim up off the surface of the sea floor and to journey as much as up into the water column. This is thought to help the animals move to new feeding grounds and avoid predators.Miller, J. E.; Pawson, David L., Swimming Sea Cucumbers (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea): A Survey, with Analysis of Swimming Behavior in Four Bathyal Species, Smithsonian contributions to the marine sciences, no 35, 1990. The sea cucumber ranges in size from . Its most distinct feature is its coloring, which is dictated by size: small enypniastes are a bright pink, and larger individuals are a more reddish-brown color . It is also semi- transparent, and its intestine can be seen through its body, especially after feeding. The enypniastes have a round bulbous body, bifurcated tentacles, and a large anterior sail. They can also be bioluminescent.  Habitat  The enypniastes can be found mainly in the benthic zone of the ocean. They can be found all over the globe in many different regions. They spend most of their time in the water column, touching down on the seafloor only to eat. The first sighting in the southern ocean waters occurred in October 2018, when a team from Australia's Department of the Environment and Energy caught an image of E. eximia on a camera that had been deployed in seas near East Antarctica.  Feeding  The enypniastes feed mostly on benthic sediment. They feed by pushing food into their mouths with their tentacles. They feed very quickly, staying on the seafloor for at most sixty four seconds. Since that is most enough time to feed fully, the enypniastes feed episodically.  Movement  The enypniastes move using a few methods. The first is that they move their anterior veil in a rowing motion. The second is that when there is a current, the organism will use their tentacles to pull themselves down current. They also move using a pushing motion with their tentacles. Species Many species have been described in this genus, however they are now believed to be all synonyms of E. eximia: * Enypniastes eximia Th√©el, 1882 ‚Äî Pink swimming sea cucumber (only confirmed species to date) * Enypniastes atlanticus (Heding, 1940) * Enypniastes diaphana (Gilchrist, 1920) * Enypniastes ecalcarea (Sluiter, 1901) * Enypniastes obscura (Koehler & Vaney, 1905) Enypniastes sp. showing bioluminescence at a depth of 3200 metres Notes References http://zipcodezoo.com/Animals/E/Enypniastes_eximia/ *The Blue Planet - http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/blueplanet/factfiles/starfish_urchins/swimming_sea_cucumber_bg.shtml Holothuroidea genera Pelagothuriidae Taxa named by Johan Hjalmar Th√©el de:Enypniastes eximia ","title":"Enypniastes"},{"id":"25172565","text":"Silver's Serenade is an album by jazz pianist Horace Silver released on the Blue Note label in 1963 featuring performances by Silver with Blue Mitchell, Junior Cook, Gene Taylor, and Roy Brooks.Horace Silver discography accessed November 23, 2009.

Raw meat generally refers to any type of uncooked muscle tissue of an animal used for food. In the meat production industry, the term ‚Äòmeat‚Äô refers specifically to mammalian flesh, while the words ‚Äòpoultry‚Äô and ‚Äòseafood‚Äô are used to differentiate between the tissue of birds and aquatic creatures.Smil, Vaclav. ‚ÄúEating Meat: Evolution, Patterns, and Consequences.\\" pp. 599‚Äì639. Consumption of raw meat While the majority of meat is cooked before eating, some traditional dishes such as crudos, steak tartare, kibbeh nayyeh, sushi, sashimi, raw oysters, or other delicacies can call for uncooked meat. The risk of disease from ingesting pathogens found in raw meat is significantly low. Raw meat diseases Every year in the United States, 6.5 million to 33 million cases of illness are diagnosed due to microbial pathogens, with about 9,000 deaths occurring annually as well.Ahn, D. U., Jo, C., Olson, D.G. ‚ÄúAnalysis of volatile components and the sensory characteristics of irradiated raw pork.‚Äù pp. 209‚Äì215. According to a multi- state study published in the America Journal of Preventative Medicine, the annual cost of disease caused by food borne pathogens is estimated to be anywhere from 9.3 to 12.9 billion dollars in ‚Äúmedical costs and productivity losses.‚ÄùAltekruse, Sean F. DVM. \\"A multi-state survey of consumer food- handling and food-consumption practices.\\" pp. 216‚Äì221. Most of these diseases come from contact with contaminated raw meat, although other \\"vehicles of transmission\\" are becoming more and more frequent due to global travel.Duffy, Geraldine et al. ‚ÄúA review of quantitative microbial risk assessment in the management of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef.‚Äù pp. 76‚Äì88. Other sources of disease-causing pathogens can include, but are not limited to: lettuce, sprouts, fruit juices, vegetables, raw milk and water. However, the main source of disease caused by microbial pathogens is usually raw meat.Duffy, Geraldine et al. ‚ÄúA review of quantitative microbial risk assessment in the management of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef.‚Äù pp. 76‚Äì88.

Beef, poultry and seafood There are many disease-carrying pathogens found in raw meats, and they differ according to the source, whether it be mammalian, poultry or seafood. Some disease-carrying pathogens found in beef are Salmonellas, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes.Duffy, Geraldine et al. ‚ÄúA review of quantitative microbial risk assessment in the management of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef.‚Äù pp. 76‚Äì88.Myint, M.S. et al. ‚ÄúThe effect of pre-enrichment protocol on the sensitivity and specificity of PCR for detection of naturally contaminated Salmonella in raw poultry compared to conventional culture.‚Äù pp. 599‚Äì604.Scanga, J.A et al. ‚ÄúMicrobiological contamination of raw beef trimmings and ground beef.‚Äù pp. 145‚Äì152.

Seafood itself can also contain a wide variety of pathogens. The most common pathogen in raw oysters is Vibrio gastroenteritis, while Salmonella, Plesiomonsas shielloides, and staphylococcus are found in contaminated raw shrimp, and Vibrio cholerae has been found in raw crabmeat.Altekruse, S. F. et al. ‚ÄúVibrio Gastroenteritis in the US Gulf of Mexico Region: The Role of Raw Oysters.‚Äù pp. 489‚Äì495.Wallace, Barbara J. MD et al. ‚ÄúSeafood-associated disease outbreaks in New York, 1980‚Äì1994.‚Äù pp. 48‚Äì54. Many of the symptoms that result from these diseases involve intestinal damage and can have potentially fatal effects for those at risk. The symptoms of an E. coli infection include bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and possible complications for the immune-compromised, elderly or children. These complications can include Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and neurological problems.Duffy, Geraldine et al. ‚ÄúA review of quantitative microbial risk assessment in the management of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef.‚Äù pp. 76‚Äì88.

F. et al. ‚ÄúVibrio Gastroenteritis in the US Gulf of Mexico Region: The Role of Raw Oysters.‚Äù pp. 489‚Äì495. While most of these diseases are still most commonly found in raw meat, the instances of detection in other mediums are increasing.Duffy, Geraldine et al. ‚ÄúA review of quantitative microbial risk assessment in the management of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef.‚Äù pp. 76‚Äì88.

According to a study published in the Journal of Food Safety on consumer attitudes and awareness of disease, most outbreaks of food borne illnesses result from ‚Äúcontaminated raw foods, cross-contamination, insufficient cooking, inadequate cooling or a lapse of more than 12 hours between preparing and eating.‚ÄùSammarco, M.L., Ripabelli G., Grasso, G.M. ‚ÄúConsumer Attitude and Awareness towards Food-relate Hygienic Hazards.‚Äù pp. 215‚Äì221. The study focused on habits of consumers in the kitchen with preparing raw meat. According to the results, 14% did not wash utensils or dishes between using them for raw and cooked foods, and 75% were unaware of the risks of storing raw meat on upper levels of refrigerators and the risk of cross-contamination below.Sammarco, M.L., Ripabelli G., Grasso, G.M. ‚ÄúConsumer Attitude and Awareness towards Food-relate Hygienic Hazards.‚Äù pp. 215‚Äì221. The instances of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis have increased in the past decade, according to the study, most frequently because of the ‚Äúimproper handling of foods by consumers and food service workers.‚ÄùSammarco, M.L., Ripabelli G., Grasso, G.M. ‚ÄúConsumer Attitude and Awareness towards Food- relate Hygienic Hazards.‚Äù pp. 215‚Äì221. Data gathered in a multi-state survey in 1999 found that out of 19,356 adults interviewed: 19% did not wash hands or cutting boards after handling raw meat, 20% ate pink hamburgers often, 50% ate undercooked eggs on a regular basis, 8% had raw oysters habitually, and 1% drank unpasteurized milk. These behaviors increase the risk of acquiring Salmonellas, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio gastroenteritis, and Escherichia coli.Altekruse, Sean F. DVM. ‚ÄúA multi-state survey of consumer food-handling and food-consumption practices.‚Äù pp. 216‚Äì221. Meat inspection/regulation History of U.S. federal meat inspection/regulation The first instance of federal regulation of the meat industry occurred in 1890, when European markets began questioning the quality of American beef. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was given the power to make sure European standards were met, and in 1891 could inspect slaughtered livestock to be sold in the United States.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. The momentum for the creation of meat regulation laws in the 20th century was spurred by the publication of The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair. Published in 1906, this expos√© described the horrible and unsanitary conditions of the Chicago slaughterhouses and caused a public outcry for change.Smil, Vaclav. ‚ÄúEating Meat: Evolution, Patterns, and Consequences.\\" pp. 599‚Äì639. The Federal government authorized the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) in 1906 as a response. It ‚Äúestablished sanitary standards for slaughter‚Äù and ‚Äúmandated antemortem inspection of animals‚Ä¶and postmortem inspection of every carcass.‚ÄùHulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. Another stipulation was that government inspectors must be in every meat production facility.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. This law did not originally cover poultry, just beef and meat from other mammals, because poultry was not being mass-produced in the early 20th century.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. The federal meat inspection programs continued to be revised throughout the 20th century, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, in light of studies that showed more dangers not yet addressed.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. The current rule used by the FSIS, or Food Safety and Inspection Services, was published in 1996 and known as HACCP. This stands for the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Systems. It was originally developed by the Pillsbury Company to ensure the safety of food used by the U.S. space program, and later adopted and modified by the federal government.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. The HACCP‚Äôs goal is to: reduce the risk of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of meat and poultry products to the maximum extent possible by ensuring that appropriate and feasible measures are taken at each step in the food-production process where hazards can enter and where procedures and technologies exist or can be developed to prevent the hazard or reduce the likelihood it will occur.Hulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. According to an article on the HACCP system published in Risk Analysis, the seven principles of implementing a HACCP system are: #‚ÄúConduct a hazard analysis. #Identify the CCP‚Äôs (critical control points) in the process #Establish critical limits for preventative measures associated with each identified CCP. #Establish CCP monitoring requirements and procedures for using monitoring results to adjust processes and maintain control. #Establish corrective actions to be taken when monitoring indicates that there is a deviation from an established critical limit. # Establish effective recordkeeping procedures that document the HACCP plan. #Establish procedures to verify that the HACCP system is working correctly.‚ÄùHulebak, K.L.; Schlosser,W. ‚ÄúHACCP History and Conceptual Overview.‚Äù pp. 547‚Äì552. These measures try to ensure that the system is effective, reducing the risk of harmful pathogens sickening the public. Current U.S. meat regulations/programs There are many federal laws and programs in place to attempt to lower the rates of food borne infection. They cover a wide variety of issues, including regulation of meat production (with specific quality standards) and programs to help educate the public about food safety. One such program, The National Food Safety Initiative (FSI) was launched in 1997 and focused on ‚Äúimproving data on pathogens, coordinating regulatory responses, consumer educational efforts and behavioral surveillance.‚ÄùAltekruse, Sean F. DVM. ‚ÄúA multi-state survey of consumer food-handling and food-consumption practices.‚Äù pp. 216‚Äì221. Industry efforts to lessen the spread of disease include milk pasteurization, ‚Äúsanitary controls‚Äù on farms, and the development of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP).Altekruse, Sean F. DVM. ‚ÄúA multi-state survey of consumer food-handling and food-consumption practices.‚Äù pp. 216‚Äì221. The Critical Control Point, or CCP, according to a study published in the Journal of Food Safety in 2004, is ‚Äúa point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied, and as a result, a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.‚ÄùIngham, Steven C., Losinski, Jill A., Becker, Katie L. ‚ÄúGrowth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Serovars on Raw Beef, Pork, Chicken, Bratwurst and Cured Corned Beef: Implications for HACCP Plan Critical Limits.‚Äù pp. 246‚Äì256. Food ‚Äúprocessors must use CCP critical limits that have been scientifically validated‚Äù to prevent the growth of pathogens.Ingham, Steven C., Losinski, Jill A., Becker, Katie L. ‚ÄúGrowth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Serovars on Raw Beef, Pork, Chicken, Bratwurst and Cured Corned Beef: Implications for HACCP Plan Critical Limits.‚Äù pp. 246‚Äì256. Specifically for meat, since pathogens grow in warmer temperatures, the CCP is related to the time and temperature meat is allowed to remain. As of 2004, the maximum ‚Äúregulatory limit‚Äù for poultry during production was 13 degrees Celsius.Ingham, Steven C., Losinski, Jill A., Becker, Katie L. ‚ÄúGrowth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Serovars on Raw Beef, Pork, Chicken, Bratwurst and Cured Corned Beef: Implications for HACCP Plan Critical Limits.‚Äù pp. 246‚Äì256. Detection of pathogens There are a variety of methods used to detect and kill pathogens. The most effective, as expected, is to cook the meat to a high enough temperature to kill all growth, but meat can be re- contaminated during any step of the food production process, especially if workers handle both raw and cooked products.Li Y., Zhuang S., Mustapha A. ‚ÄúApplication of a multiplex PCR for the simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Shigella in raw and ready-to-eat meat products.‚Äù pp. 402‚Äì406. The risk of disease from a ready-to-eat (RTE) product such as chicken nuggets is significantly higher due to the fact that many consumers do not re-cook them, believing them to be safe. E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella have all been found in RTE products.Myint, M.S. et al. ‚ÄúThe effect of pre- enrichment protocol on the sensitivity and specificity of PCR for detection of naturally contaminated Salmonella in raw poultry compared to conventional culture.‚Äù pp. 599‚Äì604. A study of working practices in shops selling raw meats (including butcher‚Äôs shops, supermarkets and general stores) published in the Journal of Hygiene, found pathogens on slicing machines, wiping cloths, worker‚Äôs hands, towels, and nail brushes. This facilitated the contamination of already cooked meats.Tebbutt, G.M. ‚ÄúAn Evaluation of Various Working Practices in Shops Selling Raw and Cooked Meats.‚Äù pp. 81‚Äì90. This example shows the need of a method of detection. The traditional method is based on using cultures examined under a microscope, which is time-consuming. A method tested in 2005 in a study published in Meat Science, is called multiplex PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and is based on the analyzing of nucleic acid and had promising results.Myint, M.S. et al. ‚ÄúThe effect of pre-enrichment protocol on the sensitivity and specificity of PCR for detection of naturally contaminated Salmonella in raw poultry compared to conventional culture.‚Äù pp. 599‚Äì604.

It was installed on the Wisconsin Avenue bridge in September 1997. The story of her heroic efforts to hatch six ducklings became an inspiration for many war-weary Americans near the end of World War II. Gertie's story unfolded as a daily serial in the local newspaper for 37 days, captivating the residents of Milwaukee, the state and eventually the country.Sandin, Jo. \\"Home Sweet Home\\". The Milwaukee Journal, March 31, 1995. History Gertie's story began in April 1945 when Milwaukee Journal outdoor writer Gordon MacQuarrie reported that a mallard duck was nesting on a wood piling under the Wisconsin Avenue bridge.Bauer, Fran. \\"Gertie co-author remembers famous fowl\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 1, 1997, p. B3. A total of nine eggs were laid and the duck kept vigil atop her nest despite throngs of visitors and motorists stopping on the bridge daily to check the progress of the expectant mother. Mother's Day cards began arriving for the mallard, the Boy Scouts formed a Gertie Patrol and a Wisconsin Humane Society officer was stationed to watch the brood as six of the nine eggs eventually produced chicks.Gould, Whitney. \\"Mallard memorialized Gertie, City's Famed duck gets statue in her honor\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 25, 1997 Final, p. B1. Public interest continued to swell as wire services picked up MacQuarrie's stories. Gertie and her nest were photographed by the Journal and local rival Milwaukee Sentinel, featured in Life Magazine and even had a front-page story in the United Kingdom's Daily Express.\\"Mallard's Fame Spans Sea for Story in London\\". The Milwaukee Journal, June 14, 1945, p. A1. Readers Digest ran a story on Gertie entitled \\"The Duck That Made Milwaukee Famous\\".Johnson, Don L. \\"'Millie' Finds City Life Just Ducky\\". Milwaukee Sentinel, May 28, 1980 Final, p. A1. Despite flooding, storms and fire on some nearby pilings, five ducklings and Gertie survived the ordeal and were put on public display in the nearby Gimbels department store windows, where more than 2 million visitors peered in to see the famous feathered family. The ducks were later relocated to the Juneau Park lagoon on Milwaukee's lakefront. Popular culture A promotional still for \\"Gertie the Great\\"The first book based on Gertie's story was \\"The Story of 'Gertie'\\", published by the Journal in July 1945 and based on its daily coverage. The book sold out three printings\\"'Gertie' Books Sold Out\\". The Milwaukee Journal, July 15, 1945, p.

It was produced by Ross Robinson and released in 1993. The demo is a rarity, but finished versions of the songs appeared on subsequent Korn albums. Background Before Korn even developed a name, they had moved into a small house together in Huntington Beach, California, south of Los Angeles, where they began working on songs. Later they rented a studio from Jeff Creath, the same person who let lead singer Jonathan Davis live in his garage. The studio was called \\"Underground Chicken Sound\\". While they were recording at Underground Chicken Sound, a group of people had been loitering around outside the studio. The band began playing a prelude to a later song, \\"Clown\\". When they began playing the song's riffs, a larger crowd gathered around, liking Korn's sound. Bassist Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu said it was because it sounded so \\"different\\". The band name is derived from a fan suggestion, \\"Corn\\", which the group initially rejected, but later settled on for a lack of better ideas. Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a \\"K\\" instead of a \\"C\\", and a backwards \\"R\\" so the band's name would appear as \\"Ko–Øn\\". The logo was designed by lead vocalist Jonathan Davis. Silveria explained, \\"the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool.\\" The demo's title refers to the artist, Neidermayer, who drew the cassette's cover. Although it was released without a proper title, it eventually became known as \\"Neidermayer's Mind\\" by fans and collectors. https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xruush Music and structure The demo version of \\"Daddy\\", is shorter in length (4:29), than the album version (9:35). The demo does not feature the a cappella intro; it starts immediately with Fieldy's bass riff. It also has a different chorus. After the instrumental bridge, there is an extra part to the song with Jonathan Davis singing: \\"Mommy! Why did Daddy touch me there?\\" which leads into \\"I didn't touch you there.\\" Unlike the official version of the song, \\"Daddy\\" was played live on three separate occasions. The demo version of \\"Blind\\" has a noticeably shorter bridge and many other changes. \\"Predictable\\" has a slightly higher key than the version featured on their debut album. The songs \\"Blind\\" and \\"Daddy\\" appeared in Sexart before they were re-recorded with Korn. \\"Daddy\\" was originally titled \\"Follow Me\\". \\"Alive\\" was scrapped with several of its sections reworked into the song \\"Need To\\", from the band's first album. A proper reworking of \\"Alive\\" appeared on Korn's sixth album Take a Look in the Mirror, over a decade after the demo. With this demo, Korn created and pioneered the nu metal sound, riffs, and rhythm. A key component of their sound was the use of seven-string guitars. Reception Neidermayer's Mind had a limited printing, and was not well received. It was released to record companies and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with Biohazard and House of Pain.

He is best known for resigning from the post of borough president for his involvement in a corruption scandal, upon which he fled the country in 1908. Bermel was born in Brooklyn, but by 1882 he had moved to Middle Village in Queens and established a stone cutting business, making cemetery monuments. He quickly became involved in politics, and in the 1890s was town supervisor in Newtown. When Queens consolidated with New York City in 1898, Bermel pursued appointments at the borough level. He became an ally of early machine politician Joseph Cassidy and served as his Commissioner of Public Works when Cassidy was elected Borough President. In 1905, Cassidy was seeking a third term as Borough President, but Bermel had his own plans for the office. He announced his own candidacy, running on a fusion ticket under the Republican and Independence League parties. He beat his former boss and became Borough President in 1906, vowing to fight \\"graft in every form.\\" Bermel proved to be almost as effective as Cassidy in wielding political power, and was quickly suspected of corruption. Bermel was largely responsible for the city's purchase of land for the creation of Kissena Park in Flushing. The city paid much more than fair market value for the property, which was held by friends of Bermel. A grand jury investigation ensued, and Governor Charles Evans Hughes appointed civil service reformer Samuel H. Ordway to investigate on April 28, 1908.Public Papers of Governor, State Printers (New York), 1909, p. 194 Bermel was scheduled to give testimony in the case on May 1, but he resigned as borough president on April 30. It was rumored that he was planning to flee the country the following day on the ocean liner Slavonia, so the district attorney served a subpoena requiring him to testify. He gave testimony in the morning, but was given permission to leave upon his promise to return by 2 o'clock that afternoon at the courthouse in Long Island City. By 12:02 pm, an hour after he promised to return, he was at the docks boarding the ship and heading for Rome. In his parting statement to the press, he said \\"I have nothing to say except to leave good luck for my friends and enemies alike.\\" On August 4, 1908, just three months after he fled to Europe, Bermel returned to New York. The Queens County District Attorney declared that \\"nothing of a criminal nature was pending\\" against Bermel. Bermel never faced charges stemming from his time in office. He died in Carlsbad, Czechoslovakia in 1921.

It was purchased and completed by the Halifax and Southwestern Railway in 1906. A portion of the line remained in operation until 1983. Route The line's eastern terminus was in Middleton, where it connected with the Dominion Atlantic Railway running between Halifax and Yarmouth, and also with the Nova Scotia Central Railway running from Middleton south to Bridgewater and Lunenburg. Running westward from Middleton, the Middleton and Victoria Beach line never actually ran as far as Victoria Beach, but made its western terminus in Port Wade where a quarter-mile wharf was built for loading and unloading of freight. This continued to be used even after the railway stopped running. The line of the railway ran along the north side of the Annapolis River closer to the North Mountain and the farms there than was the Dominion Atlantic line. The two railways more or less parallelled each other between Middleton and Bridgetown. West of Bridgetown the Dominion Atlantic crossed a bridge to the south side of the Annapolis River while the Middleton and Victoria Beach line continued along the northern side of the river from Bridgetown west to Port Wade. Incorporation The earliest variant of the company was the Granville and Victoria Beach Railway Company.Statutes of Nova Scotia 1891, chapter 126. The incorporators (those listed as the first members of the company) included forestry operators, merchants and lawyers from along the proposed route. This was a common way to get political support for the necessary legislative charter each railway had to have in order to qualify for the provincial construction grant, to allow it to expropriate its right of way (which it actually owned)Statutes of Nova Scotia, Railways Act and to permit it to cross highways. This railway was intended to run west from Bridgetown rather than from Middleton. A second attempt to get the railway started was the Granville and Victoria Beach Railway and Development Company.Statutes of Nova Scotia 1897, chapter 82 The incorporation was extended in 1899. The 1897 Act had provided that the Act would cease if work had not been completed within two years. Then there was another extension in 1901, when the name of the company was changed to the Middleton and Victoria Beach Railway Company.Statutes of Nova Scotia 1901, chapter 160 At this time the eastern end of the railway was shifted east from Bridgetown to Middleton, possibly because the promoters were afraid to trust their only rail connection to the outside world to the Dominion Atlantic, but also because the railway to Bridgewater had been completed. At about this time the railway plans were approved and filed in the registry of deeds, which constituted the expropriation.See plans in the Annapolis County Registry of Deeds, Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia The municipalities along the way, the Municipality of the County of Annapolis and the Town of Bridgetown, obtained legislative sanction to pay for the railway right of way, what was then referred to as railway damages. That was their contribution to what was generally seen as a valuable economic engine. Purchase and Completion The railway was acquired by the Halifax and South Western Railway in 1905.The sale was completed July 28, 1903 (see New York Times, July 29, 1903) but the necessary statutory authority was not confirmed until 1905. The construction had not been completed, and the H&SW; had to finish the job. MacKenzie and Mann, who were expanding the Canadian Northern in Nova Scotia, owned the H&SW;, which had acquired the Nova Scotia Central and built a railway into Halifax from Bridgewater. The provincial government fixed the length of the line at forty miles (64 kilometers) for purposes of the subsidy. Operation The railway eventually became part of Canadian Government Railways, and then Canadian National Railways. The railway was used for various agricultural and forest products, but its most important through cargo was iron from the mines at Torbrook, which was shipped from the Port Wade wharf. Abandonment About 1928The first CNR leases of parts of the railbed date from about this time. traffic stopped west of Bridgetown and a wye west of Bridgetown station allowed trains to turn to go back to Middleton or Bridgewater. The line from Middleton to Bridgetown was abandoned in 1983.

Born in Timonium, Maryland, he went to Dulaney High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, and attended Duke University. He represented the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where he ran the 1500 metres. He is still the Duke record holder at the mile (indoor), the 1500 metres (outdoor), and the 1000 metres (indoor), records he ran between 1971 and 1973. College career Wheeler attended Duke between 1971 and 1973. He won the 1,000-yard run at the 1971 NCAA Indoor Championships (his 2:07.4 was an NCAA championship record until 1976 p. 285.) and was ACC Champion in the mile in 1971 and 1973, with winning times of 4:05.9 and 4:03.2. p. 106. He won ACC titles in cross country and indoor and outdoor track. In 1971, he won the 1000 metres event at the Millrose Games, the oldest athletics invitational in the United States, and at least until 2004 was the only Duke athlete to win at the Millrose Games. Wheeler is still the fastest miler in Duke history, having run 3:39.00 on the 1500 metres outdoor in 1972. His indoor record of 4:00.70, which he set in 1973, is a full second faster than the second-best Duke time, 4:02.06, run by Ryan McDermott in 2011. He also holds the Duke record at 1000 metres indoor at 2:22.20 (1971) and the record in the 4x mile relay at 16:22.34 (1973), and has the second-best time at the 800 metres outdoor at 1:47.70 (1972). In 2002 he was voted, as one of 50, into the ACC's 50th anniversary team for indoor track and field. In November 25, 2010, he died in Mountain View, California, at the age of 58. 1972 Olympic appearance Qualifiers for the 1500 metres race at the Olympics were held at the 1972 United States Olympic Trials (track and field) in Eugene, Oregon. On the first day in Oregon, Wheeler impressed with the best time, 3:42.7, though favorite Jim Ryun went on to win the title. Before the actual Olympics started, there was considerable controversy over the proposed participation of Southern Rhodesia; in the weeks before the Olympics, a number of African countries (including Kenya, home of later 1500 metres Gold medal winner Kip Keino) threatened to withdraw from the event. The American track and field delegation composed a statement asking the International Olympic Committee to reconsider their decision to invite the former British colony; Wheeler spoke out in support of the African athletes who threatened to withdraw: \\"Everyone is in sympathy with this situation. It's going to be a matter of individual conscience what each is going to do.\\" In Munich, Wheeler reached the semifinals in the 1500 metres, a competition which proved disastrous for the American delegation after Jim Ryun, one of America's best milers ever, fell during qualifications. Like Dave Wottle, the other remaining American, Wheeler failed to make it through his heat; it was the first time since 1956, and only the second time ever, that the 1500 final was run without an American in it.

After graduating in 1908, Garey served in the army until 1923. His service included World War I, in which he led a combat patrol that penetrated enemy lines and returned with four prisoners without casualties.

President of St.John's College In 1923 Garey became president of his alma mater, St. John's, narrowing the military scope of the college so students could concentrate on getting a bachelor's degree. He abolished compulsory military training, replacing the cadet corps with a voluntary ROTC.\\"Annapolis, past to present: Military life at St. John's\\" (Accessed April 26, 2013). In September 1924 Garey brought the nation's first Naval Reserve program to St. John's as a pilot program to test the scheme for the Navy. (The US Naval Academy in Annapolis would not begin issuing bachelor's degrees until 1933.)\\"From Our Archive: The Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps by Capt. Chester W. Nimitz, USN 1928\\" (Accessed April 26, 2013) Program graduates were appointed as ensigns in the Naval Reserve. This initial program's success was enough to convince the Navy to establish six full-scale NROTC programs at Northwestern, Harvard, Yale, UC Berkeley, the University of Washington and Georgia Institute of Technology in 1926. Thus, the 1924-25 catalog was correct in saying, \\"This is the only college at which such a unit is maintained. In the future there will be many other colleges having such a course, but St. John's has the honor of being the first.\\" Maryland Police Force In 1926, though, Garey left St. John's and the voluntary ROTC program folded. By 1929 the Naval Reserve unit and Department of Naval Science had also disappeared due to lack of interest, despite the longevity of the six regular programs that had succeeded the St. John's College experiment (which all still exist in 2013, albeit with significant historical gaps at Harvard and Yale). After St. John's, Garey became involved in the Maryland Police Force. One of his most memorable experiences was on February 8, 1936. He and some other members of his police force attempted to deliver food to the people of Tangier Island during a terrible ice and snow storm. While attempting to deliver the food, fellow Sergeant William V.

The mission and responsibility of this unit include the commencement of rescue mission in a difficult underwater situation, rescuing accident victims at sea, and searching ships tactically in the event this is required. In addition, the STAR also share the role of the rapid reaction force together with the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) PASKAL and Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) UNGERIN on piracy, terrorism and robbery threats at sea before the arrival of RMP's Marine Operations Force, MMEA and RMN reinforcements.  History  Established in April 2005, a handful of Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) PASKAU and RMN PASKAL commandos are transferred into the MMEA to make up the first STAR team. The concept of MMEA Special Operations is based on the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Safety and Security Team (MSST) and Maritime Security Response Team (MSRT). In April 2008, twenty-five home-grown trainees successfully completed the MMEA Basic Commando Course Orientation held at Pulau Indah, Selangor. This included one senior commissioned officer, three senior non-commissioned officers (SNCO), and one non-commissioned officer (NCO). Trainees attending this course were selected from a STAR team selection test which was held from 19 to 24 December 2007. In July 2009, 24 trainees manage to pass the RMAF Basic Commando Course and thus forming pioneer team of home-grown STAR operators. According to Deputy Director Chief of Malaysian Maritime Operations VAdm. (M) Dato' Noor Aziz Yunnan, the team needed an additional 200 members by the end of the year.  National Special Operations Force  In 2016, main counter-terrorism operators in Malaysia are formed into one special operations task force.

Preparatory Course (4 weeks)  Lasts for one month, in the year 2011, this preparatory course was held in the RMAF Kuala Lumpur Airbase and has been overseen by instructors from PASKAU and STAR. It is a standard orientation among Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) Special Forces to weed out the weak and unprepared candidates before proceeding to the next stage of training. It follows the standards set up by MAF Special Forces (PASKAU, PASKAL, 21 GGK). In the present day, the STAR runs their own orientation training at MMEA's Base, Station and Academy. Overseen by veteran STAR instructors, the training is now known as Kursus Pra Asas Komando STAR ('STAR Pre-Basic Commando Course'). During the orientation course implementation, each candidate had to pass three tests which are: * Test 1 ‚Äì Physical Test (Water) * Test 2 ‚Äì Physical Test (Land) * Final Test ‚Äì Fitness Test  The fitness test consist of run under 30 minutes, freestyle swimming under 10 minutes, sidestroke swimming under 12 minutes, and mixstyle swimming under 12 minutes.  Pre-Basic Commando Course (2 weeks)  The objective of this course is to expose and prepare candidates before sending them to the Basic Commando Course held within the three branches of the MAF. This course lasts for two weeks in Teluk Batik, Lumut, Perak and overseen by instructors from PASKAL and STAR. During this course, trainees will be taught how to build up mental and physical strength and the esprit de corps for the upcoming Basic Commando Course. Trainees also exposed with basic small arms operation, map reading, compass and protractor reading, basic unarmed combat, swimming, long- distance running, navigation, survival effort, and basic marksman training. Training also included first aid, interrogation resistance, and amphibious assault.  Intensive Training (3 weeks)  This three weeks training is especially to waterborne special forces such as STAR and PASKAL. Trainees who pass the Pre-Basic Commando Course will be trained in the physical aspect of land and water. This training is the final selection process before trainees sent to the Basic Commando Course. Trainees need to pass two fitness test and one 'drown-proofing' test: * Fitness Test (Land)  run under 34 minutes, 50 push-ups under 90 seconds. 50 sit-ups under 90 seconds, rope climbing etc. * Fitness Test (Water)  freestyle swimming under 10 minutes, sidestroke swimming under 12 minutes and mixstyle swimming under 12 minutes, dive to pool bottom, dive across pool and diving from platform. * 'Drown-proofing' Test  swim across, 15 minutes float and dive to pool bottom; all with arms and legs tied.  Basic Commando Course (12 weeks)  Lasts for 12 weeks, STAR candidate will be sent to either RMN Basic Commando Course at RMN Naval Base in Lumut, Perak or RMAF Basic Commando Course at RMAF Regiment Jugra, Selangor. Both RMN and RMAF Commando School is nearby to MMEA Station in Lumut (MD3) and Port Klang (MD4). In Basic Commando Course, trainees will get through five phases which is: * Phase 1 ‚Äì Camp Phase (5 weeks) * Phase 2 ‚Äì Jungle Phase (2 weeks) * Phase 3 ‚Äì Swamp Phase and Long Range March (1 week) * Phase 4 ‚Äì Sea Phase (2 weeks) * Phase 5 ‚Äì Escape and Evasion (E&E;) (2 weeks) After graduation, trainees will be bestowed with berets according to the commando school they have entered. Either Maya blue beret for RMAF Commando School, or Magenta beret for RMN Commando School. At this point, the trainees are considered as an unofficial member of the STAR Team.  Special Task Introduction Course (6 weeks)  Once finished the 12 weeks Basic Commando Course, each trainee needs to complete a six weeks Kursus Pengenalan Tindakan Khas ('Special Task Introduction Course') held by the MMEA. During the course, trainees will be exposed to weapon handling, tower training, helicopter-borne training, land and water navigation, survivability and other special operations skills. In the closing ceremony, trainees will be bestowed with the red beret and STAR's insignia as a symbol that they are officially accepted into the elite unit.  Advanced Training  As a special operations force, the STAR operators will be sent to advance training held by the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) training centre. On 14 November 2009, 25 operators from the STAR team took part in joint training exercises with 11 operators from PASKAL Alpha Team. They trained in close quarters combat and ship boarding and rescue, on board the KD Panglima Hitam, at the RMN Naval Base in Lumut Perak. These exercises were conducted to test whether STAR members were able to perform their duties and responsibilities.

The ship, MT Tanker MGT1, had 14 crew members, all of them is Siamese, carried around 2.2 million litres of diesel with an estimated value of 7 million ringgit (1.66 million US dollars) when it disappeared from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) on Wednesday afternoon. It was on its way from Thailand to deliver fuel to Johor. The MMEA received a report from a local fisherman who spotted the pirates on a smaller boat boarding the Thai vessel ‚Äì MT Tanker MGT1 ‚Äì about three nautical miles from Yu Besar Island. STAR team was deployed to launch a rescue mission. The team departed for the tanker's last known location via helicopter but when they arrived, found the tanker missing. The boat was spotted near the tanker by a surveillance aircraft, warning shots were fired from the aircraft when the boat tried to escape but the attempt to stop them failed as the aircraft was running low on fuel. A team stormed the tanker, off the coast of Terengganu and arrested 10 pirates. Following the arrest of the pirates and their subsequent interrogation, Malaysian authorities arrested the mastermind, an Indonesian in his 50s, at a hotel in Johor Bahru at noon.  MT Lee Bo robbery  :1 June 2018 - 14 pirates were arrested aboard MT Bright by a STAR team, 25 nautical miles off the coast of Mersing within Malaysian waters during a pre-dawn raid. Before the arrest, command centre reported that the pirates were robbing a Mongolian-registered merchant vessel, MT Lee Bo, and took all the crew's personal items but failed to rob the cargo as the ship was empty. Following this, KM Sebatik ship was tasked to trail Lee Bo and gather more information on the pirates. Upon reaching the ship, Sebatik crew found 12 ship crews on board the ship and the vital information that the pirates were using machetes as a weapon and their last seen position. Information was relayed to the command centre, and a team of seven STAR members were scrambled using AW139 helicopters to track the pirates. The pirates' ship was identified as MT Bright, and the STAR team rappelled down from their helicopter and arrested all 14 on board. During interrogation, details on the mastermind were spilt by the pirates, and MMEA strategic partner, the Indonesian Western Fleet Quick Response - Angkatan Laut (WFQR-AL) were alerted and they managed to arrest two masterminds at Batam, Indonesia.

Lash of the American Student Union before the Dies Committee, 1939. The American Student Union (ASU) was a national left- wing organization of college students of the 1930s, best remembered for its protest activities against militarism. Founded by a 1935 merger of Communist and Socialist student organizations, the ASU was affiliated with the American Youth Congress. The group was investigated by the Dies Committee of the United States House of Representatives in 1939 over its connections to the Communist Party USA. With the group's Communist-dominated leadership consistently supportive of the twists and turns of Soviet foreign policy, the Socialist minority split from the group in 1939. The organization was terminated in 1941. Organizational history Establishment Following the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, the party line of the world communist movement was changed from the ultra-radicalism of the so-called \\"Third Period\\", which shrilly condemned Social Democrats as \\"Social Fascists\\", to a new phase of broad left wing cooperation known as the Popular Front.Harold Lewack Students in Revolt: The Story of the Intercollegiate League for Industrial Democracy. New York: Student League for Industrial Democracy, n.d. [1953], pg. 15. Efforts immediately followed on the part of the Communist Party-sponsored National Student League (NSL) to unite with its Socialist Party counterpart, which in the middle 1930s was effectively the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID). Initial peace feelers extended by the Communists to the Socialists were rejected in December 1932, but with the European situation worsening two joint conferences of the rival left wing groups were held in 1933 ‚Äî one in Chicago under Communist auspices and another in New York City headed by the League for Industrial Democracy. The two groups decided to retain their separate existence but to work together on matters of common concern, which paved the way for several joint activities which took place in 1934 and the first half of 1935. In June 1935 Joseph P. Lash of the SLID proposed at a meeting of the organization's governing National Executive Committee that the organization should appoint a committee to negotiate a formal merger with the NSL. The NEC of SLID was divided on the matter, but after extensive debate ultimately resolved to appoint a six-member negotiating committee.Lewack, Campus Rebels, pg. 16. Following negotiations between the two participating groups, a Unity Convention of the NSL and SLID was held over the Christmas holidays at the YMCA building in Columbus, Ohio. The American Student Union was thus born. Change of line on pacifism In January 1938 the third annual convention of the ASU, held at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, changed the position of the organization on war.\\"Stalinists in ASU Force Repeal of 'Oxford Pledge.'\\" Workers Age, vol. 7, no. 2 (January 8, 1938), pg. 3. Previously a pacifist organization which endorsed the so-called \\"Oxford Pledge\\" against conscription and militarism, the position of the ASU was brought into line with the foreign policy of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, based upon the notion of collective security. Some opponents of this change were livid and charged that the change was made by bloc voting by members of the Communist Party, as exemplified by the following passage from the press of Jay Lovestone's rival Independent Communist Labor League: > \\"At the outset, it was apparent to all that the Young Communist League > controlled the convention in the form of a well-disciplined group, docile, > responding to the guidance of the Stalinist wire-pullers. Every attempt on > the part of the various advocates of the Oxford Pledge to introduce > substitute motions or amendments, as is done in all parliamentary procedure, > was efficiently squelched by the Stalinist chairman, with the help of his > gloating compatriots on the floor.\\" The vote in favor of changing the political line of the organization on the war question was passed by a vote of 382 to 108. Atrophy and dissolution There was discord in the ASU over the organization's changing position to European armament after 1938, with the Socialist-oriented members generally favoring continuation of the organization's historic opposition to militarism and Communist-oriented members arguing in favor of rearmament and collective security in Europe. The break came the following year, however, with the November 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland. The ASU leadership, consisting by that time of a Communist majority, dutifully supported the military action of the Soviet Union, prompting the Socialist minority to split the organization. The ASU continued forward as a more clearly defined Communist youth organization from that date and entered a period of organizational decline. The group held its final convention in 1941.

Penlee House is currently operated by Penzance Town Council in association with Cornwall Council. Its most well- known painting is The Rain it Raineth Every Day by Norman Garstin who lived for many years in Wellington Terrace, on the edge of the park. History Penlee House was originally built in 1865 as the home of the wealthy Branwell family under the directions of John Richards Branwell. The house and gardens were described in The Cornishman newspaper as ‚Ä≥delightful‚Ä≥ and a ‚Ä≥perfect picture‚Ä≥. (Mr Branwell owned the newspaper!) On his death in 1902, one of his daughter's, Edith looked after the estate and house, and on her death in 1918 it passed to her elder brother, Alfred. Following Alfred's death in 1939, the property passed to his two daughters, Mrs Vera Hancock and Mrs Sybil Ferguson who sold the house and estate to Penzance Borough Council in 1946. The council purchased Penlee Park as a memorial to the dead of World War II and Penlee House was formally opened as the Penzance District Museum in 1949. In 1974 the ownership of the museum and park passed to Penwith District Council, and since 1985 Penzance Town Council owns and operates the site. The collections housed within the museum were originally taken from what remained of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society collection (founded in 1839) which was originally housed within the dome of the Market House in Penzance. During the 1990s Penzance Town Council conducted a major refurbishment of the building providing up to date facilities for housing its important and historic art collection. On the first floor, there are rooms dedicated to the archaeology and social history of the Penwith (Land's End) peninsula. Penlee Cross The large granite cross outside the museum dates from the 11th-century and has been moved, on at least three occasions, its original location being the Green Market in Penzance. While this cross was in the Greenmarket it formed the accepted measurement point for the then Borough of Penzance, all settlements within ¬Ω mile of the cross being classified as being within the control of the said Borough and subject to associated local government taxation. It was moved from the Green Market in 1829 a short distance to a house in North Street (Causewayhead) but on the demolition of this house (ca. 1868) the cross was then moved to a position at the western end of the Market House.Thomas, Charles Penzance Market Cross: a Cornish wonder re-wondered; Penzance: Penlee House Gallery & Museum, 1999 Langdon, A.

The first school was founded on 10 October 1919 in Jalan Lim Lean Teng, Penang. All three schools are controlled by the Han Chiang Board of Directors. Han Chiang School is also a Teochew-founded school and the schools are sited together. Name of school The name, Han Chiang, was adopted from a river in Chaozhou, China called the Han River. The river flows from the town of Chaozhou to the South China Sea. History Han Chiang School was first founded as Han Chiang Primary School in 1919 by the Teochew Association of Penang and Lim Lean Teng. Back then, the school was on Chulia Street. World War II caused the school to cease operations for three years. The school building survived the war; the children still had to go to school. In 1946, Lim Lean Teng decided to establish Han Chiang High School. In 1947, he decided to donate a piece of land, measuring to Han Chiang School because the enrolment was rising quickly. In 1950, his dream was realised when Han Chiang High School was founded and construction work was completed. A statue was dedicated in memory of him in front of Han Chiang High School. It was unveiled by the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman and refurbished and repainted on 2008 to give the statue a new look. Jalan Lim Lean Teng was also dedicated to him. By 1959, Han Chiang Primary School was overcrowded. The other part of the land was given to them. In 1961, after receiving a letter from the Ministry of Education, Han Chiang Primary School decided to turn into a national-type school, renaming itself to SJK(C) Han Chiang. In 1962, a new block was completed. All SJK(C) Han Chiang students moved in. In the 1970s, the enrolment of the school reached 1,700. In 1995, another block consisting of three stories was completed. In 1999, the Han Chiang Board of Directors made a big decision to establish the Han Chiang College. In 2000, it was officially recognised as a college. It has scored many firsts, with Han Chiang Board of Directors aiming to convert Han Chiang College into a university-college by 2012. Yearly main events in Han Chiang School includes 15 July, when Han Chiang High School celebrates its anniversary. It is also a day when all Han Chiang schools come together to remember Lim Lean Teng, the founder, who died in 1963. In 2010, the Board of Directors organised a grand celebration for the three Han Chiang schools in conjunction with SJK(C) Han Chiang's 90th anniversary, Han Chiang High School's 60th anniversary and Han Chiang College's 10th anniversary. The celebration lasted from 9‚Äì15 July and the main celebration was held on 15 July, where a large dinner was to be hosted at Han Chiang High School's field. Former students of Han Chiang, numbering about 10,000, attended the dinner and the event was graced by Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng. Firsts Han Chiang School is the first school in Malaysia to provide education from primary to secondary to college. The primary school is government-funded whereas the secondary and college are private institutions, making it the first of a kind in the education history of Malaysia.

P. Putnam's Sons in 1875. Overview and print history The book critiques Charles Darwin four years after he published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871, and Herbert Spencer, whom the author thought were the most influential men of her day. Darwin had written a letter to her in 1869, thanking her for a copy of her book, Studies in General Science. She also answers Dr. E. H. Clarke and his book Sex and Education which she deplored. Blackwell's book was republished by Hyperion Press in 1976, 1985 and 1992. Parts of the book were first published in Woman's Journal and Popular Science Monthly. Blackwell chose to highlight balance and cooperation rather than struggle and savage rivalry. She criticized Darwin for basing his theory of evolution on \\"time-honored assumption that the male is the normal type of his species\\". She wrote that Spencer scientifically subtracts from the female and Darwin as scientifically adds to the male. It was not until one century later that feminists were working from inside the natural sciences, and could address Darwin's androcentricity. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy wrote in her book Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural Selection (quoting from an excerpt of pages 12‚Äì25 in AnthroNotes for educators published by the National Museum of Natural History), > \\"For a handful of nineteenth-century women intellectuals, however, > evolutionary theory was just too important to ignore. Instead of turning > away, they stepped forward to tap Darwin and Spencer on the shoulder to > express their support for this revolutionary view of human nature, and also > to politely remind them that they had left out half the species.\\" Hrdy added, \\"Evolutionary biology did eventually respond to these criticisms, yet in their lifetimes, the effect that these early Darwinian feminists‚ÄîEliot, Blackwell, Royer, and a few others‚Äîhad on mainstream evolutionary theory can be summed up with one phrase: the road not taken.\\" Contemporary reviews Antoinette Blackwell Popular Science said it is a \\"monograph, written to establish, on scientific grounds, the equality of the sexes throughout Nature\\". \\"Mrs. Blackwell seems to us quite oblivious of the difficulties of the task here undertaken\\". And, regarding maternity, \\"Denying, as we do, the equality of the sexes, and holding to the superiority of the female sex, we protest against the degradation of woman implied...\\". Publishers Weekly thought it was an \\"important contribution to the famous 'sex and education' controversy...\\". The Unitarian Review said the \\"modesty of its preface, at the outset, ought to disarm of his prejudices any reader who can see only superficiality and pretense in the efforts of women after the higher sciences\\". The editor Percy M. Wallace made fun of the book in the notes of the 1897 edition of Tennyson's The Princess: \\"When the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,/And topples down the scales\\". Explained in a note by \\"when the man neglects the proper functions of his supremacy, the woman assumes them, and the result is a subversion of the order of nature\\" followed by a quote of pages 96 and 97 in which Blackwell notes that whenever brilliant- colored male birds acquire maternal instincts, the females acquire male characteristics.

The feminine form is Appia. The praenomen also gave rise to the patronymic gens Appia.George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897)Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & Mythology Origin and meaning As with many praenomina, there is no satisfactory explanation of the meaning of Appius. The origin of the name has been obscured by the fact that it is chiefly known from its association with gens Claudia, and was borne by no other major figures in Roman history. Titus Livius relates the story of how, in the early days of the Roman Republic, a wealthy Sabine by the name of Attius Clausus emigrated to Rome from the town of Cures, together with his family and retainers, and was admitted to the patriciate. He subsequently Latinized his name, becoming Appius Claudius. The Claudii became one of the greatest of the Roman gentes, supplying numerous magistrates over several centuries.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, books I-V The Claudian gens was also one of the proudest and most conservative families at Rome, nearly always siding with the aristocratic party against the plebs and the more reform- minded amongst the patricians. Many of them were known as much by the praenomen Appius as by the nomen Claudius, and the most famous of Roman roads, the Via Appia, or Appian Way, was named for its builder, Appius Claudius Caecus. For this reason, it is often said that the Claudii, who made constant use of the name Appius, were the only family to use that praenomen, and that it must have been a Latinization of the Oscan praenomen Attius or Attus. However, the name was by no means unique to the Claudian gens. During a political crisis in the middle of the 5th century BC, the Capitol was seized by a force of political refugees and slaves in a brief revolt led by Appius Herdonius. Herdonius was a Sabine, like the ancestors of the Claudii, but his name shows that Appius had an existence independent of that gens. During the later years of the Republic, and continuing into Imperial times, the praenomen Appius was used by several plebeian gentes, including the Annii, Junii, Modii, Popidii, Saufeii, Silvii, and Villii. It must also have been used by the ancestors of gens Appia. Thus, it would be more accurate to say that the Claudii were the only patrician family to make regular use of the name. It may well have been more widespread amongst the plebeians, although most of the names that have come down to us from the period of the early Republic are from the leading patrician houses.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft As for whether Appius was introduced to Latin through contact with the Sabines or other Oscan-speaking peoples, it cannot be determined whether it was originally Oscan, or whether it belongs to the class of praenomina that were common to the Latin, Oscan, and Umbrian languages. It may be that when Attius Clausus adopted a Latin name, he chose a praenomen that was the Latin cognate of his own, or that he chose the Latin praenomen that sounded the closest.

He specializes in bone and mineral metabolism and endocrinology, specifically in hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, and bone histomorphometry.  Early life  Dr. Rao was born in the village of Dhanwada, in the Indian state of Telangana on May 11, 1947. Due to the lack of secondary education centers in Dhanwada, he moved to Mahbubnagar for the remainder of his early education. In the mid-1960s he moved to the capital city of Hyderabad to further his education. Reportedly he chose to go into medicine because a family relative asked him if he was good at math, and he answered no. Dr. Rao went on to graduate from Gandhi Medical College in 1969. After graduation, Dr. Rao went on to work at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad where he first began to realize his interest in research.  Career  In the early 1970s, during a doctor shortage in the United States, Dr. Rao applied for residency and was accepted into a General Surgery internship position at New York Methodist Hospital. Later that year, he realized that his research interests were better suited for internal medicine and transferred to finish his residency at Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing, Queens, New York. In 1974, after finishing his medicine residency in New York, an opportunity arose at Henry Ford Hospital for a two-year clinical fellowship in Endocrinology. It was also understood that he would continue onwards for a research fellowship under the tutelage of A. Michael Parfitt, thus beginning a lifelong mentorship. After completing his clinical and research fellowship, he joined the staff of Henry Ford Hospital in 1977, and remains on staff to this day. He now lives in Oakland Township in the northern suburbs of Detroit.  Recognition  Dr. Rao is the current section head of the Bone & Mineral Division within the division of Endocrinology at Henry Ford Hospital. He also serves as the director of the Bone & Mineral Research Laboratory, a laboratory rich in history.

The sisters adopted the social mission of the Catholic Church and Benedictine spirituality with a special devotion to the Holy Spirit.  Founder  Margit Slachta The institute was founded by Margaret Slachta, a pioneer in social service and a leading Hungarian political figure, who trained other women for political action. In 1920 she became the first woman elected to the Hungarian Parliament, where she actively promoted workers‚Äô rights, stressing the well- being of women, children and families. She was inspired by the social and economic turmoil in Europe following the First World War, when tens of thousands of people were living in wretched conditions across the continent. Hungary had seen its territory reduced by some sixty percent by the Allies and was also suffering from waves of political terror by competing forces, as well as conquest by Romania of much of its eastern regions. Margaret and the other founders of the Sisters of Social Service were strongly influenced by their experiences working in the Social Mission Society which was founded by Edith Farkas in Budapest in 1908. In 1923 Edith implemented a number of changes in the organization including a planned merger with a Jesuit women's society. As a result, Margaret, Sister Frederica Horvath (future founder of the SSS in California), and four other sisters left the society and sought to form a new organization founded on the same principles as the original Social Mission Society of working in the world with the poor, but with a greater emphasis on working in politics.Renfro, Jean Marie. Planted by Running Water: The Story of a Charism. 1985  A new religious institute  A dedicated Catholic, Margaret was led to form a religious institute along with some of her coworkers to carry out their commitment to care for the needy and suffering around them. This congregation was established in 1923 under the name of the Sisters of Social Service. The members made the social mission of the Church the motivating thrust of their lives. They embraced Benedictine spirituality and had a special devotion to the Holy Spirit. The Sisters dedicated themselves to God by vows. Like many earlier religious communities of women which arose in similar social conditions (e.g., the Sisters of the Visitation and the Ursulines) the Sisters saw their commitment as being out on the street, involved in the daily struggles of the poor, and they structured their way of life to serve this ministry. To this end, in place of the traditional religious habit of floor-length robes and veils, they adopted simple gray suits as worn by other women of the day. Their aim was to be involved in the social organizations serving these aims. This was to be lived through a daily routine directed by the Rule of Saint Benedict. Growth As the community grew, foundations were set up in other areas. Augusta Ikrich was already working in Rumania when she and her associates joined the Sisters of Social service in 1923. The Slovak District was established by Sister Anita Kowalcze in 1927 in the city of Kassa. Sister Paula Ronai founded a center in Stockholm. During the 1920s, the Sisters followed the massive emigration of the Hungarian population around the world. Sisters also left Budapest to begin a work with Hungarian immigrants on the plains of Western Canada. In 1926 the California District was started in Los Angeles. From the beginning, the Sisters provided charitable services to the poor. They founded and maintained schools to train social workers, organized and led Christian women's movements, worked on Christian formation, and served on city councils. They were, in effect, the first religious congregation of social workers in the United States.  World War II  Sister Sara Salkahazi, beatified for sheltering Jews during the holocaust. The foundress, Sister Margaret, and the other Sisters faced new challenges with the rise of Nazism and the outbreak of World War II. While continuing their commitment to social justice, they also worked to protect their Jewish neighbors. Many of them were sheltered in the motherhouse and in homes organized and run by members of the congregation. On December 27, 1944, members of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross movement surrounded the hostel Sister S√°ra Salkah√°zi ran and began to arrest the Jewish women being sheltered there, along with a Christian volunteer. Sister Sara arrived during the raid, and identified herself as the director of the house. She was immediately arrested and taken with the other women to the banks of the Danube, where they were all stripped and shot, and their bodies then thrown into the river. Hers was never recovered. On September 17, 2006, with the authorization of Pope Benedict XVI, she was beatified as a martyr in Budapest by the Cardinal Primate of Hungary. She is the first Hungarian who was not a member of the Hungarian royal family to be honored by the Catholic Church in this way. The entire congregation is credited with having saved the lives of about one thousand Jews from the Nazis.  Separation  The outbreak of the war and the subsequent occupation of Hungary by Communist forces had led to a separation of the communities of the Sisters in the United States and Canada from the Motherhouse in Budapest. As a result, they quickly each became independent of Europe. The Sisters in the United States were headquartered in Los Angeles and those in Canada in Toronto. The Sisters in the United States were led by Sister Frederica Horvath who had been one of the founding members of the sisterhood.  Present  The Federation of the Sisters of Social Service embraces three continents and nine countries.The Sisters of Social Service (of Budapest) Today the three separate congregations established from the work of Sister Margaret are formed into a federation to honor their joint commitment to her vision. They serve around the globe, with the European congregation serving in Eastern Europe, as well as in Cuba. The American one also works in Mexico, the Philippines, and Taiwan.

Eyewitnesses reported that massive waves had struck the ferry repeatedly, causing the starboard side of the ship to crack. Subsequently, a considerable amount of water poured into the deck. By 9:55 a.m. the ferry was fully submerged. Search and rescue personnel were deployed to the area. More than 250 survivors were found. 42 bodies were discovered in the following days and 33 were still missing. Those who are listed as missing are presumed to have died in the accident. The accident is the second major ferry disaster in Indonesia in 2009. Earlier in the year, a ferry carrying more than 300 people capsized during bad weather in Majene, West Sulawesi, and more than 300 were killed in the disaster. The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Committee. The investigation revealed that the superstructure's front wall of the ferry wasn't strong enough to counter-act the force of the wave. The wave struck the ferry repeatedly and subsequently damaged the front wall. As it was cracked by the wave, water managed to enter the main deck. The wave struck the ferry repeatedly, which ultimately caused the subsequent flooding of the deck. As the deck was flooded with water, the ferry lost its ability to float. Sinking MV. Dumai Express 10 regularly operates ferry service from the city of Batam, Riau Islands to Dumai, Riau with a stopover in Karimun Regency. It is a daily service and the trip usually takes about 7 ‚Äì 8 hours. The ferry has 3 decks and a capacity of at least 250 passengers and crews. On 22 November 2009, at 08:05 local time (UTC+7), the ferry departed Sekupang Ferry Terminal with 329 passengers and crews. The weather at the time was still in good condition. The ferry was cruising at a speed of 26 knots. The ferry then arrived at an area called as Karang Banteng at 08:23 local time and the Captain then changed the heading of the ferry. At 08:44, the ferry reached Nipah Island. Several minutes later, after it had passed Nipah Island, the weather deteriorated and the waves became higher, with an estimated height of 2.5 ‚Äì 4 meters. Windspeed reached 22 knots. The owner of the ferry told the captain to continue to Dumai. At 09:28 local time, as huge waves slammed the ferry repeatedly, the crew heard the sound of a crack near the bridge. A crew was ordered by the captain to check the origin of the sound. The crew spotted that a crack had formed on the front wall and water had rushed into the passenger area. Passengers who noticed this started to panic. The crew raised his observation to the Captain. The Captain then changed the heading of the ferry and turned the ferry to the island of Iyu Kecil. Huge waves struck the ferry repeatedly from the front, causing large quantity of water to enter the passenger area. The water entered the deck from the air conditioning shaft. Due to the large amount of water, the ferry started to tilt to its portside and its bow started to sink. The stern started to rise. The captain decided to stop the ferry and began to evacuate the passengers. As the ferry sank further, eyewitness stated that the crack on the wall burst and large amount of water immediately rushed to the passenger area. The ferry has three decks, mainly the main deck (main passenger area), the lower deck, and the upper deck (VIP area). The water initially flooded the main deck, however it later managed to flood the lower deck as well. Panicking passengers rushed to the door, causing a massive build-up. This build-up worsened the listing of the ferry. Most people rushed to the ferry's stern (the back), which was raised due to the sinking of the bow. Many people had to crawl and hold onto the seats as the ferry listed severely. According to survivors, several people on the front part of the lower deck were unable to escape due to the angle of the list and the large amount of water. Several children had lost their grips from their parents due to the panic. Several passengers smashed the side windows to escape while others immediately jumped into the water even though the crew had not finished inflating the lifeboats. The bad weather condition severely hampered the evacuation process. At 09:55, MV. Dumai Express 10 was fully submerged and sank. Search and rescue First report was received by officials at around 10:30 local time. Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency immediately deployed 5 patrol ships to the area. Ferries and other fishing boats joined the rescue effort. 180 survivors were rescued while 1 body was recovered by rescue team. At the time, 59 people were still listed as missing. The evacuation was slow due to bad weather in the area. Crisis centre was set up in Dumai. On the evening of 22 November, 18 bodies were recovered from the sea. Among the dead bodies were two infants. 261 were able to be rescued from the sea. As of 22 November, the death toll was at 22. On 23 November, Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency reported that 30 people were killed and dozens were listed as missing. Among the dead was the owner of the ferry, Boheng, who was also the head of PT. Lestari Indomas Bahari, the company that operated the ferry. Passengers recalled that the last time they saw him he was giving his lifejacket to a passenger who was pleading for help. The Central Crisis Centre in Karimun had prepared hundreds of body bags. The house of the regent of Karimun Regency Nurdin Basirun was used as a temporary shelter for the survivors and as a crisis centre. 14 ships, including 3 military ships, and helicopter were dispatched to the area. However, the weather in the area was still in adverse condition. Huge waves hampered the search and rescue effort. The propeller of a Search and Rescue ship got damaged after being struck by high waves in the area. Officials stated that several additional body bags were retrieved from Karimun Regional Hospital and Karimun Harbour. The number of survivors were revised to 255. One body was repatriated to Riau. On 25 November, officials deployed 21 units of ship, including 4 military ships, to the area. The Indonesian Navy and Indonesian Customs joined the search and rescue operation. The search and rescue effort was still hampered by rough waves. 14 bodies were repatriated to Dumai and 105 survivors were returned to Batam. Officials stated that 5 bodies had been recovered from the sea. On 28 November, the search and rescue operation was stopped by the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency. Officials stated that 40 bodies were found during the operation, while 35 people were still missing. Salvage After the discontinuation of the search and rescue operation, relatives of the missing pleaded to officials to resume rescue effort. They asked rescuers to find the wreckage of the sunken ferry and search for more bodies, as they believed that most of the missing were trapped inside. Members of the rescue team then started an operation to locate the wreckage. Planes and ships equipped with sonar were deployed to the area. On 2 December, at 16:00 local time, the wreckage of the ferry was located by KRI Pulau Romang, an Indonesian military ship. The wreckage was at a depth of 40 meters and was about 2 kilometers from the location of the sinking. Divers were sent to the area. They managed to retrieve two more bodies from the wreckage, bringing the death toll to 42. However, 33 people were still missing. Several relatives of the victims asked authorities to recover the sunken ferry. Passengers and crews There were confusion on the number of the passengers and crews aboard the ferry. An Indonesian health official indicated that the ship was carrying 291 people; although the ferry had a capacity of 273, overloading is common. Captain Johan Napitupulu denied that the ferry was overcrowded and indicated that they had no warning of a storm at the time of departure. The passenger manifest indicated that 228 passengers were aboard the ferry. Subsequent investigation revealed that the ferry was also carrying passengers with no tickets. 20 infants and 7 children were confirmed to be aboard. Officials stated that 13 crews were aboard, later finalized the number of the total passengers and crews aboard to 329. A criminal investigation was launched by the police. On 24 November, a press conference was held by the Ministry of Transportation. They mentioned about the overloading issue and warned officials who were responsible for it would be fired or disciplined. There were reports that officials from the harbour accepted money from passengers so the passengers could board the ferry that had been loaded nearly its maximum capacity. Members of the NTSC added that the case of the sinking might be handed over to the Indonesian Court of Shipping. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Committee stated that it will investigate on the operation of the ferry, the crew performance and the design and construction of the ferry. Cracks in the superstructure Multiple witnesses stated that water entered the passenger area through cracks that had been formed by the strong rough waves. Investigators stated that cracks were located near the bridge. Divers who checked the wreckage confirmed that cracks had formed on the superstructure's front wall. Since there was no drainage on the bridge area of the main deck, the water flooded the area. The flooding of the main deck caused the ferry to lose its ability to float due to free surface effect. The bow also started to sink and the ferry started to list to its portside. Construction workers stated that the superstructure's front wall of the ferry was using FRP, with a fiber thickness of 8 fiber layers. The wall of the bow was reinforced with some sturdy blocks. Calculation conducted by investigators revealed that the blocks weren't strong enough to hold the structural integrity of the superstructure. Investigators stated that the since the superstructure was built with FRP materials, the superstructure was prone to impact load. Prior to the sinking, the ferry was travelling at a speed of approximately 26 knots. As it was travelling against the waves, the force of the waves was powerful enough to tore the superstructure. Eyewitness confirmed that the force was so strong that a television, which was placed behind the wall, fell to the floor due to the impact. Investigators stated that typically, a fiber layer was accompanied with resin and catalyst. If the proportion between resin and catalyst was high, then the superstructures would become brittle. Inspection on the wreckage showed that the catalyst on the fiber was higher than the amount of resin, confirming the investigators that the 4 mm thick front wall was easily breakable. Water in the ferry Investigators noted that the forecastle deck of MV Dumai Express 10 was an open deck and was surrounded by bulwark. Due to this, water couldn't immediately leave the deck and subsequently trapped inside the deck. Continuous impact by the waves weaken the wall. The weak structure of the wall caused the forming of hole. The water leaked into the air conditioning shaft, flooding the front portion of the main passenger area and later managed to reach the access port of the cargo compartment, which was located near the shaft. The lid wasn't waterproof, so water immediately leaked into the cargo compartment. Poor crew professionalism Had the Captain of the ferry discontinued the journey to Dumai, the disaster would've been averted. Investigators noted that the Captain was experienced enough to recognize that the weather at the time was not suitable for a ferry to operate. Further investigations revealed that he had not followed the correct procedure for on board emergency. The captain should've sent distress signal to the authorities on the land. Testimonies collected from survivors revealed that there was no coordination from the crew. The crowd control was poor and panic was not contained. There were no instructions from the crew on how to react during an emergency. Due to this, several passengers took their own initiatives. Several of the passengers started to smash the windows while others immediately jumped onto the sea. The crew should've also conducted damage control on the ferry. Survivors stated that the crew never attempted to decrease the volume of water or at least tried to fix the problem. Investigators noted that the crew weren't trained enough to deal with such situation. The crew didn't understand the emergency procedure well enough due to their high roster time. They were also not properly supervised by the company and correct regulation implementation was not effectively done by the company.

Tussar silk (alternatively spelled as tussah, tushar, tassar, tussore, tasar, tussur, tusser and also known as (Sanskrit) kosa silk) is produced from larvae of several species of silkworms belonging to the moth genus Antheraea, including A. assamensis, A. mylitta, A. paphia, A. pernyi, A. roylei and A. yamamai. These silkworms live in the wild forests in trees belonging to Terminalia species and Shorea robusta as well as other food plants like jamun and oak found in South Asia, eating the leaves of the trees they live on. Tussar silk is valued for its rich texture and natural deep gold colour, and varieties are produced in many countries, including China,Su Jing, Lun Luo, Landlord and Labor in Late Imperial China: Case Studies from Shandong, Harvard University Asia Center, 1978 India, Japan, and Sri Lanka.Eliza Thompson, Silk, Read Books, 2010 Process In order to kill the silkworms, the cocoons are dried in the sun. A variation of the process exists in which the silkworms are allowed to leave before the cocoons are soaked in boiling water to soften the silk and then reeled. Single-shelled, oval-shaped cocoons are collected and then boiled to extract the silk yarn. Boiling is a very important part in the manufacturing of silk, as it softens the cocoon and makes the extraction of silk easier. In conventional sericulture, the cocoons are boiled with the larvae still inside; however, if the cocoons are boiled after the larvae have left them, the silk made is then called \\"non-violent silk\\" or \\"Ahimsa silk\\". In China, the silks are given different names when silkworms are reared on different plants, as the diet of the silkworms has an effect on the quality of the silk. For example, silk from larvae on the wild mulberry is called zhe, while those on the oak Quercus dentata produce hu. Tussar silk is considered more textured than cultivated Bombyx or \\"mulberry\\" silk, but it has shorter fibres, which makes it less durable. It has a dull gold sheen. As most of the cocoons are collected from the forest, it is considered by many as a forest product. Production in India Tussar sarees India is the second largest producer of tussar silk and the exclusive producer of Indian tussar (also known as tropical tussar), which is largely tended to by tribals. Much of it is produced in Bhagalpur (where it is called Bhagalpur silk), Bihar and Malda district of West Bengal. Tussar silk is also used for Orissa's pattachitras and West Bengal's kantha stitches. Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh also produce tussar silk. In recent years, the state of Jharkhand has emerged as the biggest producer of tussar silk. Bhagalpur silk The tussar silk weaving industry in Bhagalpur, more than a century old, has about 30,000 handloom weavers working on some 25,000 handlooms. The total value of annual trade is around Rs. 100 crores, about half of which comes from exports. Uses The saree is the most important tussar silk product although it is also used as the base material for handicrafts, furnishing fabrics, and stitched apparel. With the introduction of chemical dyes, the range of available colors has increased significantly. There are fashion designers who use tussar silk in their creations. The precisely finished and designer garments produced from tussar silk are known globally and are exported worldwide. Tussar silk is a popular additive to soap. The short silk fibers are typically dissolved in lye water, which is then added to oils to make soap. Soap made with Tussar silk has a \\"slippery\\" quality and is considered more luxurious-feeling than soap made without. Tussar silk roving can be bought at soapmaking supply stores.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline and comic book series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's survivalist and debuted in 1987. Profile His real name is Stuart R. Selkirk, and his rank is that of sergeant E-5. Outback was born in Big Piney, Wyoming. Outback's primary military specialty is infantry, and his secondary military specialty is survival training instructor. Outback was an instructor at both the Survival School and the Jungle Warfare Training Center. He has had extensive experience in Central America and other undisclosed locations. Outback is not intimidated by wilderness, and believes in being part of his environment rather than its adversary. His reputation in extreme climates and environments earned him a spot on the G.I. Joe Team, and access to the latest gear and military technology, but Outback prefers to prove his ability to do without it. He views the gadgets and gizmos of today's modern world as distractions, which come at the expense of essential skills like finding food, crafting shelter, and navigating the world without the use of GPS. Outback's ability to improvise solutions with the bare minimum of resources, has saved his life and the lives of his teammates time and again. SURVIVAL The word \\"Survival\\" printed on his shirt is an acronym, taken from the U.S. Army Ranger Handbook: * Size up the situation. * Undue haste makes waste. * Remember where you are. * Vanquish fear and panic. * Improve your situation. * Value living. * Act like the natives. * Learn basic skills.

After the war, Daugherty returned to live in Maryland, where he encountered Jim Crow laws that segregated African Americans from whites in many aspects of life. Daugherty became the first African American to serve as a member of the school board of Montgomery County, Maryland. After the war, he was recognized for his bravery during World War II by receiving the Bronze Star Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He wrote a self-published autobiography, The Buffalo Saga: A Story from World War 28 U.S. Army 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalopians. Drafted During World War II, Daugherty had a job working for the U.S. government in Washington, D.C. for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and believed that because of this he would not be drafted into the military. However, in December 1943 he received a draft letter ordering him to report for duty; Daugherty was only 19 years old at the time. He had very mixed feelings about serving in the military, due to the reality of living under Jim Crow laws that deprived him and other African Americans of many of their civil rights and liberties. He felt that it was difficult for him to justify going to another country to fight for someone else's freedom under the flag of a country that denied him his own. Daugherty, recalling his feelings about being drafted as a second-class citizen, describes thinking: \\"How dare they draft me and force me to go into a war when I was living in D.C. and had to go to segregated schools‚Ä¶I was fighting for two evils, the Nazis in Germany and my own country that was doing the same kind of things.\\" Still, he reported for duty, and was assigned to the all- black 92nd Infantry Division, known from its World War I nickname as the Buffalo Soldiers, a term given to African-American troops by Native Americans during the late 19th century. Although the 92nd had significant casualties, Daugherty recounts how the military did not send replacement troops to keep their numbers up. As units within his division were cut down through attrition, they were forced to continue on without reinforcements. Daugherty recalls asking another soldier why the officers couldn‚Äôt just call up replacements, and he replied: \\"Look, bud, they don‚Äôt train colored soldiers to fight‚Ä¶they train them to load ships, and you don‚Äôt expect them to put white boys in a Negro outfit, do you? What do you think this is, a democracy or something?\\" He saw combat action in Italian Campaign during late 1943 and early 1944, including operations in the area between Bologna and Florence. Daugherty expressed the opinion that the 92nd was meant to keep German troops occupied in Italy, preventing them from being deployed to fight against the Soviet Army in eastern Europe, or against the Allied forces moving against the German frontier along the Rhine. This was perceived as a policy of using African-American soldiers in a secondary role, instead of including them in the main thrust in the north. Daugherty narrowly escaped death after surviving a mortar attack. He describes the surprise that other soldiers had at seeing him walking around afterwards with a bright shard of steel shrapnel, which he had received during the barrage, sticking out of his helmet, and which came within 1/4 of an inch (0.6 cm) from penetrating his skull. Back home After the war ended, Daugherty returned to his home in Maryland, and ended up working in the same job at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing that he had held before being drafted. He used money from the G.I. Bill to put himself through college at Howard University, and eventually became the first African American to serve on the local Montgomery County School Board, one of the largest school districts in the U.S. He also had a distinguished career working for the United States Public Health Service in administrative capacities, as well as serving for many years in a governor-appointed position with the Maryland School for the Deaf. Daugherty describes that he received no hero's welcome after coming home from World War II. Instead, he and the other African Americans who had fought in the war came home to face the same situation that they had left, including legally-sanctioned racial discrimination and segregation. The African American soldiers who served in World War II were overlooked when it came time to hand out medals, and it was not until many years later, and after significant changes in American life and law, that medals began to be awarded to some of the members of the 92nd Infantry Division, some of them posthumously. In 1997 two soldiers from the 92nd finally received the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Bill Clinton. Daugherty himself received the Bronze Star Medal for heroic achievement, and a Combat Infantryman Badge for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy. In his book, Daugherty describes how he chose to face the racism in his country after returning home. He writes: \\"We are home now though our flame flickers low. Will you fan it with the winds of freedom, or will you smother it with the sands of humiliation? Will it be that we fought for the lesser of two evils? Or is there this freedom and happiness for all men?\\" Dedicating his life to working in public health to help all people regardless of race or background was how Daugherty chose to respond to this challenge. Writing his memoirs As part of his determination to grapple with the struggle of returning home from the war to a Jim Crow America, Daugherty wrote the original manuscript of his autobiography in 1947, two years after the end of World War II. He wrote it down by hand, and his wife Dorothy then typed out numerous copies. She relates how emotional it was for her to do this: \\"It's like I fought that war, all of the emotions that I experienced‚Äîcrying, laughing‚Äîit was so much a part of me, having done it so many times.\\" Finally, after years of having the manuscript lying sealed away, in 2009 Daugherty published his autobiography through self-publishing service Xlibris promoted it, including being interviewed on the National Public Radio program All Things Considered. Daugherty expressed in this interview that although he is pleased to see the current situation in the U.S. military where African Americans are not segregated, and can aspire to hold even the highest positions of power and influence within the system, that he still is reluctant to endorse using the military to gain civil rights for people. He firmly stated that: \\"War is never the answer.\\" After his book was published, his home town of Silver Spring, Maryland, officially declared July 28 as \\"Buffalo Soldier James Daugherty Day\\".

Reese to form a high school district in Galt, California. The city of Galt had an election to decide whether Galt High should be built. The vote tally was 141 yes and 40 no.http://www.galthistory.org/history/school/highschool/index.htm In 1911 after the opening of the school, there were six teachers, three females and three males. The first subjects taught were English, Latin, Math, composition, and music. The first graduate of Galt High was Katherine Reynolds. The first official high school was built in 1913. The second Galt High School was burned down in 1924. The third Galt High was completed in 1927. This school was built prior to earthquake safety laws and was ordered to be demolished in 1948. The school the students attend now is the fourth Galt High School. In the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, to celebrate Galt High School's 100 years of history, Galt alumni searched for fellow graduates to join the celebration. Galt High School had a week-long celebration which included an alumni football game, rallies, contests for boys and girls, and floats made by current and past high school students.http://www.galtheraldonline.com/articles/2011/09/14/lifestyle/doc4e67f3fdaaffc981563167.txt A giant oak tree that sits in the center of the school was planted September 27th of 1949 in honor of Galt high's very own graduates: Abraham Lincoln, Patrick Star, and Whoretilda Jones. These three former students fought bravely in WWII after being drafted into the military after graduating in 1939 in order to fight on the Pacific Front. The three soldiers never made it back, but will always be memorized through the great oak tree. The class of 2012 changed the name of the Galt High library to V. Nunez-M. Yenokida library. It was named after Vesta Nunez and Michiye Yenokida, who served twelve and twenty-seven years, respectively, as Galt High's librarians.http://galtheraldonline.com/articles/2012/05/09/feature_story/doc4fab08673f8af970042703.txt Their school colors are red and white with black trim, and their school mascot is the Warrior. https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&context;=jaaer by FG Mitchell - 1994 In 1925, Galt High School in California established the first recorded public school flight-training.

Nowadays, the school offers activities such as rallies, spirit weeks, Friday lunch activities. There are frequent fire drills, earthquake drills, and even shooting type scenarios. GHS holds an assembly each year for freshmen to prevent gang associations. In the years leading up to the 2009‚Äì2010 academic years, Galt High School faced problems of overcrowding because it was the only school available in the area. Students from Galt, Herald, Wilton, Acampo, and Thornton all attended Galt High. A second high school, Liberty Ranch High, was built to offset the large number of students from the increasing population of the Central Valley. In February 1997, Galt High's criminal justice class was subjected to a search via drug-sniffing dogs. A student, Chris Salamo, refused the search and was escorted to the principal's office where his personal belongings were searched. The search turned up no evidence of illegal drug paraphernalia. A student's jacket created a false alarm with the dogs, but the student wanted a police officer present before the search continued. Nothing illegal was found on either of the students in the classroom. Due to this random search the ACLU was contacted and a lawsuit was filed, claiming an invasion of privacy, which is unconstitutional. Galt High Board of Trustees agreed to drop the drug-sniffing dog program if the lawsuit was also dropped. Part of the agreement was also to remove the suspension of Salamo.http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970516/A_NEWS/305169996  Athletics  Galt High School has many sports teams.

Ancient tales of this type exist in the East but Western variants are not found before the Middle Ages. It was only in the 18th century that the story about the daydreaming milkmaid began to be attributed to Aesop, although it was included in none of the main collections, and it does not appear in the Perry Index. The stories In the East There is a theme common to the many different stories of this type that involves poor persons daydreaming of future wealth arising from a temporary possession. When they get carried away by their fantasy and start acting it out, they break the container on which their dream is founded and find themselves worse off. One of the earliest is included in the Indian Panchatantra as \\"The brahman who built air-castles\\".Franklin Edgerton, Panchatantra Reconstructed, American Oriental Society 1924, vol.2, book V.1 There a man speculates about the wealth that will flow from selling a pot of grain that he has been given, progressing through a series of sales of animals until he has enough to support a wife and family. The child misbehaves, his wife takes no heed, so he kicks her and in doing so upsets the pot that was to make his fortune. Other variants include Bidpai's \\"The Poorman and the Flask of Oil\\", \\"The Barber's Tale of his Fifth Brother\\" from The 1001 NightsThe Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, translated by Richard Francis Burton, volume I, online version and the Jewish story of \\"The Dervish and the Honey Jar\\". The Western fable From its earliest appearance in the 14th century, the story of the daydreaming milkmaid has been told as a cautionary fable illustrating the lesson that you should 'Confine your thoughts to what is real'. It appears in Dialogue 100 of the Dialogus creaturarum.On the migration of fables; monograph by Max M√ºller, 1881 It also appears under the title \\"Of what happened to a woman called Truhana\\" in Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor (1335), one of the earliest works of prose in Castilian SpanishChapter 28. It is different from the Eastern variants in that it is told of a woman on the way to market who starts to speculate on the consequences of investing the sale of her wares in eggs and breeding chickens from them. In this case it is a jar of honey that she unbalances from her head. When the story reappears in a 16th-century French version, the woman has become a milkmaid and engages in detailed financial calculations of her profits. The story gained lasting popularity after it was included in La Fontaine's Fables (VII.10). The charm of La Fontaine's poetic form apart, however, it differs little from the version recorded in his source, Bonaventure des P√©riers' Nouvelles r√©cr√©ations et joyeux devis (1558). There the fable is made an example of the practice of alchemists, who are like 'a good woman that was carrying a pot of milk to market and reckoning up her account as follows: she would sell it for half a sou and with that would buy a dozen eggs which she would set to hatch and have from them a dozen chicks; when they were grown she would have them castrated and then they would fetch five sous each, so that'd be at least a crown with which she would buy two piglets, a male and a female, and farrow a dozen more from them once they were grown, and they'd sell for twenty sous a piece after raising, making twelve francs with which she'd buy a mare that would have a fine foal. It would be really nice as it grew up, prancing about and neighing. And so happy was the good woman imagining this that she began to frisk in imitation of her foal, and that made the pot fall and all the milk spill. And down tumbled with it her eggs, her chickens, her capons, her mare and foal, the whole lot.'The 12th story This has led to the proverb \\"Don't count your chick(en)s until they hatch. The Merry Milkmaid, after Marcellus Laroon (c.1688) In Britain the earliest appearance of the fable was in Bernard Mandeville's selection of adaptations from La Fontaine, which was published under the title Aesop dress'd (1704).The Augustan Society reprint is available on Gutenberg The false connection with Aesop was continued by the story's reappearance in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1761).Fable XIII, p.80-1 Titled there ‚ÄúThe country maid and her milk pail‚Äù, it is prefaced with the sentiment that 'when men suffer their imagination to amuse them with the prospect of distant and uncertain improvements of their condition, they frequently sustain real losses by their inattention to those affairs in which they are immediately concerned'. The story is briefly told and ends with the pail being dislodged when the girl scornfully tosses her head in rejection of all the young men at the dance she was to attend, wearing a new dress to be bought with the proceeds of her commercial activities. A different version was versified by Jefferys Taylor as \\"The Milkmaid\\" in his Aesop in Rhyme (1820).Pages 55-6 As in Bonaventure des P√©riers' telling, the bulk of the poem is given over to the long reckoning of prices. It ends with the maid toppling her pail by superciliously tossing her head in rejection of her former humble circumstances. The moral on which Taylor ends his poem is 'Reckon not your chickens before they are hatched‚Äô, where a later collection has 'Count not...'Aesop's Fables: A New Revised Version From Original Sources, London 1884, Fable 30, \\"The milkmaid and her pot of milk\\" The proverb fits the story and its lesson so well that one is tempted to speculate that it developed out of some earlier oral version of the fable. But the earliest recorded instance of it in the Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs is in a religious sonnet dating from the 1570s. The idiom used by La Fontaine in the course of his long conclusion is 'to build castles in Spain', of which he gives a few examples that make it clear that the meaning he intends is 'to dream of the impossible'. Avoiding that may well be what Bonaventure des P√©riers intended in telling his story too, but in the English versions the moral to be drawn is that to bring a plan to completion more than dreaming is required. A version of the fable was written by the German poet Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim in the 18th century.Fabel IV.1 \\"Die Milchfrau\\" It differs little from other retellings, apart from its conclusion. The woman confesses what has happened to her husband, who advises her to live in the here and now and be content with what she has rather than ‚Äòbuilding castles in air‚Äô. Here he uses the German equivalent of La Fontaine's idiom. The story has also provided German with another idiomatic phrase, 'milkmaid's reckoning' (Milchm√§dchenrechnung), used of drawing na√Øve and false conclusions. Artistic uses of the fable Illustrations of La Fontaine's fables in books, limited as they are to the dismayed milkmaid looking down at her broken crock, are almost uniformly monotonous. An early exception is Jean-Baptiste Oudry's print in which the girl has fallen on her back (1755), an episode unsanctioned by the text.View online The explanation for the inelegant posture seems to be that the idiom la cruche cas√©e (the broken pitcher) then meant the loss of virginity and so suggests a less innocent explanation of how the milk came to be spilt.See the analysis of Greuze's picture of that title Jean-Honor√© Fragonard also depicts a fall in his picture of the fable (1770),Mus√©e Cognacq-Jay, Paris although in this case the girl has tumbled forward and the smoke of her dreams spills from the pitcher at the same time as the milk. Other paintings that allude to the fable at the time include Jean-Baptiste Huet's \\"The milkmaid\\" (La Laiti√®re, 1769)Mus√©e Cognacq-Jay, Paris and Fran√ßois Boucher's ‚ÄúThe little milkmaid‚Äù (1760).Christies site A Gobelins tapestry based on this was later to be presented to the king.See the sale notes on the Christies site In the 19th century the story was taken up elsewhere. The American Symbolist, Albert Pinkham Ryder, painted his \\"Perrette\\" some time before 1890, taking its title from the name that La Fontaine gave his milkmaid. She walks abstractedly through a visionary landscape with the bucket balanced on her head.The Smith College Museum of Art catalogue, New York 2000, pp.214-5 The Spanish Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida painted his \\"The Milkmaid\\" in 1890 and portrays a pensive girl seated on a flowering bank with her bucket overturned beside her.World Classic Gallery In Kate Greenaway's painting of 1893 she is seated instead on the steps of a cottage with the pail on the groundBritish Paintings in a treatment that has been described as Pre-Raphaelite.Kristina Huneault‚Äôs article in Dictionary of Women Artists, Chicago 1997,p.611 In the following century, the fable is featured on one of Jean Vernon's (1897-1975) medals from the 1930s, where Perrette stands with a frieze of her lost beasts behind her.Illustrated online at Creighton University The most celebrated statue of this subject is the bronze figure that the Russian artist Pavel Sokolov (1765‚Äì1831) made for the pleasure grounds planned by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia at his palace of Tsarskoye Selo.A website is devoted to it It shows the seated milkmaid weeping over her broken pot, which has been converted into a water feature by a channeled feed from a nearby spring. Originally it was called \\"Girl with a pitcher\\", but it became so celebrated that it is now better known as \\"The Milkmaid of Tsarskoye Selo\\". There is only a copy there today in what has become a public park, while the original is preserved in a St Petersburg museum. In fact several other copies have been made over the years. One was given by the wife of Nicholas I, the princess Charlotte of Prussia, as a birthday gift to her brother Karl in 1827. This was placed in the grounds of his Glienicke Palace near Berlin but was eventually destroyed during World War II; it is now replaced by a modern copy and is known as Die Milchfrau.Details in German Yet another was erected in the public park of Schloss Britz in 1998, and still another at Soukhanovo, near Moscow. A copy of Pavel Sokolov's statue of The girl with the pitcher in the park of Britz Castle One of the reasons for the original statue's celebrity as 'the muse of Tsarskoye Selo' was its connection with the writer Alexander Pushkin, who stayed there in 1831 and had been inspired to write the poem \\"The statue at Tsarskoye Selo\\". :::::One day a girl with an urn :::::Let it drop on the boulder beneath her. :::::Sadly she sits and alone, :::::Uselessly holding the pieces. :::::But see! What marvel is this? :::::For the water pours yet from her vessel. :::::There she continues today, :::::Her gaze on this endless spring.

O.L., The Dynastic History of the Hellenistic Monarchies of Asia Minor. p. 48 His paternal grandparents were Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus and his first wife, his sister Laodice. Hardly anything is known about Darius. We only have a mention by Appian that he was appointed king of Pontus by Mark Antony. According to Appian, Mark Antony established client kings in the eastern areas of the Roman empire which were under his control on condition that they paid a tribute. In Anatolia, Darius, the son of Pharnaces II and grandson of Mithridates VI, was appointed in Pontus, Polemon in a part of Cilicia and Amyntas in Pisidia. This was in 37 BC, before Antony's war with Parthia, when he was making preparations for it and before he wintered in Athens in the winter of 37/36 BC. The reign of Darius was short-lived. Strabo wrote that Polemon and Lycomedes of Comana attacked Arsaces, one the sons of Pharnaces II, in Sagylium because he ‚Äúwas playing the dynast and attempting a revolution without permission from any of the [Roman] prefects ‚Ä¶‚Äù This stronghold was seized, but Arsaces fled to the mountains where he starved because he was without provisions and without water. Three decades earlier Pompey had ordered the wells to be obstructed by rocks to prevent robbers from hiding on the mountains. Arsaces was captured and killed. Cassius Dio described Polemon as \\"the king of that part of Pontus bordering on Cappadocia‚ÄùCassius Dio, Roman History, 54.24.4-8 Presumably, Polemon was appointed as a king of Pontus as a reward for suppressing Arsaces' attempt to assume the throne of Pontus. Pontus, which had become a Roman province, must have been assigned to several client kings who administered its various regions. We do not know whether Darius died and Arsaces was trying to succeed him or whether Arsaces was a usurper. Darius' reign must have lasted less that a year because Cassius Dio referred to Polemon as a king of Pontus when he was involved in Mark Antony's war against the Parthians in 36 BC.Cassius Dio, Rooma History, 49.25.3  Notes References ;Primary sources *Appian, The Civil Wars, Penguin Classics, 1996; *Cassius Dio, Roman History, vol. 5, Books 46-50 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; *Cassius Dio, Roman History, vol. 6, Books 51-55 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; *Strabo, Geography, vol. 5, Books 10-12 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; ;Secondary sources * Gabelko.

Its usage has such a potent history within the African community that Chris Rock created a documentary entitled Good Hair, which made a wider audience aware of the importance of the term within the black community. Its circulation within the black community in North America has an uncertain origin, predating Rock's documentary. Depending on the context, discussion of \\"good hair\\" can be amusing or painful.  Usage and scholarship  Although many hair stylists or beauticians would define \\"good hair\\" to mean \\"healthy hair\\", the phrase is rarely used in this manner in informal African-American circles. Instead it is used metaphorically to characterize beauty and acceptance. These standards vary for African-American men and women. Historical view of \\"natural hair\\" a Person from Papau new Guinea with afro-textured hair. In her 2009 article, \\"Hairitage: Women Writing Race in Children's Literature\\", the literary critic Dianne Johnson notes an early 1900s advertisement: Johnson notes that the characteristic coarse hair of many ethnic Africans had historically been referred to in the United States during historic times as \\"nappy\\". As the term originated during the years when African-Americans were held as slaves, especially in the South, it retains a negative connotation. Whites associated the natural, coarse hair of Africans with their second-class status as slaves and non-citizens. Johnson explores whether white people understand the concept of \\"good hair\\" and its layers of meaning. She notes a controversy that arose in 1998 Brooklyn, New York when a young white schoolteacher, Ruth Sherman, shared the recently published children's book, Nappy Hair, with her predominately black elementary school students. (The book had received excellent reviews and won three awards, from Parenting Magazine, the Marion Vannett Ridgway 1998 Honor Book Award, and the Paterson Prize 1998 Books for Young People from the Poetry Center.) Although the book was written by Carolivia Herron, an African-American woman, and based on black traditions, some members of the black community objected to its use in the school by a white teacher. Some objected to the book's cover, which featured a young black girl with a big Afro. While some residents demanded that Sherman be removed from the school, most parents supported Sherman and her use of the book (Johnson, 343). The Washington Post reported that Herron said black students were her target audience for the children's book: > \\"I wrote it delighting in nappy hair,\\" said Herron, who is black. \\"I love my > own nappy hair and the stories my uncle used to tell me about it. It was a > celebration, and I had no idea it would be political. I am a '60s person and > thought we had already dealt with this problem of being ashamed of our > hair.\\" At her request, due to the uproar and threats, Sherman transferred to a different district. Discrimination related to hairstyles During the first half of the 20th century in the United States, a period with more emphasis on dress codes than that of the 21st century, both white and black women in certain industries or businesses were restricted in their choice of hair styles. As an example of that period, black women working as stewardesses on American Airlines were prohibited from wearing an African-based style of braids. In Rogers v. American Airlines, the court ruled in favor of American Airlines and allowed them to ban braided haircuts on their female employees.Crawford, 10 Since the late 20th century, many restrictions have been loosened and professional African-American women now wear a wider variety of hairstyles.  Other usages  Singer-songwriter and actress Jill Scott in March 2012 Other prominent images There are other images that perpetuate the binary of European hair types as being \\"good\\" and African hair types as being understood as inherently \\"bad\\", nappy, or kinky. In the 19th century, blackface minstrel shows became a popular form of entertainment. During this time, white actors would paint their faces black and lips red, fluff up or spike their hair, and otherwise caricature the appearance of actual African- Americans, then use their altered appearance to make generalizations about African-Americans' perceived behavior, demeanor and intelligence. Usage and resistance in African-American music India.Arie, Jill Scott, Kehinde Spencer, and other artists have resisted adopting many of the images used to represent them.

Nike has strongly denied the claims in the past, suggesting the company has little control over sub-contracted factories. Beginning in 2002, Nike began auditing its factories for occupational health and safety. Allegations Washington, UK in the 1970s or early 1980s Nike has been accused of using sweatshops since the early 1970s, when it produced goods in South Korea, Mainland China, and Taiwan. As these areas' economies developed, workers became more productive, wages rose, and many moved on to higher paying jobs. Throughout the 1990s, Nike was criticised for selling goods produced in sweatshops. They originally denied claims against them. However, in 2001, Nike director Todd McKean stated in an interview that the \\"initial attitude was, 'Hey, we don't own the factories. We don't control what goes on there.' Quite frankly, that was a sort of irresponsible way to approach this. We had people there every day looking at quality. Clearly, we had leverage and responsibility with certain parts of the business, so why not others?\\" In 2005, protesters at over 40 universities demanded that their institutions endorse companies who use \\"sweat-free\\" labor. Many anti-sweatshop groups were student-led, such as the United Students Against Sweatshops. At Brown University, Nike went so far as to pull out from a contract with the women‚Äôs ice hockey team because of efforts by a student activist group that wanted a code of conduct put in place by the company. Team Sweat is one of the largest groups that specifically tracks and protests about Nike. Team Sweat is \\"an international coalition of consumers, investors, and workers committed to ending the injustices in Nike‚Äôs sweatshops around the world\\" founded in 2000 by Jim Keady. While Keady was conducting his research about Nike at St. John‚Äôs University, the school signed a $3.5 million deal with Nike, forcing all athletes and coaches to endorse Nike. Keady publicly refused to support Nike and was forced to resign his position as soccer coach in 1998. Since resigning, Keady has done original research into the conditions in Nike's Sweatshops. He travelled to Indonesia and for a month lived among the Nike factory workers, surviving on $1.25 per day as the workers do. In 2016, the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and Fair Labor Association (FLA) issued reports on working conditions at the Hansae Vietnam factory complex. The reports detailed various violations of labor standards. In response, students at Georgetown University held a sit-in in December to protest their school's contract with Nike. The university allowed the contract to expire. In July 2017, USAS organized a Global Day of Action Against Nike on which protests were held at numerous Nike stores. In August, Nike reached a new agreement with Georgetown University which granted the WRC full access to Nike's factories. In 2020, the Washington Post reported that Nike purchases from a factory that relies on forced labor from Uyghurs. Factory investigations Advocacy groups engaged in looking at the conditions of the factories in which Nike, Inc. products are made as a way to understand the problems more fully. Throughout the 1990s, Nike experienced rapid growth after they moved their primary branches of production overseas. Record breaking profits were reported and the number of factories increased to fulfill the consumers‚Äô demand for Nike products. The employees were commonly the poor inhabitants of the area surrounding the factory looking for any sort of income. The heads of the factories were Nike contractors who often lived in United States or Europe and did not have any sort of relations with their employees. The duty of supervision was given to an upper-level factory worker. The authority of the supervisor included enforcing rules the workers must follow and making sure that they were performing to optimal standards. The findings of factory investigations show that the supervisor often oversteps their duties. The laws protecting the workers are ignored in favor of cutting costs and lowering health standards. This is possibly because political leaders are paid off by factory supervisors in order to limit governmental interference. The leaders relayed messages to military and police units to overlook the conditions in factories so that the illegal environment could remain open and functioning. They also were warned to watch for signs of labor activism near the factories to prevent workers from aligning with one another for better conditions. Women represent a large proportion of factory employees. Approximately 75 to 80% of workers are women and a majority of those are in their teens or early twenties. Factory jobs may require women to work long hours, ranging from nine to thirteen hours per day, six days a week. They are severely limited in the amount of time they can take off and are forced to work overtime on several occasions during the week. Although there are more women employed at the factories, they represent the minority in the higher paid supervisor positions. Advocacy efforts The goals of transnational advocacy groups working on behalf of Nike factory workers are to allow workers to obtain higher wages, improve the working conditions of the factories, enable them to organize, and gain the respect of their employers. Global efforts have increased the information being spread about Nike sweatshop conditions. Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium, where no Nike factories exist, have branches of organizations that work to better factory conditions. In countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico, and Cambodia, where factories are common, non-governmental organizations push anti-Nike efforts by informing the public through the media of the work environment within the plants. Several well-known advocacy groups are the Global Exchange (United States), Christian Aid (United Kingdom), The Ethical Shopper (New Zealand), and the Clean Clothes Campaign (Europe). There are several types of advocacy groups, ranging from human rights organizations, to religious groups, to labor associations. Advocacy groups function through donations, fundraising, and in some cases governmental funding. A majority of them create informational hand- outs that they distribute to citizens through the mail or at events. There has been a rapid increase in the use of the Internet as a means of distributing information between advocacy groups. The spread of news across national boundaries allows the groups to mobilize and unify campaigns. The main focus of political efforts within the countries that house the factories is an increase in the minimum wage for workers. In Indonesia, other legislative efforts included limits on the number of hours a person can work per day, mandated rest periods, minimum age requirements, and a maternity leave for women. Restrictions on labor activism and labor unions limits the amount of unification workers can develop within the factories. When laws in Indonesia were lifted in the late 1980s, factory workers and non-governmental organizations staged many strikes at Nike factories protesting the poor working conditions. The organizations also worked with international allies such as the United States to bring about awareness in foreign, and often wealthier, countries. These allies provided aide for the workers who were not paid while on strike. The non-governmental organizations within the country have less of an impact on their government‚Äôs view of the protest, but the groups outside of the country have a stronger political pull because of their wealth. Counter-criticism William Stepp, of the libertarian Mises Institute, argues that minimum wage is arbitrary and causes unemployment. Stepp claims that the workers were not exploited and clearly received benefits from working at the factories \\"by showing up for work every day, and by accepting a paycheck based on mutually-agreed-upon terms.\\" Other benefits include free annual physicals, uniforms and clothing, a clinic and health service, a canteen stocked with food, recreation and entertainment, and transportation. However, Stepp criticized Nike for its association with the World Bank, which says is the real exploiter of third world countries. A study by the Nike-founded Global Alliance for Workers and Communities found that 70% of Nike factory workers in Thailand rated their supervisors as good and 72% thought their income was fair. In Vietnam, most workers \\"thought the factory was a 'good place to work' and planned to continue at least three years,\\" and 85% of those polled felt safe there. Further, they felt that the factory offered a more stable career and higher income than farmwork. The addition of factories to Asian countries has allowed them to increase their revenue by providing jobs to previously unemployed groups of citizens. People commonly move to areas where they know a factory is going to be built in order to earn even a low income. Migrant workers frequently send their wages back to their families in their home country. These employees are willing to do work that citizens of first world countries are not, especially for low wages. Since most of the economies of the small, poor countries were centred around their market system, the introduction of large factories owned by a wealthy corporation greatly increased their flow of money. Nike response Nike began to monitor working conditions in factories that produce their products. During the 1990s, Nike installed a code of conduct for their factories. This code is called SHAPE: Safety, Health, Attitude, People, and Environment. The company spends around $10 million a year to follow the code, adhering to regulations for fire safety, air quality, minimum wage, and overtime limits. In 1998, Nike introduced a program to replace its petroleum-based solvents with less dangerous water-based solvents. A year later, an independent expert stated that Nike had, \\"substituted less harmful chemicals in its production, installed local exhaust ventilation systems, and trained key personnel on occupational health and safety issues.\\" The study was conducted in a factory in Vietnam. Nike created a non-governmental organization called the Global Alliance for Workers and Communities that became aligned with several other groups including the International Youth Foundation. The organization releases reports about the corporation and its plans to improve current conditions. The Global Alliance received backlash in 2001 when a report about the Nike Inc. did not include recent events such as strikes, worker terminations, and the lack of collective bargaining in their Indonesian factories. Between 2002 and 2004, Nike audited its factories approximately 600 times, giving each factory a score on a scale of 1 to 100, which is then associated with a letter grade. Most factories received a B, indicating some problems, or C, indicating serious issues aren't being corrected fast enough. When a factory receives a grade of D, Nike threatens to stop producing in that factory unless the conditions are rapidly improved. Nike had plans to expand their monitoring process to include environmental and health issues beginning in 2004. Consumer reaction Several universities, unified by the Worker Rights Consortium, organized a national hunger strike in protest of their school using Nike products for athletics. Feminist groups mobilized boycotts of Nike products after learning of the unfair conditions for the primarily female workers. In the early 1990s, when Nike began a push to increase advertising for female athletic gear, these groups created a campaign called \\"Just Don‚Äôt Do It\\" to bring attention to the poor factory conditions where women create Nike products. Social media platforms have allowed for the rapid spread of information about factory conditions. Websites such as Facebook and Twitter have allowed people from distant countries to share their ideas and collaborate with each other. Advocacy groups commonly use social media sites to post about upcoming events and to keep members informed about the activities of the group. In a Vietnamese Nike factory, a worker accused his employer of striking him. After contacting a factory advocate, the worker was interviewed by a news station. The video eventually reached an ESPN affiliate in Vietnam, where it was viewed by millions of people before officials in the United States had formally heard of the incident. Other controversies In 2000, Nike chairman Phil Knight planned to donate $30 million to his alma mater, the University of Oregon. When the University of Oregon joined the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), Knight revoked his donation because the WRC has been blocked by Nike from inspecting its factories. The Fair Labor Association (which was co-founded by Nike in 1980s) is supported by Nike and the United States government, while the Workers Rights Consortium is not. There has been debate between the university and Knight about the legitimacy of the FLA and which labor monitoring organization is more effective. Another dispute arose from Nike‚Äôs personalization system, NIKEiD. MIT graduate Jonah Peretti attempted to order a pair of shoes from Nike. He chose to have the word ‚Äúsweatshop‚Äù embroidered on them. Nike sent Peretti an email explaining that his personalization request could not be granted for one of four things: it contained another party's trademark or other intellectual property, the name of an athlete or team Nike does not have legal right to use, profanity or inappropriate slang, or was left blank. Peretti replied, expressing to Nike that his personalization did not contain content violating the aforementioned criteria. Nike responded by allowing Peretti to alter his personalization and Peretti chose not to change it and cancelled the order. According to the Mises Institute, the publicity led to Nike selling more of the personalized shoes. See also * Child labor  References  External links * United Students Against Sweatshops Nike, Inc.

Elizabeth's paternal grandmother was Elizabeth Woodville, Queen consort of King Edward IV of England. Elizabeth had 13 siblings, including her eldest brother Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, who succeeded their father when he died in September 1501, when she was about four years old. Two years later, their mother, Cecily married Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, which caused many quarrels over their inheritance. On one occasion, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was forced to intervene on behalf of King Henry VIII of England, and he ordered both Cecily and Thomas to contribute to the dowries of Elizabeth and her three surviving sisters.Harris, Barbara Jean.

The girl, aged six, became a companion to the infant Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII, and Elizabeth Grey's erstwhile companion at the French court, Anne Boleyn, whom the King had married in January of that year. Later, Elizabeth Grey was allegedly part of the conservative faction at court who plotted against Queen Anne.Earlymodernengland, 20 October 2007, accessed 23-11-09 Elizabeth's husband, the Earl of Kildare, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of corruption and plotting rebellion in Ireland, died in 1534. Elizabeth had remained with him, nursing him throughout his imprisonment from July 1534 until his death on 12 December. The Earl had received a gunshot wound at the end of 1532 in an attack he had led against the O'Carroll clan at Birr. Elizabeth retired to her brother Leonard's manor of Beaumanoir, in Leicestershire, while her younger sons were raised at court alongside Prince Edward. Later her son, Edward joined her. Rebellion in Ireland Elizabeth's stepson, \\"Silken Thomas\\" and her five brothers-in-law were executed for rebellion at Tyburn in 1537. Her own brother Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane, the incumbent Lord Deputy of Ireland had put down the rebellion. Her eldest daughter, Elizabeth was sent to the household of Princess Mary at Hunsdon, and it was during that time that the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey would immortalise the ten-year-old girl as \\"The Fair Geraldine\\" in his sonnet, The Geraldine which he wrote while he was briefly imprisoned for striking a courtier. Her eldest son, Gerald, who could not succeed to the earldom of Kildare as a result of its having been forfeited to the Crown, immediately went on the run in Ireland, where in County Tyrconnell, along with other disgruntled clans, formed the Geraldine League. When the federation was defeated in Monaghan in 1539, he fled to the Continent. As a result of Gerald's successful escape, Leonard Grey was attainted and executed for High Treason in July 1541 at the Tower of London by the orders of Henry VIII. Gerald first went to France, and then Italy, where he would remain until his return to England in 1548, in the company of Elizabeth's chaplain. He was received at court by the new King, Edward VI, who returned his confiscated lands. He succeeded to the title of 11th Earl of Kildare in 1554 in the reign of Queen Mary. After a career of fluctuating fortunes, he died in London in 1585, technically a free man but forbidden to return home to Ireland. Elizabeth Grey died on an unknown date sometime after 1548.

History The Blue Ridge Quartet was organized by Frank Stamps's Stamps Quartet Music Company of Texas. They started in Raleigh, North Carolina, but ultimately settled in Spartanburg, South Carolina. When they began in Raleigh at the beginning of 1946 they operated out of radio station WRAL. Among the original members of the group in 1946 were Leonard \\"Red\\" Mathis, tenor; James Smith, lead; Wayne Roseberry, baritone; Shaw Eiland, bass; and William Cunningham, pianist. Eiland and Roseberry were former members of the Stamps-Baxter Lone Star Quartet, also headquartered in Raleigh. After a short time Elmo Fagg and Jack Taylor, both from the Lone Star Quartet, joined them. It wasn't long before Wayne Roseberry left and Everett Payne became the baritone singer. Burl Strevel joined the quartet in 1947 to sing bass, and they moved over to WDBB radio in Burlington, NC. In 1948 they moved to WSPA radio Spartanburg, SC and dropped the \\"Stamps\\" name. Former Lone Star Quartet lead and baritone Clarence Turbyfill joined to sing tenor. In 1949, Kenny Gates became the Blue Ridge Quartet's pianist. When Turbyfill left in 1950, Ed Sprouse became the group's tenor. When Payne left in 1953, Gates picked up the additional duty of singing the baritone part. This lineup of Sprouse, Fagg, Gates, and Strevel remained together for a number of years. Around 1956, Strevel left to join the Sunshine Boys. After some turnover, the bass slot was filled by George Younce. Jim Hamill was hired for the baritone slot with Gates remaining at piano. After a year or so, Bill Crowe replaced Hamill and began a long tenure with the Blue Ridge Quartet. When George Younce left the group to join the Cathedral Quartet in 1964, Burl Strevel returned to sing bass. Shortly after, former Sunshine Boys member Fred Daniel replaced Ed Sprouse at the tenor position. When Elmo Fagg retired in 1968, he was replaced by Laverne Tripp. Beginning in the 1970s there were several years of unprecedented chart success and group popularity. Don Seabolt replaced Fred Daniel in 1972 and Jim Wood also filled the lead slot later in the decade. The Blue Ridge Quartet shared a number one song on the Singing News chart with the Oak Ridge Boys from February through November 1971. The song was \\"I Know.\\" Other number one songs for the group include ‚ÄúThat Day Is Almost Here‚Äù (December 1971-February 1972) and ‚ÄúAfter Calvary‚Äù (October‚ÄìNovember 1972).

In 1982, he went to repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, becoming close colleagues with Osama bin Laden. He participated in the Battle of Jaji, but claimed that Arab claims of victory disillusioned him, and later returned to the United States. Sabrejet incident When al-Qaeda was moving into the Sudan in 1993, bin Laden asked al-Ridi, then living in Texas, to buy a light aircraft to ferry Stinger missiles and other materiel the group had acquired in Afghanistan. With $250,000, al-Ridi purchased a 1960s Sabre-40 jet from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group in Arizona. Since the plane had a range of only 1,500 miles, al-Ridi was forced to make a seven-leg journey to deliver the plane, flying to Sault Sainte Marie, then to Frobisher Bay where -65 weather cracked a windshield and burst the hydraulics, causing him to lose a week repairing the aircraft. Finally he embarked to Iceland, through Europe and finally arriving in Cairo, before embarking on the final leg of his trip. A year and a half after delivering the plane, al-Ridi was called back to Khartoum, where he met with Ihab Ali Nawawi, and was informed that improper maintenance made the plane inoperable. Wadi el-Hage requested that the pair fix the aircraft, and then take it back to Cairo to re-sell it. The pair of them tried to repair the plane, its tires had melted to the runway and its engines were filled with sand. The brakes failed after a test flight with both men flying, and the plane crashed into a sand dune. The event attracted public attention, since the plane was unique in being a private aircraft at Khartoum International Airport and known to belong to Osama bin Laden. Worried that the Egyptian Mukhabarat would learn of his whereabouts, al-Ridi fled the Sudan.United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, January 14, 2001 Later life In 1998, he was called to testify against Wadi el-Hage.

Chronology Planning the raid Modern Inglewood within Los Angeles County Thomas Lee Woolwine, lawyer and politician, alt= Police officer Shambeau told a coroner's jury that he had talked with some of Inglewood's leading citizens about the prospective raid several days before the event. Ku Klux Klan official N.A. Baker was in charge of a planning meeting held in the Beaver funeral home on Friday, April 21, 1922, where the meeting started with prayer and then several people took an oath of fealty to the Klan, including Shambeau. It was later said that the Elduayen family were bootleggers who had sold liquor causing the death of one man and the blinding of another. A Los Angeles Examiner reporter testified at a coroner's inquest that the assemblage was told that there was to be \\"no tar and feathers,\\" by order of \\"the big boss.\\" Shambeau testified at the trial that the raiders \\"did not have enough robes to go around\\" for the raid on some \\"Mexican's place where rotten booze was made,\\" that Baker ordered white handkerchiefs to be used on automobile radiator caps as identification and that handkerchiefs were also to be used as masks.\\"State Bolsters Case Against 'Night Riders'; Witness Tells of Klan Gathering on Night Preceding Raid to Lay Plans for Attack,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 15, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 5 The raid Blake E. Shambeau Los Angeles Times photo The next evening, Saturday, April 22, 1922, a group of 20 to 25 men from Inglewood, Huntington Park, Los Angeles, Venice, and Redondo Beach assembled at the Titan Garage in Inglewood. They included H.B. Beaver, H.A. Wait, Thomas Jennings and Dr. Ed Campbell, according to Shambeau's testimony. They went to Pine Avenue, where they helped make up a band of 50 to 200 men (the estimates varied), most of them masked, who were gathered near the home of Fidel and Angela Elduayen, their children, Bernarda, 13, and Mary, 15, and Fidel's brother, Mathias. Some entered the house, and others remained in the yard, occupied a barn or guarded the roads. Fidel Elduayen testified to the coroner‚Äôs inquest in Spanish that he and Mathias were seized, bound, and threatened with death. They heard shots fired, then they were driven first to the Inglewood jail and then to one in Redondo Beach, where their captors tried to lodge them but were refused by the officials in charge. In a neighboring house a \\"Japanese\\" man, T. Shitara, telephoned Inglewood officials to report the event. His first call, to the \\"Constable of the town\\", was unsuccessful. Then he called the City Marshal's office, and Frank Woerner responded aboard a motorcycle that was piloted by a civilian, Clyde Vannatta. Shots were exchanged and one of the Klansmen fell mortally wounded. He was M.B. Mosher, the constable who could not be reached when Shitara called earlier.\\"Eyes of Nation Focused on Trial of Klansmen; Supremacy of Duly Constituted Government Held at Stake; Case Begins Tomorrow,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 11\\"One Held in Night Raid,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 24, 1922, section 1, page 1 Woerner had been driven to the Pine Avenue home from the City Hall by motorcyclist Vannatta; they were greeted by armed men, one of whom, M.

The two Elduayen girls told reporters and later testified at trial that they were forced to change from their nightgowns with their bedroom door open as the masked men roamed their home. At the first opportunity, they and their mother fled and hid in the alfalfa fields.\\"Klan Leader Halts Trial; Raid Leader Faints as Girl Relates Story; Defendant Sent to Hospital After Illness; Baker's Collapse May Cause Long Delay Former Kleagle Taken to Hospital,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 11, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 2 Coroner's inquest A coroner's inquest was held on Monday, April 25, in the same room in Beaver's combination furniture store and funeral home, where, according to the testimony of participant Shambeau, the Inglewood police officer, the KKK action had been planned just four days before. Marker over Medford B. Mosher's grave in Inglewood Park Cemetery Included in the testimony was that by Grand Goblin William S. Coburn, who said he knew there were no Klansmen present at the Inglewood raid because he walked through the groups gathered in front of the Elduayen home and gave the \\"Grand Goblin's call\\" and no one answered. Coburn testified that if KKK members or applicants for membership conducted the raid, it was \\"unofficial.\\" Shambeau testified he had attended another meeting the preceding evening at which the raid was planned. In its verdict, the jury found that an \\"illegal masked and armed mob, presumably instigated and directed by members of the K.K.K.,\\" caused Mosher's death; it demanded action to punish perpetrators of the crime.\\"Constable Killed in Ku Klux Raid; California Jury Finds That He Was Member of a Masked Mob; Prosecutions May Follow; Grand Goblin Coburn Says if Klan Made the Raid It Was 'Unofficial,' New York Times, April 26, 1922 Mosher was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery on April 26. Investigation Secretary C.R. Isham of the Los Angeles office of the Ku Klux Klan opens a safe as sheriff's officers and an assistant district attorney stand by. Los Angeles Times photo On the afternoon of Tuesday, April 26, 1922, in the offices of the Ku Klux Klan in the Haas Building at 7th Street and Broadway, Los Angeles, Grand Goblin Coburn refused to hand over to Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz and Detective Walter Hunter the roster of Ku Klux Klan members. The two officers left but returned with a search warrant and a demand to open up the safe. Coburn declined. The officers called a locksmith and were prepared to crack the safe when Coburn changed his mind and ordered it opened. Inside were money receipts and correspondence. Elsewhere in the office searchers seized two embroidered Klan robes and a file of names.A.M. Rochlen, \\"Raid Grand Goblin's Office; Young Mosher Is Arrested; Ku Klux Records Are Seized; May Reveal Secrets,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 27, 1922, section I, pages 1 and 3 Indictment After more than a month of hearing 133 witnesses, an 18-person grand jury on June 7 returned an indictment of two counts of false imprisonment of the Elduayen brothers, two counts of kidnapping the same men, and one count of assault with intent to commit the murder of Frank Woerner against each of the 37 defendants. All of them, except Coburn and Price, admitted taking part in the raid. There were six \\"John Doe\\" indictments returned against men whose identities might become known later. Documents seized in a raid on the offices of former Grand Goblin Coburn were also submitted. A typewriter used in the Los Angeles Klan office was presented. During the hearings, defendant Nathan A. Baker was being held at the County Hospital after his arrest on suspicion of felony when Sheriff Traeger and Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz learned that he planned to escape from California and that he was bordering on a mental and nervous breakdown. Later, on August 15, it was reported that a document had been stolen during the investigative period from the district attorney's office and found its way to the office of Paul Barksdale D'Orr and A.L. Abrahams, attorneys for most of the defendants. District Attorney Woolwine had wanted to use it as the basis for surprise testimony during the trial.\\"Grand jury Inquiry of Klan Evidence Theft; Doran Orders Quiz as Spy System is Suspected After Papers on Raid Are Stolen,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 16, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 5 Los Angeles Examiner connection Donald Parker, photographer for the Los Angeles Examiner, who was present during the raid, told the coroner's jury that he had been a member of the Klan for several months but resigned after April 22. R.B. (or R.D.) Knickerbocker, an Examiner reporter, was also present. Parker said he had been \\"tipped off,\\" possibly by Klan kleagle N.A. Baker, and Knickerbocker said he could not escape from the klansman who was guarding him after he learned of the action that was to take place. Leaders of the proposed raid, Knickerbocker testified at trial, proposed at the Titan Garage to give him a typewritten statement of what had occurred and then, if he and Parker \\"behaved right on the story,\\" they would be offered the opportunity to take part in two more activities planned by the Klan: The first would have been a sortie by Klan members, dressed in their robes, to make an ostentatious, public cash donation to a Culver City church, and the second would have been to witness the tar-and-feathering of a prominent Venice businessman accused of \\"mistreating a girl.\\"\\"Tells Plan for Venice and Culver City Raids; Inglewood Case Witness Declares Klan Was to Tar and Feather Beach City Resident,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 17, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 5 Trial Trial of the 37 defendants began on August 7, 1922, with Judge Houser presiding and eight men and four women in the jury box. On August 10, Nathan A. Baker, the acknowledged leader of the April 22 action, collapsed, \\"crumpled up with a convulsion,\\" during the testimony of 13-year-old Bernarda Elduayen and was taken from the courtroom. His case was later severed from the trial and never continued. The defense referred to the events of April 22 as the \\"Inglewood enterprise\\" and sought to show that officer Frank Woerner shot Mosher without provocation and that the Elduayens were selling liquor; therefore the raid was justified. Defendant Bryson said he had been asked by Kleagle Baker to assist Constable Mosher in the raid and that he, Bryson, deputized some of the men on the way to the Pine Avenue address. He said he had bought whisky, brandy, wine, and gin from the Elduayens before the raid began. The bottles of alcohol were displayed for the jury. Hamilton testified that Charles Casto, one of the defendants, stood guard at the closed bedroom door of the two teenagers, forbidding entry to anyone.\\"Mosher Tells Story of Raid; Son of Slain Constable Put on Witness Stand; Relates How Father Fell in Rain of Bullets; Defense Seeks to Prove Klan Not Responsible,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 23, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 2 In closing arguments, the prosecution stayed mainly with the facts of the case, and the defense used emotional appeals to sway the jury.\\"Lawyers Make Klan Analysis; Day Spent in Summing Up of Testimony; Defendants' Counsel Gives Brilliant Speech; Prosecution Sticks Closely to Facts of Trial,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 25, 1922, section 2, pages 1 and 5 Prosecutor Turney \\"bluntly charged the raiders with being a mob of men who terrorized a mother and two little girls.\\" Defense attorney D'Orr painted a different picture: > Constable Mosher died there defending your children and mine. He died there > upholding the majesty of the law. ... Ladies and gentlemen, any man who > loved his father, whom he believed was in the lawful execution of his duty, > protecting your home and mine against criminality, and who is shot down by a > man who had never been assailed, and sees the fire coming toward him and > does not reply to that fire and seek to stop the assailant, is unworthy of > the name of an American citizen. Verdict After five hours of deliberation ‚Äî a delay caused by the need to fill out a ballot for each charge for each defendant ‚Äî the jury returned with a verdict on August 26 of not guilty on all counts. When Judge Houser adjourned court, the defendants rushed forward to shake the hand of the jurors, some of whom said they considered it a \\"patriotic verdict.\\" Many defendants then entered Houser's chambers and returned with \\"large supplies\\" of the judge's campaign literature and posters. Elduayens' arrest Fidel Elduayen, 41, and Mathias, 31, were arrested on August 26, 1922, by federal agents who charged them with violation of the Volstead Act, which regulated the manufacture and sale of liquor in the United States.\\"Klan Victims Under Arrest; Elduayens Charged With Dry Law Violation; Action Climaxes Acquittal of Night Riders; Brothers Found on Ranch Near Inglewood,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1922, section 4, page 12 The charges were dismissed on February 2, 1924.\\"Inglewood Facing Recall; Klan Element Said to Be After Scalps of Few and Willing to Sacrifice All,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 20, 1925, page A-8 Split in Klan On September 8, 1924, it was reported that more than 25 percent of the Inglewood Klan unit ‚Äî named the Med Mosher Klan No. 1The Los Angeles Times article of September 8, 1924, gave the spelling as \\"Ned.\\" ‚Äî had left the national organization and formed a group called the Reformed Order of Klansmen.

James Background On May 26, 1847, United States Army Major Edmondson, with a company of two hundred infantry and cavalry under Captains Holaway and Robinson, were marching at almost sunset along the Red (Canadian) River. They had just entered Red River Canyon when ambushed by an estimated 500 Mexicans and natives, according to reports given to Colonel Alexander Doniphan, a commander during the New Mexican Campaign. Battle Red River Canyon being very narrow and full of thick, deep mud, Major Edmundson was forced to dismount his cavalry and proceed in the attack on foot with the infantry. Now all on foot, the Americans pushed forward and began to break up the ambush. The Mexicans and natives were repulsed but soon regrouped and assaulted the American position. The Americans slowly made an organized retreat, the withdrawal being covered by a Lieutenant Elliot and his Laclede rangers. At sunrise, the Americans reformed and reentered the canyon, where they discovered that the Mexicans and natives had retreated just before their arrival.

The two cones, with four smaller associated cones, align along a north-northwest line and comprise the Menan Complex. The buttes rise about 800 feet (250 m) above the surrounding Snake River plain and are late Pleistocene in age, dating to approximately 10,000 YBP (Years Before Present). The South Menan Butte is currently in private hands, however North Menan Butte is publicly owned and has been designated as a National Natural Landmark and a Research Natural Area by the United States Congress. The US Bureau of Land Management designated the North Butte as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The volcanoes forming the two major Menan Buttes were created when basaltic magma came into contact with a shallow aquifer or with the precursor of the modern Snake River. Particles of volcanic glass called tachylite were created as the water turned to steam and explosively fragmented the hot magma. The cone shaped deposits are fairly uniform and consist primarily of tuff in lapilli-size particles. Some deposit layers preserve indentations, designated as \\"bomb sags\\", made as larger pyroclastic particles landed on soft layers of tuff. The Menan Buttes stand at an elevation of 5,619 feet (1,713 m.) and are very similar in size and shape. North Menan Butte is slightly larger and elliptical, with axes 3.5 and 2.5 km in length. South Menan Butte measures 3 km x 2 km. The crater of the North Menan Butte is about 3,000 feet (900 m) in diameter and the cone is about 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in diameter. The North Butte's volume is 0.16 cubic miles (0.70 cubic km) and the South Butte measures at 0.07 cubic miles (0.30 cubic km). In comparison, the better known tuff cone Diamond Head on Oahu has a volume of 0.15 cubic miles (0.6 cubic km). The larger buttes in the Menan Complex are asymmetrical. Each has a greater accumulation of material on the northeast, presumably due to strong southwest winds during the initial eruption.Wood, Charles Arthur and J√ºrgen Kienle, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , 978-0-521-43811-7, p. 251 The Menan Buttes are located in Madison County, with lower slopes extending westward into Jefferson County.

It was initiated by American troops against New Mexican insurgents at the presidio town of Las Vegas during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Background During the expedition of American Colonel Alexander Doniphan into New Mexico and Mexico, the American forces were marching north in northern New Mexico at the end of their campaign and months after the Siege of Pueblo de Taos. New Mexican insurgents and their native allies were still in rebellion. On June 26, 1847, the horses belonging to American Captain Horine's company of cavalry were stolen by New Mexicans, who fled into the nearby mountains. Two days later on June 28, a lieutenant named Brown and two privates, with a Mexican guide, were dispatched by a Major Edmondson to pursue the New Mexicans and bring back the horses. After a while and with no return of Lieutenant Brown and his three men, the American force began to suspect that their comrades had been killed. This was confirmed on July 5, when Edmondson received information from a New Mexican woman that three American soldiers had been killed and burnt by the New Mexican militia near Las Vegas. Immediately after receiving the information, Edmondson posted a picket to guard the camp, with orders not to allow anyone to enter without first seeing him. On the same afternoon, Private William Cox, of Captain Hollaway's infantry, was hunting in the mountains when they discovered three suspicious New Mexicans, who were captured and taken back to camp. They were interrogated and one of them reported the deaths of Brown and his men. After hearing this, Edmondson ordered a force of 29 cavalry, 33 infantry, and one 12-pounder mountain howitzer to prepare for a march to Las Vegas. The Americans expected to reach the town before daylight the next morning but arrived later than they expected. Observation of Las Vegas appeared to show it as garrisoned by hundreds of New Mexican militiamen. Battle Edmondson divided his men into two forces, one under the command of Captain Hollaway and the other under Captain Horine. They were now ordered to make a charge simultaneously on the right and left flanks in an effort to gain possession of the presidio. The Americans hastily prepared for a charge and then advanced. The New Mexicans had noticed the approaching United States Army and took up strategic positions along the presidio walls. At first, the Mexicans fired into the charging Americans, who held their fire in order to not slow the charge. Eventually, the Americans closed in on the town and began to swarm the buildings, clearing them out of New Mexicans in a close-quarters action. After only fifteen minutes of fighting, the New Mexicans began a retreat into the surrounding terrain of Las Vegas. The mountain howitzer was apparently never used by American forces. A total of about fifty New Mexicans were captured during the battle. Ten others were killed and according to United States Army reports, others were wounded. No Americans were killed in the battle, although a few had slight wounds. The bodies of the two American privates and their guide were discovered to have been burned as suspected; Lieutenant Brown was left among a pile of rocks unburied. The clothes, swords, muskets, knives and many other trinkets were found to have been dispersed amongst Las Vegas' population. After fighting had ceased and the Americans prepared to take their prisoners back to their camp, they burned some homes and some other buildings, where the fighting had taken place. Sufficient homes and food were left for the remaining civilian population. A nearby home, outside of Las Vegas and belonging to a New Mexican insurgent, was also burned when the Americans left for camp. Aftermath The New Mexican prisoners, by order of Colonel Edward Price, were taken to Santa Fe where they were tried before a court-martial. Ultimately six of the New Mexicans were sentenced to death by hanging. Execution of sentence took place on August 3, 1847. The fate of the other forty or so New Mexican prisoners is not known but it is likely they were released after the end of the war. Three days later, the Battle of Cienega Creek ended the Taos revolt for good. References * Sources: R. E. Twitchell. Old Santa F√© (Santa F√©: R. E. Twitchell, 1925), p. 146 * John T. Hughes.

Mark Nichols (born February 22, 1964) is an American playwright, composer, and lyricist, best known for his musicals Little Boy Goes to Hell (1988), Joe Bean (2003), and How to Survive the Apocalypse (2009). He is also known in the northwestern United States for his work with Fred Jamison (aka Beaverchief of the Lummi) for whom he arranged 20 Northwest Coast Native songs for orchestra, girl choir, and rock band, performed by the Seattle Symphony in 1996. Career Nichols began his writing career as a solo artist on Seattle's PopLlama Records after playing keyboards in bands like The Squirrels and Prudence Dredge. Nichols has composed extensively for Seattle film director, Garrett Bennett, and scored all but one of his films, which include End of the Icon, Farewell to Harry, and A Relative Thing. He has written over twenty published works for theater, particularly rock operas, but also a number of operas for children and underscores for straight plays. He is one of the founders and composers for the Seattle/Mumbai rock band Manooghi Hi. As an orchestrator, he is known for his work on the classic Sub Pop album by Jeremy Enigk Return of the Frog Queen. Mark has produced a number of other seminal northwest albums, particularly Trillian Green's Metamorphosis, \\"Awesome\\"'s CD, Delaware, and Manooghi Hi's debut Hi. In many countries in Europe, his orchestrations for Sub Pop, Glitterhouse Records, folk rock artists The Walkabouts have been widely heard. He received honors for his string arrangements for Norwegian Band Midnight Choir. His score for the Brecht masterpiece Caucasian Chalk Circle has been performed in Cape Town, London, Boise, Chicago, Omaha, Seattle, Helena, Walla Walla, and New York. His surround-sound design for Lauren Weedman's Bust! has been duplicated in many venues around the United States. Little Boy Goes to Hell In 1987 The \\"epic rock fable\\" Little Boy Goes to Hell, was released as a four-record set with book and marked the composer's first attempt at the quirky and ambitiously playful American style of musical theater writing which he says came from \\"his own twisted musical and spiritual life\\". At the time the show was being created he was consistently experiencing temporal lobe epilepsy which he said was symptomatic of what he calls a \\"fear of fear itself\\". The semi-autobiographical sprawling journey story revolves around a man who believes he's the devil. The central conflict concerns his \\"Psychologist's\\" challenge to \\"find a fresh soul\\", one \\"given willingly\\". The bulk of the story follows a young boy's journey home from the hospital as he meets the Jungian clown archetypes along the forest pathway. \\"As a young man I created a storybook hell to calm my realworld fear of hell\\". It apparently worked as the composer's epilepsy subsided a few years after Little Boy was first performed at Seattle's Annex Theater in 1988. Goldmine Magazine said of Little Boy: \\"At last Seattle has a rock musical to do itself proud.\\" The show was also given the award \\"Art Project of the Year,\\" by The Backlash Magazine. Joe Bean The second show to achieve the level of notoriety of Little Boy, Joe Bean, was suggested by his long-time collaborator, Bob McAllister, a Bainbridge Island High School English teacher who had hired Mark to write a spring musical based on the biblical story of Job. Nichols says he did everything possible to make \\"a depressing story\\" as much fun as he could, using a plethora of musical styles from Gilbert and Sullivan-inspired chorus to Grunge-era dirge rock to a sort of primal Dead Can Dance sound. \\"The twist,\\" says Nichols, \\"was that I had no intention of making the characters of God and the Devil simple.\\" What he did was expand them into a set of \\"New Age Gods\\" who torture the wonderfully adaptable Joe Bean in an effort to see how far a \\"polytheistic modern rich hippy\\" can be pushed. In the end Joe has fallen from \\"the luckiest man ever\\" to a homeless waif, yet in his misery is finally able to see clearly the metaphorical and actual difference between character/spirit and play/reality. Nichols has cited one of his biggest theatrical influences as Pirandello's Six Characters In Search of An Author. How to Survive the Apocalypse (aka \\"Burning Opera\\") The most widely popular of the Nichols epic rock operas was created by Erik Davis, Christopher Fuelling, Dana Harrison and Mark Nichols, based on the story of the real-life Burning Man festival, which takes place every year on the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, and its real-life founders. The opera jumps between three time periods in the festival's history: 1986, when \\"the man\\" was first burned on San Francisco's Baker Beach; 1996, when the festival experienced its first real tragedies and deep philosophical clashes; and the present day, as seen through the eyes of three \\"newbies\\" who undergo a series of unnerving trials during their first 24-hours on the desert. The opera had its first production in 2009 at San Francisco's Teatro Zinzanni and played to standing ovations. Publicity for the opera described it as \\"theatrical freak-out that combines rock opera, vaudeville, and a Dionysian revival show that is just as inspired and terrified by current events as you are. Part mutant mystery play, part crash-course in proactive future culture.\\" The concept of epic rock opera seems to have grown in this opera to include an audience-immersive tour of crazy art cars and weirdos and \\"makers\\", which, like Burning Man itself, asks there be \\"no spectators.\\" Theater Works Nichols in 2019 * Little Boy Goes to Hell (1988) * The Potato Boy (1989) * Wonka (Based on the movie) (1990) * The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (1992) * Bessemer's Spectacles (with Glen Berger) (1993) * The Tooth Collector (1994) * Mother Goose (1995) * Searching For Father Christmas (1996) * The Dragon (Eugene Schwartz) (1997) * The Firebugs (1997) * Joe Bean (With Bob McAllister) (2003) * Lie of the Mind (with Sam Shepard and Carla Torgerson) (2004) * Caucasian Chalk Circle (With B.

Biography Ram√≥n de la Sagra was born on 8 April 1798 in A Coru√±a, a province of Spain. His father Lorenzo Mart√≠nez de la Sagra came from a noble merchant family, which became wealthy through trade with the Spanish colonies in America. His mother was Antonia Rodr√≠guez Per√≠s, who met his father in Saint Augustine. His brother migrated to Uruguay to start a business there, when Sagra was three years old. Ram√≥n de la Sagra studied physics for one year in Nautical School of A Coru√±a. Afterwards he attended the military college of Santiago de Compostela until reaching adulthood. Afterwards he joined the local university, where he studied anatomy, medicine, mathematics and pharmaceuticals. There he started spreading liberal ideas. For these actions the Inquisition started threatening him, until he was transferred at the University of Madrid. There he contributed to the liberal newspaper El Conservador, the name being a case of antiphrasis. In 1821 he migrated to Cuba as an assistant of Agust√¨n Rodriguez. One year later he was appointed to the position of Professor of Natural History of Cuba. In 1822 he married Manuela Turnes del R√¨o. For the next ten years he would travel in the Americas, until settling in Paris in 1835. He traveled to the United States from April 20 to September 23 of 1835 and the following year published Five Monthes in the United States of North America in Paris based on his experiences there. He also accumulated several volumes of pamphlets and economic and scientific reports while traveling in the United States. In Paris he became a disciple of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. He returned to Spain in 1837 and was elected a member of the parliament four times (1838, 1840, 1845, 1854) as a representative of the Liberal Party. At the same time he began publishing a thirteen volume history on the political and natural history of Cuba which he would complete in 1857. In 1939 he published Voyage en Hollande et en Belgique sous le rapport de l‚Äôinstruction primaire, des √©tablissements de bien faisance et des prisons, dans les deux pays (published in Paris, 1939 in French and in Spanish in 1844). In 1845 he founded the world's first anarchist journal El Porvenir, which was closed by Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez, Duke of Galicia. After the French Revolution of 1848, he created with Proudhon the Peoples' Bank of France. In Brussels he met Heinrich Ahrens, disciple of Krause, whose doctrines he proclaimed in Spain before Julian Sanz del Rio. He continued to publish economic, geographic, political, social, and prison reform studies. In 1849 he was expelled from France, because he was spreading Socialist ideas. In 1856 he was expelled from Spain to France by Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez, because he was spreading radical ideas. In Paris he met Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. There he worked as the consul of Uruguay. He returned to Cuba between 1859 and 1860 and published numerous studies and essays there. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he went to Switzerland, where he died on 23 May 1871 at the age of seventy-three.

It marked the cinematic debut of the carnatic singer and stage artist K. B. Sundarambal. She was paid a then unprecedented 100,000 (equivalent of 60 million (2013 prices)) as salary for this film. This was also the first film for Ellis R. Dungan. No print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film.  Plot  The story is based on the life of Nandanar (also known as Thirunaalai Povar ‚Äì thee who pilgrims tomorrow) and his becoming of a Naayanar.  Cast  *K. B. Sundarambal as Nandanar *Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer as Vedhiyar  Production  K. B. Sundarambal and Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer in Nandanar K. B. Sundarambal had retired from stage performances in 1932 after the death of her husband S. G. Kittappa. Hassandas, a textile magnate from Madras and a member of Chellaram business family was keen on making a film with Sundarambal in the lead. She was initially reluctant to star in the film and refused even the recommendation of her mentor S. Satyamurti. Hassandas persisted and to discourage him she offered to act in the film if he could pay One lakh Rupees. Hassandas agreed to pay her and the film was made.Blast From the Past ‚Äì Nava Yuvan (1937), The Hindu 6 June 2008 The film was directed by Manik Lal Tandon with Ellis Dungan shooting many scenes in his absence. Sundarambal was cast as a man ‚Äì the untouchable saint Nandanar. The same story had earlier been the subject of a 1932 Tamil film of the same name. Carnatic musician Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer was cast as the landlord Vedhiyar. He was paid 3000 Rs as salary. The script had a scene where Iyer's character would prostrate before Nandanar. Due to the prevailing social norms and her respect for Iyer, Sundarambal refused to do the scene. Director Tandon filmed a compromise by changing the scene such that both prostrated before each other. The completed film cost to make and was 18000 feet long. Tunes of three songs from the 1934 Hindi film Chandidas were reused in this film.  Reception  The film was released in 1935 amid great expectations from the public. It failed at the box office and received mixed reviews from the critics. Kalki Krishnamurthy made fun of it in Ananda Vikatan by claiming buffaloes and palm trees had acted well in the film. He wrote the number one actor in the film was the coconut tree, number two was the buffalo and number three, the kid goat. The Tamil newspaper Dina Mani also gave it an unfavourable review. Writing in the April 1938 issue of the Eelakesari, Pudhumaipithan explained the reasons for its failure: However it received favourable reviews in 15 July 1935 issues of The Hindu, Tamil Nadu, Sudesamithran and Cinema Ulagam. Viswanatha Iyer was criticised by conservative brahimins of his hometown Kumbakonam for acting in the film.

Although believed to be the largest operational mounted cavalry unit remaining in existence, the regiment primarily performs a ceremonial role. History At the time of Indian Independence in 1947, the only mounted cavalry remaining in service were the President's (formerly Viceroy's) Body Guard and several units that had formed part of the Imperial Service State Forces, provided by the Indian Princely States. Upon the integration of the State Forces into the regular Indian Army in 1951, the remaining horsed cavalry units were reorganized and reconstituted into the Gwalior Lancers, the Jodhpur/Kachhawa Horse, the Mysore Lancers, and B Squadron, 2nd Patiala Lancers. In May 1953 it was decided to amalgamate these separate horsed cavalry units into a single regiment. On 1 October 1953 the \\"New Horsed Cavalry Regiment\\" was established at Gwalior, with Lt. Col. Phulel Singh of the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces as its first Commandant. The new regiment was re-designated as the \\"61st Cavalry\\" in January 1954. Modern role Today the 61st Cavalry is one of the limited number of unmechanised mounted cavalry regiments in the world, alongside such units as the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and the 11th Cavalry Regiment of the Moscow Military District.Cossack Cavalry Acting in Russian Films . CNN (transcript), Aired 10 March 2002 - 11:58ET While a number of armies still maintain mounted units these are generally intended for parade and other ceremonial purposes. The Army of the People's Republic of China maintains operational mounted cavalry for frontier duties but these are believed to be of only squadron size.Global Times 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011 While primarily employed on ceremonial occasions, the 61st Cavalry Regiment can be deployed for internal security or police roles if required. The last publicized occasion on which the regiment saw active military service was when it undertook mounted patrol work during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. On Republic Day each year the 61st Cavalry and the President's Body Guard parade in full dress uniform in New Delhi, in what is probably the largest assemblage of traditional cavalry still to be seen in the world. Recruitment The regiment recruits Rajputs, Marathas and Kaimkhanis in equal numbers. This ratio was established on Prime Minister Jawarharalal Nehru's instructions. Sports The regiment has a strong polo playing tradition, producing some of India's best polo players. Members of the regiment have won 11 Arjuna award ‚Äì India's highest award for outstanding sportsmen ‚Äì five times for polo and six times for equestrian events.

Teitel, who had immigrated to Israel in 2000, settling in a West Bank settlement, confessed to planning and committing various acts of terrorism and hate crimes against Palestinians, homosexuals, left-wingers, missionary Christians, and police officers across Israel. Teitel was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is currently serving.  Early life  Yaakov Teitel was born in 1972 in Florida, United States, and moved to Norfolk, Virginia, when he was a teenager. His father, Mark, was a retired dentist who had served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War, and his mother, Dianne, was a medical secretary - both of whom became Haredi Jews later in life. Commonly known as Jack, Teitel attended university and received a bachelor's degree in psychology, and in the mid-1990s, he began making regular visits to Israel. He was arrested in August 1997 on suspicion of murdering a Palestinian shepherd, but was released, and the case was eventually closed due to lack of evidence. Teitel subsequently returned to the United States, where he took a computer course with Microsoft, and began working as a computer technician.  Emigration to Israel  In 1999, Teitel immigrated to Israel and moved to the settlement of Shvut Rachel, becoming an Israeli citizen under the Law of Return in December 2000. The following year, his parents and sister also emigrated to Israel, and settled in Beitar Illit, an Ultra-Orthodox city in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc. In 2002, Teitel met Rivka Pepperman, a British-born dance teacher originally from Broughton Park, Manchester, whose family had moved to Israel in 1981. They married the following year, and had four children. Teitel was summoned by Israel Defense Forces for preliminary checks, but was exempted from conscription due to his advanced age, medical history, and familial state. Teitel was considered an outcast in the settlement due to his limited proficiency in Hebrew and reclusive behavior. He hardly left his home, and did not regularly participate in services at the local synagogue.https://www.haaretz.com/1.5227288http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/the- two-faces-of-accused-terrorist-jack-teitel/  Terrorist acts and arrest  Teitel was arrested in Jerusalem's Har Nof neighborhood on October 7, 2009, while posting flyers praising the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. He attempted to throw away a bag he was carrying, but it was retrieved, and was found to contain two handguns. Teitel was then turned over to Shin Bet for interrogation, while special police units raided his home and the homes of his brother-in-law, parents, and mother-in-law. The search of his property revealed a cache of guns, parts used in explosive devices, pellets used to maximize the impact of explosives, binoculars, and flyers containing anti-gay incitement. The explosives were all detonated safely by the police, and a search of his home two days later found a bomb buried in the backyard. Israeli police revealed that Teitel, acting alone, confessed to a string of terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. Teitel confessed to having carried out a pipe- bomb attack against Ze'ev Sternhell, as well as the murders of a Palestinian taxi driver and a West Bank shepherd in 1997, a 2006 attempted bombing near the settlement of Eli, three bombings against police targets and a Christian monastery in 2007, and sending a booby-trapped package that injured a teenage boy to the home of a Messianic Jewish family in Ariel. In addition to Teitel's confession, his DNA was found to match DNA retrieved from Sternhell's home after the bombing attack. Teitel also confessed that he had planned to fly a remote-controlled toy plane containing explosives into the Tel Aviv gay pride parade, and that he planned a bombing against a Jerusalem gay bar. He also admitted that he planned to fire an improvised mortar against the Al-Aqsa Mosque, but abandoned the plan over fear of injuring Jewish worshippers on the Temple Mount. Teitel was also suspected of murdering two police officers in the Jordan Valley, and confessed to the gay centre shooting in Tel Aviv in 2009, though police stated that they were certain he was not involved in either. Following the discoveries, Teitel was held by Shin Bet in special custody for 48 hours, without being allowed to see an attorney or brought before a judge. The Petah Tikva District Court denied appeals from his attorney to meet with him, and subsequently extended both his remand and the special ordnance banning him from meeting his lawyer. All of Teitel's arraignments were held behind closed doors, and a gag order was imposed on the case. On 10 November 2009, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office declared that Teitel would be charged for the murder of the two Palestinians, incitement to racism, deploying explosive devices, and sabotage. Teitel's legal defense was provided by Honenu, an organization which provides legal defense for Israelis accused of crimes against Arabs or the Israeli security forces. Honenu founder Shmuel Meidad suggested that Teitel may be mentally unstable, stating that, \\"It's my impression that this man is sick, but he's not nearly as sick as the state.\\" On 4 May 2010, Jerusalem's district psychiatrist ruled Teitel unfit to stand trial. The evaluation was criticized by Israeli-Arab Knesset members, with Ahmad Tibi stating, \\"An Arab who shoots a Jew in Israel is a terrorist, but a Jew who shoots Arabs is insane.\\" Following a new psychiatric evaluation, the district court overturned the previous ruling, and declared Teitel fit for trial, on 30 August.  Conviction  In February 2012, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office and Teitel's attorneys agreed to a plea bargain under which he would confess to two counts of murder. Teitel's attorneys confessed on his behalf, as Teitel himself announced that did not recognize the court's jurisdiction. After the indictment, the defense and prosecution would argue over whether Teitel was aware of his actions and is fit for trial, and the court would deliberate over whether Teitel is accountable for his actions. In January 2013, Teitel was convicted on two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder, with the court rejecting the defense's arguments that he was legally insane. In April, he was sentenced to two life sentences and 30 years for the murder of two Palestinians, the attempted murder of two others, and other offenses, and ordered to pay mandatory compensation of NIS 650,000 to the families of the victims.Chaim Levinson, 'Jewish terrorist Jack Tytell gets two life sentences for murder of Palestinians,' at Haaretz, 9 April 2013  References  1972 births Living people American emigrants to Israel American Orthodox Jews Israeli Orthodox Jews Israeli people convicted of murder Jewish religious terrorism People from Norfolk, Virginia Terrorist incidents in Israel in 2008 Violence against LGBT people Bombers (people) ","title":"Yaakov Teitel"},{"id":"25174613","text":"Rakovci () is a settlement in the Slovene Hills () in the Municipality of Sveti Toma≈æ in northeastern Slovenia.

Sunday Sabbatarianism). Prayer and worship Christian prayer in the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox traditions employs bows and prostration. In explicating the origin of the Islamic salat, academics state that it was influenced by the religions prevalent in the Middle East during the time of Muhammad, such as Christianity and Judaism. The five fixed prayer times in Islamic prayer may have their origins in the canonical hours of Christians, especially those used in the 4th century by believers in the Oriental Orthodox Churches (that were widely regarded as Monophysite) who prayed seven times a day, given the extensive contact that Muhammad and his companions had with Syrian Christian monks. Abu Bakr and other early followers of Muhammad were exposed to these fixed times of prayer of the Syrian Christians in Abyssinia and likely relayed their observations to Muhammad, \\"placing the potential for Christian influence directly within the Prophet‚Äôs circle of followers and leaders.\\" Muhammad, who had direct contact with the Christians of NajrƒÅn in Yemen, would have been aware of the Christian practice of facing east while praying, which was ubiquitous in Christendom at the time. The position of prostration used by the Desert Fathers, Coptic Christian monks of Egypt, may have influenced the position of sujjud, marked by the Quranic symbol €©. Ritual washing before performing the Salah was influenced by the Jewish practice of washing one's hands and feet before praying, a practice common among the Jews in Syria, Yathrib and Yemen; the Babylonian Talmud teaches that in the absence of water, earth should be used, a practice adopted in Islam. The Jews face Jerusalem when praying and the Qur'an records that the early Muslims did the same, with the direction of prayer facing Mecca being changed to this later. Justin Paul Heinz regards these as clear examples of syncretism in which Judaism influenced religious practice in Islam.

It was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population were Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khosrau I, refuge was granted to Greek Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa)(also called the Academy of Athens), a Christian theological and medical university.

Daud al-Antaki was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers. Christian merchants and the silk trade The Vank Cathedral. The Armenians moved into the Jolfa district of Isfahan and were free to build their prayer houses, eventually becoming an integral part of the society. The one valuable item, sought for in Europe, which Iran possessed and which could bring in silver in sufficient quantities was silk, which was produced in the northern provinces, along the Caspian coastline. The trade of this product was done by Persians to begin with, but during the 17th century the Christian Armenians became increasingly vital in the trade of this merchandise, as middlemen.Blow; p. 213. Whereas domestic trade was largely in the hands of Persian and Jewish merchants, by the late 17th century, almost all foreign trade was controlled by the Armenians.Savory; p. 195-8 They were even hired by wealthy Persian merchants to travel to Europe when they wanted to create commercial bases there, and the Armenians eventually established themselves in cities like Bursa, Aleppo, Venice, Livorno, Marseilles and Amsterdam. Realizing this, Shah Abbas resettled large numbers of Armenians from the Caucasus to his capital city and provided them with loans. And as the shah realized the importance of doing trade with the Europeans, he assured that the Safavid society was one with religious tolerance. The Christian Armenians thus became a commercial elite in the Safavid society and managed to survive in the tough atmosphere of business being fought over by the British, Dutch, French, Indians and Persians, by always having large capital readily available and by managing to strike harder bargains ensuring cheaper prices than what, for instance, their British rivals ever were able to.Savory; p. 202. Ottoman Empire Immediately after the Conquest of Constantinople, Mehmet II released the his portion of the city's captive Christian population with instructions to start the rebuilding of Constantinople which had been devastated by siege and war.Cigdem Kafescioglu, Constantinopolis/Istanbul: Cultural Encounter, Imperial Vision, and the Construction of the Ottoman Capital (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2009), p.6 Afterwards, he begin to also repopulate the city bringing new inhabitants - both Christian and Muslim - from the whole empire and from the newly conquered territories.Mamboury (1953), p. 98 Phanar was then repopulated with Greeks deported from Mouchlion in the Peloponnese and, after 1461, with citizens of Trebizond.Mamboury (1953), p. 99 The roots of Greek ascendancy can be traced to the need of the Ottomans for skilled and educated negotiators as the power of their empire declined and they were compelled to rely on treaties more than the force of arms. From the 17th century onwards the Ottomans began facing problems in the conduct of their foreign relations, and were having difficulties in dictating terms to their neighbours; the Porte was faced for the first time with the need of participating in diplomatic negotiations. Given the Ottoman tradition of generally ignoring Western European languages and cultures, officials found themselves unable to handle such affairs. The Porte subsequently assigned those tasks to the Greeks who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and could provide the necessary skills. As a result, the so‚àícalled Phanariotes, Greek and Hellenized families mostly native to Constantinople, came to occupy high posts of secretaries and interpreters to Ottoman officials and officers. Some of the most influential Arab nationalists were Arab Christians, like George Habash, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Syrian intellectual Constantin Zureiq. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the Palestinian National Authority since 1992. The suicide bomber Jules Jammal, a Syrian military officer who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian.

Construction Healthcare cubicle curtains are constructed from different woven fabrics stitched together with the top portion of open mesh of the curtain as required by the National Fire Protection Association. The suggested fire prevention and regulatory codes are followed by local, state and Federal fire marshals with Healthcare patient safety in mind. The suggestion for mesh is seventy-percent (70%) open allowing for ceiling sprinkler head water penetration in event of fire. The vertical length requirement for mesh size is determined by the number of horizontal inches of the curtain ceiling track from the sprinkler head. Example: If ceiling track is six (6\\") inches from ceiling sprinkler head, the required vertical length of the mesh is approximately six (6\\") inches. The maximum vertical mesh length required is eighteen inches (18\\") regardless of additional distance from the ceiling sprinkler head. The code for the vertical mesh requirement is found under National Fire Protection Agency code NFPA 13. The lower portion of the cubicle curtain is opaque to ensure patient privacy. Cubicle curtain fabrics with an antimicrobial finish are not required by code but are becoming more common in medical treatment facilities to reduce the spread of germs within a facility.

After finishing high school (\\"Mittlere Reife\\") in 1922 he learned the trade of his father over the next 3 years and in 1925 took an office job in Stuttgart at the \\"Deutsch-Nationalen Handlungsgehilfenverband\\". He entered the Artamanen-Bund, a v√∂lkisch agrarian movement,http://www.auschwitz-prozess-frankfurt.de/index.php?id=104 accessdate Dec 31-2013 and joined the Nazi Party in 1929. He was a member of the general SS beginning in 1930. After losing his job in 1932 he was admitted to the Auxiliary Police at Friedrichshafen and in July 1933 to the political police (\\"Bereitschaftspolizei\\") in Stuttgart. From 1936 to 37 he attended the police training school. He was appointed Police Commissioner (\\"Kriminalsekret√§r\\") after passing the police force examination in 1937, even though he had been taken into custody in 1936 for mistreating a prisoner during an interrogation in 1936. World War II At the beginning of the Second World War he was transferred to the state police lead office at Zichenau. Three weeks later he was placed in charge of setting up and supervising the border police station in Ostro≈Çƒôka. In 1940 he joined the 2nd SS and Police Engineer reserve unit (\\"Polizeipioniersbataillion\\") based in Dresden, from where he was dispatched to the front and subsequently wounded in 1942. Nine months later he was transferred to Auschwitz, first serving as Zugf√ºhrer der 2. Wachkompanie, later as Untersturmf√ºhrer (Second Lieutenant) in the Auschwitz political department. The Political Department was the representative of the RSHA in the camp, and its chief responsibilities were keeping files on individual prisoners, the reception of prisoners, maintaining the security of the camp, combating internal resistance and conducting interrogations. From 23 December 1943 until the evacuation of the camp he was the leader of the section of investigations and interrogations with the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. Auschwitz Wilhelm Boger invented the \\"Boger swing\\", an instrument of torture. Reported after the war by his secretary, Frau Braun: > It was a meter-long iron bar suspended by chains hung from the ceiling ... A > prisoner would be brought in for \\"questioning,\\" stripped naked and bent over > the bar, wrists manacled to ankles. A guard at one side would shove him‚Äîor > her‚Äîoff across the chamber in a long, slow arc, while Boger would ask > \\"questions,\\" at first quietly, then barking them out, and at the last > bellowing. At each return, another guard armed with a crowbar would smash > the victim across the buttocks. As the swinging went on and on, and the > wailing victim fainted, was revived only to faint howling again, the blows > continued‚Äîuntil only a mass of bleeding pulp hung before their eyes. Most > perished from the ordeal--some sooner, some later. In the end a sack bones > and flayed flesh and fat was swept along the shambles of that concrete floor > to be dragged away. Post-war His atrocious crimes in the Political Department continued until the evacuation of Auschwitz in January 1945. Thereafter, on the run for five months until June 1945, he was eventually detained in Ludwigsburg where his parents were living. He should have been extradited to Poland for trial but managed to escape later that same year. From 1948 until mid 1949, he was working as a farm hand in Crailsheim. He then lived with his family under his proper name in Hemmingen near Leonberg. He found a job as supervisor of supplies at the Heinkelwerke, an airplane factory in his birthplace Stuttgart- Zuffenhausen, where he was apprehended in October 1958 at the age of 51. He had heretofore led a withdrawn life; when acquaintances or neighbors asked him about his activities at KZ Auschwitz, he would reply that he had done nothing worthy of regret (er habe sich nichts vorzuwerfen). He passed denazification. The particular organ of justice (\\"Spruchkammer\\") by which he was processed in Stuttgart found \\" ... He does not leave the impression of a raw, brutal man, but more one of a rational, well-schooled police commissioner and civil servant ... \\" and stopped the investigation because of the costs to be borne by the government should the investigation continue.Michael Kienzle and Dirk Mende: Fritz Bauer: \\"Wir k√∂nnen aus der Erde keinen Himmel machen, aber jeder von uns kann etwas tun, dass sie nicht zur H√∂lle wird\\" - Wilhelm Boger: \\"Ich bin der Teufel\\".

On 20 August 1965 he became part of the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials by the Landgericht Frankfurt am Main under Chief Judge Hans Hofmeyer for aiding and abetting the murder of Jews.Hermann Langbein : People in Auschwitz, Ullstein, Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Vienna, 1980. After a series of eyewitness testimonies he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in at least 5 cases, collective murder in at least 109 cases and collective help for collective murder. Death He died at the age of 70 in the prison at Bietigheim-Bissingen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany on 3 April 1977, 19 years after his arrest and trial.

Motivations for using GM insects include biological research purposes and genetic pest management. Genetic pest management capitalizes on recent advances in biotechnology and the growing repertoire of sequenced genomes in order to control pest populations, including insects. Insect genomes can be found in genetic databases such as NCBI, and databases more specific to insects such as FlyBase, VectorBase, and BeetleBase. There is an ongoing initiative started in 2011 to sequence the genomes of 5,000 insects and other arthropods called the i5k. Some Lepidoptera (e.g. monarch butterflies and silkworms) have been genetically modified in nature by the wasp bracovirus.  Types of genetic pest management  The sterile insect technique (SIT) was developed conceptually in the 1930s and 1940s and first used in the environment in the 1950s. SIT is a control strategy where male insects are sterilized, usually by irradiation, then released to mate with wild females. If enough males are released, the females will mate with mostly sterile males and lay non-viable eggs. This causes the population of insects to crash (the abundance of insects is extremely diminished), and in some cases can lead to local eradication. Irradiation is a form of mutagenesis which causes random mutations in DNA. Release of Insects carrying Dominant Lethals (RIDL) is a control strategy using genetically engineered insects that have (carry) a lethal gene in their genome (an organism's DNA). Lethal genes cause death in an organism, and RIDL genes only kill young insects, usually larvae or pupae. Similar to how inheritance of brown eyes is dominant to blue eyes, this lethal gene is dominant so that all offspring of the RIDL insect will also inherit the lethal gene. This lethal gene has a molecular on and off switch, allowing these RIDL insects to be reared. The lethal gene is turned off when the RIDL insects are mass reared in an insectary, and turned on when they are released into the environment. RIDL males and females are released to mate with wild males and their offspring die when they reach the larval or pupal stage because of the lethal gene. This causes the population of insects to crash. This technique is being developed for some insects and for other insects has been tested in the field. It has been used in the Grand Cayman Islands, Panama, and Brazil to control the mosquito vector of dengue, Ae. aegypti. It is being developed for use in diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), medfly and olive fly. Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) ‚Äì Wolbachia Maternal Effect Dominant Embryonic Arrest (Medea) X-Shredder Concerns There are concerns about using tetracycline on a routine basis for controlling the expression of lethal genes. There are plausible routes for resistance genes to develop in the bacteria within the guts of GM-insects fed on tetracycline and from there, to circulate widely in the environment. For example, antibiotic resistant genes could be spread to E.coli bacteria and into fruit by GM-Mediterranean fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata). Releases In January 2016 it was announced that in response to the Zika virus outbreak, Brazil's National Biosafety Committee approved the releases of more genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitos throughout their country. Previously in July 2015, Oxitec released results of a test in the Juazeiro region of Brazil, of so-called \\"self-limiting\\" mosquitoes, to fight dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses. They concluded that mosquito populations were reduced by about 95%.  Modified species   Biological research  * Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are model organisms used in an array of biological disciplines (i.e. neurobiology, population genetics, ecology, animal behavior, systematics, genomics, and development). Many studies done with Drosophila species have been foundational in their respective fields, and they remain important models for other organisms, including humans. For example, they have contributed to understanding economically important insects and researching human disease and development. Fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short life cycle, reproduction rate, low maintenance requirements, and amenability to mutagenesis. They are also the model genetic organism for historical reasons, being one of the first model organism and have a high quality completed genome.  Genetic pest management  * Yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) * Malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi) * Pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella)  Diamondback moth  Diamondback moth The diamondback moth's caterpillars gorge on cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and kale, globally costing farmers an estimated $5 billion (¬£3.2 billion) a year worldwide. In 2015, Oxitec developed GM-diamondback moths which produce non- viable female larvae to control populations able to develop resistance to insecticides. The GM-insects were initially placed in cages for field trials. Earlier, the moth was the first crop pest to evolve resistance to DDT and eventually became resistant to 45 other insecticides. In Malaysia, the moth has become immune to all synthetic sprays. The gene is a combination of DNA from a virus and a bacterium. In an earlier study, captive males carrying the gene eradicated communities of non-GM moths. Brood sizes were similar, but female offspring died before reproducing. The gene itself disappears after a few generations, requiring ongoing introductions of GM cultivated males. Modified moths can be identified by their red glow under ultraviolet light, caused by a coral transgene. Opponents claim that the protein made by the synthetic gene could harm non-target organisms that eat the moths. The creators claim to have tested the gene's protein on mosquitoes, fish, beetles, spiders and parasitoids without observing problems. Farmers near the test site claim that moths could endanger nearby farms' organic certification. Legal experts say that national organic standards penalize only deliberate GMO use. The creators claim that the moth does not migrate if sufficient food is available, nor can it survive winter weather. Mediterranean fruit fly Mediterranean fruit fly The Mediterranean fruit fly is a global agricultural pest. They infest a wide range of crops (over 300) including wild fruit, vegetables and nuts, and in the process, cause substantial damage. The company Oxitec has developed GM-males which have a lethal gene that interrupts female development and kills them in a process called \\"pre-pupal female lethality\\". After several generations, the fly population diminishes as the males can no longer find mates. To breed the flies in the laboratory, the lethal gene can be \\"silenced\\" using the antibiotic tetracycline. Opponents argue that the long-term effects of releasing millions of GM-flies are impossible to predict. Dead fly larvae could be left inside crops. Helen Wallace from Genewatch, an organisation that monitors the use of genetic technology, stated \\"Fruit grown using Oxitec's GM flies will be contaminated with GM maggots which are genetically programmed to die inside the fruit they are supposed to be protecting\\". She added that the mechanism of lethality was likely to fail in the longer term as the GM flies evolve resistance or breed in sites contaminated with tetracycline which is widely used in agriculture. Legislation In July 2015, the House of Lords (U.K.) Science and Technology Committee launched an inquiry into the possible uses of GM-insects and their associated technologies. The scope of the inquiry is to include questions such as \\"Would farmers benefit if insects were modified in order to reduce crop pests? What are the safety and ethical concerns over the release of genetically modified insects? How should this emerging technology be regulated?\\"  Notes and references   See also  * Inherited sterility in insects * List of sterile insect technique trials * Insect ecology * Detection of genetically modified organisms External links * Transgenic Fly Virtual Lab - Howard Hughes Medical Institute BioInteractive * Genetically modified organisms ","title":"Genetically modified insect"},{"id":"25174722","title":"Tonight Carmen"},{"id":"25174734","text":"Pandari is a small village in East Champaran district of Bihar state, India.

He was born as the only child to Ashangbam Jivan Singh and Medhabati Devi on 2 May 1906. His grandfather Ashang Kut, also known as Ashangbam Phura Hongba, served as a soldier in The Maharaja of Manipur's army. In March 1891 he played a part in the assassination of British officials and was thereby sentenced for transportation on charge of murder. He was sentenced twenty five years of life imprisonment at Kalapani Jail, which is now located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Early life, education and career Minaketan was born at Wangkhei in Ashangbam family but was brought up in the family of royal descendants of Maharaja Nara Singh by Sanajaobi Devi, the grand daughter of Raja Nara Singh at Moirangkhom Sougaijam Leirak. He graduated from the University of Calcutta in 1930 and by that time he had mastered English, Bengali, Hindi, Sanskrit and the Old Meitei languages with utmost fluency. He belonged to the generation which had grown up and saw the difficult times of Manipur in the socio-economic condition under the monarchic system of Govt shaped by the colonial rule of British Empire. But at the same time, the early part of the 20th century was a glorious year, a transcendental period what we call the renaissance period of Meitei literature. Minaketan worked as Secretary, Board of Secondary Education, Manipur, Lecturer of Manipur College (1962‚Äì82), Principal, Thoubal College (1982‚Äì83); His works Minaketan engaged with every field of literature: poetry, prose, essays, translations, mythology, biography, autobiography, and criticism. His published works numbered more than 25 books on these different branches of literature. Some of his works are Basanta Sheireng (Poetry), 1928; Asheibagi Nityaipod (Poetry), 1976; Asheibagi Sheirol, 1977; Tonu Laijinglembi (Play); Bharatki Lonsingi Marakta (Essay); Meitei Upanyas (Criticism). Ashangbam Minaketan Singh is a name to reckon with among the pioneer poets of Meitei literature. He had associated himself with many State advisory committees. In short, Minaketan himself was an institution, a school of variety of thoughts. One inimitable quality which keeps Minaketan apart from other poets, which makes him occupy a special place in the annals of Manipur literature, is his invention of new words purely from Old Meitei languages spoken in the old days. In Minaketan's poetry, people come across obscure and recondite words or references which are too difficult to understand at the first reading. The vast learning and the vast knowledge he had acquired is expressed in such a twisted manner that it becomes difficult to follow what the poet really intends to say. About Minaketan's style and choice of words, poet Shree Biren has this observation ‚Äì It is a fact that any reader will find himself a kind of push which violently thrown out at the very threshold. To know the true Minaketan a reader must face this kind of repulsion and must try to open the door and if one had succeeded to open the door of his treasure house then he will surely enjoy the beauty in the writings and words of Minaketan. Minaketan had the power of impressing the imagination by lines of spleen-dour and magnificence suggesting some half-expressed thoughts, some dimly shadowed emotions. In the twilight years of his life he had seen the mother in every woman even in his own daughter. In his poem 'Sanarik Pareng' he penned 'My loving daughter/ you are my mother/ My mother in you darling'. The sense of vastness and immensity is suggested in several lines of his poem 'Bidai Ashirbad'. The mystery of life is exquisitely and yet mystically suggested: Premna Lingba Jagatnido Puba-nido Premna/''' Pubanido Premna Tengbal Hingba- nido Premna''' (Love makes the universe love binds the universe/ love gives soul to the world) The body and the soul are united for him with love to the whole of universe. '' In his last poem 'Yachang Sheirol Khameen Tengtha' there is an expression of a communion with god with his love of motherland. Awards During his lifetime he was honoured and decorated with many titles and awards Sahitya Ratna (from Manipuri Sahitya Parishat(1971), Sahitya Academy Award in Asheibagi Nityaipod (Poetry)(1977), Soviet Land Nehru Award(1977), Kavi Samrat (from Thangal Marup, Hailakandi, Cachhar 1980), the most eminent citizen of Manipur (1985), Padma Shri (1985),Shubharna Jayanti Sanman Award(1986), Jamini Sunder Guha Gold Medal (1988), Thoibi Award (1988), Lalit Memorial Gold Medal (1990) and many, many more prestigious awards. Death and legacy Minaketan lived a fruitful long 89 years even having to see and play with his youngest grandson, encompassing the whole of the 20th century. He died of a heart attack in 1995 leaving behind his family and above all his legacy in Meitei literature. He was the representative of the Meitei Literature in the whole of 20th century.

Biography Birthplace of Humperdinck Humperdinck was born at Siegburg in the Rhine Province in 1854. After receiving piano lessons, he produced his first composition at the age of seven. His first attempts at works for the stage were two singspiele written when he was 13. His parents disapproved of his plans for a career in music and encouraged him to study architecture. Nevertheless, he began taking music classes under Ferdinand Hiller and Isidor Seiss at the Cologne Conservatory in 1872. In 1876, he won a scholarship that enabled him to go to Munich, where he studied with Franz Lachner and later with Josef Rheinberger. In 1879, he won the first Mendelssohn Award given by the Mendelssohn Stiftung (foundation) in Berlin. He went to Italy and became acquainted with Richard Wagner in Naples. Wagner invited him to join him in Bayreuth, and during 1880 and 1881 Humperdinck assisted in the production of Parsifal. He also served as music tutor to Wagner's son, Siegfried.\\"Humperdinck, Engelbert\\" by Ian Denley, Grove Music Online After winning another prize, Humperdinck traveled through Italy, France, and Spain and spent two years teaching at the Gran Teatre del Liceu Conservatory in Barcelona. In 1887, he returned to Cologne. He was appointed professor at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt in 1890 and also teacher of harmony at Julius Stockhausen's Vocal School. By this time he had composed several works for chorus and a Humoreske for small orchestra, which enjoyed a vogue in Germany. H√§nsel und Gretel Humperdinck's reputation rests chiefly on his opera H√§nsel und Gretel, on which he began work in Frankfurt in 1890.Plaque: Scheffelstra√üe 1, Frankfurt am Main: \\"Engelbert Humperdinck komponierte in diesem Hause in den Jahren 1891 bis 1892 die Oper ‚Ä∫H√§nsel und Gretel‚Äπ\\" [Engelbert Humperdinck composed in this house in the years 1891 to 1892 the opera H√§nsel und Gretel] He first composed four songs to accompany a puppet show his nieces were giving at home. Then, using a libretto by his sister Adelheid Wette rather loosely based on the version of the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, he composed a singspiel of 16 songs with piano accompaniment and connecting dialogue. By January 1891 he had begun working on a complete orchestration. The opera premiered in Weimar on 23 December 1893, under the baton of Richard Strauss. With its highly original synthesis of Wagnerian techniques and traditional German folk songs, Hansel and Gretel was an instant and overwhelming success. Hansel and Gretel has always been Humperdinck's most popular work. In 1923 the Royal Opera House (London) chose it for their first complete radio opera broadcast. Eight years later, it was the first opera transmitted live from the Metropolitan Opera (New York). Later career Engelbert Humperdinck In 1896, Kaiser Wilhelm II made Humperdinck a Professor and he went to live at Boppard. Four years later, however, he went to Berlin where he was appointed head of a Meister-Schule of composition. His students included the Basque composer Andr√©s Isasi. Among his other stage works are: *Die sieben Gei√ülein (The Seven Little Kids), 1895 *K√∂nigskinder (King's Children), 1897, 1910 *Dornr√∂schen (Sleeping Beauty), 1902 *Die Heirat wider Willen (The Reluctant Marriage), 1905 *B√ºbchens Weihnachtstraum (The Christmas Dream), 1906 *Die Marketenderin (The Provisioner), 1914 *Gaudeamus: Szenen aus dem deutschen Studentenleben (Gaudeamus igitur: Scenes from German Student Life), 1919 While composing those works, Humperdinck held various teaching positions of distinction and collaborated in the theater, providing incidental music for a number of Max Reinhardt's productions in Berlin, for example, for Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice in 1905.J. L. Styan, Modern Drama in Theory and Practice: Volume 3 Expressionism and Epic Theatre (Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 65 Although recognized as a disciple of Wagner rather than an innovator, Humperdinck was nevertheless the first composer to use Sprechgesang‚Äîa vocal technique halfway between singing and speaking‚Äîin his melodrama K√∂nigskinder (1897). In 1914, Humperdinck seems to have applied for the post of director of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in Australia, but with the outbreak of World War I it became unthinkable for a German to hold that position, and the job went instead to Belgium's Henri Verbrugghen.\\"Popper in Australasia, 1937‚Äì1945\\", Quadrant (June 2000) at www.accessmylibrary.com Also in 1914, Humperdinck signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, declaring support for German military actions during early World War I.Professors of Germany. \\"To the Civilized World\\". North American Review, Vol. 210, No. 765 (Aug., 1919), pp. 284‚Äì287 On 5 January 1912 Humperdinck suffered a severe stroke. Although he recovered, his left hand remained permanently paralyzed. He continued to compose, completing Gaudeamus with the help of his son, Wolfram, in 1918. On 26 September 1921 Humperdinck attended a performance of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz in Neustrelitz, Wolfram's first effort as a stage director. He suffered a heart attack during the performance and died the next day from a second heart attack. The Berlin State Opera performed Hansel and Gretel in his memory a few weeks later. He was buried at the in Stahnsdorf near Berlin. For a list of Humperdinck's pupils, see this list. In 1965, British singer Arnold Dorsey named himself after the composer.

Insects may be farmed for the commodities they produce (like silk, honey, lac or insect tea), or for them themselves; to be used as food, as feed, as a dye, and otherwise. Farming of popular insects  Silkworms  Silkworms, the caterpillars of the domestic silkmoth, are kept to produce silk, an elastic fiber made when they are in the process of creating a cocoon. Silk is commonly regarded as a major cash crop and is used in the crafting of many textiles.  Mealworms  The mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) is the larvae form of a species of darkling beetles (Coleoptera). The optimum incubation temperature is 25 ÃäC - 27 ÃäC and its embryonic development lasts 4 ‚Äì 6 days. It has a long larvae period of about half a year with the optimum temperature and low moisture terminates. The protein content of Tenebrio Molitor larvae, adult, exuvium and excreta are 46.44, 63.34, 32.87, and 18.51% respectively.  Buffaloworms  Buffaloworms, also called lesser mealworms, is the common name of Alphitobius diaperinus. Its larvae superficially resemble small wireworms or true mealworms (Tenebrio spp.). They are approximately 7 to 11 mm in length at last instar. Freshly-emerged larvae are a milky color. The pale color tinge returns to that of the first/second instar larva when preparing to molt, while a yellowish-brown appearance after molting. In addition, it was reported that it has the highest level of iron bioavailability.  Honeybees  Commodities harvested from honeybees include beeswax, bee bread, bee pollen, propolis, royal jelly, brood, and honey. All of the aforementioned are mostly used in food, however, being wax, beeswax has many other uses, such as being used in candles, and propolis may be used as a wood finish. In recent years, wild populations of honeybees have declined significantly.  Lac insects  Lac insects secrete a resinous substance called lac. Lac is used in many applications, from its use in food to being used as a colorant or as a wood finish. The majority of lac farming takes place in India and Thailand, with over 2 million residential employees.  Cochineal  Made into a red dye known as carmine, cochineal are incorporated into many products, including cosmetics, food, paint, and fabric. About 100,000 insects are needed to make a single kilogram of dye. The shade of red the dye yields depends on how the insect is processed. France is the world‚Äôs largest importer of carmine. Crickets Cricket Shelter Modular Edible Insect Farm, designed by Terreform ONE Among the hundreds of different types of crickets, the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) is the most common type used for human consumption. The cricket is one of the most nutritious edible insects, and in many parts of the world, crickets are consumed dry-roasted, baked, deep-fried, and boiled. Cricket consumption may take the form of cricket flour, a powder of dried and ground crickets, which is easily integrated in to many food recipes. Crickets are commonly farmed for non-human animal food, as they provide much nutrition to the many species of reptiles, fish, birds and other mammals that consume them. Crickets are normally killed by deep freezing, where they feel no pain and are sedated before neurological death.  Waxworms  Waxworms are the larvae of wax moths. These caterpillars are used widely across the world for food, fish bait, animal testing and plastic degradation. Low in protein but high in fat content, they are a valuable source of fat for many insectivorous organisms. Waxworms are popular in many parts of the world, due to their ability to live in low temperatures and their simplicity in production. Cockroaches Cockroaches are farmed by the million in China, and became an area of growth in the early 2000s.  As feed and food  Insects are promising to be used as animal feed. For instance, fly larvae can replace fish meal due to the similar amino acid composition. It is possible to formulate fish meal to increase unsaturated fatty acid. Wild birds and free-range poultry can consume insects inform an adult, larval and pupal naturally. Grasshoppers and moth, as well as the housefly, are reported as the feed supplements of poultry. Apart from that, insects have the potential as the feeds for reptile, soft monkey as well as birds. Insects are also farmed as food for human consumption (entomophagy). Entomophagy has lasted for as long as, as some sources suggest, 30,000 years. Insects are becoming increasingly viable as a source of protein in the modern diet, as conventional meat forms are very land-intensive and produce large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas. Insects bred in captivity offer a low space-intensive, highly feed efficient, relatively pollution-free, high-protein source of food for both humans and non-human animals. Insects have a high nutritional value, dense protein content and micronutrient and probiotic potential. Insects such as crickets and mealworms have high concentrations of complete protein, vitamin B12, riboflavin and vitamin A. Insects offer an economical solution to increasingly pressing food security and environmental issues concerning the production and distribution of protein to feed a growing world population. Hundreds of species of crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, moths and various other insects are farmed for human consumption. Benefits Purported benefits of entomophagy include: * Significantly less amounts resource and space use, less amounts of waste produced, and emissions of very trace amounts of greenhouse gases. * They include many vitamins and essential minerals, contain dietary fiber (which is not present in meat), and are a complete protein. The protein count of 100 g of cricket is nearly equivalent to the amount in 100 g of lean ground beef. * As opposed to meat, lower costs are required to care for and produce insects. * Faster growth and reproduction rates. Crickets mature rather quickly and are typically full-grown within 3 weeks to a month, and an individual female can lay from 1,200 to 1,500 eggs in three to four weeks. Cattle, however, become adults at 2 years, and the breeding ratio is four breeding animals for each market animal produced. * Unlike meat, insects rarely transmit diseases such as H1N1, mad cow disease, or salmonella. = Reduced feed = Cattle use 12 times the amount of feed that crickets do to produce an equal amount of protein. Crickets also only use a quarter of the feed of sheep and one half the amount of feed given to swine and chicken to produce an equivalent amount of protein. Crickets require only two pounds of feed to produce one pound of the finished product. Much of this efficiency is a result of crickets being ectothermic, as in they get their heat from the environment instead of having to expend energy to create their own body heat as typical mammals do. = Nutrient efficiency = Insects are nutrient efficient compared to other meat sources. The insect protein content is comparable to most meat products. Likewise, the fatty acid composition of edible insects is comparable to fish lipids, with high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs). In addition, all parts on edible insect are efficiently used however, some parts on conventional livestock are not directly available for human consumption The nutritional contents of insects vary with species as well as within species depending on their metamorphic stage, their habitat and their diet. For instance, the lipid composition of insects is largely dependent on their diet and metamorphic stage. Insect is abundant in other nutrients, Locusts for example contain between 8 and 20 milligrams of iron for every 100 grams of raw locust. Beef on the other hand contains roughly 6 milligrams of iron in the same amount of meat. Crickets as well are very efficient compared to their nutrients. For every 100 grams of substance crickets contain 12.9 grams of protein, 121 calories, and 5.5 grams of fat. Beef contains more protein containing 23.5 grams in 100 grams of substance, but also has roughly 3 times the calories, and four times the amount of fat as crickets do in 100 grams. So, per 100 grams of substance, crickets contain only half the nutrients of beef, except for iron. High levels of iron are implicated in bowel cancer and heart disease. When considering the protein transition, cold-blood insects are enabling to convert food more efficiently: crickets only need 2.1 kg feed for 1 kg ‚Äòmeat‚Äô while poultry and cows need about more than 2 times and 12 times of the feed = Greenhouse gas emissions = The raising of livestock is responsible for 18% of all greenhouse gases emitted. Alternative sources of protein, such as insects, replace protein sourced from livestock and help decrease the number of greenhouse gases emitted from food production. Insect raising has negligible emissions compared to livestock since no farmed insect species besides termites release methane, and none create ammonia. = Land usage = Livestock raising accounts for 70% of agricultural land use. This results in a land-cover change which destroys local ecosystems and displaces people and wildlife. Insect farming is minimally space intensive compared to other conventional livestock, and can even take place in populated urban centers.  Processing methods  With the concerning on animal health and welfare about the tolerance on pain, processing on the insects can be mainly concluded as: harvesting and cleaning, inactivation, heating and drying depending on the final product and rearing methods.  Harvesting and cleaning  Insects at different life stages can be collected by sieving followed by water cleaning when it is necessary to remove biomass or excretion. Before processing, the insects are sieved and stored alive at 4 ‚ÑÉ for about one day without any feed.  Inactivation  An inactivation step is needed to inactive any enzymes and microbes on the insects. The enzymatic browning reaction (mainly phenolase or phenol oxidase) can cause the brown or black color on the insect, which leads to discoloration and the off-flavor.  Heat-treatment  Sufficient heat treatment is required to kill enterobacteriaceae so that the product can meet the safety requirement. D-value and Z-value can be used to estimate the effectiveness of heat treatments. The temperature and duration of the heating will cause insect proteins' denaturation and changes the functional properties of proteins.  Drying  To prevent spoilage, the products are dried to lower the moisture content and prolong the shelf life. Longer drying time results from a low evaporation rate due to the chitin layer, which can prevent the insect from dehydration during their lifetime. So the product in granules form give the advantages of further drying. In general, insects have a moisture level in the range of 55-65%. A drying process decreasing the moisture content to a level of less than 10% is good for preservation. Besides the moisture level, oxidation of lipids can cause high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in products. Hence the processing steps influencing the final fat stability in products are necessary to be considered during drying.  Regulations in Europe  The use of insect meal as feed and food is limited by the legislation. Insects can be used in Novel Food according to the guidelines for market authorization of products of the European Union. The European Union Commission accepted the use of insects for fish feed in July 2017. However, the power to promote the scale-up of insects production becomes difficult when only a few participate in this market to change the rules. In Europe, safety documents for certain insects and accompanying products are required by the European Union (EFSA) and NVWA.

Slaines was taken by James VI on 30 May 1589 and a royal garrison put in.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 55, 61. In 1594, Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll led a rebellion which was put down by James VI. The castle was destroyed with gunpowder and cannon on 1 November.Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 1 (London, 1754), p. 192. Next year, Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll, a friend of Anne of Denmark, hired masons to repair the building.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 10 no. 8. After returning from exile, Hay built a New Slains Castle on the site of the former Bowness Castle near Cruden Bay.  Structure  Originally a strongly built 5-storey oblong keep (of which a small part remains), a wall defending the landward side was added in the early 16th century.  Modern day  One wall of the castle remains standing, at approximately in height. In the 1950s, a 3-storey house was built within the ruins, adjoining a fishing cottage built in the 18th century. Since 1991 several archaeological excavations have been effected, the last one in 2007. The remains of the old castle are designated a scheduled ancient monument.

The course of the river runs through the provinces of Teruel and Zaragoza. It has a length of and an average flow rate of , although this varies between the seasons. The river flows in a generally north easterly direction from its source near Monreal del Campo. The valley was an historic route between the Meseta Central and the Mediterranean coast. Roman bridges remain in many pueblos and remains of watermills can be seen. The water is generally of good quality and supports a range of wildlife. Cleaning works by the regional government have been criticised by environmental organisations who claim that the ecology has been damaged. The watershed covers an area of . Course The source is disputed, tradition holds that it rises at an artesian well, the Fuente de Cella, at the base of the Sierra Albarrac√≠n in Teruel province. The well is surrounded by an elliptical parapet wall built by the Italian engineer Domingo Ferrari. It is now thought that the stretch of river between Cella and Monreal del Campo is the remains of an 18th-century canal which was cut to drain the Laguna Ca√±izar at Villarquemado. It is currently accepted that the Jiloca raises at the Ojos (Eyes) of Monreal, from the town. These are a series of ponds linked by channels. From Monreal the river flows northwards and near Luco de Jiloca (Calamocha), the Jiloca is joined by its only tributary, the Pancrudo, which rises away in the Sierra de la Costera. From this point there is an irrigation channel which waters a small valley near Daroca. The river flows on from Daroca in a north easterly direction, past Manchones, Morero, Mont√≥n, Morata de Jiloca, Maruenda and Paracuellos de Jiloca until it joins the Jal√≥n between Carramolina and Calatayud. Towns named after the river are Morata de Jiloca, Paracuellos de Jiloca, Fuentes de Jiloca, Torremocha de Jiloca, Velilla de Jiloca and Villanueva de Jiloca. Hydrographics The Jiloca has an average flow rate of , although there are seasonal variations, due to a long dry season and wet seasons in the spring and autumn in the Meseta Central. Annual rainfall in the watershed varies from around to , with peak precipitation in May and June. The watershed covers an area of . Natural history The Jiloca at the source, Ojos de Monreal The Ojos de Monreal are a series of artesian wells which form pools connected by small channels. This area is rich in wildlife, including waterfowl, grebes, wrens, kingfishers, owls, orioles and woodpeckers. There are frequently visiting wildfowl from the Laguna de Gallocanta, some away. Thickets of poplar, willow and walnut trees give plenty of shelter. The water is considered in very good condition according to the assessment of the Plan Hidrol√≥gico de la Cuenca del Ebro (Hydrological Plan of the Ebro). Further downstream in the valley between Manchones and Morero, birdlife includes goshawks, eagles, orioles, robins, finches, hoopoe and kestrels. Deer and bobcats are found in the Sierra Santa Cruz which borders the river, hedgehogs and shrews are to be found near the banks. Trees include poplars, elm, and ash. In 2000, the Asociaci√≥n Naturalista de Arag√≥n strongly condemned cleaning works by the regional government, which they said were systematically destroying riparian vegetation, killing fish and upsetting the ecology of the river in the reaches between Daroca and Calatayud. In November 2009, an investigation into soil erosion in the Jiloca basin was announced, with the intention of determining suitable future land use strategies.

Gibson first read the story at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, to an audience of four people, among them Bruce Sterling (whom Gibson later said \\"completely got it\\"). It was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1983The Locus Index to SF Awards. and collected with the rest of Gibson's early short fiction in a 1986 volume of the same name. Plot \\"Burning Chrome\\" tells the story of two freelance hackers‚ÄîAutomatic Jack, the narrator and a hardware specialist; and Bobby Quine, a software expert. Bobby becomes infatuated with a girl named Rikki and wants to become wealthy in order to impress her. Jack has acquired a powerful Russian \\"icebreaker\\" program that can penetrate corporate security systems. Bobby suggests that they use it to break into the system of a notorious and vicious criminal known as Chrome, who handles money transfers for organized crime, and Jack reluctantly agrees to help. The break-in is successful, and Jack and Bobby empty Chrome's bank accounts, but they discover afterward that Rikki had been working in a brothel with ties to Chrome. She uses her earnings to buy a set of cybernetic eye implants for herself and go to Hollywood; however, Jack uses his money to switch her plane ticket to Chiba City, where Rikki has always dreamed of going. He buys her a return ticket as well but she never uses it. The news leaves both men devastated, as they have grown to love her, and Jack never sees her again. Connection to other works The story was one of the first of Gibson's to be set in the Sprawl, and functioned as a conceptual prototype for Gibson's Sprawl trilogy of novels. Bobby Quine is mentioned in Neuromancer as one of the mentors of the protagonist. The Finn, a recurring character in Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, makes his first appearance in this story as a minor figure. The events of the story are referenced in Count Zero, the second entry of the Sprawl trilogy. Reception  The word \\"cyberspace\\", coined by Gibson, was first used in this story, in reference to the \\"mass consensual hallucination\\" in computer networks. One line from the story‚Äî\\"...the street finds its own uses for things\\"‚Äîhas become a widely quoted aphorism for describing the sometimes unexpected uses to which users can put technologies (for example, hip-hop DJs' reinvention of the turntable, which transformed turntables from a medium of playback into one of production). Gibson wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow, but the project did not come to fruition. The BBC did an hour-long version of the story, first broadcast on BBC Radio 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra) on 19 Oct 2007 and read by Adam Sims.

These organisms are now used for several purposes, and are particularly important in producing large amounts of pure human proteins for use in medicine.  History  The first example of this occurred in 1978 when Herbert Boyer, working at a University of California laboratory, took a version of the human insulin gene and inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli to produce synthetic \\"human\\" insulin. Four years later, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Research  Bacteria were the first organisms to be genetically modified in the laboratory, due to the relative ease of modifying their chromosomes. This ease made them important tools for the creation of other GMOs. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be added to a plasmid and inserted into bacteria for storage and modification. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, clonal, multiply quickly, are relatively easy to transform, and can be stored at -80 ¬∞C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria, providing an unlimited supply for research. The large number of custom plasmids make manipulating DNA excised from bacteria relatively easy. Their ease of use has made them great tools for scientists looking to study gene function and evolution. Most DNA manipulation takes place within bacterial plasmids before being transferred to another host. Bacteria are the simplest model organism and most of our early understanding of molecular biology comes from studying Escherichia coli. Scientists can easily manipulate and combine genes within the bacteria to create novel or disrupted proteins and observe the effect this has on various molecular systems. Researchers have combined the genes from bacteria and archaea, leading to insights on how these two diverged in the past. In the field of synthetic biology, they have been used to test various synthetic approaches, from synthesizing genomes to creating novel nucleotides.  Food  Bacteria have been used in the production of food for a long time, and specific strains have been developed and selected for that work on an industrial scale. They can be used to produce enzymes, amino acids, flavourings, and other compounds used in food production. With the advent of genetic engineering, new genetic changes can easily be introduced into these bacteria. Most food-producing bacteria are lactic acid bacteria, and this is where the majority of research into genetically engineering food-producing bacteria has gone. The bacteria can be modified to operate more efficiently, reduce toxic byproduct production, increase output, create improved compounds, and remove unnecessary pathways. Food products from genetically modified bacteria include alpha- amylase, which converts starch to simple sugars, chymosin, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase, which improves fruit juice clarity.Panesar, Pamit et al. (2010) Enzymes in Food Processing: Fundamentals and Potential Applications, Chapter 10, I K International Publishing House,  In cheese  Chymosin is an enzyme found in a calf's stomach. This helps the calf break down the milk to digest. Chymosin is necessary in order to make cheese. It turns the milk into cheese. Scientists have found a way to alter yeast to grow Chymosin enzymes for making cheese. This process is much more efficient because previously calves had to be slaughtered in order to extract the Chymosin from the inner lining of the stomach. Also this offers a vegetarian friendly way to make cheese. it depends on what and how the Bactria does the process.  Industrial  Genetically modified bacteria are used to produce large amounts of proteins for industrial use. Generally the bacteria are grown to a large volume before the gene encoding the protein is activated. The bacteria are then harvested and the desired protein purified from them. The high cost of extraction and purification has meant that only high value products have been produced at an industrial scale. Pharmaceutical production The majority of the industrial products from bacteria are human proteins for use in medicine. Many of these proteins are impossible or difficult to obtain via natural methods and they are less likely to be contaminated with pathogens, making them safer. Prior to recombinant protein products, several treatments were derived from cadavers or other donated body fluids and could transmit diseases. Indeed, transfusion of blood products had previously led to unintentional infection of haemophiliacs with HIV or hepatitis C; similarly, treatment with human growth hormone derived from cadaver pituitary glands may have led to outbreaks of Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. The first medicinal use of GM bacteria was to produce the protein insulin to treat diabetes. Other medicines produced include clotting factors to treat haemophilia, human growth hormone to treat various forms of dwarfism, interferon to treat some cancers, erythropoietin for anemic patients, and tissue plasminogen activator which dissolves blood clots. Outside of medicine they have been used to produce biofuels.Summers, Rebecca (24 April 2013) \\"Bacteria churn out first ever petrol-like biofuel\\" New Scientist, Retrieved 27 April 2013 There is interest in developing an extracellular expression system within the bacteria to reduce costs and make the production of more products economical.  Health  With greater understanding of the role that the micobiome plays in human health, there is the potential to treat diseases by genetically altering the bacteria to, themselves, be therapeutic agents. Ideas include altering gut bacteria so they destroy harmful bacteria, or using bacteria to replace or increase deficient enzymes or proteins. One research focus is to modify Lactobacillus, bacteria that naturally provide some protection against HIV, with genes that will further enhance this protection. The bacteria which generally cause tooth decay have been engineered to no longer produce tooth-corroding lactic acid. These transgenic bacteria, if allowed to colonize a person's mouth, could perhaps reduce the formation of cavities. Transgenic microbes have also been used in recent research to kill or hinder tumors, and to fight Crohn's disease. If the bacteria do not form colonies inside the patient, the person must repeatedly ingest the modified bacteria in order to get the required doses. Enabling the bacteria to form a colony could provide a more long-term solution, but could also raise safety concerns as interactions between bacteria and the human body are less well understood than with traditional drugs. One example of such an intermediate, which only forms short-term colonies in the gastrointestinal tract, may be Lactobacillus Acidophilus MPH734. This is used as a specific in the treatment of Lactose Intolerance. This genetically modified version of Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria produces a missing enzyme called lactase which is used for the digestion of lactose found in dairy products or, more commonly, in food prepared with dairy products. The short term colony is induced over a one-week, 21-pill treatment regimen, after which, the temporary colony can produce lactase for three months or more before it is removed from the body by a natural processes. The induction regimen can be repeated as often as necessary to maintain protection from the symptoms of lactose intolerance, or discontinued with no consequences, except the return of the original symptoms. There are concerns that horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria could have unknown effects. As of 2018 there are clinical trials underway testing the efficacy and safety of these treatments.  Agriculture  For over a century bacteria have been used in agriculture. Crops have been inoculated with Rhizobia (and more recently Azospirillum) to increase their production or to allow them to be grown outside their original habitat. Application of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and other bacteria can help protect crops from insect infestation and plant diseases. With advances in genetic engineering, these bacteria have been manipulated for increased efficiency and expanded host range. Markers have also been added to aid in tracing the spread of the bacteria. The bacteria that naturally colonise certain crops have also been modified, in some cases to express the Bt genes responsible for pest resistance. Pseudomonas strains of bacteria cause frost damage by nucleating water into ice crystals around themselves. This led to the development of ice- minus bacteria, that have the ice-forming genes removed. When applied to crops they can compete with the ice-plus bacteria and confer some frost resistance. fluorescent proteins.  Other uses  Other uses for genetically modified bacteria include bioremediation, where the bacteria are used to convert pollutants into a less toxic form. Genetic engineering can increase the levels of the enzymes used to degrade a toxin or to make the bacteria more stable under environmental conditions. GM bacteria have also been developed to leach copper from ore, clean up mercury pollution and detect arsenic in drinking water. Bioart has also been created using genetically modified bacteria. In the 1980s artist Joe Davis and geneticist Dana Boyd converted the Germanic symbol for femininity (·õâ) into binary code and then into a DNA sequence, which was then expressed in Escherichia coli. This was taken a step further in 2012, when a whole book was encoded onto DNA. Paintings have also been produced using bacteria transformed with fluorescent proteins.

Also called distributed file systems these file systems rely on redirection to distributed systems, therefore latency and scalability can affect file access depending on where the target systems reside.  History  The Andrew File System attempted to solve this for a campus environment using caching and a weak consistency model to achieve local access to remote files. More recently, global file systems have emerged that combine cloud or any object storage, versioning and local caching to create a single, unified, globally accessible file system that does not rely on redirection to a storage device https://www.google.com/patents/US8566362 but serves files from the local cache while maintaining the single file system and all meta data in the object storage.https://www.google.com/patents/US8661063 As described in Google's patents, advantages of these global file systems include the ability to scale with the object storage, use snapshots stored in the object storage for versioning to replace backup, and create a centrally managed consolidated storage repository in the object storage.

Douglas was appointed guardian to King James III during his minority, and received from him before 1462, some of the spoil accruing from the forfeiture of the Earl of Douglas and his adherents.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 4, 2009. In this episode, Bart goes on a quest to get a baby brother out of jealousy of the sisterly bond Lisa has with Maggie. The episode, written by Matt Selman and directed by Steven Dean Moore, received positive reviews from critics. It was viewed in 7.11 million homes in its original airing in the United States. Plot The entire Simpson family stays at home during a blizzard. The weather's too wild to play outside and the power goes out, so Bart participates in a pretend fashion show put on by his sisters, Lisa and Maggie. When he notices the bond shared by the two girls, Lisa suggests that he's jealous because he does not have a brother to share a similar bond with. That night, Bart dreams about being in a park (called Bro- Town USA) with the Smothers Brothers, the Marx Brothers, the Blues Brothers, the Smith Brothers, the Wright Brothers, the Mario Brothers, the Mannings (Cooper, Eli and Peyton), and even the Terwiliger brothers, (Sideshow Bob and Cecil). Bart awakens with the realization that he actually wants a brother. After getting turned down by Homer (who gives a lengthy monologue detailing why he feels daughters are better than sons), Bart consults with his friends at the bus stop. Nelson advises Bart to trick Marge and Homer into having a baby the same way Nelson's mom tried tricking former basketball player Charles Barkley. Bart's first attempt is to make them a romantic dinner, but Marge and Homer are too stuffed to feel amorous. In his second attempt, Bart leaves a kama sutra DVD in his parents' bedroom, but the two end up injuring themselves after emulating the sex positions. Frustrated, he seeks the advice of Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney, who tell him to hide Marge's birth control pills. Bart replaces Marge's birth control pills with Tic Tacs (just as he did with Mrs. Krabappel's in \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\") and discards the Tic Tacs container that now has the birth control pills inside, which Nelson finds and eats (giving the bully mood swings due to the estrogen ingestion). Marge catches Bart tampering with her pills and he confesses that he wants a brother. While sympathetic to her son, Marge explains that she and Homer are fine with just three kids‚Äîshe also notes that even if she and Homer do ever end up having a fourth child, the baby very well could end up being another girl instead of boy, resulting in Bart having three sisters. Bart goes to a local orphanage and tries adopting a child, but is ultimately turned away for being too young. However, a young boy named Charlie follows Bart home and Bart takes him in as his younger brother. Bart and Charlie do brotherly things together, including playing pranks on Principal Skinner and hanging out at the Kwik-E-Mart. When Lisa insists that Charlie be returned to the orphanage, Bart disregards her and takes Charlie to see a horror movie titled Sever V. The movie terrifies Charlie, which makes Bart realize that being an older brother requires responsibility. On their way back from the movie, Chief Wiggum tries to apprehend Charlie, but the two boys escape and hide in a snowbank. Back in the snowbank, Lisa pleads with Bart to do the right thing and let Charlie be legally adopted by another family. When the children are sealed in by a snowplow (by Barney riding on his Plow King truck), Bart and Charlie urinate on the snow to melt it and open an escape tunnel, much to Lisa's disgust. After taking Charlie back to the orphanage, he's eventually adopted by a family with six daughters, and, much to Charlie's dismay, all six of his new sisters treat him like their personal fashion doll. To cheer Bart up, Homer takes him to see Sever V. Production Matt Selman wrote the episode. The Smothers Brothers (Tom and Dick), Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Cooper Manning and Huell Howser all guest starred as themselves in this episode. Jordan Nagai appeared as Charlie, who pretended to be Bart's brother, while Kim Cattrall made her second Simpsons appearance, voicing Bart's imaginary third sister. Showrunner Al Jean said having the Smothers Brothers, who sing over the end credits, on the show was \\"a dream come true\\". The three Mannings recorded their parts in New Orleans under the supervision of The Simpsons writer Tim Long. Jean said the staff liked Peyton's work on Saturday Night Live, \\"and Cooper is really funny, too. They were really good [in the episode].\\" Cooper commented on recording the episode: \\"It took 20 minutes tops. I did enjoy the experience. [...] You can screw up as much as you want. You just do your lines over and over for a couple of takes, then throw some fake laughs in there. All three of us doing it at the same time on three different microphones. Yeah, I thought it was a lot of fun.\\" Nagai, who starred in the animated film Up, recorded his dialogue alongside Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart. To date, he is the youngest guest star the show has had, being 9 years old at the time. John Frink was promoted to executive producer in this episode. Cultural references Bart's dream of famous brothers include Eli Manning, Peyton Manning, Cooper Manning, the Smothers Brothers, Jake and Elwood Blues from The Blues Brothers, the Wright Brothers, The Marx Brothers, the Smith Brothers, and Nintendo's Mario Brothers. Lisa imagining having a second sister is a parody of Sex and the City, The episode title references The Simpsons season 2 episode Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?. The Movie Bart and Charlie see is a parody of The Saw (franchise) with Billy the Puppet. The scene at the bus stop with Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, and Ralph is a reference to the animated series South Park, in which the four boys parody Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick, respectively, with Otto Mann shouting, \\"Oh my God! I killed Kenny!\\", to which Milhouse replies, \\"Ralph,\\" but Otto replies saying, \\"No, I killed Kenny yesterday. What did I do now?\\". Reception The episode was viewed by 7.11 million people with a Nielsen Rating of 3.2/8 and came in second on the Animation Domination lineup slightly behind Family Guy'. The Simpsons was the third most viewed episode on Fox, after Family Guy and Bones. The episode was 3rd ranked on Fox in the 18-49 rating after Family Guy and Glee and made it at 21 in all. IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.6/10, saying \\"The episode did well by sticking to one main story instead of adding a weaker \\"B\\" storyline to fill the half hour.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ calling it \\"another fine outing\\". Matt Selman was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 63rd Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

Taking place during the events of the film, it follows what Nurses George and A.J. did after Carl Fredricksen left with his house tied to balloons. Due to its budget, all of the animation was done in a limited \\"storyboard\\" style, with some objects moving by keyframes, while other things like characters and their mouths barely move at all; however, the characters' expressions and the story are still conveyed. Plot The short starts out with a scene from Up, where two nurses from the Shady Oaks Retirement Village knock on Carl Fredricksen's door to escort him to the nursing home. As seen in the film, Carl instead takes off in his house, while Russell braces himself underneath it. George and A.J. stare dumbfounded at the sky while their van's alarm goes off (it had been bumped by Carl's house). They continue to stare dumbfounded when they return to the van, and in bed during the night. The next day, a news reporter does a story about sightings of a floating house. She attempts to get George and A.J.'s opinion, but they are still staring dumbfounded. Meanwhile, other senior citizens around the city, including at Shady Oaks, are watching the news report and celebrating Carl's \\"escape\\". A week later, George and A.J. are back at their task of escorting elderly citizens to Shady Oaks in their van. Unfortunately, the seniors have gotten ideas from what Carl did, and every time George and A.J. come to a house to take a person away, the senior living there escapes with their house somehow. Finally, they arrive back at the Shady Oaks Retirement Village, only to find an old man outside the door who yells \\"So long, suckers!\\" and hits his cane against one of many canisters attached to the outside of the building; the other canisters soon follow and spew out a powerful gas. After the man goes inside, the entire building launches into the sky. Still dumbstruck, George and A.J. stare up. A few canisters fall down, and one lands on their van, setting off its alarm again. Suddenly, from behind them, a giant blimp starts to descend. It turns out to be Charles Muntz's Spirit of Adventure dirigible, and Carl is flying it with Russell next to him. The airship lands on top of the van, crushing it and causing to effectively stop its alarm. Carl and Russell climb out and George incredulously says \\"Mr. Fredricksen?\\" They walk past the nurses, and Russell mentions that next time he would like to steer. A.J. turns to George and says \\"That was the craziest thing I've ever seen!\\" They look down to find Dug in front of them. Dug speaks \\"Hi there!\\" through his collar, and George and A.J. are even more shocked than before. Cast * Jason Topolski as George * A.J.

While this attempts to explain how Russell ended up on Carl's porch later in the film, Russell is not seen underneath Carl's house when it takes off in the film. * In Up, Carl's surname is always spelled as Fredricksen. Yet in the news items which are seen crawling across the screen during the news program, his surname is spelled \\"Fredrickson\\" twice, a difference that could be attributed to a mistake on the part of the news media. * The Shady Oaks Retirement Village building blasts off into the sky in this film, yet during the credits of Up, Carl is seen socializing with other residents of the home along with some of Muntz's dogs, implying he ended up living there after the film. * At the end of the short, Carl is seen in the airship without his jacket. Although through most of the end of the film he is seen without a jacket, he does have one at the end in the airship. Home media Instead of being released on DVD like Partly Cloudy, Dug's Special Mission, or any other Pixar short film, George and A.J. was initially released on iTunes as an extra feature that came with a purchase of the film. It was later released to fans of Disney/Pixar on their Facebook page and later to the official Disney/Pixar YouTube page. It was later released on Pixar Short Films Collection Volume 2.

She was the elder daughter of Tsar Alexis and his second wife, Natalia Naryshkina, and the sister of Peter the Great. Life Natalia shared the difficulties of her mother and brother during the regency of her half-sister, Tsarevna Sophia. She was very close to her brother Peter, and the siblings shared a very close relationship. She shared Peter‚Äôs wish to reform Russia to a Western country, and it was said that ‚Äùshe loved everything that her brother liked‚Äù, and she supported his ideas from their childhood. During his reign, Peter always thought it was important to inform his sister about his achievements and the affairs of the state, and every time he won a victory, he either informed her personally or had Golovin and Menshikov do so. She was young when Peter instituted his Western reforms, and in contrast to her half-sisters, it was not hard for her to adjust to the new ideals. Her position was also raised after Peter separated from his first spouse Eudoxia Lopukhina in 1698 and she thereby became the hostess of Peter‚Äôs court. It was at her court that Peter met his lovers Anisya Kirillovna and Varvara Michajlovna Arsen'eva. Natalia was never married, and there is nothing to indicate that Peter ever contemplated arranging a marriage for his sister ‚Äì he preferred to have her with him. In 1708, she moved to Saint Petersburg, but she was often in Moscow as her own palace was not ready (it was built in 1713). Peter gave her the Gatchina estate and built the first palace there for her. Natalia founded the first hospital in Saint Petersburg in her house. In 1706-07, she founded the first Russian theatre in Moscow in her house, with actors taken from the staff of her and Praskovia Saltykova‚Äôs court: the first public Russian theatre was later founded after her example in 1709. In Saint Petersburg, she arranged theatre performances for the court and nobility from 1710. She also wrote plays.

In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the fish which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. transgenesis. GM fish are used in scientific research and kept as pets. They are being developed as environmental pollutant sentinels and for use in aquaculture food production. In 2015, the AquAdvantage salmon was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial production, sale and consumption,Staff (November 2015)FDA Has Determined That the AquAdvantage Salmon is as Safe to Eat as Non-GE Salmon FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration / November 2015 / Retrieved 20 November 2015 making it the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. Some GM fish that have been created have promoters driving an over-production of \\"all fish\\" growth hormone. This results in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including salmonids, carps and tilapias. Critics have objected to GM fish on several grounds, including ecological concerns, animal welfare concerns and with respect to whether using them as food is safe and whether GM fish are needed to help address the world's food needs. History and process The first transgenic fish were produced in China in 1985. As of 2013, approximately 50 species of fish have been subject to genetic modification. This has resulted in more than 400 fish/trait combinations. Most of the modifications have been conducted on food species, such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), tilapia (genus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Generally, genetic modification entails manipulation of DNA. The process is known as cisgenesis when a gene is transferred between organisms that could be conventionally bred, or transgenesis when a gene from one species is added to a different species. Gene transfer into the genome of the desired organism, as for fish in this case, requires a vector like a lentivirus or mechanical/physical insertion of the altered genes into the nucleus of the host by means of a micro syringe or a gene gun.Csiro.

Two species of fish, zebrafish and medaka, are most commonly modified because they have optically clear chorions (shells), develop rapidly, the 1-cell embryo is easy to see and micro-inject with transgenic DNA, and zebrafish have the capability of regenerating their organ tissues.Hackett, P.B., Ekker, S.E. and Essner, J.J. (2004) Applications of transposable elements in fish for transgenesis and functional genomics. Fish Development and Genetics (Z. Gong and V. Korzh, eds.) World Scientific, Inc., Chapter 16, 532-580. They are also used in drug discovery. GM zebrafish are being explored for benefits of unlocking human organ tissue diseases and failure mysteries. For instance, zebrafish are used to understand heart tissue repair and regeneration in efforts to study and discover cures for cardiovascular diseases. Transgenic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been developed to study muscle development. The introduced transgene causes green fluorescence to appear in fast twitch muscle fibres early in development which persist throughout life. It has been suggested the fish might be used as indicators of aquatic pollutants or other factors which influence development. In intensive fish farming, the fish are kept at high stocking densities. This means they suffer from frequent transmission of contagious diseases, a problem which is being addressed by GM research. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have been modified with a transgene coding for human lactoferrin, which doubles their survival rate relative to control fish after exposure to Aeromonas bacteria and Grass carp hemorrhage virus. Cecropin has been used in channel catfish to enhance their protection against several pathogenic bacteria by 2‚Äì4 times. Recreation =Pets= GloFish is a patentedPublished PCT Application WO2000049150 \\"Chimeric Gene Constructs for Generation of Fluorescent Transgenic Ornamental Fish.\\" National University of Singapore technology which allows GM fish (tetra, barb, zebrafish) to express jellyfish and sea coral proteins giving the fish bright red, green or orange fluorescent colors when viewed in ultraviolet light. Although the fish were originally created and patented for scientific research at the National University of Singapore, a Texas company, Yorktown Technologies, obtained rights to market the fish as pets. They became the first genetically modified animal to become publicly available as a pet when introduced for sale in 2003. They were quickly banned for sale in California, however they are now on shelves once again in this state. As of 2013, Glofish are only sold in the US. Other transgenic lines of pet fish include Medaka which remain transparent throughout their lives and pink body color transgenic angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) and lionhead fish expressing the Acropora coral (Acroporo millepora) red fluorescent protein. The ocean pout type III antifreeze protein transgene has been successfully micro-injected and expressed in goldfish. The transgenic goldfish showed higher cold tolerance compared with controls. Food One area of intensive research with GM fish has aimed to increase food production by modifying the expression of growth hormone (GH). The relative increases in growth differ between species.(Figure 1)See figures in . They range from a doubling in weight, to some fish that are almost 100 times heavier than the wild-type at a comparable age. This research area has resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including salmon, trout and tilapia. Other sources indicate an 11-fold and 30-fold increase in growth of salmon and mud loach, respectively, compared to wild-type fish. Transgenic fish development has reached the stage where several species are ready to be marketed in different countries, for example, GM tilapia in Cuba, GM carp in the People's Republic of China, and GM salmon in the US and Canada. In 2014, it was reported that applications for the approval of transgenic fish as food had been made in Canada, China, Cuba and the United States. Over-production of GH from the pituitary gland increases growth rate mainly by an increase in food consumption by the fish, but also by a 10 to 15% increase in feed conversion efficiency. Another approach to increasing meat production in GM fish is \\"double muscling\\". This results in a phenotype similar to that of Belgian Blue cattle in rainbow trout. It is achieved by using transgenes expressing follistatin, which inhibits myostatin, and the development of two muscle layers. =AquAdvantage salmon= In November 2015, the FDA of the USA approved the AquAdvantage salmon created by AquaBounty for commercial production, sale and consumption. It is the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. The fish is essentially an Atlantic salmon with a single gene complex inserted: a growth hormone regulating gene from a Chinook salmon with a promoter sequence from an ocean pout. This permits the GM salmon to produce GH year round rather than pausing for part of the year as do wild-type Atlantic salmon. The wild-type salmon takes 24 to 30 months to reach market size (4‚Äì6 kg) whereas the GM salmon require 18 months for the GM fish to achieve this.Environmental Assessment for AquAdvantage Salmon AquaBounty argue that their GM salmon can be grown nearer to end- markets with greater efficiency (they require 25% less feed to achieve market weight) than the Atlantic salmon which are currently reared in remote coastal fish farms, thereby making it better for the environment, with recycled waste and lower transport costs. To prevent the genetically modified fish inadvertently breeding with wild salmon, all the fish raised for food are females, triploid, and 99% are reproductively sterile. The fish are raised in a facility in Panama with physical barriers and geographical containment such as river and ocean temperatures too high to support salmon survival to prevent escape. The FDA has determined AquAdvantage would not have a significant effect on the environment in the United States. A fish farm is also being readied in Indiana where the FDA has approved importation of salmon eggs. As of August 2017, GMO salmon is being sold in Canada. Sales in the US are expected to start in the second half of 2019. Detecting aquatic pollution (potential) Several research groups have been developing GM zebrafish to detect aquatic pollution. The laboratory that developed the GloFish originally intended them to change color in the presence of pollutants, as environmental sentinels.National University of Singapore Enterprise webpage Teams at the University of Cincinnati and Tulane University have been developing GM fish for the same purpose. Several transgenic methods have been used to introduce target DNA into zebrafish for environmental monitoring, including micro- injection, electroporation, particle gun bombardment, liposome-mediated gene transfer, and sperm-mediated gene transfer. Micro-injection is the most commonly used method to produce transgenic zebrafish as this produces the highest survival rate. Regulation The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a fish not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. The US FDA guidelines for evaluating transgenic animals define transgenic constructs as \\"drugs\\" regulated under the animal drug provisions of the Federal Food and Cosmetic Act. This classification is important for several reasons, including that it places all GM food animal permits under the jurisdiction of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and imposes limits on what information the FDA can release to the public, and furthermore, it avoids a more open food safety review process. The US states of Washington and Maine have imposed permanent bans on the production of transgenic fish. Controversy Critics have objected to use of genetic engineering per se on several grounds, including ethical concerns, ecological concerns (especially about gene flow), and economic concerns raised by the fact GM techniques and GM organisms are subject to intellectual property law. GMOs also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether using GM fish as safe is safe, whether it would exacerbate or cause fish allergies, whether it should be labeled, and whether GM fish and crops are needed to address the world's food needs. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in most countries. There is much doubt among the public about genetically modified animals in general. It is believed that the acceptance of GM fish by the general public is the lowest of all GM animals used for food and pharmaceuticals. Ethical concerns In transgenic fast-growing fish genetically modified for growth hormone, the mosaic founder fish vary greatly in their growth rate, reflecting the highly variable proportion and distribution of transgenic cells in their bodies. Fish with these high growth rates (and their progeny) sometimes develop a morphological abnormality similar to acromegaly in humans, exhibiting an enlarged head relative to the body and a bulging operculum. This becomes progressively worse as the fish ages. It can interfere with feeding and may ultimately cause death. According to a study commissioned by Compassion in World Farming, the abnormalities are probably a direct consequence of growth hormone over-expression and have been reported in GM coho salmon, rainbow trout, common carp, channel catfish and loach, but to a lesser extent in Nile tilapia. In GM coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) there are morphological changes and changed allometry that lead to reduced swimming abilities. They also exhibit abnormal behaviour such as increased levels of activity with respect to feed-intake and swimming. Several other transgenic fish show decreased swimming ability, likely due to body shape and muscle structure. Genetically modified triploid fish are more susceptible to temperature stress, have a higher incidence of deformities (e.g. abnormalities in the eye and lower jaw), and are less aggressive than diploids. Other welfare concerns of GM fish include increased stress under oxygen-deprived conditions caused by increased need for oxygen. It has been shown that deaths due to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in coho salmon are most pronounced in transgenics. It has been suggested the increased sensitivity to hypoxia is caused by the insertion of the extra set of chromosomes requiring a larger nucleus which thereby causes a larger cell overall and a reduction in the surface area to volume ratio of the cell. Ecological concerns An aquaculture enterprise Transgenic fish are usually developed in strains of near-wild origin. These have an excellent capacity for interbreeding with themselves or wild relatives and therefore possess a significant possibility for establishing themselves in nature should they escape biotic or abiotic containment measures. A wide range of concerns about the consequences of genetically modified fish escaping have been expressed. For polyploids, these include the degree of sterility, interference with spawning, competing with resources without contributing to subsequent generations. For transgenics, the concerns include characteristics of the genotype, the function of the gene, the type of the gene, potential for causing pleiotropic effects, potential for interacting with the remainder of the genome, stability of the construct, ability of the DNA construct to transpose within or between genomes. One study, using relevant life history data from the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) predicts that a transgene introduced into a natural population by a small number of transgenic fish will spread as a result of enhanced mating advantage, but the reduced viability of offspring will cause eventual local extinction of both populations. GM coho salmon show greater risk-taking behaviour and better use of limited food than wild-type fish. Transgenic coho salmon have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in a considerably larger body size (>7-fold) compared to non-transgenic salmon. When transgenic and non-transgenic salmon in the same enclosure compete for different levels of food, transgenic individuals consistently outgrow non-transgenic individuals. When food abundance is low, dominant individuals emerge, invariably transgenic, that show strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominate the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability is low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experience population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only non-transgenic salmon have good (72%) survival rates. This has led to the suggestion that these GM fish will survive better than the wild-type when conditions are very poor. Successful artificial transgenic hybridization between two species of loach (genus Misgurnus) has been reported, yet these species are not known to hybridize naturally. GloFish were not considered as an environmental threat because they were less fit than normal zebrafish which are unable to establish themselves in the wild in the US. =AquAdvantage salmon= The FDA has said the AquAdvantage Salmon can be safely contained in land-based tanks with little risk of escape into the wild, however, Joe Perry, former chair of the GM panel of the European Food Safety Authority, has been quoted as saying ‚ÄúThere remain legitimate ecological concerns over the possible consequences if these GM salmon escape to the wild and reproduce, despite FDA assurances over containment and sterility, neither of which can be guaranteed‚Äù. AquaBounty indicates their GM salmon can not interbreed with wild fish because they are triploid which makes them sterile. The possibility of fertile triploids is one of the major short- falls of triploidy being used as a means of bio-containment for transgenic fish. However, it is estimated that 1.1% of eggs remain diploid, and therefore capable of breeding, despite the triploidy process. Others have claimed the sterility process has a failure rate of 5%. Large scale trials using normal pressure, high pressure, or high pressure plus aged eggs for transgenic coho salmon, give triploidy frequencies of only 99.8%, 97.6%, and 97.0%, respectively. AquaBounty also emphasizes that their GM salmon would not survive wild conditions due to the geographical locations where their research is conducted, as well as the locations of their farms. The GH transgene can be transmitted via hybridization of GM AquAdvantage Salmon and the closely related wild brown trout (Salmo trutta). Transgenic hybrids are viable and grow more rapidly than transgenic salmon and other wild-type crosses in conditions emulating a hatchery. In stream mesocosms designed to simulate natural conditions, transgenic hybrids express competitive dominance and suppress the growth of transgenic and non-transgenic salmon by 82% and 54%, respectively. Natural levels of hybridization between these two species can be as high as 41%. Researchers examining this possibility concluded \\"Ultimately, we suggest that hybridization of transgenic fishes with closely related species represents potential ecological risks for wild populations and a possible route for introgression of a transgene, however low the likelihood, into a new species in nature.\\" An article in Slate Magazine in December 2012 by Jon Entine, Director of the Genetic Literacy Project, criticized the Obama Administration for preventing the publication of the environmental assessment (EA) of the AquAdvantage Salmon, which was completed in April 2012 and which concluded that \\"the salmon is safe to eat and poses no serious environmental hazards.\\"Jon Entine for Slate Magazine. Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2012 Is the White House Interfering With a Scientific Review? The Slate article said that the publication of the report was stopped \\"after meetings with the White House, which was debating the political implications of approving the GM salmon, a move likely to infuriate a portion of its base\\".

Career  As a young journalist Christian Palme worked with the Swedish national daily Svenska Dagbladet, Swedish public service radio Sveriges Radio and the news agency United Press International. In 1984 he was appointed correspondent in Denmark for the Swedish national daily Dagens Nyheter and in 1993 he became correspondent in Eastern Europe and the Balkans for Dagens Nyheter. He has also been employed as intelligence analyst with Swedish Military Intelligence and as Public Affairs Adviser with the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia-Hercegovina. As correspondent in the Balkans Palme became known for his impartial coverage of the Yugoslav wars. When the UN Security Council created the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1993 in The Hague, Palme was one of the first journalists to understand its significance. In the following years he wrote a large number of features in Dagens Nyheter on the war crimes tribunalhttp://www.palme.nu/tribunal/DNLankar.html and in 2002 he summarized his observations in the book Om ondskan i v√•r tid ‚Äì S√∂kandet efter r√§ttvisa p√• Balkanhttp://www.palme.nu/tribunal/index.html (Evil in Our time ‚Äì The Quest for Justice in the Balkans), which was hailed by newspaper reviewers as one of the best books on the Balkan wars published in Sweden.http://www.palme.nu/tribunal/reviews.html He later followed up the discussion of war crimes in the Balkans with the documentary film Peace Without Justicehttp://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/ingen-verklig-fred-utan- rattvisa-1.151648 (with Bengt Nilsson, produced and financed by Swedish public service TV Sveriges Television (2003)).

He produced the most thorough visual record of the life and customs of Turkey in the 16th century, to this day a unique source. He was also the first Danish artist of whom a substantial biography is reconstructable and a substantial body of artworks is attributable. { style=\\"float:left;\\"  __TOC__ } Youth and early training Melchior Lorck was born in either 1526 or 1527 as son of a city clerk, Thomas Lorck, in Flensburg in the duchy of Schleswig in present-day Germany.For the family history, see: Lorck-Schierning (1949); see also Wolfgang M√ºller's entry in Allgemeine deutsche Biographie & Neue deutsche Biographie, Vol. 15 (1987). The first document relating to him is the receipt of a royal Danish 4 year travel stipend from the Danish king, Christian III, signed on March 22, 1549 in Flensburg.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1549 ‚Äì March 22 His earliest engravings stem from the years before the travel stipend, starting with rather unsecure copies after Heinrich Aldegrever, but soon developing a fine control of the burin as in the staunchly anti-papal The Pope as a Wild Man from 1545 and the Portrait of Martin Luther from 1548.On this print it says the artist was 21 years old when he created it, which is why one can extrapolate his approximate birth date. With the royal travel stipend Lorck went to southern Germany, settling in Nuremberg around 1550, where he paid tribute to that city's preeminent artist of the previous generation, Albrecht D√ºrer in a portrait print building on Hans Schwarz' portrait medal of the artist. After a visit in Rome in 1551 and what seems to have been a short period of employment at the residence of count palatine Otto Henry in Neuburg an der Donau he worked for the circle of the prominent Fugger family in Augsburg, thereby drawing nearer to the imperial Habsburg family. The years in Turkey Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, 1557, 12.3 √ó 8.8 cm In 1555 Lorck was assigned to the embassy that the German king Ferdinand I (from 1556 Holy Roman Emperor) sent to the so-called Sublime Porte, the court of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Constantinople (Istanbul). The aim of the embassy was to negotiate a settlement over Hungary over which both parties claimed supremacy. After the Ottomans had defeated the Hungarian army in the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, where King Louis II of Hungary died,Louis II of Hungary had been married to Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, a sister of Ferdinand I the so-called Little War in Hungary, part of the Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars, had been raging, with the Ottomans holding the upper hand most of the time. View over the rooftops of Constantinople, 1555-1559, pen and ink, Statens Museum for Kunst, CopenhagenThe embassy, which finally led to a cease-fire in 1562, was led by Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, is renowned for record of it found in the 'Turkish Letters' by Busbecq, published in 1581‚Äì1588 in Antwerp. Of the three and a half years that Lorck spent in the Turkish capital, approximately one and a half were spent with the rest of the entourage in confinement at the caravanserai where the Germans had been installed. In 1555 at the caravanserai, the El√ßi Hanƒ±, Lorck produced engraved portraits of Busbecq and his co-envoys, Ferenc Zay and Antun Vranƒçiƒá (Antonius Verantius), a few drawings of animals and a view over the rooftops of the city from one of the top windows of the lodging. In the periods of greater freedom however, he drew ancient and modern monuments of the city as well as the customs and dresses of the various peoples gathered from all parts of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of his sojourn, he must have been spending extensive time with the Turkish military, as he was later able to portray a large number of different ranks and nationalities in the Ottoman army. Imperial employment Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, allegedly seen by Lorck in Constantinople on February 15, 1559, engraving, 2nd state, 40.7 √ó 28.9 cm. Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst, Department of Prints and Drawings, inv. no. KKSgb6141 Lorck returned to Western Europe in the autumn of 1559. In 1560 he is documented in Vienna, where he stayed until 1566. His drawings of antique monuments of Constantinople and surroundings date from these years. The Arcadius Column, the pedestal of Theodosius the Great's obelisk on the hippodrome and the pedestal of Constantine's Column both represent monuments that are lost today. The monumental Prospect of Constantinople, seen from across the Golden Horn at Galata / Pera was also made at this time. This drawing, 1145 centimeters long and 45 centimeters high, drawn on twenty-one sheets, executed in brown and black ink with some watercolor, teeming with detail, is considered to be one of the hallmarks of early topographic drawing. It also contains the earliest self-portrait of the artist. See the Constantinople Prospect in Leiden's University Library. While in Vienna, Melchior Lorck was contacted both by the brother of the late king Christian III, duke Hans the Elder of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev who demanded his service. Lorck responded willingly, but was eager to excuse himself for being too busy. While finally answering the duke in January 1563, he also sent King Frederik II a letter, containing a lengthy description of his career up to the date.Sometimes referred to as his autobiography, see: Fischer (1990) and Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), doc.no. 1563-January 1 for the full text. In 1562 Melchior Lorck had produced the large engraved bust portraits of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and the Persian envoy in Constantinople, Isma√Øl, which he added to his letters. In the letters, Melchior Lorck asked for funding, which effected a gracious royal gift of 200 Danish rigsdaler, to be handed over to him via his brother, Andreas Lorck, who had himself recently stepped into the king's service in Copenhagen. Soon after he had written to both lords in January 1563, new assignments kept him busy however, and he remained in Vienna for another five years. In 1562, the son of Ferdinand I, Maximilian, had been elected King of the Romans (i.e. emperor-to- be) in Frankfurt am Main, and had since been travelling down the Danube to receive the homage of the cities, with a final stop in Vienna, which prepared itself for a grandiose entry to receive him in March 1563. Melchior Lorck was put in charge of the setting, which meant redressing of both the city itself, with triumphal arches, wine wells and tree-lined streets and of the inhabitants, dressed i Habsburg colours, varying from rank to rank and occupation to occupation.Kayser (1979) In 1564, on February 22, the emperor confirmed the alleged noble status of both Melchior Lorck and his three brothers, Caspar, Balthasar, and Andreas, citing in the elevation document Melchior's Turkish sojourn as the main argument for the elevation. Around the same time, Lorck was employed as Hartschier (from Italian: arciere), an honorary position with an annual salary in the horse guard of the emperor that he would keep until 1579. In 1566, he followed the emperor in a campaign in Hungary that would eventually see the death of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent during the Battle of Szigetv√°r. In December that year the emperor, Maximilian, wrote a rather unusual letter to his ‚Äúcousin‚Äù (i.e. cousin in office), King Frederik II, asking him to receive Melchior Lorck well, as Lorck was to go to Denmark to collect the inheritance after his eldest brother, Caspar, who had been killed in the Northern Seven Years' War between Denmark and Sweden. The letter also demanded the king to let him return to the emperors service, thus foreboding any claim that the king would have on Lorck.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), doc.no. 1566 - December 1. As Melchior travelled north, however, he appears only to have come as far as Flensburg, before making his way south again.It is likely that he met his other brother, the adventurous Andreas, in their hometown and learned how Andreas had just fallen steeply from favour, and perhaps realized that the name Lorck was not advantageous to flash at the Danish court. Anyway, Melchior turned south while his brother entered the service of the enemy and made the bad reputation of his name even worse. In Hamburg In 1567 Melchior Lorck turns up in documents from the council of the city of Hamburg, and seems to remain there at least until 1572, when he draws up his last will and testament in that city.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1572 ‚Äì February 15 Initially, Lorck was employed as cartographer, mapping the lower streams of the river Elbe, from Geesthacht to the sea, in order to support Hamburg's legal claims to the stable rights in a dispute with its neighbor Brunswick-L√ºneburg. The magnificent map resulting from this commission is still in the possession of the State Archives of Hamburg today, where it remains one of the most precious holdings.Lappenberg (1847); Bolland (1964) The Map of the Elbe, 1568, watercolour and body colour over black and red chalk and pen and ink, 1.09 √ó 12.15 m., Hamburg, Staatsarchiv der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg Another important commission for the city was the rebuilding of the city gate Schartor (demolished), which was begun in 1568 and finished in 1570.The documents are reproduced in Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), document nos. 1570 ‚Äì September 17, 1570 ‚Äì October 22, and 1574 ‚Äì August 30. While in Hamburg, Lorck published the turcophobic pamphlet Ein Liedt vom T√ºrcken und Anti-Christ (A Song on the Turk and Antichrist), quite different in tone from his later, more neutrally descriptive renderings of the Turks. In Lorck's testament, one of the only glimpses of a family life shines through as he leaves everything to a certain widow, Anna Schrivers, whom he describes as his betrothed bride. She is never heard of again. Last Lorck was heard of in Hamburg was after his sojourn in Antwerp when in 1574 he finally received his salary and reimbursement for the SchartorFischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), document no. 1574 ‚Äì August 30 and where in 1575 he was called to witness at the Reichskammergericht in a case about the proper belonging of the area east of Hamburg called Vierlande and drew a map to document his statement.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), document no. 1575 ‚Äì June 13; catalogue no. 1575,1. In Antwerp In 1574 Lorck was found in Antwerp, where he seems to have been since 1573. He was one of the first to write an entry into the album amicorum of Abraham Ortelius, and befriended the publisher and engraver Philip Galle, who dedicated Hans Vredeman de Vries‚Äôs book about wells and fountains to him.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1574 ‚Äì n.d. (a) And he worked for the printing press of Christophe Plantin (woodblocks after his design are still found in the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp). Laudatory remarks in the Civitates orbis terrarum of Georg Braun and Frans HogenbergFischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1574 ‚Äì n.d. (b) as well as the portrait of the antiquarian Hubert Goltzius, brother of Hendrik Goltzius, point to the network he was able to establish during his stay in the city. The turbulence of the Dutch Revolt made him leave the city in the summer of 1574, as his letter to Ortelius from October implies.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1574 ‚Äì October 10 Antwerp was the most promising of Lorck's stations in life, as he was here in one of the most important humanist centres of Europe, due to the prolific publishing houses, with Plantin's as the most important. A bronze medal to his honour was struck there by Etienne de Hollande (now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna). And he published his only more substantial book, the Soldan Soleyman Tvrckhischen Khaysers, vnd auch Furst Ismaelis au√ü Persien, Whare vnd eigendtliche contrafectung vnd bildtnu√ü (i.e. The True and Real Counterfeits and Pictures of the Turkish Emperor Sultan S√ºleyman and Prince Ismail from Persia), in April 1574. The book, the only known copy of which perished in the firestorms in Hamburg in June 1943, caused by the allied forces' Operation Gomorrha, contained two bust portraits and two full-length portraits of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and of the Persian envoy to the High Porte, Isma√Øl, still known today, as well as accompanying poems by Conrad Leicht and Paulus Melissus. A lengthy announcement (quoted in Hans Harbeck's dissertation from 1911Harbeck (1911)) of a book to come that would describe the entirety of Turkish society seemingly presaged the publication of the work underway of the so-called \\"Turkish Publication\\" (Wolgerissene und geschnittene Figuren...). The Turkish Publication Melchior Lorck, The Janissaries' cook, 1575. Copenhagen, The Royal Library Melchior Lorck Atik Ali Pasha mosque, woodcut, 1576. Copenhagen, The Royal Library While still employed as Hartschier Lorck proceeded with the idea of publishing a book on Turkey, as he promised in the Soldan Soleyman.... In a letter to the Danish king, Frederik II, of May 19, 1575,Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2020), Document no. 1575 ‚Äì May 19 he indicated that he had problems financing his publication and asked for economic support to this end. In the years from 1570 to this date, Lorck had managed to get a number of blocks for woodcuts cut after his drawings from Turkey (most likely in Antwerp). 12 woodcuts with motifs with architectural monuments are dated 1570, while 5 woodcuts with members of the Turkish army and its entourage are dated 1575. In the years to come this core would grow into a total of the 128 woodcuts that make up the Turkish Publication as we know it today. Only a few preparatory drawings have come down to us, at least one suggesting that the entire range of planned motifs was somewhat larger than what we know of (i.e. the drawing with The Shooing of Oxen in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg (inv. no. 38 225)). The possible fate of the Turkish woodcuts What happened to the artist as well as to the large stock of woodblocks for the publication by the time he disappears from the records in 1583, is not known. Two copies of a prototype title page for the publication exist, both initially from 1575, and each with an inserted title on top with the same text (Wolgerissene und geschnittene Figuren in Kupffer und Holz durch. Den Kunstreichen und weitber√ºmten Melcher Lorch f√ºr die Mahler Bildthawer und Kunstliebenden. an tag gegeben) and the same date, but in different print type.One in the St√§dtisches Museum Flenburg, one in the Copenhagen Printroom . Whereas this 1619-edition never to have come into fruition, 7 years later the woodcuts were published in Hamburg, with the same title. It is therefore possible that the blocks had been in Hamburg ever since Lorck's death. The leading Lorck-scholar, Dr. Erik Fischer, the former keeper of the Copenhagen Printroom, suggests that the Turkish Publication came out only as a torso of what it was intended to be. In the re-publication of the woodcuts from 1646, a register of the motifs was attached, however it does not fit the prints and it points to an \\"original\\" where more can be learned. It is Dr. Fischer's thesis that that \\"original\\" was a written manuscript that would supplement the woodcuts and thus fulfil the promise given in the 1574 Soldan Soleyman... of a thorough description of Turkish society, life and customs. This idea is corroborated by the context in which the woodcuts are reused in another Hamburg-based publisher, Eberhard Werner Happel s bulletins on the Turkish wars of the 1680s and descriptions of Turkish society. Here, bits of descriptions turn up that, according to Dr. Fischer's thesis, could have been taken from a text very closely connected to the woodcuts and based on personal experience with the Turks, i.e. a text by Lorck himself.For the entire argument and a full treatment of the Turkish Publication with all the mentioned texts, as well as a facsimile reproduction of the 1626 reproduction, see Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010),Publication homepage A ‚Äò‚ÄôTrachtenbuch‚Äô‚Äô Project A substantial number of drawings, the bulk of which was produced in the early 1570s, show individual figures and groups in their indigenous costumes. Lorck seems to have planned a book of costumes ‚Äì a very popular genre in his day. The drawings, all inscribed with the region or city that they depict the costumes of, are all preparatory drawings for woodcuts, however, no such prints have come down to us, and the project remained unfinished. Appointed to the Danish king Melchior Lorck, King Frederik II, 1582, engraving When Lorck had received his travel stipend from King Christian III in 1549, he promised to go away for four years only to return and step into the service of the king or his successor. He had not exactly kept that promise, always interrupted by more interesting prospects or more or less ill fortune. However, in 1578 he applied to the imperial court for a small fiefdom in Silesia, Guppern (unidentified).Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-1010), Documents no. 1578 ‚Äì March 7 (a)-(b) and Document no. 1579 ‚Äì March When the application was dismissed by the emperor, now Rudolph II, he instead applied in 1579 for a pension and relief from duty as ‚Äò‚ÄôHartschier‚Äô‚Äô, both granted graciously.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-1010), Documents nos. 1579 ‚Äì June 15, 1579 ‚Äì July 9 (a)-(c) and 1579 ‚Äì September 17 On February 19, 1583 he turns up in the state account books of Denmark with the note ‚ÄúHis Royal Majesty has, on February 19, 1580, employed Melcher Lorichs as a painter and counterfeiter‚Äù.Document no. 1580 ‚Äì February 19 His works for the king have been lost, if any substantial body of works was ever produced, which is doubtful. An engraved portrait of the king, a unique woodcut that seems to have meant as frontispiece to the rules for the Order of the Elephant, and a painted full-length portrait of king Frederik II, the first of its kind in Danish art, is all that survives today. Apart from this, it appears Lorck spent most of his energy in having produced what amount to the bulk of the woodcuts for the ‚Äò‚ÄôTurkish Publication‚Äô‚Äô. Last traces Senegalese woman, pen and ink, 1583 On November 10, 1582 the king dismissed Lorck from service, stating only that his dismissal would be honourable if he returned his letter of appointment.Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1582 ‚Äì November 10 The last payment is recorded on March 4, 1583,Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1583‚Äì March 4 which is also the last certain source that he was still alive.A rather enigmatic payment record in 1588 from the empirical treasury in Vienna may be due to a slip of the pen, as Lorck is mentioned with all the other ‚Äò‚ÄôHartschier‚Äô‚Äôs that had attended the funeral of Maximilian II in 1576 and were to be reimbursed for their mourning apparel 12 years earlier, see:Fischer, Bencard and Rasmussen (2009-2010), Document no. 1588 ‚Äì December 31. Also, an attribution of a map of a part of the River Elbe from 1594 to Lorck cannot be confirmed today, as the map burned in the fire of Hamburg in 1842, see: Lappenberg (1847). Posthumous reception Melchior Lorck was well known at the end of the 16th century and mentioned by e.g. Karel van Mander in the Schilder-boeck, even if he did not get a chapter of his own. And he continued to be mentioned in accounts of Flensburg as the city's famous son. After the publication of the Turkish Publication in 1626, he inspired a number of artists and his renderings of the Turks became one of the standard references for the Western European view of the Turks. Both Nicolas Poussin and Stefano della Bella used the book for inspiration, and Rembrandt owned a copy of it. Lorck is not widely known today, but often referred to in studies of the relationship between Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and in oriental studies.

Proksch, the owner of the cargo, also then owner of famous Viennese confectioners Demel, claimed 212 mio. schilling (ca. US$20 million) from his insurance company, saying that the cargo was expensive uranium mining equipment. He was subsequently convicted in 1991 of the murder of six crew (of the crew of 12) who were killed by the explosion, and died in prison. The Lucona was located by American shipwreck hunter David Mearns in January 1991; his first very deep water wreck, at 4,200 metres (13,799 feet). Working as a Project Manager with Eastport International, he found that the ship had been sunk by a time bomb. While fraud had been suspected, investigations were obstructed by powerful Austrian politicians who were friends of Proksch. Eventually several ex-ministers were convicted over their involvement. The ex- Minister of Foreign Affairs was sentenced for forging documents authenticating the cargo. Two other ministers were dismissed for obstructing the investigations. The Minister of Defense Karl L√ºtgendorf, a shareholder in the Proksch firm, had given permission to deliver explosives to sabotage the ship and committed suicide when that became known. Proksch fled to the Philippines in 1988 after Hans Pretterebner published a book about the scandal. Returning to Vienna in 1989 incognito, he was recognized and arrested. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison on March 11, 1991, and a year later the sentence was increased to life in prison. He died on June 27, 2001 during heart surgery.

As of 2020, no GM wheat is grown commercially, although many field tests have been conducted, with one wheat variety, Bioceres HB4, obtaining regulatory approval from the Argentinian government. Background Wheat is a natural hybrid derived from interspecies breeding. It is theorized that wheat's ancestors (Triticum monococcum, Aegilops speltoides, and Aegilops tauschii, all diploid grasses) hybridized naturally over millennia somewhere in West Asia, to create natural polyploid hybrids, the best known of which are common wheat and durum wheat. Wheat (Triticum spp.) is an important domesticated grass used worldwide for food. Its evolution has been influenced by human intervention since the dawn of agriculture. Interspecies transfer of genes continued to occur in farmers fields during the shift from the Paleolithic diet to the diet adopted by humans following the Neolithic Revolution, or first green revolution. During the transition from a hunter-gatherer social structure to more agrarian societies, humans began to cultivate wheat and further transform it for their needs. Thus, the social and cultural roots of humans and the development of wheat have intertwined since before recorded history. This process resulted in various wheat species that are grown for specific purposes and climates. In 1873 Wilson cross-pollinated rye and wheat to create triticale. Further transformations using cytogenic hybridization techniques enabled Norman Borlaug, father of the second Green Revolution, to develop wheat species (the semidwarf varieties) that would grow in harsh environments. Recombinant DNA techniques were developed in the 1980s, work began on creating the first transgenic wheat, coincident with the third Green Revolution. Of the three most important cereals in the world (corn, rice and wheat), wheat was the last to be transformed by transgenic, biolistic methods in 1992, and by Agrobacterium methods in 1997.Plant Genetics/Genomics: Crops and Models Vol. 7: Genetics and Genomics of the Triticeae.

Monsanto received approval from the FDA for its use in food, but withdrew its EPA application in 2004, so the product was never marketed. It also received approval for use as food in Colombia. Studies conducted by Monsanto showed that its nutritional components are equivalent to nontransgenic commercially available wheat,Obert J.C., et al.

In 2010 Monsanto's partner in India, Mahyco, announced that it planned to seek approval to market GM wheat in India in the next three to five years. Escape of GM wheat seed In 1999 scientists in Thailand claimed they discovered glyphosate-resistant wheat in a grain shipment from the Pacific Northwest of the United States, even though transgenic wheat had never been approved for sale and was only ever grown in test plots. No one could explain how the transgenic wheat got into the food supply.Hannelore Sudermann for the Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA). October 14, 1999 Genetically Altered Wheat Flagged ‚Äì Thailand Detects Shipment Not Cleared for Commercial Sales In May 2013 a strain of genetically-engineered glyphosate-resistant wheat was found on a farm in Oregon. Extensive testing confirmed the wheat as a variety ‚Äì MON71800. The wheat had been developed by Monsanto but never been approved or marketed after the company had tested it between 1998 and 2005. The unexplained presence of this type of wheat presents a problem to wheat growers when buyers demand GMO-free wheat. Japan subsequently suspended import of soft white wheat from the United States. A Kansas farmer sued Monsanto over the release, saying it had caused the price of wheat grown in the US to fall. Monsanto suggested that the presence of this wheat was likely an act of sabotage. On Jun 14, 2013, the USDA announced: \\"As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm. All information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of GE wheat in commerce.\\"Staff, Food Safety News. June 17, 2013. GMO Wheat Found in Oregon Was Isolated Incident, Says USDA As of August 30, 2013, while the source of the GM wheat remained unknown, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had all resumed placing orders, and the disruption of the export market was minimal.Associated Press. August 30, 2013. Source of GMO wheat in Oregon remains mystery The investigation was closed in 2014 after the APHIS had exhausted all leads but had not found any evidence that the wheat had entered commercial supply. In 2019, the USDA announced that genetically modified wheat plants engineered to resist Roundup were detected in an unplanted field in Washington state. Regulation The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.

However, risk may be ignored, tolerated, or minimized and may even be considered to add to the excitement of the activity. The concept was developed by Marvin Zuckerman of the University of Delaware. In order to assess this trait he created a personality test called the Sensation Seeking Scale. This test assesses individual differences in terms of sensory stimulation preferences. So there are people who prefer a strong stimulation and display a behavior that manifests a greater desire for sensations and there are those who prefer a low sensory stimulation. The scale is a questionnaire designed to measure how much stimulation a person requires and the extent to which they enjoy the excitement. Zuckerman hypothesized that people who are high sensation seekers require a lot of stimulation to reach their Optimal Level of Arousal. When the stimulation or sensory input is not met, the person finds the experience unpleasant. Components Sensation- seeking can be divided into 4 traits: * Thrill- and adventure-seeking: Desire for outdoor activities involving unusual sensations and risks, such as skydiving, scuba diving, high-speed driving and flying. * Experience-seeking: Referring to new sensory or mental experiences through unconventional choices, also including psychedelic experiences, social nonconformity and desire to associate with unconventional people. * Disinhibition: Preference of \\"out of control\\" activities such as wild parties, drinking and illegal activities * Boredom susceptibility: intolerance of repetition or boring people, and restlessness in such conditions. The most recent version of the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS-V) has demonstrated moderate validity and reliability. It has been adapted for use with children. Relationship to personality models Zuckerman began researching the personality trait he came to call \\"sensation seeking\\" in 1969. Zuckerman argues that sensation-seeking is one of a handful of \\"core traits\\" that can be used to describe human personality. Although other researchers including Eysenck, and Costa and McCrae considered the trait to be related to extraversion, factor-analytic studies conducted by Zuckerman suggested that sensation seeking is relatively independent of other major dimensions of personality. A number of studies have found positive correlations between sensation seeking, especially the experience seeking component, and openness to experience. Additionally, negative correlations have been found between agreeableness from the NEO-PI-R and total sensation seeking, and the boredom susceptibility and disinhibition subscales. The honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model has been shown to be negatively correlated with sensation seeking and risk taking behaviors.de Vries, R.E., de Vries, A., & Feij, J.A. (2009). Sensation seeking, risk-taking, and the HEXACO model of personality. Personality and Individual Differences, 47, pp. 536-540. In Zuckerman's alternative five model of personality, sensation seeking has been incorporated as a facet of the broader trait of impulsive sensation seeking. Within Eysenck's \\"Big Three\\" model of personality, impulsive sensation seeking is most strongly related to psychoticism and within the Big Five personality traits it is primarily related to (low) conscientiousness. Sensation-seeking has a strong correlation with the Novelty Seeking scale of Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory. Furthermore, he presents evidence that this characteristic is influenced by genes. So, sensation- seeking parents are likely to have sensation-seeking children.  Features  Zuckerman's research has found that high sensation seekers tend to seek high levels of stimulation in their daily lives. The scale predicts how well people tolerate sensory deprivation sessions. Sensation seeking increases with age from childhood to adolescence. It then starts to decrease after it peaks in the late adolescence years of 18-20. The correlation is -.30 between age and sensation seeking.Larsen, Randy J., and David M.

However, boredom susceptibility remains stable across the life span, unlike the other facets of sensation seeking. Substantial gender differences have been found in sensation seeking, with males scoring significantly higher than females. In American samples, males significantly outscored females in total sensation seeking, thrill and adventure seeking, boredom susceptibility, and disinhibition. Studies in Australia, Canada, and Spain found similar gender differences in total sensation seeking, thrill and adventure seeking and boredom susceptibility. Marital status is also related to sensation seeking, as studies have found that divorced males tend to be higher in the trait compared to single or married men.  Behaviour  Sensation seeking is related to driving speed, with both males and females high in sensation seeking more likely to engage in speeding. High sensation seekers are more likely to ignore traffic rules and engage in high risk behaviours associated with accidents and/or crashes resulting in driver injuries. Alcohol use has been linked to sensation seeking, especially the disinhibition and experience seeking subscales. Peer influences and sensation seeking appear to mutually reinforce each other in their influence on substance use. Research has found that peer sensation seeking levels are predictive of drug use. Furthermore, individuals are likely to associate with peers whose sensation seeking levels are similar to their own, further influencing drug and alcohol use. High sensation seekers tend to engage in high risk sexual behavior such as having multiple sexual partners, and failing to use condoms to protect themselves against disease. They also tend to have permissive sexual attitudes. Risky sexual behaviour is particularly related to the disinhibition facet of sensation seeking. High sensation seekers are also more likely to be unfaithful to partners whilst in a committed romantic relationship. High sensation seekers prefer listening to arousing music such as hard rock rather than classical instrumental. High sensation seekers are also more likely to enjoy surreal paintings over representational ones or unpleasant art forms (defined as presence of violent or aggressive content or themes of death and despair).  Occupational choices  Sensation seekers tend to prefer occupations involving novel, stimulating, and unconventional activities and unstructured tasks requiring flexibility, such as scientific and social service professions. Low sensation seekers tend to prefer more structured, well-defined tasks involving order and routine such as homemaking or teaching.

He is also a former fellow of the Young Foundation. and World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Lord Wei is also the Chairman of the Conservative Friends of the Chinese. Early life Lord Wei is the son of Hong Kong parents with ethnic Hakka ancestry. Wei's father was a pastor who moved to Britain in the 1970s. He was born in Watford and grew up in Milton Keynes and Tooting, London. Education Lord Wei was educated at the Sir Frank Markham Community School, a state comprehensive school in Milton Keynes (since closed, and replaced by the Milton Keynes Academy on the same site),End of an Era as School's Out for the Last Time Published by: MiltonKeynes.co.uk Date: 21 July 2009. Retrieved 27 November 2012 where some of the pupils snorted cocaine and even burned down a wing of the school, and bullied him for taking his studies seriously. However, in a later account of his school life, Wei appeared to contradict this account, stating that as he 'got good grades, but was also sporty', he was never targeted or bullied. The only pupil from his school year to attend the University of Oxford, he studied Modern Languages at Jesus College. He has a working knowledge of Cantonese, French and German. Life and career After graduating from Jesus College, Oxford, Wei worked at McKinsey & Company for three years, where he came to know Brett Wigdortz, who founded Teach First in 2002. In 2006, after three years at Teach First and a short stint in social venture capital, Wei joined the children's charity Absolute Return for Kids (ARK) where he helped to set up Future Leaders, a programme seeking to attract, develop and place high-potential teachers and future leaders of urban schools. Founding the Shaftesbury Partnership Around the same time as helping to set up Future Leaders, in early 2006, Wei founded the Shaftesbury Partnership, an organisation which seeks to emulate the great social reformers of the Victorian era by creating scalable social reforms. The Shaftesbury Partnership are currently working on a number of projects around housing, unemployment and healthcare. Through the Shaftesbury Partnership, Wei co-founded The Challenge Network, an independent charity which exists to \\"inspire and connect people to strengthen their community\\". The Challenge Network runs a two-month civic service programme called The Challenge which has attracted strong interest from both government and opposition. In 2011, the Shaftesbury Partnership working with Johnson & Johnson and Queens Nursing Institute and Buckinghamshire New University piloted NurseFirst ‚Äì a clinicians in the community development programme to produce a network of innovators who can create real change for patients, people and communities. In 2013, a report on the pilot, 2 years on, concluded that first cohort of clinicians showed quantitative and qualitative improvements in their confidence, their leadership skills, their ability to innovate and their ability to make clinical innovation happen. They produced financially sustainable business plans for ¬£1.2 million of cash releasing savings over 3 years. The programme is now being scaled up.  Social reform  On 18 May 2010 at the launch of the New Coalition Government policies on Big Society to a group of community leaders, Lord Wei was appointed as an unpaid Government Adviser on Big Society. He was based at the Office for Civil Society in the Cabinet Office where he worked one day a week, and advised the Government on all aspects of taking forward the Big Society and driving implementation across government. Press Release: General statement in response to Nat Wei‚Äôs nomination to House of Lords and appointment as advisor to the Government on Big SocietyAt the launch event, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced that Wei would also be appointed a life peer. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 3 June 2010 as Baron Wei, of Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. He is the third person of Chinese ethnic origin to become a member of the House of Lords, after Baroness Dunn (who is not domiciled in the UK) and the late Lord Chan; the third person of Hong Kong ancestry to become a House of Lords member, after Baroness Dunn and the late Lord Kadoorie; and the first-ever member of Chinese origin to be British-born. He is also one of the youngest people to have been made a life peer, at the age of 33.Lord Redesdale was slightly younger than Wei when he was made a life peer in 2000; however he had sat in the House of Lords as a hereditary peer prior to the reforms of 1999. Due to his role as Government Advisor Lord Wei stepped down from any direct, formal involvement in the organisations he had previously been involved with. On 24 May 2011, Lord Wei announced his decision to step down from his role as Government Advisor on Big Society to help as a volunteer to drive the practical development of Big Society ideas in communities. The Prime Minister, David Cameron said 'Nat has worked incredibly hard over two years to help develop policies that support the Big Society. He has played an important role in delivering key initiatives like Community Organisers, National Citizen Service, and the Big Society Bank.\\" Previously, Lord Wei had also cited personal financial difficulties that he had suffered as a result of the demands of his part-time position.  Chinese heritage  Lord Wei's ancestry can be traced back to a village in Zhuhai, on the southern coast of Canton (now Guangdong). His ancestral home is two villages away from that of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, about whom incidentally, Wei enjoys reading and learning. As the only current ethnic Chinese peer in The House of Lords, and the first member of Chinese ethnic origin to have been born and brought up in the UK, Lord Wei takes an interest in British Chinese community issues, particularly in social reform. He is also interested in economic and cultural ties between the UK and China. His focus in working with East Asia comprises now of work within the Conservative Party to help engage ethnic East Asian voters and help them gain the voice, representation and participation that they need as Britain's third largest minority group. Up to July 2015, he worked in Parliament through the All Party Parliamentary Group APPG for East Asian Business which he chaired, the All Party Parliamentary China Group of which he was the vice-Chair (special focus on Hong Kong), and the All Party Parliamentary Group for Trade and Investment of which he was treasurer to promote better trade and political and cultural links between the UK and East Asia and work to encourage the next generation of East Asians and other diaspora to develop the leadership skills to play a greater role in public life, in society, and business, and in harnessing the resources that East Asians have globally and locally both financial and non- financial to address global and local problems today. The All Party Parliamentary Group for East Asian Business was discontinued after the May 2015 election. In 2012, Manchester local government commissioned Lord Wei to write a report on how Manchester can best engage with China. Following that Report, a Manchester-China Forum was established which hosts regular activities to help member businesses share information and knowledge, including seminars, meet-the-buyer events, and other networking opportunities. Lord Wei continues to work as a non-executive director of the Forum.  Other  In 2013, Lord Wei was invited to become a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.

History  Erik Buell founded Erik Buell Racing in November 2009 following the shutdown of his previous company, Buell Motorcycle Company, by parent company/majority stakeholder Harley-Davidson. Erik Buell Racing's first efforts were directed toward production of complete, race-only motorcycles and parts based on the Buell 1125R production model, under license from Harley- Davidson, to support privateer racers. On July 1, 2013, Hero MotoCorp, a motorcycle manufacturer based in India, acquired 49.2% stake in the company for $25 million.

The auction had no bidders, and a move where the court-appointed receiver sought to sell the assets by accepting a pre-emptive offer from a private liquidation-company specializing in breaking-up company remnants was blocked by the judge, to allow more time for any potential new buyers to prepare their submissions, re-scheduling the hearing for early January 2016.Rick Romell. \\"Judge declines to approve sale of motorcycle company's assets\\".

Life and disappearance  Chung and his family were South Korean immigrants who arrived in the United States in 1973. According to his father, Chung Soo-oh, he had joined the Army to get education benefits. He disappeared and was reported AWOL on June 5, 1979, while serving with his unit near Bayreuth, West Germany (about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the borders of Czechoslovakia and East Germany). After 30 days he became classified as a deserter. He was 22 and a Private First Class.\\"South Korean, Who Joined U.S. Army, Reportedly Defected to North Korea\\", The Washington Post. September 13, 1979. Joe Ritchie and Jaehoon Ahn. A28. Two months after his disappearance in Europe, North Korea's international broadcasting service Radio Pyongyang (now Voice of Korea) announced his defection, stating that he \\"could no longer endure the disgraceful life of national insult and maltreatment he had to lead in the U.S. imperialist aggressor Army.\\" The other five men who disappeared into North Korea did so by directly crossing the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In 2004, filmmaker Nicholas Bonner (co-creator of the documentary Crossing the Line) reported that he heard Chung had died of natural causes.  Claims of abduction  Chung's family and Korean-American groups strongly believed that he had been abducted and was not a defector, as widely believed. They compared his disappearance to several documented abductions by North Korean agents, most notably the kidnap of actress Choi Eun-hee. Officials of the United States Department of State and the Pentagon at the time stated that they had no reason to doubt North Korea's claims of defection. They made no major inquiries into the matter because Chung had no access to classified information and was not a security threat.

In the Puranas and Ramayana It is said that Parashurama was mediating on Mahendragiri when Lord Rama broke the sacred bow of Shiva. Mahendragiri is situated in Gajapati district, Odisha. Legend says that it is the place where Lord Parashurama, a chiranjeevi stays eternally and performs tapas. Temples, which are said to be built by the Pandavas are seen. The main festival observed here is Shivaratri. Geology This is the second highest mountain peak of Odisha after Deomali in Koraput district. It has interesting archaeological remains. Biodiversity hot spot Mahendragiri hill and its surrounding areas are recognized as a biodiversity hot spot due to numerous medicinal plants and other species that are found here. A haven for medicinal plants, Mahendragiri Hills, which is part of the Eastern Ghats, is home to over 600 flowering plants.

Historically, such data structures were used on uniprocessor machines with operating systems that supported multiple computing threads (or processes). The term concurrency captured the multiplexing/interleaving of the threads' operations on the data by the operating system, even though the processors never issued two operations that accessed the data simultaneously. Today, as multiprocessor computer architectures that provide parallelism become the dominant computing platform (through the proliferation of multi-core processors), the term has come to stand mainly for data structures that can be accessed by multiple threads which may actually access the data simultaneously because they run on different processors that communicate with one another. The concurrent data structure (sometimes also called a shared data structure) is usually considered to reside in an abstract storage environment called shared memory, though this memory may be physically implemented as either a \\"tightly coupled\\" or a distributed collection of storage modules. Basic principles Concurrent data structures, intended for use in parallel or distributed computing environments, differ from \\"sequential\\" data structures, intended for use on a uni-processor machine, in several ways. Most notably, in a sequential environment one specifies the data structure's properties and checks that they are implemented correctly, by providing safety properties. In a concurrent environment, the specification must also describe liveness properties which an implementation must provide. Safety properties usually state that something bad never happens, while liveness properties state that something good keeps happening. These properties can be expressed, for example, using Linear Temporal Logic. The type of liveness requirements tend to define the data structure. The method calls can be blocking or non-blocking. Data structures are not restricted to one type or the other, and can allow combinations where some method calls are blocking and others are non-blocking (examples can be found in the Java concurrency software library). The safety properties of concurrent data structures must capture their behavior given the many possible interleavings of methods called by different threads. It is quite intuitive to specify how abstract data structures behave in a sequential setting in which there are no interleavings. Therefore, many mainstream approaches for arguing the safety properties of a concurrent data structure (such as serializability, linearizability, sequential consistency, and quiescent consistency) specify the structures properties sequentially, and map its concurrent executions to a collection of sequential ones. To guarantee the safety and liveness properties, concurrent data structures must typically (though not always) allow threads to reach consensus as to the results of their simultaneous data access and modification requests. To support such agreement, concurrent data structures are implemented using special primitive synchronization operations (see synchronization primitives) available on modern multiprocessor machines that allow multiple threads to reach consensus. This consensus can be achieved in a blocking manner by using locks, or without locks, in which case it is non-blocking. There is a wide body of theory on the design of concurrent data structures (see bibliographical references). Design and implementation Concurrent data structures are significantly more difficult to design and to verify as being correct than their sequential counterparts. The primary source of this additional difficulty is concurrency, exacerbated by the fact that threads must be thought of as being completely asynchronous: they are subject to operating system preemption, page faults, interrupts, and so on. On today's machines, the layout of processors and memory, the layout of data in memory, the communication load on the various elements of the multiprocessor architecture all influence performance. Furthermore, there is a tension between correctness and performance: algorithmic enhancements that seek to improve performance often make it more difficult to design and verify a correct data structure implementation. A key measure for performance is scalability, captured by the speedup of the implementation. Speedup is a measure of how effectively the application is using the machine it is running on. On a machine with P processors, the speedup is the ratio of the structures execution time on a single processor to its execution time on T processors. Ideally, we want linear speedup: we would like to achieve a speedup of P when using P processors. Data structures whose speedup grows with P are called scalable. The extent to which one can scale the performance of a concurrent data structure is captured by a formula known as Amdahl's law and more refined versions of it such as Gustafson's law. A key issue with the performance of concurrent data structures is the level of memory contention: the overhead in traffic to and from memory as a result of multiple threads concurrently attempting to access the same locations in memory. This issue is most acute with blocking implementations in which locks control access to memory. In order to acquire a lock, a thread must repeatedly attempt to modify that location. On a cache-coherent multiprocessor (one in which processors have local caches that are updated by hardware to keep them consistent with the latest values stored) this results in long waiting times for each attempt to modify the location, and is exacerbated by the additional memory traffic associated with unsuccessful attempts to acquire the lock.

Early life and background  Tablot was born in London in 1861, the eldest son of John Gilbert Talbot, Conservative Member of Parliament for West Kent and for Oxford University, and of The Hon Meriel Sarah Talbot, n√©e Lyttelton, eldest daughter of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton. Through his mother he was related to several prominent members of the Lyttelton family, such as Alfred Lyttelton, Arthur Lyttelton, and George William Spencer Lyttelton. Through his father he was the nephew of Edward Talbot, Bishop of Winchester. Talbot's father was educated at Charterhouse, but his disapproval of the migration of that school to Godalming caused him in 1873 to send his son to Winchester College. In 1880 Talbot gained a junior studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he obtained first-class honours in classical moderations (1882) and in literae humaniores (1884). In 1886 was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. A career in the Church or at the bar was obvious for Talbot. On his father's side he was sixth in descent from Lord Chancellor Talbot, while on his mother's side he was thirteenth in descent from Sir Thomas Littleton, judge of the Common Pleas, and ninth in descent from Lord Chancellor Bromley. His grandfather, John Chetwynd Talbot (a son of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot), whose law library he inherited, had a highly successful career at the parliamentary bar in its busiest days of railway promotions. As all these ancestors were members of the Inner Temple Talbot followed them, and was there called to the bar in 1887. He took silk in 1906, became a bencher of his Inn in 1914, and was its treasurer in 1936. Until late in his career at the bar his busy practice was mainly before parliamentary committees, and in work of a like character, such as in the Railway and Canal Commission. He was also a learned ecclesiastical lawyer, and was eventually chancellor of six dioceses. He was counsel to the University of Oxford from 1915 to 1923. During the latter part of his career he increasingly appeared before the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Among his prominent appearances were Bowman v Secular Society and Viscountess Rhondda's Claim in the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords. Of the latter case, Lord Greene, future Master of the Rolls, thought that Talbot's argument, before a troublesome and divided tribunal, was the finest effort of advocacy which he ever heard. In October 1916 Lord Buckmaster, considering Talbot for a vacant judgeship in the King's Bench Division, consulted the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, who dissuaded him (to Buckmaster's subsequent regret) on the ground that promotion from the parliamentary bar would not be popular with the profession, and Henry McCardie was appointed instead. In the opinion of Sir Frank Douglas MacKinnon If Talbot had been appointed then, his judicial career would probably have ended in the House of Lords.  Judicial career  In November 1923, on the retirement of Mr Justice Darling, Lord Cave recommended Talbot's appointment as a Justice of the King's Bench Division of the High Court, and he was given the customary knighthood in 1924. On the bench he displayed every quality of the ideal judge. He had learning, dignity, industry, patience, and courtesy; his decisions were almost invariably right, and on most occasions were thought to be so by the Court of Appeal. And (although he tried at least one sensational murder case) his name was unknown to the readers of the popular newspapers. Following his appointment to sit in the Commercial Court, he started there with a protest against one with so little experience of that class of work being selected. That, however, was the fault of a very needless modesty‚Äîhe did the work as well as he did everything else. In criminal trials on circuit, of which he had had little experience at the bar, he had no contemporary superior. Towards the end of 1936 Talbot's powers, both physical and mental, began to fail. In June 1937 he resigned, and thereupon was sworn of the Privy Council. His resignation would probably have taken place earlier if he had not waited to be present at Winchester, on 29 May, when seven Wykehamist judges were received ad portas. Winchester College was, next to his wife and family, Talbot's greatest object of devotion. He was a fellow from 1930 until he resigned shortly before his death, and for a time was sub-warden. In 1935 he was elected an honorary student of Christ Church, and he served for thirty- five years on the council of Keble College, Oxford. Talbot died on 11 July 1938 at Falconhurst, near Edenbridge, Kent, the pleasant estate created by his grandfather, and was buried at Markbeech near by. His wife survived him. Their elder son predeceased him in 1922; the younger son followed his father to the Inner Temple and the bar. His legal publications included Modern Decisions on Ritual (1934) and Law and Practice of Licensing (1896 and 1905).  Character  Talbot was a tall, handsome man with a fresh complexion. He was a tireless walker in the country, and his pleasure in walking was increased by his being an ardent and very learned botanist. He had a cold bath every morning, and was never known to wear an overcoat in town or country. His reading was widespread, and he remained a fine scholar throughout his life. When he left Oxford he set himself a great programme of Greek and Latin literature, and by the strict devotion of a fixed daily time he completed the task in upwards of thirty years. He was a great lover of music, especially of Handel, although he never played any instrument. Nature endowed him with a very hot temper, but his intense self-discipline concealed that fact. He was a very devout churchman, who went to the early communion every Sunday and on all major saints' days. Some foolish person allegedly once asked Charles Gore whether the law was a suitable career for a man of high ideals; the bishop answered: 'Do you know George Talbot?'

He has received two BAFTA awards and two international Emmy awards and his productions have received many other awards and nominations. He is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society. He divides his time between the UK and US. Eastman founded the independent production company Carnival Films and between 1980 and 2006 produced over 300 hours of television drama, eight feature films and 10 stage productions. In 2007 Carnival Films was sold to the Australian company Southern Star. Eastman continues to produce through his new production company, Batway Ltd. Early career Eastman was educated at the City of Norwich School and Jesus College, Cambridge. Between 1972 and 1975 he worked for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Concert Management, and between 1976 and 1979 he was the Music Tours Officer for the British Council. His first venture into film making was to make music documentaries. Carnival films The company now known as Carnival Films and Television Ltd was founded by Brian Eastman and the director Leszek Burzynski in 1978 and was originally called Picture Partnership Productions (PPP). Eastman and Burzynsky worked together on music documentaries, short films for the cinema and commercials. PPP was one of the first independent companies to be commissioned by the newly created Channel Four television in the UK, and the company's work then concentrated on drama productions. Burzynsky left the company in 1985 and the company was renamed Carnival Films (and Theatre) Ltd in 1989. At this time Carnival also expanded its activities into stage productions. In the mid 1990s the Australian company Southern Star acquired a shareholding in Carnival. In 2005 Gareth Neame joined Carnival as managing director and in 2006 Southern Star became the owners of the company. At this point Brian Eastman left Carnival, which was subsequently sold to NBC Universal. Television productions Between 1988 and 1994 he was joined at Carnival by Betty Willingale, following her retirement from the BBC. In the detective genre Eastman produced 70 hours of Agatha Christie's Poirot starring David Suchet; Rosemary and Thyme, starring Felicity Kendal; and Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs. In action/adventure he produced 40 hours of Bugs, and in comedy drama he produced the adaptations of Tom Sharpe's novels Blott on the Landscape and Porterhouse Blue. He produced the mini-series Traffik written by Simon Moore, which subsequently was adapted into a feature film directed by Steven Soderbergh. Other mini-series for Channel Four included The Big Battalions and The Fragile Heart. For TNT in the US, and the BBC, he produced The Grid, and for NBC in the US, and SKY, he produced The Tenth Kingdom. Feature films With Richard Attenborough, Eastman produced the feature film version of William Nicholson's Shadowlands, starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. Other movies with which he has been involved include Under Suspicion, starring Liam Neeson and Laura San Giacomo, and Wilt starring Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones. Stage productions Eastman's first stage production was Up on the Roof which was nominated for an Olivier Best Musical award. He was then joined at Carnival by Andrew Welch and together they produced Shadowlands, Misery etc. (Full list below) Recent activities Eastman started a new company, Batway Ltd, to concentrate on stage productions. Again working with Andrew Welch, he revived Shadowlands at Wyndhams Theatre in London, starring Charles Dance and Janie Dee. He co- produced the UK tour of Our House, the Madness musical, and presented in the West End the stage adaptation of Girl with a Pearl Earring and a new adaptation of Treasure Island. In January 2010 he presented the world premiere of Jane Prowse's adaptation of Jane Juska's A Round-Heeled Woman at the Theater Artaud in San Francisco starring Sharon Gless. Personal life Eastman is married to Christabel Albery, an avid gardener, for whom he created the gardener-detectives series Rosemary & Thyme. They have homes in London and Santa Monica, California.

The mission of the 6th OG is the planning and executing global aerial refueling, combatant commander airlift, and specialized missions for US and allied combat and support aircraft. The group extends US global power and global reach through employment of a mix of KC-135R and C-37 aircraft. The 6th Operations Group is a successor organization of the 6th Group (Composite), one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. During World War II, the 6th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), was a B-29 Superfortress group assigned to Twentieth Air Force flying bombardment operations against Japan. Its aircraft were identified by a \\"R\\" inside a Circle painted on the tail. History : For additional history and lineage, see 6th Air Mobility Wing Origins The 6th Operations Group's origins begin on 30 September 1919 as the United States Army Panama Canal Department 3d Observation Group, being stationed at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone. The unit controlled numerous miscellaneous Air Service light observation squadrons to provide protection for the Panama Canal area. In 1921 the group was redesignated the 6th Group (Observation) and in 1922, the 6th Group (Composite). The 6th flew such aircraft at the Curtiss R-4, DeHavilland 4-B, SE-5A, MG-3A, Piper L-4, P-12B and Martin B-10 and Douglas B-18 Bolo aircraft. Throughout the 1920s and 1930 the group participated in maneuvers, flying patrol missions, photographing the canal area, staging aerial reviews and making good-will flights to Central and South America. In 1933, the group became part of the larger 19th Composite Wing, which provided a central command and control organization for the Air Service units. In 1937, as the mission of the 6th moved toward bombardment, the War Department renamed it the 6th Bombardment Group. They continued to operate in the Canal Zone under the VI Bomber Command of the Sixth Air Force at Rio Hato AB, Albrook Field and Howard Field.

(U.S. Air Force photo) Free French Surcouf As events in Europe and the Far East unfolded, the 6th Bomb Group and its units moved towards a war footing. Starting in May 1940, ground training for junior officers, newly arrived at France Field, became of major importance. Local courses on armament, use of flares and the delicate and seldom practiced fusing of bombs were made practically daily matters of practical application. Communications were also being stressed, as qualified radio operators were in short supply, while the squadrons rotated in and out of Rio Hato Army Air Base on \\"live\\" bombing practice. On 4 June 1941, the first four-engine Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress was assigned to the Group. By November, all four of the B-17Bs had been assigned to the 7th Reconnaissance Squadron. Many alerts and false alarms of enemy aircraft were recorded in the first three months after the Japanese Pearl Harbor Attack, although, of course, these proved to be false alarms. As the early months of the war swept by, and as VI Bomber Command struggled to apportion its scarce resources to best advantage. In 1941 it was assigned to the new VI Bomber Command of Sixth Air Force with an antisubmarine mission on both the Caribbean and Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal. By 1943, the antisubmarine mission was taken over by the United States Navy, and the group was disbanded in November 1943. Author James Rusbridger examined the records of the 6th Heavy Bomber Group operations while in Panama. The records show the sinking of a large submarine the morning of 19 February 1942. Since no German submarine was lost in the area on that date, it is assumed the large submarine was the Free-French Surcouf, which was the largest submarine in the world at the time. Rusbridger suggested that a collision reported by the American freighter Thompson Lykes on the night of 18 February, sustained damaged to the submarine's radio antenna with the stricken vessel limping towards Panama. On 19 April 1944, the 6th Bombardment Group was reactivated at Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas, being formed as a B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bombardment Group. The reactivated group was initially assigned four newly constituted bomb squadrons, the 24th, 39th, 40th and 41st as its operational components. Due to a shortage of B-29s, the group was equipped with former II Bomber Command B-17 Flying Fortresses previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel. In May shortages in aircraft and equipment led to the 41st Bomb Squadron being inactivated, with its personnel being consolidated into other group squadrons and the 6th becoming a three squadron group (the 41st would be reactivated a month later as part of the 501st Bombardment Group, but was inactivated a second time, finally being deployed into combat with the 448th Bombardment Group). The 6th was eventually equipped with newly manufactured B-29 Superfortresses at Grand Island Army Airfield, Nebraska during the summer of 1944. In November the group was deployed to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, being assigned to the XXI Bomber Command 313th Bombardment Wing, being stationed at North Field, Tinian, The group entered combat by flying navigational escort for a major attack force bound for Iwo Jima. The 6th then began engaging in very long range bombardment missions over the Japanese Home Islands, striking Tokyo and other major Japanese cities and facilities during daylight high-altitude bombing raids, with crippling, non- stop incendiary raids which destroyed lines of communication, supply, and numerous kamikaze bases. On 25 May 1945, the 6th flew a low-altitude night mission through alerted enemy defenses to drop incendiary bombs on Tokyo, for which they received their first Distinguished Unit Citation. In addition to incendiary raids, the 6th also participated in mining operations. By mining harbors in Japan and Korea in July 1945, the group contributed to the blockade of the Japanese Empire earning their second Distinguished Unit Citation. The 6th's final World War II mission came on 14 August 1945, with the dropping of 500-pound general-purpose bombs on the Marifu railroad yards at Iwakuni. Postwar era With the war over, the 6th dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war and took part in show-of-force flights over Japan. The unit remained on Tinian until February 1946 during which time the group largely demobilized as part of the \\"Sunset Project\\", with some aircraft being sent as reclamation on Tinian; others being returned to the United States for storage at aircraft depots in the southwest. By Christmas, the group fleet was reduced to 30 or fewer planes. Many of the remaining veterans signed for \\"any conditions of travel\\" to get home, arriving three weeks later in Oakland, California, where troop trains scattered them for points of discharge close to their homes. The unit moved to Clark Field in the Philippines where it was reassigned to the postwar Far East Air Forces 1st Air Division. At Clark its remaining aircraft and personnel were consolidated into other units. It was again reassigned in June 1947 to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa as a paper unit where it was inactivated in 1948. In January 1951, the group was activated as the operational component of the new 6th Bombardment Wing at Walker AFB, New Mexico as part of Strategic Air Command's Fifteenth Air Force. However all of the group's B-29 Superfortress were attached directly to the Wing organization, with the group having only one officer and one airman officially assigned to group headquarters. It was inactivated in June 1952 as part of the implementation of the postwar Tri-Deputate organization, as all operational flying squadrons were assigned directly to the 6th Bombardment Wing. Reactivation, from the 1990s Activated on 1 October 1996 with an air refueling mission as part of the Objective Wing structure of the 6th Air Refueling Wing. Elements deployed to Southwest Asia in July 1998 to refuel aircraft engaged in no-fly operations over northern Iraq. After January 2001, the group also provided airlift for the commanders of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command. It also refueled fighters providing security over the southeastern United States as part of homeland security after terrorist attacks against the United States in September 2001. MacDill KC-135‚Äôs have supported US military operations all over the world including refueling coalition aircraft during the war in Bosnia. Since 2001, personnel and aircraft deployed around the world to fulfill air refueling and aeromedical missions. The 6th has twice won the Air Mobility Rodeo Best Air Mobility Wing Award; in 2000 and 2005. The group's squadrons in the late 2010s include: * 6th Operations Support : Provides airfield operations management, air traffic control, weather services, intelligence support, combat tactics development and training, mission development, and manage aircrew training support operations. Manage flight records and KC-135R simulator training. * 50th Air Refueling Squadron : * 91st Air Refueling Squadron : * 99th Air Refueling Squadron, active duty associate unit with the 117th Air Refueling Wing at Birmingham IAP, Alabama. : All three Air Refuelling Squadrons operate the KC-135R Stratotanker, a long-range tanker aircraft capable of refueling a variety of other aircraft in mid-air, anywhere in the world and under any weather condition.

The project is being implemented through a partnership between the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Durban Investment Promotion Agency (DIPA),Durban Investment Promotion Agency, the eThekwini Municipality and the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry The purpose of the project is to sensitise industry in Durban to the risks and opportunities associated with climate change by creating a platform through which learning and communication between industry and government can take place.Unido South Africa, UNIDO Website. The project aims to establish a sustained partnership between the various industries organisations in Durban and the eThekwini Municipality. The partnership is seen as fundamental to responding to climate change and effectively contributing towards climate change mitigation and adaptation within the Durban metropolitan area.Climate Change, Durban Portal Website. Core areas The partnership covers three core areas. These are: industry specific interventions; institutional support and; outreach. Specific actions within these core areas assist the partnership in fulfilling its assigned purpose. Industry specific interventions As part of the first core area, industry specific interventions, engagement with three main existing structures within Durban's industries is seen as critical to the success of the project. These existing industry structures or groupings are: the Durban Automotive Cluster; the Durban Chemical Cluster (DCC) and; the eThekwini Maritime and Logistics Cluster (EMLC). These industries are brought together and a process of learning, through the conducting of a number of forums by the DICCPP is realised. These forumsDurban Automotive Cluster Website. designed specifically for the local industry cover issues such as greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments (which include carbon footprint calculations, life cycle and supply chain analysis and emission target development); financial implications or opportunities (which include information on carbon taxes, the carbon market, funding streams and investment opportunities); new technologies in renewable energy; waste management and finally; climate change response strategies.,Durban Chemical Cluster Website. Institutional support The second core area of the DICCPP is providing an institutional support mechanism for actively driving and monitoring industry climate change response activities in Durban. In this regard, the DICCPP is working closely with the eThekwini Energy Office to develop a climate change mitigation competency in the municipal structure.Durban Energy Office, Outreach The third core area of the DICCPP is called outreach and this is seen as an important part of the project in that it seeks to creates an awareness about climate change issues. A 'carbon footprint video' is being developed within the eThekwini communications department and serves to assist industry to quantify their carbon footprint. The DICCPP is also working with the Imagine Durban team running an Electricity Saving Competition within business in the city.Imagine Durban. Strategy The project's ultimate strategy is to establish a forum for industry to meet regularly to discuss climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. In doing so, this will facilitate investment and technology transfer between Durban and a similar project in China (also implemented by UNIDO). Once this has been established, it is envisaged that regular meetings with the government and other stakeholders will take place.

Today, there are 30 participating university consultancies all over Germany. JCNetwork Days One year after the foundation, the association organized the so-called JCNetwork Days for the first time. The JCNetwork Days is a week-long biannual meeting of the governing body consisting of numerous workshops and training events. The purpose of this meeting is the continuing education of the members through training as well as the establishment of valuable contacts between student consultants and companies. Representatives of several companies, students, professors and faculty members meet for discussions and training events. The assembly of the JCNetwork members and the report of the managing committee is also on the agenda of the JCNetwork Days. More than 500 students are regularly attending these meetings nowadays. Continuing Education and CJC At the end of 2002, the JCNetwork association introduced its own system of education and continuing training. Since then, the students have received credit points for attending the training events which are conducted by companies or members of the governing body. Students who have gathered enough credit points in different subject areas and who are able to show experience in consulting, receive the title \\"Certified Junior Consultant\\".

Tripods are typical, with a raised centre and conical actines but sometimes they are only similar to large conical triactines. They are distributed on a monolayer on the external tubes, delimiting the cormus. B. aspina has a sciaphile habitat.

Description Cormus massive, formed of thin, regular and tightly anastomosed tubes. Oscula are simple openings, surrounded by a thin membrane, and located on the top of short conical projections. They receive water from large water-collecting tubes. The skeleton comprises three kinds of spicule: triactines, tetractines and tripods. The triactines and tetractines are equiradiate and equiangular, with conical actines and blunt tips. The apical actine of the tetractines is shorter and thinner than the facial ones, and it is conical, sharp and covered with short spines. This actine is always projected towards the inside of the tubes. Tripods are more irregular than the triactines and tetractines, and frequently they are sagittal. They normally have their centre raised but sometimes look like large conical triactines. However, it is possible to distinguish them from large triactines because of the strong conical shape of their actines and because of their location. They are distributed on the surface of the external tubes in a monolayer, delimiting the cormus. Habitat is sciaphile.

It is found in shallow seas in the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, the Adriatic Sea and the Caribbean Sea. The specific epiphet \\"canariensis\\" was given to this species because it was first described from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. Description Arturia canariensis has a small, lacy structure and is a bright lemon yellow colour. It is an asconoid with many tiny flask-like tubes. Water is drawn in through fine holes near their base, the ostia, moved along by flagella and expelled from the oscula at the top, each osculum being a single exit formed from many fused ascon tubes. The skeleton is composed of large calcareous spicules called megascleres, made predominantly of calcite, forming a soft, fragile, supporting network. The whole sponge can grow to in diameter. Small individuals form tufts but larger ones have gentle folds, with oscula along their ridges. Distribution and habitat Arturia canariensis is found in the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, the Adriatic Sea and off the coast of Croatia. It is also found on the other side of the Atlantic in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, the Dry Tortugas, Florida and Bermuda. It is usually found at depths between . It grows on shady rock substrates and in caves but its preferred location is the underside of ledges formed by horizontal, plate- like layers of coral. It is often found growing in these locations with coralline algae and bryozoans in a rich, diverse community. In a 2007 survey of sponges off the coast of Georgia, Arturia canariensis was discovered in cryptic locations under rocks, in crevices and overgrown by other organisms. This was an extension of its previous known range. Biology Arturia canariensis is a filter feeder, sieving plankton and other organic material out of the current of water as it passes through the ostia. Both asexual reproduction by budding and sexual reproduction take place in Arturia canariensis. As in other species, each sponge is a hermaphrodite. Sperm is liberated into the sea and some is drawn into other sponges with the water current that passes through them. Fertilisation is then internal and the eggs are brooded in the ascon tubes of the sponge until they hatch. The free- swimming larvae are expelled through the oscula and disperse with the currents. After a few days they settle on the seabed and develop into juvenile sponges.

The species name refers to the brain-like appearance of the sponge. Description As the cormus of the holotype is fragmented, it was not possible to determine its organization, or establish the presence of water- collecting tubes. In some parts, the tubes have even collapsed, and it is impossible to distinguish them. The wall of the tubes is thin, comprising an irregular meshwork of triactines, tetractines and a few tripods, which are located only on external tubes. Projecting into the interior of the tubes are the apical actines of the tetractines. Spicules are equiangular and equiradiate triactines, tetractines, and tripods. Triactines are the most abundant spicules. The size of the triactines and tetractines is uniform. The actines of the triactines are conical or cylindrical, while the tetractines are always conical. They are straight, with a blunt tip. The apical actine of the tetractines is conical, sharp, straight and thinner and shorter than the facial ones. In the distal part, before the tip of the actine, there are sharp spines arranged in 3-4 rows. These spines are directed toward the tip of the actine. Some apical actines, particularly those of young spicules, have only vestigial spines. Tripods are not abundant, as they are located only on the surface of external tubes. They are approximately the same length as the other spicules, but their actines are much more conical and stout. The centre of these spicules is frequently raised, and their tips are sharp. When the centre is not raised, they are similar to large triactines, but it is still possible to recognize them by the shape of the stout conical actines.

The species name is derived from Ceylon, the former name of Sri Lanka. Description Cormus massive, formed of thin, irregular and tightly anastomosed tubes, with a reticulated surface. According to the original description, water-collecting tubes were present. The skeleton has no special organisation, comprising equiangular and equiradiate triactines. Actines are conical, with blunt tips, never rounded. Dendy described this species as a variety of Clathrina coriacea. He noted the presence of water-collecting tubes as ‚Äòsmall but prominent true oscula formed each by the coalescence of several tubes in a projection from the general surface‚Äô. He also found triactines measuring about 88 mm/8 mm, and ‚Äòfew very slender oxea‚Äô, which were probably trichoxeas. Klautau and Valentine studied the holotype. No trichoxeas were found, but these spicules are sometimes difficult to find. Klautau and Valentine therefore decided not to consider the presence of trichoxeas in their description. Klautau and Valentine elevated this variety to the status of a species because C. ceylonensis is very distinct from C. coriacea. Despite morphological similarities, such as the presence of water-collecting tubes and the size of the triactines, they can easily be distinguished. C. coriacea has undulated actines with a constriction near the tip, which is rounded or blunt, while C. ceylonensis has straight actines with blunt, unrounded tips. The distribution of C. coriacea seems to be restricted to northern Europe, while C. ceylonensis occurs only in the Indian Ocean.

The species epithet refers to the light yellow colour of the sponge. Description Cormus formed of thin, regularly anastomosed tubes. There are no water-collecting tubes. The skeleton of the tubes has no special organisation, comprising a thin meshwork of equiangular and equiradiate triactines. Actines are straight and conical, with a sharp distal tip. They are slightly undulated at the tip. Biochemical studies separated Clathrina clathrus from another yellow clathrina earlier named as Clathrina aurea, suggesting that C. clathrus is not widespread. Based on this result, Borojevic & Klautau (2000) recognized a specimen from New Caledonia as a new species. The main difference between this and other yellow clathrinas relates to the tip of the actines of the triactines, which is sharp in C. chrysea and rounded in C. clathrus and C. aurea. The yellow colour of the cormus and the skeleton composed only of triactines with cylindrical and undulated actines suggest that these clathrinas constitute a group of closely related species. Breitfuss (1897) reported a yellow clathrina he called C. clathrus in the Indo-Pacific region (Ternate). Borojevic & Klautau (2000) commented that he was probably referring to C. chrysea. In the original description of C. chrysea, the micrometry of the triactines was 105 mm (¬±9 mm)/10 mm (¬±1 mm).
